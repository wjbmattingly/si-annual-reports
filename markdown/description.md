Developed by [the Smithsonian's Data Science Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/) using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) and [txtAI](https://github.com/neuml/txtai).

A small subset of the Annual Reports are currently used for this beta version of the application. Due to the varied OCR quality of the annual reports, not all text data is available for each report. Only sentences larger than 7 words were indexed.
