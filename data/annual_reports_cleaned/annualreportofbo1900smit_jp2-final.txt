RicHarRD RATHBUN,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The act of Congress of 1846 establishing the Smithsonian Institution made it the legal place of deposit for all ‘‘ objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States,” and thereby created, in fact if not in name, a national museum. With extraordinary foresight the same act provided for additions to the national collections by exchange, donation, or other means, and for the arrangement and classification of the specimens in a manner best to facilitate their examination and study, all in such broad and comprehensive terms as to cover the full activities of a great establishment of this kind.
The Smithson fund at that time amounted to about half a million dollars, a sum then considered ample to meet the needs of the multifarious operations upon which it was proposed that the Smithsonian Institution should enter. In 1846 probably not more than one or two universities or learned establishments in America had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of Congress that the fund was sufficient both for the erection of a building and for the care of the collections which would be turned over to it or acquired by the national surveys and in other ways. The Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Government collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Congress began to make small yearly appropriations for the purpose. So inadequate, however, were the

<<<Page: 27>>>

sums voted, that for many years the slender income of the Institution was heavily drawn upon to insure the maintenance of what was then called the Smithsonian Museum, and justly enough, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a considerable portion of the collections were and still are the actual property of the Institution, through exploration, gift, and purchase, and at least a number of the officials in charge of the collections were employed at its expense.
The title ‘‘ National Museum,” first recognized by Congress in 1875, came into general use through the display of the Government collections at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876. This was the first exposition in this country in which the Government participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the people of the United States the existence of national collections at Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of college or local museums which prevailed up to that time. After its close the material brought back belonging to the Government, together with the extensive gifts made to the United States by private persons and foreign governments, forced the erection of a separate building, which brought the name ‘‘ National Museum” into greater prominence. Since that time Congress has in the main provided for the maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio the keeper—a form of goyernment insuring a consistent and uniform policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes, and the Institution, as well as all the scientific bureaus at Washington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and caring for the national collections.
With the primary object of preserving the collections in anthropology, biology, and geology obtained by the Government surveys, and of arranging them in a manner convenient for study, every effort is made to complete the representation in all departments of science and the arts capable of being illustrated in a material way. Extensive series of specimens, selected with reference to their educational value and the popular interest they may excite, and bearing appropriate labels, are exposed to view in the public halls. The duplicate specimens are made up into sets for exchange and for distribution to schools and colleges throughout the country. Papers descriptive of the collections, both technical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the extent of three or more vyolumes yearly; and, finally, the Museum has come to be regarded as a sort of bureau of information, being constantly called upon to answer

<<<Page: 28>>>

questions relating to every subject with which it might, in the remotest degree, be concerned.
The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Institution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. Some six years before the Institution had been formally established, however, a society was organized in Washington under the name of the National Institution, afterwards changed to the National Institute, which had for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and natural-history specimens, from both official and private sources, prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842. Rooms in the Patent Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was virtually recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Government collections held in Washington, and here was actually accumulated the nucleus of the National Museum. Another important service rendered by the society was, as Doctor Goode has said, in the direction of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Government of the United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at which it aimed, the National Institute became inactive in 1846, though it continued in existence until 1861. The Government collections in its possession, which were practically in the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the Patent Office until 1862, and a portion of the historical objects were retained there until 1883.
The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, which devolved upon its first Board of Regents, led in January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its important functions:
Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the
original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.!
‘Report of committee on organization, p. 20.

<<<Page: 29>>>

The transfer of Government collections to the Institution was, in accordance with the Congressional act of 1846, to be effected ‘‘ whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their reception.” In the absence of any stated limitations as to the time or character of arrangements, the date for accepting the obligation rested with the Regents, who, while confronted with the mandatory language of the law, were still forced to recognize the inadequacy of the Smithsonian fund for the support of so large an undertaking. The cost of the large and elaborate building, designed mainly for the accommodation of the museum and library, would have drawn heavily upon the principal of the fund had not a policy of delay prevailed, and thus nine years were allowed to elapse between the laying of the corner stone, in 1846, and the completion of the structure. This delay gave opportunity for influencing a change in sentiment, so that when, in 1857, the necessary arrangements became possible, Congress was prepared to vote means for building cases, for transferring the specimens from the Patent Office, and to a certain extent for the care and preservation of the collections. The appropriations continued very small, however, for many years, during which the Institution was obliged to make up the deficit.
The vast amount of material secured for the Government at the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which impelled the erection of a second building, for the exclusive use of the Museum, resulted in a larger and more systematic organization. Twenty-five more years have now elapsed, noteworthy for extensive explorations and surveys both at home and abroad. Material has been pouring in from these in a never-ceasing flow, first filling far beyond their ordinary capacity the halls and storerooms of the two large buildings, and then requiring to a greater and greater extent each year the use of outside quarters for their mere shelter. The main buildings are essentially fireproof, but not so the others, containing collections valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars, which, through accident or maliciousness, might at any time be destroyed.
While the collections in the custody of the National Institute remained at the Patent Office until 1858, material for a museum was, in the meantime, being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution. Reference has been made to the cabinet of minerals which had belonged to Smithson, unhappily destroyed by fire in 1865. The personal bent of Professor Baird, who became the Assistant Secretary of the Institution in 1850, was toward the collection of natural-history specimens for the purposes of study. With the approval of Secretary Henry, he put into operation plans for the accomplishment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yielding regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations were spent in field researches. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other branches of

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. fi
the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson Bay Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company were enlisted in the cause and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by these beginnings has been lasting and widespread, as shown in the extensive natural history operations. of subsequent national and State surveys, the organization of the United States Fish Commission, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other bureaus of the Government.
Having as its first purpose the promotion of scientific research, next accepting the custody of the Government and other collections, and finally developing broadly along educational lines, the history of the National Museum may, as the late Doctor Goode has pointed out, be divided into three epochs, which he describes as follows:
First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except as afoundation for scientific description and theory. ‘
Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the custody of the ** National Cabinet of Curiosities,’’ to 1876. During this period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve an educational purpose.
Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.
During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum endeavors to promote them all.
It is @ museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the typesof numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for the reports upon the resources of the United States.
It isa museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.
It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named series of duplicates.
In these words the objects of the Museum are so clearly defined and the plan laid down is so broad that those who come after have but to perfect the details while preserving that unity of interests which is requisite if the structure as a whole shall forever prove worthy of its founders and of this great nation.

<<<Page: 31>>>

In its capacity of a museum of record, the growth of the National Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration and development of a rich and extensive country, under the liberal and progressive policy of the Government, whose inquiries into new regions and into new fields have been pushed without stint. Scientific institutions everywhere, foreign governments and individuals have likewise contributed abundant stores of great value, and a small fund in recent years has permitted of some purchases to supply desiderata. The richness of the collections has also been much increased through the exchange of duplicate specimens with other similar establishments.
The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized as follows:
1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in connection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.
2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842, the North Pacific or Perry Exploring Expedition from 1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and including the recent operations in West Indian and Philippine waters.
3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and consular service abroad.
4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad survey, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the United States Army; and the activities of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army stationed in remote regions.
5. The explorations of the United States Geological Survey, the United States Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches of the Government.
6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several expositions at homeand abroad in which the Museum or Fish Commission have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, the international fisheries exhibitions at Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, and at Omaha in 1898. The returns from the Philadelphia Exhibition

<<<Page: 32>>>

were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal and mineral resources, the fisheries and the ethnology of the native races of the country, valuable gifts from the thirty foreign governments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Eurove and America. 7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums.
Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building, the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the new building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large accessions received from Philadelphia, and from other sources, the number had grown to 1,471,000. It has gone on steadily increasing every year, and now, at the close of 1900, the number of specimens is in excess of 4,800,000.
While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collections, when it is considered that in 1883 all of the space in both buildings was completely filled, and in fact was so overcrowded that a third building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the specimens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe structures where they are mainly piled up in the original packing boxes, and where has already accumulated much more than enough material of great intrinsic and scientific value to fill a larger building than that now occupied by the main collections.
In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, as they are called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete in all the groups as’ the accessions have made possible, is given to all properly qualified persons engaged in original research. Advantage of the opportunity thus afforded is widely availed of, the Museum being visited every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction, coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign countries as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is occasionally sent out to representatives of other

<<<Page: 33>>>

museums or laboratories having the means of providing for its safekeeping, this being done more particularly when they are engaged to work up special subjects or when they desire to use the material for comparison in connection with their own collections.
Being charged primarily with the custodianship of its collections, the members of the scientific staff of the National Museum have comparatively little time during office hours for advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for such work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identify and classify the specimens under their care in accordance with the most advanced researches, The fact, however, that many papers descriptive of the collections are produced each year is indicative of the industry which prevails among the staff and of the extent to which the hours of work are prolonged.
Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to conduct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose results the Museum shares.
Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work carried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased.
Though having little means to expend for field work, members of the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate in the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expeditions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on, though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new and valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it occurred,
The educational side of the Museum consists in the main of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so labeled that the public may be instructed as by an encyclopedia cut apart and spread out, except that its illustrations are real and material things. Conceding all the space required, the principal difficulty incident to the proper installation of such a collection is in the selection of its parts so that while visitors may have placed before them all that is genuinely essential, they shall not be overburdened or confused with details. With the advance in museum methods, moreover, the objects on display are being grouped to a greater and greater extent, to show relationships, with, whenever possible, some added notion of their natural environment, so that at a glance the visitor may better

comprehend their true character and significance. In this direction the National Museum has been making conspicuous progress, and probably now takes the lead.
‘No museum administrator had a better understanding of the public needs than the late Doctor Goode, and none labored more earnestly and conscientiously than he to make this a museum for, as well as of, the people. His assistants were relied upon to arrange and maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, but the interests of the public were retained in his own immediate charge. His mind was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of nature and the thoughts and activities of mankind that the visitor, by the very force of his surroundings, was bound to receive and carry with him some definite impression, some new bit of knowledge.
Doctor Goode’s labors in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official connection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quarter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums of Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities for observation and experiment. Thougha young man when he died, none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy of being followed.
In this, as in every other activity of a live organization, change and improvement are constant. The receipt of new material will, it is to be expected, continue unceasingly, and every year something must arrive in which the public has a.right to share. During the past five years the progress made in the installation of the exhibition series has been especially noteworthy, and now for the first time every hall designed for public use is permanently opened, though not one is above addition or improvement, and in some the arrangement is entirely provisional.
An incidental, though very popular, educational feature of the Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and colleges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources of the Museum would admit of, as it requires the working over of entire collections before the reserve and duplicate series can be separated, and the labeling and packing take much time. Many hundreds of these sets have been given away, but none have been prepared recently, and the few remaining on hand at the beginning of the year have now been disposed of.
Searcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through this means its existence and aims are being brought constantly and

<<<Page: 35>>>

prominently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one another so closely and have required so extensive preparation as to interfere greatly with the legitimate work of the Museum, but the practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one, insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washington, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating the growth of museums in many quarters.
The publications of the Museum may be classed, at least in a general way, as belonging to its educational side, though they are mainly technical, and in that respect most useful to the investigator. They spread the work of the Museum abroad and make known the nature and extent of its collections. The Annual Report was first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report in 1884, and has just reached its seventeenth volume. Besides the administrative part, it has consisted mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of the collection. Of the Proceedings, made up of technical papers of small to moderate size, twenty-one volumes have been issued and another is in press. The Bulletins, reserved chiefly for the larger and more exhaustive scientific papers, number forty-nine, of which the last one printed (Bulletin 47), a monograph of the fishes of North and Middle © America, is in four parts, completed near the close of the year.
By 1883, only two years after possession had been taken of the present Museum building, its capacity was found to be wholly insufficient, and an estimate for a second structure of even larger size was at once submitted to Congress. In his report for 1884, Doctor Goode explained that it was a serious problem where to store the incoming collections, leaving entirely out of consideration the question of their display. The needs in this direction, always increasing, have been urged in every subsequent report, but so far without effective result. The Senate voted $500,000 for a new building in 1888, and again in 1890, 1892, and 1896, but all these measures failed of action in the House.
The Museum has now reached a crisis in its history which must be frankly met. It can no longer comply with the mandates of Congress imposed upon it by the act of 1846 establishing the Smithsonian Institution. The two buildings which it occupies are overcrowded to the extent that the collections they contain can only in part be arranged and classified so as to permit of their examination as required by law, and many of the collections are so inaccessible as to endanger their very safety. Many hundreds of boxes, to a large extent turned over by the Government surveys and filled with material valued at

<<<Page: 36>>>

hundreds of thousands of dollars, are stacked wp in frame and cheaply constructed brick buildings, liable at any time to destruction by fire. There is no place where this material, composing fully one-half of the Museum’s possessions, can be unpacked and spread out for study or reference, while the portion suitable for exhibition would alone more than fill another structure as large as the present Museum building.
For the existence of this condition neither the National Museum nor the Smithsonian Institution can be held responsible. The Institution was made the custodian of all collections belonging to the Government in the Congressional act providing for and thus preceding its organization. It has fulfilled the obligation conscientiously and in accordance with the spirit of the law, even when its own funds have had to be drawn upon. It has shown that the trust was not misplaced, and in the face of obstacles which have at times seemed insurmountable has given its museum feature a standing not excelled in any country in the world, though in accommodations and display its position is decidedly inferior to many.
A national museum is not of the nature of a project which may await the pleasure of summary action. Its material accumulates with the exploration and development of the country—in the case of the United States mainly through Congressional direction—and if the material collected by this means be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, the most of it can only be replaced, if at all, at greatly increased cost. For many years this country has been supporting extensive investigations under authority of Congress. Prominent among: the bureaus whose work requires the collecting of specimens and their transfer to Washington for purposes of study are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Biological Survey and the divisions of Entomology and Botany of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology. <A large amount of material has reached Washington in the past, and will certainly continue to do so, from other Government sources, such as Army and Navy expeditions, representatives abroad of the Department of State, the RevenueMarine Service, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. These bureaus depend by law upon the National Museum for the care of their collections. Having for the most part very inadequate accommodations in their own buildings, much of their material is turned over as soon as received in Washington, and thus the Museum is called upon, very appropriately, to make greater provision for the handling and storing of specimens than is generally supposed. This unworked material has, in one sense, even greater value than that which has been determined and described, as its study is expected to develop facts yet undiscovered, and the responsibility for its safe-keeping is increased accordingly.
The demand for additional space and for new cases, always incessant,

<<<Page: 37>>>

has reached a stage where the helplessness of the authorities to meet it is pathetic. Galleries have been built in some of the Museum halls. Their capacity has not sufficed to keep pace with the current demands of the years in which they were constructed, and collection after collection has been carted away to one of the outside buildings. These now are all practically filled, and next year a new one must be leased, or accessions turned away, or the exhibition halls transformed into storehouses.
On its educational side there is equal cause for complaint. The public demands to see more than is now placed before it, and what is already on display is so closely crowded as to be difficult of inspection. As previously explained, there is much material in storage which should be put on exhibition. In fact, a very large share of the collections can be best looked after and protected in the exposed cases of the open halls. With its great resources, exceeding those of any State, municipal, or private establishment, the Government is under a moral obligation to foster and promote the educational feature of the Museum to the fullest extent possible. Congress has acknowledged this obligation from the very start, and has, perhaps, done more in support of this object than of any other. It is the one, moreover, which requires the most space and most expensive furnishings—the largest item in the construction of a new building.
Laboratories of much larger size than the existing ones are required in all the departments. This is not alone in the interest of the work carried on by employees of the Museum. Better accommodations are needed for the assistants from other scientific bureaus who are called here to consult the collections, and who could to some extent carry on their investigations much more advantageously at the Museum than in their own buildings were proper facilities afforded them. The wants of scientific men from other parts of the country and from abroad, who turn to the national collections for materials for their study, and many of whom visit Washington every year, have also to be considered and provided for.
And finally, the shops where cases are made, where paint is stored and mixed, where the taxidermy, modeling, and coarser preparatory work is done, now distributed among as many outside buildings, require to be brought together in the interest of economy and of better administration.
As a result of its extraordinary growth under the very inadequate provisions made for its maintenance, the National Museum has been obliged to adapt itself to circumstances, to scatter its belongings and its work, so that to-day its form and its administration are conditioned by the restrictions under which it labors and not in accordance with the best ideals, in the realization of many of which it was originally a pioneer. The first and most urgent need is a new building, large,

<<<Page: 38>>>

dignified, and accessible, with extensive halls and ample accommodations for its collections and activities. Such a house provided, it may take its proper place among the great museums of the world. The interests of the Government and of research will be promoted, the public will secure its proper measure of advantages, educational establishments throughout the country will be benefited, and a museum worthy of the generous people all over the United States who have lavished gifts upon it, of the patient toil of the many scientific men who have given it the best years of their lives, often without hope of reward, and of this great, prosperous, and enlightened nation will grace the national capital.
The additions to the collections in the various departments aggregated considerably over 200,000 objects. The most important accession was the so-called Marsh collection of fossil vertebrates received from the United States Geological Survey. Its contents can not as yet be fully determined, as the matrix still hides many of the specimens, but the latter range from small teeth to more or less perfect skeletons weighing from 500 to 2,000 pounds apiece. The total weight of the collection is over 80 tons, and its value, at a rough estimate, has been placed at not less than $150,000. Another noteworthy acquisition by the Department of Geology was the collection of minerals belonging to the late Prof. C. U. Shepard, consisting of over 5,000 specimens, among which are many rareties and much of historical value, including a large number of Professor Shepard’s types. The meteorite collection, which has been increased to 742 specimens, now ranks among the largest in the world, while in the field of paleobotany the National Museum has become the center of systematic work.
Dr. William L. Abbott, in continuation of many past favors, has contributed nearly 1,200 specimens of mammals, birds, and batrachians, besides a large quantity of material in other groups, the results of his explorations among the islands of the China Sea, and in Trong, Lower Siam, and Singapore. Other large and valuable additions have been the birds, mollusks, insects, and plants of the E. H. Harriman Alaskan Expedition; the unique collection of spiders belonging to the late Dr. George Marx; many birds from Hawaii and Colombia; large numbers of bats from the West Indian region; and fishes from both sides of the Pacific Ocean.
The additions to the herbarium numbered over 27,000 specimens, mainly from the Southern and Western States, Alaska, Mexico, and Europe.
In anthropology over 33,716 objects were received, among them many of great scientific and historical value. A large number of these

<<<Page: 39>>>

were obtained through the instrumentality of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
Following are some of the more important changes in connection with the exhibition series: The gallery in the northeast court has been newly furnished with ebonized cases of elegant design, in which the collection of ceramics, together with other works in glass, lacquer, and metal, has been installed with very effective results. The Indian basketry collection, one of the finest now in existence, has been arranged, with the ethnological exhibits from Latin America, in the corresponding gallery of the northwest court. The display in the hall containing the Catlin paintings and the Indian groups has been as nearly completed as the material on hand permits, while the medical exhibit has been entirely revised, and many additions and readjustments have been made in the Hall of History.
The south or Mammal Hall has been partly refitted with large cases, and its contents rearranged, the American species being retained on the floor, while those from other countries have been transferred to the new gallery above. In this hall are displayed, in several groups, some of the finest examples of taxidermic work ever produced. The floor space of the south east range has been entirely given over to the exhibition of fishes, reptiles, and batrachians, and the reorganization of the bird collection in the Smithsonian building, chiefly through a reduction in the number of specimens displayed, has been nearly finished. The lighting by electricity of the cases in the central quadrangle of the latter hall, containing bright-plumaged birds, has resulted satisfactorily, bringing into use what has practically been a large waste space.
The systematic exhibition series in practical geology, occupying the gallery of the southwest court, has been essentially completed. Important changes have been made in the collections illustrating the building stones and mineral resources of the United States, and good progress is to be noted in the installation of invertebrate fossils. Several striking special exhibits of geological structure and phenomena have also been added.
The total number of persons who visited the exhibition halls during
the year was 225,440 for the Museum building and 133,147 for the Smithsonian building, an average daily attendance of 720 at the former and of 425 at the latter.
The principal researches completed, or in which marked progress was made during the year by assistants of the Museum, have related to mammals, birds, insects, mollusks, crustaceans, plants, and certain branches of ethnology and geology. Reference should especially be made to a monograph by Mr. Robert Ridgway on the Birds of North and Middle America, on which he has been engaged for several years. The first volume is nearly ready for printing, and several additional

<<<Page: 40>>>

volumes will be required to complete the work. Specimens in greater or less number have been sent for study to the representatives of over twenty prominent museums and universities in different parts of the United States.
More of the Museum staff than usual were in the field, the duration of their absence from Washington varying from two or three weeks to as many months. Mr. William H. Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and Mr. F. V. Coville accompanied the Harriman Alaskan Expedition. Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Charles W. Richmond, Mr. William Palmer, and Mr. J. H. Riley visited Cuba and Porto Rico in the interest of the Pan-American Exposition. The whale fishery of Newfoundland was investigated by Dr. Frederick W. True, and the anthropology of Cuba and Jamaica by Mr. William H. Holmes. Collections of plants were made in Mexico by Dr. J. N. Rose and Dr. Walter Hough; of vertebrates in Venezuela by Mr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr.; of fishes in the Vineyard Sound region of Massachusetts by Mr. Barton A. Bean, and of fossils in Wyoming by Mr. Charles Schuchert and Dr. Lester F. Ward.
From the appropriation of $300,000 made by Congress for the Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 $50,000 have been allotted to the use of the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus. Before the close of the year the plans for the display by the Museum had been practically settled, and considerable progress had been made in bringing the necessary collections together and in starting the work of preparing them.

By Wiuuiam H. Homes, Head Curator.
The organization of the department has remained practically unchanged during the year.
Owing to the lack of space in the exhibition halls, the Division of Somatology and several sections are not represented in the exhibition series, and numerous other branches are but meagerly shown.
The only change made in the personnel of the anthropological staff was the assignment of Mr. Paul Beckwith, of the clerical force, to the duties of aid in the Division of History and Biography. Mr. Beckwith’s services are also utilized in the Section of Coins and Medals.
The death of Mr. A. Zeno Shindler, a preparator in the department, occurred during the year. Mr. Shindler had been attached to the Smithsonian Institution and Museum for twenty-five years or more, doing excellent service as a painter of ethnological portraits and in coloring casts in the Department of Biology as well as that of Anthropology.
During previous years the offices occupied by members of the staff of the department were much scattered and, in the main, not conveniently situated with respect to the exhibition halls. Recently, however, the roomy west portal of the Museum building has been remodeled as an office for the head curator, while the adjoining rooms on the north and south have been fitted up as department laboratories and utilized largely for receiving and distributing collections. The office of the curator of the Division of Ethnology connects with this suite on the south, and the department recorder occupies a room on the north. On the floor above are five small rooms, occupied by assistant curators, aids, and preparators. Rooms requiring it have been connected by means of speaking tubes, and a telephone has been introduced into one of the laboratories, greatly facilitating the transaction of business. All of these rooms have been renovated and repaired during the year. The several honorary members of the staff occupy,

<<<Page: 45>>>

of necessity, offices at points convenient to the work in which they are primarily engaged. A sectional library has been established in the office of the head curator, which is intended to be supplied with such general reference works as may not be available for the several divisions and sections.
Little progress was made during the year in the direction of increased or improved facilities for installation. The handsome ehonized wall case, 64 feet in length and 9 feet in height, built in the gallery of the northeast court during the previous year, has been fitted up with shelving, and the ceramic collections, together with numerous works in glass, lacquer, and metal, have been installed in it. This case, built by the Museum mechanics, is probably not surpassed anywhere for beauty, convenience, and mechanical perfection. Much attention has been given to the reassemblage and fitting up of cases already in use, and the furniture of the department presents a much more creditable appearance than at any previous period.
Accessions to the collections of the department have been of average number and importance. The following statistical statement gives the accessions by divisions and sections:

During the past year, and during the two preceding years as well, there was a constant shifting and reshifting of the collections, resulting _ from reclassification and the demand of additional material for installation. Instructive and valuable specimens have been selected and placed on exhibition and less important material has been placed in

<<<Page: 48>>>

storage. The effort has been to constantly improve the condition and enhance the usefulness of the collections. The task of destroying moths and other injurious insects has been faithfully performed by Mr. Joseph Palmer, preparator, who is able to report the rare occurrence of these pests among the collections of the department. The work of poisoning is begun at once upon the arrival of specimens and is generally completed before assignment is made to the divisions and sections. The extensive basketry collection has been thoroughly cleaned and treated with preservatives, and other articles requiring it have been treated in like manner. Poisoned specimens are specially tagged or marked, and a card catalogue recording dates and kind of treatment is kept. STORAGE.
A great body of material belonging to the collection is in storage in the Smithsonian Institution, in the Museum, and in three outbuildings. During the year the head curator undertook the task of examining all of this storage material, the object being to determine its nature and availability for exhibition. He was made chairman of a committee by the executive curator and was instructed to investigate the entire storage material of the Museum. A force of from six to ten men was employed for six weeks in this work. The storage material has been accumulating for twenty-five years without full separation of the various classes of collections and with but meager records. The multitude of crates, boxes, and uncased objects was gotten out and classified. The anthropological property was segregated by divisions and sections, and a card catalogue was made enumerating briefly the contents of each package. The same information was placed upon the packages which are so arranged that the labels are visible and so they can be removed with a minimum of labor. Up to date the catalogue contains 711 cards. In addition, there is a large body of collections mounted in glass covered unit boxes for exposition use. This mateyial is now stacked in the storage buildings.
The routine for the reception, distribution, and cataloguing of collections is given in last year’s report. The work of the head curator’s office and of each division and section has been conducted according to the plan laid down in that report, and the results seem to be entirely satisfactory. In writing the present report the head curator has assembled on his desk the following data: The department’s books recording accessions, permanent and temporary, for the year; the card catalogue of accessions; the card catalogue of collections for the year from all the divisions and sections; the card catalogue of storage; the card catalogue of exchanges; the card catalogue of articles poisoned

<<<Page: 49>>>

or otherwise treated, and a card catalogue of articles, such as models and casts, made for the Museum by preparators or other persons employed by the Museum. At the same time a detailed report of the operations of each division and section for the year is in the hands of the head curator, who is able, through these various sources of information, to understand and summarize the work of the year with much ease and satisfaction.
The year has witnessed very decided progress in the work of installation, the divisions of Ethnology, Technology, History, and Medicine, and the sections of Graphic Arts and Ceramics having made most gratifying headway. Prof. O. T. Mason reports, for the Division of Ethnology, that the cases in the west north range are so fully installed and labeled that this room may be considered to fall little short of completion. During the year the force of the division has been partly engaged in installing collections in the gallery of the northwest court. On the east side of this gallery there are cases containing typical exhibits of basketry from all parts of the world. On the north side the series of rail cases shows the types of California basketry, while in the wall cases a series of baskets is shown representing various tribes from British Columbia to Mexico. On the south and west sides of this gallery are exhibits of ethnological materials of Latin America, beginning with Sonora on the north and ending with Tierra del Fuego on the south.
The honorary curator of the Division of Mechanical Technology, Dr. J. E. Watkins, reports that important improvements in the installation of the Section of Land Transportation have been made. The base and iron rail of the locomotive ‘‘ John Bull” have been completed. The ox cart from New Mexico and the Red River cart have been placed on a new mahogany base and installed with other wheeled vehicles. The large wooden models of the locomotives ‘*Tom Thumb” and ‘** Arabian” have been removed to storage, and small models are being made to take their place in the exhibit. The original driving wheels of the locomotives ‘‘ John Bull” and ‘‘ De Witt Clinton” and several other antique car wheels have been permanently installed on the piers within the hall. The boiler of the locomotive ‘* Stourbridge Lion” has been fitted with wooden axles and mounted on its wheels. It is hoped that additional parts of this locomotive may be secured, so that it may, in time, be restored to approximately its original condition.
The curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, Dr. Thomas _ Wilson, mentions in his report the very obvious fact that the exhibi, tion cases of the division are overcrowded. With every accession of importance he is compelled to condense the exhibits in order to make

<<<Page: 50>>>

room. During the year the work of segregating various exhibition units has been continued, but it is not deemed advisable to begin the radical change of installation so manifestly called for until extensive improvements are made in the hall.
Mr. A. H. Clark, honorary custodian of the Section of American History, states that very satisfactory progress has been made in the care of the collections of that section. Additional cases have been introduced into the north hall and the rotunda, and various rearrangements of cases and exhibits have been made. The contents of many cases have been reclassified and installation has been perfected. The superb collection of personal relics of Admiral George Dewey, deposited during the year, has been installed in cases near the Museum entrance. During the year it has been necessary to send numerous exhibits to storage. Increased exhibition room for this section is very much needed.
A complete reinstallation of the exhibits included in the Division of Medicine has been made during the year by the honorary curator, Medical Director J. M. Flint, United States Navy. The cases have been arranged in alcove style, thus giving a passageway of proper width along the gallery. Included with the collections of this division are two cases containing exhibits designed to illustrate the composition of the human body.
Noteworthy improvements have been made in the installation of the Section of Graphic Arts. Mr. Paul Brockett has conducted this work under the immediate supervision of the head curator. Two cases have been added, one containing series of exhibits illustrating the history of the book, and the other, examples of modern binding; the latter exhibit is lent by Miss E. R. Scidmore.
The Section of Ceramics has been assigned to the northeast court gallery, which has been fitted up with excellent cases. Early in the year the collections of ceramics, glass, lacquer, bronze, etc., were installed here by the head curator, the arrangement being primarily by countries and secondarily by varieties or factories.
The important work of labeling the collections of the department is progressing satisfactorily. The system of case labeling adopted during the preceding year, and described in the report for that year, has been successfully applied, and many labels are already in place. The printing of labels for several halls is now going forward, and minor labels have been prepared in large numbers by the various curators. As soon as the work of labeling is reasonably complete and the installation satisfactory, it is planned to prepare a key or guide to the collections of the department.

<<<Page: 51>>>

The department has not been able to carry on extensive field work during the year. The explorations of Dr. Walter Hough, made in connection with an expedition conducted by Dr. J. }., Rose, of the Division of Botany, were mentioned in the report of last year, although not completed until August of the present year. The collections made are of very considerable scientific value, including, as they do, many plants used in the native arts, ancient and modern, besides numerous specimens of native handiwork. During the year Mr. C. H. Townsend returned from his voyage on the A/batross, bringing a large collection of ethnological specimens from the Pacific islands, and Dr. W. H. Abbott, continuing his explorations in the Malay Archipelago, has forwarded many objects of interest. Col. H. H. Hilder, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has visited the Philippines, collecting for the Pan-American Exposition, and reports the shipment of much material that will finally enrich the Museum. Maj. J. W. Powell and Mr. W. H. Holmes spent three months in Cuba and Jamaica, securing valuable collections of relics illustrating the ancient peoples of these islands.
The curators of the department have found time, aside from their duties as custodians of the collections, to engage in important researches based largely, as usual, on the national collections. The head curator has continued his studies relating to aboriginal pottery, to the evidences of auriferous gravel man in California, and to antiquities of Mexico. The curator of ethnology has made progress toward completing his monograph on American aboriginal zootechny, and has made a careful study of the recently received Hudson collection of California basketry. The assistant curator of ethnology has continued his studies in heating and illumination, and has prepared a manuscript on the primitive stages of illumination, covering the use of the torch and the candle. He has also pointed out the connection between Mexico and the Philippines with relation to the introduction of plants and industries from Mexico to the Philippines and from the Philippines to Mexico.
The curator of prehistoric archeology has made further progress in his studies relating to primitive trepannation, working experimentally with primitive utensils upon various specimens of human crania. He has also been interested in the discovery of the truth with respect to allegations that prehistoric man was ambidextrous, studying the statistics furnished by our Indian schools and the rich collections of his division.
The curator of the Division of Religions has completed an illustrated catalogue of the Benguiat collection of Jewish ceremonial objects.

<<<Page: 52>>>

oo Ve
The curator of the Division of Mechanical Technology has been prosecuting researches in various sections of this division, and Mr. G. C. Maynard, aid, continues his studies with respect to the electrical collections.
The extensive collections of the department naturally form the basis of study in many branches of research. Students are made welcome at all times, and not a few have availed themselves of the facilities offered. Mr. Foster Jennings, Rev. Dr. W. E. Griffis, Mr. W. H. Patton, Mr. J. D. McGuire, and Mr. E. Quesada have pursued investigations in the Divisions of Ethnology and Somatology. Mr. Frank Calvert, Prof. F. B. Tarbell, and Mr. Willard Nye, jr., have consulted the collections in prehistoric archeology, and Mr. Franklin W. Smith and the Association for the Study of Comparative Religions have pursued investigations in the Division of Religions. Scientific and numerous nonscientific writers engaged in the preparation of matter for periodicals and newspapers have found the department a profitable field.
It is not usual to lend collections to students desiring to study them outside of the Museum, save in cases where loss or injury is not imminent. In several instances, however, articles have been turned over to the Bureau of American Ethnology, and a few loans have been made to museums. A collection of Shoshone and Ute crania was forwarded to the American Museum of Natural History at the request of Prof. F. W. Putnam. These were studied by Dr. A. Hrdlicka, and returned in good order. A number of games have also been loaned to the museum of the University of Pennsylvania for the use of Mr. Stewart Culin. Numerous model. belonging to the Section of Transportation were loaned to the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, Pa., in order that copies of them might be made for that institution. A collection of electrical apparatus numbering 56 specimens was loaned to the American Commissioner-General for the Paris Exposition.

By Freperick W. TRUE,
Head Curator.
The past year has been one of unusual activity in several of the divisions, and a number of important advances have been made. It has been marked also by the beginning of preparations for the PanAmerican Exposition, which opens at Buffalo, N. Y., in May, 1901.
In the Division of Mammals a plan for improving the housing of the exhibition series, worked out last year, was carried into effect. A large case, 91 feet long and 9 feet deep, was built along the east wall of the south hall, and in it were placed all the North American carnivores. This allowed the removal of the unsightly temporary case containing the seals from the center of the hall, and the placing of the groups of bison and moose, the finest zoological groups the Museum possesses, in a better light. The present arrangement of cases is shown on the following page.
The large cast and skeleton of a humpback whale, which was for many years suspended from the roof in this hall, was removed to the adjoining osteological hall, replacing a skeleton of the same species formerly exhibited there. This change has improved the lighting in the south hall, as the cast formerly obstructed the light from the main south window.
An important change was, after full consideration, made in the south east range, occupied last year jointly by the exhibits of reptiles and of fishes and a part of the mammal collections of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture. The range was completely floored over at the level of the gallery, dividing the hall into an upper and lower story. The mammal collections referred to were transferred to the upper story, leaving the ground floor entirely free for exhibition purposes, a decided advantage both as to increase of space and improvement of appearance.

As the old wooden floor could not be replaced at once by a stone pavement, it was thought best not to attempt a rearrangement and extension of the exhibition series of reptiles, batrachians, and fishes
until next year. N.

No important change has taken place in the Hall of Comparative Anatomy, but the introduction of skylights in the roof of this hall has increased the amount of light.

<<<Page: 56>>>

The flooring over of the south east range, already mentioned, made it possible to extend the laboratory of the Division of Plants. New dusttight cases were built for the herbarium and placed in the second story of the range, which they occupy jointly with the mammal collections of the Department of Agriculture. A row of skylights in the roof over these cases gives abundance of light.
The work of reorganizing the exhibition series of birds in the main hall of the Smithsonian building, which was begun last year, has been completed, except in so far as regards labeling. The old wooden floor in this hall was replaced by one of stone and cement (terrazzo) at the beginning of the year and a plan was adopted for lighting the center of the hall, formerly almost totally dark, by artificial means. New cases with large glass were provided for the four spaces about the entrance, styled ‘* the quadrangle,” and in them have been placed special exhibits of birds of more than ordinary interest, such as the birds of paradise, parrots, hornbills, etc. The cases are lighted by incandescent electric lamps, provided with hoods and reflectors. The result of these changes is that this section of the hall, formerly unfit for exhibition -purposes, is now one of the most attractive points in the building. The reduction in the number of birds exhibited has relieved the congested condition of the cases, and makes it possible to view each specimen satisfactorily. The cases themselves are old and not as free from dust as could be wished, but otherwise the improvement effected may be considered to have amply repaid the labor involved. A considerable amount of relabeling remains to be done, and better provision made for the bird groups and the collections of eggs and nests.
A series of enlarged illustrations of Rotifers was added to the new exhibition series of lower invertebrates during the year. In the North American series the groups remaining to be represented are the parasitic and nonparasitic worms and the polyzoa and certain of the crustacea.
No opportunity was found during the year to reorganize the exhibits of insects and of plants, and no important changes were made in the exhibition series of mollusks. The osteological exhibit, as stated in a previous report, is as full as can be accommodated in the present quarters.
The extensive collecting operations of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who generously donates the fruit of his labors to the Museum, continued during the year.
The activities of the scientific bureaus of the Government, involving the acquisition of natural history specimens, vary from year to year. During the past vear, as in many years preceding, the operations of the United States Fish Commission resulted in Jarge additions to the Museum.

A new source of increment has been found in the willingness of observers of the Weather Bureau, especially those in the West Indies, to collect material desired by the Museum.
Purchases were more frequent during the past year than formerly, and the success in filling important gaps in various series was most gratifying. Indeed, the zoological collections have reached the stage where means to supply definite deficiencies by expenditure of money isa matter of the greatest importance. Not less important, and promoting the same end, is the employment of trained collectors to visit localities selected for specific reasons. During the past year several such. opportunities were taken advantage of with most beneficial results.
While the Museum has never been in a position financially to maintain extensive field operations, members of the scientific staff have nearly every year made collections of more or less magnitude. Several such enterprises were entered into last year. In addition, opportunities occur, from time to time, to accompany field parties under private auspices. Several members of the scientific staff joined the Harriman Alaska Expedition by invitation of Mr. Edw. H. Harriman. At the close of the year, Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was detailed to accompany Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U. 8. A., to Venezuela.
During the summer of 1899 Messrs. J. N. Rose and Walter Hough were engaged for three months in a botanical expedition in central and southern Mexico. They visited numerous places where collections bad been made previously, and obtained many plants from type localities, not a few of which were not represented in the herbarium, besides numerous undescribed species.
Mr. B. A. Bean pursued ichthyological investigations for the Museum in Edgartown Harbor, Massachusetts, and obtained an excellent series of fishes for the collection.
The head curator spent some weeks, by the favor of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, at their station in Newfoundland, where he had admirable opportunities to study fresh examples of finback and humpback whales.
The accessions of the year compare favorably in scientific importance with those of preceding years, but were somewhat less numerous than in 1898-99.
Accessions to the collections are received from a great variety of sources, among which the donations of numerous friends and correspondents of the Smithsonian Institution are conspicuous.
Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose name is associated in these reports with so many valuable donations, presented large zoological collections during the year from the islands of the China Sea, from Trong, Lower Siam, and Singapore. These collections comprised no iess than 257

<<<Page: 58>>>

mammals, 763 birds, and 125 batrachians, together with insects and other invertebrates. They are of great interest to the Museum, since they contain many species new to science, as well as a variety of others previously unrepresented here. Their value for scientific purposes is much enhanced by the accurate and thorough manner in which they are labeled by Dr. Abbott.
While with the Harriman Alaska expedition Mr. Ridgway obtained over 300 birds and Mr. Dall collected a considerable number of interesting mollusks. The collection of insects presented by Mr. Harriman numbers over 4,000 specimens, and is probably the largest and most complete collection of Alaska insects ever brought together. It contains many new forms and a large series of species from boreal America not previously represented in the Museum. The collecting
as done by Mr. Trevor Kincaid, of the University of Washington.
Sir Charles Eliot, British Samoan commissioner, presented to the Museum an excellent series of shells and naked mollusks, and a large number of other invertebrates, which he collected in Samoa.
The zoological collectors sent out by the Institution in the interest of the Pan-American Exposition to Cuba and Porto Rico obtained a large amount of interesting material. Doctors Stejneger and Richmond collected 250 birds, 549 reptiles and batrachians, 126 bats, and a quantity of insects, crustaceans, earthworms, and other specimens. Messrs. J. H. Riley and William Palmer in Cuba, at the close of the year, had collected 509 bats, 298 birds, 209 reptiles and batrachians, a large number of fishes, more than 1,700 insects, besides other invertebrates, and plants and specimens of other kinds.
The most important purchase of the year was the Goodfellow collection of humming birds, comprising about 1,200 specimens. Many species are represented by series of from 10 to 20 skins. The skins
are admirably prepared and very fully labeled. A large number of
the species was previously unrepresented in the collection.
Another purchase of importance was the Marx collection of spiders, containing several thousand syecimens, chiefly North American, and including numerous types and co-types of described species.
An especially noteworthy specimen obtained this vear was the skeleton of the recently-discovered Marsupial Mole, Votoryctes, which was received in exchange from the University College, Dundee.
Endeavors to add to the Museum collection of bats have been very successful. Mr. Ernest T. Giers presented 88 specimens from the island of Trinidad. Lieut. J. W. Daniel, jr., presented 46 specimens from Cuba; 196 specimens from Curacao were purchased from Mr. Leon J. Guthrie. Mr. P. McDonough presented 29 specimens from the Barbados, and Mr. L. M. McCormick presented 17 specimens from the Philippine Islands. In addition, the collectors for the PanAmerican Exposition (as above stated) obtained 126 specimens in Porto
Rico and 509 in Cuba. Altogether, therefore, over 1,000 specimens
of bats have been added during the year.

<<<Page: 59>>>

Two collections of European mammals, comprising 185 specimens, were purchased. The proprietors of Forepaugh and Sells Brothers’ shows presented an African rhinoceros which died in their menagerie.
Skeletons of the aye-aye, potto, and a porpoise (Veomer?s) were purchased, and skeletons of a guanaco and a spotted hyena were obtained from the National Zoological Park.
Among birds a very interesting addition was the skeleton of Harris’s cormorant, receivedin exchange from Leland Stanford Junior University. It is at present the only known skeleton of this rare species. A valuable collection of Hawaiian birds, containing about 500 specimens, was purchased from Mr. H. W. Henshaw. Mr. Outram Bangs presented a collection of about 300 Colombian and Panama birds. From Maj. W. A. Glassford, U. S. A., was received a specimen of the Cuban Macaw (Ara tricolor), which is now believed to be extinct. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. A., presented a number of reptiles which he collected in Texas.
An excellent collection of Japanese fishes, including the types of 14 new forms, was presented by the Leland Stanford Junior University, through Dr. David S$. Jordan. These were supplemented by collections from the same region transmitted by the Fish Commission, together with Alaskan, Hawaiian, and Californian fishes. A collection of fishes of the Red Sea, in an especially fine state of preservation, and also fishes of the Mediterranean, were obtained from the Museo Civico, Milan, Italy. New Zealand fishes were obtained from the Public Museum at Wanganui.
Mr. Barton A. Bean made a collection of fishes in the vicinity of Woods Hole, Mass., in which were included the young of a number of southern forms not previously found so far north.
Among mollusks the most interesting addition was a fine collection of some 800 specimens of South Australian shells received in exchange from Walter D. Reed, esq., of Adelaide. A small series of rare shells was received from the Bishop Memorial Museum, Honolulu, and Mr. Dall also presented specimens collected by himself in the Hawaiian Islands.
A valuable series of land shells from the Galapagos Islands was received from the Leland Stanford Junior University, and the Museum series is now probably unsurpassed. Rare land shells from the Hawaiian Islands were presented by Mrs. Henrietta D. Walcott, of Dedham, Mass. Mr. B. H. Wright, of Penn Yan, N. Y., continued his generous donations of type specimens of river mussels (Naiades) from the South and West.
Many fine shells have been added to the Pacific coast series by correspondents in California, among whom should be mentioned Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd, Prof. F. W. Kelsey, and Hon. Delos Arnold.

<<<Page: 60>>>

The additions to the collections of insects and arachnida and myriapoda were very extensive, numbering no less than 85,000 specimens.
‘Mention has already been made of the Marx collection of spiders and of Dr. Abbott’s donations. Mr. Hugo Soltau presented a large collection of coleoptera. Mr. EK. A. Schwarz continued to make important additions to the Hubbard and Schwarz collection. Large numbers of insects were received from the New Mexico Agricultural College, through Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, including many types and co-types of species described by Professor Cockerell. Prof. John B. Smith presented types of various species of Noctuid described by him. Collections of Mexican hymenoptera and South American lepidoptera were purchased. Co-types of species described by Doctor Horn were received from the California Academy of Sciences.
The Department of Agriculture transmitted a collection of insects from Porto Rico collected by Mr. August Busck.
A large collection of crustaceans from the coast of Brazil, obtained by the Branner-Agassiz Expedition of 1899, was presented by Dr. J. C. Branner. Dr. C. H. Eigenmann presented cotypes of an Isopod crustacean from Izel’s Cave, Texas. Dr. C. A. Kofoid presented co-types of a new genus of Volvocide, and Rey. George W. Taylor co-types of two species of British Columbia sponges. Mr. H. W. Henshaw presented a number of crustaceans from the Hawaiian Islands. Crustaceans collected in Texas and Mexico were received from the biological survey of the Department of Agriculture. Corals and crustaceans collected in Porto Rico were received from the United States Fish Commission.
The additions to» the herbarium were very extensive, exceeding 27,000 specimens. Two large donations deserve special mention. Dr. Charles Mohr, of Mobile, Ala., an enthusiastic botanist and collector, presented to the Institution his herbarium of more than 3,000 specimens, chiefly from the southern United States. As the national herbarium was previously deficient in plants from the South, Dr. Mohr’s contribution was especially acceptable. Of similar importance was the donation of the De Chalmot collection of 3,000 plants, from the United States and Europe, by Mrs. Marie De Chalmot, of Holecombs Rock, Va. In the same connection should be mentioned the gift of about 1,100 plants, chiefly from the United States, by Mr. A. H. Curtiss, of Jacksonville, Fla.
Extensive series from Porto Rico, Mexico, the District of Columbia, the Yellowstone National Park, the Pribilof Islands, Canada, Jamaica, and the New England States were purchased, and collections from Montana, Central America, and the Philippine Islands were obtained by exchange.
Dr. J. N. Rose, while pursuing botanical investigations in Mexico, collected some 1,200 specimens for the Museum.

<<<Page: 61>>>

The Department of Agriculture transmitted 2,500 Alaskan plants collected by Mr. F. V. Coville and Mr. T. H. Kearney, 2,300 specimens from Virginia and North Carolina collected by Mr. Kearney, and 807 specimens from the State of Washington collected by Mr. Kirk Whited. The United States Geological Survey transmitted 413 plants from Oregon.
In the Division of Mammals satisfactory progress was made in re-arranging the study collections of rodents, insectivores, and bats, comprising several thousand specimens, and the work of remodeling skins for study purposes was continued for about five months. The majority of these small skins are now in excellent condition. The collection of skins of large mammals is still in confusion owing to lack of proper case room.
The curator of the Division of Birds having been detailed for work on the manuscript of his Manual of the Birds of North and Middle America, and the assistant curator having been in the West Indies for some months, little was accomplished in this division beyond the re-arrangement of the exhibition series, already referred to, and the performance of routine work. The great study collection of birds is, however, in a very satisfactory condition except that portion which is still in old-style cases. Before this can be put in order some eighteen half-unit cases must be provided, for which funds have not been available thus far.
The curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy and assistant were occupied very largely with work on vertebrate fossils, especially’ with the transfer of the Marsh collections from New Haven. ‘This, and the necessity of re-arranging the exhibition hall, left little time for other than routine work. ‘The condition of the vipa collections is satisfactory.
Mr. Dall, honorary curator of the Division of ‘Molluscs reports as follows: :
Progress in the revision of the study series is naturally slow but constant. All the reserve material is accessible and in order. Anything in the collection can be found in a few minutes and the genera are catalogued on cards which refer to their location in the cases. The whole duplicate collection is in first-class order and catalogued on cards. The unadministered alcoholics are catalogued by genera on cards and located so that any jar can be found at once.
In the Division of Marine Invertebrates the study collection of dry specimens of sea urchins was overhauled and arranged systematically for more convenient reference. The collection of worms was transferred to a room in the north tower of the Smithsonian building.
Regarding the study collection of insects, Doctor Howard, honorar y curator, reports as follows:

<<<Page: 62>>>

The collections are in excellent condition, and totally free from museum pests. During April and May all the cabinets and boxes were examined for museum pests, and not a specimen was found infested. It is the first year in the history of the division that such a state of affairs has existed, and this is due principally to the fact that a large percentage of the insects is now permanently arranged in the new standard insect drawers. :
The identification of species and the frequent rearrangement of the different orders still continues. Most of the orders are now arranged more or less satisfactorily, except the exotic material. The exotic material, particularly in the orders Rhynchota, Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, is only partially arranged and identified, and it will take many months, if not two or three years, before all can be satisfactorily arranged and identified.
Doctor Dyar has done much work on the Lepidoptera, Mr. Schwarz on the Coleoptera, Mr. Coquillett on the Diptera, Mr. Ashmead on the Hymenoptera, Mr. Banks on the Arachnida, Mr. Currie on some of the Neuropteroid insects, particularly on the Odonata and Myrmeleonidee, and Mr. Heidemann on some families in the Rhynchota.
The order Orthoptera, especially the exotic material, is almost entirely unarranged.
Reference has already been made to the improvements in the botanical laboratory. The following statement by Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator of the Division of Plants, explains more fully the character and extent of these changes, as well as the progress of routine work during the year:
During the past year the gallery of the south east range has been extended over the center court and about 1,200 square feet have been added to our floor space. This has enabled us to transfer the cases which were temporarily placed on the exhibition gallery to permanent quarters as well as to make room for some new cases. After considerable experimenting a very satisfactory case was planned and eighty new cases have been made and put in place. Each case contains four rows of six pigeonholes, each of the standard size. In addition to the usual doors which fit against felt strips, a second set of doors can be added. These are only to be used during the process of fumigating.
The new cases are stacked in nine double rows, the alternate double rows being two cases high, while the other are one case high. These low cases furnish an abundance of table room either for the distribution of specimens into the cases or as a convenient place for the critical examination of plants. Above these table cases five skylights have just been added, which furnish an abundance of light and suitable ventilation.
During the year the entire collection has been transferred to zinc-lined cases and poisoned with carbon bisulphide. While this work has been done as carefully as possible, yet it requires a great deal of time and is more or less injurious to the plants. In spite of this care, I regret to say, after the specimens are returned to their proper places in the herbarium, the ravages of the insects are still considerable.
Three preparators have been engaged in mounting and labeling specimens during the year. The total number of specimens mounted is 24,049 against 22,559 last year. Nearly all of these have been stamped and incorporated into the general herbarium.
The marking of all accessions with a uniform stamp was begun in 1895, and 76,030 sheets had been stamped at the close of the year coyered by this report.

<<<Page: 63>>>

The present year saw the completion of Jordan and Evermann’s elaborate manual of the Fishes of North and Middle America, which constitutes Bulletin 47 of the National Museum. ‘The companion work on birds by Mr. Robert Ridgway progressed favorably and the manuscript of the first volume was very nearly ready for the printer at the close of the year. The first installment of completed manuscript, about 250 pages, was submitted. A paper on the birds of Trong, Lower Siam, collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott, was begun by Dry. Charles Richmond.
Mr. B. A. Bean engaged in the study of the fishes of New York, Woods Hole, Mass., and the District of Columbia, and also determined the fishes collected by Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia.
A revision of the two great groups of bivalve mollusks, the Tellinid and Cardiide, including their classification and a review of the American species, recent and Tertiary, was completed during the year by Mr. William H. Dall. Over 100 new forms, recent and fossil, were detected and described.
Mr. Simpson completed his revision of the Naiades, or river mussels, a work which represents many years of arduous study, and may be considered the most important contribution to the subject since the appearance of Doctor Lea’s last synopsis. Mr. Paul Bartsch has undertaken and partially completed a revision of the Pyramidellidee of the Pacific coast, a puzzling group of shells requiring much microscopical investigation.
Mr. Richard Rathbun reports as follows regarding the scientific work of the Division of Marine Invertebrates:
The extensive collection of Decapod crustaceans obtained by the United States Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk in Porto Rico in the early part of 1899, were transferred to this division for study. The report on the Anomura has been completed by Doctor Benedict, and that on the Macrura by Miss Rathbun, who has also the portion on the Brachyura well under way. These reports will be published by the Fish Commission.
Doctor Benedict has nearly completed a monograph of, the Galatheidee, to be pub-
lished in the Proceedings. * Some of the Crustacea collected on the Branner-Agassiz expedition to Brazil in 1899, by Dr. J. C. Branner and Mr. A. W. Greeley, have been worked up in this division, the Decapoda and Stomatopoda by Miss Rathbun, the Isopoda by Miss Richardson. Reports on the same are now in press and will appear in the Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences. The Annelida of the same expedition will be studied by Doctor Benedict.
A beginning has been made toward a report on the Decapoda collected from Puget Sound northward to Bering Sea by the Harriman Alaskan expedition, summer of 1899. ‘
Miss Rathbun has completed a report on the Decapod Crustacea of West Africa, which has been published in the Proceedings, and has also made a series of keys to
North American crabs, two of which have already been published in the American Naturalist.

<<<Page: 64>>>

The Decapoda and Isopoda collected on an expedition to the Galapagos Islands in 1898-99, sent out by Stanford University, have been received for study. The Isopoda _haye been written up by Miss Richardson, and the Brachyura and Macrura have been ' determined by Miss Rathbun.
During last summer Miss Rathbun made a study of a certain portion of the freshwater crabs belonging to the Museum of Natural History, Paris.
Miss Richardson has prepared a key to North American Isopoda, which has appeared in two numbers of the American Naturalist; she has also nearly completed an account of the Isopoda of the Atlantic coast of North America, with descriptions of many new species.
Mr. F. A. Lueas, in connection with work on fossil vertebrates, has engaged in studies of the gallinaceous birds and of the cormorants, and also of certain Cyprinodont fishes.
The treatise on the reptiles of Japan, prepared by Doctor Stejneger, was delayed for want of satisfactory illustrations, but toward the close of the year means were found to obtain desirable results, and it is expected that the work can soon be published. Doctor Stejneger has been engaged also on a monograph of the reptiles and batrachians of Porto Rico, and, since his return from a visit to that island, has extended the scope of his work to include a general survey of the Antilles.
Activity in mammalogy has been due almost exclusively to Mr. G. 5. Miller, jr., who has studied and published upon numerous lots of material in the Division of Mammals. He published fourteen contributions during the year, including a series of directions for preparing specimens of small mammals. His work on the free-tailed American bats has been held back awaiting the accumulation of additional material. An extended report on the mammals collected by Doctor Abbott in the islands of the South China Sea, by Mr. Miller, was completed during the year, and also a report on the mammals collected by Mr. Currie in Liberia.
Mr. Ashmead continued work on his monograph of the North American Braconide and on his reports on Japanese hymenoptera, on the hymenoptera collected by Doctor Abbott in Africa and Siam, and on the parasitic hymenoptera of the Hawaiian Islands. He completed reports on the aculeate hymenoptera of St. Vincent and Grenada received from the British Museum in 1897, and on the Australia hymenoptera collected by Albert Koebele, and others bred by Mr. W. W. Froggatt in New Zealand. Mr. Coquillett prepared monographs of the flies of the families Ephydride and Drosophilide and began a report on the Diptera of the Harriman Expedition. A monograph of the antlions of North America was begun by Mr. R. P. Currie.
Dr. J. N. Rose, besides determining the plants collected by him in Mexico, completed, conjointly with Dr. J. M. Coulter, a revision of the Umbelliferze of the United States, containing notices of about 50 species new to science. The Museum collection in this order is very rich and contains fuily 9,000 sheets.

<<<Page: 65>>>

Mr. Pollard continued his investigations of the North American violets to which reference was made last year. In this work Professor Greene, of the Catholic University of America, has largely codperated. One set of duplicate specimens was distributed last year, as mentioned in my previous report.
The head curator continued his investigations of the whalebone whales of the North Atlantic, in connection with which he located and as far as possible examined and photographed the types of the various species hitherto described.
The staff of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has, as in past years, made extensive use of the zoological collections, especially those of mammals and birds. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Mass., made comparisons of birds recently collected for him in Panama and Colombia with those from this region in the Museum. The collections of Alaskan birds were examined by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, of New Haven, Conn., in connection with his determinations of birds collected by him in the Yukon region. Dr. A. W. Grabau, who is making a special study of the mollusks of the family Fuside, spent some time in examining the Museum collections. Numerous persons brought shells to the Museum to be compared and named.
Many workers have been engaged upon the collections of the Division of Marine Invertebrates during the year. Miss H. Richardson continued work on the Isopods, Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan on West Indian corals, and Mr. W. P. Hay on crayfishes. The Museum has had the benefit of the services of these experts on several occasions. Dr. Albert Mann spent several weeks in examining the deep-sea deposits for diatoms. Several months were spent by Mrs. F. B. Arnold in general studies of invertebrates in connection with a popular work on marine life which-she is about to publish.
The collection of fishes have been made use of, as in preceding years, by various officers of the United States Fish Commission, particularly by Doctors Evermann, Kendall, and Smith, and Mr. M. C. Marsh.
The herbarium was extensively consulted during the year, both by the members of the scientific staff of the Department of Agriculture engaged in botanical work, and other botanists.
As in previous years, the use of the collections for scientific purposes is not confined to examination of material in the Museum laboratories. Large numbers of specimens are sent out for study every year to naturalists throughout the United States and in other countries.

<<<Page: 66>>>

During the past year this has obtained toa large extent as regards plants, birds, mammals, and marine invertebrates, and special mention should be made of some of the more important loans.
The collection of crustaceans of the family Alpheide, which was to have been worked up by Prof. F. H. Herrick, having been returned by him with the statement that circumstances prevented his carrying out the undertaking, it was transmitted to Dr. H. Coutiére, Museum of Natural History, Paris, who has been many years engaged in the study of the group.
Applications having been received simultaneously from Professor Edwards, of the University of Cincinnati (now of Trinity College), and Dr. Hubert L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigas, for the use of the collections of Holothurians for monographic purposes, it was decided to divide the collections, sending the Apoda: to Dr. Clark, and the remainder of the specimens to Professor Edwards. Mr. Robert W. Hall, New Haven, Conn., obtained the use of the large collection of Palemonetes for special study of that genus. Samples of ocean bottom were sent to Dr. Albert Mann, who desired to search them for diatoms.
Dr. J. Percy Moore, who has been engaged for some time in working up the collections of leeches, received an additional consignment of specimens during the year.
The Museum collection of meadow larks (35 skins) was sent to Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, for use in a revision of the genus Sturnella.
The collection of lemmings (124 skins) was lent to Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, who was engaged in a study of the species of this group of rodents.
At the request of Dr. D. S. Jordan the collections of Japanese and Corean fishes made by Messrs. Jouy, Morse, Hitchcock, and Bernadou were sent to the Leland Stanford Junior University, to aid in his work on the fish faunas of these countries.
A collection of insects of the family Saldidee (Rhynchota) was sent for the purpose of study to Prof. H. E. Summers, of the lowa Agricultural College, who is engaged in monographing the family. Specimens of Tipulidee and Ortalidz (Diptera) were lent to Prof. R. W. Doane, for monographic purposes.
A collection of Hymenoptera was sent to Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, of Mesilla Park, N. Mex., for study in connection with his investigations of the mouth parts of these insects. Several other loans of insects were made during the year.
The extensive use of the herbarium by experts outside of Washington is shown by the fact that 3,232 herbarium sheets were sent out for study during the year.

<<<Page: 67>>>

sa DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.
The demand for zoédlogical material by educational institutions showed no abatement during the year. Nearly all the sets of duplicate specimens prepared some years ago have now been distributed, and it will be necessary to form additional series at no distant date. Eighteen of the educational sets of marine invertebrates and eleven special sets were distributed.
The head curator of the department was appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum for the Pan-American Exposition, to be held at Buffalo, in 1901. A plan for the exhibition of an outline series representing the vertebrate fauna of America was formed at an early date, and in February, 1900, Doctors Stejneger and Richmond were detailed to make collections in Porto Rico and other islands of the Antilles, and Messrs. William Palmer and J. H. Riley in Cuba. As already mentioned, a large amount of valuable zodlogical and botanical material was obtained. Taxidermic work for the exposition has been carried on during the year.
On July 10, 1899, Mr. W. R. Maxon received temporary appointment as aid in the Division of Plants, and on November 16, 1899, he was regularly added to the staff and was assigned to the section of Cryptogamic collections. Mr. Sidney I. Wilson, of St. Joseph, Mo., spent several months in the Division of Birds as a volunteer assistant, with the purpose of increasing his knowledge of ornithology. The Museum has profited by the codperation of Mr. H. C. Oberholser, who determined several collections of birds during the year. Professor Greene contributed valuable expert services in the preparation of sets of herbarium specimens of the various species of violets.

By GrorGr P. MERRILL, Head Curator.
The fiscal year just closed has been one of steady progress in the department, and so far as the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology is concerned, has been notable for the marked increase in the size and value of the collections. Indeed, it is not too much to say that, so far as acquisition of material is concerned, the progress made in this section is without parallel in the history of the Museum.
The total number of accessions received by the various divisions is tabulated below, the totals for 1898-99 being also given for the sake of comparison:

It is, however, impossible to gain from these figures any tangible idea of the value or amount of materiai received, since accessions vary almost indefinitely, not only in number of specimens, but in the value of the individual objects comprising them.
In the Division of Geology the more important materials received were as follows: A series of orbicular granites from Finland, Sweden, and Rhode Island; a series of oe 400 specimens of voleanic materials from the Hawaiian Islands; some 2,000 specimens of rocks representing areas surveyed by the Dneed States Geological Survey,’ and turned into the Museum for preservation, with a view to future reference in accordance with the usual custom. These comprise rocks from the Little Belt Mountains, the Uvalde, the Anthracite and Crested Butte, and the Big Trees quadrangles; and the Silver Cliff and Rosita districts of Colorado, besides much miscellaneous material.

In the Division of Minerals the most important accession has been the private collection of Prof. Charles U. Shepard, comprising some 5,000 specimens, many of which are very choice and rare, as noted below. The meteorite collection has increased more than during any similar period in its history since the receipt of the Shepard collection of meteorites in July, 1886. This great increase is due in part to the purchase of the Allegan stone (some 64 pounds) which fell at Allegan, Michigan, on July 10, 1899. In addition to this the following specimens have been obtained: :
Aérolites. Jerome, Gove County, Kansas; Schénenberg, Bavaria; Bishopville, Sumter County, South Carolina; Indarka, Russia; Lissa, Bohemia.
Aérosiderites.—Augustinowka, Russia, and Bischtube, Russia.
The gem collection has been increased by three fine opals, and three cut Japanese beryls.
The principal accession of the year in the Section of Vertebrate Fossils has been the Marsh collection, which was formally transferred to the Museum in December, 1899. This I will refer toin detail later. In addition to this, the section has received: Through exchange with the Glen Island Museum a fine specimen of fossil gar, Lepidosteus simplex; avery perfect skull and a large part of the body of the fossil gar, Lepidosteus atrow, the gift of Mr. Charles Schuchert; types of new Jurassic fishes, described by Dr. C. R. Eastmann and transferred to the Museum by the Geological Survey; a number of specimens of a new Leuciscus, also received from the Geological Survey; a fine skull and cranium of an “/lotherium and a Diceratherium, purchased from Myr. Frank Stillwell.
The most important collections received in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology are: The Cragin collection (1,322 specimens) of Texas Jurassic fossils; the John M. Clarke collection (617 specimens) of New York Lower Helderberg fossils; the Townsend collection (864 specimens) of Guelph (Upper Silurian) fossils; a collection of some 1,002 Mesozoic fossils, collected in Wyoming by Mr. Schuchert; a series of specimens showing the twenty stages through which the Cambrian trilobite Sao hirsuta passes during its development, received in exchange from Dr. Anton Fritsch, of the Bohemian Museum; a series of corals illustrating Mr. Vaughan’s forthcoming work on American corals; a life-size model of the crustacean Stylonurus as restored by Dr. C. E. Beecher; a specimen of the rare echinoid) Oligonoporus nobilis, the gift of Mr. W. L. Woods; and from the Geological Survey a series of labeled Cambrian brachiopods (366 specimens) and Rocky Mountain, Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian fossils (740 specimens).
Additions of value in the Section of Paleobotany have come almost wholly through the United States Geological Survey, and comprise: A series of plants associated with the lavas of the Cascade Range, as described and figured by Dr. F. H. Knowlton in the Twentieth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey; plants from

<<<Page: 74>>>

-" -
the Montana formations, described by the same author in Bulletin 163 of the Survey; plants of the Payette formation described by Dr. Knowlton in the Eighteenth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey; plants from the Cascades of the Columbia; plants from Esmeralda County, Nevada; a fine series of cycads from the Freezeout Hills north of the Medicine Bow River, Carbon County, Wyoming, collected by Mr. Charles Schuchert and Dr. Lester F. Ward.
The progress in caring for the collections has been eminently satisfactory. The confusion incidental to the erection of the new galleries has been practically overcome, and it is not too much to say that the collections as a whole are in better condition now than ever before.
The installation of the systematic series in the Section of Applied Geology on the gallery in the southwest court (Plates 1 and 2) has been practically completed and some 2,500 new labels have been supplied. The reserve collection of ores has been arranged in the storage drawers beneath the rail cases and a complete card catalogue of the same prepared. Great changes have been made incidentally on the ground floor of the court, which is now given up to the building-stone collection; the collection illustrating the mineral resources of the United States, and various special collections, as the Tenth Census collection of iron ores; rocks and ores illustrating the geology of Leadville; and collections illustrating the metallurgy of gold, silver, lead, copper, zinc, and iron.
Progress in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology has been slow, since the energies of the division have been occupied almost entirely in making a temporary place for the Marsh collection. One hundred and thirteen boxes of this collection have been opened and their contents distributed and catalogued. Fifteen skulls of Z/tanotheriwin, and the limb bones of a large dinosaur have been mounted for exhibition.
In the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology Mr. Schuchert reports the mounting of 2,850 specimens of Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Ordovician, Silurian, Lower Helderberg, and Lower Carboniferous fossils. In addition, the I. H. Harris collection of Cincinnati fossils, comprising 75 boxes, has been unpacked, assorted, and prepared for installation. A large amount of material has been also added to the duplicate collections.
In the Section of Paleobotany the work of installing the Lacoe coilection has been practically completed. Many of the older Museum collections which have never been satisfactorily cared for have been overhauled and catalogued and numbers painted upon the specimens in a way, it is hoped, to avoid possible confusion in the future.
The work of building storage racks on galleries of the east south and west south ranges has been completed and satisfactory progress made in installing in the drawer space thus afforded material belonging to the sections of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleobotany.

<<<Page: 75>>>

The duplicate series designed to show the origin of soils through rock weathering and for distribution to schools and colleges, to which reference was made in my last report, has been practically completed, so far as gathering the materials is concerned; the work of labeling, wrapping, and properly describing remains yet to be done. In addition to this, some 2,000 duplicates have been weeded out from the collections of the Division of Geology alone, wrapped and labeled, and sent to the storage sheds, according to our usual custom. Mr. Schuchert reports that he has now in storage unassorted duplicate materials aggregating many thousands of specimens.
With the reorganization of 1897, the plans for a Division of Technology were sufficiently formulated to enable me to turn over a large amount of manufactured material and special exhibits, which had long been recognized as not belonging properly to the Department of Geology, but which were allowed to remain there simply that they might be cared for. The space thus gained in storage and exhibition rooms has been of material value to the department.
The constant intrusion of new materials in our exhibition: series, together with the shifting of collections made possible by the acquisition of new cases on the galleries, has brought prominently forward the question of labels, with particular reference to color, board, and character of type. It need scarcely be said that the first necessity of a label is legibility. Brevity and conciseness of statement are also important considerations. The head curator’s experience has led him to“doubt the advisability of long explanatory labels for individual specimens, excepting, it may be, in the case of large and striking objects. The name of the object in type sufficiently large and clear to catch the eye, and a few explanatory lines in smaller type, regarding source, etc., are considered the chief essentials. After many trials the form given Flote. printed on a gray board, which experience has shown to be little affected by exposure, has been adopted in the sections of Geology, Invertebrate Paleontology, and Paleobotany :—
DIAMONDS.—Cape Bort.
Diamonds of this size and quality are used in making engravers’ points and burnishing tools for watch and pencil case makers. Four pieces; weight, threeeighths karats each.
GALENA.—Sulphide of lead. A cluster of crystals showing both cubic and octahedral faces.
Gift of Davis and Murphy.

In the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology, where larger materials permit the use of larger type, an herbarium board is used. The drawback to the herbarium board in the small label, it should be stated, lies in the difficulty of getting solid black impressions sufficient to give the desired contrast and easy legibility.
In this connection copy for some 5,000 specimen labels has been prepared and sent to the Government Printing Office during the year, mainly from the sections of Geology and Invertebrate Paleontology. Up to the close of the year some 3,500 of these had been printed. Eleven large, explanatory labels, in black and gold, for the exhibition halls, have also been prepared and are awaiting framing preparatory to being put in place.
Some time has been occupied in revising and bringing up to date the manuscript of a guide to a study of the collections in the Section of Applied Geology. This is now completed, and at the date of writing is at the Government Printing Office.
The present condition of the exhibition and study series of the department can be in part surmised from what has already been said. The crowded condition of the exhibition halls has led to the with-
drawal of some of the minor and less conspicuous exhibits to give
place to larger and more striking forms, Among the recent additions of this class reference may be made to the cluster of basaltic colt from Bennau, near Asbach, Prussia, shown in Plate 3. These o¢ the same relative position to one another as when formed, and con
_to the public a much better idea of columnar structure and its cause
than do the isolated columns. The materials were obtained and set up
for the Museum under the direction of Mr. F. W. Crosby, of this
city.
The large silicified tree trunks (Araucarioxylon arizonicum) trom the so-called Fossil Forest or Chalcedony Park, near Holbrook, Arizona, which were exhibited by the department at the Omaha Exposition in 1898, have been returned to the Museum and installed in the east end of the west south range, there being no room for them with the Paleobotanical exhibit on the gallery. Unfortunately, the long trunk was broken in three pieces in process of trans-shipment, but as the fractures are sharp and unabraded, the trunk-like nature of the specimen is still apparent. The exhibit comprises this trunk, 7} feet long by 20 inches in diameter, with two cross sections each 33 inches in diameter.
The special series illustrating volcanic phenomena, faults, folds, and concretionary structures are now in a very satisfactory condition. Plate 4 shows some of the more striking forms of voleanic bombs from various locaiities comprised in the first-named exhibit,
NAT Mus 1900——-4

<<<Page: 81>>>

From the series of jointed sandstones from the Black Hills collected by Mr. N. H. Darton, of the United States Geological Survey, and mentioned in my last annual report, have been selected for exhibition the typical series shown in Plate 5. \ The sharpness and clear-cut nature | of the faulting, together with the comparatively small amount of displacement, render such blocks almost ideal for the purpose of exhibition. Advantage has been taken of opportunities for procuring examples of the peculiar concretionary forms of granitic rocks known to the Germans as ‘‘kugel” granites and otherwise as orbicular or concretionary granites. Such have been studied and described by Krutschoff, who regards them as contact phenomena and as due to the crystallizing of the granitic material about preexisting fragments of other rocks. One of the more striking forms from Sweden is shown in Plate 6.
The meteorite collection, to which reference has already been made, comprises 742 specimens, representing 349 falls. This places it among the large collections of the world, being only excelled, so far as we have knowledge, by those of Paris, London, Vienna, and the private collections of Prof. H. A. Ward and Mr. C. 5. Bement.
The collections in the Division of Mineralogy are practically all labeled, and a case at the south end of the hall has been prepared for the reception of the Shepard collection of minerals already noted. The text for a catalogue of the gem collection is well under way.
The question of getting a maximum number of specimens into a case with a minimum amount of interference or shadow has been quite satisfactorily solved, so far as the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology is concerned, by the means shown in Plate 7. As will be noted, shelving is quite done away with, with the exception of that afforded by the bottom of the case and two narrow shelves at the top for large and _ heavy materials which are often ‘‘ out of classification” as compared with the rest of the exhibit. The fossils are cemented to encaustic tiles which are of standard sizes, in units of 4-inch width, and which are prevented from falling forward through some sudden jar by an overlapping edge of wood at the top. By actual trial it has been found that, though an apparently wasteful method of installation, so far as space is concerned, more material can be actually put into a case than when the ordinary horizontal or sloping shelf is used, and, moreover, the view of one specimen is never obscured by one in front or shadowed from above. The possibly objectionable features thus far discovered are that it limits the size and weight of the specimen exhibited and necessitates the cementing of the samples to the tiles. The first-mentioned objection has proved thus far mainly theoretical, space for the larger specimens being readily found on the bottom or on the narrow shelves, while the second is avoided by not including in the series materials that would be injured or whose value would be in any way impaired by the cementing process.

The view here given (Plate 8) of the gallery in the west south range shows better than words the facilities for storage afforded by the new galleries. The Section of Paleobotany has here some 1,900 drawers, giving 10,000 square feet, and the Division of Geology 180 drawers, giving some 800 square feet of storage space. The table cases around the outer edges of the gallery serve as convenient tables for laying out material for study, while giving at the same time additional storage space beneath.
The paleobotanical series is now fairly well systematized and its value is becoming recognized, as is shown by the following quotation from a recent number of the American Geologist:
The United States National Museum has already become the great depository of the coal-plant material in this country, and, with its great number of American types, will doubtless remain a center of systematic work in this field.
For the first time in the history of the Museum all the halls devoted to exhibition purposes in geology are open to the public. Much, of course, remains to be done, but the confused and unsightly condition of affairs which has existed for nearly three years has subsided. It should be stated, however, that the work on the exhibition series of the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology has been scarcely begun, and it will require years of labor to bring this up to the standard of those which have been longer in existence.
Tons of material from the Marsh collection are stored in a rented building used as a work and store room of the department, where they must remain until they can be unpacked, sorted, and cleaned, a task which, with the present force, will occupy several years at best.
For several years past so large a proportion of the energies of the curators has been consumed in the work of installation, that very little in the way of investigation could be carried on, and almost no work of a systematic and far-reaching nature.
The head curator has devoted considerable time to the meteorite collection, and has published a preliminary paper on the stone which fell at Allegan, Michigan, in July, 1899. He has also devoted some time to the study of the collection of voleanic rocks made by Prof. C. H. Hitchcock in the island of Oahu.
Mr. Tassin has devoted some attention to the subject of hydrolosis of the metallic sulphates, especially those of iron, with particular reference to the origin of the red colors in sedimentary deposits. His work is as yet incomplete. He is also engaged in preparing a handbook on the collection of gems and meteorites.
Mr. Lucas has studied the dentition and general structure of Zeuglodon, and has prepared a paper on the pelvic girdle of the same. He has also described a new fossil from the Miocene of California, and

<<<Page: 89>>>

studied the Miocene Rhinoceros and Titanotherium, and a new Stegosaur from the Lower Cretaceous. He has also devoted some time to the study of the skull of Lepidosteus.
Mr. Schuchert has prepared a preliminary catalogue of Cephalopod genera and has devoted considerable attention to the subject of the Lower Devonian aspect of the Lower Helderberg and Oriskany formations. On this subject he is still engaged. He has also continued his work on a monograph of the American fossil starfishes.
The principal source of material for the Division of Geology, as in years past, has been the United States Geological Survey. In addition, mention should be made of the continued interest shown by Mr. F. W. Crosby, and of the cooperation of Prof. C. H. Hitchcock, in the Hawaiian Islands. .
It will be remembered that in 1887 Dr. C. U. Shepard, jr., deposited in the Museum his meteorite collection, numbering at the time 101 specimens. During the past year he has again manifested his interest in the National Museum by depositing the entire series of books, pamphlets, and manuscripts on meteorites, left by his father, the late Prof. C. U. Shepard, and, in addition, his private collection of minerals, consisting of upward of 5,000 carefully selected specimens, many of which are quite rare. The collection is particularly noteworthy for the superb series of Graves Mountain rutiles and lazulites, and also the series of southern phosphates and their associations. The collection, as a whole, forms a most important addition to our crystallographic series, and is of further interest from an historical standpoint, containing many of Prof. Shepard’s types and illustrating the classification prevalent during his day. The acquisition of these old collections is a matter of the highest importance, since such often contain materials from localities now exhausted, or which served as types in the original descriptions. Further than this, they serve to keep alive the memory of one who was a pioneer in his line of work, Prof. Shepard’s Treatise on Mineralogy, 1832, being the third work on this subject to appear in America from the hands of an American author.
It will be remembered that Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale College, served as vertebrate paleontologist to the United States Geological Survey from 1882 to 1892, inclusive. During these ten years of actual service his department received such allotments as enabled him to employ continuously from seven to ten persons in the capacities of collectors, preparators, clerks, etc., and to accumulate a quantity of exceedingly valuable material, a large proportion of which was still at New Haven at the time of his death.
After the death of Professor Marsh it was decided by the Director of the Survey, Dr. C. D, Walcott, to transfer the entire collection to

ubtiiic.

<<<Page: 91>>>



<<<Page: 92>>>

the custody of the National Museum, subject only to the usual restrictions. The work of packing and shipping, which fell to the lot of this department, under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. A. Lucas, was begun in April, 1899, as stated in my last report, and completed the following November, the final transfer being made December 8, as will be observed from an abstract of the correspondence here inserted.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, Unitep Srates GEOLOGICAL SURVEY,
December 8, 1899. Prof. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.
Dear Srr: I have the honor to state that all the vertebrate collections of the late Prof. O. C. Marsh, belonging to the Government, have been shipped from New Haven, Conn., and are now transferred to the custody of the United States National Museum, subject only to the use of such material as may be necessary for study and illustration in the completion of the monographs that were in course of preparation by Professor Marsh at the time of his death.
From a statement submitted by Mr. F. A. Lucas, who had charge of the packing of the collections, it appears that there were 1,200 trays (20 by 26 inches) of specimens, 200 unopened boxes as received from the field, 30 blocks, and 90 prepared specimens. To ship this material required 592 boxes, forming 5 carloads, having an aggregate weight of 160,000 pounds. To this there should be added 2 carloads, containing 211 boxes, received from Professor Marsh on deposit in 1891 and 1898.
The actual number of specimens represented in this collection can not be stated. They range in size from minute teeth of fossil mammals to individual specimens weighing from 500 to 2,000 pounds each. The collections are rich in large Dinosauria, especially in examples of Triceratops and Stegosaurus, while the series of Titanotherium skulls is one of the best, if not the best, in existence. It contains fifty or more complete examples cleaned, and a number in the rough, besides many hundred bones.
Among the specimens transferred are the types of forty or more species, including Dinosaurs, and Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary mammals. Among the types are the following:
Drxosaurs. JURASSIC MAMMALS. Diplodocus longus. Paurodon valens. Labrosaurus ferox. Manacodon rarus. Camptosaurus nanus. Enneodon crassus. Triceratops sulcatus. Enneodon affinis. Triceratops californis. Taodon venustus. Triceratops obtusa. CRETACEOUS MAMMAIS. Pleorocelus nanus. Priconodon crassus. Ceratosaurus nasicornis. Cimolodon agilis. Ceratops montanus. Telacodon prexstans. Ceratops alticornis. Oracodon cenulus.
CRocopDILEs. Allacodon pumilis. Rhytidodon rostratus. Batodon tenuis.
SNAKES. Allacodon fortis.
Coniophis precedens.
It is to be recalled that these collections were made by Professor Marsh during his connection with the Geological Survey, from 1882 to 1892, inclusive; that prior to his connection with the Survey he made large collections, including the toothed birds,

<<<Page: 93>>>

the Dinoceratu, Brontosaurus, many Dinosaurs, and the best Titanotherium yet discovered. He also purchased numerous collections after the stopping of allotments for his work in 1892. These collections were transferred to Yale University some time prior to his death.
As there has been considerable comment in relation to this matter, I send you a copy of a report on the examination of the collections under Professor Marsh’s charge, made by me to the Director of the Geological Survey, in 1892.
I twice visited New Haven while the collections were being packed, and am fully convinced that all material belonging to the Government has been transferred to Washington. Mr. Lucas reports that the trustees of the Peabody Museum in New Haven gave him every facility for packing the collections, and that the records were so complete that no difficulties arose in determining those specimens which belonged to the Government and those which were the property of the Peabody Museum.
The transfer of these great collections to Washington without the loss of any material, either through imperfect recording or through misunderstanding as to the ownership of specimens, reflects the greatest credit on the business-like‘methods and the integrity of Professor Marsh. The addition of the material to the National Museum places it in the front rank among museums in its collection of vertebrate fossils. It is necessary that some gaps in the collections be filled, and I sincerely trust it will be possible for the Museum to do this at an early date.
Yours respectfully, Cras. D. Watcorr, Director.
SmirHsoniAn Insrirution, December 22, 1899.
Dear Sir: I take great pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, advising me that you have transferred to the National Museum all the vertebrate fossils collected by the late Prof. O. C. Marsh belonging to the United States Government, subject only to the condition that such material as is required may be used for study and illustration in completing the monographs which were in preparation by Professor Marsh at the time of his death.
The addition of this immense collection of most important American fossil remains to the treasures already assembled in the National Museum will, I am sure, afford the greatest satisfaction to all workers in the field of paleontology both at home and abroad, and you will permit me to add a personal word in appreciation of your untiring efforts to facilitate in every way possible the great task connected with the remoyal of the collection from New Haven to Washington.
During the coming year I expect to have two preparators engaged in working out of the matrix specimens still uncleaned, and confidently hope that it may be possible in a few years to have the entire collection made available for study and a selected series for public exhibition. From this latter series the public will be able to form a correct idea as to the number, variety, and great size of these wonderful extinct creatures of the western country, and will undoubtedly be impressed with the extent and importance of the work of the paleontological divisions of the Geological Survey and the marvelous industry and intelligence displayed by Professor Marsh in bringing together this great collection.
Yours respectfully, 8. P. Lanewey, Secretary:
Hon. Cuaries D. Watcort,
Director United States Geological Survey, Washington, D. C.
As may readily be imagined, the receipt of these enormous collections, many of which were still uncleaned and in the matrix, single specimens in some instances weighing several thousand pounds, taxed the resources of the Department greatly. Fortunately the gallery in the east south range was completed, and, when fitted with standard

storage racks and drawers, furnished room for such of the material as was already cleaned. A very large share of the material could ‘not however, be brought into the Museum building without blocking the exhibition halls, and was, therefore, stored as fast as received, without unpacking, in a rented building, as already noted.
In June, 1899, the Union Pacitic Railroad Company extended to the Smithsonian Institution an invitation to send a representative of the Museum to participate in a collecting and exploring tour through the fossil fields of Wyoming. This invitation was accepted, and Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator in the Division of Invertebrate Fossils, was detailed to make the trip. Mr. Schuchert left Washington early in July and returned the last week in September.
During this time, aside from many valuable observations, he collected upward of 1,000 Jurassic invertebrates, and a very complete femur of a large Dinosaur, and purchased and donated to the Museum the particularly fine gar, Lepidosteus atrox, shown in Plate 9. He also obtained numerous lithological and mineralogical specimens.
Inasmuch as there is much popular misapprehension regarding the occurrence and mode of procedure in collecting these vertebrate remains, or rather since the public at large has no adequate conception of the skill and expense involved in collecting and so restoring such remains that they may be of value for exhibition and study, I have introduced the following extract from an article published by Mr. Schuchert in Science for November 17, 1899:
In the very beginning, alarming setbacks are encountered when climbing the hills in any direction for a “‘bone lead.’’? Having the good fortune to discover one, the real work then begins in the digging, only to find that every bone is cracked into innumerable pieces. These must be bandaged and set in plaster, and when all is hard the bones can be turned to undergo more bandaging. This means that one must have patience, be expert with pick and shovel, with gunny sacking and plaster, and with saw and hammer. However, with all these difficulties to overcome, no less than 6 carloads of bones were shipped this summer from Medicine Bow, a little village on the Union Pacific Railroad in Wyoming, by specially organized parties from the universities of Wyoming and Kansas, and the Field, Carnegie, and American museums of natural history.
In no one place are complete Dinosaur skeletons found. Sometimes a ‘‘quarry”’ will yield a lot of vertebrie, or a number of either hind or fore limbs, or there isa general mixture of parts of animals of different genera. To make an adequate collection of Jurassic Dinosaurs, therefore, requires several successful field seasons. The cost is still further enhanced since in the laboratory the bones must be cleaned, hardened, and restored before they are ready for study and exhibition. On account of these conditions and the further one that Dinosaur skeletons are very large, the work is extremely expensive. We can, therefore, believe that the best skeleton of Brontosaurus in Professor Marsh’s collection, an imperfect one, cost him $10,000.
No systematic explorations with a view to enriching the collections in paleobotany, mineralogy, or geology were undertaken, though a very considerable amount of material was obtained by exchange.

<<<Page: 97>>>

During the year there have been sent out from the Division of Geology some 18 lots of material, comprising 284 specimens for study and by exchange.
Specimens from the duplicate collection in the Division of Mineralogy have been furnished Dr. F. W. Clarke for use in his work on the composition of the various silicates, noted in the bibliography, and also to other members of the Geological Survey as occasion required. Mention should here be made of a lot of carnotite furnished to Dr. Hillebrand for his investigations, the results of which are not yet published.
The fine specimen of Lepidosteus simplex from the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology was lent to Dr. C. R. Eastman, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and has been returned. The type specimen of Agwus excelsus and other bones belonging to this genus have been lent to Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the American Museum of Natural History at New York, where they still remain.
From the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology collections were lent for purposes of study to Dr. Anton Fritsch, of Prague; Dr. E. Schellwein, of Kénigsberg, and Dr. G. Hambach, of St. Louis, Missouri.
In accordance with the usual practice, facilities for study have been afforded to students not officially connected with the institution, when such could be done without too much interference with Museum work. Dr. E. C. E. Lord, as in the year previous, has passed some time in the laboratory of the department engaged in the study of eruptive rocks from the coast of Maine. Mr. M. W. Twitchell, a graduate student of the Columbian University, has utilized the goniometer and other facilities in the Division of Mineralogy in the work of preparing his thesis for an advanced degree. Dr. O. P. Hay has spent some time in the study of the paleozoic fishes, and Dr. C. R. Eastman has utilized Museum material in the preparation of a paper on the fossil gar. Dr. A. S. Woodward, of the British Museum, made a brief examination ‘f the types of various fossil fishes in our collections. Mr. R. B. Rowe, of the Maryland Geological Survey, Prof. John M. Nichols, of Cincinnati, and Mr. E. H. Sellards, of the University of Kansas, have also had access to Museum materials in connection with their own
work. FUTURE WORK.
No radical changes in the plans for the work in any of the divisions of the department are contemplated. There remains yeta large amount of work to be done in the exhibition series in vertebrate paleontology: and paleobotany, which will doubtless consume the greater portion of the time of those in charge of these divisions for an indefinite period.
Prior to the reorganization of the Museum in 1897, the catalogues

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ay
of the various divisions had been kept quite independently of and without sufficient regard to each other, and in many cases the work was very imperfectly done, owing to lack of sufficient assistance. Under the present administration an attempt is being made to centralize and harmonize the work of cataloguing. This will, however, involve the rewriting of probably 200,000 entries as well as much careful overhauling of the records, and is a work which we can not hope to accomplish within several years. It is the intention of the head curator to give particular attention to this work during the coming year.
The department has now arrived at that stage in the building up of its collections where a proportionately small amount of material of value is received in the form of donations. If, therefore, the collections are to be systematic and well balanced, a considerable amount of money must be available for purposes of purchase. This is a matter which has been repeatedly urged and needs no further mention.

The executive curator, Dr. Frederick W. True, continued in direct charge of the administration of the Museum during the year, the Assistant Secretary exercising only a general supervision over its affairs.
There have been but few changes in connection with the scientific staff. In the death of Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing on April 10, 1900, the Museum, as well as the Bureau of Ethnology, lost one of its most active and distinguished workers during nearly a quarter of a century. Medical Director James M. Flint, U. S. N., under whose supervision the Division of Materia Medica was established in 1881, and who has been its honorary curator, under detail by the Secretary of the Navy, for three separate periods, aggregating about thirteen years, was placed on the retired list of the Navy in February, 1900. Proposing to continue his residence in Washington, however, Doctor Flint has volunteered his further services in the same capacity and they have been gladly accepted.
Mr. W. R. Maxon was appointed an aid in the Division of Plants in November, 1899.
A list of the members of the scientific and administrative staffs will be found in Appendix I.
The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of the Museum during the year ending June 30, 1900, was $238,540, as against $257,000 for the previous year. The only changes in the seyeral items, as compared with 1899, were an increase of $5,000 under preservation of collections and of $2,000 under building repairs, and a decrease of $10,000 under furniture and fixtures and of $460 under rent of workshops. The sundry civil act for 1899 also contained two special items, one of $10,000 for the construction of galleries and one of $5,000 for the purchase of the scientific library of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, which are mainly accountable for the larger appropriation in that year.

The expenditures actually made from the appropriations for 1900 up to the end of that fiscal year aggregated $224,912.42, leaving a balance of $13,627.58 to meet outstanding liabilities. During the same year $12,284.88 were disbursed from the balance ($12,629.63) of
the appropriation for 1899 remaining on July 1, 1899. The following tables show the expenditures ane 1899-1900 from the appropriations for the past two years and the balances on hand on

Disbursements to the extent of $88 were also made on account of
preservation of collections for 1897-98, leaving a balance under that item on June 30, 1900, of $9.28. Other balances remaining from the appropriations for the same year, all of which now revert to the surplus fund of the Treasury, are as follows: Furniture and fixtures, $1.23; heating and lighting, $5.49; building repairs, $4.53; galleries, $8.87; rebuilding sheds, $0.78.

Skylights have been placed in the roof of the Museum building above the four courts and above the west south, east south, and south east ranges, in all of which the lighting has been poor, especially since the construction of galleries in them. The galleries in the east, west, and south halls and the stairways leading to the galleries from the rotunda have been furnished with iron railings, and the gallery in the south east range has been extended so as to form a complete second story, adding much needed room for laboratory and storage purposes.
The old wooden floor in the main hall of the Smithsonian building, occupied by the exhibition collections of birds and mollusks, has been replaced by a terrazzo pavement, a change long contemplated, which greatly improves the comfort and appearance of the hall.
The additions to the collections during the year were embraced in 1,467 accessions and numbered 206,617 specimens, which increases the total number of specimens in the Museum to 4,819,836. The following table gives the additions and totals under the Museum classification:

The number of entries made in the catalogues of the several divisions was 22,622. In Appendix II will be found a complete list of the accessions for the year.

Seventeen thousand nine hundred and seventy packages have been received by the registrar, besides 20,824 volumes of publications. One thousand one hundred and sixty-three packages contained material for the Museum collections, and 1,236 supplies of various kinds. Three thousand six hundred and fourteen packages were sent out.
Twenty-six thousand and four specimens have been sent out as gifts or in exchange, and 12,177 specimens have been lent for study. The gifts have consisted chiefly of rocks, minerals, marine invertebrates, and casts of prehistoric implements, presented, in accordance with a long-established practice, to educational institutions in all parts of the United States. The distributions of all kinds are given in detail in Appendix III. The following table shows the number of ** lots” of specimens sent to each State and foreign country:

1 Years of Presidential inaugurations. RESEARCHES.
An account of the researches carried on by members of the Museum staff will be found in the reports of the head curators. A great deal of the work of identifying and monographing the collections is, however, performed by persons not connected with the Museum, but for the most part having relations with other establishments of learning either in this country or abroad. Such services are, with rare exceptions, rendered gratuitously, even though they be directly solicited on the part of the Museum. In very many cases, the use of specimens is given to aid in the preparation of reports undertaken in the interest of the expert himself or in behalf of the institution to which he belongs, the Museum benefiting indirectly. It is arranged, wherever possible, to have these investigations conducted in Washington, and specimens are only sent away for study when their safety can be definitely assured. Considerable progress has been made during the year, under this practice, in the working up of collections.
From the Department of Anthropology, a series of Shoshone and Ute crania was lent to Dr. A. Hrdlicka, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and a part of the collection of primitive games to Mr. Stewart Culin, director of the museum of the University of Pennsylvania. It may also be mentioned here that a number of the models of vehicles from the collections illustrating
NAT Mus 1900——5

land transportation were sent for copying to the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburg, and many models from the historical series of electrical apparatus were turned over to the United States CommissionerGeneral for exhibition at the Paris ixposition.
In zoology, the collections of mammals and birds have been utilized by the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, and those of fishes by the Fish Commission. Studies have been conducted at the Museum by Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Mass., on the birds recently received from the regionabout Panama; by Dr. Louis B. Bishop, of New Haven, Conn., on Alaskan birds in connection with those collected by him in the Yukon region, and by Dr. A. W. Graham, on the Fusidee, a family of mollusks. Miss Harriet Richardson has continued her work on the Isopod crustaceans; Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan, of the Geological Survey, his studies of West Indian and other recent corals, and Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, his investigations on crayfishes.
Arrangements for monographing the extensive collection of Holothurians were made with Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet College, Michigan, and Prof. C. L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., and the specimens have been sent to them. The Pedata were assigned to Professor Edwards and the Apoda to Professor Clark. Additional specimens of leeches were forwarded to Prof. J. Percy Moore, of the University of Pennsylvania, who has for some time been engaged in working up the Museum’s material in this group.
The principal loans of zoological material have been as follows: The collection of lemmings to Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences; the collection of meadow larks to Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, who is engaged upon a revision of the genus Sturnella, the collection of Japanese and Korean fishes to President David S. Jordan, of Leland Stanford Junior University; the crustaceans of the family Alpheidee to Dr. H. Coutiére, of the Museum of Natural History, Paris, France, and of the genus Palamonetes to Mr. Robert W. Hall, of New Haven, Conn.; a collection of Diptera to Prof. R. W. Doane, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology; a collection of Hymenoptera to Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, of Mesilla Park, N. Mex., and specimens of the family Saldidee to Prof. H. E. Summers, of the Iowa Agricultural College. Entomological specimens have also been supplied to Dr. Samuel H. Scudder, of Cambridge, Mass.; Prof. John B. Smith, of Rutgers College, New Brunswick, N. J.; Prof. C. H. Fernald, of the Massachusetts Agricultural College; Rev. George B. Hulst, of Brooklyn, N. Y.: Dr. Herman Strecker, of Reading, Pa., and Mr. William Beutenmiiller, of the American Museum of Natural History.
Specimens of plants were lent to a large number of persons, the principal sendings having been to the Gray Herbarium, at Cambridge,

<<<Page: 108>>>

Mass.; Dr. N. L. Britton, of the New York Botanical Gardens; Prof. L. M. Underwood, of Columbia University; Dr. William Trelease, of the Missouri Botanical Garden; Mr. W. W. Ashe, of the North Carolina Geological Survey; Mr. L. F. Henderson, Boston, Mass.; Mr. Alvah A. Eaton, Seabrook, N. H.; Mr. Williard N. Clute, Binghamton, N. Y.; Dr. B. W. Evermann and Theodor Holm, Washington, D. C., and Mr. Anton Heimel, Vienna, Austria.
The facilities afforded by the Department of Geology have been availed of by several persons, including assistants of the United States Geological Survey. The eruptive rocks from the coast of Maine were studied by Dr. E. C. E. Lord. The types of certain fossil fishes were examined by Dr. A. 8. Woodward, of the British Museum. The paleozoic fishes were studied by Dr. O. P. Hay, of the American Museum of Natural History, and the fossil gars by Dr. C. R. Eastman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Among others who had access to the collections were Mr. kh. B. Rowe, of the Maryland Geological Survey; Mr. EK. H. Sellards, of the University of Kansas, and Prof. John M. Nichols, of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Collections of invertebrate fossils were lent to Dr. Anton Fritsch, of Prague, Bohemia; Dr. E. Schellwein, of Kénigsberg, Prussia, and Dr. G. Hambach, of St. Louis, Mo.; and a number of specimens of fossil horse remains were sent to Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the American Museum of Natural History.
The relations of the Museum with the Executive Departments have been greatly extended during the last few years, especially as regards the War and Navy Departments in connection with their operations across the seas, through the cordial assistance rendered by officers of these two services. The historical and ethnological collections were the first to be benefited, but latterly more attention has been given to the natural features of the new possessions, and many interesting contributions in zoology and botany are now being received. It is hoped that the interest thus stimulated will lead to important results in this direction. In European countries the military branches of the governments have done much toward enriching the collections of their national museums, and it would be exceedingly unfortunate were the exceptional opportunities now presented to our own country and our own National Museum to be neglected.
The State Department, through its diplomatic and consular officers, has also been instrumental in securing much valuable material. The receipts from the Fish Commission, consisting mainly of zoological collections obtained on the Porto Rican expedition of the steamer fish Hawk, have heen of great interest. The United States Geological Survey has transmitted material from many sources, but of most

<<<Page: 109>>>

importance, and constituting perhaps the largest single accession ever received, was the well-known collection of vertebrate fossils assembled under the direction of the late Prof. O. C. Marsh, of Yale University. The scientific branches of the Department of Agriculture which engage in field collecting, the Biological Survey, the Division of Entomology, and the Division of Botany, have, as in past years, deposited in the Museum the main parts of the material resulting from the year’s work. The collections received from the Bureau of American Ethnology have been extensive and noteworthy.
Acknowledgment is due to several of the Departments for courtesies in connection with administrative matters, especially deserving of mention being the facilities afforded for the transportation of collections and assistants by the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army.
Although having very limited means for field investigations, at least a few members of the Museum staff spend a month or more during every year in adding to the collections, making their trips independently or in connection with expeditions sent out by other Government bureaus or under private auspices. Much important material is obtained in this way.
Dr. F. W. True spent several weeks of the summer of 1899 at the station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, in Newfoundland, studying the finback and humpback whales, which are taken along see: coast in large numbers.
Aten apolosieel researches were carried on in Cuba and Jamaica during the spring of 1900 by Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and Mr. William H. Holmes, head curator of anthropology, who collected many objects illustrating the ancient peoples of those islands.
Extensive zoological and botanical collections were made in Cuba and Porto Rico for the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Charles W. Richmond, Mr. William Palmer, and Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Museum staff. The groups of animals chiefly represented were birds, reptiles and batrachians, fishes, bats, insects, crustaceans and annelids. The Philippine Islands were visited in behalf of the same exposition by Col. H. H. Hilder, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, who secured a large amount of interesting material bearing upon the native tribes and the history of the islands.
The expedition to central and southern Mexico by Dr. J. N. Rose and Dr. Walter Hough, which started in the spring of 1899, as noted in the last report, continued during a part of the summer and was very successful. Its object was the collecting of botanical and ethnobotanical specimens, the latter including plants used in the arts, both ancient and modern, and examples of native handiwork. At the close

<<<Page: 110>>>

of the year Mr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., was in Venezuela with Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U. S. A., having been detailed to make collections of the higher vertebrates. Mr. Barton A. Bean was in the Vineyard Sound region of Massachusetts during part of the summer of 1899 in the interest of the Division of Fishes.
During the summer of 1899 Mr. Charles Schuchert accompanied an expedition under the auspices of the Union Pacific Railroad Company to the fossil beds of Wyoming, where he obtained many Jurassic invertebrate fossils, the femur of a large Dinosaur, and a large number of lithological and mineralogical specimens. In company with Prof. Lester F. Ward, he also collected an interesting series of fossil cycads in the same State.
On the expedition to Alaska during June and July, 1899, so elaborately equipped and carried out at the expense of Mr. EK. H. Harriman, of New York, the National Museum was represented by Mr. William H. Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and Mr. F. V. Coville. The birds, insects, mollusks, and plants obtained have been transferred to the Museum, the plants coming through the Department of Agriculture, while the insects, collected by Mr. Trevor Kincaid, of Seattle, Wash., were presented by Mr. Harriman. Before returning to Washington Mr. Dall visited the Hawaiian Islands, where he made an important collection of mollusks.
The Government explorations which contribute most constantly and extensively to the Museum are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, and the scientific bureaus of the Department of Agriculture, in all of which there was much activity during the past year. The cruise of the Fish Commission steamer A/batross to the South Pacific Ocean offered an opportunity for securing ethnological objects from many interesting islands, and through the courtesy of the Commissioner of Fisheries two of the naturalists attached to the expedition, Mr. C. H. Townsend and Mr. H. F. Moore, were authorized to collect in this field. They were successful in obtaining much valuable material. Explorations under the Department of Agriculture have been illustrated by extensive collections of plants made in Alaska by Mr. F. V. Coville and Mr. T. H. Kearney, and in Virginia and North Carolina by Mr. Kearney, and by an interesting collection of insects gathered in Porto Rico by Mr. August Busck, and of crustaceans obtained in Texas and Mexico by Messrs. Vernon Bailey, E. W. Nelson, and KE. A. Goldman. Several important accessions have also been received as the result of the field work of the Geological Survey. Interest in the needs of the Museum has been aroused among officers of the Army and Navy and observers of the Weather Bureau stationed in the West Indies and the South Pacific Ocean, and it is expected that valuable contributions will soon be received through these channels. A collection of reptiles, which he made in Texas, has been presented by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A.

<<<Page: 111>>>

Of private expeditions there have been several which benefited the Museum. Asa result of his explorations in the Malay Archipelago and other eastern localities, including Trong, Lower Siam, and Singapore, Dr. William L. Abbott has contributed a large and important collection of zoological and ethnological material, the former comprising 257 mammals, 763 birds, and 125 batrachians, besides many insects and other forms of invertebrates. Among the specimens are many species new to science and numerous others not heretofore represented in the Museum. This is only one of several expeditions through which the Museum has been placed under great indebtedness to Doctor Abbott.
While at the Samoan Islands as the British representative on the joint commission, Sir Charles Eliot found time to bring together an excellent collection of the mollusks and other marine invertebrates, which he has kindly turned over to the National Museum.
Other acquisitions, the results of private explorations, have been as follows: A series of Japanese fishes from the Leland Stanford Junior University; a collection of crustaceans made on the Brazilian coast by Dr. John C. Branner during the Branner-Agassiz expedition; a collection of Hawaiian crustaceans from Mr. H. W. Henshaw; about 300 Colombian birds from Mr. Outram Bangs; over 800 plants of the State of Washington from Mr. Kirk Whited; a valuable series of volcanic rocks and other geological material from the Hawaiian Islands, from Prof. C. H. Hitchcock.
Collecting outfits.—Outfits have been furnished to the following persons who have offered to collect material for the Museum: Prof. Dean C. Worcester, United States commissioner to the Philippine Islands; Capt. H. C. Benson, Manila; Dr. Azel Ames and Mr. L. M. McCormick, San Juan, P. R.; Mr. B. S. Bowdish, Aguadilla, P. R.; Maj. J. H. Hysell, Santiago, Cuba; Capt. O. 5. Durfee, Ciego de Ovila, Cuba; Mr. F. G. Gosling, Hamilton, Bermuda; Mr. Charles B. Taylor, Kingston, Jamaica; Mr. Fred Driver, Montserrat, West Indies; Mr. F. C. Holman, United States of Colombia; Rey. Samuel P. Craver, Montevideo, Uruguay; Mr. Paul Narbel, Cour, Lausanne, Switzerland; Dr. KE. A. Mearns, U. 8. A., Newport, R.

The Museum long ago came to be regarded by the public at large as a place where information might be sought on many scientific topics. Specimens are sent for identification and analysis, and inquiries are received bearing upon every subject within its scope, as well as upon many with which it has no relation. Every communication is answered, and so far as possible the writer’s wishes are complied with, though requests for chemical analyses can not be met, as the Museum is not equipped for work of that kind.
During the past year the demands in this direction were much greater than ever before. Over seven hundred lots of objects were received for examination, while of letters asking information there was an average of not less than one hundred weekly. As will be realized, the time of both the scientific and the clerical staff was heavily drawn upon in preparing the necessary replies. Very few of the specimens which come in this way are of any value to the Museum, while those that might be profitably added to the collections have generally to be returned to the owners, so that the Museum derives little benefit from
these sendings. PUBLICATIONS.
Volume 1 of the Annual. Report for 1897 was received from the Government Printing Office in December. The several papers composing it have also been issued in separate pamphlet form and distributed in the usual manner. The second volume of this report, still in course of printing, will contain a biographical account of Dr. George Brown Goode, the late assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National Museum, and reprints of several of his most important papers on museums and on the history of scientific progress in the United States. It is expected that the Annual Report for 1898 will be ready for distribution early in the next fiscal year. The appendix to this report will consist of only one paper—a monographic treatise on the **Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North America,” by the late Prof. Edward Drinker Cope.
Volume 21 of the Proceedings was issued in August, 1899, and 24 papers of volume 22 were printed and distributed during the year.
Part + of Bulletin No. 47, entitled ‘* The Fishes of North and Middle America,” by Dr. David Starr Jordan and Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, was printed just before the close of the year. This volume, consisting of some additions to the text, 392 plates with their explanations, and a general table of contents, completes one of the most important works thus far published by the Museum. Parts M, N,and O have also been added to Bulletin No. 39. They are entitled, respectively, ‘* The methods employed at the Naples Zoological Station for the preseryation of marine animals,” by Dr. Salvatore Lo Bianco; ‘* Directions for

<<<Page: 113>>>

preparing study specimens of small mammals,” by Gerrit S. Miller, jr.; and ‘* Directions for collecting and rearing dragon flies, stone flies, and may flies,” by Dr. James G. Needham.
A list of the publications of the Museum and of the members of its staff, issued during the year, is presented in Appendix IV. The number of authors represented is 66 and the total number of papers cited 276. The following table classifies these papers in accordance with the subjects treated:

Twenty-three papers by members of the staff, based upon Museum material, have, with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, been printed during the year in publications other than those of the Museum. Their titles will be found in the bibliography. The names of the authors are as follows: Dr. George P. Merrill, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Dr. J. N. Rose, Mr. William R. Maxon, Mr. Charles Louis Pollard, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. Charles Schuchert, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson.
The Museum library now contains over 15,000 bound volumes and 27,000 unbound papers. The additions during the year consisted of 337 books, 728 pamphlets, and 4,298 parts of periodicals. There were ~ catalogued 1,005 books, 2,699 pamphlets, and 4,924 parts of periodicals. The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed

<<<Page: 114>>>

from the central library amounted to 18,500, including 7,000 withdrawn for assignment to the sectional libraries. of which there are now 27, as follows:
Administration. Marine invertebrates. Anthropology. Materia medica.
Biology. Mesozoic fossils.
Birds. , Mineralogy.
Botany. Mollusks.
Children’s room. Oriental archeology. Comparative anatomy. Paleobotany.
Editor. Parasites.
Ethnology. Photography.
Fishes. Prehistoric anthropology. Geology. Reptiles.
History. Stratigraphic paleontology. Insects. Technology.
Mammals.
Owing to the absence in Cuba, during several months, of Mr. William
Palmer, chief taxidermist, and the detail of bis assistant during the last half of the year to the Division of Mammals, the amount of taxidermiec work accomplished has been less than usual. Sixty-five specimens in the flesh, including 81 mammals, 23 birds, and 11 reptiles, and also 116 skins of mammals, were received. Many of the fresh specimens came from the National Zoological Park. ‘Twenty-five skins were mounted for the exhibition cases and 93 were prepared for the study series. Many specimens were renovated or remounted for display purposes.
The taxidermists of the Division of Birds have remade a number of old skins, besides preparing and mounting several specimens received in the flesh. They have also reduced some of the mounted specimens to skins and have overhauled a large portion of the extensive exhibition series.
The amount of osteological work has also been smaller than usual, because of the necessity of transferring one of the assistants temporarily to the Department of Geology. One thousand skulls of mammals and the skeletons of several mammals and birds received in the flesh have, however, been cleaned. The large skeleton of the humpback whale which has been displayed in the Osteological Hall was removed, and in its place has been substituted the specimen formerly suspended in the south hall, showing both the skeleton and the exterior.
Mr. T. W. Smillie, the photographer, reports having made for the Museum during the year 435 negatives, 644 platinum prints, 175 silver prints, 1,841 blue prints, and 67 transparencies. In a museum of the

<<<Page: 115>>>

scope and character of this one a great diversity of photographic work is called for, and it is quite essential that the highest standard of: the art be attained. In this respect the National Museum has been very fortunate from the beginning, and the results accomplished have been all that could be desired, as testified by the many illustrations scattered through its publications which have been produced through this means. Mr. Smillie’s time is also partly shared with other branches of the Institution; and on the Smithsonian eclipse expedition to Wadesboro, N. C., in May, 1900, he was in immediate charge of the photographic branch. EXPOSITIONS.
Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo.—By act of Congress approved March 3, 1899, the sum of $300,000 was appropriated for a Government exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition to be held at Buffalo, N. Y.. in 1901, besides an additional sum of $200,000 for the erection of a building. Dr. Frederick W. True, executive curator, has been designated as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus on the Government board of management, and Mr. W. V. Cox as chief special agent. By the close of the past year the plans for the display on the part of the Museum had been essentially completed, and the work of bringing together and preparing the necessary collections was being rapidly pushed.
A series of models and original pieces of electrical apparatus belonging to the Henry, Morse, and Farmer collections was sent to the Paris Exposition of 1900, and several series of exhibits from the Division of Graphic Arts to the Printing Exposition held in New York City during the month of May, 1900.
Frank Hamilton Cushing, one of the collaborators in the Division of Ethnology in the National Museum, died April 10,1900. | He was born in the village of Northeast, Erie County, Pa., July 22,1857. He took a deep interest in the study of ethnology and archeology, and began making collections when but a boy. At the age of 18 he went to Cornell University for the purpose of pursuing a special course in anthropology. In 1876 he was given charge of a portion of the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, and in 1879 he entered the service of the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology. Mr. Cushing lived for many years among the Indians of the Southwest, during which time he acquired a thorough knowledge of their customs, arts, language, religion, and tribal history. In 1887 he organized and conducted important archeological explorations in the Salado and Gila valleys of Arizona under the auspices of the Hemenway Southwestern Archeological Expedition. In 1896 he was placed

<<<Page: 116>>>

in charge of an expedition sent out by the Bureau of Ethnology, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, to explore the antiquities of the west coast of Florida. This work resulted in most important discoveries, partially reported upon in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, for 1896. Among the works bearing on his explorations in Arizona that entitled ‘* Outlines of Zuni Creation Myths,” published in the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, is one of the most important. In the second annual report an interesting paper on ‘* Zuni Fetiches” appeared. Many of the articles on various phases of his explorations were published in periodicals from time to time, but it is a matter of regret that his early death precludes the possibility of publishing a large amount of material which he had brought together.
Mr. A. Zeno Shindler, who died August 18, 1899, was connected with the National Museum for many years as an artist. He was engaged largely upon ethnological work and produced a number of portrait studies of the peoples of the world, but his most notable service was in painting casts of fishes, reptiles, and other natural history specimens.

This paper was prepared in collaboration with Walter P. Jenney, William M. Fontaine, and F. H. Knowlton.
The specimens described are in the Museum collection. Theyinclude 86 species, and are from the lower part of the Cretaceous forma| tion, from the beds that extend down from the Dakota group to the upper part of the Jurassic. One new genus and 36 new species ~ are described.

19th Ann. Rep. U. S. Geol. Surv., Part 111, 1899, pp. 457-538, pls. LX VII, LX VIII.
The collections, which include about 75 species, were made at thirteen localities. They have been arranged in three groups; First, that from the horizon of the McAlester coal; second, a group from about 2,000 feet above the McAlester coal: and third, a group of localities from which a flora was collected belonging to a coal horizon about 1,500 feet below the | McAlester coal. Comparing these with the ; Carboniferous divisions of the Old World, the | McAlester flora is said to be clearly Stephanian and comparable to the flora of the Upper Coal Measures of Great Britain. The upper group belongs to a horizon some distance below the Permian, while the lower flora is plainly Westphalian, having close relations with the Middle or Lower Coal Measures of Great Britain. The fossil floras indicate a | very great expansion of the coal measures in Indian Territory.

Lower coal measures of Missouri. Monogr. U. S. Geol. Surv., XXXVI, 1899, I-XI, 1-467, pls. I-xXxxIII.
The greater portion of the specimens described in this paper were derived from two horizons about 45 feet apart. The plants described are concluded to be contemporaneous with the flora of the uppermost zone of the Westphalian of the Franco-Belgian Basin, and other coal fields of Europe.

It is not intended in the present paper to enter into a systematic discussion of Californian archeology and ethnology, but rather to present such materials as it has been my good fortune to acquire during a brief period of exploration, mainly in the central portions of the State.’ In order that these observations may have, in a measure, the proper setting, a few introductory remarks in explanation of general anthropological conditions on the Pacific coast are presented.
In considering the archeology of a great region like California, it is proper that the present aborigines and their culture should be studied, and the knowledge thus acquired utilized in discussing the prehistoric monuments and artifacts of the region. To-day there are remnants of many tribes in California, at least twenty separate linguistic stocks being represented, a really marvelous diversity in a province which, howsoever extensive (some 300 by 800 miles in extent), is not separated into very well-detined areas by orographic or other barriers. As laid down in colors on the map, the remarkable multiplicity of stocks along the Pacific coast is especially noticeable, and it seems as if the varied ethnic elements of a vast region must have been attracted, one after another, to these lowland and coastal valleys by some powerful magnet, such, for example, as that furnished by an unfailing food supply; and so formidable are the barriers of mountain ranges on the east and
'The observations recorded in these pages were made during a brief trip to California in the summer of 1898. The work was conducted under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the writer was accompanied during the major part of the journey by Dr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge of the Bureau. One of the principal objects of the journey was to look into the evidence relating to the antiquity of man in the Auriferous Gravel region of the Sierra Nevada. This subject has already received attention in a paper published in the American Anthropologist for January and October, 1899, and reprinted with additions in the Smithsonian Report for 1900, and will not be presented at length in this connection, 161 NAT Mus 1900——11

So forbidding the deserts on the south, that few communities once settled along the coast would ever take the trouble to seek homes elsewhere. It would seem that the nations were caught as fish in a trap. The way in was easy, but the way out was hard. By some such process California acquired its varied peoples. The remarkable diversity in language is thus probably largely due to the arrival of tribes already: speaking diversified tongues rather than to differentiation within present habitats.
Notwithstanding the great multiplicity of languages there is marked uniformity in the physical characters of the peopie, and culture in general is diversified only in details. We conclude that although the peoples had a common origin, no doubt in the far north, scattering and isolated occupation of vast areas of country led to multiplication of tongues, while all those elements of culture dependent upon immediate environment and readily modified by it have been remodeled into a homogeneous whole. It is probable that conditions nearly identical with those of historic times have prevailed for a long period on the Pacific coast. Archeology seems to have no strong light to throw upon the history of the region. We seek in vain for the presence of distinct peoples or indications of different conditions. We can neither trace any of the present peoples back along the course of their history to more primitive conditions, nor follow the n in their migrations far outward into regions from which they may have come. There is nothing in the past of culture that is not comprised in the present. There may have been simpler peoples, less advanced peoples, in the near or far past, but there is no trace of former higher development or the coming of strangers bearing with them germs of strange cultures from foreign lands, northern or southern, Asiatic, European, or Polynesian. ’
We observe, also, that in its ensemble Californian culture is sharply marked off even from that of most of the neighboring peoples—as, for
example, the Pueblos, the Mound-Builders, and the Mexicans. Art in stone, upon which archeology must largely depend, is practically uniform at all points in the California province, differences being due largely to variations in local resources. The absence of certain forms of implements and utensils common elsewhere is especially noteworthy. There are no grooved axes’ and no celts, past or present. Sculpture of life forms is almost wholly absent, and building in stone was and is unknown. At the same time many of the classes of artifacts found in California are peculiar to the region. The mortar and the pestle are most notable features of the domestic outfit of the coast, and though, in one form or another, present in many sections of America, are nowhere so prevalent and so varied in shape. The grinding plate and

<<<Page: 206>>>

muller are almost equally numerous, and it is probably to the acorn that the region owes the remarkable development of these utensils; and the wide distribution of the oak tree over the slope in a measure regulates the distribution of the tribes, tending to foster a very general but rather scattering occupation by small communities. It is thus that the tribes have always been but slightly associated and wholly without the ability to unite in concerted action.
Simultaneously with the development of the mortar and grinding plate there grew up the art of olla or stone vessel making, and the discovery of extensive deposits of soapstone on the far-away island of Santa Catalina led to a new and distinctive group of artifacts confined to the channel islands and the neighboring coastal districts.
A most notable peculiarity of the art of the region is the rarity of earthenware, which for some undiscovered reason was never utilized, save in the making of rude balls of baked clay for use in slings and in sporadic efforts at vessel making. The rude earthen vases found in the Tulare region and elsewhere are probably mainly of recent origin, and the practice of the art by the mission tribes of the South is no doubt a late Shoshonean transfer from the Colorado Valley. Utensils of stone and wood occupied the field covered by pottery in other sections, and basketry grew into unexampled importance, displaying remarkably varied phases of form, technique, and embellishment.
Sea shells, which abound along the entire coast, and especially the haliotis and the clam, have furnished material for personal ornaments and helped to determine their character, and the great deposits of obsidian toward the north have probably given an impetus to flaked stone art among all the tribes.
We might expect at first glance to find dividing lines, more or less distinct, between the peoples of the south and those of the north, and between those of the Sierra belt on the east, the chain of valleys traversing the middle of the State from north to south, and the coastal zone, but the differences are not of great importance, as no barrier exists to prevent free intercourse between neighboring sections. The north has evidently been affected by the farther north, but the south has hardly felt the influence of the more advanced tribes of the Colorado Valley.
That the peoples are of Asiatic origin I see no reason to doubt, but to speak of them as Chinese, Malay, or Tartar in origin, without very considerable qualification, is a great mistake. Although all may have arrived, more or less directly, from the north, and primarily from the shores of Bering Sea and beyond, it is not likely that any particular Asiatic strain ever passed the north Pacific arch, ran the gauntlet of interfering and opposing nations, and reached far-away California in even approximate purity. That any particular language of the many

<<<Page: 207>>>

existing intemperate Asia should be preserved throughout the centuries of migration and struggle and appear in California so unchanged as to be identified with a given Asiatic tongue to-day is not to be expected, and it is manifest folly to continue the search for traces of Asiatic arts and industries other than those that may have been transferred in recent times by means of modern ships. Every art, save the most elementary, would be lost or transformed in passing the frigid gateway. Religion, social institutions, government, industries, all would change with changing conditions and be remodeled in each of the numerous distinctive environments encountered between Tartary and California. Agriculture, pastoral arts, metallurgy, ceramics, and all forms of domestic art would be obliterated, and other activities, such as weaving, stone-shaping, house-building, hunting, and fishing, would be so completely modified that no knowledge of original practices would remain in the mind of any individual or be preserved in any tradition. What is now found, old or new, in the culture of California, is America’s own, if not, indeed, fully and absolutely Californian. The incoming populations of the coast had to discover the metals, and could not have developed the arts of using them until ages after reaching the temperate zone. Clay existed everywhere in plenty, but tribes arriving from the far north would be slow to discover its use in the arts and cast aside inherited arctic forms of utensils. It has not yet in any part of the coast usurped the place of skin, bark, and wood in vessel making, although neighboring provinces on the east and south have been potters for many centuries. Before soapstone came into use it had to be found in far out of the way places; and the group of milling arts, now so important a feature in the economy of the people, had no prototypes in the frigid zone, where the diet was exclusively animal. It would be useless even to guess at the time required for the development of the group of arts and industries characterizing the aboriginal culture of California.
Study of analogies in blood and culture, with the view of establishing more than the most general relationships between American and transoceanic nations, has been and no doubt will be quite in vain. The question of a possible very ancient autochthonic people is sometimes raised, but as yet there is apparently no sufficient basis upon which to discuss the proposition. If there were such people in America they must now be merged fully into the Asiatic populations of the present period. The same would be true also of the culture. We may well pursue the study of Californian archeology with practical certainty that, whatever the origin of the people, we are, in the main, elucidating local and sublocal culture. With language it is different. Although changing rapidly with altered conditions, speech has little tendency toward uniformity among distinct nations. Twenty peoples coming from different regions to California, bringing as many distinct

<<<Page: 208>>>

languages, might still speak twenty different languages after the other activities had been modified and remodeled as in a common mold by the local environment.
The first stop of our party in California was at Nevada City, Nevada County. Here archeological investigations were made and collections of basketry and stone implements were secured from some families of **Hi-eet” Indians (Pujunan stock), whose village is on the table-land about a mile west of the city. A recent fire had deprived these poor people of their wooden houses, and they were lodging in improvised shelters, brooding over their misfortunes. There are hardly more than a dozen individuals, all told. They are not, however, ill favored and debased in appearance, and compare very well with other tribes of corresponding condition and habits. The men work in the mines or at other occupations when opportunity offers, and the women gather acorns—still a large factor in their domestic life—grind them in the stone mills, and prepare the food; they also continue to make baskets in the usual style of the Sierra tribes. It is not pleasant for the ethnologist to note, however, that the gunnysack is taking the place of the strongly woven carrying basket, that the iron pestle and muller are superseding those of stone, and that cooking on iron stoves and in tin utensils is being substituted for the old-time stone-boiling in tightly woven baskets.
Several milling places were found near the dwellings, where convenient masses of granite happened to be exposed. A dozen conical depressions, some shallow and some deep, were scattered over the rock surfaces, and all about were the mealing stones, some nearly round, others oval, flattish, or cylindrical, a few well shaped, the others rude. Some were suited for grinding by abrasion, others by pounding, the shape being accommodated to the contour of the depression in which they were to be used. These milling places are usually covered by a rude pole and brush shelter, which serves to protect from sun and rain the women (Plate 1), who spend much of their time at the mills. Besides the fixed mortars, there were seen about the dwellings both round and flattish mortars and mealing stones, with accompanying pestles and mullers used in the minor pulverizing work of the household. Illustrations of typical forms from neighboring districts are given farther on. The archeological features of the vicinity are referred to in the paper, already mentioned, devoted to evidences of auriferous gravel man. It was observed that in particular the modern villagers dwelt above the brinks of the great mines, and that stray artifacts necessarily found their way into the excavations. Search was made for the mine from which one of the specimens, a mortar, referred to by Josiah D. Whitney in his work on the Auriferous Gravels of

<<<Page: 209>>>

California, ‘is said to have come, and it was ascertained that this mine was confined to a small gulch, at the head of which stands an oak grove suited in every way for occupation by the acorn-using natives of the district.
Nevada City is picturesquely situated on the banks of a mountain torrent known as Deer Creek, and evidences of former mining activity are visible on all hands. The gravels occur in extensive deposits, and though rich in gold are not yet nearly worked out, the enactment of laws limiting the use of water for hydraulic operations having greatly retarded the work.
From Nevada City it is a day’s journey to Forest Hill, the county seat of Placer County—a great mining center in former days. The trip was made by rail to Colfax, on the Central Pacific R. R., and thence by stage coach across the magnificent canyon of the North Fork of American River. These Sierra valleys are all of absorbing interest to the student of human history, for it is held by many that man inhabited this region long before the vast gorges began to be excavated, and the grand ranges culminating in the snow-capped Sierra began to be carved out. As our coach crept wearily up the eastern rim of the valley, and, long after nightfall, passed out over the crest through the’ mining town of Yankee Jim, 2,000 feet above the river behind us, we for the first time realized the full significance and magnitude of the proposition advocated by Whitney, namely, that human bones and relics of advanced culture occur in large numbers in the original formations of these mountain crests—formations laid down in the stream beds of a river system already obliterated in Tertiary times, and long before the erosion of the present valleys began. The particular object of our visit to this district was to learn something of the possible origin of the objects of art reported by Whitney as coming from the mines, and at the same time to collect from the native villages scattered over the district such objects of interest for the ethnologist as the people possessed.
The village of Yankee Jim is located on the brink or rim of the great valley of the North Fork of the American, and Forest Hill, 2 miles farther on across the plateau-like crest, overlooks the superb valley of Middle Fork. Professor Whitney says,’ on the authority of Mr. C. D. Voy, that stone implements were found in 1864, about a mile south of the town of Forest Hill, at a depth in the gold-bearing gravels of about 10 feet. One of the most interesting of these was a flat dish, or platter, worked out of hard granite, and about 18 inches in diameter. We at once sought out those residents of the locality

<<<Page: 210>>>

best qualified to inform us regarding the mines and their history, and were so fortunate as to meet Mr. Richard Clark, a well-known citizen and extensive mine owner, who had been in the district from the very beginning. It was soon learned that the great Dardanelles mine, owned and worked by Mr. Clark, was about | mile south of the village, and in his company the site was at once visited. The mine occurs several hundred feet down the slope descending into the canyon of the Middle Fork, and on a narrow bench called Oro Flat. Here the outcropping margin of the gravel deposits of a Tertiary river channel are exposed in a heavy deposit 200 to 400 feet thick. The mining operations destroyed a large part of the flat, leaving at the upper margin, when active work ceased ten years ago, an irregular gravel cliff half a mile long, exposing the full thickness of the gravels now considerably weathered down and gullied by erosion. Approaching from above, we descended to the flat and halted upon a rounded portion of the surface overlooking the brink of the mine. Here was a small farm, and a field immediately above the deepest part of the mine was quite bare, although it had not been cultivated apparently for some years. It was soon discovered that the spot had been extensively occupied by the native peoples, and in the course of the forenoon a dozen mealing stones and mortars (Plate 2), thirty hand stones and pestles (Plate 3), and many minor relics—mainly arrow and spear points—were collected. It was noticed that the outer margin of the site had been encroached upon by the mine and perhaps a third or half of it had been destroyed. It was further seen that the site slopes toward the vertical brink of the mine, and that many gullies are cut, growing deeper toward the cliff, and that near the margin they are so deep and precipitous that it was unsafe to enter them. The relics were found all over the field, but more abundantly in the gullies where they had rolled and lodged; but all were surely on their way to the mine. Naturally, only the smaller, flatter objects remained, the round pestles and the globular mortars had long since found their way into the mine below, where they became intermingled with the great mass of loose gravels and bowlders. Some specimens were found far down the sides of the mine lodged on ledges and in heaps of débris, and the fact was impressed upon our minds that finds of stone relics in the mine, unless made by expert observers, could have no value as an index of age. On the brink of the mine were found also conical mortar basins werked in the surface of large bowlders and outcropping rocks. Mr. Clark assured us that this site had not been occupied by the natives since the opening of the mine in 1852, and it is clear that as the mining work went on all along the lower margin of this site the stone implements rolled in, and it is no wonder that collectors were able to secure from it the flat dish or platter of granite referred to by Whitney, for a dozen of these objects were still scattered along the brink

above ready to fall in as the work of the miner advanced. Plates 2 and 3 illustrate part of the finds made on this spot. It is observed that these relics do not correspond fully with those of the modern Indian sites, that the mullers are smaller and rounder and more neatly shaped, and that the smaller stone objects are of varieties not now in use. This, however, does not necessarily indicate different peoples, but probably results from changes in habits due to contact with the whites and the degeneracy of aboriginal work in general.
At Yankee Jim, at one time a very lively camp, but now a small village, we visited a mine being opened by Mr. Robert Clark, and spent an hour at an Indian dwelling on the hill slope near the mine. The photograph of a dismantled mill shown in Plate 4 a, was secured at this place. The shallow mortars, similar to those shown in Plate 2, were sunk in the ground so that they can just be distinguished in the picture. The hand stones consisted of several rather rudely shaped ovoid and cylindrical stones (Plate 44), a small, oblong, flattish grinding stone pecked away at one end to make it available as a pestle, and three or four iron wagon-axle pestles. Some of these hand stones evidently served both for pounding and rubbing, while one or two are slightly concave on one side, indicating their use also for cracking acorns upon or as mortars for pulverizing in a small way. The fact that some of the mortars and grinding plates of California are well rounded and finished on the margins and base while others are rude and unfinished has been noted by several writers, but I do not recall mention of the fact that the unfinished ones are intended for planting in the ground, leaving only the concave grinding surface exposed, while the finished ones, at least those of smaller size, are portable household utensils. What ethnical significance there may be in this is not determined. The differences in form may be due to the presence of distinct peoples on the site, or to diversity in the practices of a single people at the same or at different times.
Learning of an Indian settlement in Todd’s Valley, + miles south of Forest Hill, we drove down and spent a day in the vicinity. Here also we found extensive gravel mines, similarly situated to those at Oro Flat, and native settlements in “intimate association with them. The residence of an Indian family stands on the very brink of the mine, and doubtless the site has been long occupied.
While Dr. McGee was engaged in his usual occupation of securing vocabularies and hints of the customs and history of the people, I looked into their milling places and learned what I could of their arts. The principal dwelling is a frame house of two or three rooms and a porch, while about are the mill house and other simple shelters. An elderly woman, Susan by name (her native name could not be learned: from any source), having tattoo marks on her chin, had near at hand a very snug little shelter made of sticks, bark, and foliage, in which

she lived and carried on her share of the family drudgery. She ground acorns on a flat stone disk set in the ground near the middle of her shelter, and by the side of this was a slight depression in the hard earth used as a hearth. She boiled the porridge outside by heating small stones in an open fire and lifting them into the cooking baskets with a pair of neatly trimmed and pointed pine sticks about 5 feet in length. When the water was boiled the stones were removed with other sticks, and when the porridge became somewhat firm it was dipped out with a cup into another basket and was ready for use. This food was not at all unpalatable, as it had been deprived of the bitter taste of the acorn by leaching. This process consists in scooping out a depression in a bed of sand, into which the meal is poured and soaked with water until the bitterness is absorbed by the sand. The gruel is then taken up and is ready for cooking. The baskets used were of excellent make and tastefully ornamented. By dint of long bargaining and insisting we were able to secure half a dozen examples of the good woman’s handiwork. Some of these are shown in Plates 5, 6, and 7. They are typical specimens of the basketry of this portion of California, and seem to combine some of the characteristics of the basket work of the surrounding tribes. They are new, and we were quite unable to-buy the baskets in present use. We were shown one featherdecorated piece, said to have been made by an aunt of the young woman of the household at some distant point. It was valued very highly, having een a gift, and we could not secure it. It was stated that the use of feathers was not common among the American River tribes. Some of their carrying baskets and the gleaning paddles and meal-fanning trays, they informed us, were of Paiute make.
A very interesting mealing outfit was encountered on the hillside above the dwelling and near the margin of the mine. It had been deserted for some time, but the poles of the shelter were still in place. There were four or five shallow mortars worked on the surface of a rock even with the surrounding ground, and sixteen hand stones, comprising numerous shapes ranging from a flat ovoid rubbing stone to a well-formed and symmetric pestle. We were also shown an acorncracking outfit, consisting of a small round stone with a shallow pit on the upper surface for resting the acorn and a globular stone for striking. The acorn is set on end to receive the blow. Stones of various shapes are used, according to the supply on hand, and in the absence of suitable stones the cracking is done with the teeth. Details of the grinding and other operations are given a little farther on.
On the bottom of the mine, 200 feet beneath the spot occupied by the mealing place just described, we found a large stone having a deep conical mortar on one side. It had evidently fallen in from above, and had probably escaped the attention of seekers after evidence of Tertiary man.

<<<Page: 225>>>

The dwelling of Porter, the headman of the small group of native families in this vicinity, is a short distance below the mine. It is of rude construction, and is distinguished from the ordinary dwellings by its circular shape and radiating clapboard roof. Similar houses were encountered in Calaveras County, and an illustration is given in Plate 8. They are probably the communal or council houses, or survivals of these. .
From Forest Hill we returned to Colfax, and were soon in San Francisco. From this place visits were made to other points of interest. Another excursion to the auriferous gravel region was made, by way of Stockton, Oakdale, and Jamestown. At Jamestown we were within easy reach of many interesting points ethnologically and archeologically. This district includes Tuolumne Table Mountain and the mining towns of Sonora, Murphys, and Angels, and has furnished much of the testimony upon which the theory of an auriferous gravel man has been supported. In recent centuries it has been occupied by a numerous population of the Sierra tribes. The finds in the auriferous gravels are fully discussed in a paper already referred ‘to, and I need here mention them but casually, giving chief attention to the remnants of native population scattered here and there in small bands over the hills and along the valleys. Half a mile south of Jamestown we encountered a small aboriginal community occupying half a dozen houses, built in the main of sawed lumber and fairly comfortable. The people were carrying on the usual acorn industry, using utensils of native make and grinding and preparing the meal in the native way, but otherwise showing many indications of contact with the whites.
A second community. of like character and proportions was located a mile to the west, on the slopes of Table Mountain. These people showed indications of thrift, and their simple arts were carried on under the shade of their own vine and fig tree. One man, exhibiting traces of negro blood, and having a wife quite half white, was engaged in rounding the ends of the shingles to be used in giving an ornamental! effect to the walls of his house. It is said that in this district, when the mines were being extensively worked and a large white population filled the country, there were also large numbers of Indians gathered on the outskirts of the towns, ten or a hundred times more than are found in the vicinity at the present time.
Ancient village sites are numerous, and old native burial places are common. At Springfield, 10 miles north of Jamestown, an old miner named John Cannon had two well-shaped globular mortars in his back yard. These were so highly valued by Mrs. Cannon as receptacles for watering the chickens that we had difficulty in securing one

of them (Plate 9a). Mr. Cannon stated that he found them several years ago in a mine on Mormon Creek near by. They were embedded in auriferous gravels 5 or 6 feet deep, and at the same place, but a little deeper, he uncovered a number of skeletons, accompanied by
yarious relics—implements of stone and ornaments of shell. That the
ay lk oh ke
burials were comparatively recent is indicated by the fact that the hair of the scalps was well preserved. From Patrick Shine, a little farther on, I secured a flattish, plate-like mortar, some 8 inches in diameter and of usual type, that he declared had been obtained from a mine on his place at a depth of 80 feet.
Old village sites were found at Saw Mill Flat, 8 miles northeast of Jamestown, on the brink of a deserted mine, and at the entrance to the tunnel of Montezuma mine, on Table Mountain, 3 miles southwest of Jamestown. Near Columbia, which was a great mining center in the early days, there is a large granite outcrop, exhibiting a considerable group of mortars of the usual form, sunk in the surface.
The journey from Jamestown to Murphys and Angels gave us the opportunity of crossing the valley of the Stanislaus at two points— Robinson and Parrott ferries—and the impression made on our minds by the gorge of the American Fork was strengthened by the experience. The proposition necessarily entertained by believers in auriferous gravel man that these vast valleys with their lofty and widespreading walls have been eroded within the human period seems too preposterous to be entertained. The descents are made by well-kept roads, but the way is long and often precipitous, and the scenery is exceedingly impressive.
On the plateau beyond the canyon the limestone belt begins, and as a result canyons, caverns, and natural bridges are common. Near Murphys a visit was made to Mercer’s cave, which is entered by a contracted irregular opening descending almost vertically and expanding into a series of irregular crevice-like chambers, the result of the solution of a particular limestone stratum by underground waters. Through the appreciative courtesy of Mr. W. J. Mercer we were able to examine the cavern and to dig for human remains in the débris directly beneath the opening. A few fragments only were found, but Mr. Mercer had previously secured some skulls and other portions of skeletons. They were not old and were not coated with calcareous matter, having been buried but a short time in the loose earth which had fallen in from the opening. One of these skulls was presented to the U. S. National Museum by Mr. Mercer, and the result of an examination by Dr. George A. Dorsey shows that it resembles very closely the so-called Calaveras skull of Whitney.'
At a considerable depth, and not directly beneath the opening, we were shown portions of a skeleton of some large animal. Some frag-

ments were secured and examined by Mr. F. A. Lucas, of the U. S. National Museum, who found them to belong to a gigantic sloth, one of the Tertiary Mylodons. Mr. Mercer says that about 2 miles beyond the cavern there is a burial pit from which he previously obtained human bones and obsidian implements.
On the partially wooded ridge overlooking Murphys on the north and within half a mile of the cave, we came upon an Indian village, comprising half a dozen dwelling houses and the usual accompaniment of summer shelters and milling places. Two of the houses are shown in Plate 8. They are round and upward of 25 feet in diameter. The walls are formed of planks and the roof is covered with clapboards radiating from a conical, shingled chimney. The framework is of poles and the construction does not differ essentially from that of the aboriginal round-house of many tribes. The men and women all appeared to be busy with domestic affairs, the work being conducted in a large roofed structure, open at the sides; and in a .ittle conical shelter made of sticks and brush, on the slope below the village, we found two old women pounding acorns.
In one of the houses was quite a store of basketry, some of the pieces evidently homemade, but others the work of the Paiute and
other neighboring tribes. Within the group of houses was an inter-_
esting granary—a tall wattlework receptacle resting upon a stem of wood and further supported by four marginal poles. Its purpose was no doubt to place the crop of acorns, corn, or other food material beyond the reach of rats and pigs.
A single family, the remnant of a larger community, is located on the Adams place, a little to the eastward of the village of Murphys, anda small village was encountered on the road from Vallecito to Angels, a few miles south of Murphys. Here I procured some photographs of a rather comely Indian woman engaged in the arduous task of grinding acorns, her interesting family of three chi.dren entering prominently into the pictures (Plates 12 and 13). Plates 10 and 11 serve to illustrate two of the first steps in the acorn industry, the carrying and hulling of the acorns, and the use of the mealing plate in grinding. The upper view in Plate 12 shows the miller as she sits over the craterlike cone of pulverized acorns with the heavy pestle raised in front of her face. As the pestle descends into the center of the heap, spreading it out over the margin of the mortar, one hand or the other is freed and deftly rakes the meal toward the center of the stone again and joins the other hand to raise the stone, the whole movement being so rapid that there is no pause in the operation of pounding. The shallow mortar, formed of a flattish stone, is planted in the ground even with the surface, and the meal spreads out on the firmly-impacted soil. The basket receptacle for the meal, covered with the fanning basket tray, is at her right hand, and the children, engaged in play,

are on her left. Two mealing stones are seen in the foreground, which combine the functions and shape of both muller and pestle. The ends are used as a pestle for pulverizing (Plate 12 a), and the slightly flattish sides are fashioned for rubbing (Plate 11). In the lower picture (Plate 12>), the woman is engaged in tossing the meal in the fanning basket, separating the husks and brushing them off at one side. The partially filled basket of meal is seen on her right. In the upper picture (Plate 13) the meal has been nearly all cleaned up and the basket receptacle is well filled with the fine flour. In the lower picture (Plate 13) a curious change has come over the scene. By some misadventure the woman became conscious of the fact that the visitors were taking her picture and ceased to work, appearing frightened, for they all seem to know what the little black kodak box means and seriously object to being photographed. As a rule it was unsafe to show the camera among these people, for in a moment there would be a general disappearance and a necessary cessation of friendly communication and trade. Behind the miller in the last picture two stone mortars may be seen set in the ground. Formerly there was a considerable group of milling stones here, but at the time of our visit the shelter had been removed and the mill had apparently been for some time neglected.
I introduce here four other pictures, illustrating successive steps in the work of preparing the acorns for food. The upper view, Plate 14a, shows the process of clearing the meal of chaff by tossing and blowing. Plate 144 is intended to illustrate the process of leaching the meal in a bed of sand. The boiling in baskets is shown in Plate 15, a and 4.
The houses in this rancheria, three or four in number, are built, as usual, of slab walls and clapboard roofs. The lower view, Plate 8, shows one of the brush shelters or summer houses under which the family sits and most of the domestic work is carried on. Here, as elsewhere, there is a distressing admixture of tinware, ovens, etc., with the native utensils. The only man seen in the place was astrong, swarthy individual, who took no notice whatever of the visitors, being absorbed in the task of filing a crosscut saw.
There are many collections of archeological and ethnological objects in California, but altogether they inadequately represent the rich field so conveniently at hand. There has been little systematic collection, and a splendid opportunity has been lost. The vast accumulations of wealth for which the coast is noted have accrued to those who had no appreciation of the native history of the coast or who lacked the public spirit to endow museums. The future Californian will realize this more fully and regretfully than the Californian of to-day.*
' Fortunately the statement here made is no longer true. Subsequent to the stereotyping of this paper it is announced that Mrs. Phoebe Hearst has provided liberally for anthropological researches, to be under the direction of the University of California.

In San Francisco the Golden Gate Museum has acquired considerable material, portions of which are well identified and of value to science, but Curator Wilcomb has not been able to give any considerable time or funds to collection. The Academy of Sciences also has a large collection, but so heterogeneous in character and so deficient in associated data as to be of no great anthropological value. Private collectors
have done good work in limited fields, and I refer with pleasure to the —
very valuable collection of baskets brought together by Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Briggs.
The State University at Berkeley has not attempted to acquire collections, but has had placed in its care a large number of stone implements and utensils brought together by Mr. C. D. Voy and attributed in the main to the auriferous gravels of the central districts of the State.’ The Stanford University has made a very creditable effort to gather and preserve the precious relics of native art, but so far has not been able to enlist the services of curators competent to give the collections standing as scientific material.” Such collections as I was able to exanvine in other parts of the State are referred to in connection with notes relating to the localities to which they pertain.
From San Francisco a run was made north to Ukiah, in Mendocino County, the chief object being to pay a visit to Dr. J. W. Hudson and have a look at his collection of basketry, reputed to be one of the finest in the West. While at Ukiah we had the opportunity of visiting two villages of the Pomo Indians (Kulanapan linguistic family), who are among the most interesting tribes of the region. Their dwellings are roughly constructed of frame and weatherboarding, and must be comparatively comfortable, save in severe winter weather. Little trace is seen of aboriginal construction or modes of life. The ruin of a large earth lodge, used formerly for ceremonial purposes, is found in one of the villages. It is illustrated in Plates 16 and 17.
The people have not entirely lost their nomadic habits, and at certain seasons wander in small bands along the rivers and over the mountains, hunting, fishing, and gathering fruits and seeds, carrying their possessions on their backs, and putting up simple brush shelters for protection against the weather.
These Indians are past masters in basket making, and Doctor Hudson, in his twenty years of practice in the vicinity and his frequent visits to the villages, has had exceptional opportunities for making
'T have to acknowledge the kind assistance of Professor J. C. Merriam, curator of the State University collections, in my study of these relics.

collections. He has gathered only choice pieces, and among these are many feather-decorated specimens of exceptional beauty. Arrangements were made for securing this collection for the Smithsonian Institution, and before the end of the year it was forwarded to Washington. I will not attempt to describe it, leaving that pleasant task to Professor Mason, who has made minute studies of that branch of native art, and, with the help of the carefully prepared notes of Doctor Hudson, a valuable contribution may be expected. In Plates 18, 19, and 20 a few notable specimens are shown. They serve for comparison with the Sierra Indian and Tulare work, illustrated in other portions of this paper.
I was interested in watching the women making baskets, Plate 21a, and the men grinding and drilling clam-shell wampun, Plate 21 6. These people rely very largely on the acorn for their food, and the carrying basket, Plate 22 a, and the mortar and pestle, Plate 22 4, are constantly in evidence. The drawings represent the people in their native costumes, which have, however, been superseded in recent years by trousers and calico gowns.
The following interesting notes, furnished Professor Mason by Doctor Hudson, relate to Pomo bread making, dress, and forms of the drill:
Indian corn, or maize, is not indigenous west of the Sierra Mountains, and is not and never was used by our ‘‘ Diggers.’? Acorns, buckeyes, and weed seed (about twenty-five varieties), notably the tar weed (Madaria sp.), also berries of a number of plants, especially manzanita (Arctostaphylos tomentosa), madrona, wild rose, and mountain laurel, are their staples, important in the order mentioned. Teuni bread is made of any of the eight varieties of acorns—Nuci, from Quercus agrifolia, and Tsupa, from Quercus densiflora, being valued as the sweetest. The nutsare sun dried, then hulled, then reduced to flour by the stone pestle and basket mortar, and cleaned by frequent siftings. A shallow pit is made in fine sand and pressed smooth with the hands; the meal is poured in and covered with leaves of iris (Iris macrosiphon). Fresh water is then poured on in quantities and the meal is stirred until it is thoroughly leached. Within an hour it can be gently lifted out in large pieces. Another pit is prepared for the oven, in which a fierce fire is started; stones the size of a smoothing iron are thrown in and, when very hot, half of them are taken out. The remainder form a griddle in the coals and are covered with wet leaves, oak and iris, on which the dough, which is the acorn meal mixed with 5 per cent of Masil, or red earth in solution; also sometimes the same amount of tar weed meal, Mako, is-evenly spread. Wet leaves are placed over this; then the hot stones; then about 6 inches of earth. In six or eight hours the oven is opened, disclosing a large, flat cake incrusted in leaves, and smelling somewhat like bread. The Masil, or red ceremonial yeast, has given a dark-red cast, while the Mako turns it almost black. The taste is not unpleasant. It is flavored with an impure salt gathered either on the coast or at a spring on Eel River.
Buckeye Disa: The nuts are roasted in hot rocks, hulled and peeled with a deerrib knife, then mashed in a basket with a heavy billet, like a giant potato masher, Disapawohai, then leached as above, and in the form of paste eaten hot or cold.
Pinole (Spanish) or To-o is a mush of acorn meal, leached of course, mixed with a percentage of other seed meals, boiled in a Tee or Bamtoosh basket by dropping hot

round stones into it until the contents are cooked. It has the consistency of mush, and is quite insipid. Wheat is now often substituted. It is toasted in a plaque with live coals, then mortared out into flour and cooked as above.
Other cakes are Mako, Malalkato, Bimu, named from constituents and methods of preparing. Yuhu is a coarse, unpalatable cake made from acorns (Quercus wislizeni).
All of the above except the wheaten cakes are of ancient origin.
The ordinary aboriginal dress of a man was a skirt, Kauxi, of the bark of a willow (Salix nigra), or of bulrush stems shredded. A mantle of skin, panther preferred, is tied over the shoulders and belted at the waist. A thick chaplet of mountain laurel covers the head. The woman has a deerskin mantle or chemise above and the Kauxi below; the head is usually bare. She sits generally on a tule mat at her work; the man kneels when drilling wampum, or at like labor.
The pump drill was introduced into Ukiah Valley by a Spaniard in the early seventies, and was carried into Potter Valley about the year 1876 by old blind George, now living. The aboriginal tool was called Dawihai (da win, to bore, hai, a stick), and was a straight shaft of wood, 2 feet long and half an inch in diameter at the middle . The drill point was of jasper or flint, and fastened to the shaft by a lashing of hemp (Apocynum cannabinum), and coated with pitch. Its origin is beyond tradition.
Early reports on the antiquities of California somewhat casually mention the occurrence of mounds in various parts of. the State. Later investigations have furnished definite knowledge of the shell mounds and kitchen-middens along the coast, and of the earthworks in the interior valleys. Quite recently a new chapter has been added to the history of aboriginal California as a result of researches among the mounds of the great inland basins, including the valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and the basins of Tulare Lake and Kern River. These earthworks were erected by a much simpler and less ambitious people than the mound-builders of the Mississippi Valley. They are scattered over the low lands, mainly in the tule flats, where annual inundations are or were common. They are not arranged in any systematic order and show none of the specialization of form characterizing the mounds of the east or of Mexico and Central America on the south. They are roundish in outline and rarely more than 10 or 12 feet in height, although a few are reported to reach 20 feet; the profiles are gently rounded as a result of the crumbling nature of the earth of which they are composed (Plate 23 @), and the area covered is often quite extensive. It appears that in the main they were erected primarily for domiciliary purposes and as places of retreat in time of overflow. ‘They were also used as burial places, though probably not originally erected for this purpose, and a few are literally filled with human remains (Plate 23 5). :
The exceptional environment furnished by these interior valleys has evidently given rise to a somewhat peculiar phase of local culture,

differing from that of the coastal belt on the west and from the foothills and sierra on the east. There was a tendency toward sedentary life, fostered, no doubt, by an unfailing food supply, which consisted of fish and waterfowl! in great plenty, and many vegetable products, including acorns, seeds, roots, and various kinds of fruit. The occurrence of inundations in the lowlands must have interfered to some extent with full sedentation, the people being driven periodically into the higher plains and foothills.
It seems likely that the earthworks scattered along these valleys were built by one or more of the tribes found in possession—the Wintun, the Maidu, the Mutsun, the Yokuts, and the Shoshone (Powers)—since neither the works themselves, their contents, nor the miscellaneous artifacts of the valley present features discordant with the condition and achievements of these peoples. I believe that no important distinction has been drawn between the implements and utensils of the mounds and those of the surface of the country generally. The osseous remains exhibit no novel or distinctive features.
Implements and utensils have a wide range in form and in the classes represented, but withal are simple in character and indicate no unusual advance in culture. They include mortars, milling plates, pestles, and rubbing stones, of usual range of form, cylindrical steatite vases of local type (Plate 247), stone pipes, rings, discoidal stones, grooved pebbles, and flaked implements of many forms. Certain obsidian implements of the Stockton district present exceptional characters (Plate 25). There are also tools of bone and shell and ornaments in great variety. There are many objects of baked clay, globular, discoidal, dumb-bell shape, ete., some of which may have served for use in slings (Plates 26, 27@and 28). This use of clay balls is noted as occurring among some of the modern tribes. The artistic sense was evidently not greatly developed among these people, as attested by the almost entire absence of the carving or engraving of life forms. In Plate 284 a number of bone implements obtained from these mounds and tastefully decorated with incised workings are shown. They are, for the most part, whistles, or flutes,and correspond closely with similar objects found in mounds and middens along the California coast. Among the pendant ornaments of abalone shell are specimens representing, apparently, a double-headed bird, suggesting the double-headed eagle of European nations (Plate 24 6), but the conception is quite as likely to be of purely native origin. In general the contents of the mounds include few relics of recent origin.
Enterprising archeologists in Stockton have made valuable collections from the mounds of the neighboring lowlands. Mr. H. C. Meredith has published a number of articles describing and illustrating his explorations and finds, and Mr. J. A. Barr has made a most valuable collection, chiefly from local mounds. Prof. Edward Hughes,

<<<Page: 275>>>

of the city schools, has also taken a deep interest in local archeology and kindly drove out with our party to the neighboring flats, where a number of mounds were examined.
The objects shown in the accompanying pletes belong to the Stockton collections or were presented to the U. S. National Museum by Stockton collectors. Brief descriptions are given in connection with the plates and more detailed information may be obtained from the writings of Mr. Meredith.*
On our way south from San Francisco to Los Angeles we made it a point to stop at Porterville, in Tulare County, long enough to pay a visit to the Tulare Indians” located on South Fork of Tule River, 20 miles eastward from the village. Their reservation was originally situated on the fertile lowlands where the river valley opens out upon the plain, but this land was acquired by the whites and is now largely under cultivation. The Indians were removed to the upper valley,
where they now dwell in comfortable, though simple, frame houses. .
Here the narrow, rocky banks of the river rise abruptly into massive and precipitous mountains. It is indeed a secluded and lonely spot, an ideal retreat for the humble remnant of a people once laying claim to the broad, rich lowlands now traversed by railways and dotted with incipient cities. The houses are scattered at short intervals for 2 or 3 miles along the valley. A little farming is done and some stock is kept, and there is a school near the agent’s residence, attended at the present time by twenty or thirty children.
Near the upper end of the reservation a most interesting spot, known as Painted Rock, or The Painted Rocks, was visited. Here the little stream is confined to a narrow gorge bordered by enormous masses of granite, over which the torrents pour in the wet season. At the sides, however, there is enough comparatively level ground to accommodate dwellings and small fields. This site, it appears, was a favorite resort of the native peoples, the Tulares or their predecessors, for a long period of years. The protected surfaces of the great granite blocks are still covered with symbolic paintings in bright colors, and some of the flatter exposed surfaces are pitted with mortar basins wherein the women of many generations have come to grind acorns and seeds. In Plate 29 are shown two excellent illustrations of one of these milling places, there being between forty and fifty more or less deeply sunken conical mortars visible. Another large, rounded mass near by contains upward of seventy-five of these pits, varying from shallow basins or incipient mortars to conical depressions a foot in depth.

Portions of this rock are now covered with soil, so that a number of the mortars are probably hidden. Possibly some of the depressions may originally have been pot holes, worn by the descending waters of the cascade, but all are now manifestly artificial in contour. The present inhabitants do not appear to use these particular mills, but employ mortars, both fixed and portable, in the immediate vicinity of their dwellings. This may be the group of mortars referred to by Powers, who says that ‘‘in remote times they were accustomed to rub their acorns to flour. on a stone slightly hollowed, like the Mexican metate, which was a suggestion of the Mouse, but nowadays they pound them in holes on top of huge bowlders, which was a suggestion of the wiser Coyote. On a bowlder in Coarse Gold Gulch I counted 86 of these acorn holes, which shows that they must have beeu used many centuries.” '
My own feeling about this matter is that the metate is a late rather than an early form of the millstone, since these great groups of mortar pits must be very old, and the mortars dug up at considerable depths in this valley as well as elsewhere are generally globular. I was especially interested in observing that the process of shaping stone by pecking with hammers is known to the Tulares. Some specimens show recent work, and inquiry of Mr. James Alto elicited the statement that the women shaped mortars and pestles in this way, employing ‘*‘ days pecking and pecking.”
At one of the dwellings, which had the appearance of an ordinary, comfortable farmhouse, the entire family was engaged in thrashing and cleaning up the recently harvested crop of beans. Plate 30 shows the man threshing with a flail, while the women are seen separating the beans from the hulls by fanning in shallow basket trays. From the old woman of the household—the grandmother—who seemed to be owner of all domestic articles, we secured baskets, stone boiling sticks, mortars, and pestles. The large, roundish mortar shown in Plate 31 was in use by one of the women, but we were told that this piece had been found at a depth of several feet in digging an irrigating trench; that it was very old, and belonged, they believed, to peoples that had preceded the Tulares. However, such mortars, as well as others of varying form, were seen in use on the reservation.
The manner of using snares in capturing pigeons is shown in Plate 32. Roundish earthen platforms from 5 to 8 feet in diameter are constructed among the great bowlders in favorable locations, on which are set willow-twig loops for securing decoy birds. At one margin of the platform a brush or reed shelter is built, in which the man with the snares hides himself. The loops of the snares lie extended upon the platform, and when the birds, alighting to feed with the decoys,

<<<Page: 279>>>

become entangled they are quietly withdrawn beneath the shelter and secured (Plate 324). The lower illustration, a, shows James Alto, the —
reservation policeman, emerging upon the platform from the shelter. Powers mentions the use of snares, probably of this class. He says
that ‘‘for snaring quail, rabbits, and other small game they employed ~
cords made of a kind of ‘ wild flax’ found in the Sierras. 1 presume this ‘ wild flax’ is milkweed (Asclepias).” In Plate 33a we have a drawing of one of the snares and in 6 a game basket of peculiar form. In the same plate are included a pair of wooden fire sticks or tongs, ¢, and a looped stick for lifting stones from the boiling baskets, d. The native
scrubbing brushes and the yucca bulbs from which they are made are —
illustrated in Plate 34.
At one of the houses near the pictured rocks I was so fortunate as to obtain parts of a ceremonial costume, consisting of a feather headdress, ear ornaments, thorn needle with asphaltum head, etc., shown in Plate 35. The importance attached to these articles was made apparent by the care with which they were wrapped up in especially prepared coverings and hidden away. ‘There was also a more complete costume in possession of one of the men of the family, but this could not be secured. It included the primitive skirt made of long strands, forming a fringe, upon which are strung pine nuts and beads. It was said that these were parts of old time ceremonial dance costumes, still used on great festal occasions.
The Tulares are among the most expert of basket makers. Plate 36 illustrates three winnowing baskets, and Plates 37 and 38 three bowl shaped pieces of excellent quality. The fine specimen shown in Plate 39 aand / and Plate 40 was obtained from the good woman, Mrs. Pedro Tennis, who had just completed it. The low, flat-topped bottle form is apparently peculiar to this tribe. Occasionally a piece is seen much flatter in the body than this specimen. The workmanship and vesthetic treatment are of a high order, and the deteriorating influence of modern conditions is seen only in the use of red worsted, which I suppose takes the place of red feathers of earlier times. The baskets in use to-day include also carrying baskets of usual California types.
The native names for the basket-making materials and for the various articles illustrated in the accompanying plates are not given for the reason that I had no time to verify the data secured from James Alto, although he seems a thoroughly honest and intelligent man.
I was particularly anxious to secure one of their gambling trays, which are large, flat basket plaques, but the last specimen in the valley, so it was said, had recently been carried away by a collector. We were so fortunate, however, as to secure an unusually old and fine example through the courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. C. F. Briggs, of San Francisco, who had obtained it from an old woman living on a ran-

cheria near Lemoore, in Kings County, who parted with her treasure only after the strongest persuasion on the part of the visitors. It is shown in Plate 41.
_ The following account of the game as played by the Tulares is quoted from Mr. Stephen Powers:
The Gualala style of gambling prevails all over the State, but the Yokuts have another sort which pertains exclusively to the women. It is a kind of dice throwing, and is called u-chu-us. Fora dice they take half of a large acorn or walnut shell, fill it level with pitch and pounded charcoal, and inlay it with bits of brightcolored abalone shells. For a dice table they weave a very large, fine basket tray, almost flat, and ornamented with devices woven in black or brown, mostly rude imitations of trees and geometrical figures. Four squaws sit around it to play, and a fifth keeps tally with fifteen sticks. There are eight dice, and they scoop them up in their hands and dash them into the basket, counting one when two or five flat surfaces turn up.
_ The rapidity with which the game goes forward is wonderful, and the players seem totally oblivious to all things in the world beside. After each throw that a player makes she exclaims yet-ni (equivalent to ‘‘one-y’’), or wi-a-tak, or ko-mai-eh, which are simply a kind of sing-song or chanting. One old squaw, with scarcely a tooth in her head, one eye gone, her face all withered, but with a lower jaw of iron ‘and features denoting extraordinary will—a reckless old gambler and evidently a teacher of the others—after each throw would grab into the basket and jerk her hand across it, as if by the motion of the air to turn the dice over before they settled, and ejaculate wiatak! It was amusing to see the savage energy with which this fierce old ag carried on the game. The others were modest and spoke in low tones, but she seemed to be unaware of the existence of anybody around her.!
The account given by Mrs. Briggs is to the same effect. In Plate
42 I venture to reproduce a drawing illustrating the use of the gaming tray as set forth so vividly in Mr. Powers’s account.
Southern California has much to interest the student of archeology “as well as the traveler seeking an ideal country. It is a region occupied formerly by numerous and probably greatly diversified peoples, presenting, however, no great dissimilarity in culture. Their contact on the east and south was with peoples lower in the scale of progress than themselves, and it appears that few elements of culture from the more distant regions ever crept in. A small number of widely scattered aboriginal communities still survive to the presert day, but present no very considerable points of interest to the student, their original ustoms having been destroyed or greatly modified by mission rule.
_ The region including Santa Barbara County and the group of islands lying off the coast is probably the richest, archeologically, in California and furnishes vast numbers of artifacts of usual classes, among
which the mortar and pestle predominate to a remarkable degree. A

Mr. W. 5 Campbell, a local dealer in Indian relics, has many interesting things, prominent among which are a number of rare and beautiful baskets made by the Santa Ynez Indians, a tribe now approaching extinction, Other collections made by Rey. Stephen Bowers are partly in his own n hands and partly in possession of Mr. H. N. Rust, of South Pasadena. In addition, a large and valuable collection, not, however, purely local, is owned by Mrs. A. C. Low, of Pasadena. Mr. Rust’s collection also contains an interesting series of objects from an ancient village site in the suburbs of Pasadena, and he permits me to introduce here two plates, in which are seen a large number of the objects collected Plates 43 and 44. In this collection there are no globular mortars or cylindrical pestles, but numerous mealing plates showing extensive use, and many oblong and discoid mullers. Several annular and stellar shaped stones are unique. The whole group seems to indicate a people related in many ways with the tribes of the Sierra. The village site from which the specimens illustrated were collected is situated on the bluff overlooking South Pasadena and on the line of Buena Vista street. When the grading of this street was under way Mr. Rust watched the work daily, saving more than «a hundred implements and utensils. He was able even to locate some of the lodge sites by the larger number and greater variety of specimens found within limited areas. Besides the stone implements shown in the plates, one bone awl and a fire stick were recovered. Few flaked implements are found in the Pasadena region, and there is no pottery, and burial places an¢ human remains have been sought for in vain. At Santa Barbara I was per mitted to examine a valuable collection made by Mr. L. G. Dreyfus, and the museum of the local historical society has many specimens of interest. The region has been explorec by a number of scientific students, including Schumacher, Henshaw, Yarrow, and Yates. The principal village site at Santa Barbara is 0 the extreme end of a picturesque promontory at the lower end of the city, and the sea is slowly cutting itaway. The location of the buria ground is indicated in the view presented in Plate 45 by a group oi apple trees seen distinctly in the lower picture. Near by, on the loy ground, is a large oblong mound, now occupied by a residence ant believed by Mr. Dreyfus and others to be of artificial origin. From Los Angeles it is a short railway journey to San Pedro, the coast, and a steamer voyage of 25 miles out into the Pacific carrie one to Avalon, a village occupying an exquisitely picturesque little harbor near the east end of Santa Catalina Island. While at this plae I had the opportunity of examining two of the noted archeological

sites of this island—the soapstone quarries of Potts Valley and the ‘shell deposits of the isthmus. These sites were explored by Schumacher many years ago, and the rich collections obtained by him are now preserved in the museums at Washington and Cambridge. I need not do more in this place than briefly record my observations and ‘impressions regarding these sites.
Early in the morning of November 2, 1898, 1 set out on horseback with Mexican Joe as guide, to find the soapstone quarries some 10 ‘niles to the northwest. We climbed the steep slopes from Avalon, ‘meandered the lofty sinuous crests of the island, passing across the shoulder of Black Jack—a mountain rising nearly 1,800 feet above the sea—and descended into Potts Valley, which, if my identification be correct, opens down to the sea on the north of the ridge. At many points we encountered outcrops of steatite, and evidences of ancient mining were apparent on all hands. There were shallow excavations and heaps of débris surrounded by fragments of partially shaped vessels and the rude stone picks, hammers, and chisels with which the quarrying and shaping work was done. Near the site of the principal quarry reported upon by Schumacher there has been some recent quarrying by white settlers, but fortunately the outcrop from which the aborigines cut so many pots remains undisturbed. At the head of the shallow amphitheater of Potts Valley, which descends to the shore half a mile or more below, some great masses of rugged rock rise from the otherwise smooth slopes. Portions of these masses are composed of soapstone, and the surfaces from which lumps of soft rock were cut are in plain view. A vigorous growth of cactus plants covers the lower part of the exposure, but enough remains in sight to tell the story of former enterprise. The scars left by the workmen extend over 400 or 500 square feet of the steep surfaces of the rocky mass, and the views shown in Plate 46 disclose the scars and chisel marks to excellent advantage. The work of removing the rounded masses of stone from which the vessels were to be shaped was identical in character with that observed in the many soapstone quarries of the Eastern States, but so far as the markings now remaining show, the cutting has been more skillful, and it seems not improbable that the work in the examples illustrated has been done with metallic tools. It is reasonable to suppose that the trade in soapstone pots, carried on extensively between the islanders and the tribes of the mainland, continued to flourish for a considerable period after the coming of the white man, and in the latest work iron picks and shovels must have been used. Scattered about this rock and on the slopes above and below ere fragments of partially shaped and broken vessels, besides numerus rude cutting tools and picks of hard stone. The latter implements 1ad been shaped by flaking with hammer stones, some of which are distributed with the débris.

My own contribution to the study of this interesting spot was the discovery of an ancient grave on the nearly level top of a rounded knoll some 40 or 50 feet above the upper quarry face. I happened to— observe the broken edge of a soapstone platter projecting above the hard soil. In removing this specimen other objects were brought tolight. Remnants of a skull and jawbone and numerous bones of the’ trunk were found, but all were so near the surface that they had been more or less dissociated and broken up. There were also parts of three or four steatite vessels, one small pot, a round shallow dish, two oblong dishes, and a flattish oblong plate with squared end, probably’ a baking plate. Other articles were evidently mere burial offerings made for the purpose and doubtless symbolic. They include a steatite hook of a form common in the region, a miniature pestle of steatite, a peculiar object, apparently a much conventionalized fish or finback whale, three handles of steatite utensils, apparently dipper handles, an obsidian arrow point, and some much decayed shell ornaments. A number of these objects are shown in Plate 47. {
The relation of the grave to the quarry face is shown in Plate 48. The figure in the foreground represents my companion engaged in exploring the grave, and the worked soapstone surface is behind him at the right. Beyond are the rugged cliffs, with a bit of the sea visible at the left. 7
My study of this site was far from exhaustive, but I gained the © impression that the ancient occupation had extended over a very long period. This must be the case if the vast number of utensils found in the region have had their origin in these quarries. I observed that — the phenomena are practically identical with those of soapstone quar— ries of the east. .
In a rock shelter some 200 Piet southeast of the quarry examined I found evidence of ancient occupation. Deposits of kitchen-midden refuse cover the slope below, and in these were many abalone shells and some rude stone utensils, the latter including a flattish spatulate stone, one end of which was covered with asphaltum, as if used fous Game in applying the liquid material. .
Santa Catalina Island is extremely rugged and picturesque, and the coast is in large part inaccessible, but there are a number of small bays and inlets about the inner margins of which there is land enough to accommodate small settlements. One of the most favorable localities for a native village was at the point called the Isthmus, about 14 miles north of Avalon, where the opposite shores approach within a few hundred yards, and there is a low pass, not 20 feet in elevation, between the opposing beaches. The upper view in Plate 49 looks | from this pass outward toward the Pacific, and the lower picture shows » the opposite side turning toward the north. The houses in the latte view were occupied at the time of my visit, but I have learned from

Mr. E. L. Doran, of Avalon, who kindly carried me in his gasoline launch to this spot, that Banning Brothers, who own most of the island, have begun extensive improvements, changing the appearance of the place and obliterating the ancient cemetery. The houses in the view are situated on the village site examined so carefully by Dr. Paul Schumacher and reported upon by him in a number of publications. The site was covered by several feet of midden refuse composed of black earth and shells, and in which were many burials. It is clear that this site was extensively utilized by the natives, and that an important village stood here for a long period. It appears also that it was occupied at the time of the arrival of the whites and fora considerable period subsequently, as the graves contained many articles of iron and glass.
Numerous interesting details regarding the ancient remains of the island are given in a charming little book published by Mr. Charles F. Holder,’ who has adopted the island as a home, and a map is presented in his work locating many village sites, cemeteries, and shell heaps. The evidences of occupation are so numerous and extensive that, as with the other islands of the group, there must have been formerly a large population, not differing essentially, however, in blood or culture from the people of the mainland.
Although soapstone was used so extensively on the islands and carried in great quantities to the mainland, other stones were not neglected, and sandstone especially was employed. In some cases, no doubt, it was cut from the living rock, but more commonly waterworn masses, already approximately shaped, were used. In some sections also concretionary forms were utilized, many of which were already rounded and hollowed out on one side, making the work of shaping easy. The manipulation of sandstone in the making of mortars and pestles is illustrated in Plate 50.
Mr. Horatio N. Rust, of South Pasadena, whose collections have already received attention, has had more or less intimate contact with a number of Mission tribes, and I prevailed upon him to visit the Coahuilas and other convenient communities for the purpose of making collections for the Museum. At Coahuila Mr. Rust called upon José Costa, prominent among the Indians of southern California. The family was found in a new wooden house, the old adobe residence having recently been destroyed by an earthquake. He found the old mother sitting under the brush shelter where she lives, making a basket. This, when finished, was purchased, and along with an unfinished specimen was forwarded to the Museum. In the collection also are specimens of the materials used. In making the better baskets she used a strong grass, which is scarce and much prized. It grows only high up

in the mountains. Mr. Rust found it on the banks of a small stream at Bergman post-office at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, growing in bunches like pampas grass and resembling that variety very closely, — These people also make baskets of bulrushes which are dyed black. — The rich brown mottling seen in many of the baskets is due to the natural color of the base of the bulrush, the upper stem being lighter in hue. Splints of a hard wood are also employed in basket making. A — woman was seen reducing these to a uniform size by drawing them — through a hole ina tin can cover, and often biting them into shape — with her teeth. Children were learning to make baskets, and it appears that many more are manufactured than formerly, since ready sale is — found for them. Southern California baskets are much coarser than those farther north in the State. They make rude baskets, from 3 to 5 feet in diameter and 3 feet high, of willow splints, in which they store grain, acorns, and other food products. These are placed upon scaffolds about 6 feet high, constructed by setting strong forked posts in the ground and laying poles across. |
At Agua Caliente women were seen making pottery, and specimens were secured at Coahuila, Santa Rosa, and San Felipe. After grinding the clay in a mortar and kneading it they form the base of the vessel by placing a small portion upon a flat stone and bringing it into the desired shape with the fingers. When the base has assumed the form of a saucer they hold a smooth waterworn stone on the inside to " support it, while with a smaller stone kept wet they rub the outside, curving the walls gradually upward; then drawing in the edge they form the neck by skillfully manipulating the clay with the fingers. To harden and even up the walls of the vessel they hold a smooth stone inside and beat the outside with a rude paddle. Specimens of the modeling tools were secured for the Museum. At Agua Caliente pottery is baked in an oven, to form which they dig into the side of a bank and line the walls with cow dung. The vessel is then introduced and | covered with the fuel. When the fire is well under way they close up | the opening and permit the vessel to remain until properly baked.
These people spin strong hempen and mescal cords by twisting the thread in the fingers. Next they hold the newly formed cord against the thigh and twist it under the palm of the hand. At Agua Caliente they make valuable saddle blankets of mescal fiber. These are woven on four stakes driven in the ground, the weavers sitting on opposite sides on the ground. |
At Mallayhon Mr. Rust witnessed the spinning of hemp and the — making of nets. The hemp is prepared by beating the ripened stems until the wood is thoroughly broken, when the bark fiber is separated — and ready for spinning. The meshes of the net are tied about a stick | held between the knees. q

The dressing of deer skins required very simple devices. A smoothly shaved, flattish stick about 6 feet long was placed in a slanting position against a convenient tree. The skin was hung over the stick and held at the top by a peg, and the hair and flesh were removed by pressing the skin against the flat stick and scraping with an old iron drawing knife. The skin was first soaked im water until the hair and flesh were easily scraped off. _ In earlier times stone impiements were used, the skin being spread on the ground or over a smooth rock. In finishing the Indians apply grease or brains and scrape and rub until soft.
The maguey or American aloe or mescal grows wild among th mountains of the California desert. To prepare it for food the Indians dig or cut out the bases of the stalks which bear the leaf stems. These vary from 6 to 20 inches in diameter. To cook them they dig
~a saucer-shaped pit from 10 to 20 feet in diameter, then set a large
stone up in the center and pave the entire surface with smaller stones. Upon this they build a fire, mixing the mescal stumps and wood together and thus burn the woody fiber from the mescal. The smaller stumps are kept near the outside, and as they become sufficiently burned are thrown out, then the larger ones in turn. When they are done the mescal is piled about the central stone and covered with hot stones. Next they cover all with earth, allowing it to remain forty-eight hours. When the pile cools down the mescal is ready for use. Cooked specimens often measure 6 inches in diameter. The taste resembles that of sirup baked out of sweet apples. It is very agreeable food and will keep perfectly good for months.
Sometimes it is necessary to go a long way for wood to burn, and several families make their pits near together for the sake of company. When they have no metal they burn an ironwood of the desert and sharpen the end fora digging tool. The mescal is ready for cutting when it begins to send up its flower stalk. If the Indian can not cut and bake all he wants at the proper time he cuts out the growing flower stem, which checks the growth, and the plant keeps in this condition for months.
Acorns form an important article of food. The Indians crack them with the teeth or a stone, partly dry, then shell and dry again. When dry they are ground in stone mortars, then the fine flour is soaked in ollas to remove the tannin, and the mixture is poured into basins formi@d in the sand. For some days they pour water into the basins until the tannin is all filtered out; the flour settles in the sand basin as a thick paste. This is scooped up by hand and placed in an olla. Having thus secured the most of it without sand, they gather up the balance regardless of sand, put it in another olla, add water, stir it well, and pour off the paste, leaving the sand. Ir this way the ‘* Byota” or acorn meal is prepared, sweet and wholesome, and much preferred by the Indian to our wheat flour.

By Orrs Turron Mason, Curator, Division of Ethnology.
The aborigines of the Western Hemisphere were intimateiy associated with the animal world. Their methods of taking animals for their activities were as follows:
1. Gathering without devices.
2. Gathering with devices.
3. Striking, stunning, bruising.
4. Slashing with edged weapons.
5. Piercing, by stabbing, by thrusting, by hurling, or by shooting.
6. Taking in traps or blinds.
. Hunting by means of other animals.
8. Capturing with light, fire, and smoke.
9. Overcoming by asphyxiation, poisons, and drugs.
In piercing devices the ends proposed are two, namely, to reach some vital part, and hence to kill instantly, or to insert a barb or toggle under the skin and thereby retrieve the animal. These piercing devices may be divided into three subclasses, namely: Those with a smooth blade, called lances, for stabbing; those whose blades or working part have barbs on the sides for retrieving as well as piercing, and the harpoon subclass with movable head. A harpoon is a piercing and retrieving device with a movable head. Few other inventions of savagery show better the progress of thought in devising means for overcoming difficulties than the harpoon. In order to differentiate this implement from others of the piercing type, let it be understood that the head is always set loosely on the end of a shaft, to which it is attached by means of a line. Even when shot from a bow, missiles having this structure are called harpoon arrows. Every part of the harpoon, by its dimensions and form, by its presence or absence, or by its material and attachment, lends itself to classification in the studies of progress concerning the apparatus itself and its geographic distribution.

<<<Page: 341>>>

Between the sharpened stick or bone, which wounds by piercing and which is the fundamental device of all lanceolate weapons, and the harpoon, there are one or two intermediate forms among the Eskimo usually associated with the harpoon. They may be called the hinged lance head and the detachable lance head. In the first named the ivory or bone piece, into the front of which the leaf-shaped blade is set, is at its other extremity hinged to the foreshaft, like the loose shaft of a whale harpoon. The detachable lance head has a handle or tang of wood about a foot in length and less than an inch in diameter. On the front is set a leaf-shaped or a triangular blade, and the conical base of the tang fits into a socket in the end of the heavy shaft. In some examples there is an ivory barb projecting from the handle near the blade, which is a spear characteristic, but in this instance it was designed to retrieve the lance head and not the animal. E. W. Nelson figures and describes a great variety of these. He says in relation to them that they are used when the seal or walrus has been disabled so that it can not keep out of reach of its pursuers, and the hunter paddles up close alongside and strikes the animal, driving the detachable head in its entire length. The head remains in the animal, and the hunter immediately fits another point into the shaft and repeats the blow, thus inserting as many of the barbed heads as possible, until the animal is killed or the supply of points exhausted. Every hunter has his private mark cut on these points, so that, when the animal is secured, each is enabled to reclaim his own. These lances are companions of harpoons, and examples will be shown in their proper connection.
The manner of functioning with the harpoon will be considered only incidentally here, inasmuch as there is abundant literature on the subject prepared by those who have been eyewitnesses of its action (see frontispiece). For the Eskimo the student may consult Dall (1877), Holm (1887), Boas (1888), Turner (1894), Murdoch (1892), and Nelson (1899). The older writings are abundantly quoted in these, and the titles of authorities for the western Eskimo will be found in H. H. Bancroft (1874-1876). It is with pleasure here acknowledged that the ‘areful observations of these explorers on the spot have made possible this comparative study.
The fundamental or ideal parts of the harpoon are head, loose shaft, foreshaft, shaft, ice pick, line, and float. These parts rarely all coexist in a single specimen, but the Eskimo have them all on their various harpoons, while each part also takes on a multitude of forms and itself is often quite complex. Besides these fundamental parts, there are also a number of accessories, which will be considered in their places.

There are two varieties of harpoons, based on the shape of the head—the barbed and the toggle; but the former or simpler passes insensibly into the latter. Barbed harpoon heads are attached to the shaft by means of a connecting line tied to the butt or tang of the head, and may be used on animals with tough hides (see fig. 12). The toggle harpoon head is attached to its line or sling by its middle, the head is driven entirely into the animal, and toggling under the skin gives the firmest possible hold (see fig. 1). It will give the best idea of the apparatus to take up the parts of the harpoon in order, and after that to study the question of distribution.
The parts of a complete barbed harpoon are barbed head, foreshaft, shaft, line, feather, and bladder (Plates 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18, and 19).
Barbed head.—TYhe head of a barbed harpoon is a piece of wood, bone, antler, ivory, shell, or metal, with tooth-like projections from its margins pointing backward, so that it may pierce the hides of animals but can not be withdrawn. Its action is to ratchet and retrieve the game. The parts of a barbed head may be referred to as point, body, margins or edges, sides or faces, barbs, line hole or groove, and tang (see figs. 18, L8 and 81). As to position the barbs are unilateral or bilateral, The unilateral may be from one to many. Bilateral barbs are sagittate, alternate, or opposite. The tang is wedge-shaped, conical, or spindle-shaped, and in relation to the connecting line is roughened, notched, bulbous, or pierced.
Foreshaft.—The foreshaft of a barbed harpoon is a more or less cylindrical or pear-shaped piece of heavy material, bone or ivory, fitted on to the end of the shaft, and having a socket in front to receive the tang of the barbed head. In the rudest harpoons, such as the Fuegian, nothing of the kind exists. In some examples the foreshaft is elaborately carved in imitation of the heads of aquatic animals. The attachment of the foreshaft to the shaft is by means of a splice, a wedge-shaped tang and kerf, a socket in the shaft fitting a projection on the foreshaft, or a socket in the loose shaft fitting a projection on the shaft.'| There is no other part of the mechanism which taxed aboriginal skill more than the joint between shaft and foreshaft. The socket in the front of the foreshaft for the tang of the barbed head has inserted in it a plug of wood having a small cavity into which the tang of the head fits loosely. The loose shaft and the shaft are bound fast together with sinew twine or fine rawhide line, the many ingenious knots appearing in the drawings (see fig. 83).
Shaft.—The shaft of a barbed harpoon is of wood, generally rigid, but of light weight. In length it varies from a few inches to many
'E. W. Nelson, The Eskimo about Bering Strait, 1899, pl. Lvi1h, figs. 33, 34.

<<<Page: 343>>>

feet; in thickness, from one-fourth of an inch to more than one inch. Its front end may be fitted to a foreshaft, but in the most primitive examples there is a rude split or a mere cavity dug for the tang of the barb. The manual or inner end of the shaft varies in form, being either tapering and without function, or fitted to receive the hook of a throwing stick, or notched for a bowstring, or having an ice pick of hard material securely fastened to it.1 When not projected from a throwing stick or shot from a bow the barbed harpoon is held in or hurled from the hand. In that event hand rests or offsets are lashed to the shaft near the center of gravity.”
Connecting line.—The connecting line of a barbed harpoon at first was only a bit of string or thong uniting the head to the shaft. If there be no connecting line between head and shaft, the weapon is called a rankling arrow, because the head stays in the animal and causes death. However, the rude Fuegian inventors have gotten beyond that, for the thong is carried halfway down the shaft and made fast here and there with knots. The same happy thought is called by Murdoch an ‘‘assembling: line,” since it serves in case of a break in the shaft to save the pieces. In the larger harpoons and the more delicate ones the assembling” line is a separate affair. The line of the more complicated barbed harpoons is fastened at one end through the line hole of the head. The other end is bifurcated, like the martingale of a bridle, or a kite string. One end of this martingale is tied to the shaft near the foreshaft, the other near the butt end of the shaft. When the harpoon is ready to be hurled the line is neatly rolled on the shaft, the head is placed in its socket, and a slipknot around the shaft takes the slack in the line. When the game is struck the head is pulled from its socket, the slipknot is released, and the line unrolls. The foreshaft being of bone, drops lowest in the water, so that the shaft acts as a drag. It serves also asa buoy, since the upper end, especially when feathered, bobs about over the water and shows the position of the game.
The feathering of the barbed harpoon is that of the arrow. Looking at this characteristic from the southward, the occurrence of feathers on the shafts of harpoons in lower Bering Sea is not abnormal. The float of the barbed harpoon is a small inflated bladder, stomach, or intestine attached to the side of the shaft, helping to keep the latter erect in the water. These structural elements are much more highly developed in the toggle series now to be studied. The barbed harpoon is of especial interest to the archeologist, who finds heads of bone or antler with holes and knobs or grooves for attaching the connecting line
and every variety of barb, in both shell heaps and cemeteries through~
out Canada and the United States.

Toggle head.—In describing a toggle harpoon head it is necessary to orient it, not that the Eskimo is known to have held any portion of the apparatus uppermost habitually, but for the sake of convenience in comparing different types and styles. However, Captain Herendeen informs the author that so far as his personal observation goes the barb of a toggle harpoon head, like the cock feather in an arrow, is held uppermost. (See fig. 1.)
To orient a toggle it must be placed with the barb or spur at the rear end uppermost, the point away from the observer. It will then be possible to speak of the top, back, or upper side; of the bottom, belly, or under side; of the right margin and the left margin; of the front or point; and of the butt end or rear. In those large examples, wherein there are right and left barbs in the rear, with the blade in the plane of the widest diameter of the body (Cat. Nos. 45947, 63948, 53950, figs. 34-50), the top may be distinguished from the bottom by means of the line hole, which runs in a bent course through the body.
The parts of a toggle head have been discussed by Mr. John Murdoch."
When the toggle head is oriented it will be seen that it is possible to speak of the following parts: Body, blade, blade slit or kerf, line hole, line grooves, barbs (side and rear), socket for _ Fig. 1.
4 x TYPE FORM OF TOGGLE HEAD. loose shaft, butt or rear end of the body, loose Be OF 1S shaft, blade line, loose-shaft loop or running conectea py Ludwig Kumlien. loop, head line or leader, ornamentations, and mabe Lie ee cc owner marks. Each one of these parts should be described and even its absence noted. The characteristics of these parts are as follows:
Body.—Its material, shape in outline and section, and dimensions.
Glade.—Its material, shape, relation to the body, whether a part of it or not; orientation, whether vertical or horizontal in the plane parallel with the line hole or across it.
Blade slit or kerf.—Whether saw cut or coarse; its orientation. The blade cover is frequently a case or cover for the entire toggle head.
‘Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.

<<<Page: 345>>>

Line hole.—The opening through the body of the toggle head for the rawhide sling or leader on which the toggle head hinges. In very modern examples and in the heads of small seal harpoons the hole is bored straight through, but in old specimens two much coarser holes are bored, one from each side of the belly inward and upward, meeting midway. All sharp edges within and without are carefully smoothed and rounded to protect the line and to facilitate the toggling. The points to be considered concerning the line hole are the shape, size, and method of boring, and its position with reference to the other parts of the toggle head. Line holes run directly through the narrow body type, but in a curved path through the belly of other types. In a few abnormal specimens it stands vertical, but in the great majority of examples it goes horizontally across the body. Holm figures toggle heads from east Greenland, in which the head is hinged to the foreshaft by means of a rivet.
Line grooves.—Gutters or channels extending backward from the line hole in which the rawhide line lies out of the way. In fact the line grooves are backward extensions of the line hole. Their width and depth have relation to the width and thickness of the rawhide line used. In old specimens they are wider and clumsier.
Barb or spur.—The projection backward ina toggle head at its butt end has for its function to catch into the flesh of the animal beneath the skin, so as to revolve the head ninety degrees, and thus to effect the toggling of the head in the wound, as in the fastening of a trace chain. In its way it is as important as the blade, and it will be seen that quite as much ingenuity has been spent on this part as on any other. If, for example, when the animal is struck, the spurs of the rear barb were covered by the rawhide line the head might not toggle; hence, ina toggle head of the old-fashioned type the line hole lies below the center of the mass. The entire projection of the toggle head back of the line hole may be called the spur to distinguish it from marginal barbs also sometimes present.
Shaft socket.—The socket is a conoidai excavation in the butt end of a toggle head, into which the forward end of the shaft or loose shaft fits loosely. It will be readily understood that the socket is centered as exactly as possible. There is little or no variation in this part except of size and neatness. When the toggle head has been thrust into a beast the foreshaft or the loose shaft must be withdrawn in order to allow the weapon to do its work.
Butt.—The butt or rear end of a toggle head is shaped in relation to the barb especially and also to the socket. In fact, the upper portion of the butt end is a part of the barb or spur. The exact method of shaping and treating this part seems to depend largely on the material, whether ivory, antler, or bone. The first named is solid, and the butt is acute angled above and sawed off square below. The other
a4 Ts —? Po

<<<Page: 346>>>

materials have more or less of spongy core or are hollow. In such examples the butt is mitered off with the acute angle at the barbs, and then scooped out and dished about the socket.
Blade line.—TYhis is wanting in a great many examples. It is a little twine of sinew extending from the inner left-hand corner of the blade, where it is looped into a small perforation, backward to the first wrapping of the leather sling or leader.
Leader or sling.—The toggle sling is a loop of rawhide thong or sinew twine, a foot, more or less, in length, passing through the line hole of the toggle head at one end and at the other end attached to the main line by means of a splice, toggle, or clasp, to be described later. The two ends of this sling are spliced or joined after the neatest and most elaborate Eskimo styles. At one or more points the two sides of the loop are Skee! united by wrapping (fig. 83). In the colleetions of the U. 8. National Museum the smaller harpoon heads with ° leaders are ee with sticks of pine wood on which the appa‘atus is kept stretched when not in action (fig. 84). In the great harpoons, as will be learned in the description of the line, there is no leader or sling to the toggle head, which is hinged at once onto a bend in the end of the main [ae Without the Mande line the movable head is only a rankling device. For instance, the loose head of many South American arrows, formed of a socketed bone of a monkey, remains in the wound, but not being attached to a line for retrieving it is not a harpoon head. The step between the two, however, is but a short one.
Loose shaft.—The part of a toggle harpoon which, at its forward end, fits into the socket of the head and in some way is hinged or joined to the foreshaft at its hinder end, as seen in figs. 2, 48, is called the loose shaft. The two varieties are the spindle-shaped and the conoidal. The former is joined on to leader or sling of the toggle head by a running loop or grommet (fig. 83); the latter is ape to the end of the shaft by a rawhide sioae! and makes a ball-and-socket joint (fig. 49). In either case the body of the loose shaft is perforated with one or more holes. When the toggle head is in place on the loose shaft the line is drawn taut, so that the loop or bone eyelet on the line may be buttoned over its peg on the shaft (fig. 79).
Writers on the Eskimo harpoon say that the kneejoint between the loose shaft and the foreshaft is to prevent the accidental breaking of the shaft. Captain Spicer gives additional functions to this structure of the implement. He says that it aids in the shipping and unshipping of the toggle head with reference to the loose shaft after the eyelet on the line is over its peg on the shaft. When an Eskimo hunter would prepare his harpoon for striking, he puts the eyelet which is attached to the line over the peg on the shaft, sets the loose shaft at an angle in the socket of the shaft, puts the toggle head in position, and

<<<Page: 347>>>

straightens up the loose shaft. This brings all taut for the stroke. As soon as the game is struck the shaft is pulled to one side by the movements of the animal, the loose shaft comes out of its socket and detaches itself from the toggle head. This enables the hunter to pull away his shaft easily and instantly.
Foreshaft.—The foreshaft of a harpoon is the working end of the shaft, and is usually 1 block of bone or ivory neatly fitted on. Foreshafts vary in material, being of antler, bone, ivory, or metal; in size and shape, from the delicate front of the sea-otter harpoon to the clumsy variety on the Greenland whaling harpoon; in the mode of attachment to the shaft, in the socket, and lashing for the loose shaft (see Plates 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18).
Shaft.—The shaft of the harpoon is of wood; in treeless areas, of driftwood, but in the north Pacific it is a long, slender pole of cedar. For the purpose of study, shafts have to be considered in relation to materials, shapes, and sizes; to hand stops or rests for thrusting; to line pegs, throwing stick pegs, assembling line, ete. For catching sea-otter the dart shaft is half an inch in diameter and 4 feet long, while some of the clumsy Greenland examples are 2 or 3 inches in diameter, and the east Greenland deep-water variety

papa es The shaft has the double functior
of stabbing and retrieving. For the former (1) it may be thrust at the
victim, in which case, in order to give a firmer grasp, a projecting
piece of wood or bone or ivory is fastened near the center of gravity
to stop the hand. Near this is frequently found a peg, over which is-
hooked the line to hold the head firmly on to the loose shaft. (2) It
may be thrown as a javelin from the hands. (3) It may be hurled
from a throwing stick. This method will be more fully described in a

special paper. The series begins with the plain shaft, and includes the hand-rest type, the throwing stick type, the Giliak long pole and floating-head type, the east Greenland sled-point type, the east Greenland deep-sea shaft type, and the Amazon type, in which the throwing stick is cast overboard.
By the function of retrieving is meant recovering the game after it has been struck. For this purpose the shaft is in many cases thrown overboard, and, being attached by one end of the line, while the other is tied to the harpoon head in the animal, acts as a drag and a buoy to impede the progress of the animal and to show its position.
Ice pick.—On the butt end of the harpoon shaft may be found, in arctic examples, a long ivory pick for enlarging a hole in the ice in
-orderto remove the game. This is replaced with a boat-hook arrangement in others. Types of the butt end of the shaft exist in the forms following:
1. The plain butt, without function.
2. The feathered end, akin to the arrow.
3. The socketed end, for throwing stick.
4, The Greenland type, with ivory feathering.
5. The pick.
6. The carved pick, Nunivak type, on lances with loose heads.
Nansen ' traces the elaborate Greenland harpoon shaft, with its many accessories, thus:
1. The Indian arrow, with its variety of feathering.
2. The feathered harpoon darts in southeastern Alaska.
3. Farther north the disappearance of the feather and the occurrence of the small bladder on the shaft.
4. The harpoon, with line and skin float, the last named being detached from the shaft and attached to the head. ;
Line.—The line of the harpoon also has had its peculiar elaboration, answering to external exigencies and opportunities on the one hand, and to the ingenuity of the savage on the other. The Fuegian sinew thread, a few inches long, is far away from the Greenland whale line, and a series would take some such order as the following:
1. The Fuegian type, short sinew cord tied around both the head and the shaft.
2. The western Eskimo type, line tied to head and middle of shaft.
3. Martingale type, attached to shaft in two places.
4, With skin float, head fastened to line.
5. Entirely separate, with ivory or bone toggles for fastening to the leader strap of the head and to the float.
The harpoon line developed a deal of ingenuity in the textile art. Shredded sinew, thread, twine, and braid or sennit are in demand
constantly. Rawhide line in great variety is also a necessity.

<<<Page: 349>>>

Here also originated the whole scheme of knots and splices, as will be abundantly shown in the illustrations that follow. The Eskimo made a button or frog on the end of a rawhide line by cutting a slit near the end and doubling the end back through the slit. They were extremely neat and skillful in fastening off lashings. Boas and Murdoch have given special attention to the Kskimo knots.
With the line, in its highest estate, go certain accessories, such as the eyelet, for making fast to a peg on the shaft (fig. 3), the line rack on the kaiak, and a multitude of ingenious inventions which Nelson calls ‘*detachers,” since they make it possible in the frozen Arctic for the hunter to take his apparatus apart under the most trying circumstances.
In order to prevent the line from getting out of order, a swivel is sometimes used. One brought from Cumberland Sound by Kumlien and described by him is represented in fig. 4+. There
Fig. 3. was a ball in the hollow body of this instrument, ae Cumberland Seanad. Which could not be pulled through any of the

ater ree ee passing through the central hole, and another
one to the top of the swivel. A simpler pattern
is represented by Boas,' in which the ball in the socket would be a spherical knot on the end of the line.
Floats. —The sealskin bag used as a float on the end of the line of the harpoon for killing whale and beluga is in Unaleet dgait ik, bag; in Malemut A¥et nuk: the float, in bath dialects, is Oi tuk. Nelson describes two sizes. The smaller one is fastened to the line after the beluga has become unable to struggle much. The large float which has tired the beluga is at the end of the line. This small one is gradually slipped nearer by the man in the kaiak until it is distant 4+ or 5 feet, when the cowp is made and the prey
secured. Boas describes and figures examples from Fig. 4. 1 > ~ 2 LINE SWIVEL. Cumberland Sound (figs. 5, 6). Cumberland Sound.

Besides the hundred and one parts of the harpoon immediately attached to it there are unlimited accessories which have been called into existence at its demands. The hunter has a peculiar costume which he puts on when he goes harpooning. Certain kinds of food are demanded; a multitude of charms and lore are inseparable from the implement. In addition, the hunter takes along several devices to gain information, to decoy the game, and to add to his own comfort. All about the American coast where great fish or mammals existed the water craft were improved immensely. The Nutka dugout canoes and the Eskimo kaiak are unrivaled, and they are the ministers of the harpoon. In like manner the sled, the dog, the harness, the shifting tent owe their forms and usefulness to the ingenious mind which devised and perfected the harpoon, which is no doubt the most virile of all savage inventions.
Sometimes a small implement is used in the hunt to indicate the approach of the seal. It is called qipekutang, and consists of a very thin

rod with a knob or a knot at one end.’ It is stuck through the snow, the end passing into the water, the knob resting on the snow. As soon as the seal rises to blow, it strikes the rod, which, by its movements, warns the hunter. Generally it is made of whale’s bone. Sometimes a string is attached to the knob and fastened by a pin to the snow, as its movements are more easily detected than those of the knob. The natives are somewhat averse to using this implement, as it frequently scares the seals.”
When watching for a seal at his breathing hole, the Point Barrow native inserts into the hole a rod of ivory. When the seal rises, it pushes up this rod and thus warns the hunter when to shoot or to harpoon * (fig. 7).

tance between the head and the float. A collection of these from different areas would form an interesting study. The extreme cold of the region, stiffening the line and freezing the hands of the fisherman, makes it necessary to have some device which renders the rapid shipping and unshipping of the line certain and easy. In the example here shown the detacher is carved in the shape of a seal’s head. The leader passes through the hole drilled in the neck of the animal, while the line to be attached is looped and pushed through the mouth of the seal, around a stud on top of the head, and hooked. While this attachment is secure enough where there is a steady strain, the hunter has only to push the loop backward, when it relieves itself from the button or stud and can easily be withdrawn.

object, the curved line or serrate ornament, the owner mark on the back of the head, and the existence of the dot and circle ornament for eyes and on the button or side.
Figures 40 and 41, pages 144 and 145, in Nelson (1900), are good illustrations of this type.
Cat. No. 45060 (fig. 10) in the U. S. National Museum is a seal decoy from Sledge Island, collected by E. W. Nelson. It consists of a handle of pine wood rudely carved at the butt end to resemble the face of a seal, and at the other end into three prongs. Upon each one of these prongs is fitted a toe of a seal so that the three points will touch the same surface. Around
ach of these is wrapped, by half hitches, a continuous thread of sinew and loops passing around a jog or projection on the end of a stud in the handle just where it is pronged. This stud, of walrus ivory, has carved at the other extremity the head of a seal, the eyes, ears, and nostrils indicated by insertions of black substance like whalebone. The use of this, it is said by those who have traveled in Alaska, is to scratch upon the ice in order to imitate the noise made by the male seal and thereby attract his mate. On hearing the noise above, the seal that is under the ice comes to the breathing hole and is soon dispatched by the hunter.

similar device from Cape Nome, Alaska, south of Bering Strait. After the seal is struck with the harpoon down through the small breathing hole, it is necessary to enlarge the opening in order to withdraw the body of the animal. This is done with the pick on the butt end of the harpoon. As soonas the opening is large enough the hunter proceeds to remove the broken ice at once by means of a scoop, the essential parts of which are the handle, the bow, and the webbing. In the example from Schrenk here figured the very primitive way of attaching the spoon to the handle is worthy of notice. The spoon is kite-

<<<Page: 357>>>

shaped in form, the butt ends crossing and lashed to the handle a little above the lower ends, which rest underneath a short bit of wood or across the spoon at either end by means of a rawhide thong. The examples of this apparatus are figured in Nelson, Murdoch, and Boas.
Among the accessories to the harpoon, the throwing stick or board, called atlatl by the Mexicans, must not be omitted. True, the cunning device was used all around the Pacific Ocean and across the Arctic for projecting spears as well as harpoons, and there are other methods of using the harpoon effectively; but the elaboration of the atlatl throughout was greatly stimulated by association with the harpoon. The proper discussion and illustration of this accessory, however, would far exceed the limitations of this article, and will therefore be reserved for a separate paper. <A map showing the distribution of the atlatl in the Western Hemisphere would be marked on Greenland, Labrador, Baffin Land, Mackenzie River, all about Alaska to British

The continent of South America was not favorable to the harpoon. Most of its shores descend at once
into the inhospitable deep sea. Except at its narrow and bleak coast southward, animals best captured with the harpoon did not abound. Inland there were pampas and forests, better suited to bolas, spears, slings, blow tubes, and the bow. It is in the Straits of Magellan, on the west coast, and in the open waters of the great rivers that a rude barbed harpoon and excellent harpoon arrows existed. Nor can the thought be slighted that outside of the favored Cordilleras, the luxuriance of nature overpowered the inventive faculty, which indeed is developed among difficulties so long

as there is hope, but gives way to despair when nature even by her
riches shuts the door against invention. This part of the South American Indian’s equipment was not of a high order, since his patent which he received for his cunning was so meager.
Fuegian type.—About the Straits of Magellan are three linguistic families of Indians—the Onan, the Alikulufan, and the Yahgan. The first named are believed to be closely related to their neighbors, the Patagonians of the mainland. The other two families make canoes of bark and live on sea products. Their inventions, aside from their ingenious canoes, are not of ahigh order. Since the days of Magellan, 1520, until now, they have been spectators of Caucasian activities, yet they adhere to their ancient forms and are among the lowliest of the tribes now on the earth.
In the Fuegian barbed harpoons the transition from the spear is immediate, for it is only a matter of a short piece of sinew string or leather thong uniting the head with the shaft. If the barbed head of bone be firmly fixed in the split end of the shaft, the implement is a spear; if the barbed head fit loosely by its butt into a socket or, what is really the case, into the riven end of the shaft, and is joined to the shaft by a short cord or thong, as is shown in fig. 12 (Cat. No. 79091, U.S.N.M.), the implement is the most primitive of harpoons. The transition is not only immediate but easy. When the end of the shaft is merely split to hold the tang of the long bone spearhead, it is impossible to make a rigid joint by any amount of wrapping.
In the examples studied for this paragraph, collected by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer A/hitross, the spearheads have many serrate barbs on one edge of the blade, and the tangs, instead of being smooth and tapering, are roughly notched to prevent the head from being drawn out of the end of the shaft (Plate 2). In like manner the harpoon heads of bone have tapering points of greater or less length, with two large barbs, one on each side, or one barb projecting near the base. In spears the tang is not fitted neatly into a socket at the end of the shaft, but the latter is merely split and bound with sinew or thong; but the open socket for the harpoon head

more care. The Fuegian harpoon is thrust with both hands or thrown. It has no hand rest on the shaft to make the blow more effective, nor did these natives have knowledge of the harpoon arrow or the throwing stick, a device prevalent in many other parts of America for propelling the harpoon. The shaft as now seen is a creditable part of the implement, being often 12 feet long and cut out with eight sides rather than round. The thong also is carefully knotted to the shaft a few feet from the barbed head, its length nicely adjusted to the setting of the harpoon for action.
Chilean type.—On the Atlantic slope from the Straits of Magellan to the mouth of the Rio Negro, the bow and arrow (formerly), the long-handled spear, but, more than all others, the different varieties of bolas, were the hunting implements. ‘To find the harpoon it will be necessary to cross the Cordilleras and visit the archipelagos of the Pacitic coast. Here amidst the greatest abundance, having little contact with Europeans, the tribes of Aucanian and those of unknown affinities plied a harpoon not much in advance of those of Fuegia (fig. 13C’). It is toall intents and purposes a good North American arrow, chipped head, foreshaft, lashing crossed over the barbs of the head, and conical base for making a joint with the shaft.
Fig. 13, A and B represent barbed harpoon heads in the U.S. National Museum from Arica, Peru. The heads are of chipped stone set by a tang into a socket in the end of its foreshaft or tang and bound with fine string. The column of the foreshaft is cylindrical, terminating below in a bulb, which serves both to hold the connecting line and to make a loose joint with the shaft.
In the Blake collections, Peabody Museum, is a similar barbed harpoon from Chacota, Peru, with point or blade of stone, tang of wood, and with conical butt end to fit in a socket.’ Comparing these examples with the Fuegian type, the great advantage which one people may have over another caused by differences of material is apparent. The Fuegian, in order to join the head with the shaft of the harpoon, knows nothing better than to split the front of the handle and make the joining as secure as possible by lashing with rawhide, or sinew cord, which shrinks in drying. Soon, however, this becomes loose again, and makes it necessary to repeat the process of fastening. It is a poor joint at best. As soon as the fisherman, coming northward, discovers the tough and straight cane, a new device is possible, and a better joint. Indeed, nature bores the hole regular in form for the butt end of the harpoon head. By cutting the stem of the cane just above the joint an ideal socket is effected. When the harpoon head is set securely into this socket and the outside wrapped with stout thread, the best of joints is effected. The butt end of all South Ameri-

<<<Page: 363>>>

lower end of the wooden tang there is a projection for a cord which fastened the head to the upper end of a shaft or reed cane. The lower end of the tang is conical, to fit into the end of the cane. There is a rudeness about the Peruvian and Chilean harpoon heads worthy of attention. The better classes of this ancient people were skillful in many arts. There is in these appliances of capture, therefore, evidence of a humble fishing caste, or of a tribe not identical with Aymaras and Kechuas. The spirit of invention was not entirely wanting in this area, however, as /) and £} fig. 13, show. The last named is taken from Charles Read’s paper in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute (volume xix, page 60). Side barbs are set on the side of the wooden tang of the head, partly let in, partly cemented, and in one example served. All the elements here rudely put together will again appear on this same Pacific coast at its northern extremity in their latest elaboration.
In the Hassler collection of the Field Columbian Museum are barbed harpoons from southern Brazil. The bone of an animal forms the point anda barbed piece of hard wood the tang of the head, which is attached by a short piece of rope to the end of the long shaft. In some examples the bone is socketed and set on the end of the tang; in others a spindle-shaped bone is lashed diagonally to the beveled end of the tang. Attention is here specially invited to the bone which forms the body and blade of this head, because it is an ideal, if not the real, beginning of all toggle heads of harpoons. A short piece of bone, conical in form, is cut out so as to be sharp in front and cup-shaped in the rear. If this is set on the end of a hard wood foreshaft and driven into the body of a fish or other animal it remains there and rankles. The arrow shaft is withdrawn, but if the bone be tied to the shaft it becomes a retriever. It toggles in the body of the game. The attachment of spurs at the base of this head brings about the made-up toggle head of the north Pacific coast.
The turtle harpoon arrow in the Solimoens, Brazil, has a lancetshaped point of steel fitted into a peg, which enters the tip of the shaft. This head is secured to the shaft by a twine of pineapple fiber, 30 to 40 yards long and neatly wound around the shaft. When the blade enters the shell the head of the arrow pulls out and the animal dives to the bottom, leaving the shaft floating. The Indian, on perceiving a movement in the water, shoots his arrow into the air and it never fails to pierce the shell of the submerged animal.*
The Amazon Indians hunt the manatee for food in small canoes and kill it with harpoons, the blades of which are made of shells.”
The Upper Shingu tribes hunted and fished with bow and arrow, though fishing was sparingly done in this way. The harpoon arrows

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN HARPOONS. yA iy
of the Bororo Indians of the headwaters of the Paraguay River, in southwestern Brazil, are used for capturing alligators and large fish. The shaft is of the Uba reed, and at the butt end has two whole feathers laid on flat. The head consists of a shaft of hard wood about 2 feet long, to which are fastened the point and barb, made of a piece of bone or very hard wood, sharpened at both ends, and laid on the top of the foreshaft diagonally so as to form the piercing portion in front and the hook in the rear. The barb is lashed on to the foreshaft by means of a twined string, the other end of -which is attached to the shaft, so that when the head is drawn out the shaft itself serves as a buoy. For about 2 feet the outer end of the reed shaft is wrapped with the same cord that connects the reed with the shaft. The inner end of the foreshaft fits into the hole of the reed (fig. 14). Length of this spear, 6 feet. It is pictured in Von den Steinen, 1894, page 484. " Among the Bororo (Tupian family) is to be found a modification of this type of harpoon in which the shaft is not fastened to the line but held in the hand of the fisherman, who dives after his game. A harpoon arrow of the Venezuelan Indians is shown in Plate 3. The specimen is in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania. The shaft is of reed, without a joint. At the shaftment there are two half feathers set on radially and held in place by wrappings of black and white thread in alternate bands. In a few places the thread passes over the shaft of the quill, and elsewhere the bands of thread do not touch the feather and have nothing to do with the lashing. At the nock, a ball-like projection is formed by the wrapping of thread. A piece of hard wood is inserted in the notch to fit through the bowstring. At the front end of the shaft a similar object is wrapped around the end to strengthen the socket of the foreshaft, which is a reed of black palm about 8 inches in length, sharpened at its lower end, and driven into the reed. It tapers gradually SiN Heat toward the fore end, where it fits into the head. srter von den Steinen. The head consists of a barbed point of iron and a socket piece or a shank of wood, into which the iron is fitted. At the base of this shank is a short wrapping of twine, mixed with gum, resembling a turk’s-head knot. This acts as a stop to the line. The same wrapping extends from the line outward nearly to the barb on the point. The harpoon line, which is 10 feet in length, is

tied around the head at one end and at the top of the shaft at the other end. When this weapon is set ready for action, the barbed head is placed on the end of the foreshaft. The line having been wrapped neatly around the top of the shaft, almost to its end, a loop or slip-knot is formed at the last turn, and drawn tight. . When the game is struck, the head is withdrawn, the slip-knot untied, the line unwound, and the heavy portion of the shaft drops into the water, the feather projects into the air, and the apparatus acts both as a drag and as a signal. Excepting the iron point, which might easily be replaced by one of bone, the whole apparatus is aboriginal, and the wide prevalence of this particular combination of parts leads to the belief that we have here an early and unchanged American harpoon arrow. It is interesting also from the point of view before mentioned, that it is a step in the progress of the toggle head. If a Columbia River Indian were to fasten a spur on the end of the cup-shaped socket, the combined barbed and toggle heads, to be more fully illustrated and described, would be realized. This form of harpoon head, in which the socket is on the movable part instead of being in the end of the shaft, is quite well diffused in the Amazon drainage and on the Pacific coast. It is not found in the shell heaps or mounds of eastern United States, but is common in western Canada and universal among the Eskimo.
The harpoon arrows of the tribes in British Guiana are used for shooting fish, pacu (acu myletes), which abound at all seasons of the year, according to Im Thurn, in most of the large rivers of Guiana. When the river is high and the water is turbid with rain the pacu are distributed equally in all parts of the stream and are almost invisible. When, however, in the dry season, the river is low and the water clear, when the rocks which form the rapids are partially uncovered, and the ‘‘pacu grass,” a small water plant (Zac7s), which clothes these rocks, comes into flower, then the pacu collect at the falls to feed on the leaves. Large numbers of Indians then camp at the sides of the falls to shoot these fish. Such a scene is highly picturesque. The place is generally a wide extent of river bed, apparently inclosed by the forested banks, and entirely occupied by a curious confusion of rocks and white, rushing water. On a rock in the midst of, and almost covered by the tumbling water, stands an Indian, his feet crushing the delicate, star shaped, pink flowers of the lacis, and every muscle in his naked, cinnamon-colored body bearing witness to the intensity of his watch. His bow is half drawn, the arrow is in position, but its point rests idly on the rocks. ‘The water is rushing and tumbling so wildly that an unpracticed eye can see nothing beiow its surface. But the Indian sees. Quickly the bow is raised, the aim is taken, the arrow flies, and its shaft is there, dancing and tumbling in the water, carried here and there by the terrified rushes of an unseen pacu, in the body of which the arrowhead is embedded. But

<<<Page: 368>>>

the line not only connects arrowhead and arrow shaft, but its other end is held firmly in the hands of the Indian, who now easily hauls the tish on to the rock. Sometimes, instead of waiting on a rock, in his eagerness he stands in the midst of the almost overwhelming rush of the water, stooping, the better to resist its force. In either case, if he is skillful, he gets a large number of fish. Im Thurn saw 15 pacu, averaging about 7 or 8 pounds in weight, shot by one man in twenty minutes. When enough have been taken the Indian loads his canoe and returns to his temporary camp. The fish are then cut open and cleaned, their sides are slit again and again, salt is rubbed in, and they are put on the rocks to dry in the sun.
It is not, however, only in the falls that the Indian shoots fish, though he rarely gets pacu elsewhere. In the smooth reaches of the river he shoots others of various kinds. Indeed, he can almost always and everywhere find fish to shoot, and he seldom fails to hit them when they are once seen. When the water is smooth two other fish arrows are used. Of these one’ differs from the harpoon before mentioned in that a short line connects only the head—which in this case also is slipped on to the shaft—and the shaft, instead of being carried on the arm of the shooter. The struggles of the fish when hit immediately cause the shaft to slip out of the head, and the former, which is very long and light, floats on the top of the water, but remains connected with the fish by the line, and so serves as a buoy and marks the position of the fish.*
Between the northern and the southern continents of the Western Hemisphere the mode of communication was by land or by water. By land the dividing line between North and South America was very near the route of the projected Nicaraguan Canal. The gold-working Chibchas of British Columbia had as their northern boundary the San Juan River. By water there was no partition between the continents. The Caribian and the Arawakan tribes encountered by Spanish explorers all about the Caribbean Sea were also found away southward in the Orinoco drainage and farther. There will be no surprise, therefore, on finding the same devices of capture widely distributed. The same animal will be killed in many places with similar harpoons,. because in the struggle for survival among weapons this or that form proved the fittest; also because of that subtle, imaginary kinship between men and animals of prey which encourages the man to follow animals of particular species. The barbed head, with tang fitting into a socket at the end of the shaft, and the socketed head, whose cup-shaped base fits on to a pointed foreshaft, continue to exist with little change until
"Im Thurn, Among the Indians of British Guiana, 1883, p. 235, fig. 9b. *Idem., pp. 235-237.

<<<Page: 369>>>

California is reached. The barbed harpoon head with cup-shaped base there takes on spurs and becomes a toggle head without barbs.
Of harpoons on the Mosquito coast of Nicaragua and Honduras Squier says:
The women were left on the beach and three men apportioned to each boat—a paddler, a torch bearer, and a striker. Torches made of pine splinters; spears of two kinds—one (sinnock) fixed by a shank at the end of along, light pole and kept in the hand; the other (waisko-dusa) shorter, staff hollow, iron-barbed head, fastened to a line passing through rings by the side of the shaft, wound to a light wood float. When thrown the head remains in the fish, the line unwinds, the float rises to the surface to be seized by the fisherman, who hauls in his fish at leisure.!
The same author says that the Mosquito Indians capture thousands of turtles with harpoons.
The Ulva Indians, of Bluefields Lagoon, pursue the manatee. One man sits in the stern of a flat-bottomed dugout (pitpan) to steer, one crouches in the bow with a harpoon, the rest kneel on the bottom, lances in hand. The boat is covered with boughs to resemble floating trees. The man at the bow launches his harpoon, the animal makes a plunge, the boughs are thrown overboard, and the lance men make ready. The bowsman gradually hauls in his line and the animal, after some maneuvering, comes to the surface, where it is stabbed with a lance. After a series of struggles it is secured.” These processes of paddling, harpooning, throwing the boughs overboard, hauling in the line, and stabbing with the lance may be carefully noted, in prospect of coming descriptions relating to harpoon work by the Eskimo.
Clavigero describes the Mexican tlacochtli or dart, a small lance of otalli or some other strong wood, the point of which was hardened by fire or shod with copper, or itzli, or bone, and many of them had three points. The Mexicans fixed a string to their darts in order to pull them back again. This weapon was especially dreaded by the Spaniards.* The line affixed to the darts is a harpoon characteristic. The three-pronged barbed harpoon’ head is also to be seen on Lake Patzcuaro at present.
A turtle harpoon! of the Seri Indians of Tiburon Island, in the Gulf of California and the mainland adjoining, is shown in fig. 15. It comprises a point 3 or 4 inches long, made from a nail or bit of stout wire, rudely sharpened by hammering the tip (cold) between cobbles, and dislodging the loosened scales and splinters by thrusts and twirlings in the ground; this is set firmly and cemented with mesquite gum into a foreshaft of hard wood, usually 4 or 5 inches long, notched to receive a cord and rounded at the inner end. This rounded end fits into a socket of the main shaft, which may be either a cane stalk or a section

of mesquite root, while a stout cord is firmly knotted about the tang of the head and either attached to the outer end of the main shaft or carried in the hand of the user. The shaft is usually 10 or 12 feet long, with the socket in the larger end, and is manipulated by a fisherman sitting or standing on his balsa. On catching sight of a turtle lying in the water, he approaches stealthily, preferably from the rear, yet in such wise as not to cast a frightening shadow, sets the foreshaft in place, guides the point close to the victim, and then by a quick thrust drives the metal through the shell. The resistance between the turtle shell and the metal holds the point in place, and although the head is jerked out at the first movement, of the animal, the cord prevents escape; and after partial tiring, the turtle is either drowned or driven ashore, or else lifted on the craft. Dr. McGee quotes the following minute account of Seri turtle capture: '
An Indian paddles himself from the shore on one of these by means of a long elastic pole of about 12 or 14 feet in length, the wood of which is the root of a thorn called mesquite, growing. near the coast; and although the branches of this tree are extremely brittle, the underground roots are as pliable as whalebone and nearly as dark in color. At one end of this pole there is a hole an inch deep, into which is inserted another bit of wood in shape like an acorn, having a square bit of iron 4 inches long fastened to it, the other end of the tree being pointed. Both the ball and cup are first moistened and then tightly inserted one within the other. Fastened to the iron is a cord of very considerable length, which is brought up along the pole, and both are held in the left hand of the Indian. So securely is the nail thus fixed in the pole that although the latter is used as a paddle it does not fall out.
A turtle is a very lethargic animal,and may frequently be surprised in its watery slumbers. The balsa is placed nearly perpendicularly over one of these unsuspecting sleepers, when the fisherman, softly sliding the pole through the water in the direction of the animal till within a foot or two of it, suddenly plunges the iron into its back. No sooner does the creature feel itself transfixed than it swims hastily forward and endeavors to liberate itself. The slightest motion of the turtle displaces the iron point from the long pole, which would otherwise be inevitably broken and the turtle would as certainly be lost; but in the manner here described it is held by the cord fastened on to the iron which has penetrated its back, till, after it has sufliciently exhausted its strength, it is hoisted on board the canoe by the fisherman, who proceeds to the shore in order to dispose of his prize.
A barbed head, with wooden shaft, together forming a turtle spearhead, is shown in fig. 16, by McGee (1898, p. 193).
The only approach to the harpoon type in all the Pueblo region is an insignificant apparatus for capturing vermin. But the cliff dwellers had the throwing stick, and a spear with a head of stone set ona tang of wood conical at its inner end, like so many found in Peru and Chile. The Yokut Indians (Mariposan family) on Tulare Lake, California, are said by Powers to erect brushwood shelters over the water, in which the Indian lies flat on his belly peering down through

harpoon (1877, p. 376). No other region in America illustrates more aptly what has been previously said about the dependence of cultureprogress on the bounty of nature. The Tulare women are among the most skillful basket makers in the world, and their ware is sought far and wide. The material is at hand. But the Tulare men have reduced the harpoon to its lowest terms, for two reasons—the animals requiring a better perfected implement are not at hand, and the materials for constructing the weapon are not forthcoming.
The Indians of the Sacramento Valley, in California, not being subjected to the prohibition of the game laws, are allowed to capture game at any season of the year, and when the salmon are in the river to spawn they take them by means of toggle harpoons, one of which is nearly 25 feet in length.
The Sacramento near its head is very swift, and in its passage across different ledges of various degrees of softness excavates large pools or holes in its bed, each having a small fall, and there is a rapid beyond. The water in these holes, which are often very large, is comparatively still, and they make welcome resting places for the tired salmon before they attempt the passage of the rapid above. The water is beautifully cold and clear, and the fish can be seen crowding together on the bottom. The Indians repair to one of these holes to the number of twenty or more. Some station themselves at the rapids above and below; others wade out to an isolated rock,

which is detached from the harpoon head and thrown on the bank. The harpoons, having toggles of steel which become detached from the stock when they enter the fish, and being attached to the shaft by cords, turn flat against the fish’s side and make escape impossible when the salmon is pierced through. Sometimes three or four hundred are thus harpooned from one pool.'. The Wintun

Indian ties two poles together near one end, sets them in deep water near the shore, the bottoms a few feet apart; on this he sets a log, one end resting on the shore. From this fishing station he harpoons the black-backed salmon. The shaft is often 15 feet long; the head, a : joint of deer’s bone, is 3 inches long, with socket to fit on the end of the foreshaft and line tied about its middle. This head is driven quite through the fish and toggles on the other side. The reader can not fail to recall the toggle heads of bone in the heart of Brazil. The Yurok also spear salmon from booths with toggle harpoons.' The Wintuns belong to Powell’s Copehan family. They are skillful arrow makers and their women dainty weavers of twined basketry. But the abundance of the game as well as its accessibility have acted here, as in all other places, to deter the inventive faculty. The thrusting of a toggle quite through a fish was indeed an effective mode of capture, but it did little to elevate the mind of the captor.

two barbs laid alongside, lashed down, and covered with pitch. (Fig. 17.) In the same lashing is included one end of the leader, a short strap of deer rawhide. Into a slit at the other end is spliced the line, a piece of rope from 1 to 3 feet long, attached at its opposite end to the side of the shaft. Some spears have two or more prongs, each armed with one of these toggle heads. When the fish is struck its struggles detach the toggle head and it is retrieved by means of the line and pole. Toggle heads of similar type are in use among all the salmon-eating Indians of northwest California.*
In the figure shown will be seen the transition of the rankling arrow head of South America intoa toggle head. There must be point, barbs, or spurs, line attached between ends, and socket in every harpoon. In this noteworthy type the point and the flukes or barbs are separate, and the socket is ingeniously effected by the combination of point, spurs, and rawhide leader.
The spring salmon, says Gibbs, are taken on the rivers Sacramento, Klamath, Columbia, and Kwinaiutl with a harpoon, the points or barbs attached loosely by a thong, so as to give play to the fish. On some of the rivers, where the depth permits, weirs are built to stop their ascent.”
The relationship of weirs, dams, and stops of various kinds with the harpoon may be mentioned in this connection, since the California and Oregon tribes, barred out from ocean fishing by absence of archipelagoes, were compelled to invent equivalents. The old-time harpoon was even then adequate, but engineering schemes were stimulated and so the intellect was quickened. The cooperative results in dam building, strengthening as they did the social tie, are not to be despised. Indeed, Powers, who knew those tribes half a century ago, has much to say about their manliness and resource, both in fishing and hunting. The same will be found true not only on the Atlantic side of the United States but on both sides of South America.
It must not be overlooked that the Pacific Ocean all along the Mexican and Californian coast was no friend to the canoe. Fishing was done inland. The coastal plain, indeed, was the pasture land of vast marine herds that needed no shepherds, but at the proper season they rounded themselves up and proceeded into the various open streams to their spawning grounds, where they were slaughtered without mercy and in such way as to awaken little thought in the minds of their captors.
Cat. No. 131358 in the U. S. National Museum is a barbed head of a harpoon from the Nal-tunne-tunne Indians, Oregon, collected by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, consisting of an iron arrow head with long sharp barbs on each side and a wooden shank barb piece having two unilateral

flukes (fig. 18). On this wooden shank, the butt end of which fits loosely into the socket of the shaft, is a projection to hold the string connecting head and shaft. This tribe of Indians belong, as their name shows, to the Déné or Tinné Indians, whose home is in central Alaska and the western portion of the Dominion of Canada. This Athapascan family is represented on the Pacific coast also by the Hupa, Wailaki, Saiaz, and many other tribes given by Powell (1891, p. 55). The time of their migration is not known, but extensive movements have taken place since the coming of the whites. They have added nothing to the inventions of the locality. The barbed harpoon blade, with barbs also on its shank, is widespread. Sixty years ago Wilkes described harpooning at Walla Walla, on the Columbia River, as very much like that at Willamette Falls, except there is no necessity for planks to stand on. ‘The Indians use hooks and spears attached to long poles, both of which are made to unship readily and are attached to the pole by a line 4 feet below its upper end. If the hook were made permanently fast to the end of the pole, it would be liable to break and the large fish more difficult to take. The Indians are seen standing along the walls of the canals in great numbers fishing. It is not uncommon for them to take twenty or twenty-five salmon in an hour.t Wilkes brought home one of their harpoon heads, which is combined barbed and toggle, made up as follows: The head is of iron, triangular in shape, with a large barb on one side. The shank is set in

One of the oldest pieces in the U. 8S. National Museum, Cat. No. 1439, collected by Lieutenant Whipple, is of similar type, only there is not a bit of iron about it. So far as its materials and form are concerned, it might have come down from aboriginal times. The blade is of bone, having two large flukes or barbs on one side cut out. In this example also the spurs at the butt end, which form the toggle, are of bone. The leader joining the head to the shaft is a strap of rawhide. The blade, spurs, and line or leader are neatly joined together with thread and pitch, so as to provide a socket for the end of the shaft.

Those who understand the difficulties which beset the savage artisan in making a good joint will appreciate this efficient combination.
The Twana Indians, of Washington State, make one kind of salmon hook of a straight piece of steel about 6 inches long, and sharp. On each side of it pieces of bone are tied. A line is attached and also a pole 15 or 20 feet long, in such a way that by means of the pole it may be driven into the fish, the pole drawn out, and the hook remain, held by the string, when it is drawn in.!
They (the Twana) sometimes use harpoons for seal fishing. The point is of iron, and the spear and line used as with the salmon hook just described.”
The shaft of the Quinaielt salmon harpoon is made of cedar, the fork of the wood of the salmon berry; the toggle heads of wood or metal.

The loop of cord, which is 16 feet long, is for the left hand. The length of the spear is nearly 16 feet. This spear is used on the bar of the river at low water.’ This most interesting specimen recalls the heart of Brazil. There a short piece of monkey’s bone was pointed in front, while nature formed the socket at the base to fit over the foreshaft. In the Quinaielt specimen the monkey bone is replaced by a combination of bone and metal, the cup-shaped cavity at the base fits also over the foreshaft, but a short line or leader passes from the middle of the head to the fore end of the shaft. This is a full-fledged toggle harpoon of a primitive type (fig. 19). .
The Indians of Neah Harbor, says Wilkes, capture the whale with a buoy made of a seal’s skin, which is blown up after the manner of bladder, forming a large oblong float. These floats are 4 feet long by 18 inches or 2 feet in diameter, and are made fast by a rope to the harpoon or spear which is thrown at the whale, and becoming fastened to it pre-—

vent its diving down to any great depth. After having a number of these joined to it the animal is unable to quit the surface and is finally captured.
All those whose sealskin floats are attached to the animal now divide the booty. Those who are entitled to a share are easily known, for each float has a different pattern printed upon it.’
From Vancouver Island around the interminable coasts of North America to eastern Greenland the float is only in a few places absent from the harpoon in some form. It may be, as in this example, the hide of an immense seal, perhaps of a smaller seal, elsewhere a bladder or intestine inflaced. On the coast of British Columbia, in the absence of sealskins, the unconquerable genius of invention substitutes a large bag or wallet of cedar bark, and the Labrador Eskimo attaches a bit of plank to the butt end of his harpoon shaft. The motive is the same. A huge animal, to be captured, must not only be stabbed, but held back by an unwearying device which takes the place of the hunter’s hand ana arm.
The Makah, living on the northwestern point of Washington State, pursue the whale in their dugout canoes. On one occasion, says George Gibbs, a canoe was gone five days. Their tackle consists of a harpoon, the point formerly edged with shell, now usually with copper, very firmly secured to a line and attached lightly to a shaft about 15 feet long, to which. also the line is made fast; a sealskin float is attached to another line and serves to buoy the whale when struck. The scene of the capture is described by eyewitnesses as very exciting, ten canoes being sometimes engaged, the crews yelling and dashing their paddles with frantic eagerness. When taken, the whale, buoyed up with floats, is towed in triumph to the village and cut up.”
The Makahs belong to the Wakashan family, whose chief abode is on the outer side of Vancouver Island. They are the Nutkas of Captain Cook and of the early explorers. But in this connection they are at the gateway of the North Pacific archipelago, where, after a lonesome search stretching from Magellan Straits, the student encounters the Caribs of the west. One after another Wakashan, Salishan, Haidah, or Skiddegatan and Tlinket, or Koloschan come out to meet him in their graceful dugouts of cedar.
The Makah whaling harpoon consists of a barbed head, to which is attached a rope or lanyard, always of the same length, about 5 fathoms, or 30 feet. This lanyard is made of whale’s sinews twisted into a rope about an inch and a half in circumference and covered with twine wound around it very tightly, called by sailors ** serving.”
The harpoon head is a flat piece of iron or copper, usually a saw blade or a piece of sheet copper, to which a couple of barbs made of
"Charles Wilkes, Exploring Expedition, IV, p. 486. * George Gibbs, Contributions to North American Ethnology, 1877, I, p. 17

elk’s or deer’s horn are secured, and the whole covered with a coating of spruce gum. Formerly the blades were of mussel shell. The shaft is made of yew, in two pieces, which are joined in the middle by a very neat scarf, firmly secured by a narrow strip of bark wound round it very tightly. The length is 18 feet; thickest in the center, where it is joined together, and tapering thence to both ends. To be used, the staff is inserted into the barbed head, and the end of the lanyard made fast to a buoy, which is simply a seal skin taken from the animal whole, the hair being left inward. The apertures of the head, feet, and tail are tied up air-tight, and the skin is inflated like a bladder. One example collected by Swan is 3 feet long (fig. 20).

When the harpoon is driven into a whale the barb and buoy remain fastened to it, but the staff comes out, and is taken into the canoe. The harpoon which is thrown into the head of the whale has but one buoy attached; but those thrown into the body have as many as can be conveniently tied on; and, when a number of canoes join in the attack, it is not unusual for from thirty to forty of these buoys to be made fast to the whale, which, of course, can not sink and is easily dispatched by their spears and lances. The buoys are fastened together by means of a stout line made of spruce roots, first slightly roasted in hot ashes, then split with knives into fine fibers, and finally twisted into ropes, which are very strong and durable. These ropes are also used for towing the dead whale to the shore.’

<<<Page: 378>>>

The Makahs, according to Swan, are not active in vocations or pursuits other than fishing and whaling, and obtain some of their supplies by barter from neighboring tribes and white men. They devote very little time to agricultural pursuits or to the capture of land animals, but excel in the management of canoes, making long voyages from land for fish, and fearlessly attacking the whale. They manufacture their own fishing apparatus, and take especial pains with their harpoons and lances, for which instruments they have the greatest regard. The principal implements used by the Makah whalers are harpoons. lances, ropes, and buoys. The harpoon heads were formerly made of shell, but at present are of sheet copper or steel, with barbs of elk or deer horn, tightly seized to the blades by cords or strips of bark, the whole being covered with spruce gum. The lanyards attached to the harpoon are made of the sinew of the whale twisted into a rope and served with fibers of nettle. The lances are of metal, with sockets for the ends of the poles. The poles for the harpoons and lances are

heavy and unwieldy, but durable and strong. The buoys are of sealskin with the hair inside, inflated when used, and attached to the harpoon lanyards. These buoys are used for the double purpose of impeding the progress of the whale, so as to enable the Indians to kill it, and to prevent the animal from sinking when dead.
All whaling implements which have been used in the capture are regarded with especial favor and handed down from generation to generation, and it is deemed unlucky to part with them. These Indians did not acquire the art of whaling from white men, and still employ the apparatus and processes which have come to them through countless generations. One point deserves especial consideration. The process of wrapping their harpoon lanyards, commonly known as **serving,” has been in use by all seafaring men for a number of years. The Makah Indian has his serving stick and mallet, manufactures his twine from the fibers of the nettle, and ‘* serves” his lines as neatly as do the fishermen of the Eastern coast, and it is said they were familiar with the process before the advent of the whites. !
' James G. Swan, Indians of Cape Flattery.

The implements used by the Makah Indians for catching salmon were a hook and a spear. The former is in size as large as a shark hook, having a socket at one end formed of wood. These hooks are made by the Indians from files and rasps, which they purchase of the traders, and are forged into shape with ingenuity and skill. The socket is made from the wild raspberry bush (Rubus spectablis), which, having a pith in its center, is easily worked and is very strong. This socket is formed of two parts, firmly secured to the hook by means of twine, and the whole covered with a coat of pitch. Attached to this hook is a strong cord about 3 feet long. <A staff or pole from 18 to 20 feet long, made from fir, is used, one end of which is fitted to the socket in the hook, into which it is thrust, and the cord firmly tied to the pole. When the hook is fastened into a salmon it slips off the pole and the fish is held by the cord, which enables it to perform its antics without breaking the staff, which it would be sure to do if the hook were firmly fastened."
Giglioli figures a barbed harpoon head (Kaheita), made of whale’s bone, brought from Nutka by Captain Cook, and now in the Natural History Museum of Florence. It has two barbs on one side and is attached to a line 10 mm. thick, served with twine.” This most interesting object, 10 inches long, reduces the harpoon head to its lowest terms. It reminds the student of the Fuegian type, or, better, of the universal American fundamental barbed type. At the base or, joint — and this is one of the crucial points for invention—there is merely the rudest kind of pivot to fit into the socket at the end of the shaft. There is no perforation, or even bulb, to hold the line. The shank is simply hacked to make it rough. Some old pieces in the U.S. National Museum, of bone, antler, iron, and copper, collected by Gibbs, McLean, and Fisher, have from one to four barbs on one side, and have line holes or projections for the end of the connecting line.
Ellis says that the Nutka (Wakashan) Indians had two kinds of harpoons—one of bone, the other of shell. The former—that is, the barbed head—is 6 inches long, pointed, having barbs on one side. Of the one with the shell blade, the butt end is ‘‘so contrived by means of a socket as to fix upon a pole 10 feet in length. The shaft is forked at the end, so that two pieces of the bone are to be fixed on at the same time.” ‘To the shank of the barb.a strong line is attached, to the other end of which is fastened a seal skin, blown up. The float is said to prevent the animal from keeping under water. It was dispatched with the lance.* This corresponds precisely with the specimens in the National Museum collected by Swan in recent times. In one of his examples the mussel shell, ground to a razor edge, forms the

blade, and it is so neatly fitted between the spurs forming the toggle and covered with pitch as to make a sure and efficient weapon. All that the iron did later on was to replace the rather brittle edge of shell, without modifying any other portions of the intricate apparatus.
Marchand’s account of the harpoon in Barclay Sound, west side of Vancouver Island, is here given. The strong lance, which may be called their unerring lance, is intended for striking the whale when he presents himself on the surface of the water, and never does an American fail to wound him at the first stroke. Instantly the slighter lances are employed for darting the harpoons, to each of which is fastened one of the long pieces of rope. The other end of the line is fixed to one of those large bladders filled with air. This sort of balloons, floating on the water, cease not to indicate the place where to find the whale, dead or wounded, that has carried with him a harpoon, and the fishermen, directed by this signal, follow him up and celebrate by songs of joy their victory and conquest. But the most difficult is not, undoubtedly, to deprive the monster of life. It remains for them to get possession of him, and it would never be believed, if we were not assured of the fact, that with skiffs so slight and ticklish as canoes hollowed out of the trunk of a tree a few men should succeed in dragging the space of 4+ or 5 leagues an enormous mass and contrive to run it on shore on a beach, where they can cut it up.’ A glimpse at the ethnographic chart of North America shows that the Aht or Nutka division of the Wakashan family occupies the western portion of Vancouver Island, while the coast of British Columbia belongs to the Haeltzukan branch, as shown by Boas. The same author fixes the limits of the Chimmesyan family on the coast between the Koloschan and the Haeltzukan tribes.*. All about Puget Sound were Salishan tribes, and a small contingent of the same family approach the harpoon area at the mouth of the Bella Coola River.
Harlan I. Smith dug up at the junction.of Thompson and Fraser rivers two barbed harpoon heads 9 inches long, made of antler. They have two barbs on one side and a hole for the connecting line.®
In a future paper the fishhooks of the same area will be discussed, from which it can be more clearly shown how the idea of the bent finger and its imitators in bone and wood has also dominated the form of the fish spear and the harpoon.

farther north. The barbed heads are of steel. The piercing end of each is lanceolate. The barbed portion is toothed or notched in its entire length, six barbs on the one side and five on the other, alternating. The tang is oval, perforated, and has a small loop or clevis riveted fast to it. Through this is secured a plaited lanyard or loop of seaweed, by means of which the head is attached to the foreshaft or to the mainline. Each one of these fits in a cedar case, made by splitting a piece of wood, hollowing it out, and then lashing the parts together, a method adopted by these Indians in their musical instruments and various receptacles.
The toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 88929, U.S.N.M.) of the Haida Indians, figured by Niblack, is still more interesting, being quite similar to the harpoon arrowheads of the South American tribes. The head is of steel, the piercing ends in the form of a spike. At the other end the metal is split open and one portion extended backward for a barb or spur. Just where the spur unites with the body a rawhide line is wrapped to form a shallow socket. Into this the end of the loose shaft fits, being cut off in the form of a wedge at the end. The other end of the loose shaft is widened out to fit into a socket in the end of the shaft. The thong which is wrapped around thé head is also securely fastened to the foreshaft at its middle and looped at the other end, to be spliced on to the long line for securing the game. (Cat. No. 88803, U.S.N.M.)
Captain Cook draws attention to the barbed harpoons on Cook Inlet, made of fir, about 4 feet in length. They are mentioned here to mark the northern terminus of the unilateral barb, but they will be described fully later on. One end is formed of bone, into which, by means of a socket, another small piece of bone, which is barbed, is fixed, but contrived in such a manner as to be put in and taken out without trouble. This is secured to the middle of the stick by a strong, though thin piece of twine composed of sinews. ‘These darts are thrown with the assistance of a thin piece of wood 12 or 14 inches long. The middle of this is slightly hollowed for the better reception of the weapon, and at the termination of the hollow, which does not extend to the end, is fixed a short, pointed piece of bone to prevent the dart from slipping. The other extremity is furnished with a hole for the forefinger, and the sides are made to coincide with the other fingers and thumb in order to grasp with greater firmness.’
The Chilkotin Indians in western Canada spear salmon with a doubleheaded toggle harpoon. The shaft is a long pole, upon the inner end of which are spliced two short pieces of wood which serve as foreshafts. The head of the harpoon is made of three separate pieces, the point or spike and two flukes or spurs, all securely lashed together in such a way that a cavity is left in the base for the end of the foreshaft.

line is tied at its ends around the heads, just above the flukes or barbs, and the middle of the line is securely held in place near the end of the shaft by a lashing of line. When the salmon is struck the toggle is fastened in the animal’s body and is withdrawn from the ends of the

=" foreshaft. The short line between the ‘Ee = a head and the shaft enables the fisherman i i
to play with the victim and to land it more successfully.’ Similar toggle heads on a bifureated shaft are to be seen among the Thompson River Indians of British Columbia. This weapon is used for harpooning salmon from the shore while they are running. The handle is 15 feet or more in length and has two prongs securely spliced on to the end of the shaft (fig. 22). The Thompson River specimen is similarly made up of three pieces, the point and the two spurs, but these last do not bend outward, as in the Chilkotin example, but lie close against the foreshaft, leaving a narrow cavity to fit over the end of the latter, which is whittled in the form of a wedge. The line or leader which holds these two barbs to the front end of the shaft is braided, and the ends are caught under the lashing by means of which the toggle is built up. James Teit says that when the fish is struck the barb points are detached,

western corner of the State, and Mr. Sawyer’s drawings, made at the time they were excavated, does not reveal harpoons; but two varieties of throwing sticks were dug up. Cushing found no barbed heads. It was a great surprise to find the atlatl or spear and harpoon thrower in Florida. In 1895, when Cushing first heard of the wonderful remains at San Marco, Von den Steinen had just revealed the finding of the same implement in the Mato Grosso, Lumholtz and Seler announced its existence in northern Mexico, and the author discovered it in the cliff dwellings of the Verde. Cushing’s are the central finger-hole type and the two-holed type for the fore and the middle finger. As the Gulf Stream sweeps past the Orinoco mouth, across the Caribbean sea to Yucatan, and thence in a narrower and swifter current past Florida Keys, one is not surprised to find a Mexican weapon there.
Mr. H. A. Ernst says: ‘‘The Seminole Indians of the Everglades now use white man’s hooks, but adhere to the old-fashioned harpoon, which is used in catching fish and terrapin.” The reader will find abundant evidence of the use of barbed harpoons in the Southern Straits in quotations from Adair, Barker, Bartram, de Bry, and Hennepin. Adair accompanied the Indians killing sturgeons in Savannah River with green swamp harpoons. These are long, sharp-pointed green canes, well bearded and hardened in the fire. When they discovered a fish they thrust into its body one of the harpoons. ‘‘As the fish would immediately strike deep, its strength was soon expended in violent struggles against the buoyant force of the green dart. As soon as the top end of the dart appeared again on the surface of the water, we made up to the fish, renewed the attack, and in like manner continued until we had secured our game.”' These southern harpoons were of the very lowest grade, if they were worthy of the name at all. The motives for devising a highly organized type did not exist.
In Raw’s Prehistoric Fishing, barbed harpoon heads are figured. These were taken from mounds, shell heaps, and other remains, from Maine to Michigan. They all belong to the barbed variety, and are of the simplest kind. Three types might be said to exist in Dr. Wilson’s collection in the National Museum, the sagittate, in which the barbs are equal on the two sides of the point; the forms with multiple barbs of the same number on either side; those having an uneven number of barbs on the two sides, usually two on one edge and three on the other, and those with any number of barbs on one side, as on the north Pacific _ coast. At the tang end barbed harpoons are divided into two classes by means of the connecting line which joins the head to the shaft, namely, the notched tang and the pierced tang. These again are fur-
ther subdivided, for the notch may be only a scratching or roughening
of the surface or a bulb, and the piercing may be only a small hole or

large opening. About the Great Lakes barbed harpoon heads are plentiful, notched and pierced.
Charlevoix describes the sturgeon spear of the Iroquois fishermen on the Great Lakes. Two men go out in a canoe, one to paddle, the other, in the bow, holding a barbed harpoon dart secured to the canoe by a long cord. Ingersoll compares this to the Columbia River sturgeon chaser. The hook is like a gaff attached to a short wooden socket fast to a line, the other end of which is tied to the canoe. The operation of catching is described by Swan.’ On the authority of Dr. W. M. Beauchamp the barbed harpoon had a wide variation among the Iroquois and the tribes on the Great Lakes. They are, as regards their barbs, unilateral and bilateral, and as to the tang, notched, bulbed, and pierced. The bilateral and sagittate forms are earlier and in larger numbers. Recent Mohawk, oe and Seneca sites yield large specimens. Both kinds are most plentiful at the inlet of Onondaga Lake, the outlet of Oneida Lake, and near Chaumont Bay, in Jefferson County. At Brewerton more harpoon heads have been found than in all the rest of New York and, perhaps, than all the eastern United States. It is an excellent place for the work of the harpoon. The large Iroquois harpoon had only a short point. The counties in New York yielding barbed harpoons are Jefferson, Montgomery, Madison, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Livingston. They are found in village sites and camps, rarely in graves, coming out of the ashes, says Beauchamp, in fine order.
Dr. Beauchamp has made a thorough study of the bone harpoon head in the Iroquois country in New York. The reader will have to consult his Bulletin of the New York State Museum to appreciate the endless variety of forms carved out by this quick-minded race. There are pierced, bulbed, and notched bases, unilateral and bilateral barbs, wide and narrow blades, single barbs and multiple barbs, long barbs and short barbs, alternate and opposite barbs. One would require the vocabulary of the botanist for leaves to define the shapes in Bea vuchamp’s figures.
Josselyn tells us that among the New England Indians bass and bluefish were taken in harbors and in the mouths of barred rivers, the fishermen being in canoes and striking the fish with a ‘‘fizgig,” a kind of dart or staff, to the lower end of which was fastened a sharp, jagged bone with astring to it. As soon as the fish was struck the hunter pulled away the staff, leaving the barbed head in the fish’s body, and fastened the other end of the string to the canoe. Thus they hauled often as many as ten great fish to the shore.
Sturgeon were taken in this way at night on the fishing banks, where they were feeding upon small fishes called lances, sucking them out of the sand. The Indian helted a piece eof dry birch bark and held it

over the side of the canoe; the sturgeon, seeing this light, mounted to the surface, where it was slain and captured with a fizgig.*
Dr. Fewkes calls attention to walrus-ivory spear points in Nova Scotia similar to those used by the Eskimo. The walrus frequented the coast of Prince Edward Island within historic times. The points are not definitely described.”
The Eskimo harpoons are of every variety, barbed or toggle. The dependence of the people largely on aquatic animals for food, dress, house, furniture, tools, and utensils of all sorts makes some kind of retrieving device absolutely necessary. They use the lance also most effectively, but the weak spear, with which the Indian tribes are wont to pick fish from the water, would be of little use among the Eskimo. The variety of animal life, both in size and habit, as well as differences of terrestrial conditions, have stimulated the Eskimo mind to the utmost in devising the most varied additions to what was in the beginning quite simple. Here, also, along the Arctic shore, more than in all other environments of the Western Hemisphere combined, suggestions of improvement have come from without. It is nature’s pedagogic institute. More than that, harpoon heads, large and small, of most appropriate patterns, have been made by machinery and traded to the Eskimo by whalers and fur hunters. In this part of the paper the specimens will be described as they occur. The question of the derivation of each feature will then be more easily settled.
A. B. Meyer calls attention to this and says that the little toggle heads of harpoons were not invented in their present form. Semper encountered them among the Negritos of the Palanan, north coast of Luzon, for pig shooting, in the form of harpoon arrows. Meyer describes an example from Bataan, after A. Schadenberg, and figures examples from Palanan and Bataan. All of these have 3-feathered shafts, spindle-shaped loose shafts, attached to both head and shaft by a short line, and iron heads, including both barb and toggle characteristics. The barbs are sometimes at right angles to the plane of the line hole, in other examples in the same plane. In some the toggle head has a conical projection for a socket, the latter being on the end of the loose shaft. Of the last-named pattern the Eskimo examples have no parallel forms. °
The Eskimo province may be divided into the following areas or subdivisions:
Area 1. East Greenland, west Greenland, Labrador, and Hudson Bay.

Area 2. The central Eskimo of Boas.
Area 3. The arctic Eskimo, from the mouth of the Mackenzie River, including Point Barrow and Kotzebue Sound.
Area 4. The Bering Sea Eskimo, including Bering Strait southward to Norton Sound, the lower Yukon, Nunivak Island and the mainland, Bristol Bay, and Kadiak.
In this seemingly out-of-the-world location the harpoon is far from its original form. All specimens are toggled and iron enters surprisingly into their composition. Holm (1887) figures the different varieties in his Plates 15, 16, 29, 30, 32, 33.
The hinged lance is here also with shaft of wood, having hand rests on the sides, assembling lines of rawhide to hold the parts together, and foreshaft with flat top, from the middle of which a short cone projects. Some lances have, instead of hand rests for thrusting or hurling from the hand, the throwing stick or ajagsick. The head of the hinged lance consists of three parts, the iron blade (1), set in a shank of ivory (2), and this is fastened into a block of the same material (3), with flat base, in the center of which is a cavity just fitting over the cone on the top of the foreshaft. This block is hinged to the foreshaft by means of elastic rawhide thongs piercing it and the shaft’ (fig. 28).
The plainest variety of east Greenland has a wooden shaft, with chisel-shaped ice pick at the end. The toggle head is of bone or ivory, with iron blade, flat, cone-shaped body, two line holes quite through the body, united by a groove on the back, into which the line sinks. The shaft socket is in the center of the base, two wing-like barbs flanking it. The complete sealing harpoon is modeled after that of west Greenland, having eyelets instead of hooks for the throwing stick, and being covered all over with little figures of animals, reminding one slightly of the Aleutian hat and the bark onlaying of the Amur people.
The barbed leisters or fish spears, with two or more barbs, are turned by these Eskimo into a toggle arrangement quite unique in America. The piercing ends are of iron or bone and hinged as in a pair of scissors, the cutting end piercing the animal, the other end lying against the shank. When they have entered the flesh these points turn at right angles and toggle.” A most curious device is the adaptation of this hinged head to a seal harpoon, provided with a little sled on the fore end of a very long shaft. It will be seen later on that the west Greenlanders use for deep-sea fishing for seals a very long shaft worked by two men, and that the Giliaks make a harpoon shaft nearly a hundred feet long, with a float on the fore end.*

A harpoon (Cat. No. 168960, U.S.N.M.) from east Greenland, presented by the Copenhagen Museum, is shown in Plate 4. While in general appearance the weapon is similar to those of the same character in southwest Greenland, the head is a type peculiar to the eastern part of the peninsula. The body is of narwhal ivory, conical in outline, a long, lanceolate blade fastened in by means of a rivet. The point of the loose shaft enters directly into the base, which is flanked by two conspicuous barbs or spurs. A strip of iron is riveted across the lower portion on either side to strengthen it. An interesting feature in this specimen is the line hole, which consists of two separate perforations, united on the back with a groove or countersunk cavity to prevent the line from chafing. The loose shaft, which has been neatly spliced at the upper end, has a flat surface at the base, with a projection in the middle, fitting into a cavity on the front of the foreshaft, and the two are tightly hinged together by means of a lashing of elastic rawhide. The use of this joint has been elsewhere explained. The foreshaft is in this specimen a cap of ivory, squared off on top, and the middle left projecting for the socket on the base of the loose shaft. The shaft is of wood, and has on its surface the following attachments: A knob of ivory at the lower end, three hooks or pegs for the throwing stick, one to catch into its base or working end, and two near each other fitting into holes in the manual end of the throwing stick, as seen in the figure. Near these pegs is a hook of ivory, over which fits

The throwing stick has a perforation at the
working end instead of a peg. The line of rawhide is fastened immediately into the head of the harpoon and has a toggle at the other end to be attached to the line of the float. The other accessories to harpoons of this class are to be seen in Plates 14, 15, and 16 of Holm (1887).

The oldest accounts of the Eskimo refer to those of Greenland and Labrador, but some of their apparatus remains quite primitive. Again, in a preliminary work like this the area can not be accurately subdivided. The natives themselves are fond of wandering about, and

they leave their ideas as well as their accouterments. The task of discrimination is further embarrassed by the collector’s unfortunate habit of labeling a specimen with the name of the place where he procured it, himself frequently not knowing the place of its manufacture. The numbers on the specimens are arranged as they occur in the catalogue of the U. S. National Museum.
Hans Egede, the apostle to Greenland (1721-1736), gives the following description of the harpoon and its uses:
When the Indians of Greenland go whale catching they put on their best apparel, fancying that if they did not come neatly dressed the whale, who can not bear sloyenly habits, would shun them. About fifty men and women set out in one of the large boats called kone-boats. The women carry along with them their sewing tackle, consisting of needles and thread, to sew and mend their husbands’ spring coats should they be torn, and also to mend the boat in case it should receive any damage. The men go in search of the whale, and when they have found it they strike it with their harpoons, to which are fastened lines or straps 2 or 3 fathoms long, at the end of which they tie a bag of a whole seal skin filled with air; so that when a whale finds itself wounded and runs away with the harpoon it may the sooner become tired, the air bag hindering it from being long under water. When it thus loses strength they attack it again with their spears and lances until it is killed; then they put on their spring coats, made of dressed seal skin, all of one piece, with boots, gloves, and caps, sewed and laced so tight together that no water can penetrate them. In this garb they jump into the seaand begin to slice the fat off all around the body, even unde the water; forin these coats they can not sink, since they are full of air, so that they can, like the seal, stand upright in the sea. They are sometimes so daring they will get upon the whale’s back while there is yet life in him, to cut away the fat.
They go much the same-way to work in killing seal except that the harpoon is lesser, and to it is fastened a line 6 or 7 fathoms long. At the end is a bladder or bag made of a small sealskin filled with air, to keep the seal, when he is wounded, from diving under water and being lost again. In the northern parts, where the sea is frozen over in the winter, the Eskimo use other means. They first look out for holes which the seals make with their claws, about the size of a half penny, that they may catch their breath. After they have found a hole they seat themselves near it upon a chair made for the purpose, and as soon as they perceive the seal come up to the hole and put its snout into it for air, they immediately strike it with a small harpoon to which is fastened a strap a fathom long, which they hold in the other hand. After it is struck and can not escape, they cut the hole so large that they may get the animal up through it, and as soon as they have its head above the ice they can kill it with one blow of the fist.
A third way of catching seals is to make a great hole in the ice, or in the: spring they find holes made by the seals. Near to these holes they place a low bench upon which they lie down upon their bellies, having first made a small hole near the larger one, through which they let softly down a perch 16 or 20 yards long, headed with a harpoon, a strap being fastened to it which one holds in his hand, while another, who lies upon a bench with his face downward, watches the coming of the seal, when he cries ‘‘Kae,’’ whereupon he who holds the pole pushes and strikes the seal.
The fourth way is this: When the seals, in the spring, are lying upon the ice near holes which they themselves make to get up and down, the Greenlanders, clothed in sealskin, holding harpoons in their hands, creep along upon the ice, moving their

<<<Page: 391>>>

heads backward and forward and snoring like a seal till they come so near them that they can reach the animal with their harpoons and strike them.!
The Greenlanders, says Nansen, use two forms of the great harpoon: (1) the Unak, with butt end finished in a bone knob; it is longer and slighter than (2) the Ernangnak, having on its butt end two feathers of bone, commonly whale rib, to increase the weight and guide the flight.” The line is made of young walrus (Odobawnus rosmarus) or of bearded seal hide (Phoca barbata), from 15 to 18 yards long and one-fourth inch wide. The float is the skin of a young ringed seal (Phoca fotida) taken off whole, the hair removed, the apertures all tied
= up, and the whole dried. The line is coiled on the
kaiak stand.’ He calls the great Greenland and

and its accessories will be found (pp. 62-64), with figures.
Before giving in detail the structure of the western Greenland harpoon, attention must again be called to the difficulty of making neat distinctions. Recent explorations by Peary especially assign Smith Sound material to the Central Eskimo; at least it is intermediate. The constancy of iron in the oldest specimens aiso demands that no hasty conclusions be drawn concerning the original Eskimo harpoon, either as to its design or ornamentation.

A modern toggle head of a whale harpoon (Cat. No. 19510, U.S.N.M.), from Greenland, is seen in fig. 25. This unfinished specimen shows the last step in the development of the machine-made toggle head. Everything about the specimen demonstrates this—the mathematical form, the saw cut for the blade, the socket for the foreshaft, the angular barb, and especially the large line hole cut straight across the body of the toggle head. In the primitive examples this last feature cost.

the maker a great deal of trouble. He had to bore two holes slanting toward each other and meeting inside, to unite these by removing the rough surface, and to separately prepare grooves to receive the line. This is the gift of J. H. Clark.
Plate 5 in the U. S. National Museum is a complete seal harpoon from west Greenland (Cat. No. 35670). The head is a combination of barb and toggle, sagittate in outline, with a slender waist and wide base; a very gracefully-made specimen. The blade is rhomboidal, but squared off in the saw cut and riveted with iron. The oblong line hole passes straight through the waist and has slight line grooves.
There are three barbs. Those on the side are angular, prominent, and sawed out, so as to present three flat surfaces inside; the terminal barb angular, formed by the two sloping faces of the back and the beveled surface of the butt; socket for the end of the foreshaft narrow and clean cut. The butt end has no bend or curve in it, but is formed by a single ‘cut in the same plane.
The line is drawn through the line hole, bent, and the end fastened down 6 inches from the toggle head, and held fast by a seizing of sinew threeply braid, laid on for an inch in half hitches.
At a distance of 50 inches from the toggle head is an eyelet of bone, 13 inches long and half an inch wide, haying rectangular outline and pierced Na with three holes, through one of Reimar rin which the line runs. Just beyond this eyelet is a wrapping of sinew string acting asastop. The whole line is over 30 feet long and terminates in a toggle of reindeer antler, with a knob at one end and a bifurcation at the other end. This is to hook into a loop in the line of the float, to be now described.
The hide of a young seal was drawn off over the neck, care being taken to keep the legs and other parts complete. After being turned right side out, the hide was sweated, depilated, and again turned wrong side out and all openings carefully fastened up air-tight. But into the puckered orifice of the neck a stout rawhide loop was inserted and made fast and into one forefoot a bone mouthpiece was firmly lashed. About

<<<Page: 395>>>

this specimen, as on many other floats, little holes were stopped by studs of wood or hard animal substance, set in when the hide was green, which, shrinking, renders the joint perfectly tight. As mentioned, into the puckered neck of the float was knotted a bend or loop 6 inches long. This would serve as a handle and be inseparable from the float. A stout piece of rawhide line, 3 or 4 feet long, was bent to form a loop at each end. Into one loop the float-loop was spliced, and into the one on the other end of the line the toggle of the harpoon line hooks. The bends in the ends of the short float line are seized down by means of sinew braid in half hitches. The float is always associated with the kaiak, and therefore it has attachments for it, as well as for the line. In the end of the float, where the float loop is fastened, and on either side of the latter, two short rawhide lines are inserted and made fast on the inside. These short pieces are run into the ends of a device,.made from two pieces of antler, for slipping under one of the cross lines on the deck of the kaiak. For this purpose a hole was bored up in the end of each one of these pieces 1 inch, met by a hole bored half way in at the side, and half an inch above another hole was bored quite through. The line from the float is drawn up the hole at the end, out at the meeting hole, and through the upper hole, where it is fastened with a peg, the two holes being united on the outside by a countersink to prevent abrasion by ice. A wooden peg wedges the line fast in the inner hole. The two front ends of the pieces of antler are united by an iron'rivet. These details are mentioned to call attention to the cunning makeshifts of savages working with the poorest tools. The maxim, ‘‘ Where there’s a will there’s a way,” is quite true among the Eskimo.
The shaft is a typical Greenland form and consists of loose shaft and rawhide hinge or connecting line, foreshaft, shaft, and ‘*‘ feathers.”
The loose shaft is an elongated cone of ivory 73 inches in length, having at a distance of 1 inch from the butt a raised ornament of rings and bands turned as ina lathe, the middle band with cross ridges. Two holes are bored, one above the other, through this ornament, and three holes through the fore end of the wooden shaft for the rawhide thong that forms the elastic joint between loose shaft and foreshaft. This thong is doubled at its widest end and the whole drawn through one of the shaft holes, not tightly; it passes (1) through the lower hole of the loose shaft, (2) back through a hole in the shaft, (8) up through the outer hole in the loose shaft, (4) back through the loop in the first end, then through the third hole of the shaft and once wrapped ar round, the end being tucked under as in making a single knot after the whole is drawn as tight as possible.
The base of the loose shaft is squared off and socketed. The foreshaft is only half an inch long, but forms an ellipse 14 by 14 inches in diameter. It has a pivot or projection on top to fit into the socket of

<<<Page: 396>>>

the loose shaft and is excavated below to fit over a tenon in the end of the wooden shaft, which is kept from splitting by a wrapping of sinew twine.
The shaft, of pine wood, 5 feet 2 inches long and 14 inches thick, tapers somewhat toward the butt end. Upon it are the following additions: Buttons for holding the shaft on the kaiak, peg over which the eyelet on the line catches to hold the head on the loose shaft, two pegs for the throwing stick, and bone feathers.
The buttons for holding the apparatus on the kaiak are two little almond-shaped bits of ivory, attached to the shaft near either end by means of a short rawhide thong. These buttons are tucked under the cross lines on the deck of the kaiak, but on occasion do not offer any ratchet to prevent withdrawal. The throwing stick pegs for the two holes in that apparatus are of bone and extend quite through the shaft near either end. The west Greenland shaft for the seal harpoon is unique in having the pegs on the shaft and not on the throwing stick.
The butt end of the shaft is squared for the attachment of the two **feathers” carved from whale’s bone. The end of the shaft is beveled off and grooved.
It must be borne in mind that as a rule the North American Indians have three feathers on their arrows, radiating outward; the Eskimo have two, laid flat on the flat shaftment. Now on the west Greenland smaller harpoon, at either side of the butt, is a strip of whale’s bone 16 inches 'ong, from 1} inches wide, and one-eighth inch thick, both exactly alike, with long leaf-shaped outline terminating in a fish-tail bifurcation. These two plates are pegged on for 5 to 6 inches, so that their outsides are flush with the shaft, and their butt ends are held apart in place by an ivory peg or cylinder. The area of this device or attachment is very circumscribed. It is not shown by Boas, Kumlien, or Turner. The throwing stick is of light, coniferous wood, very broad in the manual part and tapering gracefully toward the working end. The top is slightly rounded up, the bottom of two surfaces meeting ina ridge along the middle. The shaft groove is an inch wide and from one-fourth to one-eighth inch deep, extending the entire length of the piece. It is right-handed, having a deep under-cut notch on the left margin for the thumb, just back of which on the margin is a pretty bit of bone pegged on. The hole in the manual part for the peg has in front of it a washer of bone set in to prevent the peg from wearing the hole larger. Into the working end of the throwing stick is neatly set a T-shaped bit of whale’s bone, held in place by pegs quite through both bone and wood. At the outer end of this bone is a large hole slanting forward and into it the rear peg on the shaft fits. When pulled straight ahead the hook holds firmly, but when the throwing stick begins to turn away from the shaft the hole unhinges from the peg. All this action with least resistance is provided ter in the device. Collected by N. P. Scudder.

A flat toggle head (No. 45855, U.S.N.M.) with a gibbous section has the back more compressed than the belly. The front end is rounded, the blade slit not deep, and rivet hole large. The line hole is curved upward and has deep line grooves. Barbs, two on the outer margins, formed by a skghtly incurved cut into the butt end. The butt is whittled away so that the toggle head is just as long on the belly as on the back. Length, 3 inches. Gift of the Copenhagen Museum. Example 63951, gift of Governor Fenckner, is somewhat similar, but the back is longer and the notch between the tips of the barbs is not angular.
Example No. 45670 in the U. S. National Museum is the point of a large harpoon from Greenland. The blade, of iron, was inserted in a saw cut in the end of the shank and riveted with iron, now decayed by rust. The shank, of whale’s rib, is rectangular in the section at the front and circular in other parts. Between the rectangular and circular portions are four barbs. At the angles the butt end is conical to fit into a socket. In the end of the shaft, 3 inches above, two holes are pierced for the insertion of

Fig. 26 is a combined toggle and barbed harpoon head from western Greenland (No. 45883, U.S.N.M.), all in one piece of antler. The body is narrow and flat, the spongy part of the material being the back of the implement, while the belly, which takes the strain of the line, is the outside hard portion of the antler. Fora blade, the fore end was sharpened to a point. There is no evidence of a metal blade haying been used in this head. The line hole ix formed by two slanting holes meeting on the back of the body, so as to leave a small opening on the back, a feature not common in Greenland specimens, but observed in many from the Amur region (Plate 7). The line grooves extend only half an inch backward, and then suddenly terminate. Originally there were doubtless three barbs; one, a strong hook on the left-hand margin between the point and the line hole, and two barbs at the butt, spread out like a fish tail, the tips being cut in an ornamental manner (see Plate 8, from Von Schrenk). The socket for the foreshaft is only three-fourths of an inch-deep. The butt end is cut off with a long bevel, steep on its lower half and sloping more and more outward. Length, 44 inches. Collected by Dr. Emil Bessels, but special locality not given.
A toggle head of bone from western Greenland (No. 45884, U.S.N.M), conoid in form and double convex in section, is shown in fig. 27.

This specimen, though exceedingly plain in shape, does not mark an early form of toggle harpoon head, but a later period, when they were made in great numbers, sometimes by machinery, and sold to the Eskimo, who found it easier to provide themselves in this way than to make them by their rude tools.
An old toggle head of a harpoon from north Greenland (No. 45885, U.S.N.M.), collected by Emil Bessels, is shown in fig. 28.
The body is of bone, the back nearly flat, being the soft part of the material, and the belly, which is more rounded, is of the outer, hard part of the bone, this being necessary in order to take the strain of the line.

The blade in this example is missing, and was inserted in a saw cut at the rounded end of the body and held in place by a rivet.
The shaft socket is a conical hole centered between the back and the front surfaces and flanked by barbs whose points are formed by the meeting of the back, the belly, and the socket or excavation in the rear for the foreshaft.
The line hole is formed by the meeting of two holes bored in from the under side and not quite through to the top. Line grooves project backward from the line hole so as to render all smooth to prevent the thong from chafing. Length, 2 inches.
A combined barbed and toggle head (Cat. No. 45886, U.S.N.M.) from west Greenland is shown in fig. 29, and is a gift of the Copenhagen Museum. The body is of bone, the back being formed of the hard or outside portion. The kerf for the blade is wide, and the latter, missing in

The butt is bifurcated, and the cavity for the end of the foreshaft seems to have been bored out after the barbs were formed.

A toggle harpoon head (No. 45889, U.S.N.M.) from western Greenland, made of bone all in one piece, is shown in fig. 32. It is double convex in section and the point is formed by shaving down the faces of the body. The line hole passes through the bone in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the blade, and the single barb is formed by beveling the end. The line grooves are slight, and the cavity for the shaft large, its margin continuous. Length, 5$ inches; width, onehalf inch; depth, fifteen-sixteenths inch.

The loose shaft of a toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 45893, U.S.N.M.), made of wood, from south Greenland, deserves consideration. It is spindle-shaped, elongated on one end, and short at the other, elliptical in cross section. Through the thickest
portion two holes are bored for the rawhide thong which unites it to the shaft. Examples of this part of the harpoon in wood are very
rare. Length, 94 inches.

An ancient barbed and toggle harpoon head (Cat. No. 45910, U.S. N.M.), made froma bit of hollow bone, from northern Greenland, collected by E. Bessels, is shown in fig. 33. The point has been cut off so that it is impossible to say how the blade was set on. The barbs on the margin in front of the line hole have been cut out squarely but their points have evidently been reduced. It is possible, however, that their present form represents nearly the shape of the original material. At.this point it is proper to make an observation which applies very largely to the forms of aboriginal implements. The savages understood how, in an emergency, to secure the largest amount of result with the least amount of effort. It is with inventions as with : language.

and interesting, being formed, not by a sloping cavity, but by means of a drill. The socket at the base is also conical, opening into the line hole, and two barbs of equal size are formed by cutting away the material of the back. This bifurcation is found on many Greenland specimens. Those who are acquainted with the Eskimo handicraft in localities where steel tools do not abound are interested to note what free and varied use these natives make of drills of different sizes. There are twenty examples of boring on this little toggle head, for the rivet, for the line hole grooves and socket, and besides for mending a crack in the material. For this last purpose we have not only perforations for the sinew mending, but gutters bored one twenty-fourth of an inch deep, into which the cord was countersunk. This will be better seen by an examination of the illustration.

seen on the right side of the left-hand figure, is double. The barbs on the margin are cut out square, as with a saw, but the sides of the tang are curved in, leaving shoulders at their base, from which point the body curves outward to the end of the spurs. The line hole is formed, as in most examples of this kind, by two independent conical bores which meet at their inner point. Line grooves are connected with these. The base is not cut off in a plane surface, but has the appearance of being scooped out, beginning on the under side with a perpendicular surface, which slopes more and more toward the

A combined barbed and toggle harpoon head (No. 63941, U.S.N.M.) of antler from Greenland is represented in fig. 36. It is rhomboid in cross section, sagged downward in the middle, and delicately made. The blade, of iron, formerly present, but now wanting, was held in place by a rivet. The line hole, formed by the meeting of two excaya-
tions, is curved, but not visible on the back. Line grooves short and.
whittled out. Barbs, three—two in front of the line hole and one at the butt. The barbs on the margin in front are sharp and prominent for such a small specimen, the cut of each being three-sided. The rear barb is cocked up and pointed, and its edges ornamented each with

Of this same type and pattern, but ruder, is Cat. No. 45910, from Greenland, made of bone, and somewhat dilapidated. The hard bone forms the back, and the excavations on the belly are in the spongy portion; the reverse of this is usually true.

Cat. No. 63963 in the U. S. National Museum is a harpoon of bone from southwestern Greenland. — It consists of two parts, the shank and the hinged toggle. The shank is pierced at one end to act asa hinge and at the other end in two places for the attachment of a shaft. The toggle is spindle shaped, hollowed on one side, and pierced with three holes to facilitate the hinging. This specimen is evidently an imitation or adaptation in bone of the iron fluke in the harpoons of the whalers. Length of shank, 42 inches. Gift of Governor Fenckner.
The smaller harpoon shaft (Cat. No. 72566, U.S.N.M.), from southern Greenland, is illustrated in figs. 48 and 49. This figure is introduced for the purpose of showing the details of the shaft, which are quite local. The loose shaft is made of bone or ivory, square at the base and socketed to fit over a small projection on the foreshaft. Two holes are bored through the former, and through these and two in the end of the shaft a stout rawhide thong passes and is tightly drawn to form an elastic spring, useful in the ship-

<<<Page: 409>>>

in this specimen is simply a cap of ivory with a little projection on the top. The hinging line is not attached to it in any way. The ivory pegs driven into the shaft near its lower end are for the throwing stick, which is peculiar to this region, and for the eyelets used in tightening the line when the toggle is in place and ready for action.
Especial attention is drawn to the lower end of the shaft, on which are pegged or riveted two plates of ivory, which not only resemble feathers on an arrow, but must perform a similar function. The foreshaft is so light that it could be of little use in giving directness to the flight of the weapon, but the feathers of ivory fastened on at the end would remedy this defect and steady the shaft in the air. It is thought by some that the existence of these plates of ivory on the base of the shaft is an indication of the descent of the harpoon from the arrow.
A kaiak lance (Cat. No. 74126, U.S.N.M.) from Holstenberg, Greenland, was collected by Capt. J. W. Collins.

The lashing is similar to that of the Cumberland Sound types, with slight local differences of administration. In front of the blade piece is the blade of iron, lanceolate in form, with truncated base set in a saw cut at the tip and held fast by a copper rivet. This lance is for stabbing the walrus or whale at close quarters from the kaiak. Length of shaft, 62 inches; loose shaft, 85 inches; blade, 33 inches.
An old toggle harpoon head (Cat. No. 130371, U.S.N.M.) from Upernavik, Greenland, is shown in fig. 50. It has an iron blade riveted on to the front of the body, parallel to its broadest diameter. The line holes were bored in from two directions, and apparently perforated the body after the manner of the toggle head used on the Amur River and figured in Schrenck. Length of body, 32 inches. Gift of Theodore Holm.
A harpoon for killing whales (Cat. No. 90103), used by the Little Whale River Indians on the coast of Labrador, is shown in fig. 51. The shaft is of wood, the foreshaft of bone. The base of it is wedge-shaped, and fits into the slit at the end of the shaft, being held in place by a lashing of sinew cord. On the end of the foreshaft fits the toggle head, with iron blade held fast by two rivets. The body of the toggle head is rectangular in cross section. The line hole passes through the sides and is not seen on the lower part. The wide barbed end is cut into three or four tooth-shaped parts. The line is of rawhide, plaited. The peculiarity of this harpoon is a board, somewhat circular in form, on the lower end of the shaft, which acts as a drag to the wounded animal, in place of a seal-skin float. The line passes between this board and the shaft, and has a handle or toggle fastened at the other end to be held in the hand of the fisherman.’

Hudson Bay have no other method of catching fish, unless it be by spears and darts; for no appearance of nets was discovered either at their tents or on any part of the shore. This is the case with all the Eskimo on the west side of Hudson Bay; spearing in summer and angling in winter are the only methods they have yet devised to catch fish, though at times their whole dependence for support is on that article.’
Coming to the central Eskimo, Boas says of them that they inhabit the northeastern part of the continent and the eastern islands of the Arctic-American archipelago. In Smith Sound they inhabit the most northern countries visited by man, and their remains are often found at its northern outlet. The southern and western boundaries are the countries about Fort Churchill, the middle part of Back River, and the coast west of Adelaiae Peninsula.” In this monograph will be found an excellent bibliography of that area, which has been famous in historic times for the efforts made there to find the northwest passage between the two great oceans.
The harpoon or principal lance (unahk, Kane) of the Eskimo is attached to the sealing line. The red or staff is divided at right angles in two pieces, which are aeatly jointed or hinged with tendon strips, but so braced by the manner in which the tendon is made to cross and bind in the lashing that, except when the two parts are severed by lateral pressure, they form but a single shaft. The point, generally an arrow-head of bone, has a socket to receive the end of the shaft; it disengages itself readily from its place, but still remains fast to the line. Thus when the kaiaker has struck his prey, the shaft escapes the risk of breaking from a pull against the grain by bending at the joint, and the point is carried free by the animal as he dives. At the right center of gravity of the harpoon, that point at which a cudgel player would grasp his staff, a neatly arranged cestus or holder (noon-sok) fits itself on the shaft. It serves to give the kaiakera good grip when casting his weapon, but slides off from it and is left in the hand at the moment of drawing back his arm.*
In the weapons used for killing their game there is considerable variety, according to the animal they are pursuing. The most simple of these weapons is the ‘“‘oonak” (Parry), which they use only for killing the small seal. It consists of a light staff of wood 4 feet in length, having at one end the point of a narwhal’s horn, from 8 to 10 inches long, firmly secured by rivets and wooldings; at the other end is a smaller and less effective point of the same kind.

runs along the whole length of the wood, each end passing through a hole in the ivory, and the bight secured in several places to the staff.
A considerable degree of ingenuity is displayed in an appendage called ‘**siatko,” consisting of a piece of bone 3 inches long, having a point of iron at one end and at the other a small hole or socket to receive the point of the oonak. Through the middle of this instrument is secured the allek, or line of thong, of which every man has, when sealing, a couple of coils, each from 4 to 6 fathoms long, hanging at his back. These are made of the skin of the oguke, as in Greenland, and are admirably adapted to the purpose, both on account of strength and the property which they possess of preserving their pliability even in the most intense frost."
Formerly the harpoon (unang, Boas) consisted of a shaft having at one end an ivory point firmly attached by thongs and rivets, the point tapering toward the end. The point was slanting on one side, so as to form almost an oblique cone. ‘Thus it facilitated the separation of the harpoon head from the unang. On the opposite end of the shaft another piece of ivory was attached, generally forming a knob. The material used in making the shaft was wood, bone, or ivory, according to the region in which it was manufactured. In Iglulik and in Aggo the narwhal’s horn was the favorite material for the whole implement, a single horn being sufficient to make a whole shaft. Wherever wood could be procured small pieces were ingeniously lashed together. As the shaft is apt to be broken by the struggles of the animal when struck by the weapon, it was strengthened by a stout thong running along the whole length of the shaft.’
A strange method of hunting is reported by Ross” as practiced by the Netchillirmiut. Eight men slowly approached the basking seal until it raised its head, when those in front stopped and shouted as loud as they could, on which three others ran up with incredible swiftness, and the leader struck it with the spear.*
Boas says that when the smaller bays are sufficiently frozen to permit, the hunters will visit, the edge of the newly formed floe in order to shoot the seals, which are afterwards secured by the retrieving harpoon.*
A fine old toggle head (Cat. No. 8278) from Smith Sound, was collected by Dr» I. 1. Have es. The body is of ivory, thin, spatulate in form, and lenticular in cross section. The blade of iron is almost concealed in a deep saw cut and fastened with an iron rivet. The line hole has been bored out with a drill that was too small and enlarged by cutting.

Eskimo has ingeniously drilled a series of holes along the margins and repaired the socket by means of sealskin thongs rolled backward and forward. The line in this case is a coarse thong of walrus hide, which is looped through the line hole and fastened by a wrapping with a smaller thong, in which the Eskimo has exhausted his ingenuity by a variety of knots and splices.
A combined barbed and toggle harpoon head of bone (Cat. No. 8279 U.S.N.M.) from Upernavik, Greenland, is shown in fig. 52. Body long, irregular cylinder, whose diameter varies in proportion to the strain at each point, cut off quite abruptly at the point. The economy of material is noteworthy. Blade cut shallow; iron blade broken off, but its lower margin remains in the cut, held in place by means of an iron rivet. Line hole small, curved up and strengthened on the outside by an additional thickness of the body. Line grooves slight. Barbs, two, the front one a very prominent hook, triangular underneath, its rear margin also a shallow hook with roundededge. In this respect the specimen is unique in the U.S. National Museum. The .

An old, much weather-beaten toggle head of bone (Cat. No. 10404,
‘U.S.N.M.), without blade, from Repulse Bay, is shown in fig. 54.
The body is perfectly flat on the back and uniformly ridged below, so that in section the form is that of a hat with narrow rim. The blade slit in the truncated tip shallow and wide and there is no show of rivets. Linehole, large and straight through, with wide grooves before and behind it. There were evidently two barbs, but after some mending one has disappeared. ‘The butt was beveled nearly in a plane surtace. Sockets half an inch deep. Length, 3% inches. Collected by Captain C. F. Hall.
Example 19519, in the U. S. National Museum, Plate 6, is a complete toggle mt poon for seals, from Cumberland Sound region, collected by George Y. Nickerson. The shaft (qijuqtenga) is of hard pine wood, quadrangular in section, with rounded corners, thick in the middle, and tapering toward either end. The foreshaft (qatirn) or socket piece, about 2 inches
dt the end of the shaft. In longitudinal section it is in the shape of a tanged lance blade, with the point truncated. The upper and outer end of the qatirn has a rounded socket for the reception of the loose shaft, to be described. At the lower end of the shaft isan ivory cap, set on and held in place by two wooden
dowels. Upon the narrow margin of the shaft, absent Fig. 54. in this specimen, is set a hand rest (tikagung), as a TOGGLE HEAD. stop for the hand of the hunter when making his Repulse Bay.

button of ivory, which fits into the telliqbing or eyelet
piece of ivory on the line. The loose shaft is a stout piece of ivory, spindle shaped, with a long taper in front and a very short tapering butt end. This fits like a ball at the socket joint into the socket.
At the end of the qatirn or foreshaft two holes are bored through the loose shaft 3 inches from the socket joint. Corresponding holes are bored through the shaft 4 inches from the front end. An inch farther back from these two holes two other holes are bored near together.
Looking at this apparatus from one side, a seal-skin thong passes from tne back forward through the upper left-hand hole in the shaft, up through the left-hand hole in the loose shaft, back and through the upper right-hand hole in the shaft, and up and through the right-hand

hole in the loose shaft, and down to the lower right-hand hole in the shaft, through and back through the lower left-hand hole in the shaft, half way round the shaft, and gathered in a loose knot through the lower bend of the thong on the front side of the shaft. This ingenious joint deserves especial attention. It is put in place while wet or green, and by its shrinking forms a close hinge for holding the loose shaft in the socket of the foreshaft. When a large animal is struck and the loose shaft rammed into its body, the violent motion, instead of breaking the brittle ivory, unbends the ball and socket joint, the thong serving as a hinge.
The toggle head (tokang) is of walrus ivory, flat on one side and obtusely angular on the other. On this same side are two large angular cuts, forming a perforation entirely through but not piercing the back. Barbs, two.
The line (alirn) is of stout rawhide bent through the hole in the toggle head, and the end is joined to the standing part by being sewed together, and also seized or wrapped at either end of this sewing. On the alirn, at a point exactly corresponding to the hand rest, is sewed or run the teliqbing, which is a somewhat flat piece of ivory, having five holes for the stitching or braid of sinew and a quadrangular hole cut in the broad part to fit over the ivory peg on the side of the shaft, which draws the line perfectly tight and holds the toggle head on the tip end of the loose shaft. The line may be continued to any length, where it terminates in a loop, and one or more bladders (avatang) may be attached to it. Length of shaft, 41 inches; loose shaft, 16 inches;

No. 25554 is similar to the foregoing in most respects. The outline is a little more artistic, but the general form and functioning of the parts are precisely the same. Length of blade, 24 inches; length of body, 6 inches.
Plate 7 is a typical broad toggle harpoon head (Cat. No. 34064, U.S.N.M.) from Cumberland Sound. The ivory body is lingulate in outline, nearly flat on the back, and rounded beneath for line hole and socket. Blade triangular, oblong, set 1 inch into the saw cut, and held in place by a large copper rivet. No blade hole is present. Line hole well back, large, bent up a little, and running into very deep line grooves. Socket wide and shallow. Barbs, two, formed by the bifurcation of the back. Butt end curved in and somewhat gouged out. Length, 5% inches. Collected by Ludwig Kumlein. The head fits back downward into a cover carved of a piece of pine wood. The point lies under two loops of baleen passed through the wood and frapped. A rawhide thong fastened into the butt serves to wrap the toggle and cover together. Other specimens in the Museum, collected in the same locality by Mr. Kumlein, have precisely the same characteristics. The specimens are more slender. It will be noted that the blade, the barbs, or spurs at the base, and the bottom or inside of the line hole are in parallel planes.

The head of a whale lance (Cat. No. 34067, U.S.N.M.) from Cumberland Gulf, collected by Ludwig Kumlein, is shown in fig. 56. The body is of ivory, in the form of a flattened conoid. The blade of iron is leaf-shaped, set into a saw cut at the point in the plane of the widest diameter of the head, and held in place by a brass rivet. The shaft socket is a deep cone. On either side of the head a line hole is made by two borings, one vertical and the other horizontal and larger. Into each a line or thong of seal hide is drawn, with a knot on the upper

holes bored in horizontally. Into these holes fit two rawhide thongs, by means of which the loose heads are attached firmly to the end of the shaft. The noticeable feature about this specimen is the thoroughly aboriginal style of boring the holes and of attaching the thongs. The slit is cut near the end of the thong, and through this the outer end passes, being bent backward. This forms a button which fits exactly into the horizontal hole on the side of the head. At the other end of the thongs in the drawing are shown methods of splicing practiced by the central Eskimo. There is nothing which exhibits their ingenuity more effectively than the way in which

mens, by a thong of rawhide. This ingenious joint is most effective as a universal hinge. It can be easily unloosed and made tighter. By a universal hinge it is meant that in every direction the loose shaft is sustained in a line with the shaft by the rigidity of the rawhide, which is not so strong, however, but that when an extraordinary strain is placed upon the loose shaft the rawhide will give way in any direction and allow the pivot to come out of the socket and save the apparatus from breakage. No long line is used with this form of apparatus. A similar specimen is figured from the Berlin Ethnological Museum, by Dr. Franz Boas.’ Length of shaft, 43 inches; loose shaft, 16 inches.
The harpoon of the Cumberland area, as shown by the previous descriptions and illustrations, is far more primitive and less affected by contact with Europe than that of Greenland or Hudson Bay type. In closing a study of this region attention is called to fig. 61, Catalogue No. 19521 inthe U.S. National Museum. It can not certainly be defined as a barbed head, nor as a toggle head. It has the form of the toggle head, but the line hole, instead of passing through the body above the socket, is a perforation in the end of the spur. A hole has been bored through this end in a line parallel to the axis of the body and is met by another perforation on the side of the spur. The connecting line evidently passed up through this opening and was toggled by means of an Eskimo knot formed by cutting a slot near the end of the thong and turning the end back through the slit. The socket does not differ from that of other harpoons. The head, however, is a large and lanceolate blade of chipped stone, reminding one of the whale lance blades brought home by Ray from Point Barrow and described by Murdoch. The tang of this blade fits upon an offset at the end of the body and is held in place by a knot, also of sinew braid. The perforation in the spur for the connecting line is almost unique in the collections of the U.S. National Museum. One other specimen has a perforation at this point, fig. 52, Catalogue No. 8279. In this specimen, however, the perforation seems to have no function, since through the body of the toggle head there is a regular line hole with line grooves.
The situation, the climate, the people, and the natural resources of this area are minutely set forth by Murdoch. The harpoon, as will be seen, is related to all these. In his treatise on Point Barrow Eskimo the last-named writer describes and figures both seal darts and toggle harpoons, and these are included in our subject. He says that the Eskimo use, to capture the smaller marine animals, a dart or small harpoon having a loose barbed head of bone fitted into a socket at the end of the shaft, to which it is attached by a line of greater or less
1Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, p. 496, fig. 432.

<<<Page: 425>>>

length. It is always contrived so that when the head is struck’ into the animal the shaft is detached and acts as a drag. At Point Barrow only the small form of dart is used. In ancient times a larger weapon, with bladder on the side of the shaft, was employed. All kinds of marine animals are also pursued with toggle harpoons of the same general type, but of different patterns for different animals. They are divided into two classes, those intended for throwing and those which are thrust with the hand. Both classes agree in having only the head attached permanently to the line fitted loosely to the end of the shaft, and arranged so that when struck into the animal it is detached from the shaft and turns under the skin at right angles to the line. The harpoons of this arctic Alaskan area are then explained and figured in great detail by Murdoch.’
The same writer says that before the introduction of iron it was discovered that when the blade of the toggle harpoon is inserted parallel to the line hole the toggle head is less liable to pull out. At any rate, by a kind of necessity, the blade part of the oldest forms 1s transverse to the line hole. Also, by the exigencies of the broad body of bone and ivory, the blade of the Amur and eastern Eskimo regions is inserted parallel to the line hole.
Late in the autumn, when the pack is driven toward the land by the north wind, the ice forms rapidly. The hunters travel over it, as soon as it will bear their weight, to look for the ‘‘alloos,” or breathing places, formed in the new ice when quite thin; this is gently raised by the animal’s head into a slight mound, and a small hole opened with its nose and breath. These spots would escape notice were it not for the congealing of the breath forming a little hummock of hoar frost on the surface. It is this which reveals to the hunter an ‘‘alloo,” or breathing place of a seal. Every seal has not its own breathing places, but more probably the instinct of the animal causes it to form many when the ice is thin, and many are frozen up for want of attention. Later in the season, as the ice grows thicker, it floats higher, leaving a larger and longer air space beneath, as the seal, when it visits the ‘‘alloo,” scratches away the ice on the under side.
By these places the hunter takes his position, and, for fear the seal will catch the scent of his person, he carries a small three-legged stool © on which he squats, taking his position on the lee side of the seal hole, watching and listening for the game. Of course he can not see the seal, but if there is a little wind he can see the vapor of its breath and hear the slight ripple in the water caused by the act of breathing.
When the hunter discovers the presence of the seal, his spear is sent crashing through the thin dome of ice into the animal, and so small

<<<Page: 426>>>

are the quarters that the seal is seldom missed. The ice is then broken away and the hole enlarged until the game can be removed, this work being done with the ever-present ice pick.
The implements used in this method of hunting seal are a harpoon, to the staff of which is attached an ice pick, a line, and a stool to stand on. The stool serves the purpose of keeping the feet of the hunter dry, for newly tormed ice is always very damp, and the long, patient waiting by the alloos would wet the feet of the hunter, after which he could not remain because of the intense cold, for furs are little protection if wet. At this season open water is formed by the current moving the ice, which presses together, leaving small spaces of open water. Seal passing these spaces will often come to the surface to breathe, and at such times fall an easy prey to the hunter’s rifle and retrieving harpoon.
lam indebted for the information given above to Captain Herendeen, who lived many yearsat Point Barrow. He also says that whale fishing is carried on in the months of April and May.
On arriving home from the great spring reindeer hunt, about the ist of April, the Eskimo have a few days of feasting and consultation. The wooden dishes of steaming venison are carried to the council house, ** Cuddigon Igloo,” where the men are gathered to talk over the coming whale hunt, and the sages tell of the conditions of ice required to make a favorable and successful season.
The wooden part of everything that is put into the umiak or freight boat is whittled or scraped off clean and smooth, so that the wood looks bright and new.
The women prepare the sealskin floats or pokes, as they are called by the American whalemen, as follows: A seal is captured and the skin cut around the head near the eyes. When the skin is cut free from the blubber and turned back, and the flippers are reached, they are unjointed near the body of the seal and the process continued until the carcass is removed. The blubber is scraped clean from the flesh side of the skin, and the bones carefully removed from the flippers. This is a delicate piece of work, for to cut the skin would ruin it fora float. After this is accomplished all natural vents to the body are closed by tying them around an ivory stud made for the purpose. Through one of these a hole is drilled to inflate the poke. The neck is passed over a stick about 6 inches long by 1 inch in diameter, then sewed up and the stick brought up to the seam and very firmly lashed with braided sinew. The poke is now blown up and stretched as much as possible by rolling and standing on it. Again it is scraped to remove the oil, and hung up in its inflated state to dry. Aftera few days it is oiled with the oil from the stone lamp. This dries more quickly than raw oil, and when dried again a coating is formed which is quite impervious to water. The lashing is now removed from the

<<<Page: 427>>>

neck, the skin carefully turned hair side out, a permanent lashing put on the neck and stick, when the poke is blown up again and is ready for use.
The harpoon line is made of walrus hide, very strong and often double. Its end is made fast around the lashing between the stick and the poke. Two pokes are used on the harpoon line, which terminates ina bridle. Still another poke is used as a trailer, the harpoon line being not more than 5 fathoms in length. The third poke or trailer has a small line 15 or 20 fathoms long. This trailer keeps on the surface and tells the hunters the position of the whale, thus making the pursuit much easier.
The harpoons used are to be found in the U. S. National Museum collection. The staff is about 10 feet long, tapering at each end. It is never thrown, but thrust into the whale, and great force is needed to drive this rather bulky instrument through the tough fibrous blubber when the cutting portion is formed of stone, as was always the case before the advent of the white man. These people are so governed by superstitions that they fear dire disaster would overtake them if they did not use the stone cutting points of their fathers on the first whale; after that they can use what seems best for the occasion.
The other implements to complete the outfit of an umiak are as follows: Three pokes well inflated and ready for use, and from three to five more all ready to be blown up; a paddle for each person, the one used for steering being much larger than the others; an implement for bailing the umiak, made of the reindeer antler, as it is very desirable to remove the water as soon as possible after it leaks in; a long knife, ~ fixed on a pole 10 feet in length, for cutting blubber and lean meat under water; three gaffs (hooks on poles) of different lengths, varying from 6 to 12 feet, the hooks of ivory; these are useful to hook on to the portion of flesh to be cut off; a little bag with plugs whittled out to put in the mouthpiece used to inflate the pokes; these plugs are often broken, and an extra one must be kept on hand; a large wooden scoop to bail when a quantity of water gets into the umiak; a spare whale harpoon; a crutch to lash in the prow of the umiak to rest the harpoon on; the two tips of this rest are carved in a rude semblance to a whale’s head; the skin of a crow, some eagle feathers, and a little earth in a small bag from the grave of some noted whale hunter, for good luck; some of these crow skins have been used many years and are in a most dilapidated condition, but are highly esteemed, for they have been present at the death of many a whale; great wisdom is accredited to the eagle and the crow, and it is considered quite the proper thing to use this talisman in order to overcome the cunning of the whale; a couple of toggles made of ivory, in the shape of | a whale; and straps to lash the pectoral fins of the whale when towing, so the fins will not drag heavily through the water; a bag of provi-

<<<Page: 428>>>

sions. The men of the boat’s crew carry their guns to shoot passing seals during the weary wait for the whale to come. Two women will be found in most crews. Each woman carries a sealskin bag to thaw out the snow for drinking purposes; the snow is put in the bag and its mouth firmly tied; it is then placed on her back between the inner and outer coat. The women also have their sewing outfits, to mend any breaks in the umiak.
In hunting through the ice the Eskimo of Point Barrow used a different shaped harpoon, with a long ivory piece on each end and a smaller head. As the seal comes up to blow they hurl this spear through the hole; then they drown the seal. After the animal is dead they haul it through the ice, picking the ice away until the hole is large enough to get the seal out. The
animals do not freeze quickly, because they have such a coating of blubber. (Mr. Charles Browers.)

The blade of this example is of brass, set into a saw cut in the end of the body and held in place by a bone rivet. The body is somewhat quadrangular in section, the line hole is well back from the blade, and the body widens from the front to this point. The line grooves extend outward beyond the base. The single spur is long and inclined upward. The base, contrary to the usual pattern, is somewhat convex. Inthe great mass of toggle harpoons the base is either concave or formed by two planes which make a different angle with the axis of the specimen. But in this case the contrary is true. The socket ‘for the foreshaft is wide and deep.

A new style toggle head (Cat. No. 56620, U.S.N.M.) from Point — Barrow, is shown in fig. 68. A large number of specimens of this type were brought home by the Ray expedition. The body is of antler and the blade is set into the saw cut at right angles to the plane of the body, barbed. The line hole is in the plane of the blade. The socket for the foreshaft divides the base into two parts with different slope, the one nearly perpendicular, the other with a slight angle, so as to form the barb. Of this specimen Murdoch says, ‘‘ It is a newly made model in reindeer antler of the ancient harpoon, but evidently by a man used to modern patterns, so that the blade is set in at the wrong angle.”
Walrus harpoons (Cat. Nos. 56670 and 56672, U.S. N. M.) from Point Barrow, Alaska, collected by P. H. Ray, are shown in figs. 69 aand b. The shaft of the former is of spruce, 71 inches long, rounded, and tapering from the middle in both directions. The club-shaped foreshaft is of ivory and has a wedge-shaped tang which fits in a cleft at the end of the shaft. The shaft and foreshaft are fastened together by a whipping of seal thong put on wet, one end fastened through a hole in the shaft, and the whole kept from slipping bya ridge on each

for the hand in thrusting. The details of this specimen are carefully worked out by Murdoch (p. 225). ‘ A sealing harpoon (Cat. No. 56774, U.S.N.M.) from Point Barrow, Alaska, collected by P. H. Ray, is shown in fig. 70. With respect to the use of this implement, Murdoch says that as the seals come up for air to their breathing holes or cracks in the ice a harpoon is used which has a short wooden shaft armed with an ice pick, and a long, slender loose shaft suitable for thrusting down the small breathing hole. It carries a toggle head, but has only a short line, the end of which is made fast permanently to the shaft. Such harpoons are used by all Eskimo wherever they are in the habit of watching for seals at their breathing holes. The foreshaft is simply a stout band for the end of the shaft; the loose shaftis of bone and has two holes to receive the end of the assembling line, which not only holds the loose shaft ace ot in place, but connects Fig. 71. 2 OLD BARBED AND TOGGLE HEADS. the other parts of the Point Parone shaft so that in case the Collected by P.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN HARPOONS. i a |
A bone harpoon head (Cat. No. 89337, U.S.N.M.) from Point Barrow is shown in fig. 72. It marks a step in the transition from barbed head to toggle in that the barbs are absent; a slot on each margin of the body marks the places where they might have been inserted. The line hole is transverse to the blade. The barb of the toggle head is four-pronged and sits awry with reference to the blade. Length, 44 inches. Collected by P. H. Ray, U.S. A.*
A combined barbed and toggle harpoon head (Cat. No.89377,U.S.N.M.) from Point Barrow, rhomboidal in section, conoidal behind the barbs, body all in one piece, of bone or antler, long, slender, tapering from butt to point like a lance blade, is shown in fig. 73. When the line hole is horizontal the blade is vertical. The line hole is a small round perforation. Line grooves, narrow; furrows, uniform.
There were at one time, possibly, barbs on the margins of the blade, for there exists on each, at a distance of 2 inches back from the point, a groove seven-eighths inch long, three-eighths inch deep, and less than oneeighth inch wide, undercut in front. Into this groove or slat could have been inserted marginal barbs of bone, or perhaps of stone. The barb at the butt end is made up of a series of four-lobed projections of different lengths.
The socket is a squared mortise into the bone, with one side quite open. On the margins of this space elongated slots are cut into an open, depressed space on the back, and the socket is completed by coiling around through them a string of animal tissue.
With this specimen should be compared an-example from North Cape, with top and bottom barb, oblong line hole decorated by furrows along the sides toward the tip, ey terminating in two branches and a cross line.” Length Fig. 73. of 89377 is 5 inches. Collected by P. H. Ray.*® BARBED AND TOG-

An old harpoon toggle head (Cat. No. 89382, U.S.N.M.) from Nuwuk, in the Point Barrow region, made of bone, all in one piece, is shown in fig. 77. In fact, it is a barbed head, like that of the seal dart, becoming a toggle head. The part answering to the blade is a point on the bone witha single barb on the lower side or belly. From the base of the barb the body widens to the butt end. The line hole is transverse to the blade. The butt is cut off diagonally. The socket is wanting, but the bone is concave on one side.

it antedated the rifle. Such a retrieving harpoon is called nauliga. The shaft (iptia) is of ash, 4 feet 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter, tapering very slightly to each end. ‘The ice pick (t@u), of walrus ivory, 14 inches long and 1 inch wide, has a round tang fitting into a hole in the butt of the shaft. Close to the shaft a small hole is drilled in one edge of the pick, and through this is passed a bit of seal thong, the ends of which are laid along the shaft and neatly whipped down with sinew braid, with the end wedged into a slit in the wood. The foreshaft (ukumailuta) is of walrus ivory, 4% inches long and 1% inches in diameter at the thickest part, and secured to the shaft by a whipping (ni’xma) of seal thong. ‘The loose shaft (igimt) is also of ivory and 2 inches long, and secured by a thong (ipiuta) spliced into a loop through the hole at the butt, as previously described. The end is hitched round the tip of the shaft with a marlin hitch, followed by a clove hitch below the whipping. The ivory finger rest (ti’ka) is fastened on with a lashing of whip cord (white man’s) passing round the shaft. The line catch (ki'lerbwin), which was of ivory and shaped like those on the walrus harpoons, has been lost in transportation. The head | differs only in size from those intended for the bearded seal, except in having a hexagonal body. It is 3.3 inches long and has a blade of iron fastened into a body of walrus ivory with a single wooden rivet. While there is no detachable leader, the head is attached by a separate piece of the same material to the line (tikaksia), which is 86 feet 10 inches long and made of a single piece of fine seal thong about one-eighth inch thick.

fitted in, all being held together by sinew braid. The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, cylindrical. The socket for the point is oblong. Feathers, two, especially noteworthy. The tip end of a half feather is punched into the wood near the neck, bent at right angle and carried forward and lashed down by the assembling line. The fibrous part of the feather is on the inside, between the rib and the shaft of the harpoon. This style of feathering is seen on example 48153, from Sledge Island, with three feathers; on 34020, from Norton Sound, and on several specimens from Golofnin, and does not occur any farther south. The point is of bone, concave on one side and convex on the other. Barbs, three on one margin and two on the other. The tang of the point is wide and flat. The line is of seal hide; martingale formed by splitting the line in the middle and tying the two ends to the shaft. There are two assembling lines—one extending from the upper knot of the martingale to the joint of the shaft and foreshaft, where it forms the seizing between the two; the other begins with the lower knot of the martingale, where one end of sinew thread is punched into the wood, passes backward, and is fastened off by a clove hitch. It then returns to the starting point, where it is again fastened off, and goes on to the feather by a series of turns and half hitches, laid on muchas the sinew on the sinew-back bow. This is very interesting. Length of shaft, 44 inches; foreshaft, 45 inches; point, 2 inches.
Example No. 129574, in the U. S. National Museum, is a barbed harpoon from Cape Krusenstern, Kotzebue Sound. The delicate shaft is conical in shape, tapering from the foreshaft backward, and slightly flattened in its thicker portion. It is socketed in the larger end for the reception of the foreshaft, and slightly stained red.
The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, cylindrical inshape. The tang fits in the open socket of the shaft, and on the outside the two bodies are trimmed down so as to form one continuous surface. Seizing of sinew twine. The socket for the point is quite large and extends across the wooden plug inserted in the end of the bone.
The hand rest is a slight hook of ivory set in the shaft, pierced with one triangular hole and held by a wrapping of sinew thread, which is also continued around the shaft a dozen times and fastened off by being punched into the wood.
The point is of bone, flat on one side and rounded on the other. Broad shank. Line hole almost circular. Barbs, three on one margin and two on the other. On the flat side of the point a shallow gutter is cut from the line hole forward. -
The line is of seal skin. One end passes through the line hole and is fastened by a common slip knot; the other end is made fast to the shaft, about 9 inches behind the hand rest, with a clove hitch of three turns.
The assembling line is of rawhide, one end caught under the seizing

between the shaft and foreshaft, and the other end pressed into a groove in the wood and held by a small wedge.
This delicate specimen is the only example of the class of barbed harpoons with hand rest coming from a point north of Bering Strait. Length of shaft, 4 feet 3 inches; foreshaft, 7 inches; point, 3 inches. Collected by Capt. M. A. Healy, of the U. S. Revenue Marine.
The harpoons of this area were fully described and figured by Nelson in 1899, who had the advantage of having seen the specimens at work. The massive harpoons of Greenland and the central Eskimo are wanting here, but the greatest variety of forms and parts is to be found. Again, if the flat varieties of eastern Asia, with line hole in the plane of the blade, are the more aboriginal, their nearest kin are to be seen, not in Bering Sea, but around Greenland. It is as when an Oxford professor, wishing to know something of his old-time kin, visits, not the nearest English town, but the heart of some New World colony. The Bering Sea Eskimo heve been profoundly affected by the vigorous prosecution of the fur trade during the past century and a half. The possession of steel tools has revolutionized their fine art; but, fortunately for this study, the harpoon has kept more loyally to its ancient models. There are barbed varieties, toggle varieties, and some are mixed. There are those which are thrust with the hands, others are hurled from the hand, and very many are cast from throwing sticks. Of this last-named implement a number of type forms are to be seen between Mackenzie River and Sitka. Here also will be found feathered harpoons, those with bladders attached to the shaft, and harpoon arrows. In the more southern portions of the Bering Sea area the harpoon attains a finesse in structure and appearance nowhere else seen. The collections from this area made by Nelson, Turner, Dall, Applegate, and Johnson are unparalleled for comparative study.
Among a large collection of these seal darts or barbed harpoons from Unalakleet, in the northeast corner of Norton Sound, a great majority have cylindrical foreshafts made of whale’s bone, but one or two specimens have the heads of walrus ivory and the front end tapered in conical form. Farther south this characteristic is more abundant. Barbs on the points are three on one margin and two on the other, and two on one margin and one on the other.
According to Lucien Turner, the harpoon darts with very thick foreshafts and elongated bladders attached to the shaft are for salmon. They are confined to Bristol Bay and the south side of the Alaskan peninsula, so far as the U. S. National Museum is concerned.
Cat. No. 33859 in the U. 8S. National Museum is a barbed harpoon thrown from the hand by means of a hand rest on the shaft. Quite similar is No. 36068, as shown in Plate 8, described in Nelson, 1899

<<<Page: 443>>>

(p. 138). Unless otherwise mentioned the specimens described below were collected by E. W. Nelson.
The shaft is of soft wood, tapering backward to a point, oval in cross section, and stained red in the front portion. For the attachment of the foreshaft a roughly conical socket is excavated, and on the upper side of this socket a slot is cut through from the outside. In the harpoons whose foreshafts are attached in this way this slot is universal—that is, the tang of the foreshaft is not driven into a cavity which it fits, but is set in a cavity with two margins which can be driven close together by the shrinkage of the seizing.
The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, nearly cylindrical, and cut off square in front. The tang is conoidal in form and terminates with a shoulder where it joins the body of the foreshaft. A plug of wood is inserted in the front end of the foreshaft, with a socket for the tang of the point. Feathers, none; but on the side of the shaft, just behind the center of gravity, is a flat piece of antler or bone set on and held in place by a lashing of rawhide thong. This serves as a stop for the end of the harpoon, the latter being driven like a javelin from the hand, without the use of a throwing stick of any kind.
The point is of bone, flattened on one side and round on the other, much larger than that of the variety hurled with a throwing stick. The shank is a flattened cone. Barbs, three on one margin and two on the other. In all of this class of harpoons the edges or sides of the point are sharp, and the margins of the barb are straight on one side _and curved on the other. The line hole is oblong.
The line is of rawhide thong, one end attached to the point and the other end to the shaft back of the middle by a clove hitch.
The assembling line *s fastened around the tang of the foreshaft near the shoulder and is continued back underneath the lashings, of different kinds, to near the top end, where it is driven into the wood and forms a smooth fastening.
Length of shaft, 52 inches. Length of foreshaft, 8 inches. Length of point, 4 inches. This specimen is from St. Michael. Collected by EK. W. Nelson.
A toggle-head harpoon (Cat. No. 33888, U.S.N.M.) ee Norton Sound is shown in fig. 81. The head is of ivory. The noticeable features about it are: The blade is in the same plane as the line hole; the line hole goes directly across the body of the head; the shallow socket is exactly behind it and in a line with the saw cut. There is a single barb or spur projecting behind the socket on top of the toggle head. The foreshaft is a long spindle of bone, tapering in front to fit the socket of the toggle head, and having a short cone at the base for the cavity in the end of the foreshaft. A hole is pierced through the foreshaft and a loop or becket passed through this opening and around the line, so that when the animal is struck the foreshaft is withdrawn from

the head and remains attached to the line. This feature should be carefully noted. The shaft is of wood, the foreshaft of ivory, and swollen or bulbous at the outer end. It fits into the wedge-shaped cut on the end of the shaft and is held tight by a lashing of rawhide. This lashing continues the whole length of the shaft, being caught around it at intervals with half hitches, forming an assembling line. Attached to the shaft is a hand rest about the center of gravity and a sharpened piece of bone at the other end. The line from the toggle head, after passing through the loop on the loose shaft, is attached to the shaft about the middle, so that the latter forms a drag when the animal is once struck. This implement is not thrown by means of a throwing stick, but from the hand of a hunter. Collected by E. W. Nelson.
A barbed harpoon (Cat. No. 33910, U.S.N.M.) from the Norton Sound area, to be thrown from the hand and not from a throwing stick, is shown in fig. 82. The shaft tapers from the front to the rear end, and has a hand rest on the side, held down by sinew thread. The foreshaft is a cylinder of | bone, and fits into the open socket of the shaft by | means of a projection or tenon. The harpoon head | is a barbed piece of bone. The line passes through | the line hole in the head and is wrapped several | times around the shaft, fastened off with a series of half hitches, and nearer to the butt end. The assembling line, in this example, is different from the one just described. When the animal is struck, the head is withdrawn from the foreshaft, the thong unwraps from the shaft, which stands straight in the water and acts as a drag to the captured animal. It is from St. Michael.
A barbed harpoon with hand rest (Cat. No. 33933, U.S.N.M.), from St. Michael, Alaska, is shown in Plate 9. The shaft is of pine wood, ellipticai in section, pointed in the rear, widening toward the middle and then narrowing again toward the foreshaft.

the foreshaft a gutter is carved to receive the knot in — the line. A hand rest on the middle of the shaft is triangular in outline, with a wavy margin and short flutings on the surface. It is pierced with three holes and set against the side of the shaft, where it is laid in place by wrappings of sinew thread. The fastening off of the lashing by being punched in the soft tissue of the wood is quite characteristic in Eskimo manufactures. The head has three barbs, one on one margin and two on the other, and is flattened on one side and angular on the other. The tang is flat and shouldered. The line hole is an oblong opening, just large enough to hold the rawhide thong and give it play. The line,which serves also for assembling line, is of stout sealskin. The small bladder is attached to the shaft. Its mouthpiece and lashings are well shown in the drawings.
Specimen No. 33948 in the U. S. National Museum is a bridle harpoon for a throwing stick, from the mouth of the Yukon River, collected by E. W. Nelson. The shaft is of light pine wood, top-shaped at the tip, suddenly narrowed, and then gradually widened to the butt end, where it is quite expanded. It is socketed for the shank of the foreshaft. The foreshaft is of ivory, attached to the shaft by a tang which fits into the socket. It is perforated just below the shoulder for the reception of a loop of rawhide, which is caught on either side under the seizing, binding the shaft and foreshaft together. This serves as an extra strengthening or as a retrieving device. The tip end of the foreshaft is tapered and a wooden plug inserted for the reception of the point. Two whole feathers are attached in the usual manner, punched into the wood, all their tip ends and the butt ends held down by a wrapping of the assembling line. The assembling line passes from the front end of the shaft to the inner end of the feathers. The point is of ivory, line hole oblong, tang conical, with a shoulder. Martingale of sinew string, the two ends fastened in the usual place— one near the foreshaft, the other back of the middle, fastened by a clove hitch. The assembling line acts as a lashing for the shaft and the foreshaft, passes backward by the regular series of half hitches, and is fastened, off at the butt end as a seizing to the feathers. Especial attention is called,to the hole near the tang
of the foreshaft; a similar hole is found through the inner end of the

<<<Page: 448>>>

foreshaft near the tang. This peculiarity is almost entirely confined to the area between Cape Dall and Nunivak. Length of shaft, 46 inches; foreshaft, 5 inches; point, 33 inches.
Specimen No. 33952 in the U. S. National Museum is a barbed harpoon without bridle for throwing stick, from Askeenuk, below Point Dall, collected by E. W. Nelson. The shaft is of light pine wood, nearly uniform thickness throughout, slightly expanded at the butt, and cut into a truncated wedge in front, which fits into a smaller slot in the foreshaft. The foreshaft is of ivory, almost cylindrical, and a little expanded in the front‘and tapering toward the tip, into which a plug of wood is inserted for the reception of the tang of the point. Into the butt end of the foreshaft is sawed a wedge-shaped slot on the ends of the wings. These formed projections are left for the lashing which joins the two parts together. The lashing is also held in place at the other extremity of the joint by shoulders on the foreshaft wrapped with sinew braid, which forms a strong joint. Three feathers are pressed into the wood near the butt end and wrapped with sinew braid at their inner extremities, the braid continuing to form the assembling line of the shaft. Here, as in other examples, a dozen or more turns are closely wrapped around the shaft about a foot from the end. The point is of bone. Barbs, three on one side and two on the other. Line hole oblong and quadrangular. Tang conical and shouldered. Through the line hole is fastened a narrow sealskin thong 3 feet or more long. This is attached by its other end around the shaft near the joint with the foreshaft by a clove hitch. When the point is driven into a seal.by means of a throwing stick, the tang is withdrawn from the foreshaft, which sinks in the water, and the shaft floats with the feathers upward to act as a buoy and also as a drag to slacken the pace of the animal. Similar to this are Nos. 33950, 33949, 33954, and 33955. In all of these the line is fastened to the shaft near the foreshaft. Length of shaft, 44¢ inches; foreshaft, 64 inches; point, 3 inches.
Examples Nos. 34004, 34011, 34016, 34020, 34002, 34008, 34017, 34022, 34018, 34001, 34023, 34014, 34003, 34021, 33992, 33991, 33999, 33994, 33978, and 33995 in the U. S. National Museum are barbed seal harpoons for throwing sticks, and form a large collection of these objects from various places around Norton Bay. They have foreshafts of whale’s bone, cylindrical, attached to the shaft by a shank fitted into a socket in the end of the shaft.
The shank of the foreshafteis somewhat wedge-shaped in cross section, the edge of which is run through a slot extending from the outside to the inside of the end of the shaft, to allow the shrinking of the sinew wrapping on the outside to bind all the parts strongly together.
Most of these specimens from this area have two feathers, though in some cases there is only one.

The head and contiguous parts of a small toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 37380, U.S.N.M.) for seal, from Chalitmut, collected by E. W. Nelson, is shown in fig. 83. The body of the head is of ivory, somewhat rectangular in cross section, but carved and flattened on both sides in parts of threes. The blade is set into a saw cut at the tip of the head and not held by any rivet. The socket for the loose shaft is a slender cone truncated within, the front end of the loose shaft being sawed off. The butt end of the body is beveled out. A long slope and
three barbs are formed at the hinder edge of |
this bevel and ornamented with concentric circles and lines. The line hole passes straight through the body, as in many other examples of this type. The loose shaft is a spindleshaped piece of bone, longer on the front slope. The hinder end is sharpened to fit into a groove. In the end of the foreshaft a hole is bored through the thick portion of the loose shaft, and through this hole and around the leader or line is formed a grommet of sinew cord. The two ends of the leader are overlapped and united by a notch.
A small toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 37395, U.S.N.M.) of the Alaskan Eskimo, at Chalitmut, on the north of Kuskokwim Bay, is shown in fig. 84. It is a type of the region and is made with a great deal of artistic skill. Blades are nowadays of brass, copper, and other metals, often of slate, inserted into a small toggle head of ivory transversely to the plane of the barbs, the plate intersecting the barb, which is bifurcated and sometimes trifurcated. The body is also ornamented with graceful lines, herring bone patterns, and circles. Into the socket of the headpiece is inserted the point of a small bone loose shaft, which fits by its lower end into a shallow socket of the foreshaft. Through the line hole of the head is a loop of rawhide, the ends neatly spliced together by a frapping with sinew string. The loose shaft is kept from being lost by a little grommet, made of sinew passing through

Catalogue No. 37955 is a toggle head of seal harpoon. The parts of this specimen which are attached are the head, with its loop or leader, and the loose shaft, with its. runner or grommet of rawhide passing over and inclosing the leader of the head.
The body is of bone or ivory in the form of a flattened cone. The spur is beveled and curved up at the point. Two delicate barbs are parallel on the outside and divided by a furrow along the back. Blade of iron, triangular, with convex edges, inserted in the blade slit and riveted. Plane of the blade parallel with the line hole. Shaft socket in the spur narrow and deep.

<<<Page: 451>>>

the shaft is a bone pick, attached by a wedge-shaped joint, the bone fitting into a kerf in the wood. The upper part of the pick is bored through for the assembling line. Around the joint is a lashing of baleen, neatly laid on, the assembling line being neatly interlaced with the wrapping. Especial attention is called to the fastening off and the knots on the shaft. The foreshafts of the large Bering Sea harpoons belong to the two quite distinct forms, the spindle-shaped and the conoidal. On the left side of Plate 10 is shown the form and mounting of a spindle-shaped loose shaft, and on the right side that of a conoidal form. In this example the projection is on the loose shaft and the socket in the foreshaft. In both forms a hole has been bored through the loose shaft for the assembling line. In these harpoons the heads belong to Murdoch’s later type; that is, the blade and line hole are in the same plane, at right angles to the longest diameter of the cross section of the toggle head. The blades of these harpoons are of slate, iron, brass, and, in a few specimens, of jade-like material. The toggle head is attached to the main line by means of what Murdoch calls the leader, which is a stout rawhide thong, 1 to 2 feet long, passed through the line hole, the two ends being overlapped and seized together; near the head a few turns of fine thong or sinew twine hold the two sides of the loop together, forming a becket. At the other end the leader is spliced into a becket on the end of the line. The line, when the head is ready for action is ‘‘ done up”

An artistic little toggle head of bone and iron from Cape Nome (Cat. No. 44484, U.S.N.M.), on the northern shore of Norton Sound, is shown in fig. 85. Body is somewhat pyramidal, the upper and lower surface being elegantly fluted and ridged. The blade is deltoid, with square butt and slightly convex margins, set deeply into the tapering point of the body in the plane of the line hole and fastened with a bone rivet. The line hole passes straight through the body of the toggle head, the ends being flanked by triangular line grooves. Barbs, twe cocked up and flared outward and bounded by the ornamental ridges, which closely follow the outlines of the back and terminate gracefully in the tips of the barbs. Butt end a curved plane, upright below and tapering above.

similar to the little seal harpoon heads of ivory—blade of iron, and bifurcated barbs, is shown in fig. 86.
Collected by E. W. Nelson. This is the last word in the inventional history of the toggle harpoon head. From this point it enters the world-embracing commerce, being cast in metal and sold to island peoples all about the Pacific Ocean. It has no voice in settling the question how far similarities in aboriginal arts argue for contact or sameness of mind
and its environments.
Specimens Nos. 45429 and 45430, in the U.S. National Museum, are barbed harpoons from Cape Nome, the northwestern corner of Norton Sound, Alaska. These are similar to the Sledge Island specimens without feathers, one of them having the assembling line of sinew thread and the other of rawhide.
The measurements of No. 45429 are: Shaft, 454 inches; foreshaft, 4 inches; point, 3inches. Measurements of No. 45430 are: Shaft, 46 inches; foreshaft, 4 inches; point, 2% inches.

outside, to allow for shrinkage in hafting. The foreshaft, as in most other specimens, is of whale’s bone and cylindrical. The shank for fastening to the shaft is shouldered and notched for the attachment of the assembling line. No feathers; but on another specimen, No. 48153, three half feathers, with plume inside, attached to their ends, as in example No. 129585, from Cape Blossom. The point is of bone, flat on one side and rounded on the other. Barbs, three on one margin and two on the other. The shank of the point is flat. The line is of dark seal rawhide, attached by one end through the line hole of the point by means of two double splices an inch apart. It is split near the middle, the two ends being fastened to the shaft about 18 inches apart by means of a clove hitch.
The front assembling line is looped around the shank of the foreshaft by a clove hitch wrapped around the end of the shaft to prevent slipping, and is continued to the upper attachment of the martingale. Between its two knots the martingale acts as an assembling line. From the hindmost knot of the martingale an assembling line of sinew thread proceeds backward for 4 inches, where a dozen turns are made and the end is punched into the wood near the end of the shaft. Between the two knots of the martingale the shaft has been mended by a series of half hitches and clove hitches made in sinew thread.
In specimen No. 48154, from the same locality, the upper assembling line is in fine seal rawhide. Length of shaft, 46 inches; foreshaft, 4 inches; point, 3 inches.
Specimen No. 48365 in the U.S. National Museum is a barbed harpoon for throwing stick, from Nunivak Island, south of Yukon mouth. The shaft is of soft wood, nearly uniform in thickness throughout, truncated and wedge-shaped at the upper extremity to fit into a corresponding cut in the foreshaft. Especial attention might be called to the expansion of the small end of the wedge to correspond with depressions in the shouldering on the parts of the foreshaft which overlap the wedge, in order to prevent the joint from coming apart. This isa step toward a dovetail.
The foreshaft is of walrus ivory, slightly expanded in front and conoid on the top. The tang has a wedge-shaped saw cut to fit on the end of the shaft. The two flanges are shouldered where they join the body of the foreshaft, and have notches cut on them at the outer extremity for the lashing. This is driven on the end of the shaft and the two are seized together by means of sinew braid laid on neatly. A small plug of wood is inserted in the outer end of the foreshaft, having a conical socket for the butt end of the barb.
At the base of the shaft there are two sets of black feathers, one ubove the other. Each feather is whole, its inner end seized to the shaft by means of the assembling line, which is wrapped several times

around. The top ends of the feathers are firmly driven into holes in the wood.
The head is of ivory, flat on one face and angular on the other. The shank is nearly conical, fitting into the socket of the foreshaft. Line hole elongated. Barbs, three on one margin and two on the other.
The line or martingale of the harpoon is of rawhide; the undivided end is passed through the line hole of the head and tied in a bowline knot. The two ends of the martingale are attached to the shaft near the feather and near the foreshaft by clove hitches. The sinew braid by means of which the shaft and foreshaft are seized together is continued on toward the feathers, with here and there a half hitch, until it reaches the rear feathers, where it forms the seizing, and then passes backward to become the seizing of the front set of feathers, and it is fastened on by being punched into the wood in a similar way to the top end of the feathers.
Among the Eskimo tools there is a little ivory point belonging to the outfit of the bow-and-arrow maker, used especially for making holes in soft wood, into which the ends of feathers and lines are punched to forma smooth fastening. It seems to be very effective.
-Length of shaft, 3 feet 7 inches; length of foreshaft and shank,
7# inches; length of point, 3 inches. Collected by E. W. Nelson.
A sea-otter harpoon dart Pishudak, (Cat. No. 72415, U.S.N.M.), from Bristol Bay, Alaska, is shown in Plate 12. In its composition it resembles a large number of specimens used in an important industry. It will be described, therefore, in detail. The head is of ivory, flat on one side and angular in section on the other. There are three barbs, two on the left margin, one on the right; the line hole is oblong. The tang fitting into a socket at the end of the foreshaft is a little cone, shouldered above. The line is of braided sinew, fastened into the line hole of the barbed head by a bend and knot. The other end in this and kindred specimens has not the martingale, but is tied to the shaft near the middle of the bladder. When the animal is struck, the barbed head pulls out from the foreshaft, the line unrolls from the shaft, the bone head drops, and the bladder rises. The apparatus acts then both as a drag anda signal. The foreshaft, of bone, is bill-shaped, cut off square at the base, excepting a slight tenon in form of a cylinder to fit into a socket at the front end of the shaft. In the front end of the foreshaft a cylinder of pine wood is set, and this must be noted on all barbed harpoons. The purpose is to give the tang of the head a firmer hold when the weapon is ready for-action. The shaft of this and other like specimens is of wood, tapering just slightly from front to rear. The socket for the tenon of the foreshaft is carefully bored, and wrapped with sinew braid. The same braid is continued down the shaft for assembling line, and serves also for attaching the float, which in all small harpoons of this class is made from

<<<Page: 459>>>

bladders, stomachs, or intestines of seal or walrus. They are cleaned out, one end fastened up securely, and into the other a mouthpiece with plug is set for purpose of inflation. The subject is discussed by Nelson.' In the example shown the process of inserting astud or plug into the float where it has been pierced is illustrated. Length of shaft, 44 inches; length of foreshaft, 25 inches; length of barb, 4% inches. Specimen No. 11356 is quite similar. Length of shaft, 464 inches; length of foreshaft, 3 inches.
Examples No. 8004 to 8007 in the U.S. National Museum are feathered harpoon darts from Bristol Bay. The shaft is very little expanded in front and slightly expanded atthe nock. Thereare three half feathers neatly trimmed and bound on in front by the assembling line which is also used to seize the foreshaft, wrapped around the shaft and ends at the feathers. The feathers are seized at the nock with a strip of split quill and are further held in place by a thread which holds the midrib of the feather to the shaft of the dart at five places. The feather seizing at the nock is noticeable in all of these specimens and separates them from the others in the collection.
The foreshaft, of ivory, is conical, smaller at the butt end, where it is inserted into the shaft by means of a shoulder plug which is driven: into the socket at the end of the shaft. The front end of the foreshaft is abruptly conical and finished off witha wooden plug which has a pit or socket for the barbed point. The point is of bone and has two barbs on one side and one on the other. Length of shaft, 444 inches; of foreshaft, 54 inches; of point, 3 inches. Collected by Dr. T. T. Minor. Similar to these are Nos. 19378 and 19380, collected by the Rev. James Curley, having in all respects the same characteristics, excepting that the seizing at the nock is not of quill, but a continuation of the thread which holds the shaft of the feather to the shaft of the spear.
Plate 13 (Cat. No. 90416, U.S.N.M.) is a sea-otter spear from Ugashik, Bristol Bay, Alaska. The shaft is of wood, tapering from the fore end to the rear end. The head is of bone and has two barbs on one margin and one on the other. The line hole is small and has no line grooves. The tang is whittled off thin to fit into a delicate socket on the end of the shaft. The leader or loop on the barbed head is a narrow strip of sealskin doubled through the line hole and seized together. The ends are also united in such a way that the loop is closed in the middle. At the other end the thong is doubled, passed through an eyelet, over the projecting point to form a ‘‘detacher.” On the shaft at five places are bands of birch bark and around these are wrapped sinew twine in half hitches for the purpose of retrieving the parts of the shaft if it should be broken. The bladder is a portion of the intestine of a seal, having

a delicate mouthpiece of ivory, neatly set on to the side of the shaft by wrappings of sinew thread passed through two holes bored in its upper portion. The other end of the bladder is bound to the rawhide thong, which is secured by being pushed under the wrapping of sinew thread between it and the birch-bark packing. The line is of rawhide and is securely fastened to the ‘‘detacher” at one end by a bend, which is held in place by a figure-of-8 wrapping of sinew thread. The rest of the line is wound about the shaft when the spear is ready for action, the other end being attached to the shaft between the two ends of the bladder. When the animal is struck, the head unships, the line unrolls, the head of the shaft drops into the water and the whole acts as a drag and a signal to show the position of the game.
Examples Nos. 90417 to 90419 in the U.S. National Museum are feathered sea-otter harpoon darts from Ugashik, north of the Alaskan peninsula. The shaft is of light pine wood, very nearly cylindrical, and tapering slightly toward the front. The foreshaft is of bone and has a plug on the inner or butt end which fits into a socket on the end of the shaft, and the joint is seized by a fine sinew or intestine braid, the inner end of which is continued backward with half hitches for an assembling line. Near the feather a band of this braid an inch in width is formed, and 4 inches above the feather is another one around the inner end to the feathers. There are three feathers, seized in front by the assembling line, and at the nock .by a separate wrapping of braid. They are split and further held down by a light thread, which binds the shaft of them to the shaft of the dart in five places by half hitches.
This method of attaching the feathers is found in Nos. 8004 to 8006 and seems to be typical of the region.
The line or martingale is attached to the shaft 4 inches behind the foreshaft and 4 inches in front of the feather. The point is small and has three barbs on one side, and is attached to the line by means of a hole bored in the shank and fitted into the foreshaft by a tang which is nearly cylindrical. Length of shaft, 4 feet; of foreshaft, 54 inches; of point, 1? inches. Collected by William J. Fisher.
The darts are called Nagik kujat; the bone foreshaft, Mamkuk; the line, Punak; the bone head, Kugichalugak; the feathers, Nakchute.
A complete toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 160337, U.S.N.M.), with line float and line board, from Kusilvak, at the mouth of the Yukon River, in Alaska, is shown in Plates 14 to 15. The toggle head shown in Plate 15 is of ivory, a delicate object, perfect in all its details. In outline it resembles the head of a duck. The blade is set into the saw-cut at the point of the body, and in the plane of the line hole, which is bored straight through from margin to margin. The barb is cut into three points, which form a part of the ornamentation. Through the line hole passes a long loop, which is neatly spliced at its ends and wrapped

and knotted so as to keep it in shape. At its other extremity it unites with the end of a long rawhide line, which in turn is looped at its other end to a becket or loop of sealskin float, and frequently an additional line is spliced between the two. This line rests upon a flat board frame, which is thus described.’
The float board consists of a strong, oval hoop of spruce made in two U-shaped pieces, with the ends brought together and beveled to form a neatly-fitting joint, which is wrapped firmly with a lashing of spruce root; the sides have holes by which a thin board is fastened to the under side, the ends of which are notched in front to form a coarsely serrated pattern with five points that are inserted in slots cut in the front of the hoop. The front of the board is oval, and the sides taper gradually to the points of two projecting arms, which extend 4 or 5 inches below the bow; between these arms a deep slot is cut, with the inner border rounded. The board has a round hole in the center and a crescentic hole on each side (Plate LIV, fig. 10).
On the kaiak the float board is placed in front of the hunter with the arm-like points thrust beneath the cross lashing to hold it in position, and upon it lies the coil of float line with the spear attached and resting on the spear guards on the right rail of the boat; the end of the line is passed back under the hunter’s right arm to the float, which, fully inflated, rests on the deck just back of the manhole.
When the spear is thrown, the coil runs off rapidly and the float is thrown overboard. In some cases, when the prey is vigorous and leads a long pursuit, another line, like that shown in figure 9, Plate LIV, is made fast through the semilunar orifices in the center of the float board, which latter, when drawn through the water by means of this cord, assumes a position nearly at a right angle to the course of the animal and forms a heavy drag to impede its progress.
When hunting on the ice, the float board, with the line coiled upon it, is carried in the left hand of the hunter and the spear in the right hand while he watches along the borders of the leads or holes for the appearance of the seals. When he succeeds in striking one, he holds firmly to the line until the animal is exhausted, or, if necessary, the float board attached to the line is cast into the water, while the hunter hurries to his kaiak and embarks in pursuit.
In plate 15 will be shown the method of uniting the toggle head with the loose shaft, this with the fore shaft, and the fore shaft with the shaft. This last joint is worthy of study, with its curious tenon and shoulder fitting into a socket at the end of the shaft. Especial attention is called to the manner in which the shaft is cut away a short distance on the outside to allow the lashing of sinew to draw the joint perfectly tight. Attention is also called to the method of fitting the splicing, at which the Eskimo are quite adept. On the surface of the fore shaft the dot and ring ornamentsoccur. This decoration, wherever found, isan emblem of the existence of steel tools. Very little ornament exists on the old Eskimo weapons found in localities away from contact.
The head of a toggle harpoon (Cat. No. 168625, U.S.N.M) from Bristol Bay, collected by William J. Fisher, is shown in fig. 88. The head is of bone, back sharp edged, front rounded, and the whole a flattened wedge shape at right angles to the line hole. The blade, of slate, is triangular, with convex sides, and glued into a saw cut in the end of the head. This socket for the loose shaft is square in section and shallow. The butt end of the body is beveled as in most harpoons of this class, but in such manner as to form an offset on the margin of the socket, and

the single barb is formed by the meeting of the sharp back with the
two edges of this bevel. The line hole passes straight through the body and is flanked by shallow wide grooves. The loose shaft is a piece of pine wood flattened and wedge-shaped at its butt end to fit into a wide socket at the end of the foreshaft, shouldered about 2 inches from this end and then tapering to the point of juncture with the body of the toggle head. The loose shaft passes into the shallow socket of the head, where it is hinged. A rawhide thong is passed through the line hole and tightly seized on either side of the loose shaft 3 inches below its outer end. This forms a hinge, so that when the body of the toggle head is drawn down the point of the loose shaft comes out of the socket, and the parts are held together by the wrapping or seizing. The two are further secured together by a grommet of spruce root. When in rest the wedge-shaped butt end of the loose shaft passes between the two sides of the rawhide line, and in unhinging from the toggle head this part also flies out in an opposite direction. At the end of the rawhide line is a loop for the attachment of a longer line.
This old example is very interesting indeed, forming a connecting link between the Eskimo toggle head and the forms allied to it among the Indian tribes farther south. Length of head and blade, 64 inches; loose shaft, 94 inches.
Plates 16 and 17 (Cat. Nos. 16407, 19382, and 72412, U.S.N.M.) show the forms of harpoon arrows in use on the north and the south side of the Alaskan peninsula. The last mentioned, No. 6 on the plate, from Bristol Bay, is farthest removed from the arrow and nearest the harpoon with its club-shaped head and bilateral barbs. The line hole in the barbed head, the line running from head to shaft, the socket for the head, the joint between head and shaft, are all suggestive of the small seal harpoon. No. 5 on the plate, from Cook Inlet, in its head approaches very near to the simplicity of the Fuegian barbed harpoon. The half feathers set on radially are more Indian than Eskimo. Fig. 4o0n Plate 16 is the delicate sea-otter arrow from Kadiak, the paragon of aboriginal projectiles. The specimen is fully illustrated on Plate 17.
This is the most elaborate and ingenious arrow known, and all of its parts, in every specimen, are most delicately finished. Such a weapon may well have been

used in hunting the most costly of fur-bearing animals—the otter.

The shaft is of spruce, gently tapering toward the neck, which is large and bell shaped. Into the end of the shaft is inserted a foreshaft of bone, and into the end of this fits the barb. Feathers, three, symmetrically trimmed and seized at both ends with delicately twisted sinew thread. The barbed head is perforated, and through these perforations is attached a braided line at least 10 feet long. The other end of the shaft is secured to two points on the shaft by a martingale. When not in use the line is coiled neatly on the shaft and the barb is put in place in the foreshaft. When the arrow is shot, the barb enters the flesh of the otter, the loose fastening is undone, the line unrolled, the foreshaft drops into the water; the shaft acts as a drag and the feathers as a buoy to aid the hunter in tracing the animal. (See Plate Lu, fig. 4.)

Fig. 2. The shaftment. Attention is drawn to the delicate seizing with sinew thread, the natty trimming of the feather, the most efficient nock.
Fig. 3. The lines and knots. Notice is given of the elegance of the braid, the efficient manner of ‘‘doing up” the line, the peculiar knot for the martingale.
Fig. 4. The arrow ready to be shot.
This form of arrow, with its southern type of sinew-backed bow, is found also on the Kuriles, where they were taken by Aleuts, carried over by the Russians to hunt sea-otter.
The arrows numbered 1, 2, and 3 in Plate 16 are from the same areas as the harpoon arrows just described, namely, from Bristol Bay to Kadiak. The heads are essentially those of harpoons, and are set into the ends of the shafts in the loosest manner by a slight conical projection fitting into a socket. When the animal is struck the head withdraws itself and remains in the wound. A short piece of string between head and shaft would convert these three missiles into harpoon arrows. To make the likeness more complete, No. 3 has a wooden cap over the blade.
Cat. No. 72518 in the U. 8. National Museum is a sea-otter harpoon dart or Pishudak from Chernoborn Island, Cook Inlet. The bladder, — shaft, assembling line, foreshaft, martingale, and barb are similar to the others in all respects excepting the attachment of the foreshaft to the shaft. A projection from the butt of the ivory foreshaft forms a wedge which tapers in two directions. In fact, the foreshaft is dovetailed into the end of the shaft and seized with a sinew braid or sennit, which acts as the assembling line. See Plate 16 for details of Cat. No. 19382, a harpoon arrow from the same locality. Length of shaft, 45% inches; of foreshaft, 3 inches; of point, 5 inches. Collected by William J. Fisher.

otter dart from Unalaska. The shaft is of spruce wood; it is light and
delicately made, not quite cylindrical, but becoming thicker toward the front. The foreshaft is of whale’s bone, thicker where it joins the shaft, tapering smaller towards the front,and expanding at the tip end; flattened a little in cross section. A plug of wood is inserted in the socket at the tip end. The point of ivory has two barbs on one side and one on the other, and an extension or knob at the butt end, around which the line is fastened by a marlin hitch. The line is of sinew braid or sennit three-ply in the open parts, and six-ply between the martingale and the point. ‘The martingale is tied, one end around the foreshaft and the other a little back of the middle of the shaft, by a clove hitch.
The shaft has in front a wedge with square front and shouldered in the rear. This wedge fits exactly into a slot in the butt end of the foreshaft. A small piece of birch bark is wrapped around the joint for packing and all the parts seized together very neatly with the finest sinew thread.
In this example, as in all others of its class, the shaft is painted red; on some of them the paint extends to the foreshaft. On a few examples bands of black paint are added at the butt end. Length of shaft, 42 inches; of foreshaft, 7; inches; of point, 24 inches.
Feathers on the shaftment or butt end of the shaft, three, set on radially. The nock of this specimen is not unlike the foreshaft in form, only, in place of the notch to fit the bow string, there is a flat cone on the tip end with a small pit on the end to catch into the ivory hook on the foreshaft. By comparing this specimen with the harpoon arrows in Plates 16 and 17 the student has the best possible opportunity of seeing the close kinship between the harpoon and the arrow. It is entirely a matter of propulsion, whether from the hand, from a ° bow, or from an atlatl or throwing stick.
Plate 19 (Cat. No. 11362, U.S.N.M.) represents a barbed harpoon with bladder and hand rest. From Kadiak, and collected by Vincent Colyer.
The shaft is of pine wood, tapering gradually from the point to the butt. At the front end the shaft is widened out into a cylindrical form for about 2 inches and notched in like a spool. There is no foreshaft in this specimen. The socket for the point is lenticular in cross section and the spool-shaped space is filled with a wrapping of fine sinew braid. The shaft is ornamented with rings and longitudinal stripes in black, and the space between the two attachments of the martingale is painted solid black.
The point is of walrus ivory or hard bone, delicately made. There are two barbs on one side near the butt, which at a side view resemble the hoof of an animal. At the inner margin of one of these, three little dots and lines are added by way of ornament. On the

<<<Page: 473>>>

other side is a small barb or hook, which could scarcely be of any
use. The tang is not tapered or shouldered, but is quite wide. The line hole is round, and into it is set a thong of rawhide, doubled and joined together at its ends and likewise near the barb by a lashing of sinew thread. Just above the point, where the two ends of the thong are bound together with sinew thread, a braided cord of sinew passes between the two ends of the thong and is made fast by a half hitch, a knot being tied in the end of the braid to prevent its coming undone. The braid constitutes the line of the harpoon. A few feet from the point, where the braid is attached to the rawhide leader of the barbed head, it is separated into two smaller braids, and these become the branches of the martingale, the ends of which are attached, one under the bridle, the other 3 feet from the front end of the shaft. The hand rest is a short piece of the black horn of the mountain goat. Its base fits on the shaft. Through a hole in this horn a lashing of sinew thread passes around the shaft several times. The bladder has at one end a delicate mouthpiece of ivory set against the shaft, held in place by sinew thread passing through perforations in the mouthpiece. At the other end the bladder is attached to the shaft by means of a rawhide thong tied a few inches away. At five different places on the shaft, namely, the two points of attachment for the martingale, the place of the hand rest, and the two points of attachment for the bladder, are bands of white birch bark, which serve both for ornament and as a soft packing to hold the different lashings in place. The manner in which the line is done up on the shaft when the harpoon is ready for action, by means of a loose knot, which is easily untied, is shown.
In every respect this is a well-made and graceful implement. Length
of shaft, 8 feet 5 inches; point, 8 inches.
The Samoyed harpoon, on the testimony of Nordenskiold, consists of a large and strong iron head, very sharp on the outer edge and provided with a barb. The head is loosely fixed to the shaft, but securely fastened to the end of a slender line 10 fathoms long, generally made of walrus hide. The line is fastened at its other end to the boat, in the fore part of which it lies in a carefully arranged coil. There are from five to ten such harpoon lines in every hunting boat. When the hunters see a herd of walrus, either on a piece of drift ice or in the water, they endeavor, silently and against the wind, to approach sufliciently near to one of the animals to be able to harpoon it. If this succeeds, the walrus first dives and then endeavors to swim under water all he can. But he is fixed with the line to the boat and must draw it along. His comrades swim toward the boat, curious to ascertain the cause of the alarm. A new walrus is transfixed with another harpoon, and so it goes on until, one after another, all the harpoons are in use. The boat is now drawn forward at a whizzing speed, although the row ers hold back with the oars; but there is no actual danger so long as

all the animals draw in the same direction. If one of them seeks to take a different course from that of his comrades’ in misfortune his line must be cut off, otherwise the boat capsizes. When the walruses get exhausted by their exertions and by loss of blood, the hunters begin to haul in the lines. One animal after another is drawn to the stem of the boat, and there they commonly first get a blow on the head with the flat of a lance, and when they turn to guard against it a lance is thrust into the heart.’ Whatever view one takes regarding the blood kinship between the peoples of northeastern Asia and those of North America, or between the languages of the two areas, the kinship of inventions is not to be denied. How far a device may travel or be transmitted without changing so much as one word in any language or one drop of blood is not known. A whale has been known to carry a harpoon head half wav around the world and deliver it safely to a company of natives on the other side; and a throwing stick, with which harpoons are hurled, drifted from Bering Strait to western Greenland. The harpoon has been briefly traced throughout the Western Hemisphere.

in former times, and traded to the Eskimo for valuable furs. In the National Museum there is among the Nelson collection a small toggle head of cast iron all in one piece, fig. 86, the model of which was a native example of ivory and iron.
Fig. 90 is taken from Schrenk,* and shows the same invasion of iron into native arts. The object is a combined barbed and toggle head, in which, however, the barbs play the chief part. The leader, of rawhide, preserves its ancient bends and knots, and the. eyes peeping from the foreshaft are certainly survivals of the ancient régime.

of iron. It is impossible to conceive of a more excellent illustration of the fading out of an ancient vee form and the gradual introduction of new elements.
_ The bone foreshaft (Cat. No. 72403, US .N.M.) of a large whaling or walrus harpoon from Bristol Bay is oon in fig. 92. It is the last expression in the use of modern tools for the preparation of a very ancient device. If this be compared with the gash in the end of the Fuegian harpoon, it will be seen that great progress has been made at this particular point. The upper part is carefully turned and the lower part cut with a tenon, so formed that when placed at the end of the shaft the strain in every direction is provided for. Collected by Charles L. M. McKay.
The harpoon is the most complicated of the devices invented by uncivilized peoples. In a hemisphere capable of awakening every kind of human wants and needs, furnishing an infinite variety of supplies to these from place to place, providing one sort of materials for the harpoon here and quite another sort there, inhabited by native tribes endowed with great range of genius, it would be expected that a universal weapon should take on every possible form. Just as the whale ship of yesterday, its friend and contemporary, has been replaced by the ship driven by steam, so the Eskimo at present kills the seal, the walrus, the whale, and the arctic land mammals with a rifle and explosive cartridges instead of the ancient harpoon. Should the Eskimo use his great weapon at all, it will be, as Murdoch shows, to retrieve his game on the edge of the ice after it is shot, and not as a killing device.
Both the ship and the harpoon served benevolent purposes, since they fostered and stimulated ingenuity until the fullness of time for steamships and firearms arrived. The harpoon is the climax of piercing inventions, which include daggers, lances, spears, javelins, and arrows of all kinds—held in the hand, hurled from the hand, either unaided or with the help of hand rest, amentum or atlatl, or shot from a bow. As was noted in the preceding drawings and descriptions, the harpoon had no limit in its application, being equally efficient on the land, in the air, in the water, or through the ice, at long range or short range, with short or long shaft, in some examples this part a hundred feet in length. The simplest forms have three rude parts; the most highly developed a score or more. Besides its own complexity, it has in the arctic area dominated the kaiak in its upper part, as well as the dress of the man, and called forth any number of accessories for decoying, finding, watching, taking out of the water, and carrying home.
When it is remembered that every part of this complex apparatus

<<<Page: 483>>>

must be most efficacious for its region and quarry, and not bulky, one is not astonished to find a great variety of patterns in the structure and
in the knots on the lines. The Eskimo themselves were not all agreed
on these points. Hence, for example, Murdoch discusses the question whether the blade of the toggle head should be in the plane of the line hole or across-it. Again, the length of the shaft and other characteristics were, in certain limits, fitted to the hunter. One has only to look through Nelson’s plates to be convinced that there was a range of individual choice in many parts. While, therefore, it is correct to say that all harpoons of the different types resemble one another in the same area, it is equally proper to add that no two harpoons are alike.
Besides the lesson in the history of invention which this study affords, other questions arise. What help do these technical specimens offer to the ethnologist and the archeologist in deciding race, language, migrations, and antiquity? Can it be said of a harpoon, or some of its parts, found without label in a collection, that it was made by this or that tribe, or that it came from a certain area? Or, if ina shell heap or village site or grave certain harpoon parts are found, will a comparison with the drawings o¥ descriptions in this paper tell who the makers of these relics might have been? In the first place, if the technical products of peoples now living are to throw light upon ethnic and archeologic investigations, these products must be collected in large numbers and the identity of those who made and used them must be settled beyond controversy. With reference to precious material gathered after the discovery and scattered in private and public collections, it is safe to label them as to tribe and locality by the help of specimens lately acquired by scientific collectors. In this way the mouths of these dumb witnesses will be opened. It must not be forgotten, however, that unity of race is a matter of blood, of kinship; that unity of speech is a matter of lip and ear, and requires some close contact; while unity of industry is a matter of eye and hand and may be easily communicated from afar.
On the question, how much of all this invention is of native growth and what proportion is exotic, wide differences of opinion still exist.
To begin with, all iron and all work of iron are in a sense new, added, accultural; not out and out, but in varying proportion and for the most part merely substitutional. The iron blade takes the place of a stone blade only as a better stone. It is hammered and ground similarly. The simple tools alter shapes but little; they merely cut, saw, grind, and pierce better than the old. But a more vigorous substitution took place in the barter of devices between savage tribes widely separated, but made acquainted, first in their own commerce, and afterwards by the fishing and fur trading interests of the white settlers. .

By Aurrep E. Hippisiey, Commissioner of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service of China.
For such’ information as we possess regarding the history of the ceramic art in China, we have till recently been chiefly indebted to the labors of the famous French sinologue, M. Stanislas Julien, who, under the title of L’Histoire et la Fabrication de la Porcelaine Chinoise, translated, and published in 1856, the History of the Manufactory of Chingté-chén (a small town in Kiangsi province, but for centuries the most important seat of the Chinese porcelain industry), a work written by a local magistrate in 1815 from older documents, and to the valuable letters from the same town written in 1712 and 1722 by the Jesuit missionary Pere d’Entrecolles, the priest in charge there, which have been published in the collection of Lettres édifiantes et curieuses. Within the past three years, however, very valuable additional light has been shed upon this subject by the labors of two gentlemen who are at once collectors and Chinese scholars, S$. W. Bushell, M. D., physician to H. B. M. legation, Pekin, and F. Hirth, Ph. D., a member of the imperial maritime customs service of China. Doctor Bushell has been fortunate enough to secure from among the dispersed library of the Prince of I the manuscript of a descriptive catalogue (of which native experts see no reason to doubt the authenticity), with illustrations painted in water-color, of eighty-two celebrated specimens of old porcelain seen in the collections of noted connoisseurs or possessed by the author himself, one Hsiang Yitan-p’ien (styled Tzii-ching), a native of Tsui-li, an
‘In 1887 Mr. A. E. Hippisley, a commissioner of the imperial maritime customs service of China, deposited in the U. 8. National Museum a large and important collection of Chinese porcelains, with the understanding that the Museum should print a descriptive catalogue, which it did in the Annual Report for 1887-88. The edition of this catalogue having long ago been exhausted, and the demand for it having recently increased, owing to the current interest in all matters relating to China, it is now republished with emendations and with the addition of a number of plates illustrating type examples from the various provinces represented.

ancient name of Chiaho, now Chiahsing-fu, in Chehkiang province, who was a celebrated collector of all kinds of antiquities during the latter half of the sixteenth century. A translation of this work, with exp!anatory details by Doctor Bushell, has been published in the journal of the Pekin Oriental Society, under the title of Chinese Porcelain before the Present Dynasty, and it is, I believe, to be shortly republished in an amplified form with reproductions of the original drawings. Should this be done, the work would, in my opinion, form by far the most important and valuable contribution to our knowledge of this interesting subject. The information regarding Chinese porcelain which has been bequeathed to us by native authors is to be found in their encyclopedias or in special treatises chiefly based upon the encyclopedias. These are, however, compilations of such vast extent that the authors had not, nor could be expected to have, the intimate knowledge of an expert upon all of the very many subjects treated in them. Hearsay evidence or unverified rumors have thus but too often been allowed to crystallize into permanent record, with the result that it is impossible after an interval of centuries to attempt to reconcile the many contradictions of statement contained in the different works. In this catalogue, however, are contained the reproductions in color of eighty-two specimens of the choicest productions of a period extending over upward of five centuries, from A. D. 960 to 1521, either possessed or seen by the artist, and scattered notes from the pen of one of the most noted connoisseurs of his age regarding the respective merits and rarity of the various kinds of ware. Existing realities are presented to us in place of the vague generalities and contradictory essays of the encyclopedists, and there can, I apprehend, be little doubt as to the comparative value of the two varieties of evidence. Doctor Hirth’s contribution—Chinese Porcelain: A Study in Chinese Medieval Industry and Trade—is an important paper, treating chiefly of Chinese céladon porcelain and its distribution over the Mobammedan world.
According to the legendary records of the prehistoric period of Chinese chronology, porcelain was already manufactured under Huang-ti, an emperor who is said to have entered upon a reign of one hundred years in B. C. 2697; and the Emperor Yu-ti-Shun, another monarch of the legendary period, is believed to have himself made — porcelain before mounting the throne in B. C. 2255. Under the succeeding dynasty of fe te mention is made of an official director of pottery, and the processes of fashioning on the wheel and of molding are distinguished; sacrificial wine jars and altar dishes, coffins, cooking utensils, and measures being mentioned among the articles produced. Later Chinese writers have, however, long admitted that

the productions of that age could only have been of earthenware (possibly glazed), and that no greater antiquity can be claimed for the manufacture of real porcelain than the reign of the Han dynasty, which held the throne of China from B. C. 202 to A. D. 220, and that after this date progress in the system of manufacture was for a long period but slow. At one time, early in the present century, European archeologists were inclined to believe than an antiquity might be conceded to Chinese porcelain almost equal to the wildest claims of Chinese historians.’ Some small porcelain bottles, decorated with flowers and inscriptions in Chinese, having been brought to Europe by M. Rosellini, who stated that they had been found in undisturbed Egyptian tombs dating from at least 1800 B. C., it was concluded that the manufacture of porcelain must have existed in China anterior to that date. M. Julien discovered, however, that the inscriptions upon these bottles were written in the cursive character, a style of writing not introduced till B. C. 48; and later Mr. (afterwards Sir Walter) Medhurst, then an interpreter in the Hongkong government service, was able with Chinese aid to identify the inscriptions with quotations from poems written during the T'ang dynasty, and later than the seventh century of the Christian era. Any title to such great antiquity in the manufacture of Chinese porcelain, based on these bottles, which had evidently been surreptitiously introduced into the tombs by Arabs, thus fell to the ground. Indeed, M. du Sartel, who has published an exhaustive work on La Porcelaine de la Chine, argues that the manufacture of true porcelain in China did not begin till some centuries later tuan the period assigned to it by M. Julien, who dates it from the reign of the Han dynasty and somewhere between the years B. C. 185 and A. D. 87. This point will be considered when we come to the reign of the T‘ang dynasty, the period in which M. du Sartel claims true porcelain was first made.
It is during the Han dynasty that mention is first made of 72*v, the Chinese designation of porcelain. It was then made at Hsinp‘ing, a district in the State of Ch‘en, and corresponding with the modern Huaining district, in Honan province.
Under the Wei dynasty, which from A. D. 221 to 265 enjoyed, with the dynasties of Wu and of Han of Szechuen, divided supremacy as rulers of China, manufactories are mentioned at several places in the department of Hsi-an, in Shensi province (the products of which were known as Kuanchting-yao), and at Loyang, in Honan province (products termed Loching-t‘ao), as supplying porcelain for the imperial palace.

Under the Chin dynasty (A. D. 266 to 419) another manufactory is mentioned as existing in the present department of Wénchou, in Chehkiang province, which produced porcelain (known as Tung-ou t‘ao) of a blue (or possibly céladon) color which was held in high esteem. '
Under the Sui dynasty, in spite of its short-lived existence, considerable progress appears to have taken place. Mention is made of a green porcelain manufactured under the directions of Ho Chou or Ho Kuei-lin, president of the board of works, to replace glass, the method of making which had been forgotten ‘* since its introduction into China by Indian or Syrian artisans about A. D. 424.”" <A celebrated workman, named T‘ao Yii,” is said to have produced porcelain so like jade, that is, semitransparent and of vitreous appearance, that his vases were known as ‘‘artificial jade;” and about the close of this or the beginning of the following dynasty porcelain, white in color and bright as jade (known as Ho-yao, i. e., Ho porcelain), was manufactured by Ho Chung-ch‘u, a workman who came from Hsinp’ing, the district where porcelain (¢z‘7) had its first origin under the Han dynasty. An imperial decree of 583 ordered the establishment of a manufactory at the place now known as Chingté-chén (so named from the title of the period,’ Chingté, in which it was inaugurated) for articles for the use of the imperial household, and several others sprang up in the vicinity shortly afterwards.
1F. Hirth, China and the Roman Orient, pp. 230 et seq.
* The producer’s reputed name, meaning as it does ‘‘faience or kiln jade,’’ sounds apocryphal, and seems more likely to have been the term by which this ware was known.
*It being contrary to etiquette to mention the personal name of a Chinese sovereign, the practice was introduced B. C. 163, under the earlier Han dynasty, of the monarch, on his accession to the throne, selecting some title for his reign in place of the title of Prince so-and-so, which had been usually employed prior to the time of Shih Huangti, B. C. 221. These titles were usually so chosen as to be of happy augury, but if, in spite of such good omen, disorder or misfortune ensued or some other reason seemed to render a change advisable, one title would be abandoned in favor of another. This title is termed nien-hao, ‘“‘the year designation,’’ because so long as it lasted the date of all events was chronicled as such and such a year of such and such a title, or nien-hao. Upon his death, however, the emperor received an honorific title, and but one title, no matter how many nien-hao, or ‘‘year designations,” he may have employed while alive, under which the religious ceremonies due to him were offered, and which is therefore termed the miao-hao, or ‘‘temple designation.”’ Thus it results that when in Chinese literature a deceased emperor is personally alluded to he is spoken of under his ‘‘temple designation,’’ while if the date of an event which occurred during his reign is quoted it is said to have taken place in such and such a year of the appropriate ‘‘year designation.’’ Take, as an instance, the last emperor of the Yiian dynasty, who reigned from 1333 to 1367; if spoken of personally his title would be Shunti of the Yiian dynasty; but if the year 1334 were

Under the succeeding, the T‘ang dynasty, which ruled from 618 to 906, the manufacture appears to have spread over the greater part of the empire, and to have reached in some places a degree of excellence
_far in advance of that previously attained. The following varieties are
specifically enumerated (in the reverse order of their merit): The Hungchou-yao, a yellow-black porcelain from Hunechow, the g y g , present department of Nan-ch‘ang, in Kiangsi province. The Shou-yao, a yellow porcelain from Shouchou in (present) Kiangsu YQO, 2} g province.
spoken of, it would read ‘‘the second year of (the) Yuan t‘ung (period),’’ and similarly 1336 and 1343 would read ‘‘the second year of (the) Chihytian period)” and “‘the second year of (the) Chihchéng (period).’’ Owing to the fact that dates are thus rendered by the Chinese foreign writers have at times erroneously spoken of the nien-hao, or ‘‘period,”’ as the reign, whereas the miao-hao or ‘‘ temple designation”’ alone corresponds to the Western idea of reign, so far as any time prior to the Ming dynasty is concerned. Uuring the Ming and its successor, the present dynasty, however, each emperor has practically used but one ‘‘yeardesignation”’ throughout the period he has occupied the throne, because though Ying Tsung of the Ming dynasty employed two such designations they were separated by an interregnum of seven years’ duration; and though T‘ai-Tsung-Wen, of the present dynasty, also employed two, he seldom or never comes to the notice of foreign writers. The term ‘‘period’’ being in any case an inconvenient one, and the ‘‘year designation’’ under the Ming and the present dynasty being synchronous with the reign, it seems hypercritical to insist on uniformly translating nien-hao by ‘‘period’’ in the case of emperors of those dynasties, especially as consistency would require that names so well known to every schoolboy, as Kanghsi, Yungchéng, and Chienlung be replaced by the proper titles, Shéng-Tsu-Jén Huangti, Shih-Tsung-Hsien Huangti, and KaoTsung-Shun Huangti. In the following pages, therefore, the nien-hao or ‘‘yvear designation’’ has been rendered ‘‘period”’ prior to the accession of the Ming dynasty in 1368, and subsequently to that date as ‘‘period”’ or ‘‘reign,’’ according to circumstances.
The dates upon porcelain are also usually recorded by the use of the nien-hao, as above described, though other marks are mentioned by Chinese writers, and if the article has been manufactured for the special use of some emperor or prince, it will possibly bear the name of the pavilion or portion of the palace for which it is specially intended. Chinese writers state that the practice of marking the date of manufacture was instituted by the Emperor Chén Tsung of the Sung dynasty, when, on the establishment of the government factory at Chingté-chén, he ordered that each article manufactured should be marked with the nien-hao then used ‘‘Chingté, 1004 to 1007.” Foreign writers on the marks upon porcelain specify other marks of the same dynasty, but upon what authority is not clearly specified. So far as my own knowledge goes, I am unaware of any such date-marks being inscribed under the
glaze prior to the Ming dynasty. Since that time, putting aside monochromes,
which, in probably the majority of instances, bear no mark, they have been employed uninterruptedly, except during a portion of K’anghsi’s reign. In 1677 the magistrate in charge at Chingté-chén forbade the practice alike of inscribing the date and of portraying the actions of celebrated personages, on the ground that if the article were broken, disrespect might be shown to them or to the emperor. During this period, which was of but short duration, however, a leaf, a censer, and other marks replaced the nien-hao.

The Yo-yao, a blue porcelain, according to Julien, but the color was more probably a pale green, for the Ch‘a ching, a Treatise on Tea, written in the eighth century, says cups of this ware gave to the infusion a green tint—from the department of Yochou, in (present) Hunan province.
The Ww-yao and Ting-yao, of colors unspecified, from the department of Wuchou, corresponding with the present department of Chinhua in Chehkiang province; and from the department of Tingchow, corresponding with the present district of Chingyang in the Hsi-an department, Shensi province, respectively.
The Yiich-yao, a blue, or for the same reason as in the case of Yo-yaoa pale-green porcelain, much sought after from the earliest times, from Yiiehchou, corresponding with the present department of Chaohsing in Chehkiang province; and lastly
The Shu-yao or Szechuen porcelain, easily first among the productions of that age, snow-white in color, with a clear ring, thin but strong, and graceful in shape, fram the city of Ta-i, in the department of K‘iungchou, in (present) Szechuen province.
As already stated, M. du Sartel declines to admit the antiquity attributed by M. Julien, on the authority of the native work he translated, to the production of true porcelain in China, namely, the time of the Han dynasty, and somewhere between the years B. C. 185 and A. D. 87. His arguments, however, are marked by strange inaccuracies. Having referred the productions of Hungchou, Shouchou, Yochou, and Yiiehchou, which, as above, Chinese authors claim to have been first manufactured under the T‘ang dynasty, back to the Ch‘in dynasty, that is, to a period nearly two centuries earlier, M. du Sartel argues that the remarks made in the Treatise on Tea above referred to (which, when enumerating the varieties of T‘ang porcelain, classifies them merely according to the suitability of their colored glazes to impart an agreeable tint to tea held in them) tend to show that the bowls or cups in. question could not have been transparent porcelain, bearing a decoration in the colors named under the glaze, but must have been of an opaque substance, covered internally with a thick colored glaze. In this view he considers himself supported by the description given of the Sui dynasty manufactures. This, he argues, gives an idea of transparence, but the transparence is due merely to the use of a more vitreous composition or to a more thorough baking than had been previously customary, and the white color and other distinctive qualities of true porcelain are only to be first found in the productions of the T'ang dynasty—that is, in those productions which M. du Sartel, in disregard of the statements of Chinese writers, the only authorities we have to guide us, himself elects to refer to thisdynasty. Secondly, he

CERAMIC ART IN CHINA. o15
argues that the porcelain manufactured under the Sui and preceding dynasties is uniformly denominated ¢‘ao, that from the latter half of the T‘ang dynasty this word is replaced by the designation yao, which has continued in use up to the present time, and that the change in name coincides with a change in the character of the porcelain manufactured.
The word yao as a designation of porcelain came into general use, it is true, at the beginning of the T*ang dynasty, but that fact would scarcely justify the conclusion that it was designedly introduced in order to mark a synchronous change in the character of the ware, since the same word, which is in any case but a neutral term applicable to any kind of pottery, is met with four centuries earlier to designate some of the products of the Wei dynasty; and besides, in the titles of the chapters in the Provincial Topographies dealing with these manufactures, also in the Treatise on Pottery (the T‘ao shuo, written by Chu Ttung-ch‘uan during the reign of Chien-lung, 1736 to 1795, the authority on this subject), and in the work translated by M. Julien, it is the word ¢*ao, not yao, that is used to designate porcelain. Chinese terminology is but an insecure foundation on which to base arguments, and it might with no less fairness be contended, as the Chinese author translated by M. Julien does contend, that the introduction of the character ¢z‘v%, signifying ** porcelain,” and employed down to the present day to designate the pottery of the Han dynasty, was rendered necessary by the production of an article hitherto unknown, and that this article was true porcelain.
On different grounds from those advanced by M. du Sartel, Doctor Hirth, also, refers the earliest manufacture of true porcelain to the T'ang instead of to the Han dynasty. He says: ** The Chéng-lei-pén-ts‘ao, the pharmacopoia of the Sung dynasty, compiled in 1108, under the head of * Porcelain Earth’ (Kaolin) or Pai-ngo, quotes from the writings of T‘ao Yin-chii that * this substance is now much used for painting pictures,’ and from the Ttang pén-ts‘ao, the pharmacopceia of the T‘ang dynasty, compiled about 650: * This earth is now used for painters’ work, and rarely enters into medical prescriptions; during recent generations it has been used to make white porcelain.” As T*ao Yinchit was a celebrated author on pharmaceutical and other scientific subjects, who died A. D. 536, Doctor Hirth argues that had the pa/-ngo or kaolin been used in his time on an extensive scale in the manufacture of chinaware, so learned a writer would almost certainly have mentioned the subject, and he therefore concludes that porcelain earth for the manufacture of pottery came into use later than 536, and at some time during the T‘ang period, prior to 650, about which date the pharmacopeeia of that dynasty was compiled.
This negative testimony does not, however, dispose of the strong argument in favor of the earlier date, afforded by the coining during the Han dynasty of a new word, ¢z‘i, to designate the productions of that age,

<<<Page: 497>>>

a word which, as already stated, is still in ordinary use to designate porcelain. On this point Doctor Hirth thinks he has detected that the word ¢z‘% has had different significations at different epochs, for while in the Shuo-wén, a glossary published A. D. 100, ¢z‘d is defined as ‘‘earthenware,” it is defined in the dictionaries of the Sung period— nine centuries later—as ‘* hard, fine-grained pottery; ” and calling attention to the fact that there are now two forms of this character in use, the original form with the radical denoting *‘ brick or earthen material,” and a later form with the radical ‘‘ stone,” he thinks that ‘‘ this substitution by later generations for the original sign of a character of the same sound, but with a radical more appropriate to the category of the word — as it was at the time understood, may be regarded as indicating a change from the original meaning.”' Even if this be true, no data are thereby afforded to help fix even the approximate date of change in the method of manufacture. For after the change in the system of manufacture had taken place, a considerable period would almost certainly elapse before an author of sufficient literary importance to impose a new style of writing on the nation would learn sufficient regarding the altered ingredients employed to have the corresponding modification in the descriptive word suggested to his mind, and a still longer period would elapse before this newly coined word would pass into current use.
The authors translated by M. Julien, too, state distinctly that the introduction of the later form—that with the radical ‘* stone ”—and the continued use of it are due to ignorance and error. At Tz‘t-chou, a district anciently within the department of Changté, in Honan proyince, but now belonging to the department of Kuangp‘ing, in Chibli province, a kind of porcelain was made during the Sung dynasty which enjoyed a very high reputation, the plain white specimens bringing even higher prices than the celebrated productions of Tingchow, which it closely resembled. This ware was known as 72‘% ware, or porcelain from Tz‘u-chow, and thus this form of the character, which was originally a local designation, not an intentional modification of the older form introduced to typify a modification in the system of manufacture, passed into general use to designate not merely this special class, but (erroneously) all porcelain.”
It is a curious coincidence that no less diversity of opinion has existed regarding the date at which the western equivalent of this word ¢z‘i, the term ‘‘ porcelain,” was introduced and the article it has at different

*S. Julien, L’ Histoire et la Fabrication de la Porcelaine Chinoise, p. 29: This is, I think, probably the true explanation of the change of form; for the only correct way of writing this character recognized at the present time by the Imperial Academy is the original form, with the radical ‘‘earthenware,’’ not that with the radical ‘‘stone,”’

times been used to designate. Pére d’Entrecolles affirms that the name porcelain was first given by the Portuguese to the Chinese vases imported by them into Europe in 1518, but further researches into the history of the word by M. Brongniart and M. de Laborde show that the name arose from a supposed resemblance in appearance of surface between the transparent pottery of the East and certain shells ~which had been previously so designated. M. de Laborde says:
Les anciens ayant trouvé ou cherché une ressemblance entre ce qwils appelaient porea et certaines coquilles, donnérent 4 celles-la le nom de porcella. Le moyen Age accepta cette analogie en appelant porcelaine une famille entiére de coquilles, et aussi les ouvrages qui étaient faits de nacre de perle, et, par métonymie, la nacre seule tirée de la coquille.
A partir du XIV° siécle, les gardes des joyaux décriyvent en grand nombre dans les inventaires, et les experts mentionnent et estiment dans leurs rapports, des vases, des ustensiles de table, des tableaux de dévotion, et des joyaux faits de la porcelaine. Cette expression «i travers quelques variantes sans importance, reste la méme et s’applique aux mémes choses jusqu’au XVI° siécle; de ce moment elle se bifurque pour conserver d’une part sa vieille signification, et s’étendre de l’autre 4 des vases et ustensiles d’importation étrangére qui offraient la méme blancheur nacrée. C’était la poterie émaillée de la Chine qui s’emparait de ce nom auquel elle n’avait droit que par une analogie de teinte et de grain.
“M. du Sartel is strongly of opinion that the word porcelain was used in its present sense far earlier than the date assigned by M. de Laborde, and in support of his view quotes the mention of ‘* pourcelaine” in royal inventories dating from 1360 to 1416 for France, and from the beginning of the sixteenth century for the Roman Empire. These documents appear to me, however, rather to support M. de Laborde’s views; for the details given in the French inventories of representations on the articles named, of our Lord, the Blessed Mother, and of Saints, and of their decoration with jewels,’ would seem to make the possibility of their being oriental porcelain more than doubtful; while the inventories belonging to the Roman Empire—that is, from the date M. de Laborde says the word was applied to oriental pottery, do mention articles undoubtedly of real porcelain, all, with one exception, in monochrome.
A statement quoted by M. du Sartel from Pierre Bélon, of 1553, is worth reproducing, as evidence that in the latter half of the sixteenth century the word porcelain was still applied to shells, to mother-of-pearl, to oriental pottery, and even to Italian faience. He says:
Des yaisseaux de porcelaine, qu’il a yvus vendre en public au Caire, lesquels vases de porcelaine sont transparents et coustent bien cher au Caire et ilz disent mesmement qu’ilz les apportent des Indes, mais cela ne me sembla vraysemblable; car on
With regard to the last mentioned, it should be stated that in the magnificent Dresden collection, formed chiefly by Augustus the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, between 1694 and 1705, there is a small ivory-white plate with uncut rubies and emeralds in gold filigree let into the paste, with the character fu, happiness, on the foot in blue under the glaze, which is said to have been brought by a crusader from Palestine in the twelfth century.

To the T’ang succeeded the epoeh of the five dynasties, all of them short-lived and naming themselves successors to some one of the more important dynasties thac had preceded them.
Under one of these, the Posterior Chou, during the reign of the Emperor Shih-tsung (954 to 959), a celebrated porcelain, far superior to any yet produced, was manufactured in the district of Pien, the present department of K’aiféng, in Honan province. It is described as being sky-blue in color, of brilliant surface, thin as paper, and giving out a clear musical sound when struck, the only defect being that the base was apt to be disfigured by the remains of the coarse sand on which the vessel had rested in the furnace, and which had become attached to it during the process of baking. The color was adopted in obedience to an imperial order that porcelain intended for palace use should thenceforward be ‘‘as blue as the clear sky after rain.” This porcelain, which was consequently termed Yii-yao, ‘‘ Imperial porcelain,” and, after the accession of the succeeding dynasty, Ch‘az-yao, ‘‘Ch‘ai porcelain” (Ch‘ai being the Emperor’s family name), was very highly prized, and becoming in subsequent years, owing to its delicate make, exceedingly rare, the smallest fragments were treasured as cap ornaments or. necklace pendants. Porcelain, blue in color and with the characters ‘‘ blue as the clear sky after rain” stamped in the glaze, is at the present time to be obtained in China. It is scarcely necessary to state, however, that such specimens do not date from the time of Shih-tsung; on the contrary, they are of quite modern manufacture. Already in the sixteenth cen-

tury Hsiang Tzu-ching writes in the preface to his catalogue, ‘‘ In the present day men search for a fragment of this porcelain without being able to find one, and declare it to be but a phantom.” ’
In truth, the description which has been attempted of the varieties of porcelain hitherto enumerated possesses merely a historical interest. No specimens manufactured prior to the advent of the Sung dynasty have survived to the present day, and even of the Sung productions the finer kinds have entirely disappeared. Suchspecimensas have weathered the storms and dangers of the subsequent eight centuries are, so faras IT amaware, only céladons of considerable solidity—chiefly Lungch‘iian or Chiinchow ware—or small pieces of no great fineness. Three centuries ago even the finest varieties were already scarce, as is evident from a passage in the P*/ng hua-p‘u, an essay on flower-pots and flowers in pots, from the pen of Chang Ch‘ien-té, an author who wrote near the close of the Ming dynasty, that is, about the beginning of the seventeenth century:
In ancient times no vases were made of porcelain, and up to the T‘ang dynasty all such vessels were of copper. It was not till then that pottery came into vogue. After this period we find a large number of classes of porcelain, such as the kinds known as Ch‘ai (that described above), Ju, Kuan, Ko, Ting, Lungch‘iian, Chiinchou, Changshéng, Wuni (all of the Sung dynasty period), Hsiitanté, and Ch’énghua (of the Ming dynasty). Among antiquities, copper articles are the best; of porcelain, the Ch‘ai and Ju kinds, though the best of all, have ceased to exist; Kuan, Ko, Hstian, and Ting porcelains are the most precious curiosities of the present day; whereas the porcelains called Lungch‘iian (the heavy old céladons of modern collectors), Chiinchou, Changshéng, Wunié, and Ch’enghua are esteemed as objects of only secondary value.’ ?
As Chang Ch‘ien-té further says that he constantly met with specimens of Juchou porcelain, and since vases of that ware are figured in Hsiang Tzti-ching’s catalogue, it would appear that this highly esteemed porcelain must have disappeared from the market towards the close of the sixteenth century. It is curious, too, that while Chang Ch‘ien-té places the productions of the Ch’énghua period (1465 to 1487) at the foot of the list of porcelains of ‘* only secondary value,” the prices paid for this ware within a century of its production were very high. In Hsiang Tzit-ching’s catalogue the price paid for a tazza-shaped cup is stated to have been 60 taels (or $90 gold); and of two miniature Wine cups he says, *‘ these are choice specimens of the wine cups of this celebrated reign, and are valued at 100 taels ($150 gold) the pair, yet now even for this money it is impossible to get them.” *

The porcelain manufactured under this dynasty appears to have far excelled in quality and delicacy of workmanship all that preceded it, the Ch‘ai-yao alone perhaps excepted. The shapes and primp decorations appear to have been modeled, as a rule, after ancient bronzes, figured in illustrated catalogues of the most celebrated — specimens of such vessels (as the Po-ku-t‘u), published during the Hsiian-ho period, 1119 to 1125, and the K‘ao-ku-t‘u; and when not modeled after such ancient designs, the vessel took the form of some natural object, asa tree or flower or of some animal, real or imaginary. In the former the pattern was engraved with a pointed style in the paste, and was broken here and there by lions’ or dragons’ heads in bold relief, with an elaboration and wealth of ornament hitherto undreamed of. That.a remarkable degree of proficiency had by this time been obtained in the ceramic art is evident from the descriptions preserved by Hsiang Tzit-ching of some specimens of Tingchou ware seen by him.
(1) A sacrificial jar in the form of an elephant from an ancient bronze design. The body forms the wine vessel, the uplifted trunk the spout, a narrow canopy arching over the saddle the handle, to which is attached a round cover ornamented with geometrical and spiral scroll borders surmounted by a knot. The rope girths and ornamental details engraved under a white glaze.
(2) A branched pricket candlestick—a slender pillar on a solid foliated stand curves at the top to end in a phoenix head, from the back of which hangs a ring chain, ~ which suspends the stem of a lotus, branching into three flowers to hold the candles, which are shaded by a huge overhanging leaf. Ornamented with engraving under a pure white glaze.
(3) A jar which was of irregular quadrangular section, carved in relief after an ancient bronze design, with lobes on the body, a scroll border below, and a band of ornament in the form of coiled dragons round the neck. Loop handles terminating in horned heads and with rings hanging from them project from the neck. Covered with glaze the color of ripe grapes, transparent and of a perfect luster—a beautiful vase to hold flowers for the table."
Prior to the Sung dynasty the external color of all porcelain appears to have been solely determined by that of the glaze, and to have been almost entirely monochrome. In a few instances vases were covered with parti-colored glazes, which were apt to flow into one another in the heat of the kiln,and so gave rise to the fortuitous productions known as Yao-pien (the French Jlambes), articles the decoration of which ‘‘changed during the process of baking.” The Sung porcelain was essentially, I believe, of the same character, the coloring of the article produced being dctemnied only by the vad of glaze which was spread over the paste or biscuit.

With the sole exception of the Nanféng ware, and a portion of that from Linch’uan, produced during the Yiian dynasty, none of which seems to have survived to the present day, but which is described as having been decorated with flowers coarsely painted under the glaze, lcan find nothing in the works of Chinese writers on this subject to justify the concession of a greater antiquity than the early part of the Ming dynasty—that is, the first half of the fifteenth century—to the ornamentation of vases with arabesques and scroll work, with landseapes, historical scenes, or genre paintings in several colors.
This conclusion, if correct, is a point of considerable importance as an aid in determining the true age of specimens which are at times credited with an origin far remote. It is true that céladon vases, into the ornamentation of which leaves enter, are sometimes described as having the leaves veined with dark green, but these deeper shades may result from the fact that the ornamentation has been engraved in the paste, and that the coloring matter has sunk into the line of engraving, thereby producing a darker shade along the lower levels. Other specimens of céladon ware had one or sometimes two bands of ornamentation of a deeper green than the body cf the vase. This deeper tone might, however, have been produced by a double layer of glaze; in any case the peculiarity would not amount to ornamentation in several colors in the sense in which I use that expression. Again, the single specimen of black Tingchou porcelain illustrated (and indeed ever seen) by Hsiang Tzii-ching is described as ‘‘a duck-headed vase, bottle shape, with swelling body and ringed neck, which curves over to end in a duck’s head, a round orifice with a small cover being on the convexity of the curve. The black color is painted on the head and neck, gradually fading away on the body of the vase, which is enamelled white.” ! This description conveys the idea that the head and neck of the duck were covered with black glaze, the body of the vase with white glaze, and that in the baking the former spread downwards and ‘gradually merged into the white of the body. It in no way invalidates the conclusion above suggested.
It will be advisable to examine in greater detail the several varieties of porcelain manufactured under this dynasty, following the order of merit usually ascribed to them by Chinese writers.
JSu-yao or Juchou porcelain.—Chinese authors state that the porcelain manufactured at Tingchow (see p. 324), being unfit for presentation to the Emperor, the establishment of a factory for the manufacture of more suitable articles was ordered at Juchow, in Honan Province.According to some writers the defect of the Tingchou ware was its

gritty character; according to others, the frequency of cracks caused _ .
by too rapid or careless baking. As, however, they agree in ascribing the introduction of /Ju-yao and its success to the early part of the Sung dynasty—that is, to the very time from which date the finest specimens of the Tingchou porcelain—it is difficult not to conclude that native authors, writing centuries later, have ascribed the establishment of this factory to erroneous causes.
The finest specimens, which were very thin and delicate, were superior to imperial ware (Awan-yao), and were of either plain or crackled * surface, with the ornamentation engraved under the paste. The craquelure, though coarse in inferior specimens, must in the better grades have been very close and fine, as it is described as resembling fishroe. But that not crackled was the most highly esteemed. Hsiang Tzi’-ching, describing a beaker of old bronze design with engraved decoration under a bluish-green color not crackled, speaks of it as ‘‘a rare kind of Juchou ware.” In color it was céladon. In one place this porcelain is described, it is true, as being like the sky after rain, but as elsewhere it is stated to have resembled the Ao-yao, or
‘Crackling (craquelure) was originally considered in Europe a defect of baking, which resulted from a lack of homogeneity between paste and glaze, causing one to contract more rapidly than did the other. It was not till a comparatively recent date that the actual facts came to be appreciated, namely, that in the eyes of the Chinese the craquelure is a species of decoration, and that they have a special kind of enamel, into the composition of which steatite enters largely, the sole object of which is to produce this curious appearance. By means of this enamel they can at will cover the surface of a vase with any one of a variety of craquelure, either large ‘like cracks in ice,’’ or small as ‘‘the fish roe,’’ ‘‘the dodder,”’ or ‘‘the crabs’ claws.’’ In some specimens bands are found crackled separating other bands not crackled; or colors, usually either black or red, are rubbed into the crackling to render it more apparent, or to impart a tinge to the entire surface. In other specimens again, though for what reason is not known, the paste, after having been decorated, is covered with a crackled glaze, and a second decoration, haying no apparent connection with that beneath, is painted above the glaze. The colers of the Juchou, government (Kuan), Ko, Lungeh‘iian and Chiinchou porcelains were all some shade of what the Chinese call ch‘ing. Now ch‘ing means in some combinations blue, in others a pale dull green, as of the fresh olive, which is called by the Chinese ch‘ing-kuo, the ch‘ing-colored fruit. Pére d’Entrecolles, when writing of the Lungch‘iian ware, describes its color correctly as teinte d’olive. M. Julien, however, in spite of a hint given from the technical annotator M. Salvetat, which might have set him right, rejected this sense on what seemed to him sufficient grounds, and insisted on (erroneously ) translating this word throughout his work as “‘blue,’’ though by so doing he had to make his porcelain ‘‘as blue as jade’’—with the result that subsequent writers on this subject have failed to derive any assistance from his work in determining the origin and history of céladon porcelain. Hirth, Ancient Chinese Porcelain, p. 7.
Céladon was originally the name of the hero in the popular novel /’ Astrée, written by Honoré d’ Urfé in the seventeenth century. Céladon was attired in clothes of a kind of sea-green hue with gray or bluish tint, and his name thus came to be applied to the clothes he wore, precisely that designated by the Chinese as ch ‘ing. :

erackled céladons in color, though somewhat darker in shade, there seems no reason to doubt that its real tint was bluish-green—that is, céladon—especially as the specimens of this ware illustrated in the ecatlogue translated by Doctor Bushell are so painted. Hsiang Tzii‘ching, the author of this catalogue, after describing a vase 64 inches high, which is stated to have cost 150,000 cash, or about $150 gold, says, ‘‘ Specimens of Juchou ware are very rare, and, when met with, are usually plates and bowls. A perfect unbroken vase like this is almost unique, and as it excels Kuan and Ko porcelain both in form and glaze, it is far more valuable.” Within three or four decades later, as has already been stated, it seems to have been impossible to find any specimens at all of this ware.
Kuan-yao—that is, official or Government porcelain—was the produce of the imperial factories established under the Sung dynasty between the years 1107 and 1117 at Pienliang, the present department of K‘aiféng, in Honan province, and after the removal southwards of the court before the advancing Mongols, at the southern capital, Hangchou, in Chehkiang province. During the Takuan period (1107 to 1110) the shades specially affected were, first, pale white like the moon, the French clair de lune; second, pale bluish-green; and third, dark green; but during the Chingho period (1111 to 1117) the only color employed was bluish-green, both dark and pale in tint. This porcelain was very thin, and in some cases crackled all over so finely as to resemble crab’s claws, with the red brim and iron-colored foot distinctive of the true eéladon. The Po-wu-yao-lan, quoted in the Z”ao0-shuo’ Treatise on Pottery (chap. 2, p. 9), explains this latter expression as follows:
As regards Kuan-yao, it should be known that the porcelain earth found at the foot of the Fénghuang-shan, or Phoenix hill, near Hangchou, is red; for this reason the foot (the base on which the vessel rests when being fired, and which is therefore not covered by the enamel), resembles iron in color. This was ‘at the time called ‘redmouthed and iron-footed.’? The term ‘‘red mouth”’ refers to the brim or opening of the vessel, which becomes red by the enamel flowing down and away from it, so as to be much thinner on the brim than it is on the body of the vessel, thus allowing spots of red paste to become visible.
Doctor Hirth, after quoting this explanation, adds:
The red or iron colored bottom, usually appearing in the shape of a ring, is a characteristic feature of the Lungch‘iian céladons; but if the above explanation is correct, the bottom of Lungch‘iian vessels differed from Kuan-yao bottoms, since the paste of Hangchou céladons (the southern Kuan-yao) is said to be red in itself, whereas that of the Lungch‘iian-yao is originally white, and merely turns red in such parts of the surface as are not covered by the enamel.?

From Hsiang Tzti-ching’s catalogue it would seem as if there were originally two recognized classes of this ware—ordinary Awan-yao and Ta-kuan, ov superior Auan-yao. Among the latter he mentions an ink slab for the Emperor’s use, in which ‘‘an oval was left unglazed in the center for rubbing the ink on, showing the red paste.” Both were céladon in color; in the superior variety (¢a-hwan), however, the glaze appears to have been more brilliant—it is described as ‘* clear and lustrous, like an emerald in tint.” The two specimens of this ware described were both coarsely crackled. The ordinary Awan-yao was in some cases crackled with a glaze varying from pale green to deep onion; in other specimens uncrackled, the latter being seemingly of a lighter tint than the crackled; the ornamentation, consisting of a variety of scroll designs or of some geometrical patterns broken by animals’ heads in relief, was engraved under the glaze.’
After the court had been removed south to Hangchou, Shao Ch‘éngchang, superintendent of the Northern Imperial Park, is said to have established a factory in the residence of the junior director of the palace. Made of very pure clay, with great grace of form and covered with a transparent, brilliant glaze, this porcelain, which was termed Nei-yao porcelain of the palace or Auwan-yao—Government porcelain— gained a high reputation.
Ting-yao, or porcelain of Tingchow, was manufactured originally in the district of that name in Chihli province, near the present department of Chéngting. It was known as Pei-ting or Northern Ting (960-1126), in contradistinction to the Van-ting or Southern Ting, produced at Hangchow after the retreat of the court southward before the advancing Mongols in 1127. The former was the more highly prized, and the finest specimens of this ware were those produced, it is said, during the period Chéngho (1111 to 1117) and Hsiianho (1119 to 1125). Incolor they were brilliant white, purple, or black; and though the Ao-ku-yao-lan (a work treating of antiquities, completed in 1387), as quoted in the 7*ao-shuo, or Treatise on Porcelain, from which the authors translated by M. Julien derive most of their information regarding the ceramics of earlier dynasties, gives as the test of Tingchow porcelain **the purity of its white color and brillancy of its glaze,” it is evident that the connoisseur Hsiang Tzt-ching experienced a stronger affection for his ‘* beautiful purple glaze, uniformly brilliant and transparent, resembling the tint of ripe grapes or of the aubergine (eggplant)” and his black, than he did for the white glaze, though it were, in his own words, ‘* uniformly lustrous and translucent,.like mutton-fat or fine jade.” Both the purple and black varieties were far rarer than
1S. W. Bushell, Chinese Porcelain before the Present Dynasty, Nos. 2, 5, 8, 13, 15, 17, 47, 50, 53, 73.

the white. ‘Ihave seen,” says the collector, ** hundreds of specimens of the white, scores of purple-brown, but the black is extremely rare, and I have only seen the one specimen I have described in my whole life” —and he then had in his possession at least one of the specimens more than fifty years. It is, I think, in this rarity of the purple and black glazes that the explanation of the dictum above quoted is to be found, and probably they were unknown to its authors. The varieties mentioned in the Ao-ku-yao-lan as inferior to the white do not include these colors, and seem to result from impure clay or defective glaze.
The same work (the Ao-hu-yao-lan) says that one of the signs of the genuineness of this ware was the presence of marks on it like tears. This probably means granulations, for it is explained that these marks were caused by the manner in which the enamel was thrown upon the white paste. Specimens having ornamental designs engraved in the paste were the best, though the plain or unornamented were also highly esteemed; the second class consisted of such as had the ornamentation worked into the enamel, and a third of such as had the decoration printed or pressed upon them with a mold, the ornaments chiefly used being the Chinese peony or Pwonia moutan, the hsiian-ts*ao or Hemerocallis fulva, and the flying fenghuang (Phenix). In Hsiang Tzt-ching’s catalogue, however, eleven specimens, all undoubtedly of the finest quality—six of the white glaze, four of the purple, and one of the black—are described, into the ornamentation of no one of which enters either of these so-called ** usual” patterns; the decoration in every case is in general character exactly similar to that found on the Juchow ware already described.
Tingchow ware was well imitated during the Yiian dynasty (1260 to 1367) by one P*éng Chiin-pao at Hochow, in Kiangnan province, and later on very successfully at Chingté-chen.* His productions, known as P*éng porcelain, after himself, and Ho porcelain, from the locality, are described as ‘‘ fine in paste and white in color, looking very much like real 7ing-yao.”
Lungch‘iian-yao (Lungeh‘iian porcelain) was manufactured from the early part of the Sung dynasty (end of tenth or beginning of eleventh century) in the district of that name, situated in the department of Ch‘iichow, Chehkiang province. The ornamentation was engraved under the glaze, which was of various shades from the color of ¢rass to deep onion-green, sometimes crackled and sometimes not crackled; and occasionally bands of foliate or scroll pattern are found of deeper tone than the rest of the vessel. The biscuit, which was of fine clay, turned brown when the absence of glaze had exposed it to the effect of heat

<<<Page: 507>>>

during baking, though when covered by the glaze and in fractures it remained white, and on the base or foot was a ferruginous ring. The specimens which survive are mostly coarse and thick, but as the best examples were considered but little inferior to Awan-yao, these probably represent only the rougher and inferior grades. In the designs no little artistic merit is shown at times. One specimen which is described by Hsiang Tzii-ching (and I have myself seen one exactly similar) consists of a whorl of palm leaves surrounding a hollow stem to hold flowers. Another is ‘‘a sacrificial urn moulded in the form of a hornless rhinoceros, the body hollowed out to hold wine, with a peaked saddle on the back as cover, after a bronze design from the Po-ku-t'u encyclopedia.” The author translated by M. Julien says that this ware was subsequently successfully imitated at Chingté-chén, and that the latter surpassed the originals in beauty. Doctor Hirth, however, avers on the authority of native connoisseurs that the pure Lungch‘iian products can be distinguished from all imitaticas; first, because it is a peculiarity of the clay used in the manufacture of the former alone to turn brown or red on the surface when left exposed during baking, while the biscuit remains white where covered; and, secondly, because, owing to this peculiarity of the clay, the ferruginous ring on articles of white porcelain manufactured elsewhere can only be produced by artificially coloring the foot or base; an act which, of course, admits of ready detection on the part of an experienced collector.*
Subsequently, after the removal of the court southward in 1127, according to an authority quoted in the Topography of the Chehkiang province, the brothers Chang, natives of Ch‘iichow, but having their factory in the Lungceh‘iian district, gained a high reputation for their porcelain. These brothers are known as Shéng-i, the elder-born, and Shéng-érh, the second-born. The produce of the former’s kiln was called Ao-yao, or elder-brother’s porcelain, to distinguish it from that _ manufactured by the younger Chang, which was termed Chang-yao or Chang Lungch“ian yao, i. e., Lungech‘iian porcelain made by Chang (the younger). Both are céladon in color, though the elder brother’s ware appears to have been lighter in tint, and both have the distinctive marks of céladon, the red mouth or opening and ferruginous ring on the foot. The main difference between the two seems to have been that the Ao-yao was crackled—so closely in the best specimens as to resemble the fishroe—whereas the Chang-yao was uncrackled. In other respects the descriptions are curiously conflicting. The history of the Chingtéchén factory says that Ao-yao was extremely thin, while the Wu-ts‘aisu, a work of the Ming dynasty, speaks of it as the one kind of por-

celain of this epoch ** of which it is not too difficult to obtain specimens, owing to its peculiar heaviness, which enables it to last long.” As compared with the more ancient porcelain of Lungch‘iian, the productions of the two Chang are described as ‘‘smaller, more graceful in shape, and showing greater delicacy of workmanship.” *
The Chiin-yao was a porcelain made from the early part of the Sung dynasty, in the district of Chiinchow or sometimes wrongly corresponding to the present district of Yii-chow, in the department of K‘aiféng, Honan province. It was sometimes molded in grotesque forms (as a lamp formed of a hornless dragon with scaly body and four short legs, the serpent-like head protruding with mouth open to receive the wick and body hollowed into a receptacle for oil), but was usually modeled after ancient bronzes and ornamented with scroll or floral patterns under the glaze, which, according to Hsiang Tzt-ching, was either vermilionred or aubergine purple—the two most valuable colors—moonlight white (c/azr de lune) or pale green, and sometimes marked with granulations. The authorities quoted in the 7*ao-shwo, or Treatise on Pottery, would lead one to believe that the best pieces had two or more colors of glaze on the same vase. The higher quality, according to them, consisted of pieces having a color red like cinnabar and green like onion leaves and kingfisher’s feathers, which is commonly called parrot-green, and aubergine purple, or of pieces red like rouge, green like onion leaves and kingfisher’s feathers, and purple like ink; these three colors being intact and unchanged by baking. M. Julien enumerates seven varieties: (1) green or blue like plums; (2) purple-brown like the aubergine; (3) red like the Pyrus japonica; (4) pig’s liver; (5) mule’s lungs; (6) mucus; (7) sky-blue. But such differentiation appears erroneous, for the Treatise on Pottery says:
Pieces that have one or two numbers on the bottom as a trade-mark, and are of a color resembling pig’s liver—since the red, ch‘ing (céladon), and green colors got mixed together like saliva hanging down through not being sufficiently fired—are not to be distinguished as different kinds; for such names as mucus or pig’s liver, which are given to this class of porcelain, have been invented for fun’ssake. Among these porcelains those which have bottoms like the flower pots in which sword grass is grown are considered the most excellent; the others, namely, those which have ton-shaped censers, Ho-fang jugs, or Kuan-tzii, are all of a yellowish sandy paste, for which reason they are not good in appearance.’

* The translation followed is Doctor Hirth’s, but the sense is better brought out by Doctor Busheli’s more correct rendering, which runs thus: ‘‘Among these porcelains the flower pots and saucers for growing sword grass are the most beautiful; the others, namely, the barrel seats, censers and boxes, square vases and jars with covers,’ ete. (North China Herald, 12th May, 1888.) The words here rendered, ‘‘the flower

The same authority adds that none of these porcelains lasted long. Specimens are, however, I believe, still to be found. Hsiang Tziching, after describing a small jar, of globular form, with two boldly designed phcenixes molded in high relief as handles, interrupting a border of spirally ornamented medallions, adds:
Chiinchow porcelain is put at the bottom of the Sung potteries, yet a jar like this one, of elegant form, good color, and fine engraved work, equals, if not excels, as a
flower vase, one of Ju, Kuan, Ko, or Ting pottery. It is marked beneath with the — numeral wu, five, an additional proof that it is really a Chin piece.!
Tung-ch*ing-yao, or céladon porcelain, from the eastern capital, was produced at factories situated in the department of K‘aiféng, Honan province, the so-called eastern capital of the Sung monarchs, before their retreat southward, from 960 to 1126. It was of various shades of céladon, uncrackled (seemingly), with the ornamentation engraved under the glaze. The description given by Hsiang Tzti-ching of a small vessel of this ware will convey a truer idea of its character than the vague disquisition of the encyclopzedists.
‘It is of hexagonal form, with lobed border, decorated in panels, with formal sprays ef flowers, plum blossoms, polyporus fungus, and grass, chrysanthemum, bamboo, etc., carved in relief undera glaze of bright green color like jade, raised in faint millet-like tubercles.” ”
in addition to the above celebrated productions of the Sung dynasty, the following less remarkable varieties may be mentioned: : The //siao-yao, from the Hsiao district, in the department of Hsiichou, Kiangnan province, extremely thin and brilliant, white in color,
and very elegant in shape and workmanship. The Chichow-yao, from the district of that name, corresponding with the present Luling district, in the department of Chi-an, Kiangnan province; both white and violet, the latter closely resembling the
pots and saucers for growing sword grass,’’ are translated by M. Julien ‘‘les plats sous le pied desquels on a peint un glaieul.’’? This misconception of the meaning has, as Doctor Hirth points out, led astray all later writers on porcelain and its marks, who have thus been led by Julien into describing the acorus as a mark, when found on the foot of a vessel of its being a Kiun (Chiin) piece of the finest quality. Doctor Hirth also draws attention to the fact that the expression t‘u-ssii-wén, translated by Julien when treating of one class of this porcelain as showing ‘‘veines imitant les soies (poils) du liévre,’’ really means showing veining like the cuscuta or dodder— t‘u-sst being the name of that plant.

violet porcelain of Tingchow. The best was made by the family Shu; that produced by the daughter, Shu Chiao, realizing almost as much as Ao-yao (the elder Chang’s porcelain). Her large vases for holding flowers would fetch several ounces of silvereach. Regarding the violet variety, the technical annotator of M. Julien’s work adds the following note: ** I] est probable que ces porcelaines violettes étaient fabriquées a état de biscuit, et colorées ensuite avec un émail plombeux coloré par le manganése. Cette considération reporterait 4 Pannée 960 de notre ére les glacures plombiféres; ce nest qu’en 1283 quw’un potier de Schlestadt trouva le procédé de vernir la poterie au moyen du plomb, et put créer une fabrication véritablement industrielle.”
The Zsiuchow-yao and Ssuchow-yao, from the districts respectively of the same name in the Kiangnan province. They resembled the (white?) Tingchow porcelain, but were far inferior in quality.
The T*ang-yi-yao and Téngchow-yao, manufactured in the T‘ang and Téngchow districts of the department of Nayang, Honan province— both céladon, but, like the next, inferior to Juchow ware.
The Yaochow-yao, from the district of that name in the department of Hsi-an, Shansi province. They were originally céladon, but vases of white porcelain, possessed of considerable merit, though lacking in grace and strength, were subsequently produced.
The Wyunz-yao, from the department of Chienning, Fukien province—a céladon made from black coarse clay, lacking in polish and with dry looking glaze.
The Chien-yao, from the department of Chienchow, the present district of Chienyang, in the department of Chienning, Fukier. province— thin, of pale black color and of high polish, it was highly esteemed; some specimens were studded with granulations resembling drops or yellow pearls.
The Yiihang-yao, from the Yithang district, in the department of Hangchow, Chehkiang province—a kind of céladon, resembling Kuan-yao, but inferior, possessing neither the same crackle nor brillianey.
The Lishui-yao, from Lishui district, in the department of Ch‘iichow, Chehkiang province—heavy and thick, resembling in color the Lungch‘iian (that is, céladon) ware, but far inferior to it.!
Under the Mongol dynasty, the Yiian (1260 to 1349), the manufac ture of porcelain generally appears to have retrograded. Exceptions, however, must at least be made in favor of that produced for the special use of the Emperor. This ware—to judge from the specimens

described by Hsiang Tziit-ching—was white in color, with the ornamentation faintly engraved in the paste. Plates, bowls, etc., are said to have borne the characters shu-fu, ‘‘the palace,” inscribed on the interior on the foot. Hsiang Tzt-ching' says that this shw-fw porcelain was copied from the Tingchow ware of the Northern Sung dynasty,.and the vase in his own collection he considers altogether like a Ting piece in its form, in the color of the paste, and in the engraved design.
The details given by native writers regarding the productions of this period are scanty in the extreme. They mention, however, that at Lungch‘iian céladons were produced on the model of the Chang ware, but the clay used was coarse and dry, and failed to give the fine color which had characterized the older productions.
At Ho-chow, in the Kiangnan province, P‘éng Chiin-pao produced, as already stated, some excellent porcelain, known as New Zing-yao and from the name of the district in which it was produced, //o-yao or ware of Ho, and closely resembling the older ware from Tingchow. Made from fine, white, plastic clay, it was very thin and céladon in color. Other varieties mentioned are:
The Hsiianchow-yao, from the department of that name in Kiangnan province, very thin and white in color.
The Linch‘uan-yao, from the district of that name in the department of Fuchow, Kiangsi province, was a porcelain made from soft white clay. It was thin, and generally white, with a light yellow tinge; but some bore flowers coarsely painted.
The WVanféng-yao, from the district of that name in the department of Chienchang, Kiangsi province, was a somewhat thick porcelain, in many cases ornamented with flowers in blue. These two latter kinds appear to have been very famous under the Yiian dynasty, and to have been much preferred to the productions of Chingtéchén.
The Hut‘ien-yao, manufactured in the neighborhood of Chingté-chén, was either a yellowish-black, or, if white, had a tint of that color.’
No specimens of these wares have, however, so far as I am aware, survived to the present day, and among those which Chinese connoisseurs now declare to be red products of the Yiian dynasty one seldom sees any but such as are of a uniform whitish purple with deep red splashes.
Under the Ming dynasty the ceramic art made great progress, both in the fineness of the ware and in the excellence of the decorative workmanship. It would appear that under the Yiian dynasty imperial’

orders were not invariably executed at the government factories, but were frequently intrusted to private enterprise. None, however, of the articles tendered was-accepted unless considered perfect, and the test was so severe that as much as 90 per cent was at times rejected. Under the Ming dynasty, however, the manufacture appears to have been more and more restricted to the Chingté-chén factories, which thenceforward practically monopolized the production of artistic porcelain. The administration was reformed, and officers were dispatched from the capital with the orders, the execution of which they had to superintend, and on completion to deliver to the palace—duties which, like most others of emolument and dignity, were absorbed by eunuchs during the reigns of the last emperors of that dynasty.
In their paintings, which are always in water color, the Chinese, while of course requiring on the artist’s part a knowledge of the technique adequate to a proper treatment of the subject chosen, admire chiefly a boldness of stroke which proves complete mastery over the pencil, and a facility of conception which permits of improvisation, so to speak; that is, of the elaboration of the original design currente calamo, and without having previously outlined a sketch of it upon the object to be decorated. This style of painting is termed p7-7, ‘* following the will of the brush.” An artist who first sketches out his design and then carefully and elaborately fills in the details, a style which is depreciatingly termed /wng-z, ‘* mechanical,” occupies in their estimation a very subordinate position. And the characteristics of the two styles are so clearly defined, or at least are so patent to the practiced native eye, that a single glance almost suffices to enable a connoisseur to determine to which of the two a painting belongs.
In a country, too, where painting as a profession does not exist, and where the interchange of fans or scrolls painted by the donors, as one of the most ordinary forms of courtesy, generates, if not a profound knowledge of the art, at least a very general practical proficiency in it, it has resulted that the most noted artists are to be found among the class enjoying the most leisure—that formed of the successful competitors in the literary examinations which constitute the one entry to official employment. In this way the more highly esteemed style of painting, with its bold free stroke, came to be considered (as indeed it practically was) the almost exclusive production of the literary or official class. Hence when, during the Ch‘énghua period, the decoration of porcelain in many colors came to be that most highly prized, it became customary to have the designs drawn by the most celebrated artists among the palace officials and to transmit them to the manufactory to be there executed by the most skilled painters.
Owing to the care thus exercised in obtaining decorative designs from the brushes of the best artists and in having them executed by the most able workmen, the manufacture reached a higher point of excellence

during this (the Ch‘énghua) period than at any other time during the Ming dynasty, and the steps of development which led to this result may be distinctly traced.
As has been remarked earlier, decoration by painting in colors as distinct from the general coloring imparted by glaze was, I believe, first reached under the Ming dynasty. Inthe Yunglo period (1403 to 1424) it took the form of decoration in blue under the glaze. Special attention was paid to this style during the Hsiianté period (1426 to 1435), and owing probably to the adoption of a special kind of foreign blue (known in Chinese as Su-n2-po, which appears to haye been obtainable during this period alone), a brilliancy of color was attained which was never afterwards quite equaled. At the same time, however, a brilliant red color attracted universal admiration. At first this was used by itself either as a uniform coloring over the outside of bowls and cups, or for the delineation of fishes or peaches upon the white ground, the contrast of the two colors, both striking in brilliancy, being highly admired. Then a form was adopted which, while it gave due prominence to the highly prized crimson, admitted of the introduction of other colors in a subordinate capacity, such as vessels in the shape of persimmons (Diospyros kak?) on a leafy branch forming the handle, the fruit being red, and the leaves and stalk of their natural colors, green of various shades and brown respectively. From this form of decoration it required but a step to reach the use of the enamel colors for which the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) is famous.
The use of enamel colors continued during the Hungchih period (1488 to 1505), some of the specimens being scarcely inferior to the best | pieces of Ch‘énghua ware, but gradually gave way in public favor to a pale yellow glaze covering an ornamentation engraved in the paste. This was also the most highly esteemed production of the Ch‘éngté period (1506 to 1521); though the efforts to obtain further supplies of blue from the west being crowned with success, a revival in favor of ‘*blue and white” china took place during this and especially the following reign till the supply was once more exhausted.
Peculation, misgovernment and its attendant disorders, and an increasing difficulty in finding the finer qualities of clay combined to cause a steady decline from this period onward in the artistic excellence of the porcelain produced. The rapidity of the downward course was considerably accelerated by the enormous extent of the imperial orders for the supply of the palace, which, sometimes aggregating 100,000 pairs of articles on a single occasion, taxed the resources of the government factories beyond their strength, with the result that, in order to economize money and labor, colors which were expensive or difficult to procure were replaced by others less costly and more simple in. their ingredients, and artistic beauty and excellence of workmanship were sacrificed to promptness in providing the supplies ordered. It is thé gradual dispersion of the articles comprised in the vast orders

issued during the Lungch‘ing (1567 to 1572) and Wanli (1573 to 1619) periods that has provided the bulk of the specimens in the possession of modern collectors of what has come to be considered (though, in view of the much higher artistic merit of the ware produced under earlier emperors, very unfairly considered) the characteristic Ming porcelain, porcelain somewhat coarse in make, faulty in shape, and decorated with paintings which, though characterized by boldness of design, are usually marked by want of care in execution.
While, however, the work of the government factories showed these unmistakable signs of decadence, strenuous efforts were made by a few isolated private manufacturers to raise the art to its earlier level of excellence. The imitations by Chou Tan-ch‘iian of the beautiful old Tingchow ware, and the cups of Hao Shih-chi of a ‘*dewy-dawn red” and of eggshell (the latter at times only weighing one-fortieth of an ounce apiece), are spoken of in terms of the highest admiration, and brought fabulous prices. But though these efforts were, if the statements of Chinese writers can be relied upon, crowned with complete success, so far as the artist’s individual productions were concerned, they were inadequate to prevent the downward tendency exerted by the government establishments at Chingté-chén, which had already for a long while almost monopolized the production of porcelain in China.
During the remainder of the period that the Ming dynasty held the throne its energies were so much occupied in endeavoring to suppress internal disorder and in resisting the attacks of the Manchu Tartars on its northern frontiers that no attention was paid to the ceramic art.
From 1403 tro 1424.
During the Yunglo period (1403 to 1424) much white porcelain, with ornamentation in blue under the glaze, commonly known in Europe as **blue and white china,” was manufactured, which holds third place in regard to excellence among this class of ware produced during the Ming dynasty, that of the Hsiianté period (1426 to 1435) occupying the first and that of the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) the second place. The blue employed is said, in the annals of Fouliang, to have been brought from some Mohammedan country as tribute, and was thence known as Mohammedan blue. During the Yunglo and Hsiianté periods it was termed Su-ma-li or Su-ma-ni blue, and during the latter Sw-n/-po also. Where this blue came from and whether these Chinese designations are the reproductions of the name of a country or of a color has never been determined. Doctor Hirth, while pointing out the resemblance of the former in sound to smalt (medizeval Latin s/altwm). and of the latter to Schneeberg, ‘* under which name the Saxon blue afterwards became famous all over the world,”'! thinks a search into Arabian
'F. Hirth, Ancient Chinese Porcelain, p. 65.

or Persian records of that day may yet supply the missing explanation. Whatever it was, the supply was exhausted during the Ch‘énghua period. Somewhat later, however (during the Chéngté period, 1506 to 1521), Tatang, the governor of Yiinnan province, succeeded in obtaining further supplies of Mohammedan blue by paying for it twice its weight in gold; and during this and the greater part of the subsequent reign (Chiaching period, 1522 to 1566) it continued available—a fact to which is doubtless attributable the excellent color of the productions of that time. Towards the close of the latter reign, however, the supply again gave out, when an incinerated cobaltiferous ore of manganese (termed wu-ming-7) replaced the western product; the color obtained from this native ore, far from equaling the brightness and transparency of the foreign blue, however, showed a dull and heavy tint after baking.
Eggshell porcelain of very delicate workmanship was produced, but owing to its extreme fragility good specimens are now difficult to obtain. It appears also to have had a tendency to crack during the process of firing. These porcelains are termed among the Chinese t‘o-t‘az, or porcelain from which the ‘‘ embryo” or biscuit has been removed, and are divided into two classes: ‘* True ¢‘o-¢‘az,” the very thin, also known as eggshell (¢an-p‘z or luan-mu), and ‘‘ semi ¢‘o-t*az,” the somewhat thicker. The true ¢‘o-¢‘az especially present great difficulties in the manufacture and require extraordinary dexterity in the handling, for so thin is the portion of the body the workman allows to remain that it seems as though all had been removed; and it is only quite recently that the Government manufactory at Sévres has succeeded in producing such porcelain, and then by an entirely different process by casting or moulage en barbotine.
The work translated by M. Julien states that while the production of this ware originated during the Yunglo period, it was only the thicker variety that was then made, and that the true ¢‘o-¢‘az dates from a later epoch, having been produced during the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) at the government manufactory and during the Lungch ‘ing (1567 to 1572) and Wanli (1573 to 1619) periods at private factories. This statement appears, however, to be erroneous; for in No. 295 of this collection will be found a specimen, so at least Chinese experts state, of the semi ¢‘o-¢*az (though it seems difficult to believe that a bowl of such size could be made much thinner and yet be of practical utility), and in Nos. 289 to 294 specimens of the true ¢‘o-¢‘a7, both having the inscription Ywng-lonien-chih, ** Made during the Yunglo period,” engraved in the old seal ~ character on itsfoot. Moreover, the one specimen of this ware described by Hsiang Tzt-ching is a small cup ‘‘as thin as paper,” called ¢‘o-¢‘az, ‘* bodyless,” 2. ¢., true ¢‘o-¢‘az, not semi ¢‘o-t‘az, of which he says ‘‘ there

are not a few of these wine cups left, yet they are highly appreciated by collectors of taste.” * Specimens of the Ch‘énghua eggshell will be found in Nos. 296 to 303. :
In spite of the extreme thinness of this ware, many specimens—such as Nos. 289 to 204, already referred to—are adorned with very elaborate designs engraved under the glaze (an operation requiring exceptional delicacy of workmanship), which are scarcely visible unless the vessel be held against the light or be filled with liquid: These specimens possess additional interest from the fact that they enable us tu picture to ourselves what the porcelain manufactured for the special use of the palace under the Yiian dynasty (the Shu-fw) and the Tingchow ware of the Sung dynasty were like; though, of course, these latter had not the thinness and delicacy of the eggshell porcelain. For Hsiang Tzt-ching, after describing a specimen of Shu-fu porcelain decorated with dragons in the midst of clouds and with lion’s head handles, all faintly engraved in the paste under a white glaze, states that *‘the porcelain of our own dynasty (the Ming) of the reigns of Yunglo and Hsiianté, decorated with patterns engraved under a white glaze, was made after this Shu-fu porcelain, which was itself copied from the Tingchou porcelain of the northerr Sung dynasty.” ”
From 1426 To 1435.
Among the porcelain manufactured during the Hsiianté period (1426 to 1435), that covered with crimson glaze or bearing designs in that color holds the highest place in the eyes of Chinese connoisseurs. ‘* It truly stands preeminent among the celebrated porcelains of different dynasties, a precious jewel of our own times,” says Hsiang Tzii-ching. Some of the descriptions left by this author are worth reproducing. (1) An incense burner from an old bronze design. ‘* The upper two-thirds of the body and the handles, which are molded in the form of fish, are covered with a deep red glaze of rosy dawn tint, the lower part enameled white, pure as driven snow, the two colors mingling in a curved line, dazzling the eyes.” (2) A wine pot (63 inches high), copied from a similar vessel of carved jade used by the emperor. ‘* The body, slender below, swelling towards the top, is decorated with engraved cloud scrolls and bands of geometrical and spiral pattern, with conical cover, spirally curved handle, and spout moulded and engraved in the form of a pheenix head, all covered with deep-red (chi hung) glaze.” It is said to have cost the owner 200 ingots of silver in paper notes, a sum Doctor Bushell estimates to be equivalent to about £600.
Another style of decoration much esteemed at the time for open vessels was ‘‘three red fish on a white ground pure as driven snow, the fish boldly outlined and red as fresh blood, of a brilliant color
1S. W. Bushell, Chinese Porcelain before the Present Dynasty, No. 61. 2Idem, No. 21.

<<<Page: 517>>>

dazzling the eyes.” Occasionally these fish would be represented on the outside swimming on waves engraved in the paste, with two more on the inside. Though no less than four vessels so decorated are described by Hsiang “Tati: ching, they are stated to have been even then ‘‘precious specimens of this rare kind of porcelain”—they are certainly so now.
A rarer kind of decoration still was three pairs of peaches in red on a white ground—of these ‘‘only two or three were then known to exist within the four seas,” that is, the Empire.
A still rarer decoration, found on a wine cup, is described as ‘‘ the white ground decorated inside and outside with cloud scrolls engraved in the paste, a scroll border above colored crimson: the handle a dragon of bold design moulded in high relief coiled round the top, with teeth and four claws fixed in the rim, enamelled vermilion red.” (Vessels with a dragon moulded in relief upon the brim are, it may be added, always highly esteemed by the Chinese when intact, partly because of the artistic ability required to successfully execute the design, and partly because old specimens are seldom met with undamaged.) ‘Only one or two of these beautiful little cups remain throughout the Empire, and 100 taels ($150 gold) is not considered too much to pay for a specimen.” Hsiang Tzt-ching states that the brilliancy of this crimson glaze was obtained by the‘addition of powdered red gems from the west to the ordinary materials. Doctor Bushell, commenting upon this statement, says ‘‘this is impossible, and the colors being painted on under the glaze shows it to have been a copper silicate, the same doubtless that gave the bright red (Aszen hung) to the monochromes of the period.”' M. Julien states that among the colors for porcelain painting brought from China by M. Itier (an employé in the ministry of finance, who accompanied the French ambassador to that country) and at in 1844 to the manufactory at Sevres, was one named pao-shih-hung, “precious stone red,” which when analyzed by M. Salvetat proved to be merely tiers de fer avec du fondant.” ” }
A decoration first met with in the productions of this period is obtained by the entire excision of a delicate pattern, by some sharp instrument, from the biscuit of which the cup or bowl is formed. When the vessel is dipped in the glaze, the latter fills up the excised open work with a thin film sufficiently thick after baking to retain the liquid in the cup, though so thin that the pattern is thrown out as a transparency upon the more opaque body. ‘This decoration is com monly known among English collectors as ‘‘lace-work,” and the French term pieces so decorated réticulés. ;

From 1465 To 1487.
During the Ch‘énghua period (1465 to 1487) the production of porcelain bearing a -blue decoration under the glaze continued, but owing chiefly to the fact that the supply of Su-nz-po blue from abroad was exhausted and partly from the growing preference for ornamentation in enamel colors, this ware was inferior in color to that of the Hsiianté period; and it is for the decoration in enamel colors that this period is chiefly and justly famous.
One authority states that among the productions.of this period are the most beautiful of wine cups, the upper part of which is adorned with a Chinese peony (Ponta moutan) and having at the base a hen and
chickens full of life and movement.’ Hsiang Tzi-ching thus describes a pair:
They are of rounded form, swelling below, so thin and delicate that one weighs less than a third of an ounce. The cockcombs, narcissus, and other flowers, the flying dragon fly and crawling mantis, painted after life, in green, yellow, and crimson enamel. These are choice specimens of the wine cups of this celebrated reign, and are valued at 100 taels the pair, yet now even for this money it is impossible to get them.”
: Another miniature wine cup described by him is said to have beenpurchased for 60 ounces of silver ($90), while a pair in the possession of one of the high officers of the court under the Emperor Wanli is
‘ said by another writer to have been valued at 1,000 ounces, or $1,500. : Whatever may be thought of the last statement, the prices mentioned ; by Hsiang Tzti-ching are fully confirmed by contemporary writers.
The Treatise on Pottery (the 7*ao-shuo) quotes from a work written towards the end of the Ming dynasty as follows:
On the days of new moon and of full moon I often went, while at the capital, to the fair at the Buddist temple Tz‘t-én-sst, where rich men thronged to look at the old porcelain bowls exhibited there. Plain white cups of Wanli porcelain were several ounces of silver each, those with the marks of Hsiianté and Ch‘énghua were twice as much more, up to the tiny cups decorated with fighting cocks, which could not be bought for less than a hundred ounces of the purest silver, pottery being valued far more highly than precious jade.*
=) wee < ee 7 a
From the time of the Emperor Wanli it was the endeavor of every man of taste, whose wealth could support such a strain, to set wine cups of Ch‘énghua ware before his guests. Considering how many pieces of this choice porcelain must have been thus sacrificed, it is not surprising that it is almost impossible to procure specimens at the present day— nearly three hundred years after they were selling at twelve times their weight in gold—though Doctor Bushell states that ‘‘one may be occasionally seen in a Chinese collection preserved in an ebony box

softly lined with padded silk.” Four specimens of these cups are contained in the collection—Nos. 300 to 303.
From this period also are supposed to date many of the large vases which form so prominent a feature in the European collections, decorated with historical scenes, in the coloring of which green plays so large a part, and which have in consequence been termed by French writers ‘‘la famille verte.” They are really, however, more modern. ‘‘The finest,” as Doctor Bushell truly remarks, ‘‘ belong to the reign of K‘anghsi, so that one of a pair is often found with a Ming mark beneath, the other with a censer, flower, or other emblem (of the K‘anghsi period); yet some connoisseurs pride themselves on being able to distinguish the genuine Ming in this class from the false, confessing, however, that it is a difficult matter.” * ,
This period is also noted for its eggshell porcelain. It was not, however, invented at this time, but, as we have already shown, first manufactured during the Yunglo period. The four small plates of this ware (Nos. 296 to 299) are worthy of special note, not only for their extreme thinness and transparency, but for the very unusual style of their decoration—landscapes in enamel colors above the glaze.
From 1488 To 1505.
During the succeeding period (Hungchih, 1488 to 1505), while enamel |
colors were still used, a very pale yellow glaze of the color of a newly husked chestnut was the tint most highly prized, the two kinds of decoration being at times combined. If the uniform yellow glaze was employed, ornamentation would be at times engraved in the paste or molded in relief beneath it. So little is said regarding the ware of this period by Chinese authors that it is worth while recording the descriptions of two choice specimens given by Hsiang Tzit-ching: (1) A wine pot ‘‘ molded in the form of a gourd contracted in the middle, the brown stalk forming the handle of the cover, a winding branch the tapering handle, from which spring green tendrils and leaves and a miniature gourd, all worked in relief in the yellow body, a second miniature gourd being fashioned into the spout. Light yellow was the color most highly valued in this reign, but enamelling in color was also employed, as in this piece, which reminds one of the porcelain of the reign of Ch‘énghua;” (2) a teacup ‘‘in the form of a hibiscus flower, covered outside with a delicate yellow glaze imitating the natural tint of the flower; white inside. I have seen many specimens of Hungechih porcelain, but nothing to surpass these little cups.””

From 1506 vo 1521.
During the Chéngté period (1506 to 1521), so far as the meager details chronicled allow us to judge, while decoration in enamel colors continued and the successful endeavors of the governor of Yiinnan to obtain further supplies of Mohammedan blue caused attention to be again turned to the production of porcelain ornamented with designs in blue under the glaze, the ware most highly prized was that covered with a yellow glaze, introduced under the previous reign, over patterns engraved in the paste, and a red monochrome termed ch/-hung. This term appears to have included two shades—one the pao-shih-hung, or **precious-stone red” already discussed under the Hsiianté period, (p. 335), and the Aszen-hung, a bright red, produced by a silicate of copper. This color, the Chinese records state, could not be successfully produced subsequent to this period under the Ming dynasty, owing seemingly to inability to maintain a suitable condition of atmosphere in the kiln—a difficulty explained by M. Salvetat thus:
Si l’atmosphére du four est trop réductrice, le cuivre passe a l’état de cuivre métallique; si l’atmosphére du four est trop oxydante, la coloration rouge disparait et la couverte devient verdatre (Recueil des travaux scientifiques de M. Ebelmen, Tome I, p. 437) ; le protoxyde de cuivre seul donne un silicate d’une couleur rouge.!
A curious kind of earthenware is mentioned by Hsiang Tziti-ching as having been produced in the Yi-hsing district, of the department of Changehou, Kiangsu province, by a celebrated potter named Kung Ch’un. Teapots of this ware were of a light brown like felt, or covered with a vermilion-red glaze. In either case the color is said to have changed to a bright green when tea was poured in, and to have gradually reverted to its original color, line by line, as the liquid was poured out. This curious peculiarity is said to have been merely the accidental result of some change effected by baking, but was highly prized by collectors—500 ounces of silver ($750) having been paid for the two specimens described by our author.’
From 1522 ro 1566.
During the Chiaching period (1522 to 1566) the yellow glaze, so particularly affected during the two previous reigns, appears to have been entirely, and decoration in enamel colors to have been almost entirely, abandoned, the old style of ornamentation in blue under the glaze being chiefly admired, till the supply of that color from the west was again exhausted during the later years of this reign; and to the present day the ‘* blue and white” of this period is much sought after by collectors. Apart from this, the only kind of ware at all remarkable

mentioned by Chinese writers is cups intended for use upon the palace altars, and hence termed f¢‘an-chan, which are said to have resembled white jade and to have been exceptionally beautiful. One maker, named Ts‘ui, who is stated to have lived during this and the following reign, is however mentioned as a successful imitator of the porcelain of the Hsiianté and Ch‘énghua periods, his productions being known as Ts‘ui-kung yao-tz‘v, ‘‘ Mr. Ts‘ui’s porcelain ware.” ?
From 1567 ro 1619.
During the Lungch‘ing (1567 to 1572) and Wanli (1573 to 1619) periods it appears to have been difficult to obtain supplies of good clay; and this fact, combined with the increasing disorder throughout the Empire and the enormous extent of the supplies ordered for palace use, caused a marked deterioration in the quality of the ware produced, though the workmanship is at times highly spoken of, especially in the case of porcelain decorated in enamel colors—the most highly prized having marks on them resembling ‘‘ millet grains,” or a surface marked as with the pittings on orange peel (Papparance chagrinée dune peau @ orange).
While, however, the productions of the government factories were marked by an ever-increasing decadence, serious efforts were made by private producers to stay the downward tendency, and two individuals would seem to have won for themselves and their ware a very high reputation. Chou Tan-ch‘iian, a native of Wumén, imitated the ancient masterpieces of Tinchow porcelain so successfully that the most expert connoisseurs failed, it is said, to detect the fraud, and willingly purchased them at such enormous sums as 1,000 ounces of silver each ($1,500). Another maker, of unknown origin, but whose name tradition says was Hao Shih-chiu, made cups of *‘ liquid-dawn tint,” bright as vermilion, and of egg-shell of a beautiful brilliant white, and weighing in some cases only just over half a pennyweight, or about onefortieth of an ounce, for which extravagant prices were paid. This all sounds, however, much exaggerated. Other productions of his were céladon vases resembling A’wan-yao, or the elder Chang’s ware (/to-yao), except that they were not crackled, and vases of a color which the French term feuille-morte, or fond laque, a brown or coffee tint, derived from ferruginous clay. This artist was known as /Zu-kung, ‘* Mr. Pots,” or Hu-yin-tao-jen, ‘*the Taoist hidden in a pot,” apparently pseudonyms adopted by him in allusion to an old legend preserved in the Shén-hsien-chuan, an ancient work on Taoist immortals, and signed his jars with the mark /Zu-yin-lao-jen, ‘‘the old man hidden in the pot.” According to the legend, Hu-kung, the Old Man of the Pot, was a magician, endowed with marvelous powers of healing, whe lived
18. Julien, L’ Histoire et la Fabrication de la Porcelaine Chinoise pp. 97, 100.

<<<Page: 522>>>

during the third and fourth centuries, and was accustomed to distribute in charity the vast sums he received in payment for his miraculous cures. He disappeared each night from mortal view, his retreat remaining a mystery till he was watched, when it was discovered that the leech was accustomed to withdraw at sunset to the interior of a hollow gourd which hung from a doorpost. Julien translated these characters as /e vieillard ou qui vit dans la retraite; but, says Doctor Hirth, ‘‘it seems to me that these four characters have rather an epigrammatic sense, and if translated into Latin would be among the most delicious of Martial’s Apophoreta; for the * old man,’ as the clever maker styles himself, *is concealed in the pot,’ like the fairy Hu-kung was in his, and although invisible, he himself—that is, his inventive genius—is contained in it. It impresses me as the most sympathetic device a ceramic artist could select as a mark.””?
The factories at Chingté-chén, which had been closed during the last years of the Ming dynasty, were not reopened till the Manchu emperors had firmly seated themselves upon the throne—during the reign of K‘anghsi (A. D. 1662 to 1722). Heand histwo successors, Yungchéng (1723 to 1735) and Chienlung (1736 to 1795), while maintaining the qualities which had enabled their race to gain its high position, at once adopted the civilization of the conquered nation. No less eminent as scholars and statesmen than as able generals, loving the magnificent but no less aiming at practical utility, they set vigorously to work to reform those portions of the theoretically admirable system of government which had been allowed to fall into decay, to improve and beautify the capital and its palaces, to diffuse education and to encourage the finearts. The factories at Chingté-chén were not slow to feel the effects of this change of system. The kilns increased rapidly in number, till at the date of P. d’Entrecolles’ letters, they aggregated over three hundred in full activity, the fires of which at night so illuminated the hills surrounding the plain in which the town stands, that it seemedas some vast city abandoned to the flames, and over a million souls found a means of livelihood in its busy streets. The production was not characterized by activity alone, however. The ablest artists were employed to paint and to design ornamentation, to enhance the beauty of which they at times availed themselves of foreign ideas; odes from the emperor’s pen were reproduced upon vases in facsimile, or short extracts were introduced as subjects for illustration; vases and cups were specially ordered to confer upon distinguished personages, their achievements being epitomized in the paintings which decorated these precious heirlooms (No. 169); the workmen and decorative artists were educated to

a higher level of proficiency; and the direction of the factories was confided to officers who were known to be possessed of the knowledge requisite for such a position. Progress was sure and rapid; and during the seventy-five years between 1698 and 1773—comprising roughly the latter half of K‘anghsi’s reign, the whole of Yungchéng’s, and rather more than half that of Chienlung—the manufacture and decoration of porcelain in China attained a degree of excellence which in my opinion has never been reached, either before or since.
During the early part of K‘anghsi’s reign (1662 to 1722) green was, as it had been among the later productions of the Ming dynasty—during the Lunghch‘ing and Wanli periods of 1567 to 1619—the predominating color employed in decoration, such porcelain being hence termed /a Famille verte; and to this period belongs, in part, much of the ware so decorated, which is usually ascribed to the earlier dynasty and is considered a characteristic Ming porcelain. To the colors applied under the glaze was now added a blue above glaze, which does not seem to have been known under the Mings. During the later years of this reign, however, green gave way to red as the predominating color, and a style of decoration was adopted which has been classed by M. Jacquemart and subsequent writers under the title of la famille rose. It is easily distinguished by its half tints and broken colors, having for decorative basis a carmine red lowered to pale rose, and obtained from gold, which is called in Europe purple of Cassius. The addition to their palette of this color, of yellow derived from antimony and of white from arsenical acid, enabled Chinese artists to considerably increase the variety and beauty of their decorations. A director of the government factories named Ts‘ang Ying-hsiian is mentioned by Chinese writers as having about this time gained considerable distinction by his productions, which were of thin porcelain, covered with a brilliant, and, in the most highly valued specimens, monochrome glaze. The colors are stated to have been ‘‘ snake-skin green,” ‘* mud-eel yellow,” blue, and dappled yellow. Other, but less esteemed, colors were pale yellow, pale violet, pale green, and blue or red, both souffle.
From 1723 to 1796.
Shortly after the accession of Yungchéng, Nien Hsi-yao was, in 1727, intrusted with the direction of the imperial manufactories. He personally selected the materials and superintended the execution of the Emperor’s orders. All the articles made by him—which are known as Nien porcelain, néen-yao—were graceful in form and of fine workmanship. They were chiefly monochrome in color, blue, bright and carmine reds, céladons, and ‘‘of egg color as bright as silver,” but some were ornamented with painted flowers, either incised or plain. Some of the monochrome vases, dating from this or a slightly later period, have lately obtained an extraordinary vogue among’ foreign collectors

and bring prices ridiculously above any value to which they could justly lay claim on the score of either rarity, color, or workmanship. A small vase only 8 inches high, of a dull white-pink shade upon an underground of pale sea-green, which has been dignified by the name of ‘‘peach blow” (in some specimens this underground forces itself into notice in the form of splotches on the pink), was offered to the writer in Pekin for less than $200 gold, and, having been purchased by a foreign dealer, was eventually sold in New York for $15,000. With Nien Hsi-yao was associated in the management a year later a Manchu officer in the lord chamberlain’s office named T‘angying, who fifteen years later succeeded to the sole direction. Possessing an intimate knowledge of the different varieties of clay and of the effects of fire upon them and on colors, he exercised the greatest care in the choice of materials, and every article made under his orders was remarkable for delicacy of workmanship, purity of form, and brilliance of coloring. He imitated with wonderful precision the most beautiful of the ancient designs, and his efforts at reproducing the most celebrated glazes were crowned with equal success. In addition, he is credited with the invention of several new styles of decoration, of which the most remarkable were: The use of European blues and violets, a ground of enamel black, white flowers or designs in gold upon a black ground, the French method of painting, and the yao-pien or flambé style. Ina word, ‘* under his direction,” Chinese writers state, ‘‘ the products of the imperial factories attained their highest perfection.*”
The work translated by M. Julien distinctly states that the introduction of the black grounds dates from the early part of Chienlung’s reign. ‘Treating, as this work does, of events of such comparatively recent occurrence, its reliability would at first glance seem scarcely open to doubt. Iam, however, strongly of opinion that the statement is erroneous, and that black grounds originated some decades earlier. I have seen specimens which, the black ground apart, have all the characteristics of the K‘anghsi period, and far inferior in delicacy of execution to specimens which were undoubtedly manufactured under the direction of T‘angying, such as No. 93 of this collection. The accuracy of the statement in other respects is, however, confirmed by experience. The use of violet, or of magenta with a violet tone, with most happy effect, especially for grounds, is one of the characteristics of this period, while the best blues fully equal anything in that color produced during the best periods of the Mings.
Special attention, as has been seen, was also paid at this time to the production of yao-pien, of which Chinese writers distinguish three kinds—two due to celestial agency; one, the fambé glaze, to human ingenuity. As regards the latter, oxydulated copper, it is well known, furnishes vitrifiable painting with a fine red. This, thrown ina body on a

vase, forms the tint called Aaricot, a kind of fawn color; with a further quantity of oxygen of equal amount a protoxide is formed, producing a beautiful green, that may be changed into sky-blue by increasing the | oxygenation. The tints upon a vase may thus be modified almost indefi| nitely by a due regulation at different periods during the process of baking of the currents of airadmitted. ‘* When a clear fire placed in a strong current draws a considerable column of air, all the oxygen is not consumed, and part of it combines with the metal; if, on the other hand, thick smoke is introduced into the furnace, of which the carbonaceous mass, greedy of oxygen, absorbs everywhere this gas, necessary for its combustion, the oxides will be destroyed and the metal completely restored. Placed at a given moment in these given conditions, by the rapid and simultaneous introduction of currents of air and of sooty vapors the haricot glaze assumes a most picturesque appearance; the whole surface of the piece becomes diapered with veins and streaked colorations, changing and capricious as the flame of spirits, the red oxydulate, passing by violet into pale blue and to the green protoxide, evaporates itself even completely upon certain projections, which become white, and thus furnishes happy accidental combinations.” * The supernatural changes are either of color, as when a piece of porcelain is taken from the kiln having developed a patch of some new color in a natural shape, or of form, ‘‘as when some unusually large slabs were requisitioned by one of the Ming emperors, which were transformed into beds and boats, with equipage complete, and forthwith broken up by the startled potters, as gravely reported by the official in charge by way of excuse for their absence.”” In the Buddhist temple Pao-kuo-ssti in Pekin is a famous yao-pien image of Yuanyin, a finely designed figure enamelled in colors, light blue, crimson, yellow, and two shades of brown; of which, in an ode from his pen engraved on the shrine, the Emperor Chienlung says the goddess descended into the kiln to fashion an exact likeness of herself.
The reference to the introduction to ‘* the French method of painting” is of so interesting a nature as to merit more detailed consideration.
The Jesuit missionaries of the seventeenth century gained for themselves a position of dignity and influence beside the Dragon throne such as no foreigner before or since has succeeded in attaining. This position, and a tolerance which saw nothing incompatible with the Catholic religion in the cherished observance of the Chinese—in the payment of official honors to the sage Confucius and in the performance of certain rites in honor of ancestors erroneously termed ‘‘ ancestral worship”—caused a remarkable spread of Catholicism, which, owing to the labors of Father Ricci and his successors, had already established itself under the Ming dynasty, counting among its members many —

officials and the consort of the last of the line, who proclaimed himself emperor in the Kwangtung (Canton) province. But Pope Clement XT’s bull Zr ila die, confirming an earlier bull on the same subject dated the 4th November, 1704, by deciding that these observances were incompatible with Catholic belief, aroused violent anger on the part of the Emperor K’anghsi and dealt a blow to the missions from which they have never recovered. The Emperor died before the legate specially sent to China to carry out the bull could perform his promise to endeavor to persuade the Pope to modify its terms; and decrees of great severity were issued against Christianity by his successors, Yungchéng and Chienlung, to which Pope Benedict XIV replied in 1742, by issuing a bull deciding this unfortunate question in its narrowest sense. The severity of the imperial decree was, however, mitigated in favor of the missionaries at court—at first Jesuits, and after the dissolution of that order Lazarists; and a European divine continued to be a director of the board of astronomy down to 1814.
The influential position occupied by the Jesuits was both won and maintained chiefly by their high attainments in astronomy, in mathematics, and in geometry. It, however, enabled these able and enlightened representatives of western learning to exercise a considerable degree of influence upon other matters not directly connected with the studies for which they were chiefly famous, but in which their scientific education gave them the power and right to speak with authority. When, therefore, contemporaneously with the enjoyment by them of this position of influence, a style of decoration was adopted for porcelain and enamels for both imperial and general use purely European in its character—not only in the more intimate acquaintance, as compared with previous native drawing, of the laws of perspective displayed, but even in the reproduction of European dress and figures and eminently European scenes and pastimes—it seemed that this could scarcely be mere coincidence. It was more natural to suppose that under the direction of one of these able missionaries a school had been established in connection with the government porcelain factories for instruction in European designs, in European ideas of grouping floral ornamentation, and in the European style of painting generally. Pére d’Entrecolles, it is true, makes no allusion in his famous letters to such a school. But, as they were written for the purpose of enlightening the west regarding the composition of the materials and the system of manufacture employed by the Chinese, the use of European designs in the decoration of porcelain might well have been passed over in silence, and the absence of such reference would not necessarily prove that such a school had not existed.
The supposition that some of the Jesuits were at this time more or less intimately associated with the manufacture and decoration of porcelain

experts, that the secret of the composition of the sang-de-beuf coloring and of its peculiar glaze marked with pittings resembling those noticeable on orange peel (specimens of which are now so highly prized by _ collectors) was discovered by a missionary, and that its Chinese designation (Lang-yao or Lang ware) preserves to the present day the first syllable of the inventor’s surname.* Researches kindly undertaken at my request by Abbe Alphonse Favier, the vicar-general of Chihli proyince, into the ancient episcopal records and valuable library at Pekin have, however, failed to discover any mention of the establishment under missionary direction of a school for the special purpose of porcelain decoration. Had it existed, the fact would undoubtedly have been chronicled in the records left by such careful and methodical workers as these Jesuit priests were; and the explanation which the existence of such a school would have afforded must therefore be abandoned. Abbe Favier, however, informs me that Brothers Castiglione and Attirer were noted painters at Pekin both of portraits and of landscapes, and that they formed a school, paintings by their pupils having come into his possession. It may, then, I think, be confidently assumed that the imperial family having in the first instance been struck with the beauty of the ornamentation on the enamel watches, snuff boxes, ete., which came to China from France during the reign of Louis XIV, a somewhat similar style of decoration was introduced about 1728, or shortly after, for articles intended for imperial use; and that subsequently the Jesuit brothers, Castiglione and Attirer, were commissioned to execute European designs. which were sent to Chingté-chén, to be there copied on porcelain. As no article which was not perfect in every detail could be forwarded to Pekin, many of the pieces ordered for the court would then (as now) be rejected by the superintendent of the manufactory, and be retained by him or his subordinates. These would gradually pass into other hands, and, possessing at once the charm of novelty and the merit of being in a style appreciated at court, would serve as models in the decoration of more ordinary ware. About the same period—that is, during the later years of Yungchéng’s reign, which ended in 1735—Ku Yiieh-hsiian, a subordinate officer, I believe, in the directorate of the Chingté-chén factories, introduced the use of an opaque-white vitreous ware for the manufacture of articles
‘In China omne ignotum pro magnifico is especially true; and, as in the case of the beautiful red coloring of the Hsiianté period, so in the sang-de-beuf, the brilliant tint is commonly believed to result from the use of powdered rubies. The fact that in the list of missionaries of that time I could find none with the surname Lang, caused me to doubt the reliability of this generally accepted explanation; and on expressing my doubts to the late Chang Yen-Moan, for many years a member of the Chinese foreign office and minister to the United States, who was himself an ardent collector of ancient paintings and porcelain, he assured me that the name had no connection with the Jesuits, but was derived from the surname of the governor of Kiangsi province at the time that ware was first made, Lang Ch‘ao-t‘ing,

<<<Page: 528>>>

of small dimensions, such as snuff bottles, wine cups, vessels for washing pencils in,.etc. The vitreous nature of the body imparted a tone and brillianey to the colors used in the decoration which was greatly admired; and, under the auspices of T‘angying, all the artistic and technical skill of the government factory was lavished upon these little gems, which are certainly among the masterpieces, if not tie masterpieces, of ceramic art in China, being valued more highly than jade by Chinese connoisseurs of the present day. The decoration of the best specimens of this ware will well repay minute study. The choice of groundwork is effective, the grouping of the colors soft and harmonious, the introduction of European figures is interesting, and the arrangement of flowers evidences the highest artistic skill. Nos. 324 to 327 are admirable specimens of this very rare ware. ‘The earliest pieces were marked, usually in red, ta-ch‘ing-nien-chih, ‘* Made during the great Pure (the Ch‘ing or present) dynasty,” as in No. 323; the later pieces, during Chienlung’s reign (1736 to 1705), had the mark within a square seal-like border, Chien-lung nien-chih, ‘*Made during the reign of Chienlung,” engraved in the foot, and filled with a thick, bright-blue enamel glaze. It is said that when specimens of this ware were submitted to the Emperor Yungchéng he expressed his high admiration of their beauty, but at the same time a regret that it should not be possible to obtain the same brilliant transparency of color upon the ground of greater purity which was afforded by the best porcelain as compared with the vitreous composition employed. T‘angying’s energies were immediately devoted toward fulfilling the Emperor’s desire, his efforts being certainly crowned with a very large measure of success. He appears to have employed for his purpose a very pure glaze of a highly vitrifiable nature, and to have thereby obtained an enamel brilliancy that no other porcelain shows, and to have also secured to a considerable extent the same soft transparency in the decorative colors which was so much appreciated on Ku Yiieh-hsiian’s vitreous ware. The manufacture of this porcelain appears to have been carried on simultaneously with that of the Ku Yiieh-hsiian proper, some dating from Yungchéng’s reign and some from Chienlung’s. The marks it bears correspond exactly with the later products of vitreous composition, and, indeed, owing to its origin, it is known as Fang-ku-yiich-hsiiun, “modeled on the pattern of the Ku Yiieh-hsiian.” Specimens of this porcelain, which is quite rare, are held in very high esteem by the Chinese, alike for the purity of the paste, the brilliance of the glaze, and the beauty of the decoration, and are considered among the finest productions of the period during which the manufacture attained its highest excellence. Nos. 328 to 336 are good specimens, and afford a fair criterion of the merits of this porcelain.
The three-quarters of a century above mentioned (1698 to 1773) was marked by the production of articles which are masterpieces of Chinese

_ ingenuity and of skillful workmanship. Vases of various forms are
fitted with a central ring, which, while it is separate from the vase and __
movable at will in a horizontal direction, still can not be detached. Other vases there are having the body formed of two shells, the outer portion consisting in part of a geometric design or of bunches of flowers in openwork, revealing a historical representation, or a group of flowering plants beautifully painted upon the inner tube. Others, again, exhibit the peculiarities of both these varieties combined, it being possible to make the openwork exterior revolve, in order to bring to light the painted decoration within, but without possibility of separating it from the vase itself. There are still others of which the exterior shell is divided into two, generally unequal, parts, each having scalloped or lambrequin edges some inches in depth, which fit exactly into one another, but are still movable, though neither can be detached entirely from the internal body. What process was adopted to secure this mobility and prevent the movable section from becoming attached to the other portions of the vase in the process of baking is a mystery which has never as yet, I believe, been satisfactorily explained. The beautiful hexagonal and octagonal lamp shades of delicately thin porcelain, either reticulated or ornamented with paintings and reticulated edges, are productions of this period equally admired and now no less rare than the above.
During Chienlung’s reign a considerable change is noticeable in the style of ornamentation—a change undoubtedly brought about by the influence of foreign designs. During the latter portion of the Ming dynasty, though arabesque decoration was known to the Chinese under the title of hwei-huei, or Mohammedan style, and was also utilized, the
ornamentation upon porcelain, when it was not floral in its character or ©
formed of historical or mythological scenes, consisted almost entirely of reproductions of the patterns found upon the brocaded satins of that date. Under the earlier emperors of the present dynasty, though the decoration was marked by greater wealth of detail and by far greater artistic skill than at any previous time, in remained in essentiai character the same. On Chienlung porcelain, however, it exhibits a decided tendency towards the styles-of western decoration, showing in some cases a close resemblance to the foliate ornamentation which plays so important a part in the illumination of medizval missals, in others to designs which are usually considered Persian or arabesque in their origin. This marked modification is no doubt due in part to the influence of the designs sent from Persia to be copied in China on porcelain ordered from that country, and after their return home to that of the Chinese potters (whom Shah Abbas I, about the year 1600, had invited to Persia, with the object of improving the manufacture of porcelain at Ispahan), and in part to the influence of the Limoges enamels, which had been sent by Louis XIV to the Emperor K‘anghsi and which,
‘sibie ~

subsequent to that date, succeeding emperors had obtained from the Jesuit missionaries. These enamels seem indeed to have served as models to be reproduced with fidelity in every detail. For M. du Sartel gives the drawing of a low, open porcelain cup with two handles in the collection of M. Marquis of Paris, which is described as being the exact counterpart of a Limoges enamel, even the signature J. L. (Jean Landrin, an enameller of that town) being reproduced upon the foot.
At about the same period it became customary for nobles and wealthy individuals in Europe to order services of porcelain from China bearing their family arms. Indeed if tradition can be trusted the practice originated two centuries earlier; for the Emperor Charles V (1519 to 1555) is said to have ordered from China a complete service ornamented with his armorial bearings and monogram. The service is supposed to have passed into the hands of the Elector of Saxony after the emperor’s withdrawal to Innspruck, and some plates now in the Dresden collection, marked with a double C, inclosing the crowned doubleheaded imperial eagle, with coat of arms and collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, are believed by the writers responsible for the above statement to be portions of this service. Judging, however, from the style of decoration, Iam of opinion that this belief is erroneous, and that the plates in question were manufactured more than a century later than Charles V’s abdication. The French Compagnie @ Orient et des Indes Orientales, whose title was shortly afterwards changed to Compagnie de Chine, during the short period it existed, 1685 to 1719, brought from China, together with an extensive supply of other porcelains, services specially ordered, bearing the arms of France, of Penthiévre, and of other distinguished families. Some of the services, as, for instance, the plates bearing the arms of England, France, and the provinces of The Netherlands, preserved in the Huis ten Bosch at The Hague, undoubtedly date from the first half of K‘anghsi’s reign, but the great majority are of later origin, and possess a considerable degree of excellence both as to form and decoration.
From 1796 To 1820.
The truly great monarchs K‘anghsi, Yungchéng, and Chienlung" were succeeded by Chiach‘ing (1796 to 1820), Chienlung’s idle and dissolute son, whose administration was characterized by a feebleness hitherto unknown under Manchu rule, and was so detested as to occasion attempts to assassinate the vicegerent of Heaven—a stupendous crime in sucha country asChina. The porcelain factories, in common with all branches of the Government service, languished
under the effects of this want of energy, and little worthy of special
mention was manufactured. As the result of the high excellence
'Chienlung abdicated in order to escape disrespect to his grandfather by occupying the throne for so long a period as he had reigned.

<<<Page: 531>>>

already attained, good work continued to be performed, but it fell short of what the court had grown accustomed to, and no initiative was taken to attempt originality either in design or decoration.
From 1821 to 1850.
Chiach‘ing was succeeded by his second son, who assumed the title of Taokuang (1821 to 1850), a ruler whose good intentions to root out the abuses that had grown up during his father’s reign were largely neutralized by naturalindolence. His difficulties were, besides, greatly increased by the war with France and England, and the outbreak shortly after of the great T‘aip‘ing rebellion, which during his reign and that of his son (Hsienféng, 1851 to 1861) devastated sixteen out of the eighteen provinces of the Chinese Empire, and threatened the overthrow of his dynasty. Notwithstanding these serious causes for anxiety, he found time to devote some attention to the ceramic art, and the porcelain manufactured for his own use, and marked with the designation he gave to his own palace, Shen-té-t‘ang, compares not unfavorably with similar productions under Yungchéng and Chienlung, and is at the present day much sought after by Chinese connoisseurs.
From 1850 Tro 1888.
The productions of his successor are marked by rapid decadence, and the rebels, when they overran Kiangsi province, having entirely destroyed Chingté-chén and its factories, the manufacture of porcelain ceased entirely.
During the reigns of his son T‘ungchih (1862 to 1874) and nephew Kuanghsii (1875 to date) the manufacture has been renewed and great attention paid to its improvement, but it still falls far short of the classic periods of Yungchéng and of Chienlung. Some of the decorations in sepia exhibit considerable artistic merit, and a style of decoration consisting of flowers and butterflies in black and white upon a pale turquoise ground was highly appreciated some fifteen years ago among foreigners. The greatest measure of success has, however, of late years been gained in the reproduction of the famille verte decoration of the Grst half of K‘anghsi’s reign, and of this ornamentation or of plum blossom on black grounds. So good are these imitations that a practised eye can alone detect the false from the real, and I have known a pair of black-ground vases, only two or three years old, purchased by a foreign dealer for over $1,000, under the belief, no doubt, that they dated from the time of K‘anghsi or of Chienlung.
M. Brongniart said that porcelain was first introduced into Europe by the Portuguese in 1518. Researches made since the publication of this work in 1844 prove, however, that oriental porcelain was known in

<<<Page: 532>>>

Europe many years prior to that date. In New College, Oxford, is still preserved a céladon bowl mounted in silver richly worked, known as “‘Archbishop Warham’s cup” and bequeathed by that prelate (1504 to 1532) to the college, which was imported into England before the reign of Henry VIII. Marryat, in his history of Porcelain, also mentions some bowls which were given to Sir Thomas Trenchard by Philip of Austria when, after leaving England to assume the throne of Castile in 1505, he was driven back by a storm to Weymouth and entertained there by Sir Thomas. These bowls are said to have been preserved by the Trenchards, and to be of white porcelain decorated with blue under glaze. From M. du Sartel’s work we learn that amongst presents sent by the Sultan to Lorenzo de Medici in 1487 were porcelain vases; and that this ware is mentioned about the same time in the maritime laws of Barcelona as one of the articles imported from Egypt. In letters, too, addressed by the Venetian ambassador at the court of Teheran in 1471 to his government frequent mention is made of porcelain; and some decades earlier, in 1440, the Sultan of Babylonia sent three bowls and a dish of Chinese porcelain (de porcelaine de Sinant),' to Charles VU, King of France, by the hands of a certain Jean de Village, the agent in that country of a French merchant named Jacques Ceeur.
Nearly three centuries earlier still, mention is made in an Arabian manuscript, known as the Makrizi Manuscript, in the National Library, Paris, and translated by the Abbé Renaudot, of a service of chinaware, consisting of forty pieces of different kinds, sent with other presents to Nur-ed-din, the Kaliph of Syria, by his lieutenant, Saladin (afterwards the hero of the Crusades), soon after his conquest of Syria, in the year of the Hegira 567 (A. D. 1188). ‘‘This,” says Mr. A. W. Franks in the catalogue of his own collection, now in the British Museum, ‘‘is the first distinct mention of porcelain out of China,” but, in common with other writers on the subject, he refers the date of the present to 1171, though that year appears not to correspond with the Mohammedan date mentioned in the original text.
From Chinese sources (the Jfng-shih, or History of the Ming Dynasty, and the Hsi-yang-ch‘ao-kung-tien-lu, or Records of ‘Tribute Missions from the West) we learn that the famous eunuch Chéngho carried Chinese arms as far as Ceylon during the reign of Yunglo (1408 to 1425); that under his successor in 1480 the same eunuch and an associate envoy, Wang Ching-hung, were sent on a mission to Hormuz and sixteen other countries, and that Chéngho dispatched some of his subordinates on commercial ventures to Calicut, on the coast of Malabar, and even as far west as Djiddah, the port of Mecca. ‘‘ En 1431 ou 1432,” says Heyd,’ ‘‘on y vit méme arriver plusieurs jonques chinoises

qui n’avaient pas trouvé a écouler leurs marchandises & Aden dans de bonnes conditions. On les y recut avec empressement dans Vespoir que leur visite serait le début d’un traffic avec la Chine.” ‘The expedition was evidently a large one, and one of its objects was commercial intercourse, porcelain being specially mentioned among the articles with which the vessels were freighted. Porcelain had, however, reached these countries at a far earlier date. Marco Polo, traveling in 1280, mentions the trade in this ware from Quinsai, the present Hangchou, and from Zaitun, a port on the Fukien coast, which has been identified with Ch‘iianchou (better known as Chinchew) by Klaproth and other writers, whose view has been adopted by Colonel Yule in his magnificent edition of that famous traveler’s voyages, and with Changchou and its port, Geh-Kong (a short distance south from Chinchew, and inland), by Mr. George Philips, of Her British Majesty’s consular service in China. And Ibn Batuta, an Arabian traveler, who wrote in 1310, states distinctly that ‘‘ porcelain in China is worth no more than pottery is with us; it is exported to India and other countries, from which it is carried even to our own land Maghreb,” that is, the sunset, the name given by the Arabs to all that part of Africa which _ lies to the west of Egypt.
Chinese history fully confirms the above statement, and, indeed, shows that this commerce had already long existed at the time Ibn Batuta wrote. Ina gigantic compilation of the works of earlier authors undertaken during the reign of Yunglo (hence termed the Ywng-lo-ta-tien), the manuscript of which was presented to the throne in 1407, is preserved ‘‘an account of the countries fringing the Chinese border” (Chu-fan-chih), written by Chao Ju-kua, who was inspector of foreign trade in Fukien during the Sung dynasty. As the author speaks of the time of Mohammed ‘‘as twenty-nine generations, or six or seven hundred years ago,” his work would seem to have been written during the first half of the thirteenth century; but as he mentions a tribute mission sent by the Arabs to China in the K‘aihsi period (1205 to 1208), probably later than the latter date. The compilation was, however, considered too extensive and the printing was never completed, though the more important works relating to periods preceding the Yitan dynasty were reedited and published by the Emperor Chienlung. One of these was Chao Ju-kua’s work. It contains much valuable information regarding the Arab trade of the twelfth century, and, as it takes Chii‘anchou (Chinchew) as the starting point from which all voyages start and distances are computed, it appears to support Klaproth’s identification of Marco Polo’s Zaitun with that town. From this work it is evident that a large and valuable trade was carried on between China and Brni in Borneo, with Chanch‘éng, comprising a

portion of Cochin China, with Cambodia (Chén/a), with Java (Shé-po), with San-po-ch‘7, which another Chinese work, the Ying-hai-shéng-lan, states to be another name of Palembang (/%-/in-pang) in Sumatra—at which latter place the products of China and countries south of it were stored up for barter with Arab traders for the goods of Europe, India, west Asia, and Africa—and with Lambri, on the northwest coast of the same island. Occasionally Chinchew junks proceeded onward to Coilom, a well-known seaport (the present Quilon) on the coast of Malabar, which is described under the name of Lampi; butas a rule it would seem that the trade westward was in the hands of the Arabs, and Chao Ju-kua mentions, indeed, incidentally that a family from Malabar was established in the southern suburb of Chinchew itself. From this point the goods were carried to Guzerat (‘//uch‘a-la), as part of the country of Lampi, and thence to the Arab colony in Zanzibar (ts‘éngpa, Cantonese ts‘ang pat*ts‘ang par). Porcelain is distinctly mentioned among the principal articles carried away from China by the vessels to each of these ports and to Ceylon.* The correctness of this author’s statements has lately been confirmed in a striking manner. Sir John Kirk, during his residence in Zanzibar as consul-general, formed a collection of ancient Chinese céladon porcelain, some of the specimens having been dug up from ruins, mixed with Chinese coins of the Sung dynasty.
Indeed it seems very probable that porcelain was sent at least as far westas India in the tenth century, or even earlier; for commercial relations between China and Sumatra are stated to have existed from the Tienyu period (904 to 909) of the T’ang dynasty, and the name Sar baza, or Palembang, was known to Arab traders of that time, as we learn from translations of their travels by Renaudot and Reinaud. They were also acquainted with Chinese porcelain, for mention is made by one of them, Soliman by name, who visited China toward the middle of the ninth century, ‘‘of a very fine clay in that country, of which vases are made having the transparence of glass; water can be seen through them.”” Indeed earlier, during the eighth century, Arab writers mention the presence in the Persian Gulf of fleets of large Chinese junks.
At that date the Arab trade with China was evidently extensive, and the colonies of Arabs at Canton and at Canfu, the port of Quinsai (the present Hangchow), very large. They are said to have been so numerous at the former place in the eighth century as to have been able to attack and pillage the city. While at Canfu the Soliman above referred to (the manuscript account of whose travels was written, says his commentator, Abu Zaid Al Hasan, in A. D. 851)

mentions the fact that ‘*a Mohammedan held the position of judge over
those of his religion, by the authority of the Emperor of China, who is judge of all the Mohammedans who resort to those parts. Upon festival days he performs the public service with the Mohammedans, and pronounces the sermon or kotbat, which he concludes in the usual form, with prayers for the Sultan of Moslems. The merchants of Irak—that is, Persi * are no way dissatisfied with his conduct or administration in this port, because his decisions are just and equitable and conformable to the Koran.” And the commentator on these travels, Abu Said Al Hasan, who probably wrote earlier in the tenth century, when speaking of the interruption then recently caused in ‘‘the ordinary navigation from Siraf. to China,” says this to have been occasioned by the revolt of ‘‘an officer who was considerable for his employment, though not of royal family,” named Baichu. He laid siege to Canfu in the year of the Hegira 264 (A. D. 885). ‘‘At last he became master of the city, and put all the inhabitants to the sword. There are persons fully acquainted with the affairs of China, who assure us that, besides the Chinese who were massacred on this occasion, there perished 120,000 Mohammedans, Jews, Christians, and Parsees, who were there on account of traffic. The number of the professors of these four religions who thus perished is exactly known, because the Chinese are exceedingly nice in the accounts they keep of them.” *
Apart, however, from the sea route, porcelain might possibly have followed the course of the overland traffic through central Asia, the use of which can be traced back to a very remote antiquity, some authorities claiming that there are indications of communication by this route between China and the West so early as 2698 B. C., and that in 2353 B. C. an embassy arrived in China from a country which is supposed to have been Chaldea.” There is, therefore, nothing impossible in the claim put forward that a small ivory-white plate having uncut emeralds and rubies, set in gold filigree, let into paste, and the Chinese word fu (happiness) marked on the foot in the seal character under the glaze, now in the royal collection at Dresden, was brought into Europe by a crusader of the twelfth century; provided, of course, the paste, glaze, etc., correspond with those which characterize the porcelain manufactured in China about that date or prior to it.
What then was the porcelain that participated in this early trade? Chao Ju-kua, in the single instance, in which he alludes to its color, states it to have been ‘‘ white and ch’ing, or céladon.” It would almost necessarily have consisted of strong, coarse ware, in order to resist the

chances of breakage consequent upon the many transshipments incidental to these long voyages in the rude craft of those early ages, and to allow its sale at the comparatively cheap rates at which it was disposed of in Ibn Batuta’s day. Colonel Yule has thought that during the Yiian dynasty it probably came from the Chingté-chén manufactories, but this scarcely seems probable, for the 7’ao-shuo, or Treatise on Pottery, says that no porcelain was then made there, except by imperial order and for the court. Zaitun—whether Chinchew, Changchow, or ‘‘the Amoy waters” (Doctor Douglas’s compromise between the two)—as the headquarters of the western trade, would nattrally receive supplies for export of Awan-yao and of Ao-yao (both céladon in color) from the not far distant factories at Hangchow and Lungch’iian, respectively, as well as from the more distant factories, most of the productions of which were at this time also céladons. And céladon porcelains bearing all the distinctive characteristics of the Chinese manufactures of that nature have been discovered in almost all parts of the then Mohammedan world and in the countries visited by the early Arab traders. 2
Mr. Carl Bock, speaking in his Head Hunters of Borneo of the Dyak, says: ,
Among his greatest treasures are a series of gudji blanga, a sort of glazed jar imported from China, in green, blue, or brown, ornamented with figures of lizards and serpents in relief. These pots are valued at from 100 florins to as much as 3,000 florins (£8 to £240) each, according to size, pattern, and, above all, old age, combined with good condition. According to native legend, these precious vases are made of the remnants of the same clay from which Mahatara (the Almighty) made first the sun and then the moon. Medicinal virtues are attributed to these urns, and they are regarded as affording complete protection from evil spirits to the house in which they are stored. A very full account of the various legends comuected with these gudjyi blanga is given in Mr. W. T. H. Perelace’s most interesting work Ethnographische Beschreibiing der Dyaks, pp. 112-120."
Mr. Bock saw Doctor Hirth’s collection of Lungch‘iian céladons, and found in it pieces resembling the ware preserved by the Dyaks,
1 The possession of these vessels by the Dyaks, their use and value, are also chronicled by earlier travelers. The belief in the efficacy of porcelain vessels to detect poison in liquids contained in them is of ancient date and not confined to Asia alone, though the manner in which the porcelain was affected by the presence of poison appears to have varied in different cases. Thus, Guido Pancirolli, the learned jurisconsult and antiquary of Padua (d. 1599), and his editor, Salmutti (Guidonis Pancirolli, J. C., claris. rerum memorabilium libri duo; ex Italico Latiné redditi et eotis illustrati ab Henrico Salmutti, Antwerp, 1612) say that the presence of poison caused the porcelain either to break or to change color; while Dumont, in his Travels in Turkey, 1699, says that it caused the liquid to effervesce in the center while it remained cool near the vessel itself, the Turks, owing to this property, preferring porcelain to silver as the material of dinner services. Salmutti mentions the presentation to himself of one of these vessels by an Austrian prince, and Paul Hentzner (Itnerarium Galliz, Angliz, Italize, 1616) says he saw some of them in the Farnese Palace at Rome.

but specimens are, it appears, common among them which bear no resemblance to any of the celebrated monochrome wares of the Sung and Yiian dynasties, a fact Doctor Hirth would explain by supposing that ‘‘they came from factories equally old, but less renowned, such as the place where the Chien-yao of the Sung dynasty was made, the city of Chien-yang in the north of Fukien, which is all the more likely since Chao Ju-kua, in his description of the trade with Borneo, specially mention ‘ brocades of Chien-yang’ among the articles of import there.” *
A controversy has, however, recently arisen as to whether the céladon vases found throughout the Mohammedan world are really of Chinese origin at all. Professor Karabacek, an Arabic scholar of Vienna, maintains that the ‘‘ large, heavy, thick, green céladon dishes with the well-known ferruginous ring on the bottom, which have been found spread over all the countries of Arab civilization,” are not of Chinese origin, basing his theory mainly on the statement made by Hadschi Chalfa, an encyclopedist who died in 1658, that ‘‘the precious magnificent céladon dishes and other vessels seen in his time were manufactured and exported at Martaban, in Pegu.” The Arab designation Martabani is applied by Professor Karabacek to the thick, heavy céladons. It would, however, appear to have been also applied toa variety of entirely different character.
Jacquemart, in his History of the Ceramic Art, quotes Chardin’s Voyages en Perse as follows: ‘‘ Everything at the King’s table is of massive gold or porcelain. There is a kind of green porcelain so precious that one dish alone is worth 400 crowns. They say this porcelain detects poison by changing color, but that is a fable; its price arises from its beauty and the delicacy of the material, which renders it transparent although above two crowns in thickness,” and then adds: ‘‘This last peculiarity has a great importance. It is impossible to suppose travelers would here allude to the sea-green céladon—this, laid upon a brown, close paste approaching stoneware, is never translucent. In the martabani, on the contrary, a thin, bright, green glaze is applied upon a very white biscuit, which allows the light to appear through. * * * Its name leaves no doubt of its Persian nationality. Martaban (J/o-ta-ma) is one of the sixteen states which composed the ancient Kingdom of Siam; it would not be impossible, then, that we must restore to this kingdom the porcelain mentioned in the Arabian story.”
No porcelain, however, is known to have been made at Moulmien (Martaban), Bangkok, or Burma, and the burden of evidence is strongly against Professor Karabacek’s contention of a non-Chinese origin for the martabani or céladon porcelain. Probably the designation martabani was applied to this ware in much the same manner as
‘F. Hirth, Ancient Chinese Porcelain, p. 50.

‘*Combronware” was applied in England after 1623 to porcelains brought from China to that port on the Persian Gulf, and purchased there for shipment home by the factory of the India Company before itextended its operations to China (when these products came to be termed ‘‘ Chinaware”), or in the same manner that ‘‘ Indian China” is applied in America to porcelain shipped from Canton, and with as much reason.
Indeed, M. du Sartel, in accord with most other writers on the subject, maintains that no true porcelain was produced in Persia at all, and that the designation of such ware 7chinz not only means that the earliest specimens and mode of manufacture were of Chinese origin, but that they one and all actually came from China. The Persians, it is true, manufactured a kind of ware which has been designated ‘‘ Persian porcelain,” but it was of so soft a nature that it could be not only scratched, but actually cut, with a knife, and was entirely distinct from hard, kaolinic porcelain. The supplies of the latter were, M. du Sartel maintains, derived entirely from China, to which country models, shapes, and special kinds of ornamentation were sent for reproduction, a custom which sufficiently explains the presence of a Persian name, or the word fermaiche (** by order”), written in Arabic characters, upon porcelain of undoubtedly Chinese origin.
This opinion requires, I apprehend, further investigation prior to its acceptance as fact. It is, however, recorded that Shah Abbas I, a great patron of all the arts, about the year 1600 invited a number of Chinese potters to establish themselves at Ispahan for the sake of introducing improvements in the manufacture of porcelain. Though several new methods were adopted, and though a new style of decoration, half Chinese, half Persian, was largely used for a long period after the arrival of these potters, it is generally admitted that no hard porcelain resembling that of China was even then produced in Persia. And one can not help being struck by the strong similarity, amounting practically to identity, between the vases contained in the cases devoted to so-called Persian porcelain in the Dresden collection and certain other vases in the same collection which are classed as Chinese.
Whatever the variety of the Chinese porcelain was which constituted so important a factor in this early Arab trade, and whatever the date at which it made its first appearance in Europe, specimens of it had, prior to the beginning of the second half of the seventeenth century, found a place in the collections of princes alone. About that time, however, Chinese porcelain became more generally known, and the fine quality of the glaze, its transparency, and the brilliant style of its decoration excited universal admiration. Strenuous efforts were at once made on all sides to discover the secret of its manufacture, but

<<<Page: 539>>>

these researches, though resulting indirectly in other discoveries and in great progress in the European manufacture, were not crowned with success. They had, in fact, led to the creation, in France and England, of soft porcelain, which, if in some respects superior to the Chinese porcelain from a decorative point of view, was also more fragile and more easily scratched than the latter. This soft porcelain was made in France, at St. Cloud perhaps about 1695, at Chantilly in 1735, at Vincennes in 1740, and at Sévres in 1756; and in England, at Chelsea in 1745, at Derby in 1748, and at Worcester in 1751. Recourse was then had to the Jesuit missionaries in China, with the result of obtaining the valuable letter from P. d’Entrecolles, dated 1712, supplemented ten years later by further details. The difficulty incident to translating technical Chinese expressions, combined with want of acquaintance with chemistry on the part of the author, as well as the primitive condition of that science more than one hundred and fifty years ago, prevented the practical use of the information supplied by P. d’Entrecolles. An attempt was made to secure the knowledge desired by obtaining specimens of the materials employed. The fact, however, that these were sent either in a partially fused state or in the forms of several almost impalpable powders mixed together prevented a recognition of their real nature.
What it had been impossible to learn by direct inquiry was, however, discovered by chance. In 1718 Bottger found an important bed of white and plastic clay in Saxony, and with it made the first ‘‘ hard” porcelain manufactured in Europe. The government had this bed carefully guarded, imposed oaths of secrecy upon the staff employed, had a strict account kept of all the clay taken out, and transported it under armed convoy to Albrechtsburg, the place of manufacture, which was converted into a veritable fortress. In spite, however, of these precautions the secret leaked out in course of time, and with it the clay also, to Vienna and St. Petersburg. Later, in 1765, Guettard discovered in France the kaolin of Alengon, and Macquer, three years later, found the remarkable beds of Saint-Yrieix.
The History of the Porcelain manufactories at Chingté-chén, translated by M. Julien, containing as it does a detailed account of the procedure followed there, permits a comparison between the systems employed in China and in Europe. In view of the interest attaching to such a comparison no apology is needed for the following brief notes on that subject, based chiefly upon the preface to M. Julien’s work from the pen of M. Salvetat, a member of the directory of the government manufactory at Sévres:
Porcelain is composed of two parts—the one, infusible, the paste (pate), which is required to supply the body of the vessel, or, as the

<<<Page: 540>>>

Chinese term it, to give it ‘‘bone;” the other, fusible, the glaze (g/a¢ure, couverte), which imparts its characteristic transparency to porcelain and at the same time prevents the vessel retaining its porousness or contracting under the influence of heat.
The principal ingredients of the paste are clays, which are classed according to their greater or less degree at the same time of plasticity and fusibility. The porcelain clay par excellence is kaolin, a white aluminum silicate produced by the decomposition of granitic or feldspathic rocks, almost infusible, and if not always perfectly white by nature, losing its tint in the kiln. It derives its name originally from that of the hill whence the manufactories at Chingté-chén procured their supply of this clay. The main object of the glaze is, as has been said, while securing transparency, to prevent the paste remaining porous. Now, the substances unaffected by water but fusible by fire are quartz, silica, certain limestones, pegmatite, feldspar, silex, and the compounds resulting from a superficial fusion of these substances, which are then reduced to a fine powder. The relative proportion of these substances in the composition of the glaze may be raised at will with a corresponding diversity of result—M. Brogniart dividing the compound into three classes, each subdivided into three groups.
Inordinary language porcelain is classified under two grand divisions, hard paste and soft paste—/a pate dure and la pate tendre. The latter is characterized by the presence, either naturally or artificially ,of limestone products or alkalies, either in the condition of phosphates or in that of marl or chalk,which lower its degree of fusibility, so that it becomes fusible or at least soft at a temperature of 800° C. The absence of these matters in the hard paste causes it to retain its original consistency in far greater heat, and it can resist a temperature of 1,500° C., or above. Upon these two divisions are grafted several minor ones determined by the kind of glaze, which, according to its composition and mode of application, is termed wernis, émail, or couverte. After unglazed tiles and bricks, the primitive thin glaze, vernzs, is found on the pottery of the Etruscans, ancient Arabs, Persians, and the early inhabitants of America; then, on that manufactured in Germany and Italy in the fourteenth century, a sort of transparent glass with a foundation of lead—a glaze still common in country productions. Later, in the fifteenth century, the true white enamel, émaz/, a mixture of salt, of lead and tin, the thickness of which concealed the color of the paste, was discovered in Italy and gained immortality for Luca della Robbia, of Florence, and Oragio Fontana, of Pesaro. In this category also belong the majolicas, faenza, the faiences of Niirnberg, Bernard Palissy’s pottery, the faiences of Nevers, Rouen, and other places, ancient and modern. The cowerte is confined to porcelain proper.
Crude Chinese kaolin, when cleansed by washing out its impurities, and ready for use in making the paste, gives a very white clay, soft to

<<<Page: 541>>>

the touch, possessing a plasticity very similar to that of Saint Yrieix, which is derived from decomposed pegmatite. The residue left by the washing contains a good deal of quartz, crystals of feldspar partially decomposed, and flakes of mica, as would be found in graphic granite. Analysis shows that the fusible portion consists chiefly of petrosilex and, by its composition and density, closely resembles the rock found in abundance at Saint Yrieix, which, without addition, furnishes the glaze for hard porcelain at Sévres.
The composition of Chinese and of the most celebreted of European porcelains may be compared in the following table:

Thus, generally speaking, Chinese porcelain contains more silica and less alumina than do the products of the manufactories of Sévres, Vienna, and Saxony, respectively. The effect of the presence in greater or less degree of these components is well known by the Chinese, who say that to produce fine porcelain the ratio of alumina must be increased; to produce the commoner kinds that of silica must be increased. In Europe experience has taught the same results. The porcelain of commerce shows much the same composition as do the specimens of Chinese analyzed by M. Salvetat, also presumably ordinary ware and not the finest grades intended for imperial use, while in the three government establishments mentioned a larger ratio of alumina is introduced, because it resists high temperatures and is therefore necessary to enable the designs painted to maintain their sharpness of outline. In some cases the Chinese also employ ferruginous kaolins, which sensibly diminish the value of the manufactured article.
In China the paste is roughly shaped, is turned, and is moulded when in a malleable state, in much the same manner as in Europe. Casting or moulage en barbotine appears to be unknown in China. The absence of this process, which has enabled European artists to produce such grand results, only increases our admiration of the manual dexterity which has enabled the Chinese to manufacture such numbers of jars of large dimensions and cups so thin as egg-shell porcelain, which can

<<<Page: 542>>>

now, or could at least when M. Salvetat wrote, only be produced at Sévres by casting. The sculpture, the hollowing out, the shaping, etc.. are practiced also in China in much the same manner as in Europe. Among the happiest effects produced in this line are engraving in the paste, sculpture in relief on the paste, and the open work which the French term pieces réticulées.
One peculiarity of the Chinese system is the method of completing the foot in the unbaked state and after being covered with glaze. This custom of laying on the glaze before the article has been completed, the method in which the glaze is applied, and the composition of the glaze present, perhaps, the greatest contrasts with the corresponding manipulations employed in Europe. It is certainly curious that the Chinese after a practical experience extending through so many centuries should be ignorant of the advantages to be derived from submitting the article to a slight baking before applying the glaze, which is then in a condition termed by the French (état dégourd?. Porcelain earth, like other clays, is dilutable by water, but it ceases to be so after exposure to a temperature which makes it red. On this property is based, in Europe, an expeditious and easy method of covering porcelain with glaze. The porcelain having been rendered indissoluble and absorbent by a preliminary slight baking, it may be covered with a uniform layer of suitable thickness by a simple immersion in water holding the finely crushed material in suspension, provided that the proportions of water and glaze (relatively to the thickness of the vessel to be covered) have been duly determined. The failure to employ this process is the more curious since, from Mr. Hoffman’s sketch of the Japanese system of manufacture appended to M. Julien’s work, it appears that in that country the glaze is applied to porcelain after preliminary baking.
In Europe porcelain glaze is generally composed of pure pegmatite, finely crushed and applied by immersion after a preliminary baking. In Germany other substances, such as kaolin or paste, have been added to diminish its fusibility, but at Sévres pegmatite from Saint Yrieix is alone used. The addition of lime in forming the glaze is a rare exception in Europe. In China, on the contrary, pure petrosilix is but very seldom used for this purpose. The greater part of Chinese and Japanese porcelains is covered with compound glazes, obtained by a mixture of substances of which the proportions vary according to the nature of the article, lime being the material added to the petrosilix to render it more easily fusible; and, in some cases, the ratio added is so large that it represents a fourth of the total weight. In the preparation of the glaze, the use of fern leaves is sometimes mentioned. The residue of the leaves after burning appears, however, to be cast aside, and what purpose these leaves exactly served has never been determined,

<<<Page: 543>>>

As regards the manner of applying the glaze the Chinese, as has been shown, are ignorant of the method of subjecting the porcelain to a preliminary baking and then utilizing the want of porousness thus gained to immerse the vessel in the liquid glaze. Instead, they apply it by aspersion and immersion or by insufflation. For example, take acup. It is held by the outside slanting over a basin containing the liquid glaze. Suflicient of the glaze is then thrown on the inside to cover the surface. This is aspersion. The outside is then immersed in the liquid, the workman dexterously keeping the vessel in equilibrium with the hand and a small stick. The foot having remained in its original state, the cup is then carried, covered as it is with glaze, to the wheel that the foot may be hollowed and finished; a mark in color is added on the hollowed portion, which is then covered with glaze. When the ware is too delicate to be treated in this manner, the glaze is applied by insufflation. A piece of gauze attached to a hollow tube having been plunged in the colored glaze (red or blue) or uncolored glaze, the workman scatters the liquid from the gauze on to the vessel by blowing through the opposite end of the tube three, four, or even as many as eighteen times.
The porcelain being then ready for baking, it is taken to the kilns, which are usually situated at some distance from the workshops and belong to persons whose sole occupation is to superintend the baking. The large pieces are placed one by one in a separate seggar made by hand, covers being dispensed with by piling the seggars one on another. Several of the smaller pieces are placed in the same seggar, the floor under each being covered with a layer of sand and kaolin refuse to preventadhesion. The porcelain being still in a soft state, great care must be exercised in placing it in its seggar. It is not touched, therefore, with the hand, but transferred into the seggar by an ingenious contrivance of cords and sticks. The bottom of the kiln is filled with a thick layer of gravel on which the seggars are piled, those under the chimney, the two seggars at the bottom of each pile, and that at the top being left empty, as their contents would not be thoroughly baked. The finest pieces are placed in the center, those with harder glaze at the entry near the hearth, and the coarsest farthest in. The piles are strongly bound together, and, the stacking of the oven being completed, the door is bricked up. From the description given of the kilns by P. d’Entrecolles it appears that they are much the same as those used in early times at Vienna and Berlin.
After the baking begins a low fire is kept up for twenty-four hours, which is then followed by one more powerful. At the top of the kiln’ are four or five small holes covered with broken pots, one of which is opened when it is thought the baking is completed, and by means of

<<<Page: 544>>>

pincers a cage is opened to test the condition of the porcelain. The baking ended, firing is stopped and all openings closed during a period of three or five days, according to the size of the pieces, when the door is opened and the articles removed.
To bake porcelain decorated with soft colors or du demi-grand feu two kinds of kilns are used—one open, the other closed—the former of which bears a close resemblance to the enameler’s kiln (moujle). This kind of furnace has been used in Germany to bake painted porcelain; but even in China the liability to breakage confines its use to articles of small size. The large pieces are baked in closed kilns, the general arrangement of which resembles that of the kilns known as moufles, but being circular in form, they are really percelain kilns of small size.
In the decoration of European porcelain one of three methods is followed: (a) The use of paste of different colors; (4) the introduction of the coloring matter in the glaze; (c) the application of the colors upon the white surface of the porcelain. The two former methods require the application of a temperature as high as that necessary to bake the porcelain; they are therefore termed colors du grand feu. The third method requires for the vitrifaction of the colors a much lower temperature; the colors used are therefore termed de moufle, or of the enameler’s furnace. It is the use of this latter system which permits the reproduction with exactness of the works of celebrated oil painters.
The substances employed in the decoration of porcelain in China may be divided into two similar categories, colors dw grand feu and de moufle.
Colors du grand feu.—TVhe varieties of the grounds in these colors have played probably as important a part in the high reputation gained by Chinese porcelain as have the originality and rich harmony of the designs. The //ve decoration under the glaze is made with the brush on the unbaked porcelain, the coloring matter being peroxide of cobaltiferous manganese, the shade, dark or light, depending on the quantity used, and the greater or less trending toward violet on the richness of the ore in cobalt. It resists the fire well, retaining great distinctness and at lower temperatures than are necessary at Sevres. Celadon and the red grounds, at times showing an orange, at othersa violet shade, had not beensuccessfully reproduced in Europe when M. Salvetat wrote in 1855, and he considered their production in China as due rather to accident than design. The justice of this view is, however, perhaps open to question, for the Chinese appear to have at least an empirical knowledge of the conditions necessary to produce these colors, though they are unable in all cases to ensure those conditions. The fond laque or feuille morte is obtained by the use of oxide

<<<Page: 545>>>

of iron, the amount of that metal and the nature of the gas surrounding the vessel in the kiln determining the tone of the color from a light shade to one resembling bronze, and warmth of color being obtained by an oxidizing atmosphere. /ack grounds are produced in a variety of ways, either by the thickness of the colored glaze, or by laying several shades of different colors one on the other, or, again, by laying a blue glaze on a brown laque, or vice versa.
M. Salvetat writes that among the colors for the ground employed in China some are evidently applied upon the biscuit; that is, porcelain already fired at a high temperature. These are wiolet, turquoise blue, yellow, and green, all containing a pretty large proportion of ‘oxide of lead; and, vitrifying as they do at a medium temperature, hold a place half way between the two main categories and may be therefore termed colors du demi-grand feu. Nothing approaching these colors, he says, is produced in Europe. To do so, however, would not be difficult, the green and turquoise blue owing their colors to copper, the yellow to lead and antimony, and the violet to an oxide of manganese containing but little cobalt.
Colors de moufle.—In Europe these colors are obtained by mixing one oxide or several metallic oxides together with a vitreous flux, the composition of which varies with the nature of the color to be developed. That most generally used is termed ‘‘ the flux for grays.” It serves not only for grays, however, but also for blacks, reds, blues, and yellows, and is composed of six parts of minium, two parts of silicious sand, and one part of melted borax. The colors are obtained by mixing by weight one part of metallic oxide with three parts of the flux, so that the composition may be expressed thus:
Silicay: S40 eee Aone creel ae Te ne 16.7 Oxide of lead22th. 222 So Se ae ene eee 50. 0 Borax: 25 2f) SSSI) 2 oe ee er oe eee yen ep 8.3 Coloring’ oxidés=2*2 8 ae os ee eee ee ae 25. 0
100. 0
In cases where, as with oxide of cobalt, the colors are produced by mixture with the flux and ought to have the required shade when applied, the metallic oxides are melted with the flux prior to use; in those, however, where the desired color is that inherent in the oxide, the tone of which would be changed by a double exposure to fire, as is the case with reds derived from iron peroxide, the union with the flux by melting is dispensed with. The colors so made suffice to permit the reproduction on porcelain of oil paintings; but it is essential that they all melt at the same temperature and after baking present a suflicient and thoroughly uniform glaze.
In Chinese decorations these conditions, insisted upon in Europe, are both absent. Some colors, such as the rose tints derived from gold, the blues, greens, and yellows, are brilliant, thoroughly melted, and so

<<<Page: 546>>>

thick as to stand out above the general level of the surface; others, such as the reds derived from iron and the blacks, are much thinner, and are almost always quite dull or only slightly glazed when thin. The style of painting in Chinese differs entirely from the European. In the majority of the specimens the forms and flesh are not modeled; strokes of black or red define the outlines; the tones do not shade; the colors are laid in flat tints on which a damask is sometimes drawn afterwards, either in the same or in different colors, but the mixture on the palette of different crushed colors, which permits of somuch variety in European painting, appears not to be practiced by them. Their colors (as indeed seemed probable from the lightness of the shades obtained, in spite of their thickness before analysis had contirmed the presumption) contained far less coloring matter than do the European, a peculiarity which makes them approach nearer to the vitrified substances known as enamel than to any other. They are characterized by great simplicity and a considerable degree of uniformity.
The flux, which is not distinct in color, isalways composed of silica, of oxide of lead in but shghtly varying proportions, and of a larger or smaller quantity of alkaHes (soda and potash). This flux contains in dissolution, in the conditions of silicates, some hundredths parts only of coloring oxides. The number of these is very small, being oxide of copper for greens and bluish-greens, gold for the reds, oxide of cobalt for the blues, oxide:of antimony for the yellows, and arsenical acid and stannic acid for whites. Oxides of iron to produce red and oxides of impure manganese to produce black are not used, because no doubt these colors can not be obtained from the oxides named by means of dissolution.
In Europe, in addition to the oxides already mentioned, important results are obtained from substances unknown in China. The shade derived from pure oxide of cobalt is modified by mixing with it oxide of zinc or alumina, and sometimes alumina and oxide of chromium; pure oxide of iron gives a dozen reds, shading from orange-red to very dark violet; ochers, pale or dark, yellow or brown, are obtained by the combination in different proportions of oxide of iron, of oxide of zine, and of oxide of cobalt or nickel; browns are produced by increasing the amount of oxide of cobalt contained in, and blacks by omitting the oxide of zine from, the composition which gives the ochers. The shades of yellow are varied by the addition of oxide of zine or of tin to render them lighter, and of oxide of iron to render them darker. Oxide of chromium, pure or mixed with oxide of cobalt or with oxides of cobalt and of zinc, gives yellow-greens and bluish-greens, which may be made to vary from pure green to almost pure blue. Metallic gold supplies the purple of Cassius, which may be changed at will into violet, purple, or carmine. Other useful colors are obtained from oxide of uranium and from chromate of iron, of barium, and of cadmium.
In European colors all these coloring matters are merely mixed. In

<<<Page: 547>>>

the Chinese the oxides are, on the contrary, dissolved. This peculiarity, no less than their appearance, closely connects the Chinese colors with ‘‘enamels.” Both present the same coloring, obtained from the same oxides and a composition of flux very similar, sometimes identical. Transparent enamels are vitreous compounds, the composition of which varies, according to the amount of fusibility required, and which are colored by a few hundredths of oxides. Blues are supplied by oxide of cobalt, greens by protoxide of copper, reds by gold. Opaque enamels, yellow or white, owe their color and opacity either to antimony or to arsenic or stannic acids, together or alone. It had, however, been found impossible to utilize these enamel substances in the decoration of European porcelain, owing to the fact that they scaled off; and when the Chinese colors (as sent by MM. Itier and Ly) were experimented upon at Sévres, they did precisely the same thing. When placed upon Chinese porcelain, however, they developed at a temperature below that used at the Sévres manufactory for retouching flowers, and did not scale. The explanation is no doubt to be found in the fact that the paste of Chinese porcelain being more fusible than the European, the glaze must also be more easily fusible, and the lime introduced into it to increase the fusibility adapts it in some manner for closer union with the compounds forming the enamel.
If, then, the appearance of Chinese porcelain differs from that of European productions, if the harmony of their paintings offers greater variety, it is the necessary result of the process employed in China. All the colors used contain but little coloring matter and have no worth unless applied in a depth which gives their paintings a relief impossible to obtain by other means. The harmony of their decoration results from the nature and composition of their enamels.

of white Chtnchow porcelain (Chiin-yao) of Yiian dynasty (A. D. 1260 to 1349), covered with glaze of duck’s-egg blue, of lighter tint at edge and brim, from which glaze has run, with large irregular splotches of claret red, shading into purple at edges, where it mixes with .blue color of the body. Diameter, 7? inches.
lish of white porcelain with openwork edge formed by intersecting circles; decoration inside, six medallions, of dragons’ féng huang, and formal designs joined by conventional foliage; outside a light pattern in blue. Mark on foot, Ta-ming-yung-lo-nien-chih, ‘‘Made during the Yunglo period (1403 to 1424) of the Ming dynasty;’’ style of decoration and of writing in the datemark shows it, however, to be of Japanese manufacture. Diameter, 92 inches.
The dung or dragon is the chief of the four Chinese supernatural beasts, the other three being the féng huang (usually translated phoenix), the ch‘ilin (usually translated unicorn), and the tortoise. It is usually represented with scowling head, straight horns, a scaly, serpentine body with four feet armed with formidable claws; along the length of the body runs a line of bristling dorsal spines, and on the hips and shoulders are flame-like appendages. The claws appear to have originally numbered three on each foot, but the number has in subsequent ages been increased to five. The Shuo-wén, a dictionary published in the second century A. D., states that of the three hundred and sixty scaly reptiles the’dragon is the chief. It wields the power of transformation and the gift of rendering itself visible or invisible at pleasure. In spring it ascends to the skies and in autumn it buries itself in the watery depths. The watery principle in the atmosphere is essentially associated with the Jung, but its congener, the chiao-lung, is inseparably connected with waters gathered upon the surface of the earth. A denizen of such waters is also the variety p‘an-lung, which does not mount to heaven. There is also a species of hornless dragon—the chin-lung. Kuan Tz’u (seventh century B. C.) declares that ‘‘the dragon becomes at will reduced to the size of a silkworm or swollen till it fills the space of heaven and earth. It desires to mount, and it rises till it affronts the clouds; to sink, and it descends till hidden below the fountains of the deep.’? The early cosmogonists enlarged upon the imaginary data of previous writers, and averred that there were four distinct kinds of dragons proper—the t‘ien-lung or celestial dragon, which guards the mansions of the gods and supports them so that they do not fall; the shén-lung or spiritual dragon, which causes the winds to blow and produces rain for the benefit of mankind; the ti-lung or dragon of earth, which marks out the courses of rivers and streams; and the fu-ts‘ang-lung or dragon of hidden treasures,

<<<Page: 549>>>

which watches over the wealth concealed from mortals. Modern superstition has further originated the idea of four dragon kings, each bearing rule over one of the four seas which form the borders of the habitable earth. The huang-lung or yellow dragon is the most honored of the tribe; and this it was, which, rising from the waters of Lo, presented to the eyes of Fuhsi the elements of writing (see No. 36). The dragon, as chief among the beings divinely constituted, is peculiarly symbolical of all that pertains to the Son of Heayen—the Emperor, whose throne is termed lung-wei, the dragon seat, and whose face is described as lung-yen, the dragon countenance (see Mayer’s Chinese Readers’ Manual No.451). At his death the Emperoris believed to be borne by dragons to the regions of the blessed. The dragon thus intimately associated with the Emperor is always depicted with five talons on each claw, and it is he alone, properly speaking, who can use such a device upon his property; the dragon borne by the princes of the blood has but four talons on each claw. The distinction, however, is not at present rigidly maintained, and the five-clawed dragon is met with embroidered on officers’ uniforms.
‘‘In Chinese Buddhism,’ says Dr. Anderson, in his Catalogue of Japan-
ese and Chinese Paintings in the British Museum, ‘‘the dragon plays an important part, either as a force auxiliary to the law, or as a malevolent creature to be converted or quelled. Its usual character, however, is that of a guardian of the faith under the direction of Buddhas, Bédhisattvas, or Arhats. As a dragon king it officiates at the baptism of S’Akyamuni, or bewails his entrance into Nirvana; as an attribute of saintly or divine personages it appears at the feet of the Arhat Panthaka, emerging from the sea to salute the goddess Kuanyin, or as an attendant upon or alternative form of Sarasyati, the Japanese Benten; as an enemy to mankind it meets its Perseus and St. George in the Chinese monarch Kao Tsu (of the Han dynasty) and the Shinto God, Susand no Mikoto. * * * As to the origin of the relation of the cobra to Indian Buddhism, there appears to be little doubt that the Cobra kings represented a once hostile Scythic race of serpent-worshipers which first invaded India in the seventh century B. C., and that a subsequent alliance with portions of the foreign tribes gave rise to the stories of converted Nagas and 0’ Nagas who defended the faith. When the religion made its way into China, where the hooded snake was unknown, the emblems shown in the Indian pictures and graven images lost their force of suggestion, and hence became replaced by a mythical but more familiar emblem of power. The multiplication of the cobra head seen in the Amrayati topes becomes lost in Chinese Buddhism, but perhaps may be traced in the seven-headed dragons and serpents of Japanese legend. The high position occupied by the dragon in Chinese imagination may perhaps be a relic of ancient serpent worship in that country. Illustrations of the identity of the dragon and serpent in Japanese art and the portrayal of creatures in transitional forms between the two are suggestive of such an origin.”’
Feng, the name of the male, and huang, of the female, of a fabulous bird
of wondrous form and mystic nature, the second among the four — supernatural creatures. The compound of the two, féng-huang, is the generic designation usually employed for the bird, and is frequently

<<<Page: 550>>>

translated ‘‘phcenix.’’ One writer describes it as having the head of a pheasant, the beak of a swallow, the neck of a tortoise, and the outward semblance of a dragon, to which another version adds the tail of a fish, but in pictorial representations it is usually delineated, as here, as a compound of a peacock and a pheasant, with the addition of many gorgeous colors. Very early legends narrated that this bird made its appearance as a presage of the advent of virtuous rulers, whose presence it also graced as an emblem of their auspicious government. It sat in the court of Huang Ti, who is credited with having entered upon a reign of one hundred years in B. C. 2697, while that sovereign observed thé ceremonial fasts; and, according to the Classic of History, it came with measured gambolings to add splendor to the musical performances conducted by the great Shun (B. C. 2255 to 2206). The five colors of its plumage are supposed to be typical of the five cardinal virtues. As the dung or dragon has become the emblem of the Emperor, so the féng-huang has become that of the Empress.
5-8. Tea-cups (4), with everted rim, of pure white, thin Hstianté (1426 to 1435) porce-
lain, with very delicate flower pattern, from which the paste has been excised and replaced by thin film of glaze to render it capable of holding liquid. Beautiful specimens of this style of decoration generally known in English as ‘‘lace-work’’—the pieces réticulées of the French. Mark on foot Ta-minghsitan-té-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Hsiianté period of the Ming dynasty.”’
9. Small fish-bowl of Hsiianté white porcelain, with ornamentation of mang or
unhorned dragons with pointed head among very conventional clouds, and geometrical pattern above running round brim, all incised in paste below a palegreen or céladon glaze. Mark on foot Ta-ming-hsiian-té-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Hsiianté period of the Mingdynasty.’”’ Height, 63 inches; diameter, 8 inches. The mang would appear to be properly a huge serpent or boa constrictor. In paintings, however, and in sculpture it is usually represented as a lizard having a scowling head, with a beard at times depending from the chin, and four feet bearing claws but without talons. On the mang-p’ao, 7. e., mang robe, the court dress, no mang, properly speaking, appears, its place being taken by a four clawed or taloned dragon.
10. Tall vase, in shape of bag, with long neck bound around with a ribbon tied in
bow, of Ch’énghua (1465 to 1487) white porcelain covered with a yellowblack glaze. Height, 13} inches; diameter, 72 inches.
11 Slender vase of pure white Ch’énghua porcelain; decoration, immortals or genii
engaged in literary contests and attended by servants in rocky valley, with bamboo thickets painted in bright blue under glaze. Mark Ta-ming-ch’ énghua-nien-chih, ‘‘Made during the Ch’énghua period of the Ming dynasty.” Height, 10} inches.
134, Pencil-holder, circular in shape and very broad, of white Ch’énghua porcelain;
decoration, which is in beautiful shade of blue under transparent glaze—a long poem from the pen of the celebrated poet Li Tai-po, of the Sung dynasty, inculcating the epicurean philosophy, which may be summed up in Horace’s words, Carpe diem, quam minime credula postero. The advice contained in the poem is being put into practice by a merry party round the festive board, whose actions seem to express the words of the Latin author, Fruamur bonis que sunt; pretioso vino et unguentis nos impleamus, non pretereat nos flos temporis. Nomark. Height, 6 inches; diameter, 6{ inches.

<<<Page: 551>>>

12. Small bowl to hold flowers or water for use on ink slab, of white Ch’éngté (1506 to 1521) porcelain, covered outside with milky blue glaze, inside plain, coarsely crackled inside and out. Mark Ta-ming-chéng-té-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Ch’éngté period of the Great Ming dynasty.’’ Height, 2? inches; diameter, 43 inches.
13. Jar, of potiche shape, of Wanli (1573 to 1619) white porcelain; decoration, flying Jéng huang and dragons (see No. 4), with flowers between, and above a border of formal pattern, resembling inverted spearheads; cover has small pattern running round it with dragon on top; ornamentation throughout is engraved in paste and of bright yellow upon a vivid green ground. Mark Tu-mingwan-li-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the Wanli period of the Great Ming dynasty.”’ Height, 63 inches; diameter, 6$ inches.
14, 15. Bowls (2), with scalloped brim, of white porcelain decorated with red and gold plum-blossoms, alternating with gourd-shaped vases having a decoration in gold ona blue ground or formal flowers, resembling pinks and chrysanthemums in white, red, and gold, or all gold, upon a salmon-colored ground, with long twisted ribbons attached, the decoration passing from outside over the brim to inside, where at bottom, confined by a double circle, is a blue dragon in white, green, and red clouds. Round foot on outside is small pattern. Marked as last, but decoration and calligraphy of date mark show the ware to be of Japanese manufacture. Height, 3} inches; diameter, 7% inches.
16,17. Jars (2), circular in shape, the walls rising perpendicularly, of Ming dynasty porcelain, decorated with iris and leaves boldly outlined in relief and covered with thick glazes of different colors, the flowers being yellow and the leaves peacock-green upon a deep aubergine ground; brim green, with a formal panel pattern outlined in relief round neck and colored alternately with same deep glaze (yellow and peacock-green), inside thin peacock-green glaze. Good specimen of this highly-prized ware. No mark. Height, 6} inches; diameter, 63 inches.
18. Jar of white porcelain of Ming dynasty, of either Hstianté (1426 to 14385) or Ch’énghua (1465 to 1487) period. Decoration, Pei-tow (the Northern Pole star) and Nan-tow (the Southern Pole star) playing chess on mountain road, with boy bearing a bundle of dry branchlets, and an inscription in seal character, ‘‘Among the hills a thousand years seem but as seven days.”’ Landscape and figures in beautiful deep blue under glaze and in pale and dark green enamel colors. Above, a formal pattern encircles the jar below the neck, round which aresmall sprays of flowers in brick-red with leaves alternately green and blue.
This represents the well-known legend of Wang Chih, who, having wandered in the mountains of Ch’ iichow to gather fire-wood, came upon two aged men, the Southern Pole star, the genius of longevity, and the Northern Pole star, the genius of death, intent upon a game of chess. He laid down his ax and watched their game, in the course of which the former handed him something resembling a date-stone, which he was told to place in his mouth. No sooner had he tasted it than he became oblivious of hunger and thirst. After some time the donor turned to him and said, ‘‘It is long since you came here; you should go home now.”’ Whereupon Wang Chih, proceeding to_ pick up his ax, found that the handle had moldered into dust. On reaching his home he found that centuries had elapsed since the time when he left it for the mountains, and that no vestige of his kinsfolk remained. Retiring toa retreat among the hills he devoted

<<<Page: 552>>>

himself to the rites of Taoism, and finally attained to immortality.! Wang Chih is stated to have lived under the Chin dynasty in the third century B. C. The appearance of this South Pole star is supposed to announce peace throughout the world.
19, 20. Jars (2) with covers, of the small potiche shape, of pure white porcelain, with paintings in deep, dull blue under glaze, of children playing in garden and plucking flowers from the trees; cover ornamented with children, similarly painted, in grotesque attitudes playing. A reproduction of a popular Chinese painting, the Po-tzt-t’u, ‘‘ Drawing of (/if. a hundred) Children.’? Mark on foot, a leaf, which makes these specimens date from the K’anghsi period (1662 to 1722), though the color is rather that of the Ming dynasty. Height, 10 inches.
21. Wine-pot of creamy white Ming dynasty Chienning porcelain ( Chien-yao), termed by the French blane de Chine. Tall, circular in shape, tied at center with ribbon. Spout formed by lizard with four legs and branching tail, which clings to rim and turns head outward, the wine issuing from its mouth. The handle is formed by a similar animal twisting head downward from rim to center of vessel. Has closely-fitting cover, surmounted by a knob formed of a diminutive lizard curled into the form of a ball. No mark on foot. Height, 93 inches; diameter, 33 inches.
22-24. Seals (3) of creamy white Ming dynasty Chienning porcelain (blane de Chine), one large and two smaller, cubes in shape, each surmounted by a lion as handle boldly molded in relief, with long, straight mane and tail, and curly hairdown back. Nos. 22 and 24 represent a lioness with one cub. No mark. Height, Nos. 22 and 23, 2? inches; No. 24, 3 inches; diameter, Nos. 22 and 23, 18 inches; No. 24, 12 inches.
25. Pencil-holder, tall, circular in shape, of pure-white Ming dynasty porcelain, formed of sprays of lotus flowers and leaves admirably molded in relief and covered with lustrous, transparent glaze, the spaces between the flowers and leaves being excised to form open-work. No mark; bottom unglazed. Height, 3? inches; diameter, 24 inches.
171. Pencil-washer of white Ming porcelain, of globular form, with low, open neck, and a handle on either side formed of a grotesque lion’s head molded in relief. Decoration consists of six genii riding on a sword, a carp, a tiger, a hat, a bunch of sticks, and a dragon, painted in a deep blue through brick-red waves under glaze. Round neck and foot a narrow band of white studded with bluespots. Mark 7s’ ai-hua-t’ ang, the designation of a portion of some princely palace not yet identified. Height, 23 inches; diameter, 3} inches.
The sage riding the waves upon the sword is Lii Fung-pin, stated to have been born A. D. 755. While holding office as magistrate of Té-hua, in modern Kiangsi, he is said to have met the immortalized Chung-li Ch’tian, who instructed him in the mysteries of alchemy. On his subsequently begging to be allowed to convert his fellowcountrymen to the true belief, he was, as a preliminary, exposed to ten temptations, which he successfully resisted. He was then invested with the formulas of magic and a sword of supernatural power, as the Taoist legends relate, with which he traversed the Empire during a period of four hundred years, killing dragons and ridding it of divers kinds of evils. In the twelfth century temples were erected to his honor under the title of Ch‘un Yang. (Mayers, No. 467.)
‘Mayers, Chinese Reader’s Manual, No. 794.

<<<Page: 553>>>

He of the carp is Kin-Kao, ‘‘a sage who lived in northern China about
the twelfth century. It it said that he wandered over the province of Chihli for two centuries, and then, taking leave of his disciples with a promise to return by a certain day, he plunged into the river. When the appointed time for his reappearance arrived, the pupils, with a great multitude, assembled upon the banks, and, having duly bathed and purified themselves, made offerings to him. At length, in the sight of ten thousand persons, he sprang from the water riding upon a carp. After tarrying with his friends for a month he again entered the river and was seen no more.’’!
The sage on the tiger is perhaps Chti Ling-jen, a rishi of marvelous
powers.
He on the bundle of sticks is perhaps Damma, son of a king in southern
India, ‘‘who,’’ says Mr. Anderson in his catalogue, p. 511, ‘‘was the first Chinese patriarch. Hearrived in China A.D. 520,and established himself in a temple in Loyang. During nine years of his stay there he remained buried in profound abstraction, neither moving nor speaking, and when he returned to consciousness of his surroundings his legs had become paralyzed by long disuse. In the Butsu-zo-dzu-i it is said he came to Japan A. D. 613, and died on Mount Kataoaka. The Chinese, however, maintain he died and was buried in China, but that three years after his death he was met traveling toward India, with one foot bare, and when his tomb was opened by the Emperor’s order it was found empty save for a cast-off shoe.”’
The dragon genius is Ch‘én Nan, a sage possessed of supernatural powers
to cure the sick, transmute metals, travel enormous distances, ete. Passing through a place where the inhabitants were praying for rain he stirred a pool where he knew a dragon lived, with a long iron pole. So plenteous a downpour at once ensued that all the rivers were filled.
172-175. Plates (4 small) of white Ming dynasty porcelain, decorated inside, the
genius of longevity accompanied by the spotted stag, amid waves and clouds in deep blue upon brick-red waves. On the outside are the eight immortals venerated by the Taoist sect, in blue on vermilion waves. Mark as on The decoration shows them to have been intended to hold sweetmeats during birthday ceremonies.
The eight immortals venerated by the Taoists are Chung-liCh ‘tian, Chang
Kuo, Lii Tung-pin, Ts‘ao Kuo-ch ‘iu, Li Tieh-kuai, Han Hsiang-tz‘u, Lan Ts‘ai-ho, and Ho Hsien-ku. Though some, if not all, of these personages had been previously venerated as immortals in Taoist legends, it would appear from the A ‘é-yii-ts‘ung-k‘ao (chap. 34) that their defined assemblage into a group of immortalized beings can not claim a higher antiquity than the Ytian dynasty—that is, the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century.
Chung-li Ch‘iian is reputed to have lived under the Chow dynasty (B. C.
1122 to 256). Many marvelous particulars are narrated respecting his birth and career, in the course of which he met Tung Hua Kung, the patriarch of the Genii, ‘‘ who revealed to him the mystic formula of longevity and the secret of the power of transmutation, and of magic craft.’? He was eventually permitted to join the Genii, and has appeared from time to time as the messenger of Heaven. He is usually represented as a martial figure with a sword.

Chang Kuo is said to have flourished toward the close of the seventh and middle of the eighth century. Leading an erratic life, he performed wonderful feats of necromancy. His constantcompanion was a white mule which could carry him thousands of miles in a single day, and which, when he halted, he folded up and hid away in his wallet. When heagain required its services, he spurted water upon the packet from his mouth and the animal at once resumed its proper shape. According to Taoist legend, the Emperor Hstian Tsung, of the T‘ang dynasty, repeatedly urged him to visit his court and assume a priestly office there, but the ascetic wanderer rejected every offer. He is reputed to have entered immortality about 740 A. D. without suffering bodily dissolution. He is usually represented conjuring his mule from a wallet or gourd, or holding an instrument of musie.
Lii Tung-pin said to have been born A. D. 755. While holding office at Té-hua, in modern Kiangsi province, he is reputed to have met Chung-li Ch‘tian (see ante) among the Lu Mountains, and was instructed by him in the mysteries of alchemy and the magic formula of the elixir of life. Having expressed a desire to convert his fellow-men to the true belief, a series of temptations, ten in number, was imposed upon him as a preliminary. These he successfully overcame, and was thereupon invested with the formulas of magic and a sword of supernatural power, with which he traversed the Empire during a period of four hundred years, slaying dragons and ridding it of various kinds of evils. In the twelfth century temples were erected to him under the title of Ch‘un Yang. Like Chung-li Ch‘uan, he is. usually depicted as of martial bearing, armed with a sword.
Of Ts‘ao Kuo-ch‘in little is known. He is reputed to have been the son of Ts‘ao-pin, the great military commander, who largely contributed to the establishment of the Sung dynasty upon the throne of China, and the brother of the Empress Ts‘ao of the same dynasty. He would thus have lived in the eleventh century. He is usually represented as a military officer, holding a pair of castanets.
Li T‘ieh-kuai, or T‘ieh-Kuai-Hsien-Shéng, i. e., ‘Li of the Iron Staff,’’ or ‘‘the gentleman of the Iron Staff.’’ His birth is assigned to no precise era; his name, however, is stated to have been Li, and he is described as of commanding stature and of dignified mien. He was entirely devoted to the study of Taoist lore, his instructor having been the philosopher Lao Tz‘u himself, who for that purpose descended at times from Heaven and at others summoned his pupil to his celestial abode. ‘‘On one occasion, when about to mount on high,”’ says the legend as given by Mayers (No. 718), ‘‘at his patron’s bidding the pupil, before departing in spirit to voyage through the air, left a disciple of his own to watch over his material soul (p‘o), with the command that if, after seven days had expired, his spirit (hun) did not return, the material essence might be dismissed into space. Unfortunately at the expiration of six days the watcher was called away to the deathbed of his mother, and, his trust being neglected, when the disembodied spirit returned on the evening of the seventh day it found its earthly habitation no longer vitalized. It therefore entered the first available refuge, which was the body of a lame and crooked beggar whose spirit had at that moment been exhaled, and in this shape the philosopher continued his existence, supporting his halting footsteps with an iron staff.”’ Li T4eh-kuai

<<<Page: 555>>>

is, in consequence, usually depicted as a lame and ragged beggar exhaling his spiritual essence in the form of a shadowy miniature of his corporeal form, or conjuring five bats, symbolical of the five kinds of happiness (see No. 27) from a gourd.
Han Hsiang-tz‘u is reputed to have been the grandson of the famous statesman, philosopher, and poet of the T‘ang dynasty, and to have lived in the latter half of the ninth century. He was an ardent votary of transcendental study, and the pupil of Lii Tung-pin (see ante), himself one of the immortals, who appeared to him in the flesh. Having been carried up into the peach tree of the Genii (see Nos. 27 and 28), he fell from its branches, and in falling entered into immortality. He is usually depicted playing upon a flute or sitting upon a portion of the trunk of a peach tree.
Lan Ts‘ai-ho is of uncertain sex, but usually reputed a female. The t‘ai-p‘ing-kuang-chi states that she wandered abroad clad in a tattered blue gown, with one foot shoeless and the other shod, in summer wearing a wadded garment next the skin and in winter sleeping amid snow and ice. ‘In this guise,”’ says Mayers, ‘‘the weird being begged a livelihood in the streets, waving a wand aloft and chanting a doggerel verse denunciatory of fleeting life and its delusive pleasures.’? Lan Ts‘ai-ho is usually drawn as an aged man or as a female clad in leaves or rags, carrying a basket (?) to hold the alms | given.
Ho Hsien-Ku was the daughter of one Ho Tai, a native of Tséng-ch‘éng, near Canton, and was born in the latter half of the seventh century. Born with six hairs growing on the top of her head, she at fourteen years of age dreamed that a spirit visited her and instructed her in the art of obtaining immortality by eating powdered mother-of-pearl. She complied with this injunction and vowed herself to a life of virginity. Her days were henceforth passed in solitary wanderings among the hills, among which she moved as on wings, to gather herbs, and eventually renounced all mortal food. Her fame having . reached the ears of the Empress Mu, a concubine endowed with a masterful intellect, who succeeded in usurping the sovereign power, and who, but for a revolution, would have deposed the dynasty of T‘ang, she was summoned to court, but vanished from mortal sight on her way thither. She is said to have been seen once more, in A. D. 750, floating upon a cloud at the temple of the Taoist immortal Ma-Ku, and again some years later near Canton. She is sonvetimes represented clothed in a mantle of mugwort leaves and holding a lotus flower.
26. Bowl of white K’anghsi (1662 to 1722) porcelain, with scalloped edges dividing the vessel into eight flattened sections, each filled with a scene admirably painted, chiefly in blue, but with small details in enamel green, on a ground inside and out of deep yellow under thick transparent glaze. These paintings are copies from celebrated pictures, drawn by a famous artist named Fei of the Yiian dynasty, 7. e., latter half of the twelfth or early in thirteenth century, illustrative of the pleasures of the Hsi-yiian or Western Park. At bottom inside, a man holding a jar, also in blue. An admirable specimen of a highly prized ware.

Ysbrant Ides, Ambassador from Peter the Great to the Emperor of China in 1692 (published in Harris’s Collection of Voyages), say: ‘‘The finest, richest, and most valuable china is not exported, at least very rarely, particularly a yellow ware, which is destined for the imperial use, and is prohibited to all other persons.”’
The HsiYiian was a park laid out by Yang Ti (A. D. 605 to 616), of the Sui dynasty. It was over 60 miles in circuit, and ‘‘exhausted the utmost degrees of splendor and beauty. When the foliage became decayed and fell, it was replaced upon the trees by leaves of silk. Here the imperial débauché was accustomed to ride on moonlit nights, accompanied by a cavaleade of thousands of the inmates of his seraglio.”’ (Mayers. )
27. Bowl of pure white K’anghsi porcelain, wide spreading, decorated on outside with mythological subjects admirably painted in great detail and with great delicacy of brush in the characteristic tones of the latter half of this reign, vermilion-red and enamel colors. Inside a branch of the peach tree, bearing one fruit and several leaves, in green, shaded and varied with darker tints of the same color, with the exception of two, which show a great variety of shades of decay, the veins alone remaining in parts; on the peach, which, as here, is usually pointed in China, is the character Shou (longevity) in the “seal”? style in gold. An almost unique specimen of the highest style of decoration during the period when the manufacture of porcelain had reached its highest point. (See Plate 1.)
This bowl from its decoration was undoubtedly intended for use in the palace on the occasion of an imperial birthday. The peach is one of the emblems of longevity, from a legend which traced them to the gardens of the fairy Hsi Wang-Mu, where they ripened but once in three thousand years, and conferred that term of life upon those who were fortunate enough to taste them. The legend runs thus: ‘‘In the first year of the period Yuan féng in the Hau dynasty (B.C. 110) the fairy Hsi Wang had descended from her mountain realm to visit the Emperor Wu Ti, bringing with her seven peaches. She ate two of the number, and upon the Emperor expressing a wish to preserve the seed, she told him that the tree from which they came bore once only in three thousand years, but each fruit conferred three centuries of life upon the eater. At that moment she perceived Tung-Fangso peeping at her through the window, and, pointing to him, said: ‘That child whom you see yonder has stolen three of my peaches and is now nine thousand years old.’’’?! The gum of the peach tree mixed with mulberry ash is used as an ¢livir vite by the Taoists.?
The decoration on the outside is an adaptation of the allegorical representation of the prayer for ‘‘ happiness, distinction, and longevity ”’ ( fu-lao-show), met with in Chinese paintings under many forms, but always with the same general characteristics. One of the immortals, the great sage Lao Tz’u, accompanied by attendants, the crane (Grus viridirostris Veillot), the stag, the hairy tortoise, all emblems of long life; another, Li T’ich-kuai, with attendants, evolving froma gourd contracted at the center, five bats, emblematic of the five blessings—longevity, riches, peacefulness and serenity, the love of virtue, and an end crowning the life—the Chinese characters for bat and happiness having the same pronunciation.

28-31. Plates (4) of white porcelain. Hsi Wang Mu, depicted as a beautiful female in the ancient Chinese dress, is represented accompanied by one of her attendant maidens holding a tray containing peaches and other articles, and hy the spotted stag, symbolical of longevity, very delicately painted in enamel colors. The rim is ornamented with a narrow band in yermilion red of detached flowers of the Chinese peony ( Pxonia moutan) and of butterflies. Mark Tua-Ming-ch’ eng-hua-nien-chih, ‘“Made during the Ch’énghua period (1465 to 1487) of the great Ming or Bright (dynasty) ;’’ the colors and style of painting, however, point rather to the K’anghsi period as that of their manufacture. Diameter, 6? inches.
Hsi Wang Mu, literally Royal Mother of the West, is the legendary queen of the Genii, who is supposed to haye dwelt in a palace in central Asia among the K’unlun Mountains, where she held court . with her fairy legions. Upon some slight allusions to this personage in earlier works the philosopher Lieh Tz’u, in the fifth century, B. C., based a fanciful and perhaps allegorical tale of the entertainment with which King Mu of the Chou dynasty was honored and enthralled by the fairy queen during his famous journeyings B. C. 985. In later ages the superstitious vagaries of the Emperor Wu Ti of the Hau dynasty gave rise to innumerable fables respecting the alleged visits paid to that monarch by Hsi Wang Mu and her fairy troop; and the imagination of the Taoist writers of the ensuing centuries was exercised in glowing descriptions of the magnificence of her mountain palace. Here, by the borders of the Lake of Gems, grows the peach tree of the Genii, whose fruit confers the gift of immortality, bestowed by the goddess upon the favored beings admitted to her presence, and hence she dispatches the azure-winged birds, Ch’ ing-niao, which serve, like Venus’s doves, as her attendants and messengers. In process of time a consort was found for her in the person of Tung Wang Kung, or King Lord of the East, whose name is designed in obvious imitation of her own, and who appears to owe many of his attributes to the Hindoo legends respecting India. By the time of the Sung dynasty (the tenth century, A. D.) a highly mystical doctrine respecting the pair, represented as the first created and creative results of the powers of nature in their primary process of development, was elaborated in the Kuwang-Chi. The more sober research of modern writers leads to the suggestion that Wang Mu was the name either of a region or of a sovereign in the ancient West.
32, 33. Bowls (a pair), everted, of thin white K’anghsi porcelain decorated with the eighteen Lohan or Arhats in groups, very delicately painted in vermilion. Mark as in No. 26. Height, 23 inches; diameter, 6 inches.
In his Handbook of Chinese Buddhism, Dr. Eitel says that the original meaning of Arhat (‘‘deserving’’ ) is overlooked by most Chinese commentators, who explain the term as though it were written Arihat, ‘‘destroyer of the enemy,’’ i.e., of the passions, and ‘‘not to be reborn,” i. e., exempt from transmigration. A third explanation, based on the original conception, is ‘‘deserving of worship.’”’ The Arhat is the perfected Arya, and can therefore only be attained by passing through the different degrees of saintship. It implies the possession of supernatural powers, and is to be succeeded either by 3uddhaship or by immediate entrance into Nirvana. In popular acceptation, however, it has a wider range, designating not only the perfected saint, but all the disciples of S’Akyamuni, and thus it includes not only the smaller circles of eighteen and five hundred disciples, but also the largest circle of one thousand two hundred.

The first Sdtra (that of forty-two sections) was translated into Chinese in the year A. D. 67, during the time of the Later or Eastern Han dynasty, whose capital was at Loyang in Honan province, by Kas’yapa Miatanga, a disciple of S’Akyamuni, who entered China with Han Ming-ti’s embassy on its return from Badakshan. By its means the Buddhist doctrines first became known in China. Such translations from the Sanskrit form the earliest and still continue to be the most important part of Chinese Buddhistic literature; but from the fifth century onward they have been supplemented by original compositions in the Chinese language from the pens of native adherents to that religion. During the first eight centuries of the existence of the Buddhistic religion in China the smallest circle of S’Akyamuni’s disciples comprised the same number as in India, sixteen, which was increased under the T’ang dynasty, in the ninth century, A. D., by the enrollment of two additional disciples to its present complement in China—eighteen.
34, 35. Bowls (2), everted, of thin white K’anghsi porcelain. Replicas of Nos. 32, 33, but of larger size. Mark, same asin No. 26. Diameter, 6? inches.
36. Wine-cup, tall, everted, of thin white K’anghsi porcelain; ornamentation: Between borders of Grecian pattern are diamond-shaped panels containing the pa-kua, in deep-blue under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 3 inches; diameter, 3$ inches.
The pa-kua, or eight diagrams, are the combinations which may be formed of three lines, whole or divided into two equal parts. They are said to have been developed by Fuh-hi, the legendary founder of Chinese polity, who is believed to have lived from B. C. 2852 to 2738 by aid of a plan or arrangement of figures revealed to him on the back of a ‘“*dragon-horse.’’ These eight figures, which can be traced back to the two primary forms representing the first development of the Yin and Yank (the primordial essences) from the Ultimate Principle, together with certain presumptive explanations attributed to Fuh-hi, were the basis, according to Chinese belief, of an ancient system of philosophy and divination during the centuries preceding the area of Wén Wang (twelfth century, B. C. ), but of which no records have been preserved beyond the traditional names of its schools. Wén Wang, the founder of the Chou dynasty, while undergoing imprison-ment (B. C. 1144) at the hands of the tyrant Shou, devoted himself to study of the diagrams, and appended to each of them a short explanatory text. These explanations, with certain amplifications by his son, Chou Kung, constitute the work known as the ‘ Book of Changes”’ of the Chou dynasty, which, with the commentary added by Confucius, forms the Yih Ching, the Canon of Changes, the most venerated of the Chinese classics. In this work, which serves as a basis for the philosophy of divination and geomancy, and is largely appealed to as containing not alone the elements of all metaphysical knowledge but also a clue to the secrets of nature and of being the entire system reposed upon these eight diagrams, aceaseless process of revolution is held to be at work, in the course of which the various elements or properties of nature indicated by the diagrams mutually extinguish and give birth to one another, thus producing the phenomena of nature.?
37. Vase of white K ‘anghsi porcelain, i1 the shape of a gourd contracted in the middle (hu-lu), having a vine trailing over it, from which hang large bunches of

grapes on which a squirrel is feeding, in various shades of blue under a trans parent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 4% inches.
This is a well-known Chinese motive. ‘‘The first picture of the squirrel and the vine’’ (says Anderson, catalogue of Japanese and Chinese paintings in the British Museum, No. 747) “appears to have been painted by Wing Yiian-chang, a famous artist of the Sung dynasty, A. D. 960 to 1259, and has been repeated by innumerable copies in China and Japan.”’
38, 39. Plates (a pair) of white K ‘anghsi porcelain, having a large-sized character in center, believed to be Thibetan, surrounded on the sides by three concentric lines of smaller characters of similar type; on outside are three similar lines of characters in deep blue under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Diameter, 5£ inches.
40,41. Bowls (a pair) of thin white K‘anghsi porcelain. Ornamentation on outside consists of a delicately-drawn band of waves on lower portion where bowl springs from foot, with the pa-kua or eight diagrams (see No. 36) above. Inside, within double circle, at bottom, the yin and yang, all in deep blue under transparent glaze. Mark, as above. Height, 2$ inches; diameter, 4% inches.
The circle represents the ultimate principle of ‘‘being,’’ which is divided by a curving line into two equal portions, the positive and negative essences, yang and yin, respectively. Yang, the more lightly-colored portion, corresponds to light, heaven, masculinity, etc.; yin, the more darkly colored, to darkness, earth, femininity, etc. To the introduction of these two essences are due all the phenomena of nature.
42, 43. Bowls (a pair), small, everted, of white K‘anghsi porcelain, plain inside.
Decorated on outside with iris, grasses, longevity fungus (ling chih, a species
of (?) polyporus), tea-roses, and other flowers delicately painted in enamel colors upon a brick-red or vermilion ground. Mark, K‘ang-hsi-yii-chih, ‘*Made by special order of Emperor K‘anghsi.”’? Height, 2} inches; diameter, 44 inches.
44, 45. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, having a ‘‘sitting’’ imperial fiveclawed dragon on center, and similar flying dragons (see No. 4) amid clouds around the shelving side. Engraved in the paste under a thick deep-blue glaze (blew de roi) which covers the entire plate inside and out, except the foot, on which appears within a double circle Ta-ch‘ing K‘ang-hsi-nien-chih, ‘‘ Made during the K ‘anghsi period of the Great Pure (the present) dynasty.” Diameter, 9% inches.
46. Bowl, large, everted, of pure white K’anghsi porcelain, plain inside. On outside is a branch of peach tree bearing fruit and leaves, the latter in all stages from the light green of the newly burst leaf to the brown of the withered and worm-eaten, admirably painted. On the branch is seated a large bird, termed by the Chinese a paroquet, but having a red beak, brown breast, green plumage around neck and below it, with brown on back, and black and gray wings and tail. A fine specimen. Mark, as above. Height, 33 inches; diameter, 8} inches. (See Plate 1.)
47, 45. Wine-cups (a pair), small, with straight lips, of white K’anghsi porcelain, covered outside with a monochrome dull glaze of violet magenta; plain inside, except at bottom, where are two plums and some beans delicately painted. Mark, as above. Height, 18 inches; diameter, 3} inches.
49-52. Bowls (4), everted, of white K‘anghsi porcelain, having imperial five-clawed flying dragons (see No. 4) engraved in paste, over which are sprays of roses and plum-blossoms, buds and leaves of various shades of green, open flowers and butterflies alternately yellow and aubergine purple-brown under a transparent glaze.

53. Vase, of square body, contracting to form short, circular, everted neck, on which above each side of the body is the character for ‘‘longevity,”’ shou, in four out of the hundred forms it may take in the ‘“‘seal’’ style of writing. The four sides of the body bear two paintings in the distinctive colors of /a famille verte, one of the famous club of the seven worthies of the bamboo grove amusing themselves with music, chess, and wine; the other a historical scene representing an ancient general on his way to attack the Man-tz’u, or Southern Chinese, giving audience during a halt upon the banks of the Yangtse.
Between the paintings are lengthy disquisitions suggested by the subjects of
the drawings. As these are dated ‘‘the 29th day of the 9th moon of the year
of the cyclic characters Kwei mo,’’ that is, 1703, it is justifiable to conclude that is the date of the vase, that being the only year to which these characters would apply during K ‘anghsi’s reign to which the coloring shows it to
belong. Mark, a leaf. Height, 183 inches. (See Plate 2.)
The club of the seven worthies of the bamboo grove was an association of convivial men of letters, formed in the latter half of the third century, who were accustomed to meet for learned discussions and jovial relaxation in a grove of bamboos. The seven worthies were Hsiang Tz’u-Ch‘i; Chi Shu-yeh, a celebrated functionary and man of letters, but no less renowned as a lover of the wine-cup and as a musician. He was also an ardent devotee of alchemy. Incurring the displeasure of Ss’u-ma Chao, minister of the last sovereign of the house of Wei, he was executed as a propagator of magic arts and heretical doctrines, when he showed his contempt of death by tuning his guitar on the way to execution; Lin Po-lun, who was wholly devoted to joviality and wished he could be accompanied by a gravedigger to at once inter him should he fall dead over his cups; Shan Chii-yuan, a statesman, under Wu Ti of the T‘ang dynasty, celebrated for the patronage he extended to rising talent; Wang Chiinchung, a minister of Hwei Ti of the house of Chin, at once infamous for his avarice and for having intrusted the discharge of his duties to base underlings that he might abandon himself to a life of extravagance and pleasure; Ytian Chung-jung, famous as a lover of music and wine, and as a philosopher studying content and moderation in preference to the ways of ambition; and Yuan Tz’u-tsung, uncle of the last, a public functionary, but preferring the quietism preached by the philosophers Lao-tze and Chuang-tze, whose follower he professed himself to be, to the toils of public life.!
54, 55. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, decorated inside with a painting in natural colors of the great Taoist sage and philosopher Lao-tze, with lofty head, seated under a tree; his attendant is preparing writing materials for his use. Round the brim are the eight Buddhistic emblems joined by conventional foliage of natural color, but of paler tones than the central design. Mark, as on No. 44. Diameter, 6} inches.
Lao-tze was the founder of the Taoist system of philosophy. He is said to have been surnamed Li and named Erh, but his history is almost altogether legendary. His biography, as given by the great historian Ss’u-ma Chien, who wrote the first comprehensive survey of the history of China from the legendary period of Huangti down to B. C. 104, contains, however, some particulars which may be considered authentic. According to this account he was the keeper of the records at Lo, the capital of the Chou dynasty, about the close of the sixth century B. C., and professed a doctrine of abstraction from worldly
‘Mayers, Chinese Reader’s Manual, Nos. 246, 411, 587, 799, 963, 968,

cares based upon speculations regarding Tao, Reason, and Té, Virtue. This excited the curiosity of Confucius, who is said to have visited him and to have retired disconcerted at his bold flights of imagination. The veracity of the statement regarding this meeting is, however, open to doubt. After a long period of service Lao-tze is said to have retired to the West, after confiding to Yin Hsi, the keeper of the frontier pass of Han Ku, a written statement of his philosophy, the Tao-lé-ching, or Classic of Reason and Virtue. Later mystics improved upon this account by assigning a period of mythical antiquity and a miraculous conception through the influence of a star to Lao-tze’s birth, alleging him to have been the incarnation of the supreme celestial entity. According to the Lieh-hsien-ch‘uan. an account of the Taoist genii, he became incarnate B. C. 1321, in the State of Ts‘u. His mother brought him forth from her left side beneath a plum tree, to which he at once pointed, saying: “I take ny surname (namely, Li, a plum) from this tree.”” When born his head was white and his countenance that of an aged man, from which circumstance he derived his name of Lao-tze, the Old Child. The remainder of the account resembles that given above, except that he is made to live for centuries, eventually retiring to the West about B. C. 1080. No countenance is given, however, in the writings ascribed to his pen to supernaturalism of any kind, and the legends regarding his life have evidently been largely colored by the accounts given by Buddhistic writers of the life of S’4kyamuni. The ideas contained in the Tao-té-ching of Lao-tze, which has been translated into English, French, and German, are thus summed up by Mr. Mayers:' ‘‘Creation proceeding from a vast, intangible, impersonal first principal, self-existent, self-developing, the mother of all things. The operation of this creative principle fulfilled in the nature of man, the highest development of which again is to be sought for in a return through ‘quietism’ and ‘non-action’ to the mother principle. The highest good is accordingly to be enjoyed in a transcendental abstraction from worldly cares, or
freedom from mental perturbation. In a doctrine such as this it.
is not difficult to trace at least a superficial likeness to the theories of Brahminism, and whether originally derived from Hindu thought or not it is probable that the cultivation of Lao-tze’s teachings had a potent influence in preparing the way for an influx of the metaphysical speculations of Indian philosophers to satisfy a mental craving not provided for in the simple materialism which Confucius expounded. At least the latitude allowed by the vagueness of Laotze’s writings both enabled and encouraged his so-called disciples and adherents to graft upon the leading notions of his text an entirely adventitious code of natural and psychical philosophy, which, on the one hand, expanded into a system of religious belief, a simple travesty of Buddhism, and, on the other, became developed into a school of mysticism, founded apparently upon the early secrets of the professions of healing and divination, from whence it rose to occult researches in the art of transmuting metals into gold and insuring longevity or admission into the ranks of the genii. To all these professions and pretensions the title of the religion or teachings of Tao was given, anes they were in reality
' Chinese Rena $s Manual No. 336,

in no wise countenanced by the doctrines of Lao-tze himself. His professed disciples, Lieh Tze and Chuang Tze in the fourth century, and Huai Nan Tze in the second century B. C., progressively developed the mystic element thus introduced, and a notable impetus accrued to it from the superstitious belief with which the pretensions of the alchemists were received by the Emperor Wu Ti, from whose period onward the reverence paid to the founder of the sect began to assume a divine character.’’ In A. D. 666 he was for the first time ranked among the gods, being canonized by the Emperor as ‘‘The Great Supreme, the Emperor of the Dark First Cause,”’ and his title was again enlarged in 1013. The achievement of corporeal immortality having been the chief aim of the sect named after him, the founder, Lao-tze, naturally came to be considered the God of Longevity, and as such he figures in all the paintings symbolical of a prayer for ‘‘dignity, happiness, and long life,”’ being usually depicted as an aged man leaning upon a staff, his head being of abnormally lofty proportions.
‘ The pa-chi-hsiang or ‘‘eight lucky emblems”’ are of Buddhistie origin and derived from India. Formed in clay or of wood, they are offered on Buddhistic altars, and largely enter into the architectural decoration of the temples. They are found with variations both of shape and of detail. In their ordinary form they are:
(1) A bell (chung), or more usually a wheel (/un), chakra, the wheel of the law, with fillets. (2) A univalve shell (/o), the chank shell of the Buddhists, with fillets. (3) A state umbrella (san), with fillets. (4) A canopy (kai), with fillets. (5) A lotus-flower (/ien-hua), without fillets; sometimes represented as a Pxonia moutan.
6) A vase with cover (kuan), with fillets.
) Two fishes (erh yii), united by fillets. Said by some to be figurative of domestic happiness.
(8) An angular knot with fillets, termed ch‘ang, the intestines, an emblem of longevity.
Another style of decoration, also consisting of eight emblems, is that known as the pa-pao, or “‘eight precious things;’’ they vary considerably in form, and the explanations of their meaning are unreliable and conflicting. The more usual forms, all of which bear fillets, are: (1) an oblate spherical object (chén), representing a pearl; (2) a hollow disk inclosing an open square, possibly a copper cash emblematical of riches; (3) an open lozenge, placed horizontally; (4) a lozenge placed horizontally, with a section of a second lozenge in the upper angle; (5) an object resembling in shape a mason’s square —the sonorous stone ching, emblematic by symphony of ‘‘goodness,’’ ‘‘ happiness;’’ (6) two oblong objects placed side by side, possibly books; (7) two rhinoceros horns shaped into quadrangular form; (8) a leaf of the Artemisia, an emblem of good augury. Other forms found in these emblems are a branch of coral, a silver ingot, a cake of ink; and the shell, lotus-flower, and fishes belonging properly to the ‘‘ eight lucky emblems.”’
56,47. Plates (a pair)of thin pure white K ‘anghsi porcelain, having a flying Féng huang
and an imperial five-clawed dragon (see No. 4) amid clouds contained bya floral scroll pattern within bands, all engraved in the paste. Round the rim is a border of bats set close to one another in vermilion red; and in center within a medallion, are the characters hung-fu-ch'i-t‘ien ‘great happiness fills the

heaven,”’ in the old seal form engraved in the paste from beneath the foot,
but reversed so that they read correctly on the upper side of the plate. Mark, Ta-ch‘ing-k‘ang-hsi nien-chih, ‘made during the K ‘anghsi period of the great Pure Dynasty.’’ Diameter, 73 inches.
58,59. Plates (a pair) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, for use on birthday occasions
in the palace. The ornamentation consists in the center of the plate of a large shou (longevity) character in blue, containing a pointed peach of the genii in enamel glaze, upon which is represented a stork (Grus viridirostis Veillot) in blue (the peach and stork being emblems of immortality, see No. 27). Round this medallion is entwined conventional foliage in enamel colors, branching apart to afford eight spaces, in which are alternately a peach and the character shou in gold on blue medallion. Outside, on the rim, light-green bamboo stalks spring from rocks on which grows the red fungus of the immortals (ling chih). Mark as in last. Diameter, 8} inches.
60. Vase, circular in shape, of white K‘anghsi porcelain, belonging to the famille
verte. On it is represented a garden with a pavilion in the rear. In it the seven worthies of the bamboo grove (see No. 53) are depicted engaged in chess-playing, music, and writing upon the rocks, the main picture being confined by bands of arabesque ornaments interrupted by panels, containing scholars’! requisites, books, scrolls, ete., and above, around the neck, a rodfishing scene. Mark as above. Height, 18} inches. (See Plate 3.)
61-68. Panels (8) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, bearing representations of famous
scenes from the celebrated historical novel San kuo-chih, or Records of the Three Kingdoms. This work, the most popular of its kind in China, details the triangular contest engaged in for the throne between Liu Pei, assisted by Chu-Ko-liang, Chang Fei, and Kuan Yii and Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, after his defection from Liu Pei, and the Sun family, which resulted in the partition of the Empire among the houses of Han of § Szechuen, Of Wu and of Wei, founded, respectively, by Liu Hstian-té, Sun Chung-mou and Ts‘ao Méng-té (A. D. 220 to 280).
69-76. Panels (8) of white K‘anghsi porcelain decorated with flowers and butterflies
in enamel colors and gold, surrounded by a border of the same upon a palegreen ground picked out with black. These panels were originally in the form of bricks of about an inch and a quarter thickness. It was customary in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for princes to have large couches, 6 to 8 feet in length and having two end pieces, of ebony beautifully carved. The one I have seen had five of these square porcelain panels or bricks let into the back with a circular panel above the central one of the five, and one in either end piece. They were so fixed by means of square projections from the wood-setting which fitted into corresponding holes left for the purpose in the bricks that one surface showed on either side of the setting with a rich and pretty effect, one surface displaying some historical scene, the other a group of flowers. Good specimens are now comparatively rare, and are much sought after by foreigners to saw in half for the manufacture of cache-pots.
77, 78. Panels (2) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, of similar origin to the above, but of
inferior style of painting.
79. Brick (small) of white K‘anghsi porcelain, showing the appearance of Nos. 61 to
78 in their original condition, before the surface plates had been sawn away from the central portion into which fitted the wooden projections serving to keep the porcelain ornamentation in its Sgsge de in the couch.

80. Vase of white K‘anghsi porcelain; shape, slender potiche. The ornamentation in chief seems to depict a young officer leaving his post after a virtuous tenure of office, which has won for him not only promotion from the Emperor but also the love of the people he has ruled over. A young man dressed in pink is represented riding a piebald horse. (In the time of K‘anghsi the Manchu officers despised and ridiculed Chinese luxury and ceremony, and with them the sedan chairs they have in later days adopted, with almost all else that is Chinese, from the conquered nation; and rode on horseback with but few attendants.) Over him an attendant is holding an official umbrella, which from its three flowers of different colors would appear to be a wauming-san, or ‘umbrella of ten thousand names,’’ an offering made to a virtuous and upright officer on his departure from his post by a grateful people, and so called from the fact that it bears upon it the names of the donors either embroidered or in black velvet appliqué. He is preceded by men bearing lanterns and followed by an attendant carrying a scroll wrapped in imperial yellow silk, indicative of acommunication from the throne. Round the part where the vase diminishes in size runs a band of floral pattern ona pink ground interrupted by panels containing grotesque representations of dragons, the whoie bounded on either side by bands of a geometric pattern in blue—all painted seemingly above the glaze. Nomark. Height, 103inches.
81. Vase of pure white K‘anghsi porcelain, tall, the body bellying out from the foot and then gradually tapering upward. On one side is a character show (longevity), on the other the character fu (happiness) in a diaper pattern in black upon a dark enamel green. In the center of each of these characters is a medailion about 4 inches in diameter, containing mythological representations appropriate to the character in which it is placed. On the former is the Genius of Longevity (as Lao Tze, see No. 54) riding a white stork into the midst of the Immortals. On the latter Tung Wang Kung, the consort of the Queen of the Fairies (see No. 28), is handing a baby the elixir of life, while another of the sages stands by holding the ju-i. Where the body of the vase springs from the foot isa band of formal geometric pattern and round the rim isa border of flowers on dark grey ground interrupted by white panels inclosing flowers, the whole supported by a narrow band of geometrical design. A beautiful specimen of K‘anghsiware. Height, 16} inches.
The ju-i is a curved baton, generally carved in jade or some other valuable material. It is probably of Buddhistie origin, as it is one of the seven precious things (Sansk. Sapta Ratna) and appears in Buddhist pictures in the hands of priests of high rank. It is also regarded as a symbol of the power of the faith. In Chinait is commonly considered an emblem of good luck, its name signifying “(May all be) as you wish,”’ and is therefore frequently used as a present to friends or at a wedding. It is also a sign of authority, owing to the fact that it is believed to have been used in India as a scepter. (See Plate 3.)

As each artist gives some more or less romantic designation to his studio, so the Emperor and princes give some fanciful name to their palace, or a portion of it, which is not unfrequently found upon porce-
: lain specially made for use in a special hall or pavilion, or for use
by the owner of the ‘‘hall.’’ In this case Fui-ss’u-t‘ang was the designation given to a portion of his palace by the Imperial Prince Ho, living during Yungchéng’s reign, who enjoyed one of the eight titles of hereditary princedom by blood royal conferred upon as many of the most noted Manchu captains at the time of the conquest of China. These hereditary princes are commonly termed ““iron-helmet princes,’’ and the distinction is one very seldom conferred since.

—_ bo
Above a sheer abyss crag o’erhangs crag, Whose heads aloft in purple distance soar, Whose look to mind recalls the five Star-gods Who help’d great Shun to rule in days of yore; And shady glens betwixt form cool retreats Where sages meet to con their mystie lore.
It is recorded that the ‘“‘Five Old Men,”’ the spirits of the Five Planets, appeared at court B. C. 2246, and assisted the Emperor Shun with | their counsels till he abdicated in favor of Yui, when they disappeared. Shun then dedicated a temple to the five planets and offered sacrifices in their honor, whereupon “five long stars’’? appeared in the heavens with other auspicious signs. 3

Rice-bowls (4) of white Yungchéng porcelain covered with closely-crackled (truité) glaze, having a purple tint rubbed into the crackling. Decoration, inside, at bottom, a peach with six leaves, forming a medallion; outside, four of the Buddhistic emblems (see No. 54), each supported on either side by a spray of flowers, to which it is attached by long flowing ribbons.

169. Cup of pure white Yungchéng porcelain of circular shape, everted. Decoration consists of, inside, waves at bottom, at sides bats, and at brim a border of Grecian pattern, all engraved in paste under transparent glaze; outside, between bands of a very delicate diaper pattern of red at brim, and of green with light-red center at foot, is depicted a high officer (possibly the Emperor himself) with two attendants descending the steps of a pavilion built under the shade of wide-spreading trees, and bearing in hisarms the ju-i, or emblem of power, to meet a military officer, who, haying just dismounted from his horse, around which stand subordinate officers and attendants, is advancing to meet the former. The inscription Ch‘u-chiang-ju-huwang-chih-pei, ‘Cup of him who departed as General and returned as Grand Secretary,’’ shows the cup to have been ordered by the Emperor to confer upon some high officer who had been commander-in-chief in some war, and who had been invested with the high distinction of grand secretary upon his return crowned with
victory. It should be added that in China military officers always occupy a relatively lower rank than do civil officers, and that the dignity of grand secretary, of which there are four, is the highest to which any subject, not of princely rank, can attain. Who the officer so honored in this instance was has not been as yet determined.

among all the Buddhistic people of Asia, and, as the emblem of
Thor, among Teutonic races. In China it is the symbol of the — Buddha’s heart, 7. ¢., of the esoteric doctrines of Buddhism, and is
the special mark of all deities worshipped by the Lotus school.

Upon the body are sprays of peony — (Pxonia moutan), plum blossom, and chrysanthemum above, and below branches, each bearing fine fruits, of pomegranate, peaches, and lichees; confined at foot by a deep band of upright leaves—all in deep blue, shaded, under a thin transparent glaze. Mark as in last. Height, 123 inches. Rice-bowls (2) of white Chienlung porcelain, ornamented with designs well painted in deep blue under a transparent glaze; inside, at bottom, a medal-_ lion of conventional ornate scroll-work; outside, three clusters, one of bamboo, one of plum-blossom, and one of pine. Mark as in last. Height, 23 inches; diameter, 5} inches. P’énglai-shan (Mount Horai of the Japanese) was one of the three Isles
of the Genii, supposed to lie off the eastern coast of China, in which
flowed the fountain of life in a perpetual stream, giving sempiternal
vigor to the happy denizens of this paradise who drank its waters.
The pine, the bamboo, the plum, the peach, and the fungus of longevity grew forever on its shores; the long-haired tortoise dis-
ported in its rocky inlets, and the white crane built her nest in the
limbs of its everlasting pines. All these have thus come to be emblematical of long life. The first three, however, are almost
always found in combination under the title of swng-chu-mei (pine,
as adjuncts to the appropriate genii.

193. Vuse of white Chienlung porcelain, slender in shape, sloping gently outward to about two-thirds of height, then gently contracting to form neck, which curves outward at brim. Upon a ground of delicate pale green throughout is painted the decoration, which consists of conventional flowers and foliage of varied colors outlined in gold. This main decoration is confined at foot by a deep border of formal foliated scroll pattern in brick red on a yellow — ground, and at base of neck by a narrow border of same, from which — springs a crown of banana leaves of light green, veined with gold and outlined with blue; above this is a band of conventional flowers and foliage — confined by a foliate scroll outlined with blue and gold on a yellow ground. Mark in gold same as on Nos. 186, 187. Height, 133 inches.
194. Vase of white Chienlung porcelain. Circular in shape, curving gently outward till at four-fifths of its height it contracts to form a short neck curying outward at brim.

No mark. Height, 142 inches. (See Plate 10.)
A common motive with Chinese artists is the presentation to Lao Tze (see No. 54), the great philosopher and founder of the Taoist sect, of an immortality peach by Tung Wang Kung, the consort of the legendary Queen of the Fairies, Hsi Wang Mu, or by one of his — attendants, on the Sage’s arrival at her mountain palace in the K’unlun range (see No. 28). The same subject is here depicted, a bat replacing the peach. Since the pronunciation of the character for ‘‘ bat’’ is the same as of that for ‘‘ happiness,”’ the five bats symbolize the ‘‘five blessings or happinesses.’’ Lao Tze is receiving the first, ‘‘longevity;’’ the remaining four—riches, peacefulness and serenity, love of virtue, and an end crowning the life—hover over his head.
196-201. Wine cups (6) of white Chienlung porcelain, colored, inside, pale green; outside, deep blue (bleu de roi), on which spread sprays of peony, yulan (magnolia conspicua), and grasses delicately painted in gold, and confined at brim and where cup springs from the foot by a band of Grecian pattern, also in gold.

Yang Kuei-fei, the daughter of an obscure official in the modern Szee-
huen, was introduced by the designing minister Li Liu-fu into the seraglio of the Emperor Ming Huang, of the T‘ang dynasty (died A. D. 762). Becoming enamored of her beauty, the Emperor abandoned the wise counsels of Chang Yiich, Chang Chin-ling, and other ministers, under whose administration the empire enjoyed great prosperity, and sank, year by year, more deeply in the toils of amorous dalliance. The Princess Yang’s three sisters were also introduced into the seraglio and endowed with valuable fiefs. No outlay was spared in gratifying the caprices and covetousness of this family of favorites, and the nation was sacrificed to the licentious enjoyment of the court, till at last the people rose in revolt, the aged monarch was forced to take refuge in western China, and, after undergoing the misery of witnessing the butchery of his favorites, to abdicate in favor of his son. Shih, the daughter of humbie parents, but the ne plus ultra of loveliness in Chinese tradition. A report of her consummate beauty having reached the ears of her sovereign, Kou Chien, Prince of Yiuch, a state occupying the east coast of China below the Yangtse in the fifth century B. C., he had the girl trained in all the accomplishments of her sex and sent her as a present to his victorious rival, the Prince of Wu, in the hope that her charms might prove hisruin. Thestratagem was successful and Fu Ch’a, Prince of Wu, abandoning himself to lustful dalliance, was ere long defeated and crushed. It is said of Hsi Shih that finding her beauty was enhanced by an air of melancholy, she was accustomed to knit her brows as though in pain, and this device, adding as it did to her attractiveness, was copied by rival beauties, who vainly sought to equal her charms.! 244.

The use of spiked metal supports to keep vessels of porcelain in positi within the kiln has been generally considered peculiar, in the East to the Japanese system of manufacture.

summoned to an interview in the palace, where he was received with exaggerated honors. The Emperor himself handed the dishes, his — favorite and haughty concubine was required to rub the ink for his use, and the chief eunuch and privy counsellor, Kao Li-Sze, had to divest him of his boots when overcome by wine. The Emperor’s favorite, smarting under the indignity to which she thought herself subjected in his honor, barred the door to his official employment, and Li T‘ai-po led ‘‘for the remainder of his life a wandering existence, celebrating in continual flights of verse the praises of bacchanalian enjoyment and of the beauties of nature in the various localities he visited.’’ (Mayers.)

Mark as on No. 380.
The magpie is especially dear to the present occupants of the throne of China from the part it played in the divine origin of their first ancestor. The Chinese chronicle runs as follows: Immediately east of the pumice peaks of the Ch‘ang-pai-shan (Long White Mountain) is a high mountain called Bukuli, at the foot of which is the small lake or pool Buhuli. After bathing one day in this pool, the maiden Li Fokolun found on the skirt of her raiment, placed there by a magpie, a fruit which she ate, and which caused her to give birth to a boy of an appearance different from ordinary people, whence she called him You heaven-born to restore order to the disturbed nations. His surname she called Aisin-Gioro, his name Bukuli-yung-shun. She disappeared, and he, embarking in a small boat, floated with the riverstream. In the neighborhood of a place where peoples of three surnames were at war, he disembarked, and was breaking off willow branches, when one of the warriors, coming to draw water, saw him.

Amazed at his strange appearance, the warrior hastily retired to inform the people of the remarkable man he had seen. The curious people went to the bank and asked his name and surname, to whom he replied: I am the son of the heavenly maiden Fokolun, ordained by heaven to restore peace among you, and thereupon they nominated him king, and he reigned there in Odoli City, in the desert of Omohi, east of Ch‘ang-pai-shan.’’ Another version of the legend states that there were three heavenly maidens Angela, Changhela, and Fokolun. The first two returned to heaven, while Fokolun remained on earth to nurse the miraculous babe till he grew up. Then she told him to wait till a man came to fish. The fisherman came and adopted the boy, and Fokolun ascended to heaven. Pére Amyot, from whom this account is taken, identifies Fokolun with a sixteenarmed goddess whom he calls Pussa, or the Chinese Cybele, but described at the present day as a Boddhisatwa, a celestial candidate
for Buddhahood. ‘The story continues that Aisin-Gioro, in spite of ©
his heavenly birth, was put to death by his people, and only his youngest son, Fancha, escaped by the aid of a magpie, which alighted on his head as he ran and made his pursuers think him the stump ofa tree. Fancha fled from Odoli across the Ch‘ang-paishan to Hotuala and there, some two centuries before the birth of Nurhachu, the first Manchu chieftain who took up arms against the Chinese, he laid the foundations of the future dynasty of China.

By CHar.es Kasson Weap,
Examiner, United States Patent Office.
In the development of musical scales four stages may be recognized:
1. The stage of primitive music, where there is no more indication of a scale than in the sounds of birds, animals, or of nature. Students of the origin of music may give free rein to their fancy in this period, and the uncertain musical utterances of living primitive peoples may be construed in accordance with almost any prepossession of the hearer.
2. The stage of instruments mechanically capable of furnishing a scale. This stage has been almost entirely overlooked by students and is the special subject of the following paper.
3. The stage of theoretical melodic scales—Greek, Arab, Chinese, Hindu, Medieval, etc. All the original treatises concerning these scales imply that a stage of development has been reached far in advance of the second. Thousands of pages have been written on this stage, largely polemical and lacking in insight, for the subject has been a dark one; but Ellis and Hipkins’s work of 1885 has thrown a flood of light on it.
4. The stage of the modern harmonic scale and its descendent, the equally tempered scale, which are alike dependent both on a theory and on the possibility of embodying it in instruments. The relation of this scale to the present study will be noticed later.
These four stages, of course, overlap even in the same locality; they correspond in a rough way to the recognized four culture stages, namely: the savage, barbarous, civilized, and enlightened.
At the outset it should be recognized that the only working hypothesis the physicist can use is that of the instrumental origin of scales. Helmholtz’s view that the harmonics in the voice and in the tones of instruments were influential in settling the positions of the notes of our scale is obviously consistent with this hypothesis; and his opinion that this influence acted on other scales need not be wholly rejected, though some of his historical authorities were untrustworthy, and

<<<Page: 645>>>

some of his coincidences between other scales and the harmonic scale ‘an be explained in other and simpler ways. Writers less careful than Helmholtz have made the assumption that these harmonics and the constitution of the ear must have guided primitive musicians to a substantially harmonic scale; and one writer has even maintained that instruments corrupted the taste of men. But as yet there has been no such body of facts collected in support of this assumption as need delay one following out the other theory. Of course the knowledge of the scales is only a stepping-stone to the understanding of the music and something of the life of a people; so some day the materials worked into shape by the physicist may be built into a fairer structure by the psychologist.
The broad fact which underlies all study of scales was recognized by the Greek musician Aristoxenus three centuries before the Christian era. He pointed out that the voice, in speaking, changes its pitch by insensible gradations, while in singing it moves mostly by leaps. We recognize the same fact when we say that a singer follows a scale, but do not say it of aspeaker. The one, to use the common figure, ascends or descends a ladder or staircase; the other follows a continuous slope, and may never step twice in the same place. Now, it is quite possible that in a song the voice may always move by leaps, and in repeating the song always take the same leaps as closely as can be observed, yet never strike a note which it has struck before; just as one may toss a stone up and down on a hillside, marking each time where it lands, and after a hundred tosses finds it had not landed twice at quite the same level, or in striding up and down hill may never plant his foot twice at the same level. I think this was the character of the songs of the first stage and of much primitive song to-day, though the evidence is too scanty to be conclusive. |
However this may be, it is certain that most peoples who have attained any moderate degree of civilization have attempted to limit the number of steps to be taken by the voice in any song between the highest and lowest note, and to fix these steps by rules, so that many men may learn them and bein substantial agreement. Various old writers give the rules in vogue among Greek theorists; in the last century Amiot described the Chinese rules, while in the last two decades the rules of Arab, Hindu, Japanese, and Siamese musicians have been made accessible. The most familiar rules, as is well known, depend on that law of vibrating strings which is followed by a violinist in his fingering—namely, that the frequency of vibration of parts of any stretched string is inversely as the length of the parts, provided the tension does not change. Our latest rule, historically derived from one of the many Greek and Arab rules by subdividing the whole tones, so giving twelve steps to the octave, is embodied on the neck of a guitar or mandolin; here it is obvious that the successive stopping points as

<<<Page: 646>>>

gf <a ——
marked by frets get closer and closer together as the pitch rises. All musicians know that this number of notes, twelve, is found confusingly great for ordinary playing, and know the principles by which the player selects certain notes for any tune. But this multiplicity of notes has an important bearing on all studies on nonharmonic music made by harmonic musicians. For every sound within the compass of the instrument comes very near to some one of the twelve netes and may readily be represented thereby, owing to the difficulty the hearer has in estimating deviations from the familiar series and in noting them down. The results of this approximation are to mask all deviations from the twelve-tone piano scale, whether intentionally or accidentally made, and to make it appear to musicians, first, that nearly all the music of the world is performed substantially in our scale; and second, that any other theoretical scales, such as those found among Orientals, or deseribed by our European ancestors, are merely mathematical jug-
-glery and of as little significance as proposals for a change that ocea-
sionally appear in modern musical or scientific journals.
It is the purpose of this paper first to describe several types and forms of instruments widely used, each embodying a principle of scale building distinctly unlike ours, though sometimes giving a result that seems surprisingly familiar. Nearly all these instruments, it will be noted, belong to what was called above the second or barbarous stage, though a few of them come from countries where musicians have reached the third and fourth stages. A second purpose is to present anew and generic principle of primitive scale-building applicable to the various types of instruments discussed.
But before going further it must be recognized that the word **scale” has many meanings. Perhaps the lowest and loosest is—the series of sounds used in any musical performance, arranged in order of pitch. The one that will most closely fit the present needs is—the series of sounds produced upon a particular instrument: while the most exact definition, but one applicable only where musical principles are well developed is this:
A scale is an independently reproducible series of sounds arranged in order of pitch, recognized as « standard and fitted for musical Purposes.
While the last two definitions imply an instrument in which tne scales are embodied, the limitation is in appearance only, for there is no evidence that any musicians do have a standard series of tones, unless they have one or more instruments embodying it, and have learned the series directly or indirectly from such an instrument.

<<<Page: 647>>>

In sharp contrast to that widely used division of a string which we know on the guitar, showing decreasing distances between the frets as the pitch rises, we find many instances of a uniform spacing of the frets through a considerable distance. Instances from four countries may here be cited:
1. The well-known architect, Viollet-le-Duc,’ gives a figure (fig. 1) of a mandolin from the end of the sixteenth century which shows frets for the first seven semitones pretty uniformly spaced; the frets for the next five to complete the octave are again uniform, though closer than before, and the following five are also uniformly | spaced and still closer. Figures in other books® of European lutes, viols, etc., very often show a similar equal spacing. These are too numerous to be lightly treated as artists’ blunders. Two instruments in the United States National Museum are illustrated in Plate 1.
2, Among the Greek rules given by Ptolemy is one for the division called Diatonon homalon, in which the whole string being twelve units long the points for stopping would be at 11, 10, 9, and 8, giving C, a note between Dp and D, Eb, F, and G. Here it will be noticed the intervals get larger and larger as the pitch rises. Again, Carl Engel*® refers to Drieberg’s drawing of the ancient
Fig. 1. Greek guitar in the Berlin Museum, EUROPEAN MANDOLIN. which has ‘‘seven frets at equal disphases ss tances,” but objects to it as it does not give a diatonic scale. The tracing of this drawing furnished by Professor Howard, of Harvard, adds to Engel’s data the fact that the whole compass of the six intervals is slightly more than an octave (fig. 2). 3. Among the instruments described in the Arabic treatise of the

be HISTORY OF MUSICAL SCALES. 425 b
famous Al Farabi,'! who died 950 A. D., is the short-necked tanhour _ of Bagdad, usually having two strings: on this a fret was first placed at one-eighth the length of the string from the upper end, and this _ space then divided into five equal parts. As the compass on each string was but little over a whole tone, each step was about a quarter-tone. _ These ligatures or frets are called ** heathen” or ‘* pagan,” and the tunes played on them ‘‘ heathen airs,” clearly indicating that there was a scale native to the people whom the Mohammedan armies had conquered, a scale utterly different from either that of the lute or the tanbour of Khorassan, with their resemblances to Greek scales. Three hundred years later, or about 1250 A. D., Safi-ed-din,’ a famous musician of Bagdad, wrote for his pupil, the son of the Vizier, a Treatise on Musical Ratios. He based them on string lengths, and in discussing instruments gives a figure of the frets on the neck of the lute, and it is noteworthy that these are equally spaced over a distance of a quarter length of the string. Further, he explains how of the ten frets in this short distance, located by various rules, five were fixed by arithmetical bisection or halving of the space between two frets already fixed; one of these, midway between what we should call D and E, if the open string gives C, was called the ‘‘ Persian middle,” and was very much in use in his time. Safi-ed-din® further describes, in two connections, a division of the Fourth, like the Greek one already quoted, where the string lengths are 12, 11, 10, 9, saying it is consonant and much used; in fact it is preferred to one that is substantially like the theoretical diatonic scale; still it should be added that when he comes to arrange intervals to make up two octaves he puts our arrangement along with the most agreeable half dozen genera.
4. In India there has been in modern times a curious reversion from an elaborate historical scale of twenty-two steps to the octave, of which no modern Hindu or European knows the theory, to an equal linear division;* one-half of the string on the s/tar is bisected; the first or end quarter-length is then divided into nine parts, each marked by a fret, and the second quarter-length into thirteen parts similarly marked. Out of the twenty-three tones within the octave the player selects a limited number, five, six, or seven, rarely eight, for any particular tune. Most of the notes used are found on calculation to be deceptively close to the notes of our chromatic scale, and so may be easily confounded with them by European hearers.

theorists, as by Jamard' in a treatise of 1759, a copy of which is in the — Lenox Library, New York; and Fétis’ in his brief account of this author refers to others who maintained similar views.
The simple flutes are instruments of a type more primitive and more widely distributed than fretted stringed instruments. These instruments are sometimes side-blown, as is the case with the modern flute; or end blown, as one blows into a key or pan’s pipe; or blown with a whistle mouthpiece, like the flageolet; or blown with a weak reed, as the oboe. For the purposes of this discussion the mode of exciting the vibration is immaterial. All of them embody the law that the frequency of vibration of a column of air in a tube depends mainly on its length, and the variation in length of the air column so as to produce several sounds from one tube is produced by opening holes in the sides of the tube. In practice these holes never can open so freely to the outside air that the portion of the tube beyond them may be considered as removed (the possibility or necessity of cross-fingering proves this to the player), so the proper location and diameter of the holes to produce the notes of our scale of even quality are fixed, not by a simple law as the frets on the guitar are located, but by laborious experimenting to get a standard instrument which is then reproduced with Chinese fidelity.
Now, as one looks over a collection of wind instruments, like the splendid one in the U. S. National Museum, or examines flutes figured in books, it will be easy to recognize that there are two principal types—(A) those having the holes spaced at sensibly equal distances, and (B) those having two groups each of three equally spaced holes, the interval between the nearest holes of the two groups being obviously greater than that between the holes of each group. As the common primitive method of making the holes is by burning, the holes are generally more uniform in diameter than those on European flutes of a century ago.
Illustrations of flutes of type A are found in Engel’s Musical Instruments, some of which are copied on Plate 2. Dr. Wilson’s paper on Prehistoric Art® has many more illustrations, as the figures of bone flutes from Costa Rica and British Guiana, of pottery flutes from Mexico and the Zuni Indians, of tubes with a simple reed from Egypt and Palestine, of wooden flutes brought from Thibet by Mr. Rockhill, and a wooden flute from the Kiowa Indians. Fétis* has a cut of the staghorn flute from the stone age with three equidistant holes, referred

to by Wilson (p. 526). So far as is known not one of the peoples from whom these instruments have come has any musical theory, but some of them do have a principle of instrument construction; fora partly educated young Kiowa Indian, in Washington a few years ago, in a party under charge of Mr. James Mooney, showed the writer how the holes on a flute on which he played were located by measuring three finger-breadths from the lower end to the. lower hole, and then taking shorter but equal spaces for the succeeding holes. The interpreter added that he had seen the holes spaced by cutting a short stick as a measure. The late Mr. F. H. Cushing has furnished the additional fact that measurement by finger-breadths is very common among Indians; and Dr. Fewkes' gives a figure to show how the prayer sticks, used by the Hopi Indians in the Snake ceremonials at Walpi, are measured off into seven parts by the distances from creases on the hand to the tip of the finger. On the Kiowa flute (Plate 4, No. 2) the distance between the centers of the holes is 32 mm., which is two medium finger-breadths. Some instruments of this type belonging to the U.S. National Museum are shown in Plates 3 and 4.
But it is not only among primitive and prehistoric peoples that such a succession of holes is found. The common military fife has it. The bagpiper recently seen on the streets of Washington used a chaunter (oboe), the holes of which were at sensibly equal distances, so conforming to the well-known fact that the bagpipe scale is intentionally unlike the harp scale. A Japanese /ouye with 7 holes figured in the catalogue of the Kraus collection at Florence shows to the eye holes at nearly equal spaces, and has, as reported, the steps of the scale increasing in length as the pitch rises. From Egypt’ there have come twenty-five 3and 4-hole ancient flutes, or more exactly, oboes, and a few of 5, 6, and more holes. One of the 4-holed instruments from a tomb of about 1100 B. C. shows the holes 35 mm. apart and the lowest hole twice this distance from the bottom. Villoteau’s® plates of modern Egyptian instruments show various types of tubes with equally spaced holes.
Flutes of the second or B type with two groups of equal-spaced holes were sold in quantities at the Java village at the World’s Fair held in Chicago in t893 (Plate 6, No. 1). No two of the instruments seemed to have the same length or location of holes, but this grouping was unmistakable. Of this type is also a curious ancient Chinese instrument, the Zche, described by Amiot,‘ closed at both ends with

an embouchere at the middle and holes symmetrically placed on eachside dividing the whole length into thirds, quarters, and sixths; so, if the whole length is called 12, the mouth hole is at 6 and the finger holes at 2, 3,4, 8,9,and 10. Mahillon copied thé instrument, but did not close the ends, and reports the scale as a chromatic one from Eto A #. Most of the old European wood wind instruments figured by Preetorius' (1618) are conspicuously of this type, as the appended Plate 5 shows without necessity of description, and various similar instruments of the Museum collections are figured in Plate 6.
1. The next group includes a variety of instruments of the resonator type, a type that is widely distributed and conforms to a law hitherto unrecognized as capable of furnishing a scale; though Sondhaus in 1850 stated the law and tried a few rough experiments. The mathematicians” have proved that a mass of air in a confined space with a very small nearly circular opening, as a short-necked bottle or a whistle, has a frequency of vibration proportional to the square root of the fraction which expresses the diameter of the hole divided by the volume of the cavity; and if there are two such openings so placed that the flow of air through one does not interfere with that through the other, the numerator of the fraction will be the sum of the two diameters. Now extend the same principle, and one may have a series of sounds rising in pitch as one after another of several holes in the wall is opened; and provided the character of the vibration is not essentially changed, the frequency of vibration of these notes will increase as the square root of the sum of the diameters of the holes opened. Suppose, for example, that a vessel has one mouth-hole of diameter 2 and several properly placed tinger-holes of diameter 1; then on successively opening these a scale may be produced having vibration frequencies in the ratio of the square roots of 2, 3, 4,5, ete. A moment’s consideration will show that in such a scale the intervals between successive sounds become less and less as the pitch rises, instead of becoming greater as is the case with strings or flutes where the spacing of frets or holes is uniform.
The most elaborate and beautiful illustrations of instruments of this type are from graves in Central and South America. (See Plate 7.) The United States National Museum has many whistles from Chiriqui in Colombia, most of them giving but a single high note; these differ substantially, it will be noticed, from stopped organ pipes, since in the latter the mouth extends the full width of the tube. Whistles with one or two finger-holes have come from Mexico and San Salvador, but the most complete and perfect are from Costa Rica. Of these the one

<<<Page: 652>>>

bearing the catalogue number 59970 (Plate 7, fig. 1) has served as the type specimen, and is the instrument which led to this investigation. It has a globular body with bird’s head, a mouthpiece about in the position of a bird’s tail, and four finger-holes on the back symmetrically placed; these holes seem to be precisely equal in diameter, and equivalent in musical effect, so the order of fingering is a matter of indifference, and all the tones are clear and distinct; in Dr. Wilson’s paper,’ Mr. Upham, who is a violinist, notes them as F, A, C, D, E. On measurement the volume was found to be 36.0 cc., the equivalent diameter of the trapezoidal mouth hole 1 cm., and the diameter of the finger holes .65 em.; these diameters, however, need a correction on account of the thickness of the walls, since the air can not pass freely through the rather thick wall. The final result of the calculation is to give, with all finger-holes closed, the note F on the highest line of the treble staff, to within half a semitone, and on opening the fingerholes in any order to give the succession of intervals 4, 3, 2, and 2 equal semitones, with a mean error of only one-eighth E. 5. According to the theory the series of intervals depends only on the ratio between the diameters of the holes and the mouth hole, in this case 1 to 1.62; so the series of tones has vibration frequencies approximately as the square roots of 1.6, 2.6, 3.6, 4.6, 5.6, or of 1, 1.62, 2.24, 2.86, 3.48; but the pitch of all depends on the quotient of the radius of the mouth-hole by the volume. Although the theoretical correction for thickness of wall can not be quite precise, it affects all the holes to nearly the same extent, and the greatest probable error that can be assumed will not change the whole compass more than half a semitone; so the calculated scale would still be substantially what the ear confirms—F, A, C, D, E, or in syllables do, mz, sol, la, si.
The Museum has several other Costa Rican instruments also of pottery quite similar in appearance to this, but not capable of giving such clear tones, or quite so perfect in the equality of the holes. Tf the holes are unequal in diameter, in thickness of wall, or in location with reference to the vibrating mass of air, the order of pitch will depend on which holes are opened instead of merely on how many; with five holes sixteen combinations are possible; but of the eleven instruments in the Museum eight give only five notes each, two give seven notes, and one gives nine notes. If the finger-holes are small relatively to the mouth hole, the compass is small, so one high-pitched whistle has a compass of only six semitones—G to C#—and another runs from B to E; three have a compass of seven E. S., that is, a musical fifth, and two each have, respectively, eight, nine, and eleven semitones.
Still other National Museum instruments, similar in principle, but ruder in workmanship and more grotesque in form, have come from Chiriqui, Columbia, and are figured in Dr. Wilson’s report, pages 628
1 Report of United States National Museum for 1896, p. 617.

to 646. In other museums similar instruments are to be found. <A few from Chiriqui were briefly described forty years ago as belonging to the American Ethnological Society.*
In the American Museum of Natural History in New York, as reported by Prof. F. W. Putnam, half a dozen such threeand fourhole whistles from the region of Santa Marta, Colombia, are to be seen; while under his charge at Cambridge, Mass., there are a number from the Uloa Valley, Central America;* of those figured, three have three finger-holes and are said to give five notes each.
In the Brussels Conservatory Collection® there are twenty-five terra cotta instruments from Mexico; two of them are clearly of this resonator type, giving five notes and having a compass, respectively, of eight and eleven E. S. (fig. 3). Lastly, a similar instrument described and figured by Dr. Walter Hough, in the Report on the Columbian Historical Exposition at Madrid, 1892-1893, has the small compass of six E.S. The point should again be emphasized that with these instruments the notes get closer and closer together as the pitch rises; for instance, on the type instrument the successive intervals are in whole numbers 4, 3, 2, 2, E.S.; onthe Brussels instruments, 3, 2, 2,1, and 4, 3,2, 2; on the Madrid specimen, 2, 2, 1,1. A chart (Plate 10) will show more accurately what the four intervals are with any speci-

Of course the calculations assume uniformity in the blowing, for it is easy for the performer to vary the notes by a considerable amount. Still, it is a surprise to find how well these simple scales satisfy the ear.
A sort of stone flageolet from Costa Rica appears to be connected with these instruments in principle (Plate 7, fig. 8). This is closed at one end and has a small mouth opening and four finger-holes arranged in pairs; its scale of seven notes from five holes proves that the holes are not acoustically equivalent, but the two of each pair are found to be nearly equivalent; so on trial it appears that the square root formula may be applied, by giving to the mouth-hole the value 5, to each of the nearer holes the value 1, and to the other holes the value 2; then the vibration frequencies will be as the square roots of the numbers 5 to 11. The calculated intervals from the lowest note are 1.6, 2.9, 4.1, 5.1, 6.0, 6.8-E. S.: the observed intervals are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 E. S.

2. A pottery whistle found in the ruins of Babylon, dating probably from about 500 B. C., is in the Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society, London’ (fig. 4). Rowbotham* says this is similar to the reindeer joint used by the cave men. Its extreme length is 3 inches and it has two finger holes. The three notes are stated to be C (of 525 d. v.), E, and G; but the holes not being quite equal, the E from one of them is a quarter of a tone flat. By blowing hard the G can be carried up to A. The chart (Plate 10) shows that if the interval C—G is exact, with equal holes the intermediate note E will be a very little sharp of the piano note, but the difference is only about 1 per cent, one-fifth of a semitone, and so is utterly negligible in notes of such uncertain intonation.
3. Striking comparisons have sometimes been made, and especially by the late Prof. Terrien de la Couperie, between the Assyrian and early Chinese civilizations. Whatever their relations may have been, it is curious = that the only instrument of the resonator type, having several finger holes and coming from a people who had a musical theory, is the //siian (Van Aalst)’ or //iwen (Amiot)‘ of the Chinese, said to have been invented some 2,700 years before our era, and still used in the Confucian ceremonies, though very rarely seen. It is described as : hollow cone of baked clay about 33 inches high, having a mouth-hole at the top, three equal finger-holes on one side, and two equal holes on the other. The descriptions available are inconsistent and incomplete, but that given by Amiot a century ago is the fullest. He reports the scale as re, Ja, sol, la, do, ve, and as he gives a cut (fig. 5), also the diameters of holes and the external measures, an approximate calculation can be made of the scale by the laws of resonators. The pitch of the fundamental comes out D above middle C, and the other notes, F, G, and A, for one side; then starting anew for the other side we get C and D, all within a quarter of a semitone. This, it will be noticed, is a five-

step scale, like most of the theoretical Chinese scales. The agreement between the mathematical theory and observation is strikingly close.
4, Allthe cases thus far referred to have been of prehistoric or very ancient instruments. But some curious little instruments of this type are figured by Frobenius’ (fig. 6) as ‘ta splendid parallel between the cultures” of some West African tribes and the natives of New Pomerania. These are little whistles made out of gourds (a, b, d) or pottery (c). They have the mouth-hole and two, three, or four fingerholes. No dimensionsare given. Kraus, of Florence, figures and describes” a similar instrument from Melanesia made of a gourd 6 cm. in diameter, having three finger-holes close to the mouth-hole (fig. 7). The scale is stated to be A, B, C#, E, F, but no further measures are given. However, this series is

In the Finsch Collection in the American Museum of Natural History,
in New York City, there are several similar gourds of different sizes
having three finger-holes. They are labeled ‘‘ Blisekugeln,” ‘* used by women.”
5. In Europe there have been many instruments depending on the same general principle of resonance in a nearly closed cavity (in distinction from the open or closed organ-pipe principle), but not conforming to the simple law already set forth. Preetorius*® in his famous book of 1618 gives figures and descriptions of several such instruments, along with the recorders, flutes, violins, etc., that one reads of more frequently; for instance, he says the fagotti are sometimes closed at the extreme end, but have aside hole; the Cornamuse has the end closed and ¢, ogu.4n waste. holes in the side. Besides these he describes various inAfter Kraus. struments having stopped bodies on reeds—the rankett, bear pipes, etc., and similar forms onthe organ. These things have all gone out of use along with the other delicate and weak-toned instruments of their times. To-day musicians demand tones more powerful and richer in harmonies than instruments of this type can give. But a curious survival or revival of this earlier type occurred in the middle of this century, which is told of in Groves’s Dictionary of Music. A blind peasant, named Picco, gave public performances in London on a

flageolet 2 inches long and having only three holes. By partially or wholly closing the end of the tube with his hand he made use of the resonator principle to lower the pitch of his notes; so he obtained a compass of more than two octaves. The instrument is similar to Preetorius’s schweigel’ except that it is shorter, and the accuracy of the notes performed would depend almost wholly on the performer. Later a traveling troupe appeared in European cities with seven instruments called ocarinas. These are familiar to us, being on sale everywhere. They are properly resonators, but the holes are more numerous than in the instruments already considered and vary widely in size. The scale, which the instruments furnish with more or less precision, is not dependent on any simple principle, but is adjusted by the maker by varying the sizes of the holes so as to conform to a scale fixed on other instruments.
All the instruments of the three groups now discussed are ‘‘ fingered;” that is, the acoustical dimensions of the vibrating string or mass of air are varied as the player manipulates the fingers of one or both hands. These instruments therefore involve a feature not associated with drums and other instruments of percussion, or with primitive harps. Instead of using the hand as a whole, the more delicate fingers are utilized separately; so the simple instrument becomes in a peculiar sense a part of the player’s means of self-expression and is specially responsive to his own moods, as many legends of the power of music testify. But leaving to the musical writers such comparisons between instruments, it is important to the physicist to recognize that the dimensions of the human hand have fixed absolutely some dimensions of these instruments.
The first thing to strike one, considering the hand from this point of view, 1s the fact that only with difficulty can the five digits be brought into line, so the thumb is not used on primitive instruments for fingering, so far as observed. In the more highly developed flutes there may be a hole for it on the back side, while on our own flutes, clarinets, etc., it governs one or more keys. Similarly, the little finger does not ails fall in line with the three longer ones, and, besides, is much weaker. The remaining three fingers on a hand of medium size ‘an be brought into a space of about 1 em., or spread to span perhaps 12 cm. (5inches). To fix one’s ideas before comparing these limits with measures on some actual instruments, it will be convenient to recall that on piano keyboards the distance between key-centers an octave apart is 165 mm. (64 inches), the same as on a spinet of 1602; but on the physiologically Gesened Janko keyboard, with the octave distance
1Sy ae ae um, p. 39, pl. i

<<<Page: 657>>>

140 mm. (54 inches), an ordinary hand can readily span an octave and a Fifth, because the fingers are not forced into line. :
Examining first some string instruments, it is found that on a guitar of New York make (No. 55690, U.S.N.M.) the distance between frets ranges from 33 to 14 mm. The greatest distance noticed between frets is on the large Siamese Ava Chappee (No. 27310, U.S.N.M.), where there are three spaces, respectively, of 71, 73, and 77mm. A similar instrument examined at the World’s Fair held in Chicago had the corresponding spaces 60, 60, and 67 mm. The string lengths to the first frets were, respectively, 878 and 740 mm. The smallest distance observed between frets is the above-cited 14 mm., except ‘that the Syrian lute, Bizug (No. 95144, U.S.N.M.), has two spaces of 12and13 mm. On most instruments the frets cease when the limit of 20 to 25 mm. is reached. It is obvious that these and similar data for fretted instruments are not of much importance unless one can know that the hand was not shifted from one fret to another.
With our instruments shifting is notoriously common, but the histories of the violin report that two or three centuries ago it was a notable thing for a player to shift. The usual theory of the old many-stringed instruments, of which the Arab Jute is a particularly good example, required the strings to be tuned in Fourths, and the string lengths were not too great for the four fingers to govern all the frets within this range—that is, in a quarter-length of the string—so a shift would be unnecessary. On the Arab lute’ there were sometimes ten very unequally spaced frets in this space, but for any one tune only a few of them were used, and in the principal modes, ‘Ochag and fast, one fret each for the index and ring fingers sufficed to give substantially our diatonic scale.
With simple wind instruments the case is quite different, for seyeral fingers must be used simultaneously to cover holes, so the hand can not be shifted. 1n the Kiowa flute referred to above the uniform distance between holes is 32 mm.; in the stone whistle from Mexico, 20 mm.; in the four Egyptian flageolets and oboes figured by Villoteau (his Plate c c) the intervals are, respectively, 12, 15, 15, and 36 mm. These distances require only a convenient spread of the fingers. Many other measures can readily be obtained from the accompanying figures with their appended scales.
If the musician has a theory demanding that the holes be so near together or so far apart as to make direct fingering inconvenient or impossible, keys with long or short levers are added, as on modern flutes and clarinets, while among the Romans extra holes were bored to provide for several genera, the holes not needed for any tune being closed by plugs or rotating rings.
In a few cases wind instruments are found so long that the player’s

arm is too short to reach the lower end. ‘Then, necessarily, the holes to be fingered are located at the middle or upper end of the tube, but the holes are so small that the pitch of the resulting notes is much lower than the position of the holes would suggest, so the discrepancy’ to the ear is not as great as to the eye. In other cases the length is misleading, for the holes are bered obliquely or holes are bored in the tube below the holes to be fingered, thereby raising and adjusting the pitch of the lowest note, as Mahillon shows in the Brussels catalogue (Nos. 830, 1039, 1117, 1119, and 1123) and Villoteau shows on his Plate cc, No. 1. This is a possible explanation of the superfluous holes in the flute on the statue from the ruins of Susa (Plate 2, fig. 1), if the figure be accepted as archeologically correct. In modern instruments, as is well known, the distant holes are controlled by covers at the ends of long levers.
The relation of the instruments of the resonator type to the hand is too obvious to need discussion; the objects must be of such size and shape as to be held by the hand or by two hands while the fingers are manipulated, and the holes must be conveniently located and small enough to be closed by the tips of the fingers, or in the Chinese //wen also by the thumbs.
It is rather surprising to see how little the thumb is used in playing upon the instruments under consideration. Although from its anatomical structure the thumb has a peculiar independence in its movements, yet most of its Services are rendered by cooperation with the other fingers; and the natural training of these, as in grasping, sewing, weaving, or the most delicate savage industries, appears likewise to call for their cooperation, not for independent action. It is only in playing instruments like the lyre and harp (whose tuning depends on principles outside the instrument, and so they do not belong to the present discussion) that one sees a grasping action requiring two or more fingers at once. But in the guitars, flutes, etc., under consideration, the thumb is constantly occupied in merely supporting the instrument, so any variation in the pitch of the sound can come only as the other fingers become independent in action. When we remember how difticult it is for a civilized piano-player or typewriter to-day to acquire a satisfactory independence in movement of all the fingers, especially of the third and fourth, and recall that the early instruction-books for the harpsichord required the use of but two fingers on each hand, we shall have a higher respect for the technique of primitive musicians, and shall not wonder that primitive wind instruments have so few holes. Presumably the index finger first gained independence, and then it marked a long advance when two fingers could act independently of one another. So the four-hole flute or resonator, requiring the action of two fingers from each hand, and giving a scale of five tones, is a monument commemorating an important stage both in the development of the hand and in the extension of musical resources.

Each of the instruments thus far examined is capable of furnishing several notes of approximately constant pitch, but the general principle before us may be embodied in composite instruments, where each note has its own vibrating body; thus
1. Various forms of harps and dulcimers show strings of regularly decreasing length; here, of course, difference of tension may nullify the scale due to the lengths. One form is shown on Plate 8.
2. Pan’s pipes are sometimes seen with regularly decreasing lengths; it is true that this regularity is not very common, but it is the only
principle of scale building (except
the Chinese cycle of fifths) yet recog-nizable in these primitive instruments. (Plate 9.)
3. Instruments of the bar type are found frequently in our orchestras and bands under various names, as xylophone; they are familiar in children’s toys and are widely distributed in savage and half-civilized lands under the names of marimba, balafong, harmonicon, ete. (Plate Sand fig. 8.) The law of the uniform bar is that the frequencies of vibration of a series of bars of the same material are proportional to the quotients of the thickness divided by the square of the length; the breadth is immaterial if it is uniform. So if one takes a series of uniform bars of the same thickness and regularly decreasing length he may obtain a series of ascending notes. Thus, let the first bar be 24 units long (for example 24 em.), the successive bars decreasing by one unit; the eighth bar will be 17 units long, and the fifteenth bar 10 units; the series of frequencies would then be as the reciprocals of the squares of 24, 23, etc., so giving to the ear a series of increasing intervals; with these proportions bar No. 8 would give the Octave of the first, but bar No. 15 would give the Twelfth of bar No. 8. The simplicity of the rule, however, frequently disappears, either because of variations in the thickness, as when a savage splits a bamboo stem and then cuts his bars so that the shorter ones are also thinner, or because of the attachment of lumps of wax or clay to the bars to tune them to some other instrument; or because of the hollowing of the center, as is done by modern Japanese; so at present one can not affirm that this

theoretical principle of scale determination is certainly and consciously embodied in any instrument anywhere; but some instruments in the National Museum and some drawings in books make the assumption seem plausible, that the primitive type of this instrument is a series of bars, supported at points about one-fifth or one-fourth of their length from their ends, and decreasing in length by equal linear amounts.
It is evident that these composite instruments are of minor importance in this study; but in the light of the theoretical laws here suggested perhaps travelers may learn something of the intention of a savage who cuts his Pandean pipes or bars to form a musical instrument.
There have now been considered all the types of instruments in which several notes of different pitch are produced from the same vibrating body—whether string, column of air, or mass of air.
(1a.) There have been found examples from various parts of the world of the intentional location of the stopping points of a vibrating string at equal linear distances; since with all stringed instruments the fingering will cause a slight increase of tension, the equivalent length of the string is less than the actual length.
(14.) There have been found numerous examples of wind instruments pierced with holes in one or two groups spaced at equal linear distances; since these holes are never sufficiently large to allow the air to flow through them with perfect freedom (unless in some Chinese flutes) the equivalent length of the vibrating column of air is greater than the actual distance from the mouthpiece to the hole.
(2.) There have been found instruments of the Marimba type with
bars of regularly decreasing lengths. _ (3.) There have been found many forms of instruments of the resonator type embodying a series of equal and similarly-located holes; in these, thickening the wall is equivalent acoustically to making the holes smaller; while locating the hole nearer the point where the vibrating air has its maximum change of density is equivalent to enlarging the hole.
Three simple laws give to the first approximation the scales of these several instruments, namely:
(1) The law of inverse lengths.
(2) The law of inverse squares of lengths.
(3) The law of the square roots of a series of numbers proportional to sums of diameters.
The first and second laws give scales whose intervals increase as the pitch rises; scales based on the third law have decreasing intervals. Some results are shown in a table in the appendix and graphically in Plate 10.

<<<Page: 661>>>

From these it is evident that whichever type of instrument one may take, there will be some intervals that very closely agree with intervals of our familiar scale. In a few cases this comes about because our scale is principally derived from the Greek theorists, who based
their scales on proportional string-lengths; so, if the unit of equal
distance on a simple guitar chances to be an aliquot part of the length of the string from the bridge to the nut, some of the resulting notes will belong to our scale. (However, the divisor must not have a prime factor greater than five.) But whatever the instrument, on any doctrine of chances, there will be some approximate coincidences; and these coincidences, as judged by the ear, will be found much closer and more numerous than when judged mathematically or graphically; for the training of modern musicians, as has often been recognized, not only allows but compels them to ignore deviations from their standard scale-—deviations amounting sometimes to more than half a semitone. So one is forced to conclude that the recognition, even by a musically educated ear, of a series of notes as agreeing substantially with our diatonic scale or with any other known scale, does not afford any adequate ground for judging of the principles underlying the series; in fact, the failure to note the deviation may prevent the recognition of the underlying principle.
The type Costa Rican four-hole whistle is the most striking example of a series agreeing closely with notes of our scale, yet based on an absolutely different principle; for the mean computed deviation from the piano intervals is only one-eighth of a semitone.
Further, the whole discussion makes it evident that the people who made and used these instruments, or any single type of them, had not that idea of a scale which underlies all our thinking on the subject, namely: A series either of tones or of intervals recognized as a standard, independent of any particular instrument, but to which every instrument must conform. Modern Europeans for the sake of harmony have nearly banished all scales but one, and seldom know by what rules the instruments are tuned to furnish this. But for these people the instrument is the primary thing, and to it the rule is applied, while the scale is a result, or a secondary thing; and the same rule applied a hundred times may possibly give a hundred different scales. Naturally one does not expect to find much concerted music among people in this stage of development.
The various rules discussed ~above may be united in a generic one, namely:
The primary principle in the making of musical instruments that yield a scale is the repetition of elements similar to the eye; the size, number, and location of these elements being dependent on the size of the hand and the digital expertness of the performer.
This principle shows itself in the occasional equal spaces on the neck

or table of a stringed instrument, and conspicuously in the series of holes on flutes and primitive oboes, while a sense of balance and symmetry added to the repetition appears in the two groups of holes on the flutes, etc., and especially in the resonators, and appears in a different way in the trapezoidal forms of dulcimers, Pan’s pipes, and marimbas. The pitch-determining elements are therefore primarily decorative. In fact no one can examine any collection of primitive wind instruments, or drawings of them, without beitig struck by the way in which the holes often cooperate in the decoration; while they are not found interfering with the artistic design (see fig. 3, page 430; Plate 2, figs. 1 and 2; Plate 3, fig. 2).
Simple decoration involving only repetition and symmetrical placing or grouping of similar parts is not only found among living primitive. peoples everywhere that musical instruments embodying a scale can be found, but is prehistoric. The prehistoric flutes are believed to come from the neolithic age, and the pottery from this age shows a multitude of geometrical designs, some of which are collected in Wilson’s Plates 19 and 20. The paleolithic age has furnished few geometrical designs and no flutes or many-holed resonators. In applying such decoration to the hollow bones of animals or human enemies, to the hollow reeds that Lucretius says whistle in the wind, or to gourds and simple pottery, nothing can be more natural than sometimes to perforate the walls and to get a several-toned musical instrument as the result. So although no conclusions regarding the mental operations of prehistoric man can be absolutely certain, one feels a strong conviction that, as with immature minds among us, art appealed first to the eye and later to the ear; that beauty of material form incidentally furnished series of sounds that could be repeated, and could give to the ear and the mind the idea of the definite leaps or steps that Aristoxenus, countless ages afterward, called the characteristic of music. (Of course rhythm in movement and in sound. are independent of the structure of an instrument.) Any influence that may have been exerted on the establishment of scales by the songs of birds, by the recognition of overtones in the sounds of the human voice, or by the production of harmonics on the horn must have been limited and trivial. The principle here presented is at any rate a vera causa, and explains facts hitherto unexplained; further, (1) it is extremely simple both in theory and practice; (2) it is flexible, allowing of multifarious results in practice; (3) it is suggested by prehistoric instruments, supported by the instruments of many living primitive peoples and repeatedly confirmed by its survival in several instruments of peoples in an advanced stage of musical culture.
It only remains to add, in order to prevent misunderstanding, that the principle here set forth never appears as the dominating one among peoples who are known to have had a theory of the scale. The Greek

<<<Page: 663>>>

theoretical scales, diatonic and nondiatonic, are doubtless its direct descendants, though at present it is not known what the influence was that so transformed them and made them depend on ratios, not on difference of lengths. Possibly the theory of numbers bewitched musicians then as it has sometimes since, though the converse speculation is a plausible one—that the recognized musical ratios gave a mystical meaning to numbers. It is curious to note that Aristoxenus had somehow got far enough to complain that flutes distort most of the intervals (p. 42, Mb.), and if his lost treatise on boring flutes should be found it might throw light on this history. The Arab ‘‘step by step” method is apparently a late descendant of the equal linear divisions, appearing after men had learned to recognize the equality of intervals as well as of spaces. But the Chinese cycle of fifths must be explained and determined on entirely different physical principles, and the various European scales as defined by theorists or rendered by the best violinists or fixed by good tuners, when properly examined, reveal elements as diverse as the elements of our language or our population. The principle in question is therefore presented only as the simplest, earliest, and most primitive principle of scale-building.

The laws briefly stated on page 437 for the several kinds of instruments discussed in the paper may be expressed more accurately by the following formule:
Let N = number of complete vibrations per second. 1 = length of string or column of air or bar. a = diameter of mouth-hole of resonator, corrected for thickness of wall. = ? = diameter of finger-holes of resonator, corrected for thickness of wall. n = number of finger-holes opened on resonator. ¢ = thickness of bar. a K = constant, depending on material and units of measurement.

Ki = 34,000 em.-sec., the velocity of sound in air.

These constants are sufficiently accurate for the general purposes of the anthropologist and musician. But the results should be expressed in musical terms. The French standard pitch, now adopted by the Piano Makers’ Association, gives A = 435 d. v., or C = 258.7 d. y., and the ratio for any interval of p piano semitones is 272. In most cases it is much more convenient to have intervals than ratios; and incomparably the most convenient unit of intervals is the piano semitone, of which 12 by definition make an octave; these can readily be grouped by anyone with slight musical knowledge into larger intervals, Thirds, etc., and the musical value of any whole number of them can instantly be found on a well-tuned piano.
Since the reduction of ratios to intervals can not ordinarily be done without logarithms, a short table has been calculated and is appended by the use of which the reduction may be done by inspection in most practical cases. This table gives the logarithm of every whole number from 1 to 40, and the product of these by 40, less one three-hundredth, together with the successive differences; these are in semitones; for the factor is so chosen that when the logarithm of the ratio 2:1 is multiplied by it the product will be 12, which is the number of semitones corresponding to the ratio of the octave. Much more elaborate tables, but without the column of differences, have been published by Prony and by Ellis. In using the table it is well to remember that the average uncertainty in pitch of public per-
formers in Berlin was found to be about one-tenth of a semitone.

As illustrations of the use of the table, find the successive intervals of the scale of the Hindu Sitar, the string being stopped successively at 36, 35, 34, . . 27; the corresponding differences in column 4 of the table are 0.49, .50, .52,... .63 E. §., the
sum being 4.98 E. S., as required by Tagore’s rule (p. 425 above). To complete the —
octave, the space 27 to 18 is to be divided into 13 equal parts; substitute for the ratio 27:18, or 3:2, 39:26, and use the table again; the differences are now 0.45, .46,.. . .65, the sum being 7.02 E.8., which added to.4.98 gives 12 E. 8., or the octave.
Tf the law be that of the square roots, as with resonators, the table is to be used in precisely the same way, but the final results are to be divided by 2; for example, in the type resonator, calling the equivalent radius of the mouth hole 1.0, that of the finger holes is 0.6 (more accurately, 0.62); the series of terms will therefore be 1.0, 1.6, 2.2, 2.8, 3.4; multiply all by 10, and take the corresponding numbers from column 3 of the table; divide the differences by 2, and add the quotients to the fundamental pitch. The results are as follows:
If 0.62 had been taken the results would have been slightly higher in pitch.
Plate 10 has been plotted to give directly the intervals of resonator scales for any number of open holes up to 5, and for ratios of radii between 0 and 1. The dotted line corresponds to the type resonator.
The table may also be used for bars; the only change is that the differences are to be doubled instead of halved. Thus, witha series of uniform bars whose lengths are 24, 23, etc., to 17, the compass will be 2 x (55.02 — 49.05) = 11.94 E. 8., which is practically an octave, as stated on page 436.

The construction of this chart has been explained in the appendix. To use it, find in the base line the number which expresses the radius of the finger holes, that of the mouth hole being considered 1.0, and erect a perpendicular therefrom; the heights of the points of intersection with the successive curves, measured on the left-hand scale, give the pitch of the successive notes produced as the holes 1, 2, 3, ete., are opened, expressed in equally tempered semitones, E. 8. The dotted line corresponds to the position on the chart of the type resonator. The chart shows clearly how the successive intervals become smaller as the number of open holes increases, and how the total compass is small if the finger holes are relatively small. .
Use may be made of the chart for many ready calculations of intervals other than those due to equal differences, and by doubling the readings in E. §. the result may be applied to string ratios; e. g., find the interval corresponding to the ratio 5:4, or 1+-0.25; the chart gives directly 1.9; the double of whichis3.8 E.8. The table in the appendix gives more accurately 3.86 E. 8., showing that the just Third is 0.14 E. 8. flatter than the piano Third.

By Water Hoven, Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnology.
Some years ago Mr. A. M. Stephen made for Dr. Washington Matthews, U.S. A., a collection of Hopi Indian ceremonial pigments, with notes on their preparation, derivation, and uses. These valuable notes from that most excellent observer were brought together by Dr. Matthews and presented to the International Folk-Lore Congress held at Chicago in 1893, and later were published under Mr. Stephen’s name in the report of the congress, which appeared in 1898."
Through the liberality of Dr. Matthews, the series of paints, comprising about twenty-five specimens, is now in the national collection. Determinations of the paints have been made by Mr. Wirt -Tassin, assistant curator of the division of minerals. With the addition of the pigments secured from the Hopi, many years ago, by Maj. J. W. Powell and James Stevenson, together with those gathered among the Navajo by Dr. Matthews, this unique collection becomes of great importance and interest.
The Hopi are assiduous collectors. A catalogue of the substances brought to their pueblos from long distances would awaken surprise, and the diverse materials gleaned from a region so unpromising in appearance would increase the wonder. Every house is a museum of the environment, with specimens from the mineral, animal, and vegetal kingdoms, and every Hopi is a repository of knowledge as to the places where materials may be secured. Time and distance are little thought of when it comes to procuring the materials desired. For this reason the pigments and dyes, when compared with those employed by other American Indian tribes, are remarkable for their number as well as for the diversity of their origin. The colors range over the whole spectrum and furnish a number of shades and tints, as anyone may observe on looking through the large collections of Hopi objects
‘The International Folk-Lore Congress of the World’s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, July, 1893. Archives International Folk-Lore Association, I, pp. 260-265. Chicago, 1898.

<<<Page: 709>>>

in the United States National Museum, the Field Columbian Museum, and the Peabody Museum.
The region where the Hopi live is remarkable for its natural colors, which are displayed in marvelous profusion and brilliancy in the bad lands, known as the Painted Desert. The love of color might well arise from the tints of the native corn, on which the Hopi principally depend for nourishment. This corn presents a variety of beautiful colors, sufficient to represent the six regions, and for this purpose it is used in the ceremonies. The same observation applies to the multifarious varieties of Hopi beans.
The Hopi apparently do not discriminate indigo, blue, and green; at least, they do not have separate words to describe these colors. Violet is classed with the red; orange is not differentiated from yellow orred. Thus, as has been observed among primitive peoples, the Hopi recognize the primary colors and have given them names. Probably primitive man could see only the primary colors, a reasonable hypothesis from the survival of these terms, but in the present culture stage of the Hopi it must not be inferred that they lack practical knowledge of all the spectrum colors.
Abstract terms helong far above the Hopi plane of culture, hence it is found that the term for a color denotes some object having the color. Frequently the name of a pigment refers to the place of its origin or to the use to which it is to be put, or, if a compound, to the principal constituent.
While the Hopi appreciate color, their applications of it are crude and inartistic, the tendency being to barbaric gaudiness. It may be noted that in the Hopi dwellings almost no colors are applied for decoration, the band of red ocher sometimes painted on the walls of a room near the floor being a modern innovation. One remarks also that the Hopi costume is plain, the weaver producing only stuffs of white, dark blue, or brown, without patterns, except in belts and hair tapes, and in garments of a ceremonial character. The leather for moccasins may be dyed according to individual fancy, and in the brilliant shoulder scarfs of cotton print a riot of color is allowable, but the costume without these recent additions is sober and relieved only by ornaments of shell and turquoise.
Of articles in common use pottery shows two colors, a red and a dark brown, and baskets present several colors. These articles, however, are ceremonial in decoration and to a large extent as to use, and‘as they are buried with the dead it would seem that the symbolic ornamentation has some deeper meaning than that of mere ornament.
The use of pigments among the Hopi is then confined to that large element in Hopi life, ceremony, and colors are displayed in profusion on the paraphernalia of their complex religion.
The Hopi apply color with meaning, if not with art, and these

<<<Page: 710>>>

meanings are many. The colors emblematic of the regions constantly occur in Hopi painting and present an interesting phase of their beliefs as set forth by Mr. Stephen.
The Hopi orientation bears no relation to north and south, but to the points on his horizon which mark the places of sunrise and sunset at the summer and winter solstices. He invariably begins his ceremonial circuit by pointing (1) to the place of sunset at summer solstice, then to (2) the place of sunset at winter solstice, then to (3) the sunrise at winter solstice, and (4) the summer solstice, next to (5) the above, and (6) the below. :
The names of these directions and their emblematic colors are as follows:
1. Kwi-ni-wi; yellow, because the anthropomorphic deity who sits there is yellow, wearing a yellow cloud as a mask which covers his head and rests upon his shoulders; a multitude of yellow butterflies constantly flutter before the cloud, and yellow corn grows continually in that yellow land.
Similar phenomena are manifest at all the other directions, only of different colors, thus:
. Té-vylifi-a, Blue. Ta-tytik-a, Red. H6-po-ko, White. Omi, Black.
6. At-kya-mi, all colors, and here sits the deity regarded as the maker of all life germs. He sits upona flowery mound on which grows all vegetation; he is speckled with all the colors, as also is his cloud mask, and before it flutter all the butterflies and all the sacred birds.!
ote go
The prayer offerings called Paho, of most of the ceremonies, are painted green, the color of vegetation, a frequent Hopi supplication being for abundant crops. One set of the Pahos of the Ninian Katcina ceremony are painted yellow, and are said to be a supplication for flowers. Red is the color of the warrior, who also rubs his face with powdered charcoal and sprinkles it with micaceous iron ore, when he desires to represent the Twin War-Gods.
The different ceremonies have prescribed uses of certain colors in costume, paraphernalia, and bodily decoration of the priests, and the **dolls” and other representations of the beings of the spirit world are painted in traditional colors.”
In passing, attention may be called to the ceremonial sand painting of the Hopi and Navajo, where the most beautiful effects are secured by allowing sand in slender streams of different colors to fall from the hand guiding it over the surface to form designs. The blending of the colored sands is soft and harmonious, and the result is a sand mosaic.°

Hopi display in applying pigments is remarkable. This art is altogether the province of the men, on whom the preparation of the elaborate paraphernalia falls. The accuracy of the drawing and, in many cases, the quality of the lines, are worthy of praise, and seem beyond the simple brush made of a narrow strip of yucca leaf. In fact, the skill displayed is little less than that observed in the Mexican codices, as the set of drawings of Hopi Katcinas prepared by a native for Dr. J. Walter Fewkes amply evidences.
The purity of the natural colors laid on by the Hopi artists gives their work a character like that of Egyptian paintings. It will be seen by examination that colors are laid on in mass usually to define forms and that the background is not intended to enter into the design. It is important to bear this in mind in the study of Hopi symbolism.
While some colors are applied dry and rubbed in as on feathers and the tanned leather of moccasins in the manner of the Plains tribes, the customary method is to use as a medium water or the fatty substance of squash, melon, pifion, or other seeds. The latter medium is procured by chewing the seeds and mixing the saliva with the paint. In a few vases the albumen from the eggs of the eagle is used as a medium. With these mediums the colors have little permanence, and the refurbishing of paraphernalia is usually required for each ceremony.
The Hopi artist applies his colors with a yucca brush or with the hand. The green paint, made by heating together pifion gum and powdered carbonate of copper, says Mr. Stephen, is rubbed down on a paint muller moistened with saliva charged with chewed squash seeds, then transferred to the mouth by means of a corn husk, and spurted over the surface of a mask. }
Paint mortars of stone, sometimes a slightly concave stone and sometimes an elaborately worked-out utensil of good shape, are found in use among the Hopi. Paint vessels of pottery are found, though they are not so common as at Zufi. Some of the massive paint materials are used as a muller on the slab, the paint being ground from the muller as needed, like India ink. Other paints are pulverized and washed with water, and some of the materials are soft enough to be used in the natural state or need very little manipulation.
Face paint, generally red, is carried in bits of skin pursed to form a bag. Face painting, except in ceremonies, is uncommon among the Hopi, and never employed at the East Mesa. At the Middle Mesa and Oraibi the practice is sometimes observed. Commonly one notices persons having patches of kaolin daubed on the skin, but no reason has been given for this custom.
From the processes described by Mr. Stephen in the following catalogue it will be seen that the Hopi exercise considerable skill in the preparation of a number of their colors, especially those of organic substances. In one case pifion gum is employed, as a medium like var-

<<<Page: 712>>>

nish, and in two cases lakes are produced by complicated processes involving the use of alum. The Hopi also know the value of alum as a mordant, this substance being derived from an impure alum-bearing
clay. CATALOGUE.
1. Ca kwa’pi ki, ‘‘ green bread” (artificial), 175682. Ca kwa’pi ki is thus made:
About ten ounces of pifon gum is put in an earthern pot and set on the fire, a very little water being poured in to keep it from burning and it is then allowed to roast. A large basin is set conveniently with about a gallon of water in it, and over this basin a yucca sieve is laid, and in the sieve a quantity of horse hair, or shredded yucca fiber. After the gum has melted and boiled for about ten minutes it is poured upon the hair lying in the sieve and allowed to strain through into the water, where it accumulates in a white mass. The operator then puts about three ounces of fragments of blue and green copper carbonate into a small muller and rubs them into a pulp, then pours a little water in the muller and rubs the pulp into a liquid. Hethen turns to the gum, which is stiff but still pliable, and after kneading and stretching it back and forth, doubling and twisting and pulling, it becomes soft and of glistening whiteness. After manipulating the gum for about a quarter of an hour, he folds it up compactly, dips it lightly in the blue-pulp liquid, and puts it back in the roasting pot, which has been filled with water, and sets it on the fire to boil. As the water heats, the gum melts, and just before it comes to a boil he pours in all the blue-pulp liquid, then, as the mixture boils he maintains a constant stirring with a long rod. He dips up some of the mass from time to time on the rod to examine its color, and the longer it boils the darker it grows, and after abouttwenty minutes he takes the jar off the fire, pours off the hot water and poursin some cold. He then takes the bluegreen mass out, and works it around in his hands, forming a cake of about eight ounces."
2. Kii tcate’ka, ‘‘ white clay,” clay; Navajo hlej, or glec. 175683. This clay, which is valued by Hopi potters, isin general use as a ceremonial paint for the body.
3. Ko ho ni ni ci’ ta. 175684. Probably hematite ground and worked up with water. The Hopi obtain this pigment from the Kohonini country in Cataract Canyon, 110 miles west of the reservation. The color is symbolic of the northwest region. Its use is most marked in the paraphernalia of the Snake Society.
4. Ciip na la, Si bibse, berriesof sumac (Rhus trilobata). Artificial.
Ciip’ na la—red paint, made as follows:
Three ears of dark purple corn are shelled and the kernels put in an earthen pot, in which are about three pints of water, and the pot is set on the fire to boil. About a quart of dried sumac berries are put in a basin, over which a yucca sieve is laid. The corn having boiled about three-quarters of an hour, the pot is taken from the fire and its contents poured upon the sieve, through which the purple-stained boiling water is strained upon the sumac berries. Some of the talc-like substance, called potato-clay is then produced, and the operator puts a piece about the size of a walnut in his mouth, chewing it a little to soften it. The berries and
hot water having now cooled sufficiently, he spits out the clay into his hands which
‘A. M. Stephen, Pigments in Ceremonials of the Hopi, p. 263.

<<<Page: 713>>>

are dipped among the berries, and these and the clay he rubs thoroughly between his hands in the water. He continues chewing bits of clay and spitting them among the berries, rubbing and squeezing them until by repeated tests upon the skin he obtains the desired tint, which is usually a hue of lake. The mixture is now ready for use, or it may be dried and used at a future time by again moistening with water.!
5. Ya la’ ha. 175686. Hematite, with clay. Face paint, in ceremonies. This is the sacred paint of the warrior fraternity. It is often found buried with the dead in the ancient ruins.
6. Pa l’a’te ka. Red ocherous, earthy, hematite. 175687.
7. Owa’k ta la’ si, *S stone pollen.” 175688. Yellow clay, resembling in color the pollen used in ceremonies. Dr. Fewkes has stated that the word for pollen, ta la si, means flower of the sun, symbolizing the belief that the light of the sun is sprinkled on the earth, fructifying it as with pollen.
8. Ti mi’n teii’ka, clay. 175689.
The name means sandy clay. It is collected under the mesas.
9. Ca’ kwa, ‘‘ green.” Copper carbonate, composed of malachite and azurite. 175690. The Hopi collect this paint 110 miles west of the reservation in Cataract Canyon. It is used for painting Pahos, masks, figurines, etc. Frequently found in graves in the ancient ruins.
10. Siufa. Glauber salt (mirabilite). 175691.
The name means ‘‘salt flower.” Its use has not been ascertained.
11. Sikya’ pi ki, ‘‘ yellow bread.” 175692.
Sikyapiki, ‘‘ bright yellow paint,” is thus prepared by some old, expert priest.

By Wrart Tassin,
Assistant Curator, Division of Mineralogy.
A gem mineral may be defined as a mineral of any sort distinguished, especially when cut and polished, for its beauty, durability, or rarity.
The essentials, beauty and durability, are dependent upon the color, brilliancy, and hardness of the stone, and these in turn are dependent upon certain chemical and physical properties characteristic of any one kind of mineral as compared with all other kinds of minerals. A detailed description of all these properties is to be found in any textbook of mineralogy, so that a discussion of them here will be limited to those that will afford a more or less ready means of distinguishing one kind of gem from another or upon which their beauty largely depends. These several properties are:
Color.—The character of the color in any one kind of gem is not a constant, and may vary within rather wide limits. The garnet, for example, which popularly is supposed to be a blood or purplish red stone, varies through red of several shades to brown, black, green, yellow, and nearly white. The color depends upon the power of absorbing certain portions of light and reflecting others—that is, absorbing certain rays of the spectrum that pass through or fall upon its surface. Thus a gem appears red because it absorbs all other colors and reflects, or transmits chiefly the reds; a gem appears green because it reflects, or transmits chiefly green rays, absorbing all others. In all cases the color results from the constituents of the light which have not been absorbed. Those which reflect or transmit all the colors in the proportions in which they exist in the spectrum and absorb none are white; those which absorb all and reflect or transmit none are black. Between these two limits there is an infinite variety of hues, according to the greater or less extent to which substances reflect or transmit some colors and absorb others.

<<<Page: 724>>>

Among minerals the many varieties of color are classed, first, as metallic and nonmetallic, and all shades are referred to eight fundamental colors—white, gray, black, blue, green, yellow, red, and brown; second, according to peculiarities in the arrangement of color, as play of color, opalescence, iridescence, and asterism; third, as to difference in color shown for light transmitted in different directions through the stone. This case of color absorption is called pleochroism and is peculiar to certain minerals.
Diaphaneity.—The capacity of transmitting light materially affects the beauty and value of gems. There is a wide difference in the degree of this property possessed by most gems and the amount of light transmitted, or the degree of transparency is classed as transparent when the outline of an object seen through the stone is perfectly distinct; subtransparent when an object may be seen but its outline is indistinct; translucent when light is transmitted but objects are not seen; subtranslucent when merely the edges are translucent; opaque when no light is transmitted. | —
Luster.—This is that character depending upon the power and manner of reflecting light and is dependent upon the nature of the reflecting surface and the quantity or the intensity of the light reflected. The kinds of luster are described as metallic, the brilliant appearance seen upon the surface of polished metal; adamantine, the luster of the diamond; vitreous, having the luster of flint glass; resinous, having the appearance seen upon the surface of pine resin; waxy, the luster of beeswax; greasy, when resembling that of a freshly oiled surface; pearly, the luster of mother-of-pearl; silky, when having a sheen like that of silk. The degrees of intensity are splendent, shining, glistening, glimmering, and dull. There being no standard of description in regard to luster, these terms are loosely used and intermediate ones may be substituted in describing a particular kind of luster according to the judgment of the observer. |
Refraction of light.—The familiar case of the apparent breaking of an oar where it enters the water is an illustration of the bending back or refraction of light. This phenomenon occurs in the majority of cases where a ray of light passes obliquely from one transparent medium to another. Part of the incident ray enters the medium and changes its direction, or is refracted.
For example, if in fig. 1 ao is a ray of light passing from air into water, its path will be changed after passing the surface at 0 and it will continue in the direction ob. Conversely, if a ray of light, do, pass from the denser medium, water, at o, it will take the direction oa. Now, if yow is a perpendicular to the surface, ww, at 0, it will be seen that the angle avy, called the angle of incidence (7) of the ray, ao, is greater than the angle box, called the angle of refraction (7), and what is observed in this case is found to be universally true. Again, how-

<<<Page: 725>>>

CATALOGUE OF GEMS. 48% ever great or small the angle of incidence may be, there is always a constant relation between it and the angle of refraction for two given substances.. This constant relation is the ratio between the sines of the incident and refracted angle, and is called the ¢ndex of refraction.
When a ray of light passes from one medium into another which is less refracting, as from water into air, the angle of incidence is less than the angle of refraction. Hence when light is propagated in a mass of water there is always a value of the angle of incidence such that the angle of refraction is a right angle, in which case the refracted ray emerges parallel to the surface of the water. This angle is called the critical angle, since for any greater angle the incident ray can not emerge, but undergoes an internal reflection, which is called total reflection because the incident light is entirely reflected. From water to air the critical angle is 48° 35’. In the example given, air and water, 7 = 48° 35’.. Now, supposing the light to go from 4} to 0, the line oe will coincide with the line of (the critical angle). If the value of 7 is increased, the ray will no longer pass from water into air, but undergoes total reflection at the surface o.
In total reflection there is no loss of light from absorption or transmission, and accordingly it produces the greatest brilliancy. The luster of transparent bodies bounded by plane surfaces, such as the luster of gems, arises mainly from total reflection. This luster is the more frequent and the more brilliant the smaller the limiting angle. The diamond, having the smallest value for its limiting angle, is the most brilliant of all gems.
There are certain transparent substances

iar example of this is furnished by the
mineral calcite. If efyh (fig. 2) be a cleavage piece of calcite and a ray of light meets it at 0, it will in passing through be divided into two rays, oc, od, one of which follows the ordinary law of refraction, the other a more complicated law. Similarly, a line seen through a piece of calcite ordinarily appears double. This phenomenon is called double refraction. The diamond, garnet, and all other minerals belonging to the isometric system are singly refracting. The ruby, topaz,
Fig. 1. DIAGRAM TO ILLUSTRATE REFRACTION.
Fig. 2.

<<<Page: 726>>>

and all minerals belonging to systems of crystallization other than the isometric are doubly refracting.
Dispersion of Vight.—W hen a ray of light passing from one medium to another is refracted, it may be decomposed into several kinds of light, separated more or less widely from each other and differently colored. A familiar example of this is seen when a beam of sunlight passes through a flint-glass prism and produces a band of colors in all the hues of the rainbow. This decomposition of light by refraction is called dispersion. Upon it depends that peculiar quality of ‘‘fire” or play of prismatic hues in gems, a marked characteristic in the diamond and zircon.
Polarization of light.—The light which passes through a doubly refracting crystal undergoes a peculiar change. A ray of light which has been once split by passing through a doubly refracting substance will not again be divided on passing through another doubly refracting substance, nor can it again be reflected at a certain angle, nor again traverse in a certain direction the substance in which it has sutffered this change. Light which has acquired these properties is said to be polarized.
Pleochroism.—TVhis is the variation in color observed in doubly refracting minerals when viewed in different directions. This property is conspicuous in the tourmaline, iolite, chrysoberyl, and epidote. The pleochroism of gems can best be observed with the aid of an instrument called the dichroscope.
This consists of an oblong rhombohedron of Iceland spar, at the extremities of which is cemented a glass prism of 18°. This is contained in a cylindrical metal case having a convex lens at one end and a square opening at the other. On looking through the lens the square opening appears double. When a pleochroic gem is examined in transmitted light with this instrument, the two squares on a revolution will be found to have different colors at certain intervals.
Phosphorescence.—The emission of light or phosphorescence may be produced in different ways; by rise of temperature, by mechanical effect, and by insolation—that is, by exposure to the direct action of sunlight. Phosphorescence is a property possessed by some gems, notably the diamond.
Hardness.—This is the degree of resistance the mineral offers to abrasion. It is usually referred to an arbitrary scale of ten minerals showing a regular gradation in hardness from 1, tale, the softest; 2, gypsum; 3, calcite; 4, fluorite; 5, apatite; 6, orthoclase; 7, quartz; 8, topaz; 9, corundum, to 10, diamond, the hardest. The scale is used as follows: Fragments of the minerals comprising the scale are applied in succession to the stone under examination. Should the test stone ~ neither scratch nor be scratched by a particular unit in the scale, the hardness of the two are the same. Should the test piece scratch one

<<<Page: 727>>>

and be scratched by the next number of the scale above it, its hardness is somewhere between the two units.
The property of hardness is an essential in gem stones, since upon it depend its capabilities of receiving and retaining a high degree of polish and of resisting wear from abrasion. It is also often an available method of identifying a gem. In testing cut stones, however, care must be taken not to disfigure them, and, if possible, the girdle, or the part hid by the mount, should be used as the test surface. Furthermore, the term ‘‘ hardness” must not be confused with toughness or difficulty of breakage. A very hard stone may be a very brittle or fragile one. Hardness means simply hability or nonliability to scratch.
Specific gravity.—This is the density of a body compared with that of distilled water at a certain temperature (commonly at 60° F.).
The determination of specific gravity is in principle very simple. The substance is at first weighed in air, then in water; divide the weight in air by the loss of weight in water, and the quotient is the specific gravity. Thus if a gem weighs 5 grams in air and only 3 in water, it is evident that it has displaced 2 grams of water, and its specific gravity is 2.5.
In order to get absolute results, very delicate
ul SOAS
. —_ balances have to be used and many precautions == taken, but for ordinary work such care is not ————=? necessary. a
® . . % A very convenient specific-gravity apparatus Y y
that is sufficiently close for ordinary use is the Nicholson hydrometer (fig. 3). This consists of a float having a descending hook, to which is hung a pan to hold the substance weighed in water. A wire stem supports a cup on which the weights and the substance weighed in air are placed. A mark on the stem shows the point at which the whole apparatus will float in a vessel of water when a certain known weight (called the balance weight) is placed in the weight cup. The specimen under examination must not exceed in weight that of the balance weight, this being the limit of the apparatus. Suppose the limit to be 100 grams. Then to find the specific gravity of a substance, place it on the weight pan and add weights until the instrument sinks to the mark. The difference between the added weight and 100 is the weight of the specimen in air. Then place the specimen in the lower pan; as much more weight on the weight pan will now be required as corresponds to the weight of a bulk of water equal to that of the specimen. The difference of weight
ig. 3.

<<<Page: 728>>>

thus found will be the divisor of the weight of the specimen and the quotient will be the specific gravity. Thus:
The substance is placed in the weight cup.
The limit of the apparatus is... ..... = ----252 e— eae 100. 00 Weight added to sink instrument to mark oo 2s 263252 Se eee eee 29 50) Weight of specimen in air is then-.... 2... 2.282 ee wie50 Specimen placed in lower pan requires, to sink instrument. to mark, the weight...........----2-22 = 2+ eee eee 35. 50
Now, 35.50—22.50=13, the weight of a like bulk of water. Then 77.50+13=—5.9615, the specific gravity sought.
The specific gravity test is one of the most important and reliable means of identifying a gem, since it is practically a constant for all individuals of the same ean while the difference between perecuals
of different kinds is often considerable. Thus:

Further, if the specific gravities of two substances are known, by taking the specific gravity of their compound the relative weights of the components may be found. Thus, having the weight of a diamond and gold ring we can find the weight of the diamond.
Let A be the weight of the stone, a its specific gravity; B be the weight of the gold, b its specific gravity; C be the weight of the ring, ¢ its specific gravity:
Then A + B = Cand A Bac
a D c (c-b) a
From which we obtain A = C (a-b) ¢
Llectricity.—The electrical properties of minerals are distinguished by the following terms: Frictional electricity, pyroelectricity, and thermoelectricity. Of these we have to do only with frictional electricity, or the power of becoming electrified by friction, and as a result attracting or repelling certain substances. This property is especially noticeable in the topaz, tourmaline, and amber.
Cleavage.—This is that tendeney of a mineral to break in the direction of minimum cohesion, and that direction is always parallel to some plane which occurs or may occur in the crystal. The cleavage is characterized, first, according to direction, that is, when parallel to certain faces or planes; second, according to the ease with which it may be obtained, as perfect, imperfect, interrupted, or difficult.
/racture. —Vhis is that surface obtained by breaking the mineral in a direction other than that of the cleavage. It may be designated as conchoidal, that is, breaking with cavities more or less deep; even, when the fracture approximates a plane surface; uneven, when the surface is irregular; hackly or splintery, when the surface is jagged.

Form.—The external form of a gem mineral may be described as: A—crystallized, B—crystalline, and C—amorphous.
A—Crystallized: When made up of geometrical solids, any individual polyhedral form of which is called a crystal. Crystals are bounded by plain surfaces called planes or faces, symmetrically arranged with reference to one or more imaginary ‘diametral lines called axes.
Crystals, though their forms and modifications are of an idefinite number, are classified under six systems according to the number and character of their axes. The systems of crystallization and typical examples occurring under each are:
Isometric.
Examples: Cube, octahedron, and dodecahedron. Tetragonal.
Examples: Square prism and square octahedron. Hexagonal.
Examples: Hexagonal prisms, pyramids, and rhombohedrons. Orthorhombic.
Examples: Right prism.on a rhombic base and a rhombic octahedron. Monoclinic.
Examples: Oblique prisms on a rectangular base and oblique octahedron on
a rhombic base.
Triclinie.
‘xamples: Doubly oblique prism and doubly oblique octahedron or pyramid.
L—Crystalline: When the mass appears to be made up of closely compacted, minute crystals. The individuals composing crystalline masses may be: In columns or fibers, in which case the structure is columnar; in thin laminae, plates, or leaves, giving rise to a lamellar structure; in grains, producing a granular structure. Further, there are numerous irregular and accidental groupings of the individuals composing the mass, giving to it certain shapes, such as globular, botryoidal, reniform, dendritic, ete., which are too numerous to allow of a specification here. These indeterminate forms are grouped under the head of ‘‘imitative shapes.”
(—Amorphous: Finally, the mass may be entirely destitute of crystalline structure or imitative shape and show neither external nor internal signs of crystallization. Such a mass is said to be amorphous.
Albite occurs in opaque to transparent masses and in triclinic crystals having a cleavage in two directions, one of which is highly perfect. The mineral has a hardness of 6; a specific gravity of 2.62, and a vitreous luster, often pearly on a cleavage surface. Color white, also

bluish, grayish, reddish, greenish, and green, occasionally having a bluish chatoyancy or play of color.
The use of this mineral for gem purposes is practically restricted to those kinds showing a bluish opalescence or play of colors, or an aventurine effect, or which give a moonstone effect when cut cabochon. Prominent among the kinds affording gem material are: Peristerite, a whitish adularia-like albite presenting a bluish chatoyancy, usually more or less mixed with pale green and yellow, the play of color resembling that on the neck of a pigeon; hence the name, from mepiotepa, pigeon. Aventurine, a grayish white to reddish gray albite with internal fire-like reflections proceeding from minute disseminated occluded crystals. J/oonstone, a transparent albite having a chatoyant reflection resembling that of a cat’s eye, or an opaque pearly white albite having a bluish opalescence.
Albite is a constituent of many crystalline rocks and often replaces common feldspar as a constituent of granite, and is frequently a constituent of syenite and greenstone; in other instances it is associated with feldspar and dolomite. Some of the most common occurrences are in veins or cavities in granite or granitoid rocks, such veins being then frequently repositories of fine crystals of other gem minerals, such as beryl, tourmaline, smoky quartz, etc.
One hundred parts of albite contain: Silica, 68.7; alumina, 19.5;
oda, 11.8. AMBER.
A foss'l resin occurring in irregular masses without cleavage and having a conchoidal fracture. Color yellow, sometimes reddish, brownish, and whitish, often clouded, and occasionally fluorescent, exhibiting a peculiar blue or green tinge. Hardness 2 to 2.5; brittle. Specific gravity 1.05 to 1.09. Luster resinous to waxy. ‘Transparent to opaque. Negatively electrified by friction. It burns readily with a rich yellow flame and aromatic odor; heated to 150° C. it begins to soften and finally melts at about 250° C., giving off dense white fumes having an irritating aromatic odor. It is soluble in alcohol.
Amber contains in 100 parts: Carbon, 78.96; hydrogen, 10.51; oxygen, 10.52.
Andalusite has but a limited use as a gem. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic system commonly in coarse prismatic forms, the prisms often nearly square; occurring also massive, columnar, radiated, and granular. The color varies froma reddish or greenish brown to olive green, flesh red, rose red, violet, and pearl gray; pleochroism strong in some colored varieties, green in one direction and hyacinth to rose-

<<<Page: 731>>>

red in another. Luster, vitreous, often weak. Hardness, 7.5, somewhat greater than that of quartz; brittle. Specific gravity, age, prismatic and distinct; often perfect.
The variety chiastolite, or macle, varies in hardness from 5 to 7.5 due to the presence of impurities, which, in part, are arranged symmetrically about the axes of the crystal so as to give a tessellated appearance in cross section.
Andalusite contains: Silica, 37; alumina, 63.
re 3.2: cleav-
Anhydrite, anhydrous sulphate of lime, has a hardness of 3.5, a specific gravity of 2.9, and a vitreous to pearly luster. Color, white, grayish, bluish, reddish; also brick red and blue. Anhydrite has been variously denominated muriacite, anhydrite, and tripe stone, according to its structure; the first, when crystallized in broad lamellae: the second, when granular, and the third, when composed of contorted plates. Vulpinite is a siliceous variety containing 8 per cent of silica and is the kind most used for ornamental purposes. The use of any of the varieties is limited. Anhydrite contains 41.2 parts of lime and 58.8 parts of sulphuric acid in 100.
Apophyllite is occasionally cut for gem purposes.
The hardness of the mineral is below 5; its specific gravity is 2.33; its color varies from white to gray, occasionally tinged with green, pink, or yellow. It crystallizes in the tetragonal system, usually in octahedrons having their solid angles truncated. The faces thus formed have a decided pearly luster, the others vitreous. Apophyllite was so named in allusion to its tendency to exfoliate under the blowpipe. Its pearly luster, producing an effect like that of a fish’s eye, gave rise to the name **fish-eye stone,” or ichthyophthalmite.
Apophyllite occurs commonly as a secondary mineral in basalt and related rocks associated with datolite, pectolite, and the several zeolites. One hundred parts contain: Silica, 52.7; lime, 26; potash, 4.4; water, 16.7. There is also a variable proportion of fluorine present which probably bears no relation to the compound.
Crystals of axinite are occasionally cut for ornamental use. Axinite crystallizes in the triclinic system, commonly in broad, acute-edged, wedge-shaped forms, occurring also massive. The hardness of the mineral is about 7, or near that of quartz, but it is so extremely brittle that it is fashioned only with difficulty. Luster, vitrecus.

<<<Page: 732>>>

Transparent to subtranslucent. Specific gravity, 3.27. Color, clove brown, plum blue, violet, pearl gray, and honey yellow to greenish yellow. It is usually strongly pleochroic, pale olive-green specimens giving, with the dichroscope, olive-green and violet-blue images.
The composition of axinite in 100 parts is approximately: Silica, 43; boron trioxide, 5; alumina, 16; ferric oxide, 10; manganese oxide, 3; potash, 1; lime, 20; magnesia, 2.
The use of the two carbonates of copper as gems is limited by their softness and opacity. Their hardness is 4; their specific gravity varies from 3.5 to 4, and they possess a vitreous to adamantine luster, occasionally silky. Malachite is a bright green in color, varying somewhat in tint and usually in veinings or markings. Azurite shows the various shades of azure passing into Berlin blue. Botryoidal masses of these carbonates occur in which the two minerals are in alternate concentric layers, giving rise to a very pleasing effect.
Malachite contains: Copper oxide, 71.9; carbon dioxide, 19.9; water, 8.2. Azurite contains: Copper oxide, 69.2; carbon dioxide, 25.6; water, 5.2. (Plate 1.)
Barite can hardly be regarded as a gem stone, its softness permitting rapid abrasion. Its hardness does not exceed 3.5; its specific
gravity is 4.3 to 4.7, depending upon the amount of impurity present. -
Its color ranges between white, gray, blue, red, or brown; the colors occasionally banded or mottled. Luster vitreous, sometimes pearly. One hundred parts contain: Baryta, 65.59; sulphuric acid, 34.33.
The beryl crystallizes in six-sided hexagonal prisms, usually long prismatic and often having the prism faces more or less deeply striated vertically. The specific gravity of the transparent flawless beryl is 2.73; usually 2.69 to 2.70. Hardness 7.5 to 8. Brittle. Cleavage indistinct. Fracture uneven to conchoidal. Luster vitreous, occasionally resinous. The colors of the beryl include emerald green passing into pale green, and pale blue, pale yellow, honey, wine, and citrine yellow, white, to a pale-rose-red. The pleochroism is more or less distinct; occasionally strong, especially in the emerald which, when viewed across the prism with the dichroscope, shows two different shades of green.
Mineralogically the beryl includes the emerald, aquamarine, goshenite, and davidsonite. The general composition, fundamental crystalline form, hardness, and specific gravity of all the varieties are essentially the same, the difference being primarily one of color. The

emerald includes the rich green colored kinds only. It is a highly prized gem when of a bright emerald green color, clear, and free from flaws.
The aquamarine includes those beryls showing clear shades of sky blue and sea green. Goshenite is a white or colorless variety from Goshen, Massachusetts. Davidsonite is a greenish yellow beryl from near Aberdeen, Scotland. Other varieties are: Aeroides, pale sky blue; hyacinthozontes, clear sapphire blue; améthiste basaltine, pale

violet or reddish; chrysolithus, pale yellowish green; golden beryl, clear bright yellow, and chrysoberyllus, greenish yellow to honey or wine yellow. All the varieties are somewhat brittle and contain in 100 parts: Silica, 66.8; alumina, 19.1; glucina, 14.1.
Bery'lonite was first found loose among the disintegrated material of a granite vein at Stoneham, Maine, in 1886, and this is still the only locality '.nown. It occurs in short prismatic to tabular and highly

complex crystals having a hardness of 6 and a specific gravity of 2.84. The transparency and brilliancy of the stone resembles that of topaz. One hundred parts contain: Phosphoric acid, 55.86; glucina, 19.84; soda, 23.72. BROOKITE.
Brookite does not readily admit of polish, and in consequence has little use as a gem. Its hardness is 5.5 to 6; specific gravity, 4.12 for brookite and 4.08 for arkansite. Brookite includes the hair brown, yellowish, reddish, or ruby red, transparent to translucent kinds having a metallic adamantine luster. Arkansite includes the brilliant, ironblack, opaque kinds.
Composition: Titanium, 60.98; oxygen, 39.02.
Carbonate of lime is most widely distributed in a variety of forms, the varieties depending upon differences in origin, crystallization and structural condition, presence of impurities, ete. With the exception of pearl and coral, the many forms find a use more for decorative purposes than for personal adornment.
Pearls ave concretions, consisting essentially of carbonate of lime, found in the shells of certain mollusks. They are the result of an abnormal secretory process caused by an irritation of the mantle of the mollusk, resulting from the introduction into the shell of some foreign body, such as a grain of sand.
Pearls possess a luster peculiar to themselves, which is called pearly or nacreous. This luster may exist on the exterior surface only of the concretion, or the outer surface may be dull and dead in luster while an inner surface may be clear and lustrous. Their specific gravity is 2.5 to 2.7; their hardness 2.5 to 3.5. They may be of any shape, and in some instances of considerable size. In color they range from an opaque white, through pink, yellow, salmon, fawn, purple, red, green, brown, blue, black, passing through the several shades of these colors, or of almost any color; in addition they may be iridescent. In general, their color and luster will be that of the interior shell surface adjacent to which they are formed. :
The beauty and value of pearls is dependent upon their color, texture or ‘‘ skin,” transparency or ‘‘ water,” luster, and form, the most valuable being those which are round or. pear-shaped, slightly trans-
parent, free from specks or blemishes, and possessing to the highest:
degree the characteristic luster. Pearls are liable to deteriorate with age, contact with acids, gases, and vapors, and though various methods are in use for restoring them

<<<Page: 737>>>

to their original beauty, they are by no means to be relied upon, so that care should be taken to preserve fine pearls by carefully wiping them after use with a clean, soft cloth and keeping them wrapped in a clean cloth in a closed box.
Although nearly all bivalves with nacreous shells occasionally yield pearls, practically all of the pearls of commerce are obtained from a few families only of moliusks, prominent among which are the Aviculidae, Unionidae, and Mytilidae. The pearl oyster of the Pacific and Indian oceans, which has yielded the bulk of the pearls of the world, belongs to the first of these groups. The unio, or fresh-water mussel, so abundant in the rivers and lakes of North America, belongs to the second.
Coral is essentially carbonate of lime produced by gelatinous marine animals called polyps. The coral-forming animals are very often, though wrongly, called coral insects, and the coral is not built up as bees build a comb, but grows, as do the bones of other animals, being’ produced or secreted by a peculiar layer of the skin. The small starlike pits on a branch of coral represent the places where the various members of the colony once grew.
Although coral is found abundantly in the seas of many parts of the globe, that adapted to purposes of ornament comes almost entirely from the African coast of the Mediterranean. The beds lie at a depth of 500 to 800 feet below the surface of the sea, and the coral is won by means of iron drags and nets. The coral varies in color from deep red through pink to green, brown, yellow, white, and black. The red coral, once the most valuable, is now worth far less than the rose-pink, while the white, yellow, and black corals are of very little value.
Coral is frequently imitated in horn, bone, and ivory; also by a composition made up of plaster of paris, gum, and coloring matter.
Marbles consist essentially of carbonate of lime, with more or less carbonate of magnesia. They are fine to zoarse granular in structure, and exhibit various colors, as white, yellow, red, green, blue, ete., often clouded and giving a handsome effect when polished. Statuary marble is pure white and fine grained; the best is from Paros and Carrara, Italy. Architectural marble is both white and colored. The Cipolin is white, tinged with green. The S/ena is yellow, veined or clouded with brownish red. The MMandelato is light red with white spots. The Lardiglio is gray with dark cloudings. VerdeAntique is clouded yellowish to bluish green. The Portor or Egyptian marble is black, veined with yellow. Lamachelle or fire marble is a dark brown shell marble with brilliant fire-like or chatoyant internal reflections. Madreporic marble contains corals. Ruin marble is a kind showing, when polished, figures bearing a resemblance to cities, castles, ete., in ruins. Ool7te is a concretionary massive limestone made up of minute spherical grains resembling the roe of a fish, the name coming from

<<<Page: 738>>>

@ov, egg; pisolite differs from oolite in the larger size of its particles. Stalactites are pendent masses of limestone formed in caverns by the percolation of water, holding lime in solution, which on evaporation leaves the carbonate of lime. Stalagmites are of the same material, covering the floors of the cavern. Stalactites and stalagmites vary in diaphaneity from nearly transparent to opaque, and are frequently made up of layers of different colors, giving rise when polished to agate-like bandings. Stalagmites when fine grained and pure white are sometimes called alabaster. Oriental onyx, Gibraltar stone, onyx
marble, and Mexican onyx have beautifully banded, mottled, or clouded —
structures, often showing wide ranges of color.
Calcite and aragonite consist essentially of carbonate of lime (lime 56, carbonic acid 44). They occur crystallized and massive, and vary in color from white through various shades of gray, red, green, yellow, brown, blue, and black. Calcite has a hardness of 3 and a specific gravity of 2.72 when pure. Aragonite has a hardness of 3.5 and a specific gravity of 2.93. Their use as gems is limited to fibrous kinds, called satin spar, and those specimens showing rich colors.
Cancrinite is occasionally fine enough to be used as a gem. It erystallizes in six and twelve sided hexagonal prisms, also occurring massive. Luster, weak vitreous, inclining to greasy. Transparent to subtransparent. Color, yellow of séveral shades, also white, gray, greenish, bluish, or reddish. Hardness 5.5 to 6; specific gravity 2.44.
Cancrinite is found at Miask in the Urals; also in the Turkinsk Mountains in a coarse granite with zircon, calcite, and magnetite; and in crystals and massive at Litchfield, Maine, with sodalite and zircon. This locality affords bright orange yellow and pale yellow specimens; occasionally the yellow cancrinite is found penetrating the blue sodalite, forming, when polished, a very attractive stone.
One hundred parts of cancrinite contain: Silica, 38.7; carbon dioxide, 6.3; alumina, 29.3; lime, 4; soda, 17.8; water, 3.9.
Cassiterite, or tin stone, is used to a very limited extent for ornamental purposes. Its hardness is between 6 and 7; specific gravity 6.69; luster adamantine. Color, brown or black, occasionally gray, white, or yellow. The mineral occurs in tetragonal crystals and massive; often in reniform shapes having a fibrous structure. The variety
known as wood tin occurs in reniform or botryoidal shapes made up
of concentric layers or banding’ having a fibrous structure and resembling dark wood. ‘Toad’s-eye tin is the same on a smaller scale. Cassiterite contains in 100 parts: Tin, 78.28; oxygen, 21.62.

Catlinite, or pipe stone, is a compact clay slate of an ash gray to deep red color, or red with white and gray spots. It occurs in beds in Pipestone, especially at Coteau de Prairies, and in Cottonwood, Watonwan, Nicollet counties, Minnesota; at Flandeau and Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Sac County, Iowa; Barron County, Wisconsin, and elsewhere in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri country. Catlinite is worked into ornamental pipes, paper weights, ash trays, match boxes, and other trinkets.
The term cat’s-eye is applied to a number of minerals which, when cut cabochon, exhibit a peculiar opalescence characterized by a line, or ray, of light across the stone and resembling the contracted pupil of the eye of a cat. Among the minerals which, when. fibrous or cut across the cleavage, will show the cat’s-eye ray are: Beryl; chrysoberyl, especially the cymophane; corundum; crocidolite; dumortierite; quartz filled with acicular crystals or fibrous minerals, such as actinolite, byssolite, hornblende, ete.; hypersthene; enstatite; bronzite; aragonite; gypsum; labradorite; limonite; hematite, ete. Such gems may be opaque, translucent, or transparent, and may be of any color or colors.
The hardness, translucency, and range of color of this mineral render it suitable for use as one of the minor gems. It occurs in monoclinic crystals of a varied habit; also massive, compact, and in embedded grains. Its hardness is 6.5; brittle. Cleavage indistinct. Fracture conchoidal. Luster, vitreous. Specific gravity, 3.1 to 3.2. Color, light to dark yellow, honey yellow, garnet, hyacinth, and brownish red. Pleochroism occasionally distinct, especially in brownish-red crystals.
Chondrodite, from yovdpos, a grain, in allusion to its granular structure, occurs usually in embedded grains or granular masses in limestone. It is found abundantly at the Tilly Foster mine, Brewster, New York, in deep garnet-red crystals of great beauty.
One hundred parts contain approximately: Silica, 33.06; magnesia, 55.46; iron, 3.65; fluorine, 7.60.
The gems known as alexandrite, oriental chrysolite, and eymophane, or true cat’s-eye, are varieties of chrysoberyl. The mineral crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, generally in tabular crystals, often

<<<Page: 740>>>

twinned and frequently repeated, forming pseudo-hexagonal crystals with or without reentrant angles. The cleavage of the mineral is quite distinct in one direction. Fracture uneven. Its hardness is 8.5.
Specific gravity 3.5 to 3.84. Luster, vitreous. The color ranges from.
asparagus green, grass green, emerald green, greenish white, yellowish green, golden yellow, to brown and intermediate hues; sometimes a raspberry or columbine red by transmitted light, and occasionally having a bluish opalescence internally.
Alexandrite is the emerald-green variety which by artificial light appears a columbine or raspberry red. The crystals have a specific gravity of 3.644.
Cymophané, or true cat’s-eye, is of a greenish yellow color and exhibits a fine chatoyant effect, due to minute internal striations resulting from twinning, either of the crystal itself or of minute composite crvstals of which the whole is made up.
The name chrysoberyl is from ypvsoo, golden, and BypvAXos, beryl. Cymophane, from Kdpa, wave, and gave, to appear, alludes to its peculiar opalescence. Alexandrite is named after Alexander I of Russia.
Chrysoberyl of gem value has not as yet been found in the United States. The chief source of the supply is Minas Geraes, Brazil, and Ceylon. Alexandrite occurs chiefly in the Orenburg district, the Urals, Siberia.
This mineral, when coated with or contained in quartz or chalcedony, is occasionally cut as a gem. Chrysocolla is a hydrated copper silicate having a mountain green, bluish green, passing into a sky blue, color.
The most important of the mineral coals used for ornamental purposes is jet, a compact, soft, light coal of a lustrous velvet black color, susceptible of a high polish. It is the Gagates of Dioscoridesand Pliny, a name derived from the river Gagas, in Syria, near the mouth of which it was early found. The finest specimens are now found in detached pieces in a clay near Whitby, Yorkshire, England.
Cannel coal has « dark grayish-black or brownish-black color; a fine, compact texture; a large conchoidal fracture, and receives a good polish. It burns readily, without melting, with a clear yellow flame, and has been used as a substitute for candles, whence its name. It is ocea-
sionally worked into inkstands, snuff boxes, breast pins, bracelets, -
and other similar articles.
Anthracite is harder than either jet or cannel coal; it is iron black in color; occasionally iridescent, and has a bright, often submetallic, luster, and a conchoidal fracture. Anthracite is sometimes made into

<<<Page: 741>>>

beads and other round ornaments, trinkets, and charms. Tt is also made into candlesticks, paper weights, etc.
Brown coal is more recent in its origin than the Carboniferous period of geologists. It sometimes closely resembles ordinary bituminous, or soft coal. Other varieties have a brownish-black color,with more or less of the texture of wood remaining. Often the form and fiber of the original tree is retained. This variety is then called l/gnite. Brown coal in some of its varieties is occasionally made into paper weights, charms, and trinkets.
Cobaltite, when in groups or crusts of small, brilliant crystals, is occasionally cut into ovals or other shapes and used as ring stones, mountings for scarf pins, and other ornaments. Its color is pale steel gray, tarnishing to copper or flesh red. Its hardness is about 5.
One hundred parts contain: Cobalt, 35.5; arsenic, 45.2; sulphur, 19.3.
Corundum crystallizes in the hexagonal system in six-sided prisms and pyramids, the crystals often rough and rounded. Hardness 9. Brittle. Specific gravity about 4, the range being from 3.916 to 4.16. Luster, adamantine to vitreous; sometimes pearly on the basal plane and occasionally exhibiting a bright, opalescent, six-rayed star in the direction of the vertical axis. The color range includes nearly all the prismatic hues to colorless. Pleochroic in the strongly colored yarieties. Occasionally phosphorescent, with a rich red color.
The transparent corundums rank among the most valuable of gem stones, and include two recognized varieties, the ruby and the sapphire. The red-colored corundums are called rubies. They vary in hue from a rose to a deep carmine, the same crystal occasionally exhibiting different colors, the most approved tint being a ‘* pigeon’s blood” red. The sapphire, in general, includes corundums of any color except the red. Specifically, the name is limited in its use to the blue-colored specimens, the approved tints being royal blue, velvet blue, and cornflower blue. The sapphire occasionally exhibits a different color effect by natural light from that seen by artificial light, and as a rule is less brilliant by the latter.
Corundums of other colors are named according to their hues: Oriental emerald, the green-colored kinds, varying in tint from a lively green, exceeding that of the emerald, to a sea or bluish green.
Oriental amethyst, purple or amethystine. Oriental topaz, yellow, rivaling the yellow diamond in brilliancy. Oriental hyacinth is hyacinthine in tint and is rare. Adamantine spar includes the hair-brown varieties,
The six-rayed star seen in many clouded corundums, especially when

<<<Page: 742>>>

cut cabochon with the summits cutting the vertical axis of the prism, is due to numerous minute crystals or layers within the stone which reflect the incident light so as to produce the stellar effect. These rays are invariably white, though the specimen may be of any color, and may be best seen by artificial light. This chatoyaney, when marked, gives the asteria, or star stone, also known as the star ruby or

star sapphire, as the case may be. Should the gem assume a fibrous texture, the chatoyancy affords the ‘‘ cat’s-eye ” ray.
Corundum is associated with crystalline rocks as granular limestone or dolomite, gneiss, granite, mica slate, and chlorite slate. The finest sapphires are usually obtained from the beds of rivers, either in modified hexagonal prisms or in rolled masses, accompanied by grains of magnetic iron ore, and several species of gems.

<<<Page: 743>>>

The best rubies come from the mines of Upper Burma, in an area about 30 miles square of which Mogok is the center. The rubies are found in place in crystalline limestone; occurring also in gem-bearing gravel and in the soil of the hillsides. A similar locality exists in the marble hills of Sagyin, 16 miles north of Mandalay. Ruby mines have also been worked at Jagdalak, near Kabul, Afghanistan. Individuals occur near Bilin in Bohemia and in the sands of the Expailly River in Auvergne. Blue sapphires are brought from Ceylon. Corundum occurs in the Carnatic, on the Malabar coast, in the territories of Ava, and elsewhere in the East; also near Canton, China. At St. Gotthard, it occurs of a red or blue tinge in dolomite, and near Mozzo in the Piedmont in white compact feldspar. Adamantine spar is met with in large, coarse, hexagonal pyramids on the Malabar coast and in Gellivara, Sweden.
The great corundum region of the United States extends from the Virginia line through North and South Carolina, across Georgia and into Alabama. Numerous localities are known in the crystalline rocks of the region, especially in Madison, Buncombe, Haywood, Jackson, Macon, and Clay counties, North Carolina. Quite recently rubies, rivaling those from Burma in color, have been found in the Cowee district of North Carolina. In variety of color the North Carolina corundum excels; it is gray, green, rose, ruby, emerald, sapphire to dark blue, violet, amethystine, brown, yellow of all shades, and colorless. Fine gem sapphires are found on bars in the Upper Missouri River near Helena, Montana: They are most abundant at Eldorado Bar, Frenchman’s Bar, and Yogo Gulch, where they occur as pebbles more or less rolled. Corundum has been found in place in granite and trachyte rock in Fergus County, Montana. ‘The Montana specimens rarely exceed one-fourth to one-half inch in length and range in color from light green, light blue, steel blue, bluish red, light red, and intermediate shades; frequently the colors mentioned will appear red or assume a reddish tinge by artificial light. They are usually dichroic and often blue in one direction and red in another.
Crocidolite, from «pox«is, woof, in allusion to its fibrous structure, is a fibrous, asbestus-like mineral, having a hardness of 4 and a specitic gravity of 3.26. Its color varies from gold yellow to yellowish brown, indigo to greenish blue, leek green, and dull red. Crocidolite often contains 2 siliceous base, usually a ferruginous quartz, and when cut cabochon with a high summit and the longer diameter of the oval at right angles to the direction of the fibers of which the mineral is made up. will give the ‘‘cat’s-eye” ray. The gem is also called ‘*tiger’s

<<<Page: 744>>>

eye.” Crocidolite contains in 100 parts: Silica, 51; iron oxides, 34; soda, 7; magnesia, 2; water, 3.
The best specimens occur in Griqualand and the Orange River country, South Africa. These are essentially quartz, pseudomorphous after crocidolite, and have a hardness of about 7 and a specific gravity of 3.2. (Plate 2.)
This mineral is one of the micas and usually results from the alteration of some other mineral. It is of little use asa gem. Practically, the only locality at which the mineral is so used is Stoneham, Maine,
where a green and red damourite, altered from topaz, has been cut
into trinkets. DATOLITLE:
Datolite is another of the mineralogical gems. Its hardness is 5; specific gravity, 2.98; color, white, creamy, grayish, pale green, yellowish, reddish, or amethystine. It occurs in small, glassy crystals and massive, often having a radiating structure.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 37.7; boric acid, 21.8; lime, 34.9; water, 5.6.
The diamond is the hardest of gems; is the only one that is combustible; is the most highly refractive, and surpasses all others in the property of dispersing light—that is, dividing light into colored rays, causing that peculiar flash of prismatic hues called its five. The diamond crystallizes in the isometric system, usually in octahedrons, or combinations of octahedron, cube, dodecahedron, and tetrahedron, the crystals having their faces commonly curved. The cleavage of the diamond is highly perfect and parallel to the octahedral faces. The luster, especially of artificial faces, is peculiarly brilliant and is superior to that of any other gem. The remarkable brilliancy of the diamond results in part from the total reflection of light from its internal faces when the incident ray strikes it at an angle of a little more than 24 degrees. The stone also refracts light strongly. To the refractive
and dispersive power of the diamond are due the flash of colors or fire,
characteristic of the stone, the colorless specimens exhibiting it to the greatest degree, the colored to the least, or not at all.
The range of color of the diamond is extensive, including nearly all the prismatic hues. The whites, yellows, and browns, perhaps, afford the greatest number of shades and are the most numerous. Next to these, for colored specimens, the greens, including all shades, are most plentiful; the pure grass-green and emerald-colored stones are, however, very rare, as, indeed, are all the strongly colored specimens. Red stones of strong, rich, deep tints are extremely rare; so, too, are the garnet, hyacinth, rose-red, peach-blossom, and lilac colored speci

mens. Practically all of the blue stones known have been found in India, and their occurrence is as rare as the red. Cinnamon, brown, black, milky, and opalescent stones are occasionally met with. Pure colorless diamonds without a flaw or tint of any kind are more rare than is generally supposed.
The specific gravity of the diamond is 3.52; hardness, 10; crystallization, isometric; cleavage, octahedral and perfect; refraction simple, with an index of 2.439; a high dispersive power; luster, brilliant adamantine; is combustible though infusible; positively electric by friction; a nonconductor of electricity; is phosphorescent; does not polarize light, and consists essentially of carbon.
Three forms of the diamond are recognized: First, crystallized, the one employed in jewelry; second, crystalline, or imperfectly crystallized, having a hardness greater than that of the crystals and known as bort; this term is applied also to chips, diamond waste, and stones unsuited for cutting; third, an impure kind called carbonado; this is an opaque, steel gray to black, amorphous variety, without cleavage.
Diamonds and all other gems are rated by the carat. The term carat is derived from the name of certain small leguminous seeds which, when dry, are quite constant in weight. The brilliant, glossy, scarlet
and black seed of Abrus pecatorius weighs about 2 grains, and was
early used in India for weighing gems. An English carat is equal to 3.1683-+ grains, commonly reckoned as 3.17 grains troy, hence there are 151 carats in an English troy ounce. Reckoning the value in the metric system, the weight of a standard carat will be 0.205 grams. The carat is subdivided into halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, thirty-seconds, and sixty-fourths. A quarter carat is called a grain. This is a ‘‘diamond” grain, not a troy grain, and is but 0.7925 of a true grain. In diamonds, perfectly white stones or decided tints of red, rose, green, or blue are most highly prized. Fine cinnamon, salmon, brown, black, or yellow stones are also much esteemed. When flawless and without tint of any kind, they are termed ‘‘ first water.” If they possess a steely-blue color they are called ** blue white.” It is impossible to estimate the value of a diamond by its weight. Color, brilliancy, cut, and general perfection of the stone are all to be considered. Of two stones, both flawless and weighing 10 carats, one may be worth $600 and the other $12,000. Off-colored or defective stones may sell at $40 to $75 a carat regardless of size, while the value of an ordinary good water stone increases in an increasing ratio with its weight up to about 20 carats, beyond which no rule holds good. Exceptionally perfect stones have no fixed value, the price depending upon the purity and brilliance of the stone. Some diamonds are celebrated for their size, others for the interesting legends connected with them. Among the more interesting of these celebrated diamonds are the ‘*Regent” or ‘‘ Pitt” diamond,

<<<Page: 748>>>

weighing 13644 carats, the finest large diamond in the world. It was discovered in India in 1701, and weighed 410 carats in the rough. The finest blue diamond is the ‘*‘ Hope,” an almost sapphire-blue stone weighing 444 carats, valued at £18,000. The ‘* Dresden Green” is the finest green diamond, a pear-shaped 484 carat brilliant. The ‘‘ Orloff” is a 193-carat stone in the scepter of the Emperor of Russia. The Russian treasury also contains the ‘‘Shah,” an 86-carat stone. The ‘*Koh-i-Nur” or ‘‘mountain of light,” which weighed, when first brought to England, 186"; carats, but was reduced by recutting in 1852 to 106,45 carats, is among the English crown jewels. The ‘‘ Victoria,” a Cape diamond weighing 4573 carats in the rough and 180 carats cut, is valued at £200,000, and is perhaps the largest brilliant in the world. The largest diamond in America, and the finest yellow diamond in the world, is the ‘* Tiffany” diamond, a flawless double-cut brilliant of a rich orange-yellow color. It was found in South Africa, weighs 1252 carats, and is valued at $100,000.
For a full discussion and history of the more important stones above 100 carats in weight, as well as of many others, see Streeter’s Great Diamonds of the World.
The diamond occurs in alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, or clay, associated with quartz, gold, platinum, zircon, rutile hematite, ilmenite, chrysoberyl, topaz, corundum, garnet, etc., the associated minerals being those common in granite rocks or granitic veins. It is found also in quartzose conglomerates, in peridotite veins in gneiss, and in an eruptive pegmatite.
Before the discovery of the Brazilian mines all diamonds were brought from India and Borneo. In‘India the diamond is met with at three principal localities. The first is in southern India, in the Madras Presidency, and embraces the districts of Kadapah, Bellary, Karnul, Kistna, and Godavari. This region includes the famous ‘‘ Golconda” district, the name, however, being not that of a mine, but merely the general term for the market where diamonds were bought and sold. The second locality is farther north and includes a large tract between ‘he Mahanadi and Godavari rivers; it embraces Sambalpur and Waigarh, 80 miles southeast of Nagpur as well as portions of the province of Chutia Nagpur. The third region is in Bundelkhand, in central India, the principal working being near the city of Panna. The Indian diamonds were obtained in part from alluvial deposits and in part from a quartzose conglomerate; at Panna this conglomerate appears to be largely made up of fragments of a lower sandstone which it has been suggested may represent the original matrix. The yield of the Indian mines, once so large, is at present very small.
Borneo produces only about 3,000 carats annually. The principal locality is in the basin of the Kapoeas River on the west side of the Ratoos Mountain near the town of Pontianak.

<<<Page: 749>>>

The diamond deposits of Brazil were discovered in 1728 and were at one time very productive, although the yield is at present small. Near Diamantina in Minas Geraes the diamonds are obtained in part from river washings and in part from prairie washings. The river deposits consist of rolled quartz pebbles, mixed with or united by a ferruginous clay which rests usually on talcose clays. The more common associated minerals are rutile, hematite, ilmenite, quartz, kyanite, tourmaline, gold, garnet, zircon, etc. In the prairie washings the diamonds occur in a conglomerate consisting of quartz fragments covered with a thin bed of sand or earth. This deposit affords the finest stones. Other Brazilian localities are those of Bagagem, at which place a 247} carat stone was found, and at Abaethe, Minas Geraes. In Bahia diamonds are found at Lencaes; along the river Cacholira, especially at Surua and Sinorca; they occur also on the Salobro and other branches of the Pardo River.
Derby,' in a recent paper on the occurrence of diamonds in Brazil, says that for the question of genesis the most significant of the Brazilian localities is that of Sao Joao de Chapada, near Diamantina. The diamonds occur here in thoroughly decomposed material, no fresh rock being found. He regards the various clays as representing a group of phyllites, of varied character, of principally, if not exclusively, clastic origin threaded with dikes of pegmatite, the clastic origin of the schists being indicated by the worn character of the zircons found in the clay derived from them. The diamond streaks appeared to Derby to contain distinct bands composed in part of quartz with plates of hematite, and these bands, he suggests, may be pegmatite dikes. The primary tourmaline and zircon and the secondary hematite and rutile found in the heavy residue after washing the clay are supposed to have originated in the pegmatite, the hematite, octahedrite, and rutile having formed from the original iron and titanium minerals now gone. The staurolite and kyanite, found in the heavy residue, are supposed to have come from the schists where they may have formed as a result of contact metamorphism induced by the intrusive pegmatyte. The diamonds have come from the schist along the borders of the pegmatite dikes and not from the dikes themselves; that is, he regards it possible that the diamond is a product of contact-metamorphism.
By far the greatest portion of diamonds now obtained come from South Africa, their discovery dating from 1867. The diamond workings are of two kinds, river diggings and dry diggings. The river diggings are in the gravel of the Vaal River from Potchefstroom down to its junction with the Orange River, and along the latter as far as Hopetown, the principal workings being along the Vaal between Klip

Drift and its junction with the Hart River. The dry diggings are chiefly in Griqualand-West, south of the Vaal River, on the border of the Orange Free State, about 640 miles northeast of Cape Town. There are here a number of limited areas approximately spherical or oval in form, with an average diameter of some 800 yards, the entire productive area being all within a circle having a radius of about 2 miles. These mines were originally worked as individual claims, but they are now all consolidated in one gigantic monopoly which practically controls the diamond output of the world. Some idea of the enormous output of the region may be gained from the statement that from

1867 to 1887 over 33,000,000 carats, or more than 64 tons of diamonds have been taken out, valued in the rough at $225,000,000, and after cutting at $450,000,000.
At the Kimberly mines the diamantiferous area is inclosed in a wall of nearly horizontal black carboniferous shale. The upper portion of the deposit consists of a friable mass of pale yellow color, called the ‘‘yellow ground.” Below the reach of atmospheric influences the rock is more firm and of a bluish green color; it is called the ‘‘ blue ground.” This consists essentially of a serpentinous breccia inclosing fragments
of carbonaceous shale, bronzite, diallage, garnet, magnetite, etc. The

<<<Page: 751>>>

diamonds are rather abundantly distributed through the mass, often to the amount of four to six to the cubic yard. These areas are believed to be volcanic pipes, and the occurrence of the diamonds is obviously connected with the igneous intrusive, either being formed by the action of heat upon the carbonaceous shales, or being brought up from underlying rocks.
In this connection De Launay' treats of the occurrence and origin of the Cape diamonds as follows: He describes the serpentine of the Kimberly mines as being derived from a peridotite determined as a picrite-porphyry. Mixed with the serpentine are abundant fragments of various rocks, so that many specimens are of the nature of a contactbreccia. The serpentine bodies occur as pipes extending downward in a nearly vertical direction to an unknown depth. In following the volcanic pipes down it has been proved that each one passes through several formations. At the surface the inclosing rocks are carbonaceous shales, and at one time it was believed that the crystallized carbon was primarily derived from these shales. Underlying these shales is a bed of diabase. The serpentine at this horizon still contained diamonds. Below the diabase horizon are quartzites, through which the miners are now engaged in working. According to De Launay, the inclosing terranes have had no influence on either the quantity or quality of the diamonds. He therefore holds that the diamonds have come from below with the peridotite-breccia and that the diamonds did not originate in the Upper Carbonaceous shales. He believes that since the cavities which contain the serpentine pipes are in the nature of volcanic chimneys, water, penetrating to the contact of a molten metallic bath charged with various carburets, caused the sudden formation of carburets of hydrogen, and by their explosion the opening of the volcanic chimneys. The water produced the scorification of the molten peridotite magma, and by the compression thus exercised on the carbon, the crystallization of the diamonds. Finally water accompanied the eruption of the peridotite and caused its serpentinization.
Diamonds are mined in the Urals, where they were discovered in 1829. They occur in the gold washings of the detritus along the Adolfskoi Creek, near Bisersk, and elsewhere along the western declivity of the Uralian range. In Australia they are found in the alluvial of the Cudgegong River, near Mudgee, and in the valley of the Horton River, in the Bingera district of New South Wales.
A few crystals have been occasionally met with in the United States in Rutherfor?, Franklin, Mitchell, and McDowell counties, North Carolina; in Hall County, Georgia; in Kentucky, Ohio, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Idaho, and in the placers of Eldorado, Amador, Nevada,

Butte, Trinity, and Del Norte counties, California. In 1856 the Dewey diamond, weighing when cut 11} carats, was found at Manchester, near Richmond, Virginia.
The smallness of the crystals, together with their brittleness, makes this mineral of little use as a gem. Its hardness is 6.5 to 7. Specitie gravity, 3.3 to 3.5. Luster, brilliant; pearly on cleavage face. Color, grayish white, greenish gray, hair brown, topaz to fawn yellow, and colorless; occasionally violet blue in one direction, plum blue inanother, and pale asparagus green in a third. Diaspore occurs foliated and massive and in orthorhombic prismatic crystals; usually small, thin, and flattened. The mineral is commonly found with corundum or emery in dolomite, chlorite schist, and other crystalline rocks. Perhaps the finest diaspores are those found near Unionville, Chester County, Pennsylvania. At this locality crystals have been found measuring from $ to 1} inches in length and ¢ inch in thickness.
One hundred parts contain: Alumina, 85.1; water, 14.9.
Diopside is occasionally cut asa gem. It is a variety of pyroxene occurring in monoclinic crystals of a prismatic habit. Its hardness is about 6. Specific gravity, 3.2 to 3.38. Luster; vitreous.

Luster, vitreous. Color, rich emerald green. Transparent to subtransiu.7ent. Double refraction, strong. Cleavage, rhombohedral and perfect. Pyroelectric.
Dioptase is limited in its use as a gem by its softness and brittleness. It occurs in druses and crystalline aggregates on quartz in seams of a
“compact limestone near Altyn-Tube, in the Kirghese Steppes, whence

<<<Page: 753>>>

it was first brought by a Bucharian merchant, Achir Mahmed, after whom it was called Achir7te. Fine crystals are found at Mindouli, near Comba, the French Congo, whence the name Congo emerald. Brilliant crystals are found at the copper mines near Clifton, Graham County, Arizona.
One hundred parts contain: Copper oxide, 50.4; silica, 38.2; water, 11.4.
Dumortierite occurs commonly in fibrous to columnar aggregates and massive; rarely in distinct orthorhombic crystals. Luster, vitreous. Hardness, 7. Specific gravity, 3.26. Color, strong smalt blue to greenish blue; strongly pleochroic, being colorless, reddish violet, and deep ultramarine in the several directions. The fibrous kinds, when cut cabochon with sufficiently high summits, will often afford the *Scat’s-eye” ray. In composition the mineral is essentially a basic aluminum silicate, containing in 100 parts: Silica, 30.6; alumina, 69.4.
Enstatite, bronzite, and hypersthene are orthorhombic pyroxenes occurring commonly crystalline, massive, fibrous, lamellar, or foliated. Their hardness does not exceed 6; their specific gravity, 3.5, and their colors include the various shades of green, gray, brown, white, and black. When cut cabochon across the fibers they will all afford the ** cat’s-eye” ray.
Fnstatite is yellowish, grayish, or greenish white; has a vitreous to pearly luster; a specific gravity of 3.10 to 3.13; a hardness of 5.5, and is somewhat brittle. In composition it is essentially a magnesian silieate containing in 100 parts: Silica, 60; magnesia, 40.
Bronzite is grayish to olive green and brown in color; has an adamantine pearly to a metalloidal or bronze-like luster; a specific gravity of 3.1 to 3.3, and a hardness of 5.5. In composition it is an enstatite, having its magnesium in part replaced by iron. Bronzite and enstatite are common constituents of peridotites and the serpentines derived from them; occurring also in the crystalline schists.
Hypersthene is dark brownish green, grayish black, greenish black, and pinchbeck brown, occasionally marked by a play of color resulting from included labradorite. Luster, pearly on cleavage face and frequently exhibiting a peculiar metalloidal effect; hardness, 6; specific gravity, 3.4 to 3.5.
Hypersthene, associated with labradorite, is common in certain granular eruptive rocks, as noryte and gabbro. In composition it is analogous to an enstatite in which the magnesium has in part been replaced by iron, often in the proportion of 1:1.

Epidote occurs in monoclinic crystals, commonly prismatic and in fibrous to granular masses having a hardness of 6 to 7, a specific gravity of 3.2 to 5, and a vitreous luster, inclining to pearly or resinous on certain faces. Ordinarily the color is a peculiar yellowish green, seldom seen in other minerals; from this it may pass into light and dark shades, black on one side and brown on the other; red, yellow, gray, and colorless varieties also occur. Epidote is doubly refracting and strongly pleochroic, showing a green, a brown, and a yellow as viewed in the several directions.
Thulite is a closely related mineral occurring in orthorhombic forms and in columnar to compact masses, having a specific gravity of 3.124 and a hardness of about 6.5. Its color varies from a peach-blossom red to rose red; strongly pleochroic, showing a light rose, a deep rose, and a yellow color in the different directions.
Epidote is common in many crystalline rocks, as syenite, gneiss, schist, and serpentine. It is sometimes found in geodes in trap, and also in sandstone adjoining trap dikes, as a result of contact metamorphism. It occasionally forms with quartz an epidote rock, and is sometimes found in nodules in the different quartz rocks or altered sandstones.
One hundred parts contain, approximately: Silica, 38; alumina, 22; ferric oxide, 15; lime, 23; water, 2.
Euclase, named by Hauy from ¢€v, easily, and xkAd@@, to break, though susceptible of a high polish, is rarely used as a gem stone because of its brittleness. It varies in color from pale mountain green to indigo blue and white. Its hardness is 7.5, and its specific gravity about 3.1. The mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic system and exhibits trichroism.
One hundred parts contain, approximately: Silica, 41.2; alumina, 35.2; glucina, 17.4; water, 6.2.
Euclase occurs in the mining district of Villa Rica, Minas Geraes, Brazil, associated with topaz in a chloritie schist. It is found also in the auriferous sands of the Orenburg district of the southern Urals, associated with topaz, corundum, kyanite, rutile, ete.
Fluorite crystallizes in the isometric system, commonly in cubes; occurring also massive and granular, coarse or fine. The mineral has a perfect octahedral cleavage; a conchoidal to splintery fracture; is

<<<Page: 755>>>

brittle; has a hardness of 4+, a specific gravity of 3.18, anda highly vitreous luster. The color range is extensive, including white, yellow, green, violet, sky and amethystine blue, brown, wine yellow, rose red, crimson, and pink. It sometimes presents a bluish fluorescence, and is phosphorescent when heated gently. This is especially characteristic of the variety chlorophane, or cobra stone, which emits a bright emerald-green light on a comparatively low rise of temperature.
Fluorite, though too soft for continuous wear, is occasionally cut as a gem, chiefly for collectors’ use, and a massive variety occurring in the north of England is not infrequently worked up into trinkets, paper weights, vases, and other ornaments.
Fluorite occurs in veins and beds in gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, limestone, and sandstone.
One hundred parts contain: Calcium, 51.3; fluorine, 48.7.
Gadolinite, a complex silicate of yttrium and other earths, occurs usually massive, rarely in monoclinic crystals. Its hardness is 6.5; specific gravity, 4.35; color, black, of several shades. The mineral affords velvety black, opaque gems and is ‘cut for collectors’ use only.
The garnet includes several varieties, which are distinguishable by their differences in composition and in part by their colors. The mineral crystallizes in the isometric system, commonly in dodecahedrons and trisoctahedrons and derived forms. It is singly refracting and monochroic; has a vitreous to resinous luster, and varies in hardness and specific gravity, according to the variety, from 6.5 to 7.5 and 3.15 to 4.3, respectively.
In composition garnet is a silicate of different bases—alumina, lime, magnesia, chrome, iron, manganese, and titanium. There are three prominent groups, with several subdivisions under each, many of these passing into each other. They are:
I. Aluminum garnet: Grossularite—Lime-aluminum garnet. Pyrope—Magnesium-aluminum garnet. Almandite—Iron-aluminum garnet. Spessartite—Manganese-aluminum garnet.
II. Iron garnet: Andradite—Lime-iron garnet. Ili. Chromium garnet: Ouvarovite—Lime-chrome garnet.
The lime-aluminum garnet has a hardness of 7, a specific gravity of 3.55 to 3.66, and its color range includes white, pale green, amber, honey, wine, and brownish yellow, cinnamon brown, and pale rose red. The several varieties are: Lssonite, cinnamon stone, or hyacinth. The

<<<Page: 756>>>

kind of this variety more commonly used as a gem includes the clear cinnamon brown to a deep gold tinged with brown specimens. Its hardness is 7 and its specific gravity 3.6. Grossularite, the pale green, yellow to nearly white, pale pink, reddish orange, and brown kinds. Romanzovite is brown. Wilucte is yellowish green to greenish white in color. TZopazolite is topaz to citrine yellow. Succinite is an amber-colored kind.
The principal magnesian garnet is the pyrope, meaning “‘fire-like,” a deep blood red to nearly black stone, prized asa gem. It is among the hardest of the garnets, ranking 7.5 in the scale. Its specific gravity lies between 3.7 and 3.8. (Fig. 7.)
The almandite, or carbunele, and rhodolite are iron-aluminum garnets. Almandite varies in color from cherry red, blood red to deep
Fig. 7.
GARNET CRYSTAL AND PEBBLES OF PYROPE. Specimen No. 82575, U.S.N.M.
red of several tints, occasionally assuming an orange hue by artificial light. The color of the rhodolite lies between a violet purple and a brownish red. These varieties have a hardness of about 7.5, with a specific gravity seldom less than 4, and occasionally as high as 4.3. Both are prized as gems. Spessartite is a manganese aluminum garnet, varying in specific gravity from 8.7 to 4.3, and has a hardness of about 7. The color varies from a reddish brown, dark hyacinth red, sometimes with | a tinge of violet, to orange red. It often affords fine gems. The « ‘alcium-iron garnet varies in specific gravity between 3.6 and 4 and in hardness from 5 to 7. The group includes a number of varieties, varying widely in color and other respects, the more important

<<<Page: 757>>>

of which are: Andradite, a yellow or orange-brown variety. Demantoid or Uralian emerald, a grass-green, emerald-green, or brownishgreen stone having a brilliant luster, and when cut exhibiting considerable fire, especially by artificial light. It is somewhat soft, having a hardness of about 5. Colophonite is a brownish-black garnet, characterized by a resinous luster. J/elanite is a black to yellow-brown kind.
The lime-chrome garnet, owvarovite, is almost invariably a fine emerald green, and is harder than any of the other varieties, ranking nearly 8 in the scale.
In the trade the lighter-colored clear garnets are often called hyacinth. The yellowish is the jacinta, a yellowish-red, the guarnaccino or vermeille, the red with a tinge of violet, rubino-di-rocca or grenat syriam. The deep clear red is the true precious garnet and is often called carbuncle.
Garnet is common in mica schist, hornblende and chlorite schist, gneiss, syenitic gneiss, and granite, occurring also in limestone, serpentine, and volcanic rocks. The garnet of granite, gneiss, mica schist, and similar rocks is commonly almandite. Grossula ite is common in limestones and crystalline schists. Pyrope belongs especially to peridotites and the serpentines derived from them; occurs also in basalts. Spessartite occurs in granitic rocks, in quartzite, in certain schists, and in some rhyolytes. Iron garnets are common in eruptive rocks, occurring also as a product of contact metamorphism. Demantoid occurs in serpentine. The chrome garnets belong particularly with the chromite in serpentine; found also in granular limestone.
A hydrated oxide of iron, which, when occurring in acicular crystals in limpid quartz, is often cut into gems. The color of the géthite is yellowish, reddish, and blackish brown.
Gold, in crystals, filiform, reticulated, and arborescent shapes, or in nuggets, is frequently worn as a jewel. Gold penetrating white, black, rose, and amethystine quartz is worked into jewelry of all sorts, the designs often being elaborate.
Gypsum occurs in monoclinic crystals and massive. It has a hardness of 2, a specific gravity of 2.3, and is usually white in color, sometimes gray, flesh red, honey, and ocher yellow, blue, brown, and black. Three varieties are recognized. 1. Selenite, occurring either in distinct crystals or broad folia, which are transparent throughout. It is

<<<Page: 758>>>

not used as a gem. 2. Satin spar, a fine fibrous variety having the pearly opalescence of moonstone and affording the ‘‘cat’s-eye ” ray when cut cabochon. Though soft, it is frequently worked up into beads, pins, and other ornaments. 3. Alabaster, a fine-grained, white or delicately clouded variety. It is worked up into carvings, statuettes, and other ornamental objects.
Gypsum often forms extensive beds in connection with various stratified rocks, especially limestones and marlytes; found also in erystalline rocks, about the fumaroles of volcanoes, and is deposited on the evaporation of sea water and brines, in which it exists in solution.
One hundred parts contain: Sulphuric acid, 46.51; lime, 32.56; water, 20.93.
The compact, fibrous kinds of hematite are cut into beads, intaglios, charms, and other ornaments. The color is iron black to steel gray; luster metallic and opalescent; hardness 6; specific gravity 4.5 to 5.3. One hundred parts contain: Iron, 70; oxygen, 30.
Chromic iron and ilmenite have a use similar to that of hentai The hardness, specific gravity, and color of both are also near that of hematite. Chromic iron contains: Iron, 38; chrome, 62. Ilmenite consists essentially of the oxides of iron and titanium in varying proportions.
The use of hornblende as a gem is limited to those specimens found penetrating liquid quartz. As such, especially when the hornblende is in delicate acicular crystals, interlaced and penetrating the quartz in every direction, it affords very beautiful gems.
Iolite, called also dichroite and saphir d’eau, or water sapphire, is occasionally used as a gem. It occurs in orthorhombic crystals of a prismatic habit, and massive, compact. The hardness is greater than that of quartz; its specific gravity is 2.60 to 2.66, and its luster vitreous. The colors are the various shades of blue, commonly a smoky blue, either light or dark. Its pleochroism is strongly marked, the crystals presenting different shades of blue, bluish white, and yellowish gray, according to the direction in which they are viewed; hence the name dichroite, meaning two colored.
Iolite occurs in granite, gneiss, chloritic and talcose schists, and allied rocks; also in igneous rocks, and as a contact mineral in connec-. tion with eruptive dikes, as in slates adjoining granite. The saphir d’eau occurs in small rolled masses of a strong blue color in the alluvial deposits of Ceylon. The mineral alters readily on exposure, so that it

<<<Page: 759>>>

is most commoniy found in an altered condition or inclosed in altered iolite. One hundred parts contain: Silica, 49.6; alumina, 33.8; magnesia, 8.7; oxide of iron, 7.9. ILVAITE.
Ilvaite has little value as a gem, but is occasionally used for the letter I in sentimental jewelry. It is iron black in color; has a hardness of 6; a specific gravity of 3.99>and a submetallic luster. The mineral crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, commonly in prisms, also occurring columnar or compact massive.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 29.3; oxides of iron, 54.8; lime, 13.7; water, 2.2.
Occurs in compact masses with cleavage. Its color is grayish or velvet black to dark green, occasionally spotted red like heliotrope and then used as a gem. Its hardness is 6 to 6.5; specific gravity, 2.912; luster, vitreous, and is translucent to opaque. Isopyre occurs in a quartzose granite near Penzance, Cornwall, England, and in a breccia near Edinburgh, Scotland.
The mineral contains in 100 parts: Silica, 47.09; alumina, 13.91; iron, 20.07; lime, 15.43; copper, 1.94.
Jade, as commonly used, is a generic term including various mineral substances, as chloro-melanite or jadeite, nephrite, saussurite, pseudonephrite, of tough, compact texture, and ranging in color from cream white to dark green and nearly black. The Asiatic jade is usually pale green or bluish white, while that of New Zealand is dark green.
The term jade includes properly two minerals only—nep/rite and jadeite. The one isa tough, compact, fine-grained tremolite, a variety of amphibole, having a hardness of 6 to 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.96 to 3.1. The other is a tough, fibrous foliated to closely compact mineral grouped with the pyroxenes. Its hardness is 6.5 to 7 and its specific gravity 3.33 to 3.35.
The lack of brilliancy in jade makes it of little value as an article of jewelry, but its great toughness renders it eminently suitable for ornamental vases and other carved work displaying delicacy of workmanship.
Kyanite, when transparent and of a good color, is employed as a gem. The name is from Kvavos, blue, though the mineral affords examples of other colors, such as white, gray, green, and black. Disthene is

from 61s, twice, and @4evos, strong, alluding to its unequal hardness and electrical properties in two different directions.
The mineral occurs commonly in long-bladed triclinic crystals and | in bladed to subfibrous masses. Hardness, 5 to 7, depending upon the direction and crystal face upon which the test is made. Specific gravity, 3.56 to 3.67. Luster, vitreous. The color is commonly pale blue, often a deeper hue along the center of the blades, also white, gray, green, and black; pleochroism strong in colored kinds.
Kyanite occurs principally in gneiss and muscovite and paragonite schist.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 37; alumina, 63.
Labradorite is one of the feldspars occurring in triclinic crystals and cleavable to granular masses. Its hardness is 6; specific gravity, 2.72; luster, vitreous, passing into pearly, translucent to subtranslucent; color, gray, brown, or greenish, sometimes colorless and glassy. Owing chiefly to a peculiarity in its intimate structure, labradorite, especially of the cleavable kinds, often shows a magnificent play of | colors, in which blue and green predominate, while yellow, red, pearl gray, orange, puce, amber, and peach blossom hues are apparent, together with a golden and copper schiller. The mineral takes a high polish, and, because of its chatoyant reflections, is often very beautiful.
Labradorite is an essential constituent of various rocks, especially the basic kinds, and is usually associated with some member of the pyroxene or amphibole groups. Labradoritic massive rocks are most common among the Archaean formations. It was brought first from the coast of Labrador, hence the name.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 53.1; alumina, 30.1; lime, 12.3; soda, 4.5.
Lapis-lazuli, long thought to be a simple mineral, consists of a mixture of a bluish substance (lazurite) with granular calcite, scapolite, diopside, amphibole mica, pyrite, etc. The richly colored kinds are highly esteemed for costly vases, mosaics, and other ornamental work. Color, rich Berlin or azure blue, violet blue, and greenish blue; occa— sionally containing a colorless substance and frequently including brass yellow specks of pyrite; these are often so numerous as to produce a spangled appearance. Its hardness is 5.5; specific gravity about 2.4; luster, vitreous; translucent.
Lapis-lazuli occurs commonly massive in limestone and in a granitic rock.
In composition 1t carries in 100 parts: Silica, 31.7; alumina, 26.9; soda, 27.3; sulphur 16.

Obsidian is compact volcanic glass. Its specific gravity is 2.25 to 2.8. The hardness is somewhat less than that of ordinary feldspar. The prevalent: color of the material is black, but some of it is mottled and streaked with brownish red or various shades of brown; sometimes in reddish-brown spherules in a gray matrix; also green of several shades to light and dark yellow. Certain fibrous specimens will afford the cat’s-eye ray.
The kinds used as gems are known as: Moldavite or bottle stone, a green-colored obsidian; marekanite or mountain mahogany, a red colored or banded black and brown variety, and /celand agate, pearlylite, and sphaerulite.
_ Olivine crystallizes in the orthorhombic system; also occurring massive; compact or granular; commonly in embedded grains. Its hardness is 6.5 to 7. Specific gravity, 3.33 to 3.44. Cleavage distinct. Fracture, conchoidal. Brittle. Luster, vitreous. Color, commonly olive green, sometimes brownish, grayish red, and occasionally black. Double refraction, strong. Dichroism occasionally marked, the peridot giving a straw-yellow and a green image.
The kinds used as gems are known as: Chrysolite, yellowish green; peridot or evening emerald, having an olive pistachio, or leek-green color, of a quieter hue than that of the emerald, the approved tint being similar to that seen on looking through a delicate green leaf, and hyalosiderite, called also Job’s tears, a highly ferruginous variety having a specific gravity as high as 3.57 and a rich olive-green color. .
Olivine is a common constituent of some eruptive rocks; not uncommon in granular limestone and dolomite; occurring also in certain schists and in ore deposits.

<<<Page: 765>>>

The percentage composition of olivine, though the iron oxide may be more or less replaced by magnesia, is, approximately: Silica, 41; magnesia, 50; iron oxide, 9.
Octabedrite crystallizes in the tetragonal system, commonly on octahedra. Its hardness is nearly 6, its specific gravity 4.86, and its color includes the several shades of brown, passing into deep blue or black; sometimes greenish yellow to pale green. Fine blue crystals of this mineral from Brazil are so remarkably brilliant as to be 1aistaken for diamonds.

<<<Page: 766>>>

often inclining to resinous, and occasionally to pearly. Color, white, yellow, red, brown, green, gray (the dark color arising from foreign admixtures); sometimes having a brilliant play of colors by reflected and refracted light. This play of colors is not due to the presence of colored substances as constituents of the mineral, but to a physical condition of the specimen resulting from a multitude of fissures, the sides of which are minutely striated, and which cause a diffraction and decomposition of the light which falls upon them. The size of these striations and fissures influence the color and its distribution within the mineral; occasionally the patches of color are of a uniform size; again, they may be irregular. Certain specimens may show a predominance of one set of colors, as red and orange; others may show chiefly green and blue tints.
There are many varieties of the opal to which specific names have been given. The precious opal exhibits a play of delicate colors, reflecting now one hue and then another. The harlequin opal presents a variegated play of colors on a reddish ground and resembles the fire opal. The jive opal presents hyacinth red to honey yellow colors, with fire-like reflections, somewhat irised on turning. Girasol is a bluish white translucent kind, presenting reddish reflections in a strong light. Lechosos opal is a name applied to those kinds showing deep green flashes of color. /Hydrophane is a whitish or light colored opaque kind which becomes transparent when immersed in water. Cacholong is an opaque porcelain, bluish, yellowish, or reddish white variety. Opal agateisagate-like in structure. Jasp opal contains several per cent of iron, and is the analogue in opal of jasper in quartz. Wood opal is wood silicified by opal; sometimes called /ithoxyle when showing a woody structure. (Plate 4.) Hyalite, or Miller's glass, is either colorless and pellucid like glass, or a translucent bluish white. Moss opal contains moss-like inclusions of manganese oxide and is the analogue in opal of the moss agate in quartz. Tabasheer is an amorphous opal-like silica deposited within the joints of bamboo; it absorbs water and becomes transparent like hydrophane.
The opal occurs filling seams, cavities, and fissures in igneous rocks, etc. It occurs also embedded in limestone and argillaceous beds. It consists essentially of silica in the soluble or gelatinizing condition, but often combined with insoluble silica, and is more or less hydrous.
Orthoclase, common feldspar, occurs in monoclinic crystals, often prismatic in habit, and massive, coarsely cleavage to compact,.and flint-like or jasper-like. Cleavage perfect in one direction, less so ia another. Hardness, 6. Specific gravity, 2.4 to 2.6. Luster, vitreous, sometimes inclining to pearly on the face of a perfect cleavage, and

occasionally having a satin-like effect or schiller. Color, white; often gray, reddish white, flesh red, greenish white, and occasionally green. Transparent to translucent.
The difference in color, luster, and other physical properties has given rise to distinct names for several varieties of this mineral, the more important of which for use as gems are: Adularia, a transparent or translucent variety differing from ordinary orthoclase in presenting, when polished, chatoyant or pearly reflections. The kinds exhibiting this chatoyancy to the greatest degree are known as moonstones, and have, as a rule, a specific gravity of 2.58. Aventurine is less pellucid and has reddish and yellow internal reflections arising from minute scales of occluded minerals.” Sunstone is a similar variety. Cassinite is a bluish-green kind, having a pearly luster and more or less of an aventurine character. Zee/ite has a deep flesh-red color, with a waxy luster. /%rthite is a flesh-red feldspar, consisting of interlaminated orthoclase and albite, and which often affords bright aventurine reflections. Vardol/te is a dark-green variety containing lighter globular particles; it was so called in allusion to its supposed power in preventing and curing smallpox.
Orthoclase in its several varieties belongs especially to the crystalline rocks, occurring as an essential constituent in granite, gneiss, syenite, porphyry, etc.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 64.8; alumina, 18.4.
Pegmatite consists of feldspar and quartz, in which the quartz, arranged in parallel positions, is so distributed through the feldspar as to appear like oriental characters.
Phenacite crystallizes in the hexagonal system; has a hardness of 8; a specific gravity of 2.96; it is colorless, often clouded or milky; also straw and wine yellow and cinnamon colored. The clouded kinds are dichroic. The colorless transparent kinds exhibit considerable ** fire,” especially by artificial light, and may easily be mistaken for the diamond, hence the name, from ®évas, a deceiver.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 54.3; glucina, 45.7.
The term porphyry, as here used, applies to that class of rocks in which the mass of the rock, or groundmass, is so compact and dense as to appear practically nonerystalline, and in which are embedded large, scattering, more or less perfectly formed crystals, usually of quartz or feldspar. These crystals being of a different color from the
NAT Mus 1900

<<<Page: 770>>>

groundmass stand out in marked contrast. The porphyries are, as a rule, hard, tough, and without rift or grain. They may be of several shades of color, as green with splashes of white, or a paler green or red with white specks, ete. Near Charlotte, North Carolina, there occurs a cream-colored quartz porphyry which is penetrated by long parallel streaks of a dead-black color. The stone, when cut across the streaks, has a spotted appearance (hence the name Leopardite); cut parallel with the streaks it gives a dentritic or moss-like effect.
Porphyry finds a use more as an ornamental stone than as a stone for personal adornment.
Prehnite occurs more commonly massive, usually in reniform, botryoidal, globular, and stalactitic shapes. Hardness, 6.5; specific gravity, 2.8 to 2.95; luster, vitreous, occasionally pearly on certain surfaces. Color, light green of several shades, passing into white and gray, the color often fading on exposure. When cut and polished the darker kinds resemble chrysoprase in color and luster.
Chlorastrolite, from chloros (green), aster (star), and lithos (stone), is an impure variety of prehnite, occurring in small rounded pebbles obtained from the trap on the shores of Isle Royale, Lake Superior. It is opaque, of a mottled green color, somewhat chatoyant on the rounded sides, and receives a high polish.
Zonochlorite occurs on a small island off Neepigon Bay, Lake Superior. Its green color and banded appearance has given’ it its name from zona, a band; chloros, green; and lithos, stone.
Prehnite occurs as a secondary mineral in veins and cavities in the more basic eruptive rocks as basalt and diabase; less often in the crystalline rocks, granite, gneiss, and syenite.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 48.8; alumina, 24.8; lime, 27.1;
ater, 4.3. PYRITE AND MARCASITE.
Pyrite and marcasite are occasionally cut into squares, ovals, and other shapes for use as settings for rings, scarf pins, trinkets, etc. The two minerals contain the same elements in the same proportions—iron 46.7 and sulphur 53.3 parts per 100—but differ in their physical properties. Pyrite has a hardness of 6.5; specific gravity, 5.2; crystalline form, isometric; color, brass yellow, and is the kind more commonly used for ornaments. Marcasite has a hardness of 6; specific gravity, 4.8; crystalline form, orthorhombic; color, pale or grayish yellow. During the eighteenth century both pyrite and marcasite were cut into facetted forms and extensively used for jewelry.

Quartz crystallizes in the hexagonal system, the most common form being a six-sided prism, generally striated horizontally. The crystals are often highly modified; some appear to haye each alternate plane of the prism suppressed; some have the prism with pyramids at each end; others have the two pyramids only; still others have the edges and angles replaced by new planes. It occurs also in stalactitic, mam-

millary, and other imitative shapes, and massive, either impalpable, fine, or coarse granular. Hardness, 7; specific gravity, 2.5 to 2.8, depending upon the amount of impurity present, the purest kinds 2.65. Luster, vitreous, sometimes inclining to resinous, and varying in degree from splendent to dull. Colorless when pure; often various shades of yellow, red, brown, green, blue, and black. Quartz is doubly refractive and the colored kinds are dichroic. (Plate 5.)

<<<Page: 772>>>

Quartz includes a larger number of kinds of gems among its varieties than any other mineral. The varieties arise from differences in color, mode of formation, or crystallization. These varieties, though differing widely in appearance and passing under a variety of names, are chemically all of one substance. The following is a list of the kinds commonly recognized:
Agate.—A variegated chalcedonic quartz, the colors in clouds, spots, bends, or layers. The bands or layers may be either parailel or concen-

tric, and either in straight, circular, or zigzag forms. Banded agates may be called fortification, banded, or eye agates, according to the arrangement of the layers. (See fig. 8.)
Agatized wood.—N ood silicified by silica and usually having the structure of the original material. The western part of the United States affords some remarkable specimens of this material. In Apache County, Arizona, there is a silicified forest in which trunks 150 feet

Bloodstone or heliotrope.—A translucent to opaque jasper of a deepgreen color interspersed with red spots.
Cairngorm, smoky quartz, or morion.—Having a smoky gray, yellow, yellowish-brown, and brown color. The crystals are often pellucid, but occasionally the color is so deep as to render them nearly opaque.
Carnelian.—A reddish variety of chalcedony passing into grayish red, yellow, and brown; translucent, like horn. The carnelian takes a fine polish and is often of a clear bright tint. The colors are commonly heightened by exposure to the sun or by heat. (Plate 6.)
Cat’s-eye.—Translucent quartz exhibiting opalescence or chatoyancy when cut cabochon, an effect due to inclusions of fibrous minerals, such as hornblende, asbestus, actinolite, and crocidolite. The color is commonly light greenish gray; sometimes yellow, red, or brownish.
Chalcedony.—Translucent, subtranslucent, or opaque, usually having a waxy luster and a white, yellow, brown, or bluish color. It occurs massive in imitative shapes.
Chrysoprase.—An apple, leek-green, bluish, or yellowish translucent chalcedony.
Citrine quartz, false, Saxon, Scotch, or Spanish topaz.—A lightyellow, brown, or greenish-yellow, pellucid quartz.
Ferruginous quartz, rubasse, Ancona ruby, or Mont Blane ruby, is opaque-red, brownish-red, or ocher-yellow crystallized quartz.
Flint.—A more or less opaque chalcedonic quartz, usually gray, smoke brown, and brownish black.~ Breaks with a conchoidal fracture and a sharp cutting edge.
LTornstone closely resembles flint, but has a more splintery fracture.
Llyaline is an opalescent white quartz.
Jasper.—An impure massive quartz or chaleedonic rock, presenting little beauty until polished. Color, dull red, yellow, brown, or green, sometimes blue or black. When the colors are banded it is called 77bband jasper. If zoned with colors, yellow, red, brown, or black, it is called Lyyptian jasper. Jasper takes a high polish, and is extensively used in the manufacture of mosaics, vases, snuff and match boxes, knife handles, ete.
Milky quartz is a massive, vitreous variety, having a milk-white color. It is occasionally opalescent, and sometimes has a greasy luster.
Moss agate or mocha stone is a chalcedony, containing dendritic or moss-like markings.
Onyx.—Like agate, but the colors are arranged in horizontal planes or layers, so that it can be used in cutting cameos. When the layers consist of reddish and white chalcedony the stone is called sardonyz.
Plasma.—A more or less translucent chalcedony, having a leaf-green color.
Prase.—A leek or olive green, somewhat spotted, massive quartz.
Lock crystal.—Transparent and colorless; includes the pure crystals of quartz.

presence in working up the specimen. Gold, silver, copper, etc., are frequent inclusions, and such specimens are largely used in jewelry. Often the included mineral is so abundant that the quartz is present only as a cementing material. An example of this is seen in the crocidolite quartz ox tiger-eye.
Sapphirine or siderite.—A translucent, indigo, Berlin, or pale grayish blue, vitreous quartz.

<<<Page: 780>>>

Sard.—A translucent, red, brownish red, blood red, golden or amber colored chalcedony. Quartz crystals are occasionally met with which are irridescent within, an effect due to fractures and cavities in the interior.. Such crystals are cut and sold under the name of 777s. The irised effect is frequently produced by artificial means, usually by heating and then suddenly cooling the specimen.
Quartz is widespread in its occurrence, being found in some of its varieties in nearly every rock stratum. The varieties consist essen-tially of either amorphous or crystalline silica in various forms, associated with various coloring compounds, such as those containing iron, manganese, or nickel.
thodonite has a hardness of 6.5, a specific gravity of 3.6, and a vitreous luster. The kinds used as ornamental stones are a fine rose to flesh red, often streaked with black. Though somewhat soft, the mineral is nearly as tough as jade. The variety known as fowlerite occurs in fine flesh-red crystals, some of them over + inches thick, at Franklin, Sussex County, New Jersey.
Rhodonite contains: Silica, 45.9; manganese oxide, 54.1.
Rutile occurs crystallized and massive. The crystals are frequently acicular; often geniculated, and usually have their vertical planes striated. Hardness, 6 to 6.5; specific gravity, 4.25; luster, metallic adamantine; color, reddish brown passing into red, black, yellowish, violet, blue, and occasionally green. The black variety, nigrine, more closely approaches the black diamond in appearance than any other gem. The reds have the tone and color of the garnet; acicular crystals penetrating limpid quartz when cut affords the Venus hair stone, fléche @Vamour, ov love's arrows. Rutile occurs in granite, gneiss, mica, slate, and syenitic rocks, occasionally in granular limestones.
One hundred parts contain: Titanium, 60.98; oxygen, 39.02.
This mineral is occasionally cut as a collector’s gem. Its color is velvety black; luster, submetallic and shining; hardness, 5.5; specific gravity, 5.68; color, opaque.
Scapolite occurs in tetragonal crystals and massive; luster, vitreous to pearly, occasionally resinous; color, white, gray, blue, green, and red, usually of faint shades; hardness, nearly 6; specific gravity, 2.7.

The variety wilsonite is of a rich purplish-red color and takes a good polish. Scapolite is usually found in crystalline rocks and in granular limestone, more commonly near granite contacts.
Serpentine admits of a high polish and is often employed as a material for ornaments, vases, etc. Its hardness is about 4; specific gravity, 2.5; luster, resinous to greasy; color, dark green, and blackish green to oil and siskin green, yellow, and white; frequently clouded with green of various shades and occasionally mottled with red. Bowenite is a cream-colored variety resembling nephrite and having a hardness of 5. = W7//éamsite is of a rich blackish oil-green color, often having chromic iron disseminated through it, giving it a mottled appearance. Verde antique is a serpentinous rock used as a marble. It is clouded with green of various shades and is extensively used for indoor ornamental work.
Serpentine often constitutes rock masses, and as such is the result of the alteration of an igneous rock composed largely of magnesian silicates.
One hundred parts of the mineral contain: Silica, 43.64; magnesia, 45.35; water, 13.01.
Smithsonite has a hardness of 5,a specific gravity of 4.45, and a vitreous to pearly luster. Color, white, often grayish, greenish, and brownish white; sometimes green, blue, orange yellow, brown, and pink. The rich-colored kinds are occasionally cut for cabinet gems.
Smithsonite is found in beds and veins associated with other zine minerals, galena, copper, and iron, usually in calcareous rocks.
One hundred parts contain: Oxide of zine, 64.81; carbonic acid, 55.19.
The fine blue-colored varieties of sodalite are cut cabochon for gem purposes. Hardness, 6; specific gravity, 2.29; luster, vitreous, inclining to greasy. Sodalite is met with in mica-slate, granite, gneiss, and certain eruptive rocks.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 37.2; soda, 19.1; chlorine, 7.3.
Spinel crystallizes in the isometric system, commonly in octahedrons. Its hardness is 8; specific gravity about 3.65; luster, vitreous. Color, red of various shades, passing into blue, green, yellow, brown, black, and occasionally nearly white. The mineral affords a wider range of color than any other gem. Following the order of the prismatic hues there are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and vio

let colored spinels; and also there are those showing a whole series of intermediate hues such as pink, heliotrope, lavender, lilac, purple, fawn, corn color, etc. The transparent, lively, red-colored spinels are called spinel rubies, and may readily be taken for the true ruby, though its small refractive and dispersive power together with the absence of pleochroism render it less brilliant than and lacking the fire of the red corundums. The rose-red to pink-colored kinds are called balas ruby ; the yellow or orange-red spinels are known as ruh7celle; the violet and purple ones as almandine,; the pale to sapphireblue kinds as sapphirine,; the blacks as pleonast

Spinel occurs embedded in granular limestone, and with calcite in serpentine, gneiss, and allied rocks; occurring also in cavities in the ejected masses of certain voleanoes. Found also as rolled pebbles in certain alluvials, such as those of Ceylon and Burma, where it occurs in water-worn masses of fine colors in the channels of streams along with quartz, garnet, tourmaline, sapphire, zircon, and other gem minerals. Spinel ruby is frequently found along with the ruby corundum in the crystalline limestone of the ruby mines of Burma. Most of the gem spinel comes from Ceylon, Burma, Siam, India, and other

<<<Page: 785>>>

Eastern countries. Small crystals of good color are found in the gembearing gravel of Expailly, France. The old lavas of Monte Somma, Italy, afford small black crystals of great brilliancy. A pale blue to pearl gray kind is found in the limestone near Aker, Sweden. From Amity, New York, to Andover, New Jersey, a distance of about 30 miles, is a region of granular limestone and serpentine in which localities of spinel abound, the crystals sometimes being fine enough to afford green, black, brown, and, less commonly, red gems. The localities near Franklin, New Jersey, afford crystals of various shades of black, blue, green, and red, which will occasionally afford small gems.
Spinel, when pure, contains essentially 28 parts of magnesia and 72 parts of alumina per 100; the magnesia, however, may be, and often is replaced by oxides of iron, zinc, manganese, or lime. These replacements give rise to several varieties known as automolite and gahnite, zine spinels, having a dark green to black color and a specific gravity of 4.1 to 4.9. Ceylonite, an iron magnesia spinel, usually black in color, and having a density of 3.57. Chlorospinel, a magnesia, iron, and alumina spinel, having a grass-green color and a specific gravity of 3.59. Dysluite, a zinc, manganese, and iron spinel, having a yellowish or grayish brown color with a specific gravity of 4.55. Hercynite, an iron spinel, having a specific gravity of 3.9.
Transparent spodumene affords gems varying in color from green of several shades, straw yellow to yellowish white, faint reddish to amethystine, and colorless. The mineral occurs in monoclinic crystals of a prismatic habit and in cleavable masses. Its hardness is 6.5 to 7. Specific gravity, 3.18. Cleavage, prismatic and perfect. Fracture, uneven; brittle. Luster, vitreous; somewhat pearly on cleavage surfaces.
Hiddenite, or lithia emerald, is a variety of spodumene varying in color from a yellowish green to a deep emerald green tinged with yellow, the colors of the crystal usually being yellow at one extremity and a more or less deep green at the other. The deeper colored kinds afford a gem resembling the emerald but having a greater variety of color because of its strong pleochroism. The mineral occurs in slender prismatic crystals one-half inch to 2 inches in length, affording small gems only, the largest being under 3 carats in weight. Hiddenite is at present known from but one locality, Stony Point, Alexander County, North Carolina, where it is found in metamorphic rocks, generally gneiss or mica schist, in veins of kaolin. The associated minerals are quartz, mica, rutile, beryl, and feldspar.
Most of the gem spodumene proper comes from the province of

Staurolite is occasionally used as a gem. It occurs in orthorhombic erystals of a prismatic habit, often cruciform from twinning. Color, dark reddish brown to brownish black. Hardness, 7.5; specific grayity, 3.7. The transparent kinds when cut resemble garnets. From their resemblance to a cross, the twinned forms are used to quite an extent as ornaments and charms, a use based to a certain degree upon the belief that they fell from heaven. Staurolite occurs commonly embedded in schist and gneiss.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 29.3; alumina, 53.5; peroxide of iron, 17.2..
The thomsonite, and a variety, lintonite, occurring as amygdules in the basalt and as rolled pebbles on the beaches of Lake Superior, find a limited use as gem minerals. The pebbles vary in size from that of a pea to a hickory nut, and are often made up of a series of concentric iayers of various shades of color, flesh red and other reds, green, yellow, and white; affording, when polished, an attractive ornament resembling the eye agate. Hardness, 5.5; specific gravity, 2.4; luster, vitreous, inclining to pearly.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 37.4; alumina, 31.8; lime, 13; soda, 4.8; water, 13.
Titanite, or sphene, is employed to some extent as a gem mineral. Its hardness is 5.5; specifie gravity, 3.5; luster, vitreous; color, brown, gray, yellow, green, and black; possessing strong refractive and dispersive powers on light. The transparent and colorless, greenish or yellowish kinds when cut show a great deal of fire and present an appearance approaching that of the fire opal.
One hundred parts contain: Silica, 30.45; titanic oxide, 41.33; lime, 28,22
Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombie system, occurring commonly in prismatic forms having the prism faces more or less striated vertically; also occurring massive. The mineral has a highly perfect basal cleavage, i. e., transverse to the length of the prism; a hardness of 8;

a specific gravity of 3.5 to 3.65; becomes strongly electric by friction, heat, or pressure, remaining in that condition for some time, a characteristic so marked as to afford a valuable means for its discrimination; a vitreous luster: a strong double refraction; and, in colored kinds, a marked pleochroism.
The colors of the topaz include wine, amber, honey, and straw-yellow, pale blue to pale green of several shades, grayish, reddish, and white. Colorless specimens, especially the rolled pebbles, are peculiarly limpid, hence the name gouttes @eau. (Fig. 13.) The best colorless topazes have considerable fire, and, when properly cut, exhibit brilliant reflec-

The rosepink topaz is probably not known in nature, the delicate tint being commonly obtained by heating the yellow or brown colored kinds. The process of ** pinking” is quite simple. Theselected stone is packed in magnesia, asbestus, or lime, and carefully heated to a low red heat, ‘are being taken that the temperature is raised gradually; the stone is then allowed to slowly cool. If the temperature reached has been sufficiently high, the desired rose-petal tint is obtained; if not high enough, a salmon tint; if too high or too long continued, the color is lost completely.

There are several distinct minerals which are commonly called topaz, the yellow sapphire known as the ‘‘ oriental topaz,” the topaz proper, — and certain colored kinds of quartz, known as ‘‘Saxon,” ‘*Scotech,” ‘*Spanish,” ‘*smoky,” and ‘false topaz.” These stones vary rather widely in hardness and specific gravity, which, together with the power of developing frictional electricity (possessed by the true topaz) furnishes a ready means for their discrimination. Thus:

Topaz occurs in gneiss or granite, associated with tourmaline, mica, beryl, etc., and occasionally with apatite, fluorite, and cassiterite; occurring also in certain taleose rocks, in mica slate, in rhyolite, and in alluvial deposits and drift.
In composition the mineral is a fluo-silicate of alumina, containing in 100 parts: Silicon, 15.5; aluminum, 30.2; oxygen, 36.8; fluorine, laren?
The tourmaline crystallizes in the rhombohedral division of the hexagonal system. The crystals are commonly prismatic in habit, and often slender to acicular. The prismatic faces are strongly striated longitudinally, giving a rounded, barrel-shaped, or triangular appearance to the crystal. The crystals are sometimes isolated, but occur more commonly in parallel and radiating groups. The mineral also occurs massive, compact, or in parallel to divergent, columnar shapes. Hardness, 7 to 7.5; specific gravity, 2.94 to 3.3; luster, vitreous; transparent to opaque, and unlike in transparency across the prism and in the line of the axis; becomes electric by friction. Color, black, brown, blue, green, red, and white; some specimens red internally, and green externally; others red at one extremity and green, blue, or black with intermediate shades at the other; dichroism marked.
The question of color is of interest. Some specimens are of one color only; others are green at one extremity and red at the other; some are green, then yellow, red, and finally green; others are crimson, tipped with black, or dark green passing into blue. A crystal may be white at the termination; then green of varying shades, pink and colorless, and in cross section dark blue or red at the center, surrounded by concentric layers of white, pink, and green. Another specimen may be red internally, passing into a lighter hue and finally

green; or it may be blue or black internally, then red, and then green externally. In some specimens the different colors pass imperceptibly into one another; in others the line of demarcation is well defined.
The colorless tourmalines are called Achrozte; to.the black the names Apirizite and Schorl are applied; the blues, either pale, indigo, or blackish blue, are called Jndicolite; this also includes the kinds known as Brazilian sapphire having a transparent Berlin-blue color; the red tourmalines, varying from a fine ruby red to violet red (siberite) and pale rose red or pink, are called /2uhellite.
The optical structure of the tourmaline is unique. When a crystal is viewed along the direction of its vertical axis it is less transparent and of different color than when viewed across that axis. For instance, a erystal viewed through the side is a transparent green, but when viewed through the end of the prism it may be either opaque or yellow green.
The marked pleochroism of the colored tourmalines influences to a great degree the appearance of the fashioned stone. For example, if a green-colored specimen is cut so that the table is parallel with the vertical axis of the crystal, the gem will exhibit a play and interchange of colors of two shades of green; if, however, the specimen is so cut that the table of the fashioned stone is perpendicular to the vertical axis, the gem will appear more or less opaque and dark colored, and will exhibit its transparency and green coloring only when viewed across the girdle. Care should be taken, therefore, in fashioning the tourmaline that the table is parallel with the vertical axis of the crystal; further, the facets of the crown should be large and welldeveloped in order to exhibit to the utmost the differences of color for light transmitted in different directions as the gem is viewed from different positions.
In composition the tourmalines are very complex boro-silicates of aluminum, magnesium, iron, or alkalies, falling under four types: Lithia tourmalines, iron tourmalines, magnesia-iron tourmalines, and magnesia tourmalines.
The geological occurrence of the four types of tourmaline is of interest. The lithia group—which is often beautifully colored and affords the best gem material—is associated with soda and potash feldspar in pegmatite veins along with lepidolite and muscovite. The iron and the magnesia-iron groups, which are commonly black or brownish black, occur in granites, gneisses, schists, and also to a certain extent in pegmatites along with the lithia group. The magnesia group— commonly brown in color—occur chiefly in crystalline magnesian limestones associated with mica, pyroxene, scapolite, ete.
Tourmaline is usually found in granite, gneiss, or mica slate. It
occurs also in dolomite or granular limestone, and in certain contact

rocks near dikes of igneous rocks; also in rolled pebbles in alluvial — deposits. In the United States magnificent colored tourmalines have been — found in Maine at Auburn, Hebron, Norway, Andover, Rumford, Standish, and Paris. The more famous locality is at Mount Mica, near Paris. It was discovered in 1820 and is still yielding fine speci7 mens of red, green, and parti-colored tourmalines; some crystals are — over an inch in diameter, transparent ruby red within, surrounded by green, or red at one extremity and green at the other. One blue crystal found was nine inches long. The locality affords all of tht colored varieties, achroite, aphrizite, indicolite, and rubellite. Red and green tourmalines are found at Chesterfield, Massachusetts, in a granite vein with albite, uraninite, and pyrochlore; the crystals small ~ and curved, nearly opaque, and fragile; the green crystals, often with distinct prisms of red color inside, are found at this locality. At Goshen, Massachusetts, similar varieties occur, and the blue is met with in great perfection. At Haddam, Connecticut, in crystals in mica-slate with anthophyllite, also in granite with iolite, and also at the gneiss quarries, on the east side of the river. At Haddam Neck, in fine green, and parti-colored crystals affording magnificent gems. Near Gouverneur, New York, light and dark brown crystals, often highly modified. Good crystals are found in Pennsylvania at Newlin, Chester County, at London Grove, and Unionville. Fine stellate and divergent rubellites in lepidolite are found in San Bernardino County, California. In Canada magnificent greenish-yellow crystals occur in the limestone at Great Calumet Island; amber-colored ones at Fitzroy, Ontario; transparent brown at Hunterstown, Quebec; black at Bathurst and Elmsley, Ontario, and St. Jerome, Quebec. Small brilliant crystals found in decomposed feldspar, at Andreasberg in the Hartz, are of the Aphrizite variety. Rubellite and green tourmaline occur near Ekaterinburg in Siberia. The island of Elba yields pink, red, white, green, black, and parti-colored crystals. Brazil affords a large proportion of the specimens used for gems, and has been one of the great sources of supply for more than two hundred years. Ceylon, India, and Burma produce good gem material, the latter locality affording some magnificent rubellites, rivaling the ruby in color.
Turquoise occurs massive, reniform stalactitic or encrusting; in thin seams and disseminated grains; and in rolled masses. The hardness of the mineral is 6. Specific gravity about 2.75. Cleavage, none. Fracture, small conchoidal; rather brittle. Luster, somewhat waxy. Color, sky-blue, bluish green, apple-green, and greenish gray; the

<<<Page: 795>>>

color is liable to change, a fine blue stone becoming a verdigris or sickly green.
Turquoise of poor color is frequently given the approved robin’s-egg or peculiar bluish green tint by artificial means. Many of these sophistications can be detected by washing the stone in strong ammonia water, which will attack the coloring matter. The reagent does not affect the color of the true Persian turquoise, although soap and water

The best specimens, which generally do not lose their color easily, come from the vicinity of Nishaptir, Persia, where they occur in narrow seams and irregular patches in the brecciated portions of a porphyritic trachyte and the surrounding clay slate. Inferior specimens are found in Asia Minor, Turkestan, and the Kirghiz Steppes. In the United States, turquoise is found in a trachytic rock in the Los Cerillos Mountains, near Santa Fe; the locality was early worked by the Indians and has lately afforded some fine gems. Other occurrences are at Turquoise Mountain, Cochise County, and Mineral Park, Mojave County, Arizona; near Columbus, Nevada; at the Holy Cross Mountain, Colorado, and in Fresno and San Bernardino counties, California.
Chemicaliy, the turquoise is a hydrous phosphate of aluminum and copper and contains in 100 parts: Phosphoric acid, 30.9; alumina,
44.50; oxide of copper, 3.75; water, 19.
The compact massive kinds of variscite are occasionally cut for use asagem. The color of the mineral is a rich green of several shades, bright green, emerald, and bluish green. Hardness, 4; specific gravity, 2.6. It takes a high polish, and its strong rich colors would make it an attractive ornamental stone were it not so soft. The best variscite is found in compact nodular masses, locally called wtahite, near Lewiston, Cedar Valley, Tooele County, Utah.
Variscite contains in 100 parts: Phosphorous pentoxide, 44.9; alumina, 32.3; water 22.8.
Vesuvianite occurs in tetragonal crystals commonly of a prismatic habit and massive, either columnar or granular. Hardness, 6.5; specific gravity, 3.349 to 3.45. Luster, vitreous, often inclining to resinous. Color, brown to green, the latter frequently bright and clear and appearing of a different color when viewed across the lateral axis of the prism; occasionally sulphur-yellow, wine-yellow, pale blue, and black.

<<<Page: 796>>>

Vesuvanite was first found in the ancient Vesuvian lavas, and in the dolomite of Monte Somna. It occurs rather abundantly in granular limestone, serpentine, chlorite schist, gneiss, etc., frequently as a result of contact metamorphism. Its common associates are garnet, diopside, epidote, wollastonite, and titanite.
The name wesueanite is from the first known locality. /doerase is from €z00s, J see, and Kpaois, mixture, in allusion to the resemblance between its form and those of other minerals. Cyprine is the name applied to a pale blue kind occurring near Tellemarken, Norway.
One hundred parts of vesuvianite contain approximately: Silica, 39.6; alumina, 22.5; lime, 32.6; iron, 5.3.
Anhydrous silicate of zinc has a hardness of 5.5; aspecific gravity of 3.9; and a vitreo-resinous luster. Sufliciently transparent specimens affording fair cabinet gems have been found at Franklin, Sussex County, New Jersey. The color varies from golden or greenish yellow, near that of chrysoberyl, to a canary-yellow. The mineral is commonly opaque and of a brown, apple-green, or flesh-red color, and at Franklin is usually mixed with zincite and franklinite.
Zircon crystallizes in the tetragonal system, occurring commonly in square prisms; also in irregular forms and grains. Its hardness is 7.5; specific gravity, commonly 4.7, sometimes as low as 4.2, or as high as 4.86; luster, adamantine; double refraction, strong. Its range of color includes green, red, brown, blue, yellow, all presenting many gradations of hue, to colorless. Its ‘‘ fire” is second only to that of the diamond, and this, together with its brilliant luster and range of rich and delicate tones of color, makes it an attractive gem.
The zircon includes the gems known as hyacinth, or jacinth and jargon or jargoon. The hyacinth includes the reddish, brownish, and orange-red specimens; the jargon the yellowish, smoky, and colorless kinds. 2
Zircon occurs in crystalline rocks such as granular limestone in gneiss, granite, and syenite; in chlorite and other schists, and in alluvial deposits derived from them.
Cheinically it contains in 100 parts: Zirconia, 67.2; silica, 32.8.

NV. THEO Circ. Or GEM. SCONES.
The cutting of gem stones is necessary for the complete development of those properties upon which their beauty largely depends. Rarely does the gem stone, as found in nature, present those qualities which make it attractive to the eye. In its natural state it is often opaque, dull, or flawed, and even if transparent and flawless its form is rarely adapted to the display of those characters which distinguish the fashioned stone. Occasionally a gem stone may, without artificial treatment, show to a sufficient degree those qualities which give it rank; but such cases are rare, and in order that its inherent beauty may be developed to the maximum it should be cut and polished.
The several styles of cut may all be brought under one or the other of the following heads: I. Those bounded by plane surfaces only. — II. Those bounded by curved surfaces only. III. Those bounded by both eurved and plane surfaces. The several examples under the above heads may be tabulated thus:
I. Bounded by plane surfaces:
Brilliant cut. Double brilliant or Lisbon cut. Half brilliant or single cut. Trap or split brilliant cut. Portuguese cut. Star cut. Rose cut, or briolette. Step brilliant or mixed cut. Table cut.
II. Bounded by curved surfaces: Double cabochon cut. Single cabochon cut. Hollow cabochon cut.
Ill. Bounded by curved and plane surfaces—mixed cabochon cut.
The brilliant cut may be described as two truncated pyramids, placed base to base. The upper pyramid is called the crown, and is so truncated as to give a large plane surface; the lower one, called the pavalion, terminates almost in a point. The line of union of the two pyramids is called the g7rd/e, and is the widest part of the stone. This fashion of cut, though occasionally modified as to the size, mutual proportions, and even the number of facets, requires, when perfect, 58 facets. The uppermost facet is called the crown, and is formed by removing one-third of the thickness of the fundamental octahedron; the lowermost facet is called the eu/et, or collet, and is formed by removing one-eighteenth of the thickness of the stone (a and 4, in text fig. 14). The triangular facets touching the table (s in ¢, fig. 14) are called star facets; those touching the girdle fall into two groups,

<<<Page: 808>>>

skill facets (E in ce) and skew facets (Dine). The corner facets touching the table and girdle on the crown (B in c), and the culet and girdle on the pavilion (Q in @) are called guoms. The facets between the quoins, and touching the table and girdle when on the crown, and the culet and girdle when on the pavilion, are called, respectively, bezel

facets (A in c) and pavilion facets (P in d). The total number of facets are distributed as follows: 1 table, 16 skill facets, 16 skew facets, 8 star facets, 8 quoins, 4 bezel facets, 4 pavilion facets, and 1 culet, as shown in c, d, and ¢ of the text figures, representing the top, side, and bottom views of a brilliant with 58 facets. Occasionally the cut is modified by cutting extra facets around the culet, making 66 in all,

<<<Page: 809>>>

The brilliant cut is especially applied to the diamond, and when perfect should be of the following proportions: From the table to the girdle, one-third, and from the girdle to the culet two-thirds of the total. The diameter of the table should be four-ninths of the breadth of the stone. When applied to other stones these proportions are more or less modified to suit their individual optical constants.

The double brilliant, or Lisbon cut, is a form with two rows of lozenge-shaped facets, and three rows of triangular-shaped facets, 74 in all. The figure shows top (a), side (4), and bottom (c) views of this fashion.
The half brilliant, single, or old English cut is the simplest form of the brilliant, and is generally employed for stones too small to admit

of numerous facets. The figure shows top (a) and side (4) views of this style of cut. Occasionally the top is cut so as to form a star (¢ in fig. 16) and then called English single-cut.

stone; from the table spring six equilateral triangles, whose apices touch the girdle, and these triangles, by the prolongation of their points, form a star.
The rose cut differs from the brilliant cut in that the crown consists of triangular or star facets, whose apices meet at the point or crown of the rose. The base lines of these star facets form the base lines for a row. of skill facets whose apices touch the girdle, leaving spaces

which are each cut into two facets. The base may be flat or the bottom may be cut like the crown, making a double rose or briolette cut. The shape of a rose-cut stone may be circular, oval, or indeed any other that the rough gem may permit.
In the trap or step cut the facets run longitudinally around the stone from the table to the girdle and from the girdle to the culet. There are usually but two or three sets of step facets from the table

to the girdle, while the number of steps from the girdle to the culet depends upon the thickness and color of the stone. The fashion is best adapted to emeralds and other colored stones.

cabochon is a characteristic cut for the turquoise. The hollow cabochon is adapted to very deep colored transparent stones. The mixed cabochon has either the edge or side faceted, or both. In all of the cabochon cuts the arches may be of a varying degree of flatness,
depending upon the nature of the stone.
Vic IMITATIONS, SOPHISTICATIONS, AND ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF GEMS.
Practically all of the gem stones have been and are successfully imitated. Deceptions are practiced by means of imitations, pure and simple; or by combining a genuine stone with an imitation, or an inferior one with a superior; by substituting one stone for another; or by intensifying, improving, or changing the color of a stone.
The basis of most imitation gems is a lead glass of great brilliancy called paste or strass. Its composition varies considerably, but a typical mixture is the following:
Pure powdered quartZssce. 2. 22225-2505 38. 2 Redbleads seat e tates tae a NG Se 53.3 Eotassium! carbonates] 2 cess. cee eee 7.8
The materials are carefu'ly powdered, mixed, and heated in a crucible. The temperature is gradually raised to fusion and carefully kept at that point for about thirty hours, after which it is very slowly lowered. The value of the product depends entirely on the intimacy of the previous admixture, the regularity of temperature, the duration of fusion, and the slowness of cooling.
Initation diamonds are cut from the uncolored paste, but for the imitation of colored gems the desired color isimparted by the solution of certain metallic oxides and other substances in the paste, some of the more typical mixtures being given in the following table:'

These proportions admit of considerable variation. For example, borate and chloride of silver are added to produce topaz yellow; or the first mixture given for topaz is, after fusion, mixed with 8 parts of strass and re-fused for thirty hours and used as a ruby glass. The ruby composition is colorless ana only acquires its color upon re-fusion, the depth of color being varied by the addition of compounds of tin.
These imitations can, as a rule, be readily detected. They are deficient in hardness and yield readily to the file. Further, they are liable to tarnish in impure air, are not pleochroic as the majority of colored gems are, and under the magnifying glass they show the many lines, strie, and bubbles characteristic of fused glassy masses. Finally they differ in specific gravity from the gems they represent.
Instead of a purely imitative preparation being used, what is known as a ‘‘doublet” may be constructed’ The doublet is made up of the table and crown of a genuine stone, usually somewhat off-colored, cemented to a pavilion made of a paste having the approved color, thus giving the valueless crown the appearance of a fine stone. The doublet usually betrays itself by the softness of its pavilion. To avoid this the ‘‘triplet” has been devised. This consists of a crown and pavilion made usually from a pale or off-colored stone with a thin layer of colored glass at the girdle. Here the hardness test will be found wanting and the magnifying glass and specific gravity test must be used. The glass usually distinguishes the composite nature of the triplet, and if soaked in alcohol, carbon bisulphide, or ether, the fraud will usually betray itself by falling to pieces.
The manufacture of imitation pearls by coating the inner surfaces of glass beads with a preparation made from the scales of certain fishes is extensively carried on as a home industry in the glass-making centers of Europe. The manufacture of the fish-scale extract, as carried on in Thuringia, is substantially as follows: Four to five pounds of bleak scales (obtained from the Baltic) are washed in fresh water to remove dirt; they are then churned for about two hours in six quarts of cold fresh water and the whole subjected to pressure in alinen bag. The silvery, lustrous running are caught and set aside and the operation repeated until the scales have lost their silvery appearance. The runnings, to which a little ammonia has been added, are put aside to clarify, care being taken to prevent putrefaction. The sediment is washed repeatedly with fresh water and left to settle. When the washings are quite clear, the lustrous sediment is bottled with its own volume of alcohol, shaken, and allowed to settle. The alcohol is then decanted off and the operation repeated until the sediment has lost its water and has the — consistency of butter. For use, the preparation is mixed, in small quantities, with a hot aqueous solution of gelatin to which a small amount of alcohol has been added. Colored pearls are made from it by the addition of the desired coal-tar dyestutff. NE

Sophistications include substitutes pure and simple, such as substituting quartz, white topaz, zircon, or other colorless stones for the diamond, and so on. Or the stone may be treated with chemicals or heat to heighten or change its color. Topaz, sapphire, and other stones may have their color removed or their brilliancy increased by heating. The color of the wine-yellow Brazilian topaz is changed to a rose pink by heat; an off colored or spotted diamond is made to appear whiter and more brilliant by the same means. The color of the cairngorm, citrine quartz, and other stones is altered and improved ina similar manner. The color of the turquoise is deepened and its permanency increased by treating it with solutions of certain chemicals. The colors of agates, chalcedony, chrysoprase, ete., may be changed or improved with the aid of dyes and chemicals, and in a similar manner imitation moss agates may be manufactured from colorless chalcedony. An off colored diamond may be given a wash of aniline blue, and the result is apparently a stone of good water as long as the wash remains. ‘The interior of a setting may be backed, painted, or enameled; in fact, there are a hundred or more methods by means of which a tint is improved or given a beauty and depth not inherent in the specimen.
A sharp distinction is to be drawn between the imitation of a gem stone and its formation by artificial methods. The imitation gem only simulates the natural substance; the artificial gem is identical with it in all its chemicaland physical properties. Until recently the laboratory gem was hardly more than a curiosity, though its synthesis has undoubtedly been of value from a theoretical standpoint. Examples of this class are to be found in the diamond as produced by Moissan in the electric furnace and the synthesis of spinel and chrysoberyl by Ebelmen from mixtures of alumina and glucina, respectively, using boric acid at very high temperatures as a solvent. Hydrofluoric acid and silicon fluoride have also been used to induce combination between silica and other oxides. In this manner topaz, a complex fluo-silicate, has been made by the action of fluoride of silicon upon alumina.
The minerals thus formed have usually been very small and of no commercial value. Quite recently, however, rubies have been produced by the fusion of alumina with traces of chromium oxide in the electric furnace, and the art has progressed to such an extent that the product is now on the market for sale as watch jewels. The electric furnace has also produced another product which, while strictly speaking, not a synthetic gem, yet is essentially an artificial one. Imperfect rubies, chips, and small stones are fused in the furnace together with the addition of a small amount of coloring oxide such as chromium. The fused product is then cut and polished, and the result is a ruby of good color and fairly large size. Emeralds and other colored stones have been made in the same way, and so promising has the industry

become that the courts have been called in to decide what constitutes a ruby. Their decision was in substance that the word ruby could be applied only to the red-colored corundum, anhydrous oxide of aluminum occurring ready formed in nature.
VIL. GEMS OF THEY BSrsee:
The Bible contains three lists of gems. The first of these is an account of the jewels on the ephod of Aaron. The ephod is described as having a front part and a back part fastened at each shoulder with an onyx mounted in gold and engraved with the names of the children of Israel, six on each stone, to memorialize the Lord of the promise made to them.
The following lists taken from Biblical antiquities by Adler and Casanowicz' give the names of these stones in the original and in the Septuagint, together with the meaning adopted by most authorities, the rendering of the Revised Version, both in text and margin being added in parentheses:
1. Odem (sardion), carnelian | 2. Pitdah (topazion), topaz or | 3. Bareketh (smaragdos), smar(sardius, ruby). peridot. agd or emerald (carbuncle
emerald).
4. Nofek (anthrax), cabenaies 5. Sappir (sapfeiros), sapphire | 6. Yahalom (iaspis), onyx, a probably the Indian ruby or lapis lazuli (sapphire). kind of chaleedon (diamond, (emerald, carbuncle). J sardonyx).
7. Leshem (ligyrion), jacinth, | 8. Shebo (achates), agate. 9. Achlamah (amethystos), others, sapphire (jacinth, amethyst. amber).
10. Tarshish (chrysolithos), | 11. Shoham (beryllion), beryl | 12. Yashpeh (onychion), jasper. chrysolite, others, topaz, (onyx, beryl). (beryl, chaleedony).
In many instances the equivalent of the Biblical names of gems is uncertain in the nomenclature of modern mineralogy, and as a consequence there are several distinct lists of names given for the stones in the breastplate. In the Division of Oriental Religions in the U. 8S. National Museum is a very old silver breastplate employed as an ornament for the manuscript copy of the Torah, or Pentateuch, used in an ancient synagogue. The twelve stones, with the names of the twelve’ tribes, according to it are as follows: Garnet, Levi; diamond, Zebulon; amethyst, Gad; jasper, Benjamin; chrysolite, Simeon; sapphire,

a keep ars i .-
Judah; topaz, Dan; beryl, Asher. The second list is that given in the description of the ornaments of the Prince of Tyrus As in the preceding list, the word used in the original or Septuagint is followed by the rendering given by most authorities, that of the Revised Version in parentheses:
1. Taspis, jasper. 2, Sapfeiros, sapphire or lapis | 3. Chalkedon, chalcedony. lazuli. 4. Smaragdos, smaragd (emer| 5. Sardonya, sardonyx. 6. Sardios, sardius. ald). | 7. Chrysolithos, chrysolite. lags Beryllos, bery1. 9. Topazion, topaz. 10. Chrysoprasos, chrysoprase. 11. Hyakinthos, jacinth (sap| 12. Amethystos, amethyst. phire).
In addition to the gems enumerated in these lists, there is mentioned the diamond by the Hebrew name of shamir ; amber, Hebrew Aashmal (margin of Revised Version gives electrum) , and crystal (quartz) Hebrew gerah and gabish .
The complete list of gems mentioned being as follows:
Agate (Hebrew shebo).—One of the stones in the breastplate of judgment, Exodus xxviii, 19.
Amber (Hebrew hashmal).—Ezekiel i, 4. Some render the Hebrew leshem as amber, thus making it one of the gems in the breastplate, Exodus xxvii, 19. Amethyst (Hebrew ahlamah).—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 19. In Revelation xxi, 20, it is mentioned as garnishing the twelfth foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem.
Beryl (Hebrew shoham).—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 20. Mentioned as one of the ornaments of the King of Tyre, Ezekiel xxviii, 13. In Revelation it is spoken of as adorning the eighth foundation of the Holy City.
Carbuncle (Hebrew nofek).—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii,
18; see also Ezekiel xxviii, 13. The word nofek has been rendered ruby. Carnelian, perhaps the Hebrew odem of the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 17, and the sardius in Revelation xxi, 20. In Revelation iv, 3, of the revised version is the rendering sardius. In the Authorized Version the reading is: ‘‘And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone.”’ In the Vulgate: ‘‘ Et qui redebat similis erat aspectui lapidis jaspidis et sardinis.’? The Textus receptus (Greek) is: “Kai 6 KaSnpevos nv bpor0s OpaGet ALS @ @a6m161 Kai Gapdivw.’’ All other editions have for the last word, ‘‘6apdiw.’’ Itisevidentthat the Vulgate and the Authorized Verson simply followed the Textus receptus, and that the correct rendering is “‘sardius’’ and not ‘‘sardine stone.”

<<<Page: 818>>>

Chalcedony.—The Hebrew tarshish, Exodus xxviii, 20, has been rendered chalcedony. In Revelation xxi, 19, it is enumerated in the description of the foundation of the New Jerusalem.
Chrysolite.—See Revelation xxi, 20. The Hebrew tarshish, Exodus xxviii, 20, has been rendered chrysolite.
Chrysoprase.—One of the stones in fhe foundation of the Heavenly City, Revelation xxi, 20.
Diamond, Hebrew shamir.—See Jeremiah xvii, 1; Ezekiel iii, 9; and Zechariah vii, 12, where it is spoken of as an object of extreme hardness. In the Authorized Version the Hebrew yahalom, Exodus xxviii, 18, is rendered diamond. :
Emerald, Hebrew bareketh.—One of the stones in the breastplate; also see Revelation iv, 3.
Jacinth, Hebrew leshem.—A stone in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 19. The eleventh foundation of the Heavenly Jerusalem, Revelation xxi, 20.
Jasper, Hebrew yashpeh.—A stone in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 20. Mentioned as adorning the Prince of Tyrus, Ezekiel xxviii, 18. One of the stones enumerated in the description of the Heavenly City, Revelation xxi, 19.
Onyx, Hebrew shoham.—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 20; see also Genesis, ii, 12; and Ezekiel xxviii, 13. According to certain renderings the shoham is beryl. Shohams set in gold were put on each of the two shoulder straps of the ephod of the high priest, and the two were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes, six on each, Exodus xxviii, 12.
Ruby, Hebrew nofek or odem.—One of the gems in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 17; see also Ezekiel xxvii, 13.
Sapphire, Hebrew sappir.—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 18; also mentioned in Ezekiel xxviii, 13, and Revelation xxi, 19. Some authorities render sappir as lapis lazuli, and not sapphire.
Sardonyx, Hebrew yahalom.—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus Xxviii, 18.
Topaz, Hebrew pitdah.—One of the stones in the breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 17; also mentioned in Ezekiel xxviii, 13, and in Revelation xxi, 20.
Pearl.—It is thought that pearl is meant by the Hebrew peninim, a word often employed in the Old Testament as a figure of something valuable and precious; see Proverbs iii, 5; xxxi, 10, and Job xxviii, 18. Jesus uses the pearl for the same purpose in Matthew vii, 6, and xiii, 45. /
Man has endowed gems with talismanic, curative, and supernatural powers. Certain gems preserved him from incubi, vampires, and kindred terrors; others preserved him from the powers of sorcery or conferred the powers of witchcraft; by their aid he controlled the spirits of evil or was protected from their malign influence. With a suitable gem he could foretell the future, review the past, or conjure up pictures of events taking place at a distance. Protected by their mystic influences he feared neither plague nor poison, while his belief in the marvelous efficacy of their curative powers gave them a place among his most potent remedies.
The virtues of gems were diverse. Some procured the favor of the great; others rendered their possesso1s amiable, wise, strong, and brave; some protected him from fire, lightning, and tempests; others from

——_—
danger and disease; some were preferred as talismans and charms; others were used as drugs, either alone or with electuaries, and with or without prayers, incantations, or other prescribed formulas.
Certain gems brought good or evil through the planetary influence of certain days. All yellow gems were appropriate for Sunday wear through the name giver, the sun. On Monday, the moon day, all white stones, except the diamond, were to be worn. Tuesday, the day of Mars, claimed garnets, rubies, and all red stones. Wednesday demanded blue stones. Thor’s day, or Thursday, required amethysts and other stones of a sanguine tint. Friday, the day of Venus, had for its gem the emerald. Saturn’s day claimed the diamond.
A particular stone was potent for good during a particular month, and, under the proper astrological control, was supposed to have a mystical influence over the twelve parts of the human anatomy. Such a gem was the more potent if the natal day of the wearer corresponded with its particular sign, and when worn as a birth or month stone was supposed to attract at all times propitious influences and avert malign effects. The more important stones, their zodiacal control, and most potent periods of influence are:

A closely related idea is found in the twelve stones which, according to the Jewish cabalists, when engraved each with an anagram of the name of God were supposed to have a mystical power over, and a prophetical relation to, the twelve angels. Thus:

These stones also had reference to the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve parts of the human body, twelve hierarchies of devils, ete. By — their aid a system of prognostication was practiced, based upon the change of hue or brilliancy of the stone, so that the cabalist was enabled to foretell future events.

also averted the evil effects of adverse astral influences by wearing certain stones. If the sun was adverse, the cat’s-eye; if the moon, the sapphire, ete.
The mystic ascribed a certain significance both to the gem and to its various colors. For example, white was the emblem of light, purity, faith, innocence, joy, and life; worn by women it was emblematic of chastity; by the ruler, of humility and integrity. Red signified pure love and wisdom; in another sense it signified passion, love of evil, hatred, etc. Blue was indicative of truth constancy, and fidelity. Yellow in one sense was symbolical of marriage and faithfulness; in another sense of inconstancy, jealousy, and deceit. Green was the color of hope, especially that of immortality. Amethystine signified love, truth, passion, suffering, and hopefulness, and among the Rosicrucians was symbolical of the divine male sacrifice.
Stones of all sorts were engraved with the figure of a cockatrice, which, under the proper planetary influence, were preservatives against the evileye. The names of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph were engraved on stones, chiefly amethyst, onyx, and bloodstone, which were worn as preventives of contagious diseases, the larger the stone, the greater its eficacy. Gems were also supposed to indicate the state of health of the donor or wearer. If the stone became dull, opaque, or colorless it was thought to be significant of danger and death. In a similar manner they lost or changed color in contact with poisons.
Dreaming of gems was usually fraught with good, while seeing or handling them on the eve of a journey, or at certain phases of the moon, was regarded as auspicious.
Supernatural influences have been attributed to gems which still pass current. For example, an onyx ring, supposed to be the espousal ring of Mary and Joseph, exhibited in the Duomo of Perugia, is thought to be efficacious in the cure of every disorder. Amber is still used as a prophylactic and curative for goiter, croup, and diseases of the throat. The opal is thought by many to bring ill luck to the wearer. The coral is still believed to be a charm against diseases of childhood, and is extensively worn in Italy as a protection against the ** evil eye.” Pearls are dreaded by some and favored by others. No French bride will wear them on her wedding day, since they would bring tears to her married life. In the East the believers are dogmatic in their faith and it is heresy to assert that the use of gems has no practical influence over body or mind.
It is impossible here to do more than hint at the many beliefs concerning gems which were or are current, and the following notes merely suggest a few of the more prevalent beliefs on this subject.
Agate.—Emblematic of health and wealth. An enemy to all venomous things; assauges thirst when held in the mouth; gives victory to its
wearer; repels storms; sharpens the sight; preserves and increases

<<<Page: 822>>>

564 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1900. : a
strength, and renders its wearer gracious and eloquent. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum, 1502.) Efficacious as an amulet against scrofula and skin diseases. (Albertus Magnus, De Vertutibus Herbarium, Lapidum, Animalum, etc.) Various properties are attributed to it by Mohammedan authorities. It cured insanity when administered with water or with the juice of the fruit Sheu (an apple’); a —
remedy for hemorrhage in the genital organs or in the rectum; for the spitting of blood; for the unusual discharge of the menstrual fluid. In conjunction with other medicines it cured hard boils and porous — ulcers, gravel, spleen, and kidney troubles. It prevented bleeding of the gums and rendered them hard when applied to the parts as a calcined powder. “§
Agates having the reddishness of the water after washing raw flesh in the shape of finger rings prevent bleeding of all kinds. The wearer strikes terror to the heart of his enemies, obtains his heart’s wishes from the gods, and becomes free from pain in the breast.
The Akik (agate) confers upon the wearer all the blessings that the use of the turquoise does. Its internal use may do harm to the stomach, but this can be avoided by mixing it with Katira, or, in its absence, with the Basud stone. (Views of Arabic and | Persian writers on gems and stones.)
lf taken internally, the agate drives away fear, increases the power of digestion, cures insanity and monomania of that kind which creates the impression of being beaten and abused by others. If worn, it cures stricture and the vomiting of blood coming fron the chest; worn on the neck, it cures the spitting of blood issuing from the lungs at the time of coughing. Calcined, powdered, and administered with white wine in doses weighing 16 barlevcorns, it cured the gravel. If tied about the thighs of a woman under painful labor, it helps to a speedy and easy delivery. The weight of the stone here prescribed should be about 120 barleycorns. (Ben Adloulah.)
The eye-agate vas considered efficacious as an amulet in cases of scrofula and other skin diseases. In great repute to-day in Syria as a curative for ‘‘Aleppo” sores.
Pierre de Boniface, writing in 1315, said:
The agate of India or Crete renders its possessor eloquent and prudent, amiable and agreeable.
Ben Jonson, in the Alchymist, speaking of the medicinal properties of gems, wrote:
My meat shall come in Indian shells, dishes of agate set in gold, and studded with emeralds, sapphires, hyacinths, and rubies. The tongues of carps, dormice, and camel’s heels boiled in the spirit of Sol, and dissoly’d pearl, apicus diet ‘gainst the epilepsy. And I will eat these broths with spoons of amber, headed with diamond and carbuncle.
Dioscorides, in his Materia Medica, recommends the use of the agate as a preventive of contagion.
Alabaster. —According to Leonardus, it is the best for vessels to hold unguents, which are preserved in them without spoiling. Dioscorides and many other doctors account it good in physicks. He who carries it will prove victorious in suits at law.

Amber.—Supposed to be ‘generated out of the urine of the lynx, and is hardened by time; that voided by the male, brown; by the female, saffron, inclining to a darkness.” Amber assuaged pain in the stomach, cured jaundice, flux, and king’s evil.
It naturally restrains the flux of the belly; is an efficacious remedy for all disorders in the throat (a belief still prevalent). It is good against poison. If laid on the breast of a wife when she is asleep, it makes her confess all her evil deeds. Being taken inwardly it provokes urine, brings down the menses, and facilitated a birth. It fastens teeth that are loosen’d, and by the smoke of it poisonous insects are driven away. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502. )
When buried in a moist soil it was supposed to generate a fungus, which was administered to those troubled with the gravel. It cured fits, dysentery, scrofula, and jaundice. Used as an amulet it charmed away toothache, asthma, croup, and diseases of the throat; supposed to be efficacious as a curative and prophylactic if rubbed on the parts or taken internally, after dissolving in white wine. (Dissertatio medica de Succino, 1682.) These beliefs are still current.
Thomas Nicols states that the— white odoriferous amber is esteemed the best for physic use, and thought to be of great power and force against many diseases, as against the vertigo and asthmatic paroxysmes, against catharres and arthriticall pains, against diseases of the stomach, and to free it from sluffings and putrefactions, and against diseases of the heart, against plagues, venoms, and contagions. It is used either in powder, or in oil, or in troches, either in distempers of men or of women, either married or unmarried, either with child or without, or in the distempers of children.
Olaus Worm, of Copenhagen, writing in 1640, says that amber was received as a panacea; a sovereign remedy for toothache, asthma, and dropsy.
In the work ** De Proprietatibus Rerum,” by Bartholomaeus Glanvilla, amber is reported to possess the property of driving away adders and of being contrary to friends.
The Shah of Persia is said to wear an amulet of amber reported to have fallen from heaven, and which has the property of rendering him invulnerable.
Amber is used to-day in Lombardy and the Piedmont as a cure for goitre, a belief that dates back to the time of Pliny.
Amethyst.—Emblematic of sincerity.
As an amulet it dispelled sleep, sharpened the intellect, prevented intoxication, gave victory to soldiers, and protected its wearer from sorcery. (Leonardus.)
** The amethyst banishes the desire for drink and promotes chastity.” (Art Magic; or Mundane, Submundane, and Supermundane Spiritism. )
Lost its color in contact with and was an antidote for all poisons. (Albertus Magnus.)
According to Pliny, the amethyst was an antidote to drunkenness,

<<<Page: 824>>>

and it takes its name from this property. Moreover, if the name of the moon or sun be engraved on it and it be thus hung about the neck from the hair of a baboon or the feathers of a swallow, it is a charm against witchcraft. It is also serviceable to persons having petitions to make to princes. With the assistance of a spell or incantation, it kept off hailstorms and flights of locusts.
Porta, in his treatise on magic, says that the amethyst neutralizes magic incantations.
The Puranas hold that the amethyst ‘‘gives strength and cures morbid heat and fistula.”
Beryl.—Used with incantations to foretell the future and review the past; was efficacious in detecting thieves, forewarned death, and was supposed to have power over and to be the abode of evil spirits that could be made to work the wearer’s will by means of suitable incantations. It rendered its owner cheerful, preserved and increased conjugal love, cured diseases of the throat and jaws and disorders ‘*proceeding from the humidity of the head, and is a preservative against them.” (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
According to Freeman, who wrote in 1701—
The beryl] disturbs devils beyond all others. If it be thrown in water with the words of its charm sung, it shews various images of devils and gives answers to those that question it. Being held in the mouth, a man may call a devil out of hell and receive satisfaction to such questions as he may ask.
Browning, in one of his poems, makes use of this belief.
The beryl! was largely used for divination in 1600. The method was as follows: A bowl was filled with water and the ring suspended in it. The answer to the question propounded was spelled out by the ring striking the sides of the vessel. A modification of this, and one still in use, was to mark the edges of the bowl with the letters of the alphabet; the stopping of the ring at certain letters composed the answer. Still another method, and one said to have been used by Napier, was to throw a sphere cut from the stone into a bowl of water. The character of the circles formed announced whether the presiding demon was favorable or not. If favorable, the information desired was pictured on the surface of the bowl. .
Prior to the seventeenth century the beryl was in some repute as a curative. Mixed with an equal weight of silver, its powder, taken internally, was thought to cure leprosy. Water in which the stone had stood was good for the eyes, and, taken internally, it dispelled flatulency. and cured indisposition of the liver.
Nicols, in the ‘‘Arcula Gemmea,” published in 1653, said:
Wurtzung, in his general practise, saith that the beryl! is used in all distempers of
the heart. But take this caution by the way: Beware of the use of gemms (unless you are sure they be true) in physick, by reason they are so frequently adulterated.
Bloodstone.
Symbolical of wisdom, firmness, and courage.

<<<Page: 825>>>

Used with the proper incantations, its owner was enabled to foretell the future, and if rubbed with the juice of the heliotrope, it rendered its wearer invisible. The stone brought safety and long life to its possessor, stopped the flow of blood, and was an antidote for poisons. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
Albertus Magnus taught that it cured dyspepsia, strengthened the stomach, and, if ‘* washed according to medicinal art,” was a styptic. Mixed with honey or the white of an egg, its powder was held by him to be an excellent remedy for hard tumors, while its dust would cure proud flesh and running sores.
Pliny and Leonardus mention that if placed in a basin of water containing the,juice of the heliotrope and set in the sun, the water will appear red and the sun bloody. After a time the water will apparently boil and overflow the basin. Taken out of the water, the sun and solar eclipses could then be viewed in the water as in a mirror.
Ina ‘*‘ Booke of the Thinges that are brought from the West Indies,” published in 1574, the statement is made—
They doo bring from the New Spain a stone of great virtue, called the stone of the blood. The Bloodstone is a kind of jasper of divers colours, somewhat dark, full of sprinkles like to blood, being of colour red, of the which stones the Indians dooth make certayne Hartes, both great and small. The use thereof both there and here is for all fluxe of bloode, and of wounds. The stone must be wet in cold water, and the sick man must take him in his right hand and from time to time wet him in cold water. And as touching the Indians, they have it for certayne that touching the same stone in some part where the blood runneth, that it doth restrain.
The bishop of Rennes, in the eleventh century, writing on the talismanic efficacy of stones, asserts that the bloodstone endows its bearer with the gift of prophecy and renders him proof against poison.
During the Middle Ages the belief was prevalent in Europe that the stone had its origin in a dark-green jasper which happened to lie at the foot of the cross at the time of the crucifixion, and upon which the blood of Christ fell, hence the red spots.
Carnelian.—According to Epiphanius, it cured tumors and _ all wounds made by iron.
It preserved the strength, prevented hoarseness, and cleared the voice. (Camillus Leonardus.)
It cheered the soul, banished fear and enchantments, and preserved harmony. (Albertus Magnus.)
According to the work by Gioy. B. Porta, the wearing of a carnelian insured victory in all contests save those of love.
As an amulet and as a powder it was supposed to be a sovereign remedy for hemorrhage. De Laet, in 1647, has described from a personal experience its power in stopping bleeding at the nose, and advises the wearing of rings cut entirely from the stone for this purpose. The belief in its efficacy in such cases still persists.

Cat’s-eye.—The cat’s-eye cheers the mind, cures pallor, brings on a safe delivery in case of protracted labor, especially if tied in the hair of a patient. Applied locally, it causes infants suffering from the croup to bring up phlegm.
Applied as an ointment to the eves, it cures lachryma. Calcined, _ the powder applied to sores heals them, and will cause new flesh to appear in the place of proud flesh. (Ben Adoulah.)
According to the Mani-Mala, ‘‘ the cat’s-eye is warm, sour, and curative of cold, chronic derangements of the spleen, and colic, and is generally auspicious when worn.” The same authority says that the perfect cat’s-eyes, which are ‘‘ heavy, deliciously cool, flawless, smooth, and otherwise faultless,” are considered very lucky, while those that are defective bring about loss of friends, ruin, and wasting of the body.
The Hindus group the cat’s-eye in four castes, according to their quality, all of which are replete with lucky signs.
The Persians held that the stone ground to a fine powder, mixed with water, and then dried in the sun, and the operation repeated until the powder soaks up four times as much water as was first put in, would cure dropsy and inflammation of the navel if applied locally.
The Assyrians dedicated the stone to the god Le/ws, and ornaments containing it would, after the proper religious ceremony, render its wearer invisible to his enemies.
Chalcedony.—Prevented and cured melancholy. Worn as an amulet and in contact with the hairs of an ass, it was a preventive of danger during tempests and sinister events. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
Reported to drive away evil spirits, a preventive of melancholy and sadness, and would bring victory to its wearer. (Andrea Baccius, Armot. Super. 6, c. de Natur. gem.)
Chrysoberyl.—As an amulet it dispelled evil dreams, fear, and melancholy; in addition, it possessed the properties of the beryl. (The Mirror of Stones. 1750.)
The oriental chrysolite (chrysoberyl) dispelled pestilential vapors and infectious airs. Taken internally, it alleviated asthma. (Rulandus, Medicina Practica. 1564.)
It was said to cool boiling water when immersed in it, soften anger, lose its luster on contact with poison, and induce its wearer to repent of the faults he had committed. (Porta, Magie Naturalis. 1561.)
According to the Mani-Mél4, the chrysoberyl, when set in gold and worn about the neck or hand, removes disease and vicious habits, and increases family, life, and happiness.
COhrysolite.—Cardanus, in his ‘‘de subtilitate,” says that he cured one ©. Palavicinus of a fever and another person of the ‘‘ falling sickness” by the administration of powered chrysolite with wine..
The powder was prescribed as a remedy for asthma. Héld under the tongue, it assuaged thirst in fever. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)

<<<Page: 827>>>

‘Chrysoprase.—Preserved the sight, banished covetousness, and rendered its wearer cheerful. (Mirror of Stones. 1750.)
Wornas an amulet, it assuaged the pains of gout. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
Bound around the arm, it was supposed to become a diuretic, to expel gravel, and prevent the generation of the stone. (Rulandus, Medicina Practica. 1564.)
Citrini.—The citrini (yellow corundum) protected the wearer from danger while traveling, secured him from pestilential vapors, and procured him every courtesy. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
Coral.—In the ‘*‘ Arcula Gemmea” is a rather interesting account of the coral, as follows:
This is a bud of maritime beauty, and the delight of children, the best of nature’s buds, as somewhat furthering the springtide of their growth. The corali is a plant of nature’s setting in the sea, which, though being covered with the waters of the sea, it bee green and soft, yet so soon as it is elevated above the waves and discovered in the region of the aire it altereth its colour and changeth its nature: its colour from green toa very noble and beautifull red; its softnesse into the compacted firmness and solidnesse of a stone, beautifull and lasting; by the operation of the aire encompassing its sometimes soft and flaccid substance. It is (under the waters of a brinish sea) a thriving, growing plant, sprung by nature with the ornament of many pretty branches, which is no sooner violently fore’d from the place of its growth and brought to light above the overflowing of the waters, but it blushes at the injurious hand that offereth violence to its secret, silent, tender, spreading growth.
Ovid, the Roman poet, accounts for the origin of the coral in the ** Metamorphoses” in the following manner: |
Perseus, having cut off the head of the Medusa, placed it upon some twigs and leaves near the seashore. The twigs were turned to stone on contact with the head, were scattered far and wide beneath the sez by sea nymphs, and thus became the seeds of coral. 2
The coral was thought to be of greater beauty when worn by a man than by a woman. By its change of color it was thought to forewarn the approach of disease; and should the wearer become dangerously sick, the gem became spotted. Wornasan amulet, it drove away fear, kept men from the influence of sorcery and evil spirits. It was a protection against poison, plague, and storm. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
It secured women from /nceubus and men succubus and hindered the delusions of the devil.
According to the ** Medicina Practica” of Rulandus, written in 1564, a half a drachm of powdered coral was given as a cardiac stimulant;

and in all contagious diseases, fevers, and poisonings the ‘‘tinctura corallorum” and the ‘‘sal corallorum” were equally efficacious.
Stopped every flux of blood; drove away ghosts, illusions, and dreams; was a protection against lightning, wind, tempest, and attacks of wild beasts. (Methrodorus.)
It gave relief to pains in the stomach and heart and strengthened those organs. It made sound diseased gums, and cleansed putrid sores. The powder, taken with wine, was given for the gravel. If hung on fruit-bearing trees, it insured fertility and protected them from hail and blighting winds. A kind known as Grogius had the power of stopping thunder and lightning. |
Before the time of Pliny coral was held in great esteem, but during — his period it was apparently not so highly appreciated, since he remarks ‘‘ that formerly it was deemed a most excellent antidote for poison.” During the Middle Ages, however, it was in great repute throughout Europe both as a drug and as an amulet. It was at that time deemed a powerful astringent, and in demand as a talisman against witchcraft, poison, epilepsy, ete.
Boetius de Boot, writing in 1636, says that he was cured of a dangerous pestilential fever by taking 6 drops of tincture of coral. A. de Villenevee prescribed 10 grains of coral for infants in order to preserve them from epilepsy or any other fit through life. It is still in repute as a preservative against children’s diseases and is not infrequently worn suspended from the neck for this purpose. In India it is occasionally given to children in the hope of ridding them of the hives and kindred itches.
According to the Mani-Mala a deep red coral was worn as an immediate cure for poisoning. Kar, an oriental sage, says that any man who wears an ugly discolored and rough coral courts death.
Sanskrit medical science taught that coral is sour, sweet, a specific for cold and biliousness, nutritious, and grace imparting; and the wearing of it very beneficial to women.
According to the Arabic and Persian writers, as given by Tagore in his Treatise on Gems, a dose of coral was considered to be a good astringent, a remedy for all bleedings, and an antidote for all poisons. Worn over the parts it cured all stomach complaints; worn around the neck it stopped crying in infants and protected them from fear and sudden starts while asleep. In Afghanistan the coral mixed with gold dust is given asa tonic. In Egypt it is used according to the following receipt:
Cut open a lemon and put a piece of coral inside, cover the opening with a paste of clay, and place the whole under a fire for some time until it gets white from burning; remove it and after grinding the stone use it as an ointment for the eyes. Mixed with electuaries and taken internally it will give great physical strength.

<<<Page: 829>>>

Porta, in his Magiae Naturalis, says that the coral will arrest the flow of blood and keep off evil spirits. This belief still persists in Italy where a hand holding a branch of coral is not infrequently worn as a protection against the evil eye.
Diamond.—This stone being of all gems the purest, hardest, and most brilliant, was considered to be the most powerful in spiritual influences and was consecrated to all that was holy and heavenly.
It was symbolical of constancy, purity, and innocence, and hence early used in betrothal rings. It softened anger, strengthened love, and was considered an infallible test of conjugal fidelity. To the ancients the diamond represented inexorable justice and unchangeable fate, hence the judges of Hades were described as having hearts and bosoms of adamant.
According to the Talmud, a certain gem, supposed to have been the diamond, worn in the girdle of the high priest, if brought in contact with an accused man became dark and dim if the suspect was guilty; if innocent the stone shone with increased brilliancy.
In Europe as late as 1700 the diamond was thought to be the most potent talisman against poison, pestilence, witchcraft, etc. It was esteemed a safeguard to virtue; was used as a preventive of and a cure for lunacy. It was supposed to drive away lemures, incubi, and kindred terrors; and was considered a preservative against lightning. The gem was supposed to possess sex, and Boetius de Boot mentions two such diamonds which by their union produced others and thus left a numerous progeny.
Sir John Mandeville also bears witness to the procreative powers of diamonds:
They grow together, male and female, and are nourished by the dew of heaven; and they engender commonly, and bring forth small children that multiply and grow all the year. I have oftentimes tried the experiment, that ifa man keep them with a little of the rock, and wet them with May dew often, they shall grow every year and the small will grow great.
Speaking further concerning the diamond, Mandeville held that in order to secure the greatest good from a diamond it should be worn on the left side.
For it is of greater virtue than on the right side; for the strength of their growing is toward the north, that is the left side of the world, and the left part of a man is when he turns his face toward the east. He who so carries the diamond upon him, it gives him hardness and manhood, and it keeps the limbs of his body whole. It gives him victory over his enemies, if his cause is just; and it keeps him that bears it in good wit; and it keeps him from strife and riot; from sorrows and enchantments; and from phantasies and illusions of wicked spirits. It makes a man stronger and firmer against his enemies; and heals him that is a lunatic, and those whom the fiend pursues or torments. And if venom or poison be brought in presence of the diamond, anon it begins to grow moist and sweat. Nevertheless, it happens often that the good diamond loses its virtue by sin, and for incontinence of him who bears it; and then it is needful to make it recover its virtue again, or else it is of little value.

<<<Page: 830>>>

Pierre de Boniface, a fourteenth century alchemist, taught that one of the virtues of the diamond was to render its wearer invisible and — invincible.
In this connection the Shah of Persia is the possessor of a diamond set in a scimitar which is believed to render him invincible so long as he has it by him. The shah also has a five-pointed star of diamonds which is thought to make conspirators instantly confess their crimes when in its presence.
A diamond ring was given to Mary Queen of Scots, by Ruthven, as a talisman against danger and poison. The queen also possessed two other diamonds—*‘ one medicinable and against poison,” the other ‘*medicinable for the collicke.”
According to the Puranas, the diamond varies in the preponderance of one or the other of the five primal elements—
Earth, water, sky, energy, and air. The ‘‘airy’’ sort gives heart and gracefulness, the ‘‘skyey’’ diamonds bring about the possession of all kinds of wealth. The ownership and use of those kinds in which energy predominates adds to puissance, heroism, and hope. Those diamonds which are white like the jessamine flower, white clouds, or the moon, and are possessed of six or eight corners, sharp ridged, that have originated from water, and that shine in the darkness, lead to the instant cure of snake bites, and prove efficacious in neutralizing the effects of other poisons, and prove a panacea as soon as worn.
Like men, diamonds are divided into castes, Brahmins, Vaisya, Kshatriyas, and Stdras. The wearing of superior Brahmin diamonds gives favor in the eyes of the gods. The better sort of the Kshatriya class bring about uniform success, accession of power, and destruction of foes. The best stones of the Vaisya class are productive of fame, wisdom, and skill in the fine arts. The higher order of the Stdra caste induce benevolence in their owner and make him hale and wealthy.
As the promiscuous intercourse of one caste with another gives rise to mixed castes among men, so it is with diamonds. These mixed castes give rise to impurities and flaws in the stones, and which, according to their nature and kind, are fraught with graye trouble toman. Such diamonds cause: Unchastity; brings destruction; renders man apprehensive of snake bites; creates fear; leads to ruin, loss of family dignity, and death. Such stones are dangerous to pregnant women and contact with them may lead to abortion.
A shapeless diamond is fraught with danger; a dirty diamond with grief; a rough diamond with unhappiness, and a black diamond with various troubles. A threecornered diamond gives rise to quarrels; a four-cornered diamond occasions various fears; a five-cornered one brings death; but a six-cornered stone is productive of gZOK rd.
Since the use of impure diamonds leads to.danger, causes swelling in wounds, faintness, leprosy, pleurisy, jaundice, ete., it is highly advisable to refine and purify the stone before using it medicinally.
The process is as follows: On some auspicious day dip the diamond in the juice of Kantakari (solarium jaquiri) and then burn it in a tire made of dried cow or buffalo dung. The burning should be carried on for a whole night. In the morning the diamond should be put under horse’s urine and again burnt. These operations are _ continued for seven days. The stone is then immersed in a gruel made of various leguminous seeds to which assafoedita and rock salt have been added and heated repeatedly twenty and one times. By this means the diamond is purified and reduced to ashes. The taking of a diamond so treated gives longevity, strength, energy, beauty, develops the parts, and effects a cure for every distemper. (Mani-Mala. )

<<<Page: 831>>>

The Brahmin diamond is useful in chemical operations, and brings about the acquisition of power, friends, wealth, position, and good luck to one’s family. A Kshatriya diamond wards off old age and premature death; a Vaisya one crowns every endeavor with success; while a Stdra one is a panacea.
The Hindu held that the diamond was masculine, feminine, or neuter according to its marking and appearance. ‘The masculine kinds were considered the best, and were useful in medicine. The feminine diamond was auspicious to women; but the neuter diamond was destructive of vigor and brought weakness and disappointment; as a medicine it was administered for impotency.
According to the views of Arabian and Persian authorities the diamond, if worn, imparted health and dispelled fear. Tied around 4 the thighs of a woman about to be confined it brought on a safe and 4 speedy delivery and assnaged the pain of labor. Cut into a hexagon |
and worn on the arm it cured epilepsy. Combined with other ingredients and used as a dentifrice it rendered the teeth bright and hard; ; its use in this manner was attended with risks, for on too long a § contact with the teeth it caused them to fall out; while the presence of a single particle in the stomach was liable to produce death. It was a fatal poison if taken internally without electuaries; and—
if by accident one takes a quantity of it his life should not be considered safe until he is made to yomit it out by means of drinking a quantity of fresh cow’s milk or some heated clarified butter, or by any other means, such as applying the fingers to the inside of the throat. The soup of some fatty flesh is then to be given to the patient to complete the recovery. (Tagore, Treatise on Gems.)
The Burmese call the diamond and arsenic by the same name, che/n, on the ground that they are both fatal poisons.
This idea was not unknown in Europe, for we find the diamond listed as one of the poisons given to Sir Thomas Overbury when a prisoner in the Tower; while Benvenuto Cellini, the famous goldsmith, writing about 1560, relates how his life was preserved by the roguery of an apothecary, who, being employed to pulverize a diamond intended to be mixed in a salad for Cellini with the intention of poisoning him, substituted a beryl as cheaper, thus saving the life of Cellini.
According to Sanskrit medicine the diamond combined all the six tastes, cured every disease, brought health and strength, and was very useful in chemical operations. (Mani-Mala.)
In Egypt the diamond, when set in gold, gives health and wealth to its wearer.
According to Porta, in his Magiae Naturalis, the diamond contends against sleeplessness, enchantments, and turns away wrath.
Rabbi Benoni, a fourteenth century mystic, held that the diamond was capable of producing somnambulism, and when used as a talisman
—7 es

with lodestone and sapphire it would attract such powerful planetary influences as to render its wearer almost invincible.
In Art Magic; or Mundane, Submundane, and Supermundane Spiritism, it is stated that the diamond is the most powerful of all stones to promote spiritual ecstacy.
Emerald.—Emblematic of happiness. As an amulet it was a preserver of chastity, and betrayed or punished its violation by flying into pieces or losing color. — It preserved women in childbirth and eased the pains of labor; water in which the stone had stood hastened the afterbirth. (Leonardus.) Applied to the lips it stopped hemorrhage. When hung around the neck it prevented epileptic attacks. (Albertus Magnus. )
Dedicated to Mercury.
Much used by,astrologers for the purposes of divination. (Cardanus, De Lapidibus Preciosis.)
Albertus Magnus cites the case of a certain King of Hungary who, while wearing an emerald, had knowledge of his wife, upon which the stone broke in three parts.
There is such an enmity betwixt it and illegitimate venery, or the uncleanness of the flesh, as that if it do but touch the skin of an adulterer it will break, and that it doth bridle the reins of lasciviousness and much temper it. (Arcula Gemmea. )
Avenzoar held that it was an antidote for poisons, and that six grains of its powder taken in water made an excellent cordial.
Mundella, a sixteenth century physician, calls attention to the purchase of » fine emerald by Franciscus Maria, Prince of Urbine, for use as a remedy in the treatment of a disorder which he was troubled with. (Arcula Gemmea.)
Ahmed Ben Abdalaziz, in his Treatise on Jewels, says that if a serpent fix his eyes on the luster of emeralds he immediately becomes blind. Thus Moore in ‘‘ Lalla Rookh:”
Blinded like serpents when they gaze Upon the emerald’s virgin blaze.
The Shah of Persia has a small casket of gold studded with emeralds, said to have been blessed by Mahomet, which has the property of rendering the royal wearer invisible so long as he remains celibate.
The San Greal was a chalice made from a single emerald, and which possessed the power of preserving chastity, prolonging life, curing wounds and disease, and other wonderful properties. The Holy Grail was used at the Last Supper, and in it were caught the last drops of the blood of Christ as he was taken from the cross. In the legends and poetry of the middle ages are many notices of the Greal. A subject . revived by Tennyson.
The Romans used it to rest, strengthen, and preserve the eyes, a practice which persisted through the Middle Ages, during which period water in which the stone had stood was used as a specific for ophthalmia.

Boetius de Boot gives directions for its treatment for use as a drug as follows:
Pound the emerald in an iron mortar, sift the powder through the muslin, then cover it with spiritus urine; the spirit must be distilled off, leaving the powder of a gray color, but which will communicate that of the emerald to the spirits of wine.
This taken internally was considered a powerful remedy for many diseases such as dysentery, epilepsy, venomous bites, fevers, ete.
According to Sanskrit medicine—
The emerald is cool, good in poisoning, sweet, and purgative, helps digestion, cures biliousness, removes disrelish, is nutritious, and wards off spectral influences. (Tagore, Treatise on Gems. )
The Hindu authorities held that the perfect emerald was an infallible remedy for all cases of poisoning; cleansed men from sin, brought about success in war, and rendered successful the rites performed according to the Atharva-Veda. The defective emerald lead to sickness, injury, loss of male children, and rendered one liable to bites. (Mani-Mala. )
The Persian and Arabian sages taught that, whether worn or taken as a medicine, the emerald— bestows contentment of mind, quickens the pulse, gives nourishment to the soul, heart, brains, and stomach, cures epilepsy, removes all bodily pain, stops the vomit ing and purging of blood, is an antidote to poison, allays unnatural thirst, ana is a panacea for jaundice, liver troubles, stricture, gravel, and leprosy.
If administered in doses weighing 8 wheat corns toa patient suffering from poison, it neutralizes its action, provided it be taken soon enough. To prevent vomiting of blood, the dose of the emerald should be the weight of 4 barleycorns. The powder applied to the eyes, brings out all impurities therein and stops the flow of fluid substances. When set ina gold ring and worn on the forefinger or thumb, it is a prophylactic against cholera. The ashes of burnt emerald heals ulcers if applied locally.
According to the Rosicrucians, if at the time when Sol enters Libra an emerald be set in a gold ring of the same weight and worn on the finger, its wearer would attain his cherished object and could detect the presence of poisons by the sweating of the stone.
The possessor of an emerald would never become poor.
If a serpent looked at this stone, he was struck with blindness.
The Egyptians held that the best test for a genuine emerald was that a serpent immediately fell to licking it as soon as it came across it.
The Aztecs administered its powder as a remedy for venereal diseases.
Garnet.—Kmblematic of constancy. Its virtue was to dispel ‘*‘poisonous and infectious airs” (Leonardus). During the Middle Ages it was considered to possess the same marvelous and medicinal properties as the ruby, though toa less degree. It gave and preserved health, drove away vain thoughts, and reconciled differences between ° friends.

<<<Page: 834>>>

Suspended from the neck, it kept off plague and thunder, strengthened the heart, and increased riches and honors. (Gioy. B. Porta, Magiae Naturalis. 1561.)
According to the Puranas—
A garnet which is colored like the conch, the lotus, the black bee, or the sun, and which is strung on a thread, is sound and auspicious, and heralds good fortune. A garnet which is colored like the crow, the horse, the ass, the jackal, the bull, or the blood-stained beak of a vulture holding a piece of flesh, brings on death.
Jacinth.—Procured sleep, riches, honor, and wisdom. A preservative against pestilence and foes. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.) | . Cardanus, in De Lapidibus preciosis, says that he was in the habit of carrying a jacinth about him for the purpose of inducing sleep, which he says ‘‘it did seem somewhat to confer, but not much.”
Nicols, quoting Cardanus, says that jacinth procured sleep, cheered the heart, drove away plagues, brought protection from thunder, and increased wisdom and honor when worn on the finger or about the neck as an amulet. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
Jade.—Worn as an amulet’ or administered internally, it was a curative of diseases of the kidney and loins.
Wecker, in the Antidote speciale de Lapidibus minus preciosis Alterantibus, says that a nobleman, well known to him, had a fine ‘*nephritick stone,” which he wore on his arm—
by the power of which he voided a very great quantity of gravel, so great as that he feared lest he should suffer harm by so large an expulsion of it in so short a time.
Porta, in the Magiz Naturalis, says:—It alleviates the pain of the kidneys, expels gravels from the bladder, and when worn as a charm is a preservative against venomous things.
Jausper.—Was a charm against scorpions and spiders. (Boot, Gemmarum et Lapidarum Historia. 1690.)

Lodestone.—Orpheus, in the Hymni et de Lapidibus, says:
It will confer strength, banish disease, and when worn constantly about the person ward off epidemics and plagues. Sitting before it and fixing the eyes earnestly upon it one has but to ask the gods for light on any subject, and the answer will come breathing out through the stone. The soul will hear it and the senses discover it clearly.

over a household fire caused the inmates to flee in a panic, an artifice, according to the popular belief, made use of by thieves. (The Mirror of Stones. 1750.)
It is good against the headache, convulsions, and poisons; and that it causeth easy delivery, and procureth love ’twixt man and wife, and preserveth peace and concord amongst friends, and that it driveth away fears and increases wisdom. Galen and Dioscorides say it. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653. )
Lodestone is in repute to-day as a preventive and cure for cramps, colic, and rheumatism. Among the American negroes it is used as a voodoo stone, and is thought to be a love charm; to possess phallic properties; to increase the strength of the body, and to cure lumbago, rheumatism, and hernia. .
Malachite.--Thought to increase the strength and growth of children and ward from them all dangers and infirmities. (Pliny, Nat. Hist.; Solinus, Polyhist., C. 36; Baccius de Nat. gem., C. 29.)
It strengthened the stomach; preserved children from hurt and convulsions. (Arcula Gemmea. ) y
Boetius states that six grains taken internally acts as an excellent purgative. It will cure ‘‘cardialgia” and colic. (Tract. de Lapidibus et Gemmis. )
Held to be a powerful local anzesthetic, for ‘‘ being taken in drink or bruised in vinegar and applied to the members that are to be cut off and burnt, it makes them so insensible that they feel scarce any pain.” (Speculum Lapidum.)
According to Pliny, ‘*the image of the moon contained therein daily waxes or wanes according to the period of the lunar motion.”

The stone was thought to be a powerful aphrodisiac; to increase spittle in children; hasten a birth; give rise to nightmare, and stir up strife. Used as an eyestone ‘‘it enters of its own accord, and if it found anything within that is noxious, it drives it out and tempers the hurtful and contrary humors.” (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
The belief in its causing nightmare and strife was widespread. This belief was explained by Benoni on the assumption that ‘‘in the onyx is a demon imprisoned in the stone who wakes only of a night, causing terror and disturbance to sleepers who wear it.”
Moonstone.
Onyu.

<<<Page: 837>>>

Among the Persians the onyx is to-day administered as a drug for the cure of epilepsy.
Opal.—Symbolical of hope.
The gem was in great repute as an eyestone, and was used in all diseases of the eve. It partook of all the virtues of those stones whose colors it showed. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
It stimulated the heart; preserves from contagious and infectious airs; drives away despondency; prevents fainting, heart disease, and malignant affections. (Giov. B. Porta, Magiae Naturalis. 1561.)
The opal was supposed to indicate the state of health of its wearer by change of color, losing its brilliancy if the wearer was ill, and vice versa.
The idea that the opal is unlucky is based on a teutonic superstition, and is comparatively modern. Mention of its supposed evil qualities is made in a work entitled Art Magic; Mundane, Submundane, and Supermundane Spiritism, in which the opal is credited with being fatal to love and sowing discord between giver and receiver.
Pearl.—Emblematic of purity, beauty, and nobility.
Pliny states that pearls were supposed to be generated by a celestial dew falling on the shellfish, which, in the early mornings of certain seasons, left the bottom of the sea to draw in the air containing the dew from which the pearls were derived, the size and quality of the pearl depending upon the size of the dewdrop and the purity of the air. Cloudy weather spoiled the color, lightning stopped the growth, and thunder ruined the gem.
According to the ancient Hindu authorities, pearls were held to originate in elephants, clouds, boars, conch shells, fishes, frogs, oysters, and bamboos. Of these, the oysters were the most productive. The pearls were formed by rain drops falling into the open shell of the mollusk, the finest gems being found during the period when the sun rested on arcturus, the fifteenth lunar asterism.
In the Orient the pearl was and is extensively used as a medicine for syncope, hemorrhage, stomach troubles, etc. In China large quantities of seed pearls are made into an electuary, and taken to restore manly vigor and as a stimulant.
According to Sanskrit medical science, the pearl is **sweet in taste, very cool, and a specific for eye diseases, cures poisoning and atrophy, and brings strength to weak limbs.” (Mani-Mala.)
The Arabian and Persian sages held that the use of pearls was conducive to contentment of body and soul; cured insanity and all mental diseases; all diseases of the heart, stomach, and bowels; piles, stricture, and excessive and insufficient menstruation. It was an antidote for poison, stopped bleeding from cuts, and cured leprosy and skin diseases.
Rambam recommends the use of the burnt powder as an ointment

<<<Page: 838>>>

in the treatment of ulcers and diseases of the eye, such as conjunctivitis, cataract, etc. The burnt powder taken internally cured yomiting of blood and purging.
According to Egyptian medicine, pearl powder taken with electuaries strengthened the body and added luster to the eyes.
The Hindu authorities recognized four shades as belonging to pearls—yellow, honey, white, and blue. The first brings wealth, the second fosters understanding, the third brings fame, and the fourth good luck. If defective, according to the kind and degree, the pearl brought on leprosy, loss of male issue, loss of fortune, disgrace, slothfulness, insanity, and death. (Mani-Mala.)
According to Art Magic; or Mundane, Submundane, and Supermun-’ dane Spiritism, the wearing of pearls brought one en rapport with spirits and promoted chastity.
In Bengal bracelets of pearl are worn by virgins to preserve their — virtue. .
In Europe as late as the seventeenth century decoctions containing ~ pearls were thought to be powerful mental stimulants and a cure for insanity. A decoction of pearl powder and distilled water was one of the remedies given to the insane Charles, King of Spain.
Leonardus states that pearls boiled in meat would cure the quartan ague; powdered and taken with milk, they healed ulcers and cleared the voice; they comforted the heart, gave relief in cramps and colic, © cured epilepsy and dysentery; taken with sugar, they were of assistance in the cure of pestilential fevers, and that they rendered their wearers virtuous.
According to Nicols (Arcula Gemmea), pearls were— good against syncopes, and cardiacall passions, that they do comfort the spirits, stop the fluxes of bloud, cure lienteries and diarrheas, and that they are good for the sight.
Prase.—Suapposed to possess all the properties of the emerald, but to a less degree. Lost its color on contact with poison or venom, but recovered it again on being washed. Reported to be an excellent cordial and cardiac stimulant. Applied to the eyes, it strengthened the sight. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
Benoni states that the powder mixed with the milk of a ewe that has had but one lamb will, if applied locally, cure the gout; taken internally, it was a deadly poison.
Quartz. ‘ powder mixed with wine was given for dysentery in the north of England during the twelfth century. A crystal held against the tongue assuaged cnt st. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. ).
Applied locally today in the mountains of ee for faintness, headaches, and bleeding at the nose. Used in parts of Virginia to cure styes; the sty is rubbed with the crystal three times a day for three days. In northern New York a so-called ‘vital ore,” consisting

<<<Page: 839>>>

entirely of quartz sand, is sold as a veritable panacea, curing sore
eyes, piles, carbuncles, indigestion, sore throat, giddiness, and blood-
poisoning.
In the Middle Ages the clear, transparent quartz was believed to betray the presence of poison, either by becoming opaque or breaking. The powder, mixed with wine, was given in dysentery; held in the mouth, it assuaged thirst, cured headaches and faintness; powdered and taken with wine and honey, it filled the breasts of nursing women with milk. (Leonardus.)
Orpheus recommended its use as a medicine for diseases of the kidneys.
Andrea Bacci, writing in 1605, says:
It is used either in powder, or the salt of it, or the oil of it, against all obstructions of the bowels, against gouts, swoonings, and all cephalic diseases.
A drachm of the powder taken with oil of sweet almonds cures those that have taken sublimate. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
Quartz balls were and are used by mystics, astrologers, and diviners to foretell the future, review the past, and conjure up distant scenes. The famous **show-stone” of Dr. Dee, a sphere three inches in diameter, was made of quartz. It is interesting to note that while the modern mystic and the mystic of the Middle Ages differ somewhat in their methods, each have the same end in view, and each have produced witnesses to show that they attained that end. The methods used to induce a vision as practiced by the mystic of the Middle Ages are as follows: The crystal, according to Scot, in his ** Discovery of Witchcraft,” when ** charged” with the name of St. Helen written on the stone with olive oil while the operator faced the east, and held in the hands of an innocent child born in wedlock, would, upon the recital of a prayer to the saint, become an oracle and answer any question put to it. j
In an eighteenth century manuscript is the following statement—
Take a christall stone or glasse, most clear, without a craise, and wrape about it a pece of harte’s lether, saying, ‘‘In the name of the Holy Trinity, and of the hey Deity Amen.’’ Then holde the cristalle in the beam where the @} is most bright, at the hottest of the day, and say there con (jurations) subscribed, and by and by you shall sie the spirit peradventer, appeiring himselfe.
The spirit is then to be ‘** charged,” upon which he will point out the whereabouts of stolen property; the location of buried treasure; give information concerning relatives, friends, or enemies, or such other information as may be desired.
According to Hindu authorities the quartz is— cool and cooling, cures hemorrhage from the nose and mouth,and when worn removes baneful astral influences.
The crystal gives strength and cures biliousness, morbid heat, and fistula. A specific for consumption, leprosy, and poisoning. It may enter into medicines as a substitute for diamonds. (Mani-Miéli. ) :

<<<Page: 840>>>

A good rock erystal is an infallible remedy in all cases of poisoning. Wild animals like the leopard, the elephant, the lion, and the tiger, can not approach this gem. It neutralizes snake, rat, and scorpion poisons, and the wearer need never fear drowning, fire, ora thief. A moss-colored, clouded, rough, yellow, dull, dirty, and discolored rock crystal the authorities shun from a distance. (Tagore, a Treatise on Gems. )
Ruby.—Emblematic of love.
A sovereign remedy and amulet against plague, poison, evil thoughts, nightmare, and diverted the mind from sadness and sensuality. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum.
It forewarned the wearer of the approach of any misfortune by loss of color. In this connection Wolfgang Gabelchover gives his experience:
On December 5, 1600, as I was travelling from Studtgard in company with my beloved wife, Catherine Adelmann, of pious memory, I observed most distinctly during the journey that a very fine ruby, her gift, which I wore set in a ring upon my finger, had lost almost all its splendid color, and had put on dullness in place of brilliancy and darkness in place of light; which blackness and opacity lasted not for one or two days only, but for several. * * * Whereupon I warned my wife that some grievous mishap was impending over either her or myself, as I foreboded from the change of color in my ruby. Nor was I wrong in my anticipation, inasmuch as within a few days she was taken with a fatal sickness that never left her till the day of her death. And truly, after her decease, its former brilliant color returned spontaneously to my ruby.
Arabian and Persian writers taught that the wearer of the ruby obtained peace of mind and strength of brain.
A durm dose of it, taken internally, cures epilepsy, insanity, cholera, and the spitting of blood; causes free circulation of blood throughout the system, and prevents uneasiness of mind. It cures all kinds of poisonings from snake bite or from administration of poison by enemies. It frees the atmosphere from the pollution engendered by cholera. It purifies the blood and brings back to its normal state the fatally quick action of the pulse. The wearer of th» ruby in the form of a finger ring obtains from the deity all the desires of his heart and becomes proof against thunder stroke and cholera. Worn over the eyes or applied to them as an ointment it cures all complaints of the vision; over the mouth it takes away the bad smell of ic, allays thirst, and gives constant satisfaction to the mind. It brings honor to the wearer. The dose for internal use is from 1 kirat (4 barleycorns) to 1 dang (16 barleycorns). (See the work Karabadin Kabir, as cited by Tagore in his Treatise on Gems. )
The ruby enters into the Chinese pharmacopceia as an ingredient in the ‘five precious fragments,” supposed to consist of ruby, topaz, emerald, sapphire, and hyacinth.
The Hindu writers held that those rubies—
which are flawless and of approved color are auspicious, produce health, wealth, wisdom, and happiness. If flawed or offcolored they bring humiliation, loss of — friends, liability to wounds, loss of wealth, and lightning stroke; are fatal to domestic animals, and are inimical to life, wealth, and fame.
The man who treasures a ruby furnished with every perfection, and which when cast in a quantity of milk a hundred times its bulk, makes the white mass one entire

<<<Page: 841>>>

sheet of red, or sends out a red flame, is as meritorious as the celebration of the Aswamedha jajna.' Such a stone leads to wealth, success, happiness, and long life. (Mani-Mala.)
Sapphire.—Emblematic of wisdom. If placed on the heart it bestows strengthandenergy. St. Jerome states that the sapphire procures royal _ favors, softens anger, frees people from enchantment, obtains release from captivity, and prevents evil and impure thoughts.
Because of its extreme coldness it was thought to preserve the chastity of its wearer, hence especially suited for ecclesiastical rings.
Worn in a ring or in any other manner it is able to quench concupiscence, and for this reason it is proper to be worn by the priesthood and by all persons vowed to perpetual chastity. It is said to grow dull if worn by an adulterous or lascivious person.
It rendered its wearer chaste, virtuous, pious, devout, wise, amiable, and pacific. It cured boils, carbuncles, and headaches, rested and refreshed the body, and gave a color to the cheeks. Taken with milk it cured cramps. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.)
Soaked in vinegar its vinegar extract was administered in fevers; powdered and soaked in vinegar for one phase of the moon, it was given to insure continency and conjugal love. (Galen.)
Placed on the heart it cured fever; on the forehead it stopped bleeding at the nose. The powder taken with milk was a remedy for fevers, plague, and poison. (Albertus Magnus.)
The powdered sapphire used as an ointment cured inflammation and irritation-of the eyes; it was also thought to be able to draw out any foreign substance that might be present in them. (Canones Medicine.)
According to Gioy. Porta the sapphire was of great service in necromancy and the magic arts, and a deadly enemy to all venomous reptiles and insects. (Magiae Naturalis. 1561.)
The Hindus regarded the stone as unlucky and as a bringer of misfortune. Thus—
A sapphire, the surface of which wears a mica-like sheen, * * * brings about loss of wealth and life. That mark in a sapphire which at first sight looks like a rift, * * * renders one liable to bites. That sapphire which is parti-colored causes loss of family dignity. The sapphire which contains dirt produces a variety of skin diseases like itching. That which contains gritty fragments is destructive; that which is rough causes banishment. (Mani-M4la.) ;
The same authority says, however, ‘‘that sapphire which when placed in a pot of milk darkens it all through, increases wealth, and is conducive to fame and increase of family,” while ‘‘a flawless, sterling sapphire brings its wearer strength, fame, and length of days,” and **the man who wears a sapphire of spotless chastity finds favor with Narayana,’ and acquires longevity, family dignity, fame, understanding, and wealth.”
the antiquity of which dates back to
'The Horse Sacrifice, a celebrated ceremony, the Vedic period. * The preserver of the Hindu Triad.

According to the Sanskrit medical science the sapphire is bitter, warm, and good in cold and biliousness, and when worn alleviates the rage of Sani.’ -
In Egypt the sapphire is taken with majoom (electuaries) to add strength to the body. (Tagore, Treatise on Gems.)
The Buddhists esteem the sapphire above all gems, claiming that it
produced tranquillity of mind, and when worn by one wholly pure and a
devoted to God insures protection against disease, danger, and venomous reptiles.
The saphire is of a cold and drie faculty, even as are most pretious stones; it is reported of it that it is good against feverish distempers, hence this old distick.
Corporis ardorem refrigerat interiorem Sapphirus, & cyprize languida vota facit.
The best of these are very comfortable to the eyes if they be often looked on. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
It is reported of it that if it be worn by an adulterer, by loosing its splendor it will discover his adultery.. (Cardanus, De Lapidibus preciosis. )
The sapphire is of so contrary a nature to poisons that if placed in a glass with a spider the insect will quickly die. (Arcula Gemmea. 1653.)
St. Jerome wrote that the sapphire conciliates to its wearer the condescension of princes, quells his enemies, disperses sorcery, sets free the captive, and may even assuage the wrath of God.
In the inventory of the jewels of Charles V, mention is made of a ‘bluestone with two clasps of gold, good for the gout.”
In the church of Old St. Paul’s, London, was a famous sapphire which was supposed to cure the infirmities of the eyes of all those thus afflicted who might resort to it.
The modern mystic holds it capable of attracting powerful planetary influences, and nearly equal to the diamond and quartz in inducing visions. (Art Magic; or Mundane, Submundane, and Supermundane Spiritism.)
The star sapphire was and is still reputed to be a potent love charm. The powder of this gem was taken as an aphrodisiac during the Middle Ages. Star sapphire as a powder was given for vertigo in the low countries as late as 1810.
Sard.—Said to possess sex.
The males shine brighter than the females; for the females are the fattest and glitter more obscurely. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum.)
The sard nullified the evil effects of the onyx when worn with it; sharpened the wit; gave cheerfulness, and prevented dysentery. (Albertus Magnus, Leonardus, and De Boot.)
Epiphanius, writing in 1565, says that the sard conferredeupon its wearer a cheerful heart, courage, and presence, and protected him from witchcraft and noxious humors.
‘One of the stars influencing the destinies of men.

<<<Page: 843>>>

a eel
Baccius in his Annotations says that powdered sard taken in spirits stops the menses and prevents miscarriage.
Sardonyx.—Symbolical of conjugal bliss. It rendered its possessor virtuous, cheerful, and agreeable. (Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum. 1502.) -
Spinel.—Reconciled differences between friends; gave health and strength to the body; cured disorders of the liver; restrained passion and fiery wrath; and wasa preservative from lightning. (Leonardus.)
Powdered and taken with water Arnobis used it as a remedy for diseases of the eye. (Dissertatio Medica.)
Boetius held that the wearing of a balas ruby (spinel) restrained fury, wrath, and lust.
In the Arcula Gemmea, written in 1653, the author, Nicols, says:
Rulandus reporteth this of it. That if the four corners of a house, arbor, or vineyard be covered with this stone it will preserve it from lightning, tempests, and worms.
According to Arabian and Persian medicine, the wearing of the spinel gives contentment, prevents the spitting of blood, cures piles, and all diseases caused by the increase of phlegm. The dose for internal use is from 1 svrat (4 barleycorns) to 1 dang (16 barleycorns). Applied as an ointment to the eyes the stone adds to their luster.
According to an Arabic work, entitled Azaabul beldan, as cited by Tagore:
The sea cows get spinel stones from the Kokaf Mountains and put them on the ground when they come grazing toward Ceylon. The stone gatherers, who remain concealed all about, then come out in stealthy steps, carefully throw lumps of clay over the stones left, and then retire. When after grazing these animals go back to the sea, disappointed at not finding the stones and fretting and fuming with rage, those people came back and took away the precious stones.
Staurolite.—In Brittany, France, a superstitious reverence is attached to the cruciform crystals of this stone, based on a belief that they fell from heaven.
In Virginia and the Carolinas the staurolite, locally known as fairy stone, is worn as a lucky charm and is believed to bring good fortune and ward off danger and disease.
Sunstone.— According to Sanskrit authorities—
the sunstone is warm, flawless, and good in cold and defective oxidation, and sacred; it is an elixir vite, and is the delight of the Sun. (Mani-M4li.)
Topaz.—Symbolical of friendship.
It cooled boiling water on being immersed in it; became opaque on contact with poisons; restrained anger and desire; cured insanity; checked the flow of blood; cleansed hemorrhoids, and averted sudden death. (Camillus Leonardus, Speculum Lapidum.)
Benoni states that the topaz is favorable for all hemorrhages, and imparts strength and good digestion. Powdered and taken in wine it cured asthma and insomnia. (Dissertatio Medica.)

<<<Page: 844>>>

Rubbea on a hone the topaz gave a milky juice in quantities, and yet lost none of its original weight. The juice was taken internally in cases of dropsy, and certain poisonings. Used as an ointment it was in repute as a curative for diseases of the eye. (Epiphanius.)
Worn as an amulet, so says Porta, it drove away sadness and nightmare; strengthened the intellect and bestowed courage. Mounted in gold and’hung around the neck it dispelled enchantments; worn on the left hand it preserved its wearer from sensuality.
In the Honest Jeweller, written in the seventeenth century, the statement is made that— the virtue and strength of the topaz is said to increase and decrease with the moon, and consist in the fact that when thrown into boiling water, it at once deprives it of its heat. =
According to the Sanskrit authorities, the— topaz is sour, cool, and curative of abnormal oxidation, gives an appetite, and brings fame and wisdom.
The Hindu sages held that the medicinal properties of the topaz were similar to those of the coral, and in addition it prevented and cured sterility. (Mani-Mala.)
Like the ruby, the topaz was supposed to possess the power of emitting light to a great degree. A topaz given by the wife of Theoderic, count of Holland, to Adelbert, gave out so brilliant a light in the chapel where it was kept that prayers could be read by it.
Turquoise.—Emblematic of success. Highly valued by all orientals and worn by them to insure health and success. Supposed to preserve the wearer from injury through accidents. In the presence of poisonsthe stone sweated profusely, a property thought to be characteristic of many of the noble gems. Its color paled as its owner sickened and was lost entirely on his death, to be recovered only on its becoming the property of a healthy person.
The turquoise, according to Arabian and Persian authorities, as cited in the Mani-Malé, cured all diseases of the head and heart. A sovereign remedy for hernia, swellings, flatulence, dyspepsia, insanity, and cancerous sores. Whether taken alone, mixed with honey or with other drugs, it cures epilepsy, spleen, and stricture. In cases of poisoning or snake bite, it was given with wine. Aristotle advises a similar ‘dose for the same purpose. Applied as an ointment to the eyes, it increased their luster, restored the vision, and prevented the fall of fluids therefrom. Worn as an amulet, the turquoise brought happiness, dispelled fear, and rendered its wearer safe from drowning, lightning stroke, and snake bite. Seen after looking at the moon on the first day after the new moon, it brought good luck.
In Egypt cure of a cataract is believed to be effected by the local application of a turquoise set in a silver ring and dipped in water,

<<<Page: 845>>>

the application being accompanied by the chanting of the name of God.
Variolite.—Supposed to be a preventive and cure for variola (smallpox). (Castellani, History of Gems. )
Water sapphire or tolite.—A woman possessing a ring set with this
stone as a signet and on which was cut one-half of a fish, a mirror, a branch, and a nude female, procured any desire.
Zircon.—Supposed to bring riches, honor, and wisdom; a charm against plague and evil spirits; and afforded its wearer protection against thunderbolts. (Europe During the Middle Ages.).
According to the Mani-Mala
The wearing of a weighty, lustrous, white, cool, tender, very old, and transparent gomeda (zircon) leads to prosperity. <A light, discolored, exceedingly rough, delusion creating, and cool, yet dirty, gomeda blights happiness and saps the foundations of energy.
The same treatise, speaking of its medicinal value, says:
The zircon is sour, heating, and curative of unhealthy oxidation, sharpens the appetite, helps digestion, and takes away sin.
In conclusion, it would be expected to find the belief in the marvelous and medicinal properties of gems prevalent during the age of faith, while during the age of reason and inquiry it seems somewhat childish that they should still continue to exist. In India, the land of occultism, the mystics still pursue their researches after the occult virtues of precious stones. The modern Western spiritualist endeavors to discover and apply the occult knowledge of the East. He still believes in and teaches the virtues of gems, and is emphatic in his opinion that certain gems facilitate the rapport of a certain class of spirits with the wearers of those gems.
Swedenborg, the Swedish mystic, in his spirit revelations to L. A. Cahagnet, as cited in his Magic Magnetique (Paris, 1838), gives numerous categorical answers to questions asked by the medium concerning the spiritual and material powers of certain precious stones.
In Paris a school has been established which has for its object the study of the magnetic emanations, radiance, and crystals. In Nice a Dr. de Lignieres has issued a prospectus of a work of 644 pages that seriously considers the medicinal properties and virtues of precious stones.
ix CATALOGUE OF THE ISAAC LEA COLLECTION OF GEMS.
The exhibit of gems made by the United States National Museum at the New Orleans and Cincinnati expositions in 1884 and 1885 marked the beginning of what is now one of the most complete public collections of gems in the United States. From 1886 to 1890 the growth

<<<Page: 846>>>

of the collection, through gift or purchase, was steady, though slow. In 1891 the museum purchased, for exhibition at the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, the greater part of a collection of gems belonging to the estate of Dr. Joseph Leidy, of Philadelphia, and which was incorporated with the museum collections proper at the close of the exposition. In 1894 it became the possessor, under the provisions of the will of Mrs. Francis Lea Chamberlain, of a valuable collection of 1,316 gems formerly belonging to her father, Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia. This collection, known as the ** Isaac Lea Collection of Gems,” has, since that time, been steadily increased by contributions from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain. A notable accession of gems and gem minerals, chiefly from the United States, was received from Dr. Chamberlain in 1896. This, added to the original ‘‘ Lea Collection,” made it so large that it was decided to incorporate with it all of the gem material belonging to the museum, distinguishing those specimens obtained by gift or deposit, other than the Lea material, by a special label. In 1897 Dr. Chamberlain was appointed honorary custodian of the collection, and largely through his efforts the collection now contains a fine series of gems native to the United States, including nearly every variety and representing the majority of the gem localities. :
In the catalogue is given the name, locality, description, and catalogue numbers of each specimen, and, when donated or deposited, _the name of the parties from whom it was received. As all the stones were weighed in grams, the weights are given in carats and decimals of carats, instead of the more cumbersome fractions. The carat is equal to 0.205 gram; its fractions are known as fourths, eighths, sixteenths, thirty-seconds, and sixty-fourths.

The following catalogue has been prepared by Mr. Tassin mainly to facilitate exchanges and to aid in the building up of the collection, as was a former issue compiled by Prof. F. W. Clarke and printed in the Annual Report of the National Museum for 1885-86 (1889).
For purposes of ready reference, however, the alphabetical arrangement adopted by Wulfing is adhered to. For the same reason the samples belonging to the Shepard collection are included with those of the Museum proper, but always with the proper reference. Where a meteorite is represented in both collections, that belonging to the Museum is first mentioned.
As will be noted, the combined collections now represent 348 falls and finds, of which 148 are irons.
