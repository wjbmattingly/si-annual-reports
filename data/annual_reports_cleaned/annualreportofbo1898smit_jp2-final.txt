Acting Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the U. S. National Museum.
In the introduction to the Report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, attention was called to a new plan of organization, which went _ into effect July 1, 1897, and the statement was made that the results of its operations would be considered in the Report for 1898.
The various divisions and sections of Anthropology, Biology, and Geology, which had previously been conducted independently of one another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum, were united under three head curators, one of anthropology, another of biology, and a third of geology. This secured direct expert supervision and properly correlated the work of each Gepartment. Before, such correlation had been impossible, owing to the large number of independent heads of sections and divisions in each department, who planned and executed the work more or less independently of one another. The official correspondence was also more closely centralized in the executive office of the Museum.
Anthropology.—In the Department of Anthropology a large amount of work was done by Mr. W. H. Holmes in reorganizing and installing the exhibits, under a general scheme approved early in the year. The organization of the department, the personnel, and the details of the work will be found in his report. There are a number of sections that have not yet been assigned to any division, remaining for the present under the direct supervision of the head curator. Moreover, the classification of material and the division of work among the various mem-
bers of the present staff, so far as it has progressed, is largely tentative, owing to the staff being composed of specialists in limited portions of the field of anthropology; this necessitates a somewhat arbitrary
' The organization of the staff is given in Appendix I. 3

<<<Page: 29>>>

classification and organization. As the various branches of the work develop, and increase is made in the number of curators, reclassification of material and readjustment of the force will gradually lead to a satisfactory and permanent organization.
The accessions to the department were numerous and valuable. Among those of more notable importance is a collection of antiquities and ethnological material, the bequest of the late Mr. W. Hallett Phillips, of Washington, to the Smithsonian Institution. This collection is not only of great extent, but of exceptional value to archzological science. It contains 12,467 ancient relics, mainly stone implements from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnological specimens from Polynesia. By transfer from the Bureau of American Ethnology the Museum received material from Arizona, Arkansas, and Georgia; and by transfer from the Army Medical Museum, a collection of 2,206 human crania, representing mainly the Indian tribes, ancient and modern, of North America. There was received on deposit, and at the same time offered for sale, an extensive collection of stone implements and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, together with a collection of ethnological material from the Indians of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, made by Emile Granier, of Paris. Valuable deposits were made by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. These include a large number of pieces of apparatus made and used by him in his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical science. The General Electric Company also deposited many pieces of original apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for lighting, the transmission of power, and like purposes. Other valuable deposits are described in the report of the head curator.
During the year there were prepared by the curators and expert preparators of the department a number of models illustrating primitive life, processes, implements, utensils, ete.
The research work of the department during the year was extensive, the study, comparison, and classification of the collections before installation being essential to their intelligent utilization.
The system of installation inaugurated by Mr. Holmes is somewhat elaborate. The primary arrangement is founded, first, on the geographical or ethnographical assemblage, and, second, on the developmental or genetic assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special. They are the chronological, the comparative, the individual, ete. The primary methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths of anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited portions of the field. A full description of the method of installation will be found in Mr. Holmes’s report.
Biology.—The Department of Biology was embarrassed by reason of Dr. True’s time being largely consumed in executive work, and it was not until late in the year that he secured an assistant curator to take charge of the work in the Division of Mammals.

<<<Page: 30>>>

In many ways the Department of Biology, when established at the beginning of the fiscal year, was in much better condition than either of the other two departments. The several zoological divisions already existing and the Division of Plants were brought together under a separate administrative head. As many of these divisions have been in existence since the reorganization of the Museum in 1881, and several of them for a much longer period, the organization of the department was a relatively simple matter. The biological specimens constitute the larger part of the Museum collections. They had been in charge of curators and assistants who followed the well-defined and long-established methods of systematic zoology and botany, and therefore no radical changes in the scientific methods or in the business administration of these divisions were required. The efforts of the head curator were largely in the direction of developing those features which, from various cases, had not had due prominence. He found the same difficulties met with by the other head curators in regard to laboratory and exhibition space and the force at hiscommand. A large amount of the biological material is displayed in the Smithsonian building. The bringing together of all the invertebrates in this building was accomplished during the year, and this is a great gain in the classification of the exhibits. These collections include insects, mollusks, and all other classes of invertebrates. The display in Musuem building includes the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, fishes, and the collections representing comparative anatomy. The birds remain in the Smithsonian building, it having been found impracticable to transfer this large exhibit to the Museum building.
The erection of galleries in the Museum building—a subject adverted to later—while not involving great changes in this department, as in the departments of Anthropology and Geology, rendered necessary the complete reinstallation of the large exhibition series of mammals. In the reinstallation Dr. True arranged the zoological exhibition on a faunal basis, special prominence being given to the faunas of the United States. This principal series is to be supplemented by various smaller series illustrating important topics in biology.
The additions to the zoological and botanical collections were numerous, and in some directions unusually important. The generous donation of Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz of their collection of Coleoptera, principally North American, comprising about 200,000 specimens and representing approximately 12,000 species, is of great importance, as it places the National Museum in advance of all others as regards North American Coleoptera. Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his liberal gifts to the Museum by presenting large collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and other animals from lower Siam and Kashmir; and Dr. W. L. Ralph supplemented his valuable additions to the collections of birds’ eggs. The largest acquisition to the mollusks consisted in the gift by Dr. R. Ellsworth Call of a collection including over 86,000 Specimens.

<<<Page: 31>>>

Great activity prevailed during the year in the Division of Plants. Accessions to the number of 307 were made, including the purchase of all of the most valuable sets of American plants offered for sale that were needed to fill out the Government collections. This division is more fortunate than others in the Museum, having funds from which such purchases can be made.
The scientific bureaus of the Government, including the Fish Commission and the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, continued to make very valuable additions to the national biological collections. A full description of these, and also of numerous additions from individuals, is given in the report of the head curator of the department, where also will be found the changes in the personnel and an account of the work for the year.
Geology.—In the Department of Geology Dr. Merrill gave a large portion of his time during the year to studying various Huropean museums for the purpose of obtaining information as to the best cases and methods of installation of collections in museums. In addition to the head curator’s absence, nearly all work was suspended in the exhibition halls during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases, so that little progress was made in the exhibition series during the first half of the year. Dr. Merrill resumed active charge of the department early in November, when he began a systematic examination of the written and printed records of the various exploring expeditions and surveys, with a view to ascertaining what geological material had been collected which could properly be considered the property of the Government, and what disposition had been made of the same. The law provides that collections made for the Government shall, when no longer needed for investigations in progress, be deposited in the National Museum.' It was found that this law had not in all cases been enforced, with the result that several important collections had not been transferred to the Museum, although several of the earlier exploring expeditions had passed out of existence, and in several instances the individuals making the collections had likewise passed away. lt was decided to investigate all such cases. A fine collection of fossil fishes, made by the Hayden Survey, was obtained from the executors of Professor Cope’s estate, and some other material is soon to be transferred by them. A request was made to the Geological Survey for any material that could be transferred without detriment to investigations in progress, assurance being given that the Museum could take charge of extensive collections. The Survey soon transferred a large
'“And all collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the
National Museum.” (Supplement to the Revised Statutes of the United States, Vol. I, second edition, 1874-1891, page 252.)

<<<Page: 32>>>

amount of good material, including in one instance two carloads of vertebrate fossils from the laboratories of Prof. O. C. Marsh, in New Haven, Connecticut.
The collection of fossil invertebrates was greatly enriched by two most important gifts. Through the bequest of the late I. H. Harris, of Ohio, the Museum came into possession of his private collection of over 20,000 specimens of fossils; this is particularly rich in many rare forms and a number of original types. From Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum was already so largely indebted, there was received a large collection of fossil insects, comprising upward of 4,600 specimens, of which more than 200 are types. Other valuable accessions are mentioned in the report of the head curator.
In the Division of Mineralogy satisfactory progress was made in the installation of the exhibition series. An immense amount of detail work in overhauling and classifying collections stored in boxes and drawers was accomplished. Owing to the pressure of other matters and the unsatisfactory condition of the exhibition halls, scarcely any investigations of note were undertaken by the curators.
The erection of the galleries in three of the halls and the four courts of the Museum building, under the acts of Congress approved June 11, 1896, and June 4, 1897, was completed during the year, with the exception of the permanent railings. This increased the available floor space of the Museum 17,000 square feet, or about one-sixth of the former exhibition space. The various wall exhibits that formerly extended to a greater height than the base of the galleries were removed early in the year, and after the galleries were completed many cases containing exhibits were placed on them. In addition to the galleries already completed, it was decided to construct other galleries affording a further floor space of 6,468 square feet, mainly for the purpose of securing more room for the library and for the preparation of exhibits.
During the fiscal year there were 1,441 accessions, containing upward of 450,000 specimens, the largest number for any one year during the past decade. The total number of specimens recorded to July 1, 1898, exceeds 4,000,000,
Owing probably to the national disturbance and distraction caused by the war, the attendance was less than during the previous year, when the multitude attending the Presidential inauguration ran the record unusually high. The following table shows that the number of Visitors to the Museum since 1881 is 3,972,987.

The administrative work of the Museum was conducted most efficiently during the year, mainly by Dr. I’. W. True, as executive curator, and for short intervals by Dr. G. P. Merrill and Mr. W. H. Holmes, respectively. Mr.J.L. Willige was acting chief clerk during the absence of Mr. Cox in connection with the Nashville and Omaha expositions. As chief of buildings and superintendence, Mr. J. KE. Watkins took charge of the erection of the new galleries, and much of the success attending their construction is due to his careful supervision.
In conclusion, it is a pleasure to me to state that commendation is due the head curators and their assistants for the energy and patience they have shown and for their willingness to subordinate individual desires and preferences to the general welfare of the work of the Museum. It is owing to this esprit de corps that the work of the Museum progressed so satisfactorily during the year.
A national museum should be the center of scientific activity in the country in which it is located. In England the British Museum is the mecca of scientific men. The national museums in Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna, Berlin, and other capitals of Europe stand in similar relations to the scientific work of their respective countries. Sucha relation the National Museum should hold to scientific men and affairs in America. It should receive and take care of all classes of material which have been or may be valuable for investigation or for the illustration of the ethnology, natural history, geology, products, and resources of our own country or for comparison with those of other countries. It should furnish material for all kinds of scientific investigations which deal with specimens or types, and give aid to such researches and publish their results. It should present by illustration such of the results of the scientific investigations of its corps of officers as are susceptible of such representation. It should cooperate with all of the higher educational institutions of learning in the country, and assist in the promotion and diffusion of knowledge in all of the lines of investigation which are carried on by them. It should provide library facilities, and, as far as can be done with justice to itself, aid all postgraduate students who may wish to take advantage of the generous provisions made by the Government for scientific investigations.

<<<Page: 34>>>

The growth of the U.S. National Museum was rapid under the suecessful charge of the late Dr.G. Brown Goode. When the character of the building and the funds available for its maintenance are considered, it compares favorably with any modern museum. It has received large collections from the scientific departments of the Government, and through private contribution (with some additions by purchase and exchange), all of which have been accommodated as well as could be in the inadequate laboratories, storerooms, and exhibition space. The galleries just completed have added 16,000 square feet of floor space, which will help to a certain extent to relieve the crowded condition of the exhibition halls and courts below. As an illustration of the present conditions and the necessity for more room, attention is called to the anthropological collections, which illustrate the development and progress of man and his works. If the material now in the possession of the Government in this department should be properly placed on exhibition, it would occupy the entire space in the present Museum building. The great collections in zoology, botany, economic geology, general geology, and paleontology should be entirely removed and placed in a building properly constructed for their study and exhibition.
Laboratory space.—In the present building there is a great deficiency in laboratory facilities. Curators and assistants are hampered for want of room in which to lay out, arrange, classify, mount, and label specimens. There should also be rooms in which students could bring together and compare various series of objects, and have at hand books and scientific apparatus. The present Museum building contains a few rooms suitable for the purposes mentioned, but the majority have to be used as storerooms, laboratories, and offices, and are therefore too much crowded to serve in any one of these capacities. Owing to the pressure for space, courts, halls, and galleries intended for exhibition purposes, both in the Smithsonian building and in the Museum building, are unavoidably occupied to a considerable extent as laboratories and storerooms. This lack of laboratory space is extremely detrimental to the interests of the Museum.
Quarters for storage.—Beyond six small basement rooms under two of the corner pavilions the present building has absolutely no provision in the way of basement or other rooms for the storage of collections which come in from day to day from Government field collectors or private donors, or such as are separated for distribution or held for the use of students. To remedy this defect many expedients have necessarily been resorted to, such as placing storage cases (faced with mahogany to make them presentable) in the exhibition halls, hiring storage rooms in private buildings, and filling up offices, entrances, Staircase-landings, and passageways not absolutely indispensable. The ingenuity which has been exercised in this direction by some of the curators is very great and the annoyances that are daily endured in the interest of preserving the collections deserve notice. What is

<<<Page: 35>>>

needed is a series of spacious fireproof, basements for the less perishable objects, the collections preserved in alcohol, and the ordinary stores and tools, and equally spacious dry lofts and rooms for those collections and stores which require protection from dampness.
Exhibition space.—The present Museum building, though large in extent, is overcrowded. It was built with the cheapest materials and under the cheapest system of construction. Its lack of architectural dignity and the indifferent character of the materials of which it is constructed give it the appearance of a temporary structure and tend to cheapen the effect of the really good cases and the very valuable collections which it contains. The visitor is everywhere confronted with rough walls, unfinished ceilings, and obtrusive trusses and supports. It should also be remembered that a considerable portion of the collections are still in the Smithsonian building, where the crowding is scarcely less than in the Museum building.
The head curators, curators, assistant curators, and aids, constituting the scientific staff of the National Museum, number in all 63 persons, divided among sixteen divisions. Of these, 26 are compensated for their services and the remainder serve gratuitously, being for the most part connected with other bureaus of the Government. The system of honorary curatorship, while admirable within restricted limits, is a disadvantage when carried to the present extent. Such a system has a disintegrating effect upon the organization, as the men are not entirely at the command of the administrative officers and are not obliged to serve at definite hours or under the ordinary restrictions of the paid curators. The number of honorary officers should be reduced by the substitution of a larger number of salaried officers.
The total number of scientific assistants should be very considerably increased, as nearly all of the divisions are short-handed and many of the collections do not receive the care they should have. At present there are not enough assistants who can serve as acting officers in a higher grade when the regular occupants of those offices are ill or necessarily detailed for service outside of Washington. Moreover, a museum can not be successfully carried on with intermittent service, and it is extremely desirable that there should always be a considerable number of young men learning the duties of scientific assistants, and thus making themselves capable of taking the places of the older men when the latter become incapacitated. There are now only four or five such young men in the Museum service.
The National Museum has at present no regular fund for the acquisition of collections and special objects, and can only make purchases from a contingent fund which rarely exceeds $3,000 or $4,000, and which is likely at any time to be required for other necessary expenditures. For this reason, every year valuable collections which should be in the

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. at
hands of the Government, go abroad or to municipal museums or pass into the hands of private citizens. Money is also needed to fill out and make significant the various series already established in the Museum. The American Museum of Natural History in New York expends annually $60,000 for the increase of its collections, and the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago has spent for collections during the last five years over $419,000. Much of this was expended the first year, but material is purchased from time to time as it is needed to _make collections more nearly complete.
No effort on any scale commensurate with the importance of the Museum has hitherto been possible in the direction of acquiring collections by field work and exploration. There are many kinds of collections that can be obtained only by scientific men working in the field. Collecting expeditions are often costly, but in many cases their results are such as can be obtained in no other way. There is no doubt whatever that it would be a very great advantage to the National Museum if it could every year, besides purchasing a reasonable amount of material, send out collectors to various regions to obtain objects which are never offered for sale, and which, if gathered by unskilled collectors, would lose all their value.
The experience of many years has shown that however active surveying and exploring expeditions may be, collections can not thus be made to grow symmetrically. There are always gaps which can be filled only by purchase of materials. It is often necessary, for purposes of comparision and for study, that the Museum obtain collections from abroad, and such as can be had also only by purchase or exchange. This fact is well recognized abroad, and the British museums and some of those on the Continent contain rarer and better specimens from America than do the American museums.
It is well known that the Museum distributes great quantities of duplicate specimens. This is a very important work and could be much extended if the scientific staff were larger. The work of bringing together, identifying, labeling, and preparing for shipment sets of specimens for educational institutions is very considerable, and consumes so much time that it can not be properly entered upon by the present
force. A NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.
The immediate and greatest need is a suitable museum building. The present building is 375 feet square. The space on the ground floor is 140,625 square feet, and that in the galleries 16,000 square feet; exhibition space 96,000 square feet. The entire cost was $315,400.
For comparison with the above figures the following statistics relating to the American Museum of Natural History in New York are given. Total floor space, 294,000 square feet, divided as follows: Exhibition space, 196,000 square feet; laboratories, library, ete., 42,500

<<<Page: 37>>>

square feet; work rooms, storage, etc., 42,000 square feet; lecture hall, 13,500 square feet. These figures include the portions of the building now being completed. The total cost of the museum to date, including the completion of the new wings, is $3,559,470.15. The buildings and the care of them are provided for by the city of New York. The expenses of the scientific staff, increase of collections, etc. (the income for which the present year is approximately $185,000), are defrayed from endowments, membership fees, and contributions.
The present National Museum building was erected with the view of covering the largest amount of space with the least outlay of money. In this respect it may be considered a success. It is, in fact, scarcely more than the shadow of such a massive, dignified, and well-finished building as should be the home of the great national collections. There is needed at once a spacious, absolutely fire-proof building of several stories, constructed of durable materials, well lighted, modern in equipment, and on such a plan that it can be added to as occasion demands in the future. A site for such a building is already owned by the Government; only the building needs to be provided for. What the Capitol building is to the nation, the Library building to the National Library, the Smithsonian building to the Smithsonian Institution, the new museum building should be to the National Museum.
Exhibition and laboratory space.—If the present building were devoted to the Department of Anthropology, in the new building there should be provided fully 115,000 square feet of exhibition space for the Department of Biology, and for its laboratory and office rooms 75,000 square feet, making a total of 190,000 square feet. The space mentioned is based upon careful estimates of what will be needed for the proper housing of and work on the collections now in hand and that will probably come to the Museum within the present generation. It would be provisionally assigned among the different divisions of the department
as follows: Space needed by the Department of Biology.

It is estimated that 65,000 square feet of exhibition space will be needed in the Department of Geology and 18,000 square feet for its offices and laboratories.
In addition to the laboratories for biology and geology there should also be provided 5,000 square feet of laboratory space for the use of post-graduate and special students who come to Washington to avail themselves of the exceptional opportunities for study offered by the materials brought together in the National Museum and by the investigations carried on in the various scientific bureaus.
There will also be needed a considerable portion of the basement of a building for rough storage, preparators’ shops, taxidermists’ rooms, ete.
Lecture hall.—The need of a suitable lecture hall is imperative. The lecture hall of the American Museum of Natural History has 13,500 square feet of floor space and that of the Field Columbian Museum 4,250 square feet. A suitable hall for the National Museum should include at least 6,000 square feet. and there should also be one or two smaller rooms that could be used for lectures on special topics, when a small audience only is expected.

The American Museum of Natural History, which has 294,000 square feet of space, has so planned its buildings that additions can be made to them as rapidly as funds are available and the increase of the collections demand the space. Less than one-fourth of the structure as originally planned is completed.
With suitable buildings provided, the immediate development of the National Museum naturally lies in three directions. First, the occupation of the present building by the anthropological collections; second, the housing, developing, and installing of the great biological collections, and third, the development of a great museum of practical geology.
First.—The collections in anthropology, as they stand to-day, cover a wide field in a broken and disconnected way. It is difficult to use them effectually to illustrate the great features of this branch of science. They do not present a connected story of the peoples and cultures of the world. This arises from the gaps in the collections and the absence of suitable laboratory and exhibition space. This depart

<<<Page: 39>>>

ment should have adequate representations of the American peoples and their culture, not only of our own country, but of the whole American continent. Our nation is the only one in America that can reasonably be expected to do anything of importance toward the preservation of the materials necessary for the illustration of this vast field, and as the American race is a unit, of which the tribes in our own territory constitute but a fragment, it appears to be our duty to take up this work in a comprehensive way. . Thus would be built up not only a national museum but an American museum in the widest sense. This applies not only to anthropology but to the other great departments of the Museum. It will be impossible to carry on such a work without turning over to the Department of Anthropology the entire present building, with all of its laboratory and exhibition space.
Second.—The Department of Biology now occupies a large exhibition space in the Smithsonian building and 55,000 square feet in the National Museum building. Large collections, which would be placed on exhibition if space were available, are stored in laboratories and inclosed spaces in the exhibition halls. As has already been explained, in a new building there should be available for the Department of Biology 190,000 square feet of exhibition, laboratory, and storage space.
The present exhibit is more complete than that of the other departments of the Museum. Of birds there is a large mounted series, one of the finest in existence, but it is so indifferently housed that it fails to make the impression it should. Of mammals there is a good North American series and some excellent examples of exotic species. There is a good and rather large exhibit of the various groups of the lower forms of animals, including an especially fine series of corals and sponges.
These are the only series at present exhibited which can be considered at all comprehensive. Of the great groups of fishes, reptiles, and amphibians there is room only for an outline representation. The wonderful variety of form among insects can be scarcely more than suggested in the space available. Of plants there has hitherto been no exhibit worthy of the name, and the space which it has now been possible to set aside is entirely out of proportion to the vast extent and importance of this great kingdom of nature.
Every natural-history museum of the first class should have at least two comprehensive exhibition series—tirst, the Systematic Series, representing the natural groups among which all animals and plants, from the highest to the lowest, are divided; second, the Faunal and Floral Series, showing the animals and plants characteristic of each of the grand divisions of the earth’s surface which naturalists have established as a result of their studies of these two kingdoms of nature.
These two great comprehensive exhibits should be supplemented by a number of Special Series, illustrating the more interesting phenomena and phases of life, such as the macroscopic and microscopic structure of

<<<Page: 40>>>

animals and plants and their development from the germ to the fully adult individual, and special modifications of form and color by which animals are protected from their enemies, the adaptations for peculiar environments and modes of life, the characteristics of youth, maturity, and old age, the variation in form, size, and color among individuals of the same species, the domiciles and other works constructed by birds, mammals, insects, and the like.
To these series should be added another of great importance, the Economic Series, representing the animals and plants as related to the activities and needs of man.
Any one of these principal series in its full development would more than fill the entire space now available.
Third.—There should be developed a museum of practical geology in the broadest sense, which will be of service to every producer and consumer of American mineral products, and to all students of geology who are engaged in either economic or purely scientific investigations.
In addition to the series of rocks and fossils illustrating the stratigraphy and succession of the sedimentary rocks and the systematic collection of minerals and ores, an exhibit showing how geologic work benefits the daily life of the people should be developed. An illustration of this would be a representation of the artesian water supply of the semiarid region, showing the stratification and structure of the sedimentary rocks, and how hydrographic and geological investigations clearly indicate the regions in which artesian water development may be carried on successfully. Mining and areal geology could also be illustrated in such manner as to place before the student and intelligent observer the import and value of such work.
In most museums the principal effort has been to make a collection
of useful mineral products. This is desirable, but from a broad view of illustrating the practical in addition to the scientific side of geology it should be secondary. The best basis for classification on the practical side of the museum exhibit appears to be the finished mineral product. For instance, if pig iron be taken as a key material in classification, the iron ores from which it has been obtained should be arranged so as to show the various kinds whose combination has resulted in the final result as pig iron. In connection with this should be grouped the geological phenomena, which should include representations of any geological conditions connected with the original deposition and the occurrence of iron ores. This might inelude the conditions which have led to the oxidation of pyrite and other sulphur compounds of iron, and to the development of hydrous oxides of iron; also an illustration of what has been demonstrated in regard to the solution of widely distributed minerals in certain rocks and their subsequent concentration in ore bodies by metasomatic action. All of the metals could be arranged under such a classification, as also the nonmetallic products. To prepare such an exhibit would require many years of work, the details of which would be considered as each mineral product was taken in hand.

<<<Page: 41>>>

Some of the preceding suggestions have been adopted by the Museum authorities and partially put into execution, and the carrying of them out is dependent upon enlarged facilities for laboratory work and exhibition space. During the administration of Dr. Goode, the Museum developed as far as possible under the conditions surrounding it. No one knew better than he that only by securing new buildings and expanding the Museum could it take the place in America that the several national museums of Europe had taken in their respective countries. It is well recognized that a public museum is a necessity in every highly civilized community, and that, as has been so well stated by Dr. Goode, “the degree of civilization which any nation, city, or province has attained is best shown by the character of its public museums and the liberality with which they are maintained.” At present New York City is, in this respect, in advance of all other American cities and of the National Government. Whether the latter will take its proper place by developing the National Museum as it has developed the National Library remains to be seen. The question whether they are willing to be represented by the Museum as it is to-day is before the American people.

By Wi.Lu1AmM H. HOLMEs, Head Curator.
It is convenient to present the matter of the present report under the following heads:
I. General administrative work. Il. Acquirement of Museum materials. Ill. Preservation of collections. IV. Classification and research. YV. Installation. VI. The Anthropological exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.
A partial reorganization of the Museum made at the beginning of the year resulted in the formation of three departments, one of which is Anthropology. The various divisions and sections dealing with man and his works, which have been conducted independently of one another, the curators and custodians reporting directly to the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum, are now united under a head curator of anthropology. This operates to give direct expert supervision of all the divisions and properly correlates the various branches of acomplex work. The head curator took charge October 1, 1897, and a number of changes were made in the scientific staff of the department and in the limitations of the fields occupied by the various curators and custodians. The present organization is indicated in Appendix I.
There are a number of sections included in the department not yet assigned to any one of the above divisions, and these remain for the present under the direct supervision of the head curator. The present classification of the material and the assignment of the staff are by no means final. It was found impossible to devise a scheme that would satisfy the requirements of scientific classification and at the Same time accommodate itself to the acquirements of the present staff, which is composed of persons devoted each to special portions of the field of anthropology. It is expected that as the various branches of the work become fully developed and the collections are enriched and rounded out so that a systematic treatment of the whole field is possible, the questions of reclassification and rearrangement of the
force will gradually adjust themselves. 19

<<<Page: 45>>>

The clerical and other nonscientific work of the department has been conducted as in preceding years, save that some changes in routine, intended to facilitate the transaction of business, have been introduced. Official correspondence is carried on almost wholly through the Museum Office of Correspondence and the executive officer of the Museum. The records are thus less scattered and more generally accessible than if in the*hands of many individuals. The work of receiving, recording, marking, and placing accessions is well provided for in the official routine, and the necessary poisoning of specimens, repairs, making of replicas and models, the building of group exhibits, ete., are in the hands of expert preparators.
During the year two notable episodes have diversified the work of the department, viz, the building of galleries, and the preparation of exhibits for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition held in Omaha. Iron galleries were constructed in four of the seven anthropological halls and this has not only seriously interfered with the progress of installation, throwing the halls affected into confusion for several months, but has made it necessary to reinstall the major part of the exhibits in all the halls. From year to year the spaces have become gradually overcrowded with exhibits, and the opening of the galleries afforded the opportunity of relieving the congestion in part. The first step in this reassemblage of collections was the selection of furniture to accord with the spaces and the collections, and the head curator has devoted much time to the utilization of the various styles of cases to the best advantage. Necessary alterations and repairs were made in cases, pedestals, screens, etc., as the work progressed. In reassembling the furniture, much attention was given to the opening of thoroughfares, the widening of spaces, and in systematizing and simplifying the installation. The work on the main floor is now well advanced, but, in the galleries where wall cases are in process of construction and in halls where floors are being laid, it remains far from complete.
For a period of three months, ending with June 1, the energies of the department were largely devoted to the preparation of an exhibit for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, a detailed account of which is given in another place.
A primary function of the department is the acquirement of Museum materials. These materials include specimens and the data relating to them. Specimens consist of the actual objects, derived from every part of the anthropological field, and of models and casts, as well as of photographs and other representations of the actual objects. The channels through which they are acquired are (1) gift; (2) transfer (from the Smithsonian Institution and departments of the Government); (3) purchase; (4) collection; (5) exchange, and (6) manufacture. To these materials are added deposit or loan collections, the treatment of

<<<Page: 46>>>

which is identical with that of bona fide acquisitions. The administration of the function of acquisition in the department is uniform with that of other departments.
Gifts.—The accessions for the year have been numerous and valuable, and details relating to them will be found in another place. Among the gifts are some of notable importance. A collection of antiquities and ethonological material, the bequest of the late W. Hallett Phillips, of Washington, is not only of great extent but of exceptional value to archeological science, having been collected and recorded with care by Mr. Phillips, who was a conscientious and discriminating devotee of archeological research. The collection contains 12,467 ancient relics, mainly stone implements from the Potomac region, and 106 ethnological specimens from Polynesia. The latter material was collected by Mr. Henry Adams, of Washington, during a prolonged voyage among the Pacific islands.
Transfers.—The Smithsonian Institution, through the agency of its Bureau of American Ethnology, has acquired by purchase and transferred to the Museum two collections of importance—a valuable series of ancient stone and earthenware utensils from graves and mounds in Arkansas, and a collection of antiquities from mounds of the well-known Etowah group of Georgia, nade by Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Georgia. The latter lot, together with the material previously obtained from the same locality by agents of the Bureau of Ethnology, forms one of the most instructive assemblages of archeological material ever brought together from the mound region.
A noteworthy accession of the year is a collection of 2,206 human crania transferred to the Museum from the Army Medical Museum, through the courtesy of Surgeon-General G. M. Sternberg. This collection has been accumulating for many years and represents mainly the Indian tribes, ancient and modern, of North America. Much of the material was acquired through National Museum agencies and was turned over to the Medical Museum for the benefit of the corps of students of physical anthropology connected with that institution. It includes only nonpathologic remains and is to form the nucleus of a division of physical anthropology in the Anthropological Department.
Deposits.—Of the various collections loaned to the Museum during the year, and at the same time offered for sale, two are of more than usual importance. (1) A very extensive series of stone implements and other ancient relics from various parts of Georgia, owned by Dr. Roland Steiner, and (2) a collection of ethnological material from the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Indian tribes, made by Emile Granier, of Paris. Itis expected that these collections will be acquired by the Museum at an early date. Other loan collections worthy of note are (1) aseries of personal mementos of Gen. W.S. Hancock, deposited by Cadet G. R. Hancock, of West Point Military Academy, and a number of important Jewish religious ceremonial objects deposited by Mr.

<<<Page: 47>>>

H. E. Benguiat. A valuable collection of Japanese porcelains, loaned by Miss E. R. Scidmore, is now installed in the Gallery of Ceramics.
The Section of Electricity, Division of Mechanical Technology, has been especially fortunate in acquiring material, and the following statement of Mr. G. C. Maynard, custodian of the Section of Electricity, is quoted from the report of Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator.
One of the most important accessions received during the year is an extensive collection of apparatus deposited by Prof. Alexander Graham Bell. This deposit embraces a large number of pieces of apparatus made and used by Professor Bell in his experiments and researches in various branches of electrical science. The invention and development of the speaking telephone, from the first crude experimental device to the most perfect instrument now in use, is clearly illustrated by a series of objects showing the various advancing steps by which the new art of telephony was created. :
Another interesting portion of the collection is the apparatus devised and used by Mr. Bell in his photophonic experiments, including the original instrument with which, on the 2d of June, 1880, he successfuily transmitted articulate speech by means of a beam of light from the roof of the Franklin School building, in Washington, to his laboratory on L street, a distance of 213 meters. Mr. Bell contributed his original induction balance apparatus, including that devised by him for the purpose of locating the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield, and similar apparatus of later dates. In addition to the above the accession includes Bell’s multiplex telegraph instruments, his induction balance audiometer, for testing hearing, and an Edison phonograph of the earliest pattern, in which the sound waves are recorded on a sheet of tin foil.
The deposits made by the General Electric Company are of much interest and value. Among the historical objects are the first Thomson-Houston three-coil, are-light dynamo, made in 1879, which formed the basis of the Thomson-Houston electric lighting system, the first automatic regulator used with this machine, a dynamo and electric motor used in the Thomson-Houston factory at New Britain in 1880-1881, the first electric welding machine made by Thomson, and many other pieces of original apparatus connected with the early use of electricity for lighting, the transmission of power, and other purposes. Another contribution from the same company 1s one of the first incandescent electric-lighting dynamos, made and put in operation by Edison in 1879, on board the steamship Columbia, of the Oregon Steamship Navigation Company, which was the first steamboat equipped with incandescent electric lights. This dynamo was continued in active use for a period of nearly twenty years, and is still serviceable. Especial interest attaches to this machine for the reason that it is one of the first lot of four dynamos made in this country for commercial incandescent electric lighting. One of the others formed part of the eyuipment of the polar exploring vessel Jeannette, commanded by Captain De Long, on its cruise into the Arctic Sea, where it was lost in 1882. Contributions of a series of historical incandescent lamps and specimens of insulated conductors have also been received from the General Electric Company.
The Coe Brass Manufacturing Company, of Ansonia, Connecticut, through its president, Mr. George F. Brooker, presented to the Museum ten dynamos made between the years 1873 and 1879, by William Wallace, for the generation of electricity for electric lighting, electroplating, and other purposes. Some of these machines were in practical operation during the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and are said to be the first are-light dynamos used for public lighting in this country.
An electric generator of still earlier date than any of those referred to was made by Charles A. Seeley in 1867. In regard to this machine it is said that early in the year 1867, when the principle of self-excitation in dynamos was new, and in fact

<<<Page: 48>>>

practically unknown except to a few of the most advanced electricians in this country, the subject of electric lighting was broached by Professor Seeley to Mr. Horace Greeley. Mr. Greeley became deeply interested and highly amused at the idea of grinding out electricity with a crank and then making light of it, as he expressed his understanding of Professor Seeley’s description of an are light operated by a dynamo. Mr. Greeley suggested that Seeley should build a dynamo and other apparatus, which were accordingly started at once. The satisfactory results of the experiment led to the publication of an editorial in Mr. Greeley’s paper, the New York Tribune, on March 28, 1867, which foreshadowed the success that has since been attained in the art of electric lighting. The Seeley dynamo and the original electric motor and railway devised in 1834 by Thomas Davenport, who was the first inventor of a method of applying galvanism to produce rotary motion, were received as a deposit from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers through Ralph W. Pope, the secretary of the organization.
The dynamos added to the section during the year represent almost the entire range of American inventions which form the basis of the practical methods of electric lighting, both by are and incandescent lamps, and mark an important epoch in the history of artificial illumination. Duplicates of few, if any, of these machines are in existence.
A Morse telegraph register, presented to the Smithsonian Institution by Prof. Henry Ortmann, of Baltimore, by direction of the late Rev. Henry Schieb, appears to be of especial interest. The instrument was in the possession of Mr. Schieb for many years, and is said to have been used on a private telegraph line operated by him and Professor Morse prior to the building of the public line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844.
Mr. Edward L. Morse has during the year deposited several instruments and documents relating to his father’s telegraphic inventions.
There have been added to the Henry collection a number of experimental electrical instruments found by Miss Mary A. Henry in the possession of Miss Annie Wrightsen, of Albany, from whom the apparatus was purchased.
Results of exploration.—Explorations begun during the preceding year, under the auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology, have yielded material of great value. Excavations conducted by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, near Tucson, Arizona, have resulted in the acquisition of some 1,300 specimens of pottery and other classes of relics, and Mr. J. B. Hatcher, collecting for the Bureau of Ethnology, has forwarded a number of unique ethnological specimens from Patagonia. Explorations undertaken in Brown County, Ohio, by Mr. Gerard Fowke, also for the Bureau, yielded a limited collection of relics from stone-grave burials of the mound builders.
Eaxchange.—The exchanges have not been important, although collections of considerable value have been acquired, as follows: (1) Various ethnological and archeological objects from South America in exchange for pueblo collections with the Field Columbian Museum, of Chicago. (2) A series of flint nodules, flaked flints, and flint working tools from the gun-flint factories of Brandon, England, in exchange for chert quarry refuse from Indian Territory.
Manufacture.—The department relies for many of its most interesting and instructive exhibits upon the skill of its curators and expert preparators. During the year a number of models have been prepared illustrating primitive life, processes, implements, utensils, etc., and

<<<Page: 49>>>

numerous reproductions of objects of interest, in plaster, have been made.
Notwithstanding the large number of accessions and their undoubted . value, it should be noted that the results of the year’s collection are not wholly satisfactory. The meagerness of funds for purchase has made it impossible to secure some of the most important collections offered, and as no provision is made for exploration and systematic expert collection, it is found that, save for the occasional well-ordered collections donated or transferred, the acquisitions are fragmentary and lack the detailed data so essential to the student engaged in research.
Following the acquisition of museum materials are various steps looking to their preservation. The collections for the year have been accessioned, recorded, and marked as usual, and have been stored or placed in the study or exhibition series by the curators. The department suffers much inconvenience from lack of space and facilities for handling the collections. Instead of a well-ordered laboratory in which to open, spread out, examine, compare, and classify specimens as they arrive or as subsequent research goes on, small portions of the exhibition halls have been screened off for the purpose, thus interfering with installation, and often rendering hasty removals and premature Storage necessary. At the close of the year one entire gallery is devoted to laboratory uses and is thus necessarily closed to the public. I regard the lack of laboratory space as extremely detrimental to the interests of the department.
A large part of the ethnological collections require expert attention on their arrival in the Museum. They are unclean and infested with destructive insects, and experienced preparators are required for cleaning and preserving. The latter work is carried on in a small shop in an outbuilding. This is very inconvenient and requires the removal of the collections to be treated from the Museum building to one which is by no means a safe repository for valuable specimens.
The question of storage of material has arisen many times during the year, and numerous collections have been removed to storage. The exhibition halls, although much less crowded than at the beginning of the year, still contain more material than can be properly exhibited. The total surplus is, therefore, very great. The present exhibits occupy 60,000 square feet of space, the entire floor space of the Museum being only about 100,000 feet. The anthropological collections properly installed would fill the entire Museum building.
The third important function of the department relates to the use of the collections in conducting researches looking to exhibition and publication. All possible information relating to the specimens is secured,

<<<Page: 50>>>

and they are studied, compared, and classified. This work is essential to their intelligent utilization, and necessarily precedes installation and publication. It is the work which most constantly employs the attention of the curators and is referred to at length in the reports which they have submitted.
Researches having in view publication of results have been conducted by Prof. O. T. Mason, Dr. Walter Hough, Mr. J. E. Watkins, and Dr. Thomas Wilson. In several cases collectors have engaged in the study of the collections made by themselves. This is true especially of Dr. Fewkes, Mr. Cushing, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. Stewart Culin. Mr. J. D. MeGuire has prepared a monograph on tobacco pipes, employing the collections of the Divisions of Ethnology and Prehistoric Archeeology, and Dr. Edward Eggleston, and Dr. H. Carrington Bolton have made studies of portions of the Copp collection of colonial relics in the Division of History and Biography.
Display of collections constitutes a most important function of the Museum; it may be regarded as the essential function, since all others are as well subserved by the storehouse and laboratory. Public display is the feature that gives the Museum its status as an educational institution. The all-important question then is, in what way and by what methods shall the department undertake to instruct by means of its exhibits? Exhibition is not regarded simply as the presentation of the materials of a museum so that the public may see them. The essential point is the presentation in such logical order that the great truths of human history may be told in the briefest and clearest way.
There are several methods of presenting the materials of anthropology, but two of these are of primary importance and are used to the practical exclusion of the others. The first is the geographical or ethnographical assemblage, and the second the developmental or genetic assemblage. Other methods may be classed as special; they are the chronological, the comparative, the individual, etc. The first mentioned methods are adapted to the presentation of the general truths of anthropology, and the special methods are available for limited portions of the field—for special or limited ideas which are to be fully elaborated.
The most natural assemblage of the materials illustrating the peoples of the world is in groups related one to another as are the peoples themselves in more or less well-defined geographical divisions. Thus assembled it is possible for the student or the ordinary museum visitor to make his studies pretty much as he would make them in traveling from country to country. The museum on this plan is a miniature world, so far as the objective materials of anthropology are capable of

<<<Page: 51>>>

constituting such a world. Under this method of classification all collections coming into the possession of the Museum may be intelligently assembled. From this assemblage, whether as exhibition or study series, selections of duplicate objects may be made for building up exhibits illustrating the history of man as seen from other points of view. ;
The materials employed in this grand division of the exhibits are not yet brought together in the Museum in their final relationships. The collections relating to living tribes and nations are separated from those representing prehistoric peoples of the same areas, the latter occupying the great hall of the Smithsonian Institution. It is hoped that in the near future the construction of a new building, or a reassigninent of the present Museum spaces, may lead to the proper correlation of these important exhibits.
The second grand division of exhibits assumes to present selected portions of the collections on a totally different plan from the preceding, and they are thus made to record and convey a totally distinct class of ideas. The story told by these exhibits is not that of tribes or .nations and their connection with particular environments, but that of development of the race along the various lines of culture progress, each series beginning with the inceptive or lowest stages and extending to the highest. These series are synoptic in character.
The following exhibits arranged on this plan have already been assembled or are in process of segregation: tafe

Each specimen in these series stands not as an isolated product of activity, but for an idea—a step in human progress; each series is a logical assemblage of these ideas—these steps in human progress, and the order is such as to suggest to the mind the broader truths of human history. The group of series properly arranged serves to illustrate the
development of human thought and the gradual expansion of human interests.

There are innumerable subjects covering limited portions of the anthropological field that call for special elaboration and separate assemblage of materials. The history of a single nation may be thus treated, as, for example, the history of the United States, a mostappropriate subject for our National Museum; the history of Trance, appropriate to a French museum, the order of presentation being chronological. An elaborate assemblage of exhibits may be made for cyclopedical or reference use merely, as in the case of our former section of materia medica, but this method is not applicable to any large portion of the field of anthropology. Other exhibits still may serve for purposes of comparison of what different peoples do living under distinct environments, as, for example, the series of drinking vessels in the East Hall; of what has been accomplished by different nations or establishments, as in the ceramic section.
The accompanying ground plan will serve to indicate the distribution of the grand divisions of exhibits in the Museum building. The collections of prehistoric archeology, placed in the great hall of the Smithsonian Institution, belong to Group A.

Grand divisions of anthropological exhibits in the Museum building.
The areas occupied by the three grand divisions are indicated by letters as follows:
A. Geographical presentation of men and culture.
B. Developmental presentation of human activities.
C. Special presentations of activities and phenomena.
Four great halls and their galleries are devoted to exhibits assembled on the geographical plan (A), the peoples of the world being repre

<<<Page: 53>>>

sented with as much completeness as the limitations of the national collections will permit. Three of these halls are occupied by American materials and one by exhibits representing the remainder of the world.
In the West North Range or Catlin Hall (formerly the lecture hall) are brought together, for the first time in any degree of completeness, very extensive collections obtained from Indian tribes of the great region which extends from the Atlantic coast to the Rocky Mountains. These are arranged primarily by provinces, and secondarily by stocks and tribes, but as yet they are only tentatively placed, as the entire hall is to be cleared in the near future for laying a floor and building galleries.
The walls of this hall are completely covered with portraits and scenes representing mainly the great group of tribes assigned to the hall. They are the work of George Catlin, the noted traveler and artist. To this hall are assigned also various groups of lay figures illustrating the tribes concerned, and the windows are to be embellished with a series of photographic transparencies covering the same ground.
The hall known as the Northwest Range contains collections from numerous Indian tribes of the northwest coast region, assembled at the north end, and very complete exhibits from the Eskimo tribes of the arctic regions, assembled in the south end of the hall.
The Northwest Court (Pueblo Court) contains exhibits pertaining to the great group of town-building tribes of Arizona, New Mexico, and adjacent sections, known as Pueblo (town) Indians. ‘The antiquities of the region are also included, as they are known for the most part to pertain to the same general group of peoples. The collection of pottery is very extensive, and the series of lay-figure industrial and ceremonial groups make the display more than usually attractive.
In the gallery of this court are assembled, though not yet fully installed, collections from the tribes of the great arid region of the Southwest, other than the Pueblos, as well as limited series of objects representing the tribes of Mexico, Central America, and South America.
The West Hall contains extensive collections from a multitude of peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the gallery in the north side is occupied by materials from Australia and the Indo-Pacific Islands.
Grand Division B, which includes exhibits arranged to illustrate the progress and achievements of the race in many of its principal arts and industries, occupies three halls and two galleries in the northeast section of the building. A few additional exhibits belonging to this division are still installed in other sections of the Museum. The principles upon which they are assembled have been explained elsewhere. In East Hall adjoining the Rotunda is placed a group of exhibits epitomizing the history of various arts, domestic and industrial. In the eastern portion of the hall are collections. illustrating transportation, electricity, physical experimentation, ete.
The Northeast Range (Boat Hall) is occupied by a very extensive

<<<Page: 54>>>

collection of boats, models of boats, and other exhibits exemplifying the development of water transportation, and especially the progress in steam navigation achieved in recent years by American inventors.
The Northeast Court, main floor, contains the remarkable collections illustrating the graphic arts brought together by Mr. S. R. Koehler, honorary curator, and the gallery is devoted to ceramics and examples of art products in glass, enamel, lacquer, metal, and ivory.
The exhibit of materia medica, brought to a high degree of completeness by the honorary curator, Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. N., is installed in the East Hall Gallery (north side). The more comprehensive title of Division of Medicine having been substituted for that of ‘‘ materia medica,” heretofore used, it is proposed to arrange and develop the collection on the lines adopted for other branches of human activity, and to attempt to illustrate the history of medicine, or the evolution of ideas concerning disease and its treatment. The following provisional classification is taken from Dr. Flint’s annual report:
A. Magical Medicine. 1. Exorcism, invocation, and incantation. 2. Amulets, talismans, and fetiches, B. Psychical Medicine. 1. ‘Laying on of hands.” 2. Suggestion. 3. Hypnotism. 4. Faith cure. . Physical and External Medicine. 1. Baths, massage, exercise, electricity. 2. Surgery, including acupuncture, cautery, blood letting, and surgical operations in general. D. Physiological or Internal Medicine.
1. Drugs (illustrations arranged in the following groups: (a) Egyptian medicine; (b) Greek medicine; (¢) Hindoo medicine; (d) Arabian medicine; (e) Oriental medicine; (jf) Indian medicine; (g) Modern medicine.
E. Preventive Medicine.
1. Water.
2. Air. 3. Food. 4 5
. Beverages and condiments. . Soils.
6. Habitations.
7. Clothing.
8. Climate.
9. Disposal of the dead.
10. Disinfection.
The third grand division of exhibits, the Special, is represented by a number of collections of importance. The North Hall is occupied by a large series of exhibits arranged chronologically to illustrate the history of the United States. Beginning at the left, just within the north door, the period of discovery is presented. This is followed in order by the Colonial and Revolutionary periods, the war of 1812-14,

<<<Page: 55>>>

the Mexican war, ete. Continuing on the west side are collections illustrating the period of the civil war and notable personages and episodes pertaining to it and to succeeding periods.
The Division of Religions occupies the West Hall Gallery (south side), where interesting exhibits are assembled in groups illustrating the Jewish, Mohammedan, Buddhistic, and other religions. The large collection of musical instruments occupies the wall cases of the North Hall; various collections of ceramic products, glass, metal work, etc., grouped by peoples or manufacturing establishments, are placed in the gallery of the Northeast Court, and exhibits illustrating the composition of the human body and the analysis of foods and drinks occupy part of the East Hall Gallery (north side).
The frequency with which the National Museum has been called upon to prepare exposition exhibits has made it somewhat difficult to secure fresh and interesting material for display. To obviate this difficulty in the Department of Anthropology it was decided to assemble the limited group of exhibits required on a plan differing essentially from that adopted for previous expositions.
Heretofore the materials have been brought together in a somewhat disconnected way, to illustrate particular peoples, or especial arts or industries as represented by their products. On the present occasion the activities of man are treated from the point of view of their development. The various lines of progress are represented by a series of objects, each typifying a step in the industrial and intellectual Syomuge of the race.
As the exhibits required had to be drawn from all divisions of the department, a single series of objects in many cases being made up from the collections of two or more divisions or sections, members of the anthropological staff were called upon to act as committees in assembling the exhibits in which they were personally concerned. The full resources of the Museum were thus drawn upon, yet the objects taken were so few in number as not to interfere seriously with the present Museum installation.
Each series of exhibits epitomizes a single branch of art or industry and occupies a single case-front or fraction thereof, and may thus be conveniently seen at one view. The scheme of treatment or presentation is just such as the systematic student would adopt in writing the history of the subject, beginning with the inceptive stages and moving forward step by step to the highest development. The following subjects are presented, beginning at the left in the cases and progressing toward the right:
The use of fire-—The story begins with the fire of voleanoes and lightning and the carrying of firebrands from the sources for rekindling,

<<<Page: 56>>>

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. on
illustrated by means of colored drawings; it is continued in a series of exhibits showing progressive steps in the making of fire, illustrated by rubbing sticks, revolving drills, flint and steel, the lucifer match, and devices for producing the electric spark.
Illumination.—Two series of objects are chosen, the first illustrating the torch in its many forms, arranged progressivly ; the second, the lamp, beginning with the stone cup with oil and wick and ending with the argand burner and the are light.
Fishing.—Of the various exploitative activities, so necessary to the sustenance of the race, only one group—the art of fishing—is represented, others having been omitted for want of space. Series 1 illustrates the dart in its multiplicity of forms; series 2, the various toggle devices; series 3, the hook; series 4, the sinker.
Domestic arts.—Household arts are represented by four series—one epitomizing the history of cooking, and three illustrating utensils and devices employed in eating and drinking (the cup, the spoon, and the knife and fork).
Tools of general use.—The history of the more essential tools of human handicraft is epitomized in seven series, each beginning with the simplest forms—wmere splinters and masses of stone—and ending with the highest forms, the marvelous machine-operated’ tools of to-day. They are the hammer, the ax, the adz, the knife, the saw, the drill, and the scraper.
Weapons.—Weapons of war have performed a most important part in the history of progress, and the steps that led up from the stone and the club held in the hand to the steel sword and compound machine gun are strikingly suggested in two series presented: 1, weapons for use in the hand—piercing and slashing weapons; and 2, projectile weapons—the bow and arrow, the crossbow, the pistol and gun.
Transportation, marine.—The history of water transportation is epitomized in four of its leading lines of elaboration: 1, the hull, beginning with the log raft and ending with the magnificent substructure of the modern ship (represented by models); 2, hand propulsion—the pole, the paddle and the oar (in part models); 3, the paddle wheel (models); and 4, the screw propeller (models).
Transportation, land.—Land transportation is shown in six series (models): 1, the burden bearer, man and beast; 2, the sliding load; 3, the rolling load; 4, the wheeled vehicle; 5, the steam locomotive; and 6, the railway track.
The great group of elaborative activities concerned in manufacture is illustrated in four exhibits: The ceramic art, the textile art, metal work, and sculpture.
Ceramic art.—In this exhibit are included four series: 1, implements and devices employed in manufacture—modeling tools, decorating tools, stamps, molds, and the throwing wheel; 2, the vase, showing progressive steps in shaping, decorating, and the results of firing on

<<<Page: 57>>>

the paste and surface finish; 3, glass making in its relation to ceramics; and 4, enamel. ;
Textile art.—Weaving is represented by three series: 1, the spindle; 2, the shuttle; and 3, the loom; the latter illustrating in a remarkable manner the rapid transition from primitive to highly developed appliances.
Metal working.—The history of this important branch is partially presented in three series: 1, metal reduction; 2, products of manufacture, showing progressive order in processes, forms, and embellishments ; and 3, tools and appliances of manufacture.
Sculpture—The stone-shaping arts begin with the simplest known artificial modifications of natural forms and advance to the achievement of the highest ideals as represented in Greek art. Four series | are shown: 1, prehistoric stone shaping (Europe); 2, aboriginal American sculpture; 3, sculpture of civilized nations; and 4, implements used in stone shaping. Series 1, 2, and 3 are separated for the purpose of contrasting the work of distinct periods and peoples.
Photography.—This art, the product of advanced culture, is represented by three series of objects, epitomizing the development of: 1, the camera; 2, the lens; and 3, the picture.
The book.—A limited series of objects is devoted to the history of the book, the method of assembling the several parts—the tablets and sheets—being the feature considered.
Electricity—Electrical inventions, representing one of the youngest and most marvelous branches of human activity, are shown in three limited series—l1, experimental apparatus (Henry); 2, transmitting apparatus (Morse and subsequent inventors); and 3, recording apparatus.
Music.—Four series are devoted to the history of as many varieties of musical instruments—1, wind instruments; 2, reed instruments; 3, stringed instruments; and 4, percussion instruments.
The system of arranging these series is such as to make them fully intelligible to the average museum or exposition visitor. A large label or sign is framed and placed outside of each case at the top; a general label for each exhibit, giving briefly the history of the subject treated, is framed and placed inside the case. Also a label explaining each progressive series is placed at the beginning of the series, and individual labels describing the specimens are placed with the specimens.
Associated with these developmental series are a number of lifesize figures, modeled in plaster and appropriately costumed, intended to illustrate the practice of the arts in their primitive stages. They give a vivid impression of primitive processes and serve to contrast these with the methods and machinery of advanced civilization. The subjects presented are as follows:
The fire maker.—A. Ute Indian making fire by twirling, between the palms of his hands, a wooden shaft with its point set into a second piece of wood.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE,
Head Curator.
The Department of Biology was established at the opening of the fiscal year, July 1, 1897, by bringing together under a separate administrative head the several zoological divisions already existing in the Museum, and the Division of Plants. The collections represented by these various divisions together constitute the larger part of the Museum, and have been accumulating for nearly half a century. The majority of the divisions themselves have been in existence since the reorganization of the Museum, in 1881, and several of them for a much longer period.
On account of the great length of time that the collections have been in existence, and the well defined and long-established methods of systematic zoology and botany, no radical changes in the mode of conducting the administrative or scientific business of the divisions has been necessary or in contemplation. The efforts of the head curator in the past year have been, as they probably will be in the future, largely in the direction of developing those features which in the past, for various causes, have not had due prominence.
The conditions prevailing as regards space and amount of assistance are far from ideal, and until much increased facilities in these directions have been provided it seems improbable that any great general advance can be made.
On the side of the exhibition of collections (the matter which appeals most directly to the public) the deficiency is in the nature of insufficient and unsuitable space. Without a rearrangement which would involve both of the other departments of the Museum and an amount of work incommensurate with the result obtained, the proper sequence of exhibition collections can not be had in the present quarters.
At the close of the last year the birds, reptiles, fishes, and mollusks and other invertebrates, except insects, were displayed in the Smithsonian building, while the mammals, insects, and collections representing comparative anatomy were displayed in the Museum building. As any general transfer of the birds is impracticable at the present time, endeavor was made to at least somewhat improve the sequence by removing the insects to the Smithsonian building and transferring the exhibits of batrachians, reptiles, and fishes to the Museum building. This was accomplished without a great amount of labor or expense,

<<<Page: 61>>>

' and is a gain to the extent of bringing all the exhibits of invertebrates together in the Smithsonian building.
The erection of galleries in the Museum building, while it did not involve as much rearrangement in this department as in those of anthropology and geology, nevertheless made a complete reinstallation of the large exhibition series of mammals unavoidable.
This change brought to view the desirability of having the zoological collections, for the most part at least, arranged in accordance with some one comprehensive plan. While many schemes of more or less merit suggested themselves, the limitations as regards the extent and character of the space at command were such as to preclude most of them; while the anticipation that a new building may be provided at no very distant time in the future, made the adoption of others seem undesirable. After giving the matter serious thought, I decided that the zoological exhibits should be arranged on a taunal basis, special prominence being given to the faunas of the United States. This principal series is to be supplemented by various smaller special series, illustrating important topics in biology. The adoption of this plan, it is believed, will cause the exhibits to be more significant and more attractive to the public than hitherto, and at the same time the labor and expense involved in effecting the modification will be limited.
A good start in this direction has been made during the past year in connection with the mammals, batrachians, reptiles, and fishes. The greatest change, as already stated, was made necessary in the Division of Mammals on account of the erection of galleries in the south hall of the Museum building, in which the exhibits are placed. The cases containing groups of large mammals could no longer stand in the center of the hall, and were therefore arranged at the sides under the galleries. The main floor is now devoted to an American faunal collection, and the galleries to the faunas of the rest of the world. It is the intention to make the North American series complete, but other faunas can only be represented by genera, even if it were desirable to do so, on account of lack of space. The old wall cases were removed to the gallery, and it is the intention to add to them at the beginning of the next fiscal year, so that they will occupy the whole of the wall surface on both sides of the gallery. Floor cases along the railings will be employed for the smaller species.
The American batrachians, reptiles, and fishes were brought together in the southeast range. At the close of the year the cases in the Smithsonian building containing marine invertebrates were rearranged, but a complete reinstallation of the specimens and a modification of a majority of the cases will be needed. The cases containing exhibits of insects were removed, as already stated, to the Smithsonian building, but no work has as yet been done on them. No extensive change is at present In contemplation in connection with the exhibits of birds, mollusks, or comparative anatomy.

<<<Page: 62>>>

Hitherto the Museam has had no botanical exbibition series, except a small collection of specimens of native and foreign woods, pictures of trees, etc., intended to illustrate the subject of forestry. This collection was withdrawn from exhibition some years ago. To form a really significant botanical exhibit itis recognized that it will be necessary to begin de novo. Any advance in this direciion is hedged about by difficulties because of insufficient space. A beginning has, however, been made by mounting under glass a representative series of seaweeds. To these it is the intention to add outline series representing other groups of plants, and to supplement these by special exhibits, such as illustrations of poisonous plants, models of poisonous and edible fungi, etc. The plans for these are, however, subject to modification in the coming months, and it is even possible that the construction of galleries in the ranges, and in particular in the southeast range, for which provision was made by Congress, will prevent any further installation of exhibition collections during the coming year.
The additions to the zoological and botanical collections during the year have been very numerous, and in some directions unusually important. First should be mentioned the donation by Messrs. Henry G. Hubbard and E. A. Schwarz of their collection of Coleoptera, principally North American, comprising about 200,000 specimens, and representing, approximately, 12,000 species. The addition of this great and important collection places the National Museum in advance of all others as regards North American Coleoptera, and the generosity of the donors in presenting this vast amount of material, which they have accumulated with so much labor and expense, can not be too highly extolled.
The labors of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for so many years has been a most generous benefactor of the Museum, demand liberal commendation. During the past year this indefatigable collector presented to the Museum large collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and other animals from Lower Siam and Kashmir. The Abbott collection comprises the larger portion of the most valuable Old World material of the Museum. Dr. W. L. Ralph has continued his valuable gratuitous additions to the collection of birds’ eggs, and in this connection should also be mentioned the gift of Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, comprising more than 600 bird skins, 900 eggs, and 250 birds’ nests from the Philippine Islands. The friendly cooperation of Dr. L. T. Chamberlain has resulted in large additions to the collection of fresh-water mussels. The largest acquisition of the year in this direetion was the gift of Dr. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, comprising over 86,000 specimens. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, presented a very interesting series of bird skias, 170 in number, from Santa Marta, Colombia.
The additions to the herbarium for the year exceed 40,000 specimens, of which about one-half were obtained by purchase. Gifts of plants

<<<Page: 63>>>

have been numerous and amount together to about 4,000 specimens. Prof. O. F. Cook presented 662 specimens of Liberian plants in excellent condition and of much interest. Dr. B. L. Robinson, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, presented a large series of valuable Mexican plants, numbering in all about 1,700 specimens. ‘These were admirably supplemented by another collection of Mexican plants presented by Mr. E. A. Goldman, of Alila, California. About 6,000 plants were acquired by exchange during the year.
As already stated, about 20,000 herbarium specimens were purchased. Every important American collection offered for sale was obtained, with the result that the National Herbarium has been greatly enriched.
The scientific bureaus of the Government, particularly the U.S. Fish Commission and the Biological Survey and Division of Botany of the Department of Agriculture, have continued to make very valuable additions to the national collections. Especially to be mentioned are the invertebrates collected by the naturalists of the Albatross, in 1896, on the coasts of California, Japan, and Kamchatka, and in Bering Sea, and the specimens obtained by the assistants of the Commission during the past thirteen years, comprising more than 600 lots. Numerous valuable types and cotypes of different species of fishes collected by the Commission have also been transmitted. The Biological Survey collected in Mexico a large series of land shells, which are regarded by Mr. Dall, the curator of the Division of Mollusks, as the most intrinsically valuable acquisition of the year in that direction. Mr. Dall remarks:
This series, collected at various times and localities, contains an unusual number
of fine undescribed species and numerous others new to the collection. The proportion which may be described as really valuable is unusually large.
The accumulation of valuable specimens received singly or in small lots from numerous friends of the Museum deserves notice. An enumeration of these will be found in Appendix I.
With the exception of plants, few purchases of importance were made for the Department during the year, but a series of rodents from Patagonia, collected by Mr. W. A. Peterson, comprising 239 specimens is deserving of notice. The collection of mammals is very deticient in South American specimens, and this material was especially desirable.
An extended reference to the explorations of members of the Museum staff will be found on page 69. Collections were made by Messrs. Rose and Pollard in Mexico and Florida, respectively; by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger in the vicinity of the Commander Islands; by Messrs. Schuchert and White on the coast of Greenland, and by Mr. Robert Ridgway in Florida. The explorations of Mr. R. P. Currie in Liberia were referred to in the last Annual Report, although the larger portion of the material obtained was not received until after the beginning of the present fiscal year.

<<<Page: 64>>>

Some important changes were made in the personnel of the department during the year. In the Division of Insects, Dr. Harrison G. Dyar was appointed custodian of Lepidoptera. Dr. William L. Ralph succeeds the late Maj. Charles Bendire as custodian of the Section of Birds’ Eggs. Mr. W. T. Swingle was appointed custodian of the Section of Algze and Mr. D. G. Fairchild of the Section of Lower Fungi. These gentlemen have rendered exceedingly valuable services in their several sections during the year. The department is indeed dependent for its successful operation at the present time very largely upon the gratuitous, disinterested efforts of its honorary curators and custodians, the value of whose services can not be overestimated.
In the Division of Marine Invertebrates Miss Harriet Richardson and Miss Mary B. Smith served as volunteer assistants.
The routine work of entering, classifying, and caring for the collections in the several divisions has been carried on continuously, and it may be said that the condition of the collections in general is better than ever before. The greatest drawback has been tound in the lack of sufficient laboratory space, the working rooms in some of the divisions being crowded to such an extent that it is almost impossible for the assistants to move about in them. This crowding affects the work in many ways, making the arrangement of collections unavoidably unsystematic, to a large extent, and rendering nearly impossible those operations which require the use or inspection of large numbers of specimens at the same time. The extensive collection of mammals of the Department of Agriculture, including especially the large forms, were brought together in a part of the southeast range, which has been screened off for the purpose, no other space being found for this bulky material. This encroachment upon the exhibition space is considered undesirable, but can not be avoided unless additions are made to the Museum building or a larger structure provided. A similar provision was made for the National Herbarium, in the Division of Plants, a portion of the East Hall gallery being given up for the purpose. The collection of plants has grown to great size and importance and has entirely overflowed the quarters assigned to it a few years since.
In the Division of Mammals the type specimens were brought together and carefully labeled with special red tags where needed. They will be kept hereafter in special cases. The overcrowding in the upper laboratory was somewhat relieved by a rearrangement of specimens, but the case room is at present inadequate. The study series is in an excellent state of preservation, but much in need of a rearrangement, which, however, can not be accomplished until more case room is provided.
In the Division of Birds Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator, reports that a large portion of the series, including all the water birds and waders, was thoroughly overhauled and rearranged in new dust-tight cases, which have been provided for the purpose. Some twenty families still

<<<Page: 65>>>

require attention, and are now, for the most part, crowded into cases which are unsuitable and are practically inaccessible. A special effort has been made during the year to bring together type specimens of birds and to see that they were properly labeled and arranged in cases made for the purpose.
Doctor Ralph devoted a large amount of time to clearing away the accumulation of work in the Section of Birds’ Eggs since the death of Major Bendire. The collection now numbers over 64,000 specimens, and is by far the most extensive in existence. While the eggs themselves are in excellent condition, the collection of nests is only indifferently provided for, and new cases will be needed.
As is fully recognized by the curator, the exhibition series of birds is by no means satisfactory. The cases in the Smithsonian building are old and not dust tight, and are furthermore very much crowded together, on which account, and because of the insufficient lighting in the hall, the collection can not be appreciated at its true value. As already stated in another part of the report, an attempt will probably be made during the coming year to remedy these defects to a certain extent, but the problem is a very difficult one, and it is doubtful whether the exhibit can be brought up entirely to modern standards without more expense than would be justified under present conditions. Special attention was given to some of the series, such as the hornbills, a very striking group, of which the Museum possesses a full collection. This series was entirely overhauled and new forms added.
A special series arranged for children has been for some time exhibited in a small room adjacent to the main hall, and was relabeled throughout during the year.
In the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians, the exhibition series was removed from the Smithsonian to the Museum building, as already stated, and rearranged to form a faunal North American series. The exotic mounted skins, which were indifferent in quality and insufficient in number and variety to form a series of any significance, were boxed and stored, duplicates of American species were removed, and the remainder arranged in systematic order. The curator, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, reports the general collections as being in excellent condi tion, but no extensive operations were carried on, as he was necessarily absent a considerable portion of the year in connection with his duties as a member of the Fur Seal Commission.
The exhibit of the Division of Fishes at the close of the last fiscal year consisted of several cases of casts and a large number of alcoholic specimens in jars, all of which were displayed in one of the smaller halls in the Smithsonian building. For reasons previously stated, the casts were removed to the Museum building, where they were installed in the southeast range in cases more suitable, and in such manner that the characteristics of the American fauna could be appreciated at a glance. The large collection of alcoholics was withdrawn from exhibi

tion, it having been shown that they could scarcely be made interesting or instructive to the public. A place was found for them in the laboratory, which for some time had been occupied by mammals, a change which has the advantage of allowing them to be protected from the light and make them accessible to students without intruding upon the public. Type specimens were placed in special cases and guarded from the light, which causes deterioration.
The cases formerly used for the exhibition of fishes being old and of a pattern not now considered suitable for such purposes, they were removed to the laboratory and there made use of for the better arrangement of the general study series.
Mr. William H. Dall, curator of the Division of Mollusks, reports the great collections of that division in good condition, but calls attention to the inconvenience arising from overcrowding, which increases year by year. A very large amount of material, comprising no less than 3,500 species of shells, was identified for correspondents of the Museum during the year. In connection with this work, however, the Museum receives many valuable specimens.
There has been very great activity in the Division of Insects during the year, which the honorary curator, Dr. L. O. Howard, regards as a phenomenal one in the history of the division. He writes:
The surprising part, however, is in the fact that the actual number of species and specimens and their scientific value surpasses anything in the history of the division, since, notwithstanding the wonderful increase and value of the specimens received last year, due to the extensive exotic material presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, those received during the present year will more than equal those received during the past decade. This increase is due principally to the very large and valuable collection of North American Coleoptera presented by Messrs. Hubbard and Schwarz, while it is worthy of note that the additions, without this collection would be nearly three times as large as those in the previous fiscal year.
The collections are in a better state of preservation than ever before, and a large amount of work has been done in rearranging and classifying specimens. The material in each order has been divided according to continents and arranged systematieally, by which plan the labor of identifying new material is considerably lessened. Dr. Dyar, custodian of Lepidoptera, has rearranged the collections of that order, adding many species from his private collection, and in both ways very greatly increasing the value of the collections. This voluntary work is of much importance to the Museum and is highly appreciated. All the types and cotypes at present in the collection have been properly labeled during the year and recorded in a special catalogue. The whole number of these specimens is nearly 6,000.
The chief operation of the Division of Marine Invertebrates was the preparation of 100 sets of duplicate specimens, designed for distribution to high schools throughout the country. Each set contains specimens representative of about 100 species, and more than 30,000 Specimens are included in the entire series. About one-half of these

<<<Page: 67>>>

sets have already been distributed. The distribution of this large amount of material has relieved the storerooms and cases. As already stated, a considerable change is contemplated in the exhibition series of the division, and at the close of the year work was begun by a readjustment of the the cases in the exhibition hall.
The curator of the Division of Comparative Anatomy, Mr. F. A. Lueas, was absent a considerable portion of the year in connection with his duties as a member of the Fur Seal Commission. On that account, and because he is also charged with the general care of the vertebrate fossils, a large amount of work has not been done on the osteological collections. So far as the exhibition series is concerned this is not detrimental to the Museum, as the series is already very full and very carefully arranged and labeled. The condition of the reserve series, however, is not satisfactory, the curator reporting that more than double the number of drawers now in use are needed for the accommodation of specimens and their proper arrangement and to permit the withdrawal from storage of the large amount of material now practically inaccessible.
In the Division of Plants Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator, reports that several important changes and improvements have taken place.
In order to provide a circulation. aisle for visitors around the East Hall gallery it was necessary to move the screen at the east end back some 4 feet into the botanical laboratory. The loss of space was compensated for by assembling a double row of cases on the south side of the gallery for its whole length, making in all about 200 running feet. Whether this arrangement can be maintained permanently is perhaps doubtful.
Two rooms in the east tower were fitted up for the collection of eryptogamic plants, which, however, is likely to soon outgrow these quarters.
The sectional herbarium, numbering some 30,000 specimens, which was formerly kept in the Section of Paleobotany, was returned to the general collection, and the work of distributing the specimens to their proper places has progressed satisfactorily during the vear.
The separation and’ marking of type specimens has been continued. During the year 252 such specimens were marked, inaking a total thus far of 1,596. ;
Scientific investigations of more or less wide scope have been carried on in the several divisions of the department during the year, and tle results obtained are very creditable to the staff. Mr. Robert Ridgway has made satisfactory progress on the comprehensive manual of North and Middle American birds, which he has had in preparation for a considerable time. The head curator of the department has continued studies on the cetaceans, and has completed a paper on the nomenclature of the whalebone whales of the North Atlantic... Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., has been engaged in an investigation of the Free-tailed bats.

<<<Page: 68>>>

He has published several minor papers on mammals during the year, Dr. T. H. Bean has continued work on the collections of fishes made by the Tish Commission steamer Albatross in South American waters, and has made investigations in the waters of New York with special reference to fish life. Mr. Barton A. Bean has continued investigations on the.collections of Mexican fishes and has completed one portion of the work, the results of which are now in hand for publication. He also made a study of the fishes of Wallowa Lake, Oregon, for the U.S. Fish Commission, the results of which are given in a report already in the hands of the Commissioner. Mr. W. H. Dall has devoted considerable time to a revision of the bivalve shells in connection with his work on the Tertiary invertebrate fauna, and has made various minor investigations, The study of the fresh-water mussels has been continued by Mr. C. H. Simpson with important results. Dr. L. O. Howaid has continued studies on the parasitic insects of the family Encyrtine, especially those parasitic on the Coccid, and has completed one paper on that group. Mr. W. H. Ashmead has nearly completed his monograph of the insects of the family Braconidie, which he has had in hand for several years, and has worked up four large collections of Hymenoptera. The collections of insects made by Messrs, Stejneger and Barrett-Hamilton, of the Fur Seal Commission, on the Commander Islands, bave been worked up and reported upon by Messrs. Schwarz, Dyar, Coquillett, Banks, and Cook. The results will be published in the report of the Fur Seal Commission. Mr. Coquillett completed his monograph of the flies of the family Tachinidie and his revision of the Simulidie, and both have been published. He also worked up the Japanese Diptera, received from Professor Mitsukuri, and completed a revision of the family Scatophagide. He has under hand revisions of the Helomyzide and Sapromyzidw. Prof. O. Ff. Cook has continued studies on the Myriapoda and the Orthopteran insects of the families Mantide and Phasmide. Mr. J. EK. Benedict has completed his studies of several groups of Isopod Crustaceans and published reports on the Arcturide and the genera Synidotea and Idotea. He has continued work on the Galatheidie and has in preparation a paper on the genus Munidopsis. Miss M. J. Rathbun completed a paper on the Decapod Crustaceans of Jamaica and on the Brachyuran Crustacea coliected by the Iowa University expedition of 1893 to the Florida Keys and Bahamas. She also compieted three minor papers on Crustaceans and made other studies in that group.
Mr. J. N. Rose, assistant curator in the Division of Plants, has devoted a considerable portion of the year to the determination of the botanical material collected by him in Mexico, with a view to the publication of the results of lis observations.
The collections of the department have been made use of extensively by naturalists throughout the country and abroad, various series and single specimens being loaned, as in previous years, for investigation.

<<<Page: 69>>>

(For a detailed list of loans see page 64.) The loans of botanical material have been very numerous, aggregating in all about 3,900 specimens. Included in the records of loans are the names of the botanical departments of Columbia, Cornell, and Harvard universities and other universities and colleges, together with botanical gardens and museums at home and abroad. In addition to these loans of specimens the collections have been studied in Washington by numerous specialists during the year. The naturalists of the U.S. Fish Commission and of the Biological Survey and other bureaus of the Department of Agriculture have of course had free access to the collections, and have made use of them to a considerable extent.
The publications for the year (a list of which will be found in the Bibliography) show a gratifying activity on the part of the scientific staff of the department, and indicate also the large extent to which the collections are being used by naturalists generally.
Considerable time was occupied during the year in preparations for an exhibit at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, at Omaha, Nebraska. The exhibit which was planned by the head curator, and assembled with great success by the heads of the several divisions, consists of a representation of the aquatic faunas and marine plants of the United States. Every group of animals inhabiting our waters is included, from the lowest to the highest, and an extensive and most excellent series of seaweeds. The large mounted birds and the casts of fishes and reptiles are displayed in a large wall case constructed for the purpose. The remainder of the exhibit is shown in narrow floor cases, with full plate-glass fronts. It includes some novelties, such as jelly fish preserve:l in formalin, which have probably not been seen at any previous exposition. The whole series is carefully labeled. .

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, Head Curator.
The past year has been one of great, if not unparalleled, progress in the department. This for the reason that under the reorganization which was effected early in the year, proper coordination of the various divisions was for the first time rendered possible.
Owing to the suspension of work of all kinds in the exhibition halls during the construction of the new galleries and exhibition cases, together with the prolonged absence of the head curator in Europe, it is true, however, that but little of this progress is as yet evident to the public.
Since actively assuming charge of the department, early in November, the head curator has devoted much time to going over the written and printed records of the various United States exploring expeditions and surveys with a view to ascertaining what geological materials had been collected which could be properly considered the property of the Government, and what disposition had been made of the same. This has resulted in bringing together some of the scattered materials which had been loaned in years past for study purposes, or which had never been turned over to the custody of the Museum. Moreover, so soon as it became apparent that the department was ready and more than willing to take charge of the materials, Prof. O. C. Marsh announced his readiness to turn over the large series of vertebrate fossils collected under his direction during his connection with the U.S. Geological Survey under J. W. Powell. Mr. Lucas, the acting assistant curator of the Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, spent four weeks, with proper assistance, at New Haven in May and June of this year, with the result that two carloads of these fossils, comprising many specimens of Triceratops, besides Dinoceras, Hlotheriwm, and other Miocene forms, have already been received.
Arrangements have been made, through the administrator of the estate of the late E. D. Cope,for the return to the Museum of the extensive series of Eocene fishes, collected principally during the years 1872-73 in Utah and Wyoming, and retained by Professor Cope for study. It is confidently expected that these will reach the Museum even before this report appears in print.
In addition to the collection of vertebrate fossils already noted, the
division has obtained, through purchase, a valuable collection of Mosa45

<<<Page: 71>>>

saurs from the Cretaceous of western Kansas, two collections of Elasmobranch teeth -and spines from the Carboniferous of Iowa, and an unusually fine skull and fore-limb bones of Claosaurus.
Through the U. S. Geological Survey was obtained a small collection of vertebrates, including a new species of Dinictis and a Suilline from the Miocene of Dakota.
The Section of Invertebrate Paleontology has likewise been greatly enriched, the two most important accessions being gifts. Through the bequest of the late Mr. I. H. Harris the Museum has come into the possession of his private collection of over 20,000 specimens of fossils. This is one of the finest collections ever mode from the rocks of the Cincinnati group, and is particularly rich in starfishes, crinoids, and trilobites, and, moreover, contains a number ‘of original types.
Mr. Rh. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pennsylvania, to whom the Museum is already so largely indebted, has presented his extensive collection of fossil insects. This comprises upwards of 4,640 specimens, of which more than 200 are types. In addition, he also presented 97 other invertebrate fossils, 408 vertebrate fossils, and added 132 specimens to his series of fossil plants. From the U.S. Geological Survey was received a series of over 600 specimens of Kinderhook crinoids, corals, and mollusea, and 450 crinoids from the Burlington group in Iowa. In addition, Messrs. Schuchert and White, of the Museum and Survey, made a valuable collection representing the flora of the various Cretaceous and | Tertiary horizons of North Greenland. Other valuable materials, including an excellent Placenticeras, 22 inches in diameter, trom Dakota, were obtained either by purchase or otherwise.
The Division of Mineralogy has materially benefited during the year through the acquisition of much new material, including several new and rare species.
The Division of Physical and Chemical Geology reports the acquisition of a large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, Prussia; some large masses of a beautiful orbicular granite from Sweden; ‘fulgurites on andesite from Little Ararat in Armenia, besides a large amount of petrographic material from the U.S. Geological Survey and other sources. The Economie Series have been enriched through the acquisition of some beautiful clear masses of rock salt from Heilbron, Prussia, collected by the head curator; kaolins and clays from Germany and Saxony; an excellent series of telluride ores from the Cripple Creek district, Colorado, and other materials which need not be mentioned in detail here.
Aside from what has been accomplished in the Division of Mineralogy, but little progress has been made in the work of installing the exhibition series. This is for the reason that the erection of the new galleries in the exhibition halls of the Divisions of Paleontology and Economic Geology, was not completed in season for more than a beginning to be made. Indeed, the new cases in the paleontological halls are not yet in readiness. Moreover, for a period of several weeks the energies of

<<<Page: 72>>>

nearly every curator and those of his assistants were fully occupied in the work of preparation for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The details of this work have been the subject of a special report, and need not be repeated here.
Mr. Lucas reports that in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology a large amount of preparatory work has been done incidental to strengthening, restoring, and preparing for exhibition the skeleton of Zeuglodon. Two skulls of Oreodon, and one of Mesohippus from the Evans collection have been cleaned, a fine skull of Claosaurus and the upper portion of a magnificent Triceratops nearly prepared for exhibition, and smaller skulls and parts of skeletons wholly or partially prepared for exhibition or study. Work of this nature is extremely slow and laborious, and additional preparators are sadly needed. When it is remembered that, excepting when aided by Mr. Schuchert and others in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, the entire work of this division has thus far been carried on by Mr. Lucas, with the assistance of one clerk and one preparator, it will be recognized at once that surprising progress has been made.
The prolonged absence of Mr. Schuchert, incidental to the purchase of materials for the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, and a subsequent trip into Missouri, together with his Greenland trip earlier in the season, has necessarily greatiy retarded his work. Satisfactory progress has been made in installing the study series and in the preparation of exhibition material, though this, too, is delayed, owing to the condition of cases and exhibition halls. Practically nothing has been accomplished with the paleobotanical series. It is expected that the appointment of an assistant in charge of this collection, and the completion of the galleries and cases, will enable me to report more satisfactory progress another year. Up to this time all Museum work -done on these collections has been voluntary by members of the paleobotanical staff of the Geological Survey, or by Mr. Schuchert and his assistants, whose time was already more than occupied by the work of their own division.
In the Division of Mineralogy I-have to report satisfactory progress in the installation of the exhibition series. The Systematic Series, the collection of meteorites, and several special series are now, for the first time, satisfactorily installed, and Mr. Tassin, who has had immediate charge of the work, is entitled te much credit, not merely for his energy and industry, but as well for the taste he has manifested in the selection and display of the material.
Much work yet remains to be done in the way of supplying deficiencies and labeling, but it is not too much to say that the collections as a whole are in excellent condition.
In the Division of Physical and Chemical Geology (systematic and applied) of which the head curator has immediate charge, no progress whatever has been made with the exhibition series until within a

<<<Page: 73>>>

period of some two weeks, owing to the delay in the completion of the gallery cases and Mr. Newhall’s absence in Nashville and Omaha. The work is now progressing satisfactorily.
An immense amount of detailed work has been accomplished in overhauling and classifying collections stored in boxes and drawers, but much yet remains to be done.
Searcely any investigations of note have been undertaken by any of the curators, owing to the pressure of other matters and the unsatisfactory condition of the exhibition halls. The head curator was himself absent in Europe during the first five months of the year, attendant upon the meetings and excursions of the Seventh International Geological Congress, and engaged in a study of European museums. Mr. Lucas has nearly completed his work on the Fossil Bison of North America, and Messrs. Charles Schuchert and David White have made a preliminary study of the fossils collected by them in Greenland during the summer of 1897. Their results are now in press.
With the exception of the collections made by Messrs. Schuchert and White in Greenland and the necessarily limited amount of material brought back by the head curator from Russia, scarcely anything has been done toward the enrichment of the collections through the direct efforts of Museum officials. The collections made by the U.S. Geological Survey and obtained by gift, purchase, and exchange have been already referred to.
The usual custom of loaning collections for study has been adhered to. Two small lots of vertebrate materials were loaned during the year, the one to Prof. H. L. Osborn, of New York, and the other to Dr. C. Rh. Eastman, of Cambridge. Dr. J. F. Whiteaves, of Ottawa, Canada, was in like manner loaned a collection of Hamilton fossils, and Dr, © George H. Girty, of the U.S. Geological Survey, has had the loan of a collection of English Carboniferous pelecypods for comparison with American species. A collection of thin sections of roofing slates was loaned Prof. T. Nelson Dale, of Williamstown, Massachusetts, and the U.S. Geological Survey has on sundry occasions been granted the usual courtesies.
The condition of the laboratories and exhibition halls has been such as to afford little encouragement to students and investigators. Prof. O. P. Hay has studied the large Cretaceous fishes from Kansas, with a view to deciding certain points in the structure of the skull and vertebral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the genus Portheus is synonymous with Xiphactinas. Several new points on the structure and affinities were ascertained and the conclusion reached that Xiphactinas Leidy, was identical with Portheus Cope. Similar results were reached independently by Alban Stewart, of Lawrence, Kansas. Prof. Henry I. Osborn has likewise studied the type of such species of Coryphodon as are represented in the collections.
Aside from the studies of members of the U.S. Geological Survey,

<<<Page: 74>>>

no investigations of note have been carried on in the Museum by other than its officers, either in the sections of Invertebrate Paleontology or Paleobotany. In the Division of Physical and Chemical Geology, Mr. Thomas L. Watson, now of the State survey of Georgia, and Dr. EK. C. E. Lord have each spent several months, the one conducting investigations relative to the weathering of basic eruptive rocks and the other working on the rocks collected by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns along the line of the Mexican Boundary Survey, and a series of eruptive rocks from Casco Bay, Maine.
The reasons already enumerated have necessarily cut down the number of papers that might otherwise have been published by the curators, Such as have appeared are sufficiently noted in the Bibliography.
The rapid accumulation of materials, and particularly large materials like vertebrate fossils, bids fair to tax to the utmost our resources for handling, preparation, and proper care. When it is recalled that the preparation of a single skull may require the services of a skilled preparator for months, it will be seen at once that our present force is quite inadequate. Moreover, work and storage rooms are pitifully cramped. When further, one recalls the strikingly interesting character of the display that is possible with this class of material, as well as its great value from a purely scientific standpoint, the desirability of pushing the work with all possible vigor becomes at once apparent, and I feel that I can not too strongly urge the granting of additional funds for the purpose.
The work of rearranging the collections in physical geology, involying the actual moving of upward of 100,000 specimens, labeling, numbering, and bringing the card catalogue up to date, will consume a very large portion of the coming year.
The same may be said regarding work in the sections of Invertebrate Paleontology and Paleobotany. There are at present not far from 1,000 boxes of fossil materials of all kinds in storage, which must
be overhauled, identified, duplicates assorted for exchange and distribution, worthless portions rejected, and the remainder made available for study and exhibition.
The amount of detailed labor essential to the proper care of the collections can be appreciated only by those who have had experience. This applies to other departments than my own.
Notwithstanding the fact that we are for the time being overburdened with materials, no opportunity should be lost for securing more, even though the same may remain years in storage. It is too much to expect that the present favorable conditions for collecting will always’ exist. Hyery reported discovery of interesting material, by members of the U. S. Geological Survey, or other parties, should be investigated, and where the character of the material warrants, immediate Steps should be taken toward its procurement by purchase or otherwise. It must be borne always in mind that delays in these matters

<<<Page: 75>>>

result disastrously. This is particularly true regarding vertebrate remains which, once exposed, become quickly ruined, unless promptly and properly cared for, and inexperienced collectors often do more harm than good. Moreover, other institutions, both American and foreign, are ever on the alert to obtain that to which we naturally feel the National Museum is best entitled.
I can not refrain, in conclusion, from stating that too much praise can scarcely be awarded the individual curators and their assistants for the untiring energy and patience manifested, and their willingness always to lay aside individual desires and preferences for the welfare of the department as a whole. But for this, the work of the head curator would be disheartening in the extreme.

<<<Page: 76>>>

On July 1,1897, Mr. W. H. Holmes, Dr. Frederick W. True, and Dr. George P. Merrill were appointed head curators of the newly organized departments of Anthropology, Biology, and Geology, respectively. Mr. W. H. Holmes, who had been connected with the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, assumed his duties at the National Museum on October 1.
Mr. William H. Ashmead, of the Department of Agriculture, was appointed assistant curator of the Division of Insects in the National Museum on July 1, and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., was given a temporary appointment as assistant curator of the Division of Mammals.
Dr. W. L. Ralph, of Utica, New York, was made honorary custodian of the Section of Birds’ Eggs on November 12.
Mr. W. T. Swingle and Mr. D. G. Fairchild, both of the Department of Agriculture, were appointed custodians of the Sections of Algwe and Lower Fungi, respectively, in the Division of Plants. These appointments took effect December 7.
Dr. Harrison G. Dyar was appointed custodian of the Section of Lepidoptera, Division of Insects, on November 12.
On April 30 Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was appointed a collaborator in the Division of Ethnology.
Dr. F. W. True was appointed Representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum for the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition (Omaha), and Mr. M. V. Cox, chief special agent.
In the absence of Mr. W. V. Cox, Mr. J. L. Willige continued to act as chief clerk.
A complete list of the members of the scientific and administrative staff is given in Appendix I.
The amount appropriated for the National Museum for the current fiscal year was $233,000. The total expenditures under this appropriation aggregated $227,473.54, leaving a gross balance of $5,526.46. From the appropriations for the previous fiscal year expenditures to the amount of $10,492.95 were made, leaving a balance (subject to liabilities) of $391.76.

<<<Page: 77>>>

The appropriations for the fiscal year just ended were $25,275 in excess of those for the preceding year, there being an increase of $6,775 in the amount appropriated for the preservation of collections, an increase of $1,000 for heating and lighting, an increase of $15,000 in the amount allotted for furniture and fixtures (to be used for the construction of cases, etc., for the new galleries), and an appropriation of $2,500 for removing and rebuilding storage sheds. It may be remarked that the amount allotted for the preservation of collections fell short of the estimate to the extent of $20,000, and that the appropriation for heating and lighting was $1,000 below the estimate; also that the sum asked for to be used in repairs to buildings was cut down one-half, the amount provided being only $4,000. The sum of $18,000 was requested for printing and binding, but only $12,000 was appropriated.

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Lea.
The following statement concerning the estimates for appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, is quoted from the report of the acting chief clerk, Mr. J. L. Willige:
In October estimates were prepared of the appropriations required for the maintenance of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899. In addition to the regular appropriations for furniture and fixtures, heating and lighting, preservation and increase of collections, building repairs, rent of workshops, postage, and printing and binding, the following special appropriations were requested: For illustrations for Museum publications, $5,000; for the purchase of books, pamphlets, and periodicals for reference, $2,000; for the continuation of the construction of galleries in the Museum building, the building of skylights in the four courts, and the erection of a ventilator upon the roof of the lecture hall, $10,000; for the erection of a fireproof building for workshop and storage purposes, $50,000; for the purchase of the herbarium of the late M. 8S. Bebb, of Rockford, Illinois, $5,000; for the purchase of the library of the late G. Brown Goode, $5,000.
“ An increase of $20,000 was requested in the estimates for the coming fiscal year for the preservation, exhibition, and increase of the Museum collections. The importance of the grant of this additional sum for the purpose of developing the Department of Geology and expanding it in the direction of a museum of practical geology and to enable substantial increases to be made in the compensation of the higher grades of assistants in the Museum was strongly urged upon Congress.
The latest conference report on the sundry civil bill states the item at $165,000, an increase of $5,000 over the appropriation for 1898.
In the estimates for appropriations for the coming fiscal year is an item of $15,000 for heating and lighting, being $1,000 in excess of the current appropriation.
In view of the considerable sum of money paid from year to year by the Museum for the preparation of drawings for use in the Museum publications, it was endeavored to have a specific appropriation of $5.000 provided for the purpose. It was explained that this item of expenditure is an important one in carrying out the policy of disseminating information regarding the Government collections among educational institutions throughout the country, and the hope expressed that it would not be necessary to continue the cost of illustrations as a charge upon the appropriation for the preservation, exhibition, and increase of the Museum collections. The sundry civil bill, while not, however, containing a specific appropriation for drawings, authorizes the expenditure for this purpose, from the preservation of collections appropriation, of a sum not exceeding $5,500.
In the estimates submitted to Congress for the coming fiscal year is an item of $17,000 for printing the Bulletins and Proceedings and labels and blanks for the National Museum, and binding books and pamphlets for the Museum library. It is urged that the entire sum asked be appropriated, in order that an edition of the Museum publications large enough to supply the principal scientific and educational establishments may be assured.

In the acts of Congress approved June 11, 1896, and June 4, 1897, provision was made for the erection of iron galleries in the Museum building. Under these appropriations, amounting altogether to $16,000, galleries have been erected in the four courts and in three of the halls of the building, thus increasing the exhibition space by 17,000 square feet. °
During the fiscal year just closed the work of constructing the galleries has been under the direction of the Superintendent of the Library of Congress.
In the estimates submitted to Congress for appropriations for the coming fiscal year the sum of $10,000 was asked for, to be used in erecting galleries connecting the courts with the adjoining halls, supplying railings, painting the ironwork about the galleries, and placing skylights above the courts. This item is included in the sundry civil bill as passed by both Houses of Congress and sent to the President for approval.
It was requested in the estimates for 1898-99 that provision be made for the construction of a special building adapted for workshops and for storage purposes. A preliminary plan for a building 50 feet front by 130 feet deep, to be entirely fireproof in its construction and corresponding in its materials and workmanship with the Museum building, was prepared and submitted. The cost of the proposed building was estimated at $50,000. The Government reservation between the National and Army Medical museums, with frontage on B street south, was suggested as an advantageous site for the building. The proposition was not favorably acted upon by Congress, but, in addition to the $2,000 customarily granted for the rental of a building for storage purposes, the sum of $2,500 was appropriated for the rental of additional quarters in which to place the carpenter and cabinet shops and for the storage of the material contained in the wooden shops near the Fish Commission building.
The storage sheds south of the Smithsonian buildings were removed during the year. They had long been regarded as a source of danger to the main building in case of fire. Some sections of the sheds were removed to the yard of the storage building on Ninth street. The remaining serviceable material was used in the erection of a two-story workshop.
The wooden floors in two of the ranges were taken up and substantial concrete floors laid in their stead. Mahogany wall cases and

<<<Page: 80>>>

screens have been constructed and placed in position on several of the galleries.
In order to accommodate additional floor cases, the steam radiators in some of the exhibition halls have been raised to a convenient height and attached to the piers. Improvements in the water-supply system have also been made.
The walls in many of the halls and ranges and in two of the courts were painted during the year.
The amount of material received during the year was unusually large, aggregating 457,096 specimens. These were embraced in 1,441 separate accession lots. In the division of insects alone 226,000 specimens were received, due to the acquisition of the Hubbard and Schwarz collection, which is specially referred to elsewhere. Large quantities of material were received by the Division of Mollusks and the Division of Paleontology, and there have been notable increases in the colleetions of the divisions of prehistoric archeology, mammals, birds, and plants. The following tables show the number of specimens added to the various collections during the year and the total number of specimens in each collection on June 30, 1898:

During the year, 25,405 packages were received by the Registrar. Of this number, 690 contained specimens for the Museum collections (an increase of 79 over the record for the previous year), 1,724 contained supplies of various kinds for use in the offices and shops of the Museum, and 11,522 consisted of publications. Three thousand and seventythree packages were sent out.
The entries on the outgoing transportation record numbered 1,482 and on the incoming transportation record 3,137.
Seven carloads of material were shipped to the TransMississippi and International Exposition at Omaha.
Two hundred and twenty-one packages were placed in storage and 57 were withdrawn.
Thirty-two thousand three hundred and sixty-three specimens were sent out as gifts or in exchange, and 7,461 specimens were lent for study during the year. A number of sets of marine invertebrates have been prepared with a special view to supplying the needs of schools, and these have been distributed to the number of about 17,000 Specimens. Many collections of rocks and ores and casts of prehistoric implements were also presented to educational establishments.
A complete list of the distributions of the year is printed in Appendix 11.

Several exchanges have been conducted with institutions and individuals in foreign countries, resulting in the acquisition of some valuable material.
It is questionable whether this branch of the Museum work is, taken as a whole year by year, very profitable. It is difficult to arrange satisfactorily the details of an exchange with an establishment several thousands of milesaway. Thenecessity of determining one uncertain point may cause a delay of several months, during which time other opportunities for utilizing the material intended for exchange may have arisen. Valuations placed on specimens vary, and what may seem to us a generous offer on our part may be regarded as far from being an equivalent to the other party. In certain cases it is impossible to furnish first class specimens, and the failure to do so, although explanation nay have been made in the correspondence leading to the exchange, has not unfrequently placed this Museum in an undesirable and undeserved position. Furthermore, it seldom happens that the-establishment with which an exchange is being conducted is willing to part with its best material, especially if sending first. Specimens which

<<<Page: 84>>>

REPORT OF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY. o were in good condition when shipped often deteriorate before reaching their destination, and this again furnishes ground for dissatisfaction.
It is not likely, however, that transactions with establishments and individuals who have been exchanging material with this Museum, to the satisfaction of both, will be discontinued, although it is doubtful whether special pains will be taken to extend negotiations of this character into untried fields.
A number of exchanges which have been pending for special reasons were completed during the year just closed. Among the mostimportant transactions the following may be mentioned :
From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria, 66 specimens of Tertiary corals were received in exchange for Lower Cretaceous fossils. The Paleontological Museum of the Royal Academy, Munich, Bavaria, received from the U. S. National Museum 16 specimens of Cambrian fossils, in exchange for material sent some time ago. Thirty-three specimens of fossil plants, representing 20 species, were received from the Natural History Society of New Brunswick, St. John, and 90 specimens of fossil plants have been sent in return. The Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia, has received 170 bird skins from the National Museum, in continuation of exchanges. Land shells from Transcaspia and the Caucasus and marine shells from the coast of Russia have been received from the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, in exchange for about 2,000 specimens of shells from the National Museum. Mons. M. Cossmann, Paris, France, sent a collection of shells in exchange for publications. Sixty-two specimens of Actinians have been transmitted to the Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, in exchange for material yet to be forwarded. Crustaceans have been sent to the Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland, in return for specimens already received and in continuation of exchanges.
Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey, was authorized to arrange exchanges with several foreign museums during his visit to Europe in the summer of 1897. He made an especial effort to obtain corals from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of Europe. Series of specimens have already been received from the GeologicalPaleontological Institute, Munich, Bavaria, and the Geological Society of London; also from the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, as stated above.
Ninety-eight requisitions were received from the various divisions of the Museum during the year. Twelve of these were sent to the Government Printing Office to be filled, namely, requisitions for binding 482 books; for printing 3,958 labels, representing 197 forms, for printing 700 specifications for supplies; for binding 13 volumes of vouchers; for 500 manila pads, and 9 record books. There were printed at the Museum 209,205 labels (representing 6,640 forms), of which 48,998 (representing 3,902 forms) were for use in connection with the Trans

<<<Page: 85>>>

Mississippi and International Exposition. More than 160,000 letter heads, envelopes, circulars, blanks, etc., representing 68 forms, were also printed.
There were 276,527 visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum buildings during the year. The following tables show respectively the number of visitors during each month of the fiscal year just closed, and the total number during each year since the Museum building was opened

During the year covered by this report the following persons have been accorded access to the collections in the Museum:
Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agriculture, has spent much time in the study of Eskimo collections and has completed a monograph on the subject. Mr. P. C. Boyle, of Oil City, Pennsylvania, studied the collection of lamps and illuminating devices. Mr. Stewart Culin, Director of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, University of Pennsylvania, has had access to the collections of games in connection with the preparation of a paper. Mr. J. D. MeGuire, of Ellicott City, Maryland, has continued his work upon the pipes of the American aborigines. The results of his investigations have been embodied in a paper which will appear in the Report of the Museum for 1897 (now in press). Major J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, examined the pipes collected by himself in Utah many years ago. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes has prosecuted investigations upon the material which he recently collected in the Southwest, and has prepared a report upon his explorations during 1897-98. In the Division of Historic Archwelogy information has been given to the following: Mr. Richard Fisher, San Antonio, Texas; Mr. F. W. Hodge, Bureau of Ethnology; Hon. Oscar Straus, Mr. George W. Moon, London, England; and Prof. H. Hyvernat, of the Catholic University, Washington.
Prof. James Hine, of the Ohio State University, consulted the Museum collection of Neuroptera. Mr. Arthur C. Bradley, of Newport, New Hampshire, examined the Noctuide for the purpose of identifying specimens collected in New Hampshire. Mr. Nathan Banks, of the Department of Agriculture, has frequently examined the Arachnida and allied classes for purposes of study and identification. Prof. Roland Thaxter, of Harvard University, spent several days during March examining the collection of Coleoptera for minute fungi found growing on their elytra. He secured some very rare species from the exotic beetles. Professor Thaxter is engaged in monographing this group of fungi (the Laboulbeniacex). Mrs. Annie T. Slosson and Doctor Prime, of Franconia, New Hampshire; Mr. O. W. Barrett, of Clarendon, Vermont; Dr. J. W. Holland, of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; Dr. H. G. Griffith and Mr. William J. Fox, of Philadelphia; Prof. F. M. Webster, of Wooster, Ohio; and many others have consulted the collections in the Division of Insects during the year.
Mr. EK. W. Nelson, Department of Agriculture, spent three months or more studying the Museum collection of Mexican birds in connection with the determination of the material collected by him in Mexico for the Biological Survey. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, Department of Agriculture, studied the Horned Larks, with a view to revising the group; the forms of Thryothorus bewicki, with a view to the prep

aration of a revision of the group; the series of Amazilia cerviniventris, in order to determine the distribution of a new form; the series of Megascops flammeolus, for the purpose of determining the forms embraced under that name; also two small collections of birds from West Africa. Dr. A. K. Fisher, Department of Agriculture, examined the collection at various times in connection with his determination of certain type specimens and the identification of material for the Bio. logical Survey. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachusetts, made use of the Museum collection in identifying a series of 700 birds from the Santa Marta region of Colombia. Mr. J. W. Garrett, of Baltimore, Maryland, consulted the library preparatory to identifying a collection of Patagonian birds. Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, studied the petrels, in order to determine the validity of a Pacific coast form. Mrs. George C. Maynard and Miss Florence Merriam, both of Washington, examined certain North American birds, for the purpose of describing them in popular works on birds.
Miss Jennie EK. Letson, of Buffalo, New York, devoted considerable time to the study of mollusks. Mr. Outram Bangs spent a few days in March, and again in May, making comparisons of North American species of mammals. Professor Mitsukuri, of the University of Tokyo, studied the collection of seals, in order to familiarize himself with their taxonomic character. Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agriculture, was given facilities for an extended study of the squirrels of Mexico and Central America. Mr. George R. Wieland, State College, Pennsylvania; examined specimens of marine and fresh-water turtles. Dr. David S. Jordan, president of the Leland Stanford Junior University, examined fishes in connection with a report upon the investigations of the Fur Seal Commission, and in connection also with the preparation of additional volumes of the work on the “Fishes of North and Middle America.”! Dr. B. W. Evermann, who is associated with Doctor Jordan as joint author of the above work, also made frequent use of the collections. Dr. H. M.Smith and Dr. W. C. Kendall, ot the U.S. Fish Commission, compared specimens of fishes in the collection with others recently obtained by the Commission.
Miss Harriet Richardson made a study of certain groups of Isopoda, including species of the genera Rocinela and Afga, and is preparing an annotated list of the Isopoda of the west coast of North America. In November Prof. K. Mitsukuri, of the University of Tokyo, spent about a week at the Museum studying the Holothuroidea obtained during the cruise of the Albatross to the Galapagos Islands in 1891. In February, Mr. K. Kishinouye, of Tokyo, was engaged for two weeks in studying the Medusxe and the Penidi. Since early in May Dr. Charles M. Blackford, jr., of the Medical College of Georgia, has been engaged in studying the Protozoa and other low forms of life.

City, spent a few days at the Herbarium in individual work on the Asclepiadacez, which she is engaged in monographing. Dr. John K. Small, curator of the Herbarium of Columbia University, New York City, consulted the Herbariuin frequently during a short visit to Washington in August, and in connection with his work he greatly assisted the Museum by making a number of critical determinations. Mr. C. H. Thompson, of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, St. Louis, was engaged for a few days in the study of Lemnacee. Prof. L. M. Underwood, Columbia University, New York, visited the Herbarium in November and studied the Pteridophyta. Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University, Washington, frequently consulted the collection. He has made many valuable suggestions, and has generously placed his library at the disposal of members of the Museum staff. Through the opportunity thus afforded of studying certain works not to be found elsewhere in the city, the members of the staff have been materially aided in certain lines of investigation. Mr. William Canby, of Wilmington, Delaware, made several visits to the Herbarium, and has contributed some valuable plants. Mr. Canby has long been a correspondent of the Museum, and has added many rare plants to the collection. Mr. Hermann von Schrenk, of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, spent a short time at the Herbarium in June. Prof. F. A. Waugh, of the University of Vermont, examined certain specimens. Professor Ruth of the -University of Tennessee inspected the arrangements in the Herbarium.
In the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology many visitors have requested the privilege of examining specimens, and their wishes have been acceded to whenever practicable. Dr. E.C. E. Lord, of the U.S, Geological Survey, and Dr. Thomas L. Watson, of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, studied the collections in the Division of Geology. Prof. O. P. Hay has examined the large Cretaceous fishes from KanSas with a view to deciding certain points in the structure of the Skull and vertebral column, and also to ascertain whether or not the genus Portheus is synonymous with Viphactinas. Several new points in the structure and affinities of Viphactinas were ascertained and the conclusion reached that Viphactinas Leidy was identical with Portheus Cope, the latter name being a synonym. Prof. Henry F. Osborn studied the types of such species of Coryphodon as are contained in the collections, with the intention of making a revision of the species of that genus.
On January 7, 1898, Miss Mary Bartlett Smith was given permission to serve as volunteer assistant in the Division of Marine Invertebratés.
The privilege granted to visitors to the Smithsonian and Museum buildings of photographing and sketching objects in the exhibition halls has been availed of by a large number of persons. Many classes from the public and private schools of Washington visited the Museum

<<<Page: 89>>>

during the year, and pupils from a number of schools outside of Washington also inspected the collections.
It may be stated here that permission can not be granted to photograph objects on deposit and not the property of the Museum, until the written consent of the owners has been obtained, nor can prints from Museum negatives be furnished in such cases without the consent of the owners.
Material has been sent out for examination as follows:

Mr. Whiteaves is monographing the species of this locality. Some molars of Coryphodon were sent to Prof, Henry L. Osborn to aid in his revision of the species of the

<<<Page: 92>>>

genus, and plates of Dinichthys pustulosus were lent to Dr. C. RK. Eastman of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. English Carboniferous pelecypods were sent to Dr. G. H. Girty of the U.S. Geological Survey. A collection of thin sections of slates was lent to Prof. T. Nelson Dale, Williamstown, Mass.
In the foregoing paragraphs allusion is made only to specimens sent in response to special applications. In addition, a large number of sets of marine invertebrates, minerals, rocks and ores, etc., have been distributed among educational establishments desiring such material both for study and exhibition. In this connection it may be stated that very few of these collections are left, and unless special provision be soon made by Congress which will enabie the Museum to engage the services of competent assistants to select the duplicate specimens from the various collections and make them up into sets, that branch of Museum work will have to be practically suspended. It is quite impossible for the present force of assistants in the scientific divisions to leave their regular duties for special work of this character, which, while very desirable and intended to be helpful to other museums, colleges, ete., has in it no element of gain whatever to the National Museum.
The cooperation of the various Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government has continued during the year, and has resulted, as usual, in the addition to the collections of valuable and interesting material. This is especially so in the case of the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Fish Commission, and the Department of Agriculture. The Museum not only benefits largely by the law providing that all Government collections shall be turned over to it after they have served the purpose for which they were obtained, but it also profits materially by the hearty cooperation and courtesy so frequently manifested by Government officials. A statement of the material transmitted by the various Departments will be found in the Accession List (Appendix Ir). The collections of particular interest are also referred to by the head curators in their annual reports.
Especial mention should be made of the valuable services rendered without remuneration by many of the members of the scientific staff of the Museum. There are now thirteen curators, one assistant curator, and fifteen custodians who serve the Museum without pay. The majority of these are in the employ of other Departments or Bureaus of the Government, but have willingly given to the Museum such time and attention as could be spared from their regular official duties. There are also two collaborators, three associates in zoology, and one in paleontology who are attached to the staff in an honorary capacity.

<<<Page: 93>>>

During the year 576 “lots” of specimens (Nos. 4494-5069, inclusive) were received for examination from individuals and educational establishments in various sections of the country. Of this material the percentage which has been of sufficient interest for addition to the Museum collections is very small. This branch of the work yields little or no profit to the Museum, since the senders of valuable material almost invariably request its return. Moreover, the condition in which material is received is frequently a source of delay in securing prompt determinations. In many instances the specimens are almost entirely destroyed during transmittal, owing to insufficient packing.
Pamphlets describing the manner in which specimens of various kinds may best be collected and prepared for shipment have been widely distributed, and it is hoped that persons desiring to avail themselves of the facilities which the Museum affords in the identification of specimens will comply with the suggestions which they contain.
Technical information on various subjects has been furnished to a large number of correspondents during the year, and drawings or blue prints of Museum cases have been transmitted to those who have applied for them. There is hardly a day when from thirty to forty letters are not written in response to communications received from persons seeking definite knowledge of some kind.
The Annual Report of the Museum for 1895 has been published, and the papers in the Appendix have also appeared in separate form. The Report for 1896 is now in type, with the exception of the index, and the proof reading of the administrative portion of the volume for 1897 has been completed.
Volume xix of the Proceedings has been published. Most of the papers in this volume were issued in separate form during the preceding fiscal year. The last four, however, were published since July 1, 1897. Papers 1124-1139, inclusive, constituting Volume xXx, have appeared.
The titles of all papers which have been published in separate form, during the year are given in Appendix v.
The text of Bulletin 47 is now all in type, with the exception of the “addenda.” The work, when completed, will consist of three volumes and an atlas.
Another of the series of pamphlets containing directions for collecting and preserving natural history specimens has been issued.’ This paper is by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, and contains instructions for the collection of scale insects. Circular 48, which has also been published,
1 Bulletin 39, Part L.

<<<Page: 94>>>

relates to collecting and preserving the bones and teeth of specimens of Mastodon and Mammoth.
The titles of a large number of papers published during the year by officers of the Museum and other investigators are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Many of these papers appeared in publications other than those of the Museum. The number of authors represented is 83, and the total number of papers mentioned, 234. The subjects treated upon are indicated in the following tabie:

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in an order dated March 19, 1898, placed 5,800 copies of the Museum Report at the disposal of the Museum, retaining 1,200 copies, out of the edition of 7,000 allotted to both establishments, for distribution by the Institution itself. This increase enables the Museum to supply a large number of public libraries and schools which had not heretofore received the volume.
In the last Annual Report mention was made of an arrangement by which members of the scientific staff might, with the approval of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, print papers based upon Museum material in publications other than those of the Museum. During the year perinission has been given to publish sixteen papers in this way. The names of the authors are as follows: James E.

<<<Page: 95>>>

Benedict, Miss M. J. Rathbun, J. N. Rose, Gerrit 8. Miller, jr., Walter Hough, Robert Ridgway, David White, Charles Schuchert, and Miss Harriet Richardson. The titles of those papers which have been published within the fiscal year will be found in the Bibliography (Appendix IV).
The librarian, Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions for the year were as follows: Books, 848; pamphlets, 1,945; parts of periodicals, 16,746; total, 19,539. These figures include the publications retained trom the accessions to the library of the Smithsonian Institution, which were as follows: Books, 407; pamphlets, 1,148; parts of periodicals, 11,817. One thousand books belonging to the Smithsonian deposit and 409 belonging to the Museum were bound.
More than 10,000 books were borrowed during the year, a considerable proportion of these being assigned to sectional libraries. About 17,000 books were consulted in the library.
The work of transferring titles to the new catalogue is progressing.
Two new sectional libraries have been organized during the year— Technology and Stratigraphic Paleontology. There are now twentythree authorized sectional libraries, as follows:
Administration, Mesozoic fossils, Birds, Mineralogy, Botany, Mollusks, Comparative anatomy, Oriental antiquities, Ethnology, Paleobotany, Fishes, Parasites, Geology, Photography, History, Prehistoric archeology, Insects, Reptiles, Mammals, Stratigraphic paleontology, Marine invertebrates, Technology. Medicine, EXPLORATIONS.
A quantity of valuable material has come into the possession of the Museum through explorations conducted by members of the Museum staff, by other individuals, and by various bureaus of the Government.
Dr. W. L. Abbott has sent in large collections of birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, and other animals collected by himself in lower Siam and Kashmir, thus very materially adding to the valuable series of specimens which have been received from him in past years.
Prof. Dean C. Worcester, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed a large series of bird skins, eggs, and nests collected in the Philippine Islands.
An interesting series of bird skins collected in Santa Marta, Colombia, was received from Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Massachusetts.
The Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Fish Commission, and other Governmental bureaus have continued to

<<<Page: 96>>>

send in valuable collections obtained by their representatives in the field.
A large lot of invertebrates collected by the naturalists of the steamer Albatross in recent years on the coasts of California, Japan, and Kamchatka and in the Bering Sea should receive special notice.
A large series of land shells collected in Mexico by the Biological Survey constitutes an addition of more than ordinary value.
The expedition made by Mr. R. P. Currie in the neighborhood of Mount Coffee, Liberia, West Africa, under the auspices of the Museum and with the valuable assistance of Prof. O. F. Cook, of the Colonization Society, resulted in the acquisition of a large number of insects, spiders, and myriapods, numbering in all about 5,000 specimens, and some valuable reptiles, birds, and mammals. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, while pursuing investigations on the Commander Islands as a member of the Fur Seal Commission, collected birds, insects and other animals for the Museum. Of the insects 28 were found to represent new species and others were very rare. Mr. Robert Ridgway made an exploration for the Museum in the vicinity of Lake Okechobee, Florida, and obtained a considerable number of rare birds.
Mr. J. N. Rose was engaged for four months in the summer and fall of 1897 in making a botanical collection in western and central Mexico. He visited a little known part of the country and succeeded in bringing back a large and valuable collection of plants. The collection includes more than 6,000 specimens and contains more than 100 species new to science. Mr. Rose also succeeded in obtaining some interesting ethnological specimens, including spinners, reels, etc., used by the natives in converting cotton and Agave fiber into thread, strings, and rope. This collection also includes native cups, spoons, mats, hats, ropes, ete. In each case botanical specimens were obtained which show definitely the origin of the products.
Karly in March an opportunity was presented for a botanist to acecompany an expedition to the Keys of south Florida, undertaken by Messrs. E. L. Morris and G, N, Collins for the purpose of making general scientific collections. Mr. Pollard was authorized by the Acting Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum to accompany the expedition, leave of absence for two months on full pay being granted him on condition that the Museum receive a set of the botanical specimens obtained, and that it should not assume payment of transportation or other expenses. On March 4 Mr. Pollard proceeded directly with his companions to Key West; the party there engaged a boat and made a complete circuit of the Keys, reaching Miami, on the coast of Florida, April 5. After a week spent at the latter place, the expedition returned by steamer to Key West and thence to Washington. About 250 species of plants were obtained. These have since been determined by Mr. Pollard and will form the subject-matter of a report to be presented for publication at an early date.

<<<Page: 97>>>

Dr. F. W. True and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., obtained natural history material, including about 80 specimens of reptiles and batrachians in Maine.
Dr. George P. Merrill, during his visit to Russia in the summer of 1897, collected some interesting geological material.
Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, accompanied an expedition under the direction of Lieutenant Peary, U. S. N., in July, for the purpose of gathering fossils and other natural history material in the region of Noursoak Peninsula, Greenland, and with a view especially to obtaining specimens from the vicinity of Disko Island, to serve as a basis of comparison with related material gathered from the Cretaceous of the United States. Mr. David White, of the U. 8. Geological Survey, accom panied Mr, Schuchert. A large collection of Cretaceous and Tertiary plants was secured; also some interesting specimens of fishes and mollusks.
About 1,300 specimens of pottery and other relics from the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona, have been received from Dr. J. W. Fewkes as a further result of his explorations in that region. Dr. Walter Hough, assistant curator of the Division of Ethnology, accompanied Dr. Fewkes in the summer of 1897.
A number of unique ethnological specimens obtained by Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia were received from the Bureau of Ethnology.
Material of great value obtained by the exploring parties of the Bureau of Ethnology has also been received.
Collectors’ outfits —Outfits have been furnished to the following persons, who have undertaken to collect material for the National Museum: Mr. Edward J. Brown, Lemon City, Florida; Mr. John G. Webb, Osprey, Florida; Rev. D. W. Snyder, for collecting in Africa; Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. 8. A., Fort Clark, Texas; Hon. J. D. Mitchell, Victoria, Texas; Prof. A. E. Verrill, Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut; Mr. George D. Wilder, Pekin, China; Mr. J. A. Loring, Owego, New York, for collecting in European countries; Mr. J. S. Holmes, Bowman’s Bluff, Henderson County, North Carolina.
Several members of the Museum staff have also been furnished with collecting outfits, as follows: Mr. Charles Schuchert, Mr. David White, Doctor F. W. True, Miss M. J. Rathbun, Mr. William Palmer, Dr. Walter Hough, aud Mr. Robert Ridgway.
In addition to the colleeting trips undertaken by members of the Museum staff, several of the curators and assistants were absent from time to time during the year on other business pertaining to the . Museum. Some were temporarily in the employ of other departments or bureaus of the Government. ;
Thus Mr. F. A. Lucas was absent for several months during 1897, having been detailed by the President to visit Alaska as a member of the Fur Seal Commission. Dr. Stejneger was also a member of this

<<<Page: 98>>>

Commission. Mr. Barton A. Bean, assistant curator of fishes, was placed on detached service, with instructions to report on July 4 to the U. S. Fish Commission, to accompany in the capacity of temporary field assistant, a party sent out by the Commission for the purpose of conducting an examination of the fish fauna of the group of lakes lying east of the Klamath Lakes in southern Oregon. All necessary expenses in connection with Mr. Bean’s trip were defrayed by the Commission. Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, was requested, in connection with his duties as Commissioner from the Government of the United States to the International Exposition held at Brussels, Belgium, in 1897, to avail himself of the opportunities offered by his stay in Brussels to make excursions to points of archiological interest within convenient reach of the Belgian capital, and to visit especially the newer anthropological museums of Belgium and Holland. He was directed to give particular attention to collecting information concerning the buildings occupied by these museums, the interior arrangements (exhibition halls, laboratories, storage facilities, ete.), and their methods of preparing, labeling, and installing specimens. He was also authorized to attend, as delegate from the Institution and Museum, any congresses or other scientific meetings relating to anthropology held in Brussels during the exposition.
In September Mr. J. E. Watkins, chief of buildings and superintendence, proceeded to New York City for the purpose of examining the exhibition cases in the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Prof. O. T. Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, visited Chicago in November for the purpose of examining the collections in the Field Columbian Museum.
On December 22 Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology, was directed to proceed to Waynesville, Ohio, for the purpose of representing the interests of the National Museum in the matter of shipping to Washington the collection of fossils and other specimens bequeathed to the Museum by the late Mr. I. H. Harris.
On February 25, 1898, Mr. Schuchert visited localities in New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, lowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Kentucky for the purpose of inspecting fossils in the hands of private collectors, with a view to completing the series to be exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. He was directed to report upon the collections examined and make recommendations for the purchase of desirable material.
On April 16 Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, curator of the Division of Reptiles and Batrachians, proceeded to Philadelphia to examine collections at the residence of the late Prof. E. D. Cope, with a view to identifying specimens belonging to the Government but which had been temporarily in Professor Cope’s hands for study. He was requested at the same time to avail himself of the opportunity offered by his presence in

<<<Page: 99>>>

Philadelphia to visit the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences for the purpose of arranging for the transmission to Washington of specimens belonging to the National Museum. Dr. A. C. Peale was also detailed to assist in this work.
On May 1 Dr. Stejneger left Washington for the purpose of visiting England and the continent of Europe, at his own expense, with a view to examining, in certain European museums, types of American species of reptiles and batrachians, and specimens of the birds and reptiles of Japan andof the north Pacific coast and adjacentislands. Dr. Stejneger attended the International Fisheries Exposition, which opened at Bergen, Norway, on May 16, with the expectation also of attending the Fourth International Zoological Congress, which convenes at Cambridge, England, on August 23. He was especially requested to secure information concerning new museum methods in northern Europe.
Mr. I’. A. Lucas, acting assistant curator of Vertebrate Fossils, journeyed to New Haven on May 4 to receive from Prof. O. C. Marsh a number of fossil vertebrates for the Museum collection.
Seventy-three mammals were received and skinned during the year. A considerable proportion of these came from the National Zoological Park, as shown in the following table:

In addition, 35 other specimens were received and immediately turned over to other departments of the Museum.
Two large crocodiles were received from the Zoological Park. One of these was skinned and preserved for mounting. A skin of an elk was made up for the study series; also the skin of a kangaroo, the skeleton being taken out entire in each instance.
Sixty-eight skins were received, as follows:

A specimen of Bassaricyon gabbii was mounted.
Several hundred large skins, both dry and in pickle, are on hand. A large number of skulls of mammals were cleaned.
Improvements were made in the groups exhibited in the mammal hallas follows: The two caribou groups were overhauled and renovated, as were also the African monkey group and the sea-otter group. A large number of single specimens were cleaned. A group of humming birds was designed and arranged for the Division of Birds, and a large number of minor matters received attention.
Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, was in Nashville for nearly a month, engaged in repacking portions of the exhibit sent by the Museum to the Tennessee Centennial Exposition. Considerable work was also done by Mr. Palmer in connection with the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition at Omaha. The taxidermists’ shop was removed to new quarters during the year.
In the Division of Birds the taxidermists have cleaned and renovated about 2,500 specimens, and have mounted or remounted a number of others, a portion of them being intended for exhibition at the TransMississippi Exposition. A collection of birds which was exhibited at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition was overhauled upon its return.
Various causes have combined to prevent satisfactory progress in osteological work during the period covered by this report. Considerable work has been accomplished, however, under adverse circumstances, as shown by the following table:

Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition.—The Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition opened at Omaha on June 1, 1898, and will continue for five months, An appropriation of $50,000 for the erection of a Government building was made by Congress, and this amount was afterwards increased to $60,000, with an additional appropriation of $2,500 for the erection of a building for an exhibit by the Life-Saving Service. The sum of $137,500 was appropriated for an exhibit by the Exeertive Departments, the Smithsonian Institution, including the National Museum, and the U.S. Fish Commission. Of this amount $19,491.71 was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus. ;
Exhibits have been prepared by each of the three scientific departmentsof the Museum—anthropology, biology, and geology. The Department of Anthropology has sent series illustrative of fire-making and illumination, exploitative industries, domestic arts, ceramic art, metal working, sculpture, photography, land and marine transportation, and the progress in certain branches of electrical engineering; groups of life-sized figures representing people engaged in primitive arts; series of weapons, tools, and musical instruments, and objects showing the history of the development of bookmaking. The exhibit of the Department of Biology includes series of the lower invertebrates, mollusks, insects, fishes, reptiles and batrachians, birds, mammals, and aquatic plants.

WAYNESVILLE, OHIO, December 29, 1897.
GENTLEMEN: In making a survey of the natural-history specimens belonging to the late Mr. I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, consisting of fossils, archeological specimens, shells, and minerals, about 15,546 specimens were found, as per appended list.

The total includes the duplicate specimens which Mr. Harris agreed should be exchanged by the U.S. National Museum whenever favorable opportunity offers.

That, being the only species, is necessarily the type, and therefore the name Scyllarus must be retained forit.”’ For the Scyllarus of Dana and modern authors the new name Scyllarides is proposed. :

By EDWARD DRINKER CopE, A. M., PH. D.,
Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the University of Pennsylvania, and Member of the U. S. National Academy of Sciences.
The scope of the present work is to give an account of the physical characteristics of the reptiles of the orders of Loricata and Squamata, which inhabit the Nearctic zoological realm, so far as they are known to the writer. That the work is far from complete I am well aware, but that it is much in advance of other works in this respect may be well admitted, as no general work of the kind has appeared since that of Holbrook, half a century ago. With my book on the Batrachia, published in 1889, and Dr. Baur’s on the Testudinata (in preparation), the access to North American herpetology becomes equal to that which the science of ornithology has long enjoyed.
The principles of classification which have been followed are those which the nature of the case requires, so far as the author has been able to discover them. One general statement may be made as an abstract proposition, and that is that the taxonomy of organic beings is a register of structural or anatomical characters from the most comprehensive to the smallest divisions. This is generally recognized in the case of the former, but there are many naturalists who fail to recognize it in the case of the more restricted divisions, and especially as applying to genera. An indefinite idea of the “ naturalness” of the collocation of species necessary to constitute genera still lingers in their minds. By this idea of a “natural” association of species, they mean a group which coincides in possessing a certain community of Species characters, as color, and color pattern, size, nature of surfaces, geographical range, etc., all of which, while of importance in their place, are quite irrelevant to the question of generic divisions. I long since pointed out that generic characters may, and in fact generally do, arise in the process of evolution quite independently of the specific, so that certain species of different genera resemble each other in the so-called “natural,” that is, specific characters, more than they do other species of their own genus. The same phenomenon is well known among higher

<<<Page: 181>>>

groups, where I have called it ‘‘ heterology;” that is, the genera of a family may parallel more or less the genera of another; or the families of one order those of another order. It is not, then, remarkable that sometimes one or more species of two or more genera should parallel each other. The reason why the aggregate of appearances is sometimes preferred to single structural differences as definition of the genus, is because it is supposed that the contents of a genus must possess closer ‘affinity ” than species of separate genera. But this is not the case in many instances, and may not be so in any instance where the evolution of generic characters becomes known. Certain it is that in the embryonic life none of the specific characters appear before the generic. Hence, species may be polyphyletic as regards genera.
The essential of systematic biology is exact definition. Taxonomy is science only in so far as it is exact. If it be alleged that gradual evolution of characters must preclude the possibility of exact definition, I answer that this will only become a practical truth when all intermediate forms have been discovered. And it will never be a practical truth for the botany and zoology of any single geologic epoch or period—as, for instance, the present one—since most of the connecting forms belong to past periods and are not treated of in works in zoology, but in those in paleontology. There is therefore no excuse for the loose and inexact definitions which some taxonomists are accustomed to inflict on the world, which are both unscientific, and serve at the same time to obscure the subject and render it inaccessible to the student. It must be admitted, however, that in a few instances it occurs that transition between two important anatomical characters is discoverable in series of species of the existing period. The special nature of such a case will determine whether definitions with exceptions stated are admissible or not.
In the matter of nomenclature the author necessarily follows the rule of priority now adopted in all codes, and the definitions of priority contained in the report of the committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science of 1876. According to these rules, a name can only have a status when accompanied with a description or diagnosis of that to which it is applied, whether species, genus, or division of higher rank. In the case of species, a recognizable figure is regarded as of equal validity with a description, but a figure possesses no discriminative character as a definition of any higher group. I must here insist on another point, which it has not been thought necessary hitherto to incorporate into any system of rules, since it is one which lies at the basis of all language. That is that names shall be properly spelled. This is necessary on account of the attempts on the part of more or less illiterate persons to construct names for the use of biologists, and on account of the fact that certain other naturalists, not so illiterate, feel bound to adopt their misspellings, and typographical errors as well, on account of the supposed exigencies of the law of

<<<Page: 182>>>

priority. Most of these persons take refuge behind the rules of the American Ornithologists Union, and if the code of that body furnishes defense for these violations of the elementary principles of language, it should be corrected. Among misspellings are to be included hybrid words and words which retain the Greek and other nonLatin spellings. It may be repeated here that the language of scientific nomenclature is Latin, and words derived from Greek and other languages are spelled according to the rules of the Latin language.
It is stated above that the geographical scope of the present book is the Nearctic realm. The southern continental boundary of this realm is, however, not yet entirely clear. It evidently includes a large part of the Mexican state of Sonora and the Mexican Plateau for a considerable distance farther south. Owing to lack of collections, it is difficult to state what the limit is in this direction, but I have included the state of Guanajuato, where Dr. Alfredo Duges has traced many of the Northern species. On the east coast the fauna of the Tierra Caliente extends northward to and even a little beyond the Rio Grande. In southwestern Texas the presence of the genera of snakes, Sibon, Coniophanes, and Drymobius, indicates the northern limit of that fauna.
The resuits contained herein are derived chiefly from the collections of the United States National Museum. To these I have added information based on my own collections and observations in the field. The whole constitutes the first general work on the North American Sauria since that of Holbrook in 1845, and the only one on the Ophidia since the book of Baird and Girard, published in 1853. Professor Baird had such a work on the Sauria in contemplation during his lifetime, and he placed his manuscript in my hands about the year 1864 for completion. Of this manuscript I have made considerable use in the following pages, the greater part of the descriptions of fifty-one of the one hundred and nine known species of that suborder being from his pen.
In the description of the general characters and distribution of the genera of the families of the lizards I have frequently copied the language of Boulenger in the Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum, with omissions and additions. In the systematic arrangement of the genera of families of lizards, of which I have been able to examine but a limited number of species preserved in spirits, as the Geckonidie, Agamide, and Gerrhosaurid, I have also followed Boulenger.
Besides the collections of the U. S. National Museum, I have examined, in the preparation of this book, material belonging to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and to the Philadelphia museums, to whose officers my thanks are especially due. I wish to acknowledge also my indebtedness to Dr. Alexander Agassiz for the opportunity of examining some Australian species; to Prof. Charles S.

I am also especially indebted to the Zoological Society of Philadelphia and its superintendent, Mr. Arthur E. Brown, for specimens from the Gardens.

Class MONOCONDYLIA. Subclass RE PTILIA
The subelass Reptilia is one of the two into which the members of the class Monocondylia naturally fall. It is defined as follows:
Basicranial axis ossified. Vertebral column consisting chiefly of centra. Limbs of the nonpiscine type, that is, embracing a single proximal element, two propodials, several mesopodials, metapodial, and phalangeal elements. One occipita leondyle. <A distinct quadrate bone, or suspensorium of the lower jaw. Mandible segmented. Carpal, tarsal, and metapodial elements not coossified with each other.
Cerebral hemispheres larger than mesencephalon, whose moieties are fully exposed above, and not laterally. Cerebellum small. Heart with three chambers. Aorta derived from two aorta roots, which consist of one or two bows on each side. Lungs cellular, functional. Gall bladder, pancreas, and fat-bodies present. Integument scaly. Mammary glands, none.
Reproduction viviparous or ovoviviparous. Fertilization internal. Copulatory organs present. Embryo with amnion and allantois; placenta, none.
The Reptilia are definitely known to appear in geological time in the Coal Measures, near the close of the Carboniferous system, although they probably appeared earlier during that system. They are represented by a number of orders, which are distinguished as follows:

Quadrate bone united by immovable suture with the adjacent elements; 2 postorbital longitudinal bars; cervical and dorsal ribs mostly two-headed, the capitulum articuiating with the centrum, with or without parapophyses, and the tuberculum with the diapophyses. Sacrum composed of but few vertebrz. Acetabulum closed. Sternum and interclavicle present; abdominal ribs not connected with the true ribs, and composed of separate segments. Bones of proximal series of carpus and tarsus specialized. Teeth in alveoli.
Ventricle of the heart divided. Two aorta roots. Epencephalon with vermis and flocculi. Copulatory organ single. Anal orifice longitudinal.
The order of the Loricata appeared in Triassic time, and has continued up to the present day. The Triassic types differ from those of subsequent ages, so that they represent a suborder distinct from the latter. In Jurassic and Cretaceous time the order was represented by the greatest number of genera and species. Their distribution has been cosmopolitan since their appearance. The affinities of the order are with the Dinosauria, with which they are connected by the suborder Sauropoda of the latter.
The suborders differ as follows:

The Parasuchia include, so far as yet known, tlie single family of the Belodontid. They are restricted to the Triassic system. The families of the Eusuchia are the following:

The first two families do not extend beyond Mesozoic time. The Crocodilide commence in North America in the Upper Cretaceous; in other parts of the world in the Hocene. We have to do with this family only in the present work. Its genera differ as follows:

The genera Thoracosaurus and Holops are restricted, with present knowledge, to the Upper Cretaceous formations of North America. The other genera still exist, and are restricted to the warmer regions of the earth. Tomistoma is Malaysian; Crocodilus is cosmopolitan ; Osteolemus is African, while the other genera are South American, except Alligator. This genus includes one North American and one east. Asiatic species and one of unknown habitat. Gavialis is Indian.
In North America we have to do with the widely distributed Alligator mississippiensis and the Crocodilus americanus, which ranges to the southern part of the peninsula of Florida from an extensive habitat in tropical America.
Many remarkable peculiarities characterize the osteology of this family.
The pterygoids havea very peculiar form. They are much expanded transversely posteriorly, resembling in this respect the Cotylosauria and some of the Theromora of the Permian, but with this the resemblance ceases. Near the middle line of the skull each one directs its free posterior margin upward, assuming the direction of the basicranial axis and, surrounding the posterior nares behind, unites with the inferior descending axis of the sphenoid by a transverse serrate suture. The pterygoid plate does not continue its vertical direction for long, but soon unites with the quadrate posteriorly and the alisphenoid anteriorly by a serrate suture. This union of the pterygoid with the proximal extremity of the quadrate, instead of the distal, is a specialization peculiar to this family among reptiles. The superior prolongation of the
a a re

<<<Page: 188>>>

zygomatic (quadratojugal) to the supratemporomastoid and postfrontal is equally peculiar to it. Another peculiarity is the non-entrance of the exoccipital bone into the occipital condyle. Another remarkable peculiarity is the union, a short distance below the brain case, of the Eustachian tubes into a single median vertical canal, which descends to the pharynx between the vertical axes of the basioccipital and sphenoid bones.
The mandibular ramus is characterized by the distinctness of all the elements and by two especial peculiarities. One of these is the absence of coronoid process, the coronoid bone being a scale on the interior side of the ramus. The other is the presence of a very large foramen between the angular and surangular bones on the external face of the ramus, which communicates with the large dental canal.
The vertebre are procwlous throughout. There are no intercentra except the chevron bones and a preatlantal element, which articulates with the lower part of the occipital condyle in front, and underlaps the os entatum, or centrum of the atlas; posteriorly. This first and only cervical intercentrum sends out, posteriorly and downward on each side, a long intercentral rib. The atlas consists of separate elements, viz, centrum, neurapophysis, and neural spine. The centrum is united by suture with that of the axis vertebra, and the neurapophyses are in contact anteriorly below with the intercentrum. They narrow upward to a Squamosal suture with the neural spine, which is a thin, curved element. The cervical ribs are short, and unite with a parapophysis and diapophysis. The dorsal ribs have the capitular articulation on the centrum, and the tubercular on the diapophysis for a short distance, but the capitular articulation soon rises to the diapophysis, remaining distinct from the tubercular. There are two sacral vertebra, and no sacral ribs.
There is no clavicle, proscapula, or epicoracoid. The coracoid is in contact with the anterior lateral border of the sternum. The suprascapula is represented by a cartilage. The ilium is short anteroposteriorly and does not extend anteriorly to the acetabulum, but does extend for a short distance posteriorly to it. The pubis is excluded from the acetabulum, articulating with the anterior base of the ischium. The pubes are directed forward and have no symphysis, being connected by cartilage only. They have no connection with the ischia on the median line. The ischia are directed downward to a median symphysis.
There are three elements in the proximal carpal series. Of these the radiale and intermedium support the foot, and are remarkable for their longitudinal elongation. The carpalia are more or less aborted. The tarsalia are remarkable for the specialization of the bones of the first tow. They are two in number; the large astragalus consisting, apparently, of the tibiale and intermedium tarsi. The fibulare (caleaneum) has what has not been shown to exist elsewhere amon g Reptilia, a tuber

<<<Page: 189>>>

caleis. Both these elements have a distal convex condylar surface for the elements distal to them. The tarsalia are partially aborted.
No urinary bladder. A rudimental diaphragm. The viscera are more particularly described under the genus Alligator.

Fourth mandibular tooth fitting into a pit in the upper jaw. Snout rather short; nasal bones forming a septum dividing the nasal aperture; supratemporal foss open, splenial bones not entering the mandibular symphysis. A dorsal shield formed of juxtaposed, keeled, bony scutes; gular and ventral scutes without or with thin ossifications.
Osteology.—My knowledge of the osteology of this genus is derived exclusively from the A. mississippiensis.
Premaxillaries with the spine very short, and uniting by suture with the produced apices of the nasal bones. Lateral plate in considerable sutural union with the nasals posterior to the nares. Frontal produced in a narrow process between prefrontals. A small supraorbital bone anteriorly placed. Parietal-like frontal, undivided, not sending out supramastoid processes, and extending to the posterior border of the superior table of the skull. Supratemporo-mastoid sending out a lateroposterior process almost to the extremity of the exoccipital, and bounded below posteriorly by the quadrate, medially by the meatus auditorius, and ‘anteriorly from before backward, by the quadrate, the superior process of the zygomatic, and by the postorbital part of the postfrontoorbital. Anteriorly it is bounded by the postfrontal part of the postfronto-orbital. The articular surface of the quadrate is directed as much backward as downward. ‘The zygomatic reaches its distal extremity in front, while the jugal is continued three-fourths way from its first point of contact with the zygomatic to its extremity. The parieto-quadrate arch is not entirely fused with the elements lying below it, as it is not united with the supraoccipital by suture, except on the middle line. The lateral part of the superior border of the supraoccipital is a Smooth tuberosity, and a foramen passes entirely below the supratemporo-mastoid bone to the supratemporal foramen. Another canal passes between the exoccipital and quadrate from behind forward and inward to the temporal fossa. The supraoccipital does not reach the foramen magnum below, but the latter is inclosed above by the exoccipitals. The latter do not enter into the composition of the occipital condyle, which consists e1tirely of the basioccipital.
The quadrate is remarkably extended forward. Below, it sends down a broad process to join the pterygoid, medially it joins the

<<<Page: 190>>>

petrosal, while above it joins the alisphenoid, and to a less degree the parietal. In its junction with the petrosal it overlaps that bone so far as to almost exclude it from the external wall of the brain case, and it can only be seen by looking within the posterior border of the trigeminal foramen. The alisphenoid is well developed, and joins above the decurved border of the parietal posteriorly, the postfrontal medially, and the frontal anteriorly. The alisphenoids meet on the middle line, leaving a large foramen above for the rhinencephalon, and a large 8-shaped foramen below. The inferior part of the latter is immediately posterior to the keel-like anterior process of the sphenoid. A strong process descends to the pterygoid, bounding the trigeminal foramen in front. This represents the epipterygoid of the Sauria. No orbitosphenoid or other interorbital bone.
The anterior half of the basioccipital has its longitudinal axis vertieal. The long axis of the sphenoid is also vertical. The medullary part of the brain case is roofed by the exoccipitals only, but the supraoccipital bounds the epencephalon above. The petrosal is much more conspicuous on the internal than on the external wall of the brain case. It is suboval, and is bounded by the alisphenoid, sphenoid, exoccipital, supraoccipital, and to a small degree by the parietal. It is deeply notched in front by the trigeminal foramen. Although the sphenoid is mainly vertical in position it sends forward between the alisphenoids a vertically compressed plate, already mentioned. The occipital and sphenoid elements are coarsely cellular at various points. The pterygoids unite together on the median line and join the sphenoid behind the posterior nares. The pterygoids send forward a process above the palatines to the front of the orbits, where they cease. Here a strong process of the prefrontal descends on each side and rests on the adjacent parts of the palatine and pterygoid. These processes are separate on the middle line above and below, but touch at the middle of their length. The ectopterygoids are large and each sends a process forward on the maxillary, and a longer one on the pterygoid. The palatine and maxillary bones are in mutual contact on the middle line, and no part of the vomer or ethmoid is visible on the external surface.
The mandibular ramus has a rather elongate angle, which has its superior concave surface divided lengthwise by an obtuse ridge. The articular bone forms the greater part of the angle, the angular being a narrow strip on its inferior side, which forms the apex, the surangular sending a narrow splint on the external side, which does not extend so far as the two other elements. The cotylus is not divided by a ridge, but a transverse section is gently sigmoid, descending inward. The coronoid is a large scale in front of the very large dental foramen, and does not extend anterior to the vertical line of the angular. A large foramen is inclosed between the latter and the splenial. The latter element forms the entire internal side of the ramus, terminating acutely below and within the fourth tooth. The groove in front of its apex is

<<<Page: 191>>>

closed with a straight suture at the fundus. ‘There is a foramen on the inner side of the splenial opposite the eighteenth tooth, counting from the front. The angular extends farther forward than the surangular, and its narrow apical portion is on the inferior face of the ramus, terminating at the eighteenth tooth.
In young specimens the posterior alveoli are not separated from each other, and the crowns of the teeth are more compressed than in adults.
The atlantal neural spine has no spinous process, but it is well developed on the other vertebrie. The atlas sends posteriorly a slender rib, which is slightly bifurcate proximally. The other cervical ribs send a distal process forward as well as backward. The dorsal ribs have a small cartilaginous uncinate process near their distal extremities. The abdominal ribs consist of four ossicles, forming a chevron directed forward. ‘The interclavicle has no transverse branch, and extends well in advance of the sternum and nearly to its posterior border. The hemal ribs unite with the sternum, as follows: Two pairs unite directly, and four pairs with a median xiphoid cartilage.
The coracoid is an elongate element, distally truncate, without notches or processses; the usual foramen pierces it near the base. The scapula is of somewhat similar form; it has no proor meso-scapular process or angle. The humerus has one compressed tuberosity at a considerable distance distad of the head. The distal extremity much resembles that of the femur. The ulna is robust proximally, and the olecranon is represented by a large sesamoid bone. The shaft of the radius less compressed than that of the ulna, but is not very different in actual sectional area. Its distal articular surface is a little larger than that of the ulna, and is at nearly a right angle to it. In the carpus the radiale is a much larger bone than the intermedium, but both are similar in form, being much longer than wide, and having expanded extremities and contracted shafts. Their distal articular faces are concave. The ulnare projects freely backward. There is but one carpale, and that corresponds with the third digit. The I and II are represented by a cartilage. No centrals. Digits five, of which the third is longest and the fifth shortest. The I, Il, and III only have the distal phalanges unguiform and sheathed with horny claws.
The ilium projects as far as the diapophysis of the first caudal vertebra but does not fuse with it. The proximal end of the ischium is deeply notched, which causes a perforation of the acetabulum. The femur is longer than the humerus and the head is less compressed. There is no distinction into the head and neck. There is but one trochanter and that is on the posterior aspect and presents its tuberosity distad. The condyle of the femur is not divided; no patella. The fibula is much more slender than the tibia at all points. The astragalus articulates with the fibula as well as with the tibia; its face of articulation with the caleaneum is excavated. The latter has a convex fibula surface, while the tibial surface of the astragalus is concave. Posterior to the fibular condyle the calcaneum is excavated, and the tuber calcanei is

<<<Page: 192>>>

somewhat recurved at the apex. It is obliquely truncate behind and below. The inferior face is excavated and the distal plane. There are three tarsalia corresponding to four external digits; the first digit articulating directly with the astragalus, the second digit joins one tarsale, the third and fourth one, while the fifth digit islacking. The fifth tarsale is produced like a rudimental metatarsal. The three interior digits only have unguiform distal phalanges with corneous sheaths,
Viscera. —The heart is situated in the anterior part of the body cayity, and the lungs extend about half their length posterior to it. The latter extend cousiderably cephalad of the bronchi, which enter at about the posterior third of their length, at right angles to the axis of the body. The liver is completely divided into right and left moieties, each of which sends posteriorly a process of its external portion. The alimentary canal is distinguished for the strong differentiation of the stomach, which much exceeds anything known in the Sauria. The cardium and pylorus are each small orifices, and the stomach has a fundus at either end external and caudad to each. Toward the pyloric fundus the walls are very thick with muscle. At its apex is a small diverticulum in the A. mississippiensis. The small intestine is of relatively small diameter and the large intestine is large, and is not distinguished into coion and rectum, and has no cecum. The kidney is coarsely lobate. ;
The mesenteries are not so simple as in the Sauria, as they are less less distinct from each other, and send branehes in different directions. The cesophagus has, besides the dorsal connection, connecticn with the pericardium. The lungs are connected with both, and distally with the cephalad surfaee of the liver. The liver has connection posteriorly with all of these viscera, which is not muscular, but which represents the dorsal part of the pericardium. <A longitudinal fold connects the pericardium with the two halves of the liver and the stomach, representing the gastrohepatic mesentery of the Sauria. From the caudad margin of the liver on the right side a sheet extends to the body wall, remaining free from the latter as far posteriorly as the kidney. A corresponding sheet extends from the distal aspect of the stomach on the right side. Both are connected with the body wall by bands and threads. From each lobe of the liver near the median line a sheet extends to the median body wall below, which is strongly muscular. This is regarded as homologous with the inferior portion of the diaphragm of the mammals, and this with the posterior transverse hepatodorsal sheet may correspond with that structure. If so, the important difference remains that in the alligator it includes the liver between its two layers, while in the mammals it is entirely superior to the liver.
The tympanic drum is deeply set beneath the superior postorbital bar. It is protected by a fold of the integument which forms a flap, which is suspended trom the postorbital bar, closing the orifice like a lid.

Nineteen or twenty upper and as many lower teeth on each side; head nearly twice as long as broad; snout much depressed, broadly rounded at the end, with the lateral outline nearly straight; a very short ridge in front of the orbit; upper eyelid bony anteriorly; two pairs of large nuchal scutes, forming a square, separated on the median line, with a pair of small ones in front and another pair behind; seventeen or eighteen transverse series of dorsal scutes, the broadest composed of eight scutes; fingers hardly half webbed, outer toes about twothirds webbed; tail strongly compressed and crested posteriorly. Dark green or blackish above, young with yellowish cross bands, lower parts yellowish.
Total length, 2 meters 20 centimeters; reaches a length of 4 meters (about 16 feet).
In young specimens, of a meter in length, the anterior parts of the nasal and maxillary bones present coarse, flat tuberosities, while the middle parts of those bones are nearly smooth. In adults the former regions are nearly smooth, while the latter are pitted, producing a shallow honeycombed surface. The posterior parts of the same bones

are nearly smooth, or feebly ridged longitudinally. The frontal, postfrontal, parietal, and supratemporo-mastoid are always pitted. There is a low longitudinal median ridge of the frontal bone between the anterior parts of the orbits. The olfactory groove of the frontal is narrow, and their lateral walls robust and low. The posterior part of the surangular bone is honeycombed, while the dentary is smooth, but is perforated by numerous small foramina.
The vertebree number as follows: C., 8; D., 10; L., 7; 8., 2; C., 36. The neural spines of the cervicals are narrower anteroposteriorly than those of the dorsals, except that of the axis, which is much the longest, but is not moreelevated than the others. The hypapophysis of the second cervical is very low, but those of the other cervicals and of the anterior four dorsals are well developed; there is a low one on the fifth dorsal. The mutual surfaces of the centra of the second sacral and first caudal are flat. But three of the ribs articulate with the vertebral centra, the remainder having the capitular articulations with the diapophyses at increasing distances from their bases. Of the caudal vertebra the anterior 18 have diapophyses. The first and second have no chevrons, which are present on the following 21. The terminal centra are much compressed. The last abdominal rib is much more robust than the others. It is similarly composed and posteriorly joins the pubes at their bases. The phalanges areas follows: Manus, 2-3-4-3-3; pes, 2-3-4-3, These details are derived from a skeleton in the museum of the School of Biology of the University of Pennsylvania.
The alligator is characteristic of the Austroriparian region, ranging from North Carolina to the Rio Grande of Texas. I have examined
‘erania of individuals taken in the Nueces River, Texas, and do not find them to differ in any respect from those taken in Florida.
As regards the range of the alligator up the Mississippi, I have gained the following information through my friend, Mr. Julius Hurter, of St. Louis, who has for many years made a study of the batrachians and reptiles of Missouri. He states that the oldest residents of the southeastern county of that State have no knowledge ot the occurrence of the species in that locality. The most northern locality with which Mr. Hurter is personally acquain!ed is Rodney, Jefferson County, Miss., about latitude 32°,
Dr. Hugh M. Smith,! of the United States Fish Commission, says that—
The maternal alligator in April or May seeks a sheltered spot on a bank and there builds asmall mound. The foundation of the mound is of mud and grass, and on this she lays some eggs. She covers the eggs with another stratum of grass and mud, upon which she deposits some more eggs. ‘Thus she proceeds until she has laid from 100 to 200 eggs.
The eggs in the course of time are hatched by the sun, assisted by the heat which the decomposition of the vegetable material generates. As soon as they have “chipped the shell,” the baby alligators are led to the water by the mother, who

provides them with food which she disgorges, showing much anxiety for their safety. At this early period of their existence they are exposed to many dangers, being a favorite prey of fishes and turtles. Alligators’ eggs are sometimes eaten by the Florida crackers. The robbing of the nests for market is helping to hasten the ineyitable destruction of the alligator fishery, which has been an important and profitable industry in Florida. Facts recently gathered by the Fish Commission show that the reptiles can not long escape practical extermination. Already they are becoming scarce, and the price of hides has gone up.
_ It is estimated that 2,500,000 alligators were killed in Florida between 1880 and 1894.
In 1890 about 250 pounds of alligator teeth were sold, hunters receiving from $1 to $2 a pound for them. They are removed by burying the heads and rotting out the teeth. Of the best teeth, about seventy make a pound. The stuffing of alligators and the polishing of the teeth give employment to forty persons. Unfortunately, alligators grow very slowly. At 15 years of age they are only 2 feet long. A 12-footer may be reasonably supposed to be 75 years old.
The artifical propagation of alligators has been recently undertaken to supply the trade in Florida curiosities.
The incubator system employed is quite simple. The eggs, which are about the size of those of a goose, are placed in boxes of sand and covered up. The boxes are exposed on a roof to the torrid rays of a tropical sun, and in a few days the young reptiles are hatched.

Concerning this genus Boulenger remarks:!
Notwithstanding all that has been written on the specific characters of the crocodiles, their distinction and definition remains a matter of considerable difficulty. Although the extreme forms, viz, C. cataphractus and C. patustris, differ very widely, the passage is so complete as to render even subgeneric divisions unadvisable. The following key will, I hope, suffice in most cases for the exact determination of the species, except with respect to newly born specimens, which can only be named by comparison with older examples.
Boulenger then gives the foliowing table of the species:
I, Snout very slender, gavial-like, at least twice as long as broad at the base; mandibular symphysis extending to the level of the sixth, seventh, or eighth tooth; premaxillo-maxillary suture, on the palate, produced

Specimens from Tehuantepec, on the west coast of Mexico, exhibit from two to four nuchal scuta and from two to five cervical. Several specimens present the irregularity of having seuta of the external dorsal series to join on the middle line of the back, replacing the median row of scutes at those points.!

Mr. W. T. Hornaday originally observed this species to be an inhabitant of the seacoast, streams, and lakes of southeastern Florida,! ranging north as far as Lake Worth, a hundred miles north of the southern extremity of the State. From this point Mr. Ward, of Rochester, New York, obtained a specimen 9 feet in length. Mr. Hornaday supposed these individuals to represent a species different from that of more southern waters, but I have been unable to detect any difference. The largest specimen he obtained measured 14 feet in length.
In its preference for salt water this species differs from the alligator. It is said also to be more vicious in its disposition. A specimen between 4 and 5 feet in length was once sent me by my late friend, Professor Poey, of Havana. I kept it tethered in a yard and observed its manners. It was ill-natured and not afraid to attack either by snapping its jaws or striking with its tail.
A specimen of this species was sent to the National Museum from Mazatlan, on the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico. This is the nearest point to the Nearctic realm at which it has been found on the Pacific coast.
No quadratojugal (zygomatic) arch; quadrate therefore articulated by its proximal extremity only. Noostabulare. Paroccipital present; opisthotic early fused with the supramastoid, probably fused with the parietal. Nostrils, both external and internal, subterminal. Maxillopalatines, palatines, and pterygoids distinct, paired; ectopterygoid present and distinct. Teeth on maxillary and dentary bones. Stapes with a long shaft, or columella, terminating in a cartilage.
Vertebral centra proccelous, rarely amphiccelous; caudals with cheyrons. Neural arches coossified with centrum, except atlas, which has neurapophyses separate from body and from each other; odontoid process distinct. Not more than two vertebrae in sacrum. Cervical ribs. Dorsal ribs single (i. e., tubercular) headed, articulating with diapophyses; one to several pairs articulating with sternum. No sacral ribs. No tegumeutary abdominal bones.
Scapular arch, when developed, consisting of suprascapula, scapula, precoracoid, coracoid, clavicle, and interclavicle; frequently a proscapula. The scapula is not coossified with the other elements. Coracoid articulating with the simple plate-like sternum. Pelvic areh, when complete, embracing the three elements, which inclose below a large obturator foramen. Ilium directed backward and upward.
Brain with large olfactory lobes, which are not as large as the hemiSpheres. The latter are larger than the thalami, and their ventricles are on the external side of their nucleus (corpus striatum). Thalami exposed above as well as laterally. Cerebellum small, without flocculi.

<<<Page: 201>>>

Central canal of spinal cord present. The eye possesses the usual character of the Monocondylia in the presence of the pecten, which extends from the choroidea to the sheath of the lens. It is not so plicate as in birds. The organ of hearing conforms to the same type in the absence of a helix and the presence of a lagena and sacculus. The sympathetic nervous system is well developed and presents the series of subvertebral ganglia.
The alimentary canal is little specialized in the different parts of its course, but the stomach is distinguished by its greater diameter and generally more muscular walls. The diameter of the rectum generally exceeds that of the preceding parts of the canal. Gall bladder and pancreas present. Adipose bodies present.
Heart with three chambers; two auricles and one ventricle. The latter gives origin to a truncus communis arteriosus, which sends off one or two aorta bows on each side, which combine to form a single aorta root on each side, which fuse into the single aorta on the middle line below the vertebral column. <A sinus venosus. Posterior vena cava, formed from the renal veins and traversing the liver after receiving the portal vein. It is received, together with two jugulars, into the sinus venosus. Posterior vertebral veins running below the ribs.
Sexes distinct. Testis and vas deferens distinct from renal ducts, discharging separately into cloaca. Males with two prehensile organs, each inclosed in a sheath, one on each side of the base of the tail. They are everted toward the cloacal orifice when in use and are retracted by invagination by the contraction of an axial muscle. They are traversed by a groove, the suleus spermaticus, which, beginning at the base on the inner side, winds to the apex on the outer side, uniting into a short, common vagina opening into the cloaca from above to receive the male prehensile organs. Oviducts distinct: The oviduct consists of a tube, which, when not containing eggs, is collapsed, falling into numerous parallel, transverse folds. These folds are held in place by an elastic band on each opposite border. The margin of the fontanelle is of delicate membrane, and it is attached to the body wall by a delicate fold of peritoneum
The integument is characteristically divided into small areas or scales, by confluent inflections. These are occasionally the seat of osseous deposit (Scincidz, Gerrhonotidae), but this is exceptional. No osseous scuta, other than the cases mentioned. This description applies as well to the extinct Pythonomorpha as to the Sauria and Ophidia. Abdominal scales generally different from the dorsal.
The integument of the head is divided in many types into plates of definite relations, which are homologous throughout the various subdivisions, and even between the suborders of Sauria and Ophidia. In general, it may be believed that these plates have resulted from the fusion of scales, both because scales are the primitive covering of the body and are less specialized than the head plates, but also because

the types of affinity with the extinct types have scaly heads; for instance, the Sphenodon of the Rhynchocephalian order is approached closely in scale characters by the Pachygloss lizard. The Boide, among snakes, recognized as the most primitive forms, also have generally scaly heads and few or no plates. The scaly head also characterives some of the higher types of snakes, as many Solenoglypha, as well as the degenerate Epanodonta and Catodonta; while most of the degenerate Sauria have head plates, but more or less fused.

The Squamata are found in all except the Arctic and Antarctic regions of the earth. Their numbers, both in species and individuals, increase as we approach the Tropics. They are preeminently terrestrial animals, and are never found far from shore, excepting certain snakes which live in the ocean. On land they inhabit all localities that supply food and shelter, whether in trees, on the surface of the earth, or beneath the surface, or along the shores of bodies of water. ‘They are for the greater part carnivorous, but certain lizards and a very few snakes are herbivorous.
The Squamata, like other reptiles, possess much muscular power, and above all others many of them are capable of great speed of motion. Many of the arboreal species climb with wonderful rapidity, and others get over the ground with great swiftness. Such are especially the Teiide, or swift lizards, who are almost invisible when running, and some of the snakes. A few lizards (Amblyrhynchus) are good swimmers, while along all bodies of fresh water dwell snakes which are such expert swimmers that they readily capture the fishes on which they prey. The prehensile power of the Peropodous snakes is well known, enabling them to kill small and medium-sized mammals by involving them in their coils. Certain of the snakes have none of the remarkable powers of speed, prehension, or swiftness possessed by others, but are protected by a formidable poisonous biting apparatus, which enables them to inflict mortal wounds on their prey, and which places them in the front rank of dangerous animals.
The Squamata exhibit a low order of intelligence. Most of them give few exhibitions of it, and it is then generally in connection with obtaining food. They sometimes appear to recognize the person that feeds them, and will overcome their timidity so far as to take food from. the hand. I give an account, under the head of Liopeltis vernalis, of a ruse adopted by this species for the purpose of taking prey; and under Heterodon platyrhinus, of actions apparently intended to inspire fear in a venomous snake with which it was confined.
The Squamata are known under three principal modifications or suborders, as follows:

Of these three suborders, the Pythonomorpha is extinct, having begun and ended with Cretaceous time. The Sauria and Ophidia are the subjects of the present work. Both begin in Cretaceous time, so far as our present knowledge extends, but it is at the existing geologie period of time that they present the greatest multiplication of individuals and species. This statement is, of course, provisional and dependent on future discoveries in paleontology for its verification or contradiction.
The superficial characters given by systematic writers generally as
distinguishing the Sauria and Ophidia are quite insufficient for that purpose. Johannes Miiller! first placed the distinction on a sound basis by showing that in the Ophidia the frontal and parietal bones descend to the basi-cranial axis as in no other vertebrates, thus closing the brain case in front, while in the Sauria this does not occur, and as the aliand orbito-sphenoid bones are rudimental or wanting, the brain case is without osseous wall in front. Some lizards present a distinct approximation to the ophidian type in the strong decurvature of the parietal bones at the rides; these are the Annulati and the Annielloida. These groups display a similar approximation in the continuous sutural union of the occipital and parietal elements, a condition universal in Ophidia and rare in Sauria. ' I have pointed out? another point of distinction between the two divisions, viz, that the supratemporal (‘‘ squamosal” olim) is present in the Sauria and absent in the Ophidia. As it is, however, absent in the Annielloida and Amphisbenia, I have not included it in the definition of the former suborder. This definition has not been adopted by those authors who erroneously regard the suspensorium of the quadrate bone in the Ophidia as identical with the supratemporal of the lizards. I pointed out in the above essay (1871) that this element in the snakes is homologous with the paroccipital of the Sauria, an opinion which was not agreed with at that time, but which has now received the assent of various anatomists, notably Professor Baur.
Baur and some others do not, however, agree that the element in question is the paroccipital, but call it squamosal and other names. I was led to identify it with the former element of the Testudinata, ete., by a consideration of its structure in the Pythonomorpha,’ where it is much more largely developed than in the Sauria, and where it supports the quadrate bone as in the Ophidia, which it does not do, or does only partially in a few cases, in the Sauria. I have made this more clear than heretofore I hope in a recent essay. The paroccipital bone is received deeply between the exoccipital and the petrosal in the Pythonomorpha in the same manner as in the Tortricine snakes, a structure which does not occur in the Sauria. This structure is somewhat

masked in some genera of Pythonomorpha by the extension of the exoccipital over the paroccipital as a thin lamina on the posterior side; but its true relation to the petrosal can be seen on the anterior side. There can be no doubt that the Pythonomorpha form a line distinct from the Sauria, and that their resemblances to the Varani are the result of a parallel evolution rather than an indication of near affinity, as supposed by Cuvier.
The failure of Cuvier, Owen, Dollo, Baur, and Marsh to perceive this fact is due to their want of information as to what the differences between the Ophidia and Sauria really are. Boulenger only has reached correct views on the subject, although not on account of the structure of the paroccipital, but on account of the character of the dentition and of the limbs.’
The third character which I have pointed out as distinguishing the suborders of Squamata is the difference in the mode of articulation of the quadrate bone with the adjacent cranial elements. In the Sauria it articulates with the exoccipital, being also in contact with the paroccipital and the supratemporal. The contact with the paroccipital is insignificant, owing to the small size of that element; and that with the supratemporal is only important where that bone is well developed. In many Sauria it is feeble or wanting. In the Pythonomorpha and Ophidia on the other hand the quadrate articulates with the paroccipital, sometimes touching the supratemporal in the former. In some of the degraded Ophidia, as the Typhlopidz and Stenostomide, the paroccipital is not distinct, so that the quadrate appears to rest on the exoccipital and the petrosal. It will, however, be necessary to subject these types to more searching investigation before it can be known that the paroccipital is absent.
As exceptions to the rule in the Sauria, Boulenger has pointed out that the quadrate does not reach the exoccipital in the Agamid genus Chlamydosaurus,? and I have found the same condition in Phrynocephalus.®
From this point of view the Ophidia and Pythonomorpha must be traced to some type in which the paroccipital bone is less remote from the brain case than is seen in the Sauria, where it has become a mere rudiment. Such a phylogeny would be expressed as follows. An investigation of the Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous might yield interesting results.

This common ancestor is a land reptile with the peculiar character of the paroccipital seen in the Pythonomorpha. Whether it would enter this suborder remains to be ascertained. Irom it the Saurian type has been derived by the reduction of the paroccipital, and its wide remova! from the cranial wall. The ophidian order has resulted from an enlargement of this element, together with its exclusion from the cranial walls, to which it nevertheless remains adherent. Boulenger! suggests that the Dolichosauria occupy this position.
The Squamata display among Reptilia tendencies which reach their extreme expression in the Ophidia. These are, as already pointed out, first, the disposition to reduction in the use of the limbs as supports of the body, and a consequent increasing tendency to rest the body on the ground when in motion; second, the increasing mobility of the suspensorium of the mandible, permitting an increase in the gape of the mouth, and the consequent capacity for swallowing large bodies. These tendencies are seen, first, in the successive shortening of the limbs and reduction in the number of the digits, and finally reduction and abolition of the limbs themselves. Itis characteristic of the entire suborder that the ribs have only the tubercular articulation with the veterbrie, having lost the capitular, thus reducing the strength of the Suspension of the viscera from the vertebral column. It thus becomes first comfortable, and finally necessary that the body should be supported by the earth or object on which the animal rests, the process being identical with that which has taken place in the Cetacea, which have also lost the capitular rib articulations after long suspension of the body in the water. This change is, of course, completed by the total loss of limbs, as is seen in many Sauria and in all Ophidia. The freedom of the distal extremity of the quadrate bone gives mobility to the mandible; but this function does not reach any great development in the Sauria, and is but little more obvious in the inferior Ophidia (Angiostomata). In the Ophidia generally it acquires an enormous development, most of all in the highest venomous forms (Solenoglypha).
The order Squamata was first correctly delimited by Merrem in 1820,’ who included in it only the Sauria and Ophidia. The name was proposed by Oppel? in 1811, but he included in it the crocodiles. The character viewed by these authors as definitive was the possession of tegumentary scales, in contrast to the osseous carapace of the Testudinata. They were unacquainted with the various anatomical characters which distinguish the order from all others. The Sauria and Ophidia were regarded as orders by other authors, including Duméril, in accordance with the system of Brongniart (1799).

was Latreille. In 1825, in his Familles Naturelles du Réegne Animal, he separated the Squamata, under the name Squamosa, from the tortoises and crocodiles, on account of the slight fixity of the quadrate bone, the double male intromittent organs, and the structure of the feet. He was followed in this after a long interval by Stannius, who in 1856 reviewed the Squamata under the name of Streptostylica,! including in it the two orders Sauria and Ophidia. I adopted this name as that of a superorder in 1871,’ including in it the Sauria and Ophidia, and a third order, the Pythonomorpha, which I had already proposed in 1869 for the mosasauroid reptiles. This arrangement was retained in a synopsis of the families of Vertebrata published in 1889, except that the term Squamata was employed instead of Streptostylica, and was applied to an order instead of a superorder. This arrangement is continued in the present work. Dr. Boulenger has adopted this system, but added the chameleons, or Rhiptoglossa, to the list of orders, increasing the number to fuur. This change is not adopted in the present work. The solidarity of the order Squamata is attested by the reproductive system as well as by the osseous, and especially by the characters of the male intromittent organ, as I have recently pointed out.
The following summary of the osteology of the Sauria is based on examinations of the specimens contained in most of the museums of Europe and of this country. For North American forms I am prineipally indebted to the United States National Museum, my private collection, and that of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The characters observed during my study of material in Europe, which I found to be of the greatest taxonomic importance, I enumerated in a paper which is printed in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy for 1864, p. 224. The use then made of those characters has been generally accepted by subsequent writers.!| There are, however, many other characters whose value is of uncertain taxonomic value, which were not then mentioned, and which I now record.
The first description of the osteology of the Sauria is that of Cuvier, which is contained in his Ossemens Fossiles.° This is an excellent one, but the many types discovered since his time render it neces-

sary that a new survey of the subject should be made. In 1856 the Zootomie der Amphibien, by Stannius, appeared. The account of the osteology of lizards given in this work is more complete than that of Cuvier, but it is incomplete in many points, and is not up to the requirements of the present time. The present study is made with especial reference to the necessities of the paleontology of the order, therefore the description of characters is made as specific as possible. The principal novelty will be found in the references to North American genera and in the descriptions of the hyoid apparatus. The deseription of the scapular and pelvic arches in certain genera with the extremities degenerate or wanting, where they have not been previously described, is contained in a separate illustrated paper, which has been published.!
Skull.—The premaxillary bone is single, except in the Scincidie, Acontiide, and some Geckonidz (Phyllurus sp.). It is very small in the Iguanid genus Phrynosoma, and in the Agamidz it is excluded from contact with the vomer by processes of the maxillaries, which meet on the middle line. In the Chameleonide the premaxillary is still smaller, the body being narrower than the superior spine, and supporting but one tooth. In the Anguide the premaxillary is bounded posteriorly on each side by a foramen which is sometimes large, but is wanting in other families, including the Helodermidx. In Lepidosternum it is principally on the inferior face of the muzzle. The nasal bones are generally distinct, but in the Varanidze they are fused into a single narrow median element. In the Chameleonidze they do not attain the nasal border, being cut off by the junction of the prefrontal with the _ premaxillary and maxillary bones. Im the genus Feylinia the nasal bones are fused into a broad plate. In Lepidosternum they are completely cut off from the nasal border by the maxillary, which is broadly in contact with the premaxillary spine. In Rhineiira the nasal bone reaches the nares, as in Amphisbena. The frontal bones are separate in the Varanide, Helodermide, Anguide, Scincide, Anelytropside, Anniellide, and Amphisbeenidie, and in some Geckonidxe. They are coossified in some Geckonide; in the Iguanidwe, Agamidw, Xenosauride, Eublepharidi, Chameleonidie, and Teiide. The parietals are generally fused, the only exception being the Geckonidx, Uroplatide, and Xantusiide. Prefrontals are always present, and in Anniellide, Helodermidwe, and Chamieleonid they extend posteriorly to the postfrontals, excluding the frontal from the orbital border. Lachrymals are present, but they are fused with the prefrontal in the Scincide. The jugal is generally present, even when there is no postorbital arch, as in Geckonidw, where it is a splint; but in the Amphisbzenia, Annielloidea, and in Feylinia, the splint-like element attached to the maxillary extends to the pterygoid posteriorly and the prefrontal anteriorly, and may include the lachrymal. The jugal extends anteriorly as far as the lachrymal except in the Scincid. The postfrontal

<<<Page: 209>>>

is wanting and in most cases is fused with the postorbital in the Varanide and Agamidie; but in other families it is distinct, with sporadic cases of fusion, as in Onemidophorus. Superciliary bones are present in Varanus, Phrynosoma, and several genera of Agamidz. They belong to the tegumentary system, and articulate the anterior with the prefrontal, the posterior (absent in Varanus) with the postfrontorbital bone. The supraoccipital is undivided and forms the superior part of the edge of the foramen magnum. Its anterior border is generally loosely articulated with the parietal, joining it by a rudimental or developed median gomphosis with the supraoccipital process. It is generally overhung by the parietal, always so when the parietoquadrate arches are present. It is entirely overroofed by the parietal in the Xantusiide, the two elements being connected by a vertical laminiform septum. It is not overhung in the Annielloidea and Amphisbzenia, and in these the articulation is a firm complete transverse union. The parietoquadrate arch consists proximally of a process of the parietal, which is directed outward and posteriorly, which may represent the supramastoid element of the primitive Cotylosauria. Distally this process receives an ascending process of the paroccipital on its inferior aspect, sometimes anteriorly, sometimes posteriorly. This arch is shortened and depressed in the Anelytropside and is absent from the Anniellide and Amphisbeenia. In the Chameleonid it is differently composed, consisting of a superior posterior process of the supratemporal, which rises upward and reaches the produced apex of the undivided parietal. The supratemporal is accompanied for a short distance above the quadrate by the ascending process of the paroccipital. The pineal foramen is present in the Chameleonide, Agamide, Iguanidie, Anolide, Xenosauridx, Anguide, Lacertid, Varanide, and Scincide. Itis wanting in the Helodermide, Eublepharide, Teiide, Anniellidee, and in the Amphisbeenia. It perforates the parietal bone clear of all sutures in most of the families, but it is near to or on the frontoparietal suture in Iguanide and Anolide, and is in the frontal in Dipsosaurus and the Chameleonide. The occipital condyle is compound, consisting of portions of the exoccipitals and basioccipital. In many genera these segments become so thoroughly codssified at maturity as to be undistinguishable. In some of the Geckonid (as Gecko, Uroplates) the occipital segment is so reduced as to give the appearance of two condyles. In the Amphisbenia the condyle is transverse and concave at the center, leaving the lateral portions prominent.
The postorbital bone when present sends a process posteriorly to the supratemporal, forming the supratemporal arch. In the genera without this arch the postorbital may be wanting, as in Heloderma, or be rudimental, as in Anniella. In the genera whose degeneration is advanced the supratemporal bone is appressed to the parietal, inclosing no foramen supratemporale, asin Feylinia. Inlimbless genera of Anguidze

<<<Page: 210>>>

the supratemporal touches the parietal anterior to the paroccipital, thus reducing the supratemporal foramen. This occurs also in Gerrhonotus, Celestus, Xenosaurus, and Xantusiide. In Heloderma the supratemporal is a rudiment on the external side of the base of the paroccipital.
The remarkable upward production of the supratemporal in Chameleon has been mentioned. Here this process takes the place of the parietoquadrate arch. The exoccipitals are produced laterally, each embracing, with the petrosal in front, the small paroccipital. This sustains the superior extremity of the quadrate. In the snake-like genera, as Feylinia, Anniella, and the Amphisbenia, this lateral elongation does not exist. The exoccipital is snake-like, and the quadrate is sessile on the side of the skull. The quadrate is generally convex at the upper part of its anterior face, and its external anterior border is produced outward so as to embrace a longitudinal concavity or conch, with the vertical mass or column of the bone. This column is itself more or less concave, its upper extremity being produced a little backward. In the Iguanidee there is another concavity, internal to the column, similar to the external. This is much narrowed in the majority of the families, and in the Varanide and Helodermide, and in Phrynosoma, Eublepharis,-and Celestus itis wanting. In Chameleon, Anniella, and the Amphisbeenia there is no external conch, the quadrate being simply a rod, while in Feylinia it is flattened in an antereposterior plane. The mandibular articulation is more or less bilobate in all except Varanus, where itis plane. In Gecko the bilobation is strongiy marked, as in the Permian Theriodonta. The pterygoid bones extend forward from the quadrates, with which they are in contact in all forms except Chameleon, toward the middle line. This portion is generally grooved, but in Yenosaurus itis a slender rod. They are received on the basipterygoid processes of the sphenoid, and then diverge and assume alongitudinal position without meeting onthe middle line. They are produced in an angle or process toward the posterior extremity of the maxillary bone, from which they are separated by the ectopterygoid. The pterygoids then join the palatines. Inafew genera they bear a few small teeth. The palatines are separate from each other and from the maxillaries, but send a process outward and forward to the latter. They join in front each its corresponding half of the vomer. The internal nares are situated each between the vomer and the maxillary, and it notches more or less deeply the palatine, which forms its posterior border. The vomers are separate in all forms excepting Chameleon, and they have various ‘orms. In Geckonidie and Anolide they are flat and fit closely together, and they have the same character in many Agamide and Iguanide. In a few members of these families (Uromastiz and Sauromalus) they are divided by a groove, which becomes a fissure posteriorly, which is the character in most other lizards. In the Varanid each vomer is produced posteriorly on each side this fissure toa greater distance than in other forms. The planes of the palate differ much in different families and groups. Thus, the vomer

<<<Page: 211>>>

is on a much higher plane than the palatines in Chameeleonide and Geckonide, the palatines curving downward to meet the pterygoids. The latter are generally horizontal, but in Chameleon they are in a subvertical plane, their free rounded extremities descending and fitting on the inner side of the mandible. They do not quite reach the quadrate. In the Agamide, Iguanidie, and Geckonidew the internal extremity of the ectopterygoid is directed inferiorly, forming a downwardly directed angle on each side of the palate. In the Amphisbenia the structure of the palate is much more compact than in other lizards. The palatines are in contact on the middle line and there is no palatomaxiilary foramen. That is, the palatine is in close contact with the maxillary, the ectopterygoid being. tightly wedged in between them. The pterygoids are in contact throughout their length with the sphenoid, and the proximal end of each is tightly wedged between the latter and the quadrate.
The character of the petrosal must be attended to by anyone who desires to understand the relations of the Sauria among themselves. In no member of the Sauria is the trigeminus foramen closed anteriorly by bony tissue, but it is inclosed by the membrane which forms the anterior wall of the brain case. The petrosal is divided into two parts by the deep notch whose fundus forms the posterior border of this foramen, which may be called the supra and infra foraminal portions. The infraforaminal portion is divided in most of the families by a longitudinal, keel-like ridge, which forms the superior border of a groove whose inferior wall is formed by the sphenoid. This groove is not present in Heloderma and is very shallow in Xenosaurus. It is wanting in the Anniellidw and Amphisbenia. In the Geckonide it does not exist, nor is the petrosal notched by the foramen, while the anterior border of the petrosal forms a free crest which extends from above downward and backward. In the Chaineleonide, Agamid, Iguanidz, and Anolidz (families with papillose tongues) the supraforaminal part of the petrosal is short and is bounded by a convex anterior border which marks the position of the anterior semicircular canal. In the Nyctisaura, Thecaglossa, Diplogiossa, Leptoglossa, and Amphisbenia (families with smooth or squamous tongues, except Anniella, Diploglossa, and Nyctisaura) the petrosal is produced beyond this curved border below the parietal. In many forms an outline of the semicircular canal which forms the boundary in the other superfamilies may be traced, whence I have termed this part of the petrosal posterior to it “the arched body” in my former system of the Sauria.' The petrosal is produced farthest beyond this arcade in the snakelike forms of the Anniella aud Amphisbzenia, reaching almost to the orbit in Lepidosternum. The relation to the parietal differs, the differences resulting from the greater or less reduction of the primitive supratemporal roof and the greater or less entrance of the parietal into the lateral wall of the brain case. In most of the families it is little or not decurved to

<<<Page: 212>>>

meet the petrosal; and in the Iguania, where it is decurved, it does not come in contact with the petrosal, owing to the shortness of the latter. In certain families where the petrosal is produced beyond the arcade, and the parietal is decurved, the two elements are in contact for a short distance, as in the Varanidz. In the Teiid and Scincide the contact is mainly effected by a short descending process of the parietal. This process is especially elongate in the Scincide. The arcade is the anterior border of the petrosal in the Permian Theriodonta, and it marks the position of the anterior semicircular canal. The membranous wall of the brain case, anterior to the petrosal, contains an ossification which is of uncertain homology. It reaches or approaches by its superior extremity the frontal, and might hence be supposed to be the orbitosphenoid; but this homology is vitiated by the fact that its inferior portion passes behind the optic foramen. The latter position is that of the alisphenoid, and so the bone is named by Parker!. But there is another element, the epipterygoid, posterior to it and immediately anterior to the petrosal, which has been supposed to be the true alisphenoid.
Leaving this question, and adopting for the bone in question the provisional name of postoptic, | remark that it is typically triradiate, sending two branches upward and one downward. This is its character in Agamidez, Varanide, and Teiide. The posterior superior branch is much reduced in many Iguanidie and Lacertidze and in some Agamidz (Megalochilus), and it is absolutely wanting in Gerrhosaurus and Chameleon. There is no postoptic in Heloderma. In the Rhynchocephalian genus Sphenodon these two elements coexist with an orbitosphenoid, lying between the optic and trigeminal foramina. The two together may be homologous with the mammalian alisphenoid. The epipterygoid is present in all Lacertilia excepting the Chamzleonidxe and Annulati (Amphisbenia). Its superior connections are quite characteristic of the different families. Inferiorly it rests on the pterygoid posterior to its ectopterygoid process, excepting in the Geckonide, where its point of attachment is opposite to that process. In the same family it does not reach the parietal, but the superior extremity rests on the apex of the supraforaminal part of the petrosal. In the remaining families there are three modes of superior attachment. In most of the [guania and Acrodonta it reaches the parietal and does not touch the short petrosal. In the other superfamilies it is in contact with the petrosal. Inthe Varanidie, Helodermide, and most Anguide it reaches the parietal, which does not meet it with a conspicuous descending process. In Scincide and Teiide a conspicuous descending process meets it. In a certain number of genera of various families it does not quite reach the parietal. Such are Eublepharide, Gerrhosauridie, Anguis, Lacerta, Phrynosoma (where it rests on the areade of the

petrosal), Iguana, Uromastix, Agama, and Gonyocephalus (subcristatus). In Lyriocephalus and Phrynocephalus the epipterygoid is very short.
The semicircular canals perforate the supraoccipital, the exoccipital, and the petrosal. The internal is in a subtransverse vertical plane, causing a convexity on the internal side of the supraand exoccipitals, and in some types a visible rib on the superoexternal suface of the same. The external canal is in a horizontal plane and perforates the base of the exoccipitopetrosal suspensorium, causing a horizonta: rib on the anterior face of the latter in some forms. The anterior is in a vertical anteroposterior plane, and perforates principally the petrosal, occupying its anterior border, which forms the ‘“ arcade” in most of the thick-tongued superorders, but crossing the bone much behind the anterior border in the slender-tongued superorders and the Diplogiossa. The fenestra ovalis is tightly closed by the disk of the stapes, which is continued externally as the rodlike columella. This rod is slender except in Anniella,where it is remarkably robust. In the other Amphisbenia its tympanic extremity is somewhat thickened. The columella is continued externally into a cartilage,which is more or less expanded in the vertico-transverse plane, the distal portion always so, forming a vertical lamina in contact with the tympanic membrane. This is the epistapedial cartilage. It is frequently produced upward beyond its point of attachment into a suprastapedial process. The plate thus formed is almost separate from the proximal axial part of the cartilage in Heloderma The axial portion has a descending process, the infrastapedial of Parker, in Lacerta, Heloderma, but not in Hublepharis, Thecadactylus, and Phyllodactylus.
The rami of the lower jaw are united at the symphysis by ligament only. The angle is a prolongation of the articular bone; it is elongate and simple, except in Anniella and Chameleon, where it is absent. The angular bone never reaches the angle, and has an anterior position, being sometimes fused with the articular. The relations of the segments of the lower jaw are very characteristic in the divisions of the Sauria. The splenial bone is wanting in the Chameleonide, and is very small in the Agamid; in other families it is well developed. The dentary extends posteriorly on the external face of the ramus, as the splenial diminishes, having the greatest posterior extent in the two families mentioned. The coronoid is differently extended in a similar ratio. Thus it is extended posteriorly on the external side of the ramus, and not anteriorly, in the Chamleonide and Agamide; both forward and backward in the Geckonide; and forward in the other families. The angular is absent (fused with the articular, Boulenger) in the Geckonide, Anolide, Acontiidwe, Anelytropsid, Anniellide, and the Annulata, and is distinct in all other families. The articular and surangular are fused in several genera of Iguanide; and there are but three bones in the ramus of Xantusia, which see. The
‘Memoirs, National Academy of Sciences, III, 1884.

<<<Page: 214>>>

angular extends well anteriorly on the interior border of the jaw in this order, but is differently developed on the inner and outer faces. The Chameleonidze and Agamid again show their similarity in having this element chiefly exposed on the interior side, while in other types the exposure is external. The Meckelian groove is open in the Chameeleonide, Agamidz, and Varanidie, but is roofed over more or less completely in all other families,
The hyoid system is not connected with the skull except in Geckonide, Eublepharidie, and Lepidophyma, so far as I have examined them. Thus in Thecadactylus, Phyllodactylus, and Eublepharis the ceratohyal is continuous with a cartilage which projects from the paroccipital above the posterior part of the auditory meatus. In Lepidophyma the free epibranchial is attached to the inferior lateral angle of the basioccipital. In forty-two genera of other families enumerated below this is not the case. In no genus have I discovered any connection with the stapedial cartilages. The hyoid system in lizards consists of a glossohyal which is continuous with a basihyal tract, a hypohyal often continuous with the basihyal tract, a ceratohyal, a first ceratobranchial, and a second ceratobranchial which is always continuous with the basihyal tract. There may be in addition an epibranchial, which belongs to the first ceratobranchial. In some genera there is a free epibranchial, which may be then closely approximated to the ceratohyal (Humeces, Oligosoma, Gerrhonotus), or to the second ceratobranchial (Lacerta, Xantusia, Lepidophyma). The only constantly ossified element is the first ceratobranchial. The genera and families differ in the presence or absence of the second ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and the proximity or separation of the former. In general the Varanide, Anguide, Zonuride, Gerrhosauridie, Scincide, Lacertide, and Xantuslide have epibranchials, while the thick-tongued and most degraded types are without them. In the Teiidze the hypobranchials are much produced anteriorly beyond the bases of the ceratohyals, and there are no second ceratobranchials. In Anguidz the hypobranchials are also greatly produced forward, but carry the ceratohyals with them. Ceratobranchials of the second pair are also wanting in Varanide, Helodermide, Chameleonide, Anguide, Anniellide, and Rhineiira; Phyllodactylus, Thecadactylus, and Gecko, among Geckoniwe; and Egernia, and Gongylus in Seincide. Ceratohyals are wanting in Chameleon, Anguis, Anniella, and Annulata generally. In both Agamide and Iguanide the second ceratobranchials are separated from each other in the depressed genera of terrestrial habits, and in close contact with cach other in those of arboreal habits; but they are in close contact in Callisaurus and Crotaphytus, both terrestrial genera. In Calotes, Iguana, and Anolis they act as the rim on which the gular pouch or fan is stretched. The characters of Saurian hyoids may be tabulated as follows: Most of the genera referred to are figured in Plates III to VI.

Vertebral column.—Except in the families of the Geckonidz and Uroplatide, the vertebral centra are proceelous. In the families named they are amphicelous. The zygosphen articulation is present in the Teiide and the larger Iguanide, including a rudiment in Crotaphytus. In smaller Iguanide (Sceloporus, Phrynosoma) and in Sauria generally this kind of articulation is wanting. In a good many families the caudal vertebre are divided by a transverse fissure or suture in front of the middle, which often splits the base and sometimes the length of the diapophysis. Such a structure is seen in Iguanide (Iguana, Sauromalus, Sceloporus, Dipsosaurus), Anolide, Anguide (Celestus), Teiide (Tupinambis, Cnemidophorus), Lacertidee (Lacerta), and Scincide (Gongylus, Humeces). In Dipsosaurus, Anolis, and Lacerta the neural spines of the caudal vertebre are double; in the other genera named, single. In Varanidee, Helodermidie, Gerrhonotus, Crotaphytus, and Phrynosoma, the caudal centra are undivided, and the neural spines are single. In Ophisaurus the centra are undivided and the neural spines double. The centra are excessively thin in Ophisauwrus, so that they break more readily than they disarticulate. There are two sacral vertebree except in genera with the posterior limbs rudimental or absent. In some of these, however, especially the degenerate genera of the Anguide, the rudimental ilium is attached to two diapophyses which join each other distally.
Intercentra are present in the cervical and caudal regions in the latter, supporting the chevron bones. Besides the intercentra there

<<<Page: 216>>>

are inferior processes of the cervical centra in some forms, the hypapophyses of Owen. These have been confused with the intercentra by Boulenger, and have been renamed catapophyses by Baur.'
The first dorsal vertebra is that one which is first connected with the sternum bya hemapophysis. In genera with a well-developed sternum the number of vertebre anterior to the first dorsal is eight, except in the Varanus niloticus (Cuvier) and V. griseus, where it is nine. In the extinct Dolichosauria of the Cretaceous period the cervical vertebre are Stated by Owen to number seventeen.
The number of ribs attached to the sternum diminishes with the reduction of the limbs, from the normal of four on each side to one, and total disconnection. A common hemapophysis or “xiphoid rod” succeeds these on each side, which gives attachment to two separate haemapophyses for ribs. The common hemapophysis is a segmentation of the anterior part of the fifth hemapophysis, and it is not distinct in some genera, as, Sauromalus. In Heloderma the fifth hamapophysis has no sternal segment or connection, and the sixth is wanting. In Varanus the fourth, fifth, and sixth are wanting. In genera with the two appendicular hemapophyses they are closely appressed on the middle line in the majority of the genera, but in genera of depressed form they are separated, often widely. They are separated in Stenodactylus guttatus, in Phymaturus, Crotaphytus, and Sceloporus. They are more widely separated in Dipsosaurus, and most widely in Sauromalus and Phrynosoma. Cervical ribs are present in varying numbers, and the posterior ones are generally quite elongate. In certain genera and families the ribs posterior to those attached to the sternum have their heemapophyses fused on the middle line below, thus constituting a series of abdominal ribs. In the IJguanid genus Scartiscus there are two such ribs. In the Anolide there are four and five pairs; in the Polychroine Iguanidz there are seven to ten. In the Chameleonidze and Geckonide there are several pairs. The ribs of Lepidosternum are remarkable for the presence of a capitular process which has no distinet capitular articulation.
Scapular arch.—The clavicle is present in all the families except the Chameeleonide, and in certain genera with degenerate fore limbs. In such genera it is the last portion of the scapular arch to remain, and it is the only element present in Feylinia (Anelytropside). It is always osseous. The form of its proximal extremity varies in the different families. It is simple in the Nyctisaura, Uroplatoidea, Acrodonta, Iguania, Diploglossa, and Thecaglossa, and expanded and generally perforate in the other superfamilies where present, except in some degenerate genera where it is simple (see Plate LI, fig. 2). In Trachysaurus and Cophias its proximal end is dilated, but not perforate. The scapula varies in form from elongate to short and wide. It presents a

<<<Page: 217>>>

proscapular process in many families and genera. It is present in Iguania and Nyctisaura, in the last named often decurved and acuminate, and in Lophura, in Acrodonta. It is present among Leptoglossa in Onemidophorus, and in some Ameivie, while in other Ameive it is wanting. It is wanting generally in Acrodonta, Diploglossa, Thecaglossa, and Leptoglossa, but it is present in Celestus striatus. It is wanting in Rhiptoglossa. The coracoid is extended anteriorly to the sternum, and it is generally deeply emarginate on its anterior interior border. These emarginations are closed by the procoracoid, which extends to the middle line, and is only partially or not at all ossified. There are two coracoid emarginations in most Iguania, exceptions being the terrestrial genera Urocentrum, Sceloporus, and Phrynosoma, and the Anolidxe. There are also two in Varanide and Teiide. The Agamide generally have but one, but Uromastix is an exception. There is but one in Anguidee and Scincide (two in Tiliqua), and none in Helodermidz and Chameleonide.
The interclavicle is a very characteristic element in the Sauria. It is wanting in Chameleonide and in some genera with fore limbs rudimental or absent. It is a simple splint in Helodermide and some degenerate genera. In other families it has a transverse limb on each side, which may be anterior, producing the ‘“‘anchor-shaped” form, or median, producing the “cruciform” type. It isanchor shaped in Acrodonta, Iguania, and Thecaglossa, and cruciform in Diploglossa and Leptoglossa. In Nyctisaura it is cruciform, with the lateral processes wide at the base. The sternum is a broad subrhombie plate which articulates by its anterolateral borders with the precoracoid and coracoid, and by its posterolateral borders with the ribs. In genera with well-developed limbs its principal differences are seen in the nature of its fontanelles when present. In the Agamidz there are two, and in most Iguanide there is one. Exceptions are the genera Polychrus Sauromalus, and Dipsosaurus, where there is no fontanelle. There is none in the Anolid. In Teiide and Lacertide itis present, but in Scincid it is mostly absent, exceptions being the North American species of Eumeces. The fontanelle is wanting in Geckonide, Diploglossa, Helodermatoidea, Thecaglossa, and Leptoglossa, with the exceptions above noted. The single median fontanelle is frequently concealed by the median limb of the interclavicle. It is nearly divided in some species of Sceloporus. |
The pelvic arch.—It is characteristic of the Sauria that the ilium is directed upward and posteriorly, and that the obturator foramina are well developed. The latter are only separated from each other by ligament or cartilage, which may sometimes contain some lime salt. It is produced posterior to the ischia in a triangular process, and less frequently into a similar one-in front of the pubic symphysis. The pubic foramen is always present. The pectineal process is present

except in Geckonide, but it is rudimental in some forms, as Phrynosoma. The following table shows the forms of the pubis in twenty-three genera of different families:

There is a tuber ischii in all of the genera which have come under my observation except Varanus. In Heloderma and some other forms it is small.
The anterior limb.—The humerus is much alike in all Sauria, Chameleon only presenting peculiarities. The proximal end is expanded neariy in one plane, and the middle portion of the flattened extremity forms the oval head. This is not distinctly isolated, except by the presence of articular surface, from the greater and lesser tuberosities which occupy the angles of the expansion. The shaft betrays no twist. The distal end is chiefly occupied by the condyles; but there are epicondyles, of which the internal is the more prominent, except in Chamceleon, where they are wanting. The condyles consist of an external rib and a medio-internal roller, which is generally bounded at the internal extremity by a tuberosity, which is, however, wanting in Chameleon. The ulna articulates with the median roller, its external edge being beveled by the external rib. The head of the radius articulates with the external rib, having shifted from its primitive position on the inner side. It results from this that in pronation the radius crosses the ulna. There is a short olecranon, except in Chameleon. The ulna and radius have about an equal share in the carpal articulation, sometimes the ulna a little the greater.
The constitution of the carpus is very uniform in Sauria, with ‘developed anterior limbs, the principal diversity being displayed by the Chamezleonid. In all, we have in the proximal row three distinet elements—the radiale, intermedium, and ulnare (= pisiforme), the latter mainly external to the ulna and directed posteriorly. Distal to the radiale and intermedium, and between them and the carpalia of the

<<<Page: 219>>>

second row, is a single small centrale. There are five carpalia, each corresponding to a metacarpal. I have failed to find in any of the genera at my disposal any of the carpalia fused together or wanting. In Chameleon, on the contrary, Cuvier has shown that there is no ulnare, and that the centrale and carpalia are fused into a single round median piece, to which the metacarpals are articulated. In all the normal Sauria the tendons of the flexors of the digits are combined on the palm, and the point of junction is occupied by a large flat sesamoid bone. The number of phalanges is also remarkably uniform. They number in each digit, commencing with the pollex, 2-3-4-5-3. The sole exception in the genera with well-developed extremities is Chameleon, where the numbers are 2-3-4-4-3. This genus differs also from other forms in the shapes of the metacarpals. Normally they are cylindric and subparallel in position and united in a common integument; but in Chameleon they are flattened, with expanded extremities, and divided into two bundles by a fissure, three within and two without, enabling the three inner digits to oppose the two outer round a branch of a tree. The number of digits in Sauria is normally 5-5, but reductions take place presenting variations from 4-5 to 1-1, the posterior limb usually displaying a lesser degree of degeneracy than the anterior, although not always.
Posterior linb.—The femur differs from the humerus in having a distinct head, which is marked off from a trochanter. The former is not hemispherical as in Mammalia, but is somewhat compressed, and is oval in section. The trochanter is on the inferior anterior side of the head, or in the position of the little trochanter of the mammalian femur. There is no great trochanter nor third trochanter. The condyles of the femur are not as well defined as in the Mammalia, and the patellar groove is represented by a shallow concavity without lateral ridges. Patella none, with some exceptional rudiments, as, for example, in Varanus. In Chameleon all the prominent features of the femur are toned down, the trochanter being represented by aridge. The fibula is more slender than the tibia, and is larger distally than proximally, the reverse of what obtains in the tibia. The latter has no crest.
Like the carpus, the tarsus is very uniform in the Sauria, the sole important modification being exhibited by the Chamieleonid. There are two fused proximal elements, which are probably tibiale-intermedium and fibulare. They are only distinct in Heloderma among North American genera, but a trace of the suture is seen in Varanus. In most Sauria there is then but one bone of the proximal row, which is flat and wider than long. No centrale, and but two tarsalia, the third and fourth, the latter much the larger. The second metatarsal projects alongside of t. iii, so as to approximate the tibiale; its head is figured by Cuvier as a distinct bone, but he does not describe it as such. In Chameleon there is a single proximal tarsal element, which is not flattened as in other lizards, and this articulates with a single subglobular

<<<Page: 220>>>

tarsale, from which the metatarsals radiate.'. The phalanges number, like those of the anterior foot, 2-3-4-5-3, in ordinary Sauria, and 2-3-4-4-3 in Chameleonide.
The alimentary canal in the Sauria is not very highly specialized into distinct regions. There can always be distinguished stomach and small and large intestines, the former by its muscular walls and the intestines by their respectively different diameters. The stomach is always simple, and is curved to the right at the pylorus, though in some of the serpentiform genera the curve is very slight. The small intestine forms a sigmoid which forms a loop cephalad just distad of the liver. This sigmoid is rarely simple, but is generally plicated, frequently highly so. The large intestine may or may not be distinguished into colon and rectum. The latter is constricted off at its extremity from a cloaca, which has common orifice with a short common genital chamber immediately above it, into which enter the oviducts, usually at the extremity of two papille.
The liver is not subdivided except at its distal border. Its form differs in the different superfamilies and families, and it is more elongate and originates further posterior to the heart in the serpentiform genera in each. The gall-bladder is always situated at or within its posterior border, and not at a distance from it. Spleen and pancreas present.
The heart is not situated far posteriorly in any form, not even in the serpentiform. There is sometimes a second anterior aorta bow in front of the usual aorta root. A carotis communis issuing from the right aorta root. Anterior abdominal vein joining the renalis revehens near the posterior border of the liver, and forming with the portal vein the posterior cava. This vein passes through the liver, receiving numerous hepatic veins. Two anterior cardinals (jugulars) enter the sinus venosus with the postericr cava.
The Sauria have two lungs, excepting the Annulati, which have but one. These are situated behind and on each side of the alimentary canal opposite to that portion which immediately follows the heart, excepting in the Annulati, where the lung lies ventrad of the alimentary canal for part of its length at least. Trachea with or without
'Cuvier (Ossemens Fossiles, ed. 1836, p. 98) describes a distinct tibiale and fibulare in Chameleon, and figures them (pl. 245, fig.52). These are not represented by Boulenger (Proc. Zool. Soc., London, 1891, p. 118). They are, in fact, not distinct tarsal elements, but are the epiphyses of the tibia and fibula, such as exist also in Heloderma and other genera, The tibiale and fibulare are fused into a single element as in other Saurians.

<<<Page: 221>>>

bronchi, which, when present, are usually very short, but are elongate in the Thecaglossa. Laryngeal cartilages only specialized as to the terminal one which forms a pair of shell-like arytenoids, which bound the rima glottidis.
Testes single, situate well anterior to the cloaca. Ovaries occupying a corresponding position. Oviducts transversely plicate when empty, with nonplicate borders, and with fontanelle a little anterior to position of ovaries; orifice into vagina small; vasa deferentia convolute, adherent to kidneys. Kidneys posterior, symmetrical; ureters short. Urinary bladder generally present, but rudimental in some and absent in a few forms, as, for instance, the Teiide.
The male intromittent organ or hemipenis presents much variety of structure, showing some parallels to the corresponding part in the snakes. It is, however, rarely spinous, as is so generally the case in the Ophidia, the only spinous forms being, so far as I have examined, the American Diploglossine and genera allied to Cophias. The higher Sauria have the apical parts modified as in the Ophidia by the presence of calyculi. Such are characteristic of the Rhiptoglossa and Pachyglossa. The Nyctisaura possess the same feature. The Diploglossa, Helodermatoidea, and Thecaglossa have the organ flounced, the flounces often pocketed or repand on the margin. In the Leptoglossa we have lamine only; in the Teiidse mostly transverse, and in the Scincidz mostly longitudinal. In various genera terminal papille are present. The organ may be simple or bifurcate, or merely bilobate. I have not met with the case so common in Ophidia where the sulcus spermaticus is bifurcate and the organ undivided.
The structures of the hemipenis have a constant systematic value. As in the Ophidia, the value differs with the character, but it varies from generic to superfamily.
This includes the dermal, the mucous, and the serous structures. I give attention to the serous or peritoneal membrane, which presents a considerable variety of structure among the Sauria.
A fold suspends the alimentary canal from the median dorsal line forming the dorsal mesentery. No other mesenteries bind the canal, except the stomach, and sometimes an adjacent portion of the small intestines, which have other connections. The liver, on the other hand, has several mesenteric connections, as follows: Its ventral face has usually a single sheet connecting it with the median ventral line, but in rare instances it is bifurcate posteriorly (Trachysaurus), or even double (Tiliqua). This sheet, or one of them, is continued along to the anterior abdominal artery to the ventral wall, and sometimes along the gall duct to the pyloric part of the small intestine. Each border of the liver is concave above, in adaptation to the lungs, in the types where they extend so far posteriorly, which is the usual arrangement. The median portion of the liver is concave above, usually in adaptation to the stomach. From the left-hand ridge thus produced a sheet or mesentery extends to the stomach, forming the gastrohepatic mesentery. From the right-hand superior angle a mesentery extends to the right dorsal body wall, forming the right hepatic

<<<Page: 222>>>

mesentery. The three mesenteries now described are the only ones which are universally present which bind the liver. The following sheets are present in various types: Generally the right hepatic and the gastrohepatic give off sheets to the right and left lungs respectively, constituting the right hepatopulmonary and gastropulmonary mesenteries. A sheet occasionally goes off from the gastrohepatic to the left body wall, forming the left gastro-parietal mesentery. This is frequently represented by a narrow band, and occasionally, as in Dipsosaurus, it joins the small intestine just beyond the extremity of the gastrohepatic sheet. This is not represented on the accompanying diagram. In Heloderma a distinct sheet extends from the left border of the liver to the left body wall, forming the left lateral hepatic mesentery. In Polychrus and Anolis the left lung, instead of being attached to the gastrohepatic mesentery, is attached by a sheet to the left border of the liver, forming the left hepatopulmonary mesentery. In Varanus salvator there is a short median gastrohepatic sheet. In Varanus, owing to the anterior position of the lungs, they have no hepatic or gastric connections. In no Saurian have I observed a right hepatopulmonary sheet, as the right hepatic mesentery takes in the right lung in its course. The latter extends along the apical strip of the right lobe of the liver

to the genital mesentery in many genera. In Tupinambis, Dracaena, and some others the right hepatic extends as a strong sheet to the right body wall, forming, with an equally strong gastroparietal of the left side, a kind of diaphragm. In many genera the right hepatic sheet is connected with the stomach, especially at its proximal part.
Besides the hepatic and gastric mesenteries, there are those which inclose the internal genitalia, the urinary bladder, and the corpora adiposa. The genital mesentery is sometimes quite extensively free, and is always so anteriorly, especially where it supports the wide fontanelle of the oviduct. There is no mesentery of the corpora adiposa, and a pouch only in those cases where those bodies project freely into the abdominal cavity, as is frequently the case. The cystic mesentery is a transverse fold of the peritoneum which lines the inferior wall of the pelvic cavity, and which incloses the urinary bladder when it is present.
The integument of the Sauria is divided into scales of a great variety of structure. Some of them are ossified, and in such cases are traversed by canals (Scincide). Others are produced into acute apices, which are ensheathed by a very hard epidermis, which becomes formi

<<<Page: 223>>>

dable as a horny weapon. On the posterior part of the inferior face of the thigh in many genera the scales of one or rarely two rows are deeply fossate, and the foss are occupied by a waxy plug, which projects beyond the general level. The use of this substance is uncertain, but it is probably an important aid to the animal in maintaining its hold on smooth surfaces. Lizards which move on the ground rest much on the thighs, which are not elevated above the ground in many types, but serve as the principal point of contact from which they make their leaps. The same is true of some genera which leap among trees from branches and trunks. A similar secretion issues from the preanal scales in some Iguanide (Liolaemus, ete.), and in an African Lacertid a rudimental structure of this character is found on many of the abdominal scales (Poroidogaster). An approximation to this structure I have seen on the preanal scales of an adult male of Sceloporus horridus of Mexico. Here the epidermis is greatly thickened above the middle posterior part of the scale, so much so as to make a deep impression in the true skin, simulating a true preanal “pore.” I suspect that the nature of these structures is similar to that of corns in higher Vertebrata.
When the tails of lizards are fractured a cartilaginous rod is devel. oped from the centrum of the last vertebra remaining, on which muscles and integument appear. The scales are not similar to those of the normal tail, but resemble generally those of snakes, having a rhombic shape. Sometimes, as in various Scincidee and Geckonide, a series of transverse plates is developed on the under slde, which does not exist in the normal tail. According to Boulenger the new scales in Lacertide, Gerrhosauride, and scinc-like Anguide reproduce scales of the normal type. This author shows that in the Teiid genus Gymnophthalmus, which has scincoid scales, the reproduced scales of the new tail resemble those of the chalcidiform Teiidw, which are totally different. In Dopasia, which has Gerrhonotid scales, those of the reproduced tail are scincoid.!
Lizards which live in sandy deserts sometimes have the lateral scales _ of the digits produced into spines. These probably aid in securing a good foothold in the unstable surface. Such a structure appears in the Geckonid genus Ptenopus, of South Africa, in the Agamid genus Phrynocephalus, in Asia, and in the Iguanid genus Uma, in North America. This is an interesting example of homoplassy.?
The brain of Sauria may be distinguished as to external form from that of the Ophidia by the less posterior expansion of the prosencephalon, the hemispheres having about the same width posteriorly as the mesencephalon. In the Ophidia the hemispheres spread laterally behind so as to be wider than the mesencephalon. The rhinencephalon
! Boulenger, Proceedings, Zoological Society of London, 1888, p. 351. 2Cope, American Naturalist, XX VIII, 1894, p. 435.

<<<Page: 224>>>

is generally much more elongate than in the Ophidia, each consisting of a slender peduncle and distal hollow bulb. In the genus Gongylus, and probably in other Scincid, the olfactory process is not longer than in the Ophidia. The ventricles of the mesencephala are distinct from each other, and these bodies are also separate from each other, except at the base. The cerebellum (epencephalon) does not differ materially from that of the Ophidia except in the case of the Geckonide., In as many of the genera as have been examined this region is represented by two commissures covering the fourth ventricle instead of one, the usual number in vertebrata.
The epiphysis is large in Sauria, while it is rundimental in Ophidia. It extends to the superior cranial wall, and its investing membrane is oppressed, tympanum-like, to the parietal foramen. Its superior expansion contains a varying amount of pigment, according to the type, and a layer of cells, forming a cup-like structure with concavity upward. This structure has been supposed to be an organ of special sense allied to sight. It is present in various conditions in most members of the Sauria, but is more or less rudimentary in all. In some forms there is no axial nervous connection with the brain. It is not unlikely that this is a remnant of an organ of special sense which was functional in some of the extinct Reptilia. There is a very large parietal foramen in the Plesiosauride, and I have found it still larger in the Permian Cotylosaurian family of the Diadectidee. In a number of Reptilia a Similar median body has been discovered close by the epiphysis—the parepiphysis. It resembles the former, but is more rudimental.
The sacculus endolymphaticus of the internal ear sends upward a branch, which differs in its extent in the different families. In the Geckonide it extends to the neck and terminates in a sac on either side behind the auditory meatus. This sae is filled with a mass of lime salt similar to that which composes the otolites. This protuberance on the neck of these reptiles has excited not a little curiosity, and this feeling is rather stimulated than allayed by the knowledge of its direct connection with the organ of hearing.
From the center of multiplicity of forms of typical Sauria, we can pursue three series—one toward the serpents by Amphisbana, one to the partially degraded type of the Geckos, and lastly through the highest or pachygloss series, to Chameleon.
In the first case, the prolonged development of the superior part of the proétic is followed by a decurving of the parietal border, the closer attachment of the occipital sclerotome, and shortening of the supratemporal and paroccipital. Finally the petrosal, with the pieces adjoining anteriorly, begin to restrict a foramen ovale, the orbitosphenoid is developed, and the articular and angular pieces of the mandible are represented by but one piece; the columella disappears. In the last direction, the petrosal is not elongate, nor is there any tendency toward

<<<Page: 225>>>

a more complete closure of the cranial cavity. The inferior wing of the petrosal is directed inward instead of forward; the parietal fontanelle does not diminish, and the premaxillary bone is seen to form a regularly decreasing series. The interclavicle and columella diminish in length and disappear, and the splenial becomes smaller and smaller to extinction. The subarticular strengthens the inner rather than the outer wall of the mandible, and the external direction of the coronoid is reversed.
In approaching the Geckos, the bones of the palate are seen to be thinner and more expanded, and the articular piece of the mandible is lost. In the full type the ossification is of the lightest description, and the fascial and basement membranes often present incomplete deposits of bony tissue; thus the parietal and sternal fontanelles disappear. The parietals are not, as usual, united, and there is a diminution (in Uroplates nearly obliteration), of the median or basilar segment of the occipital condyle. There is a temporal ala peculiar to this suborder.
The following is a synopsis of the prevailing characters of the suborders.
The arrangement adopted in this work is in general that of my system published in 1864,! but I have subordinated the divisions somewhat differently. This consists chiefly in distributing the divisions of the group I then proposed under the name of Pleurodonta, and regarding them as of equal rank with the other three primary suborders— Pachyglossa, Nyctisaura, and Opheosauri. This distribution establishes five additional suborders, and two new ones are added, the Geccovarani and the Anguisauri. The former of these is based on characters brought out by Boulenger in his essay on the classification of the Sauria,’ the latter is made necessary by a different estimation of the characters I described in the memoir above mentioned. The number of suborders is thus eleven, and the families they embrace number twenty-two. For the characters of five of these families I am indebted largely to Boulenger.
As elsewhere, the orders and families of Sauria can not be arranged in a linear series. There are three lines whose terminal groups are the Chameeleontide, the Geckonide, and the Scincidz respectively, and between these most of the families can be arranged. The suborders and families are as follows:
I, Petrosal not produced anterior to semicircular canal and not articulating above with the parietal; olfactory lobes not underarched. Hemipenis mostly calyculate.

The extinct family of the Dolichosauride probably represents another super-family, but its characters are not well known. It is so far only known from the Cretaceous bed of Europe. The genus Dolichosaurus (Owen) is remarkable for the large number of cervical vertebra, there being not less than seventeen in the series.
Ill. PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONS.
The degradational tendencies of the Sauria have been already referred to, as especially exhibited in the reduction of the limbs. ‘This has been associated with a close adhesion to a life on the ground, and ultimately with a life beneath the surface of the ground. Coincidentally with this habit there has taken place a reduction in the efficiency of the sense of sight. The eyelids have disappeared and the epidermis has become thickened over the cornea, and has ultimately assumed the character of the epidermis of the other parts of the head and body. The corium has in some cases closed over the orbit, so that total blindness has resulted.
These reductions are seen least in families and genera of arboreal habits. No member of the Rhiptoglossa, Nyctisaura, Acrodonta, or Iguania displays any of them. They are first seen to a limited degree in the Diploglossa, while they are very common in the Leptoglossa, and universal in the Typhlophthalmi and Amphisbzenia. I give the following table which displays at once the degradational series of the limbs in the respective families in which it occurs. I also include some fusions of cephalic dermal plates.

Comparison of Diploglossa.—The degeneracy in this series is tolerably consistent in the order of its progress. In none of the genera are fore limbs present, and in three of them hind limbs are present. Notwithstanding the universal absence of fore limbs, a scapular arch is always present. This region shows, however, successive stages of degeneracy, as follows: In the three genera without posterior limbs the sternum has costal articulations; in the other three, none. In the genera with costal articulations the number of the latter diminishes regularly: in Mancus, three; in Opheodes, two; in Pygopus,one. Of the three genera with ccstal articulations, the interclavicle is present in two; in one (Pygopus) it is wanting. In the other genera it is present in a much modified form and position in one genus (Ophisaurus). Clavicles and coracoids are osseous in all of them; but the procoracoid is osseous in only two genera (Opheodes and Pygopus); while in the third genus with costal articulations (Mancus) it is cartilaginous, as in the genera without costals. The genera with costal articulations are also the only ones with osseous scapula. So we observe a certain order in the loss of parts. Thus, the part to disappear first is the interclavicle (to reappear in Ophisaurus); second, costal articulations and osseous scapula; third, sternum, which diminishes in size until greatly reduced, as in Anguis and -Dopasia.
As regards the pelvic arch, reduction of its elements precedes the loss of limbs. Thus, Mancus is the only genus where the pubis and ischium meet (or in the ischium, are connected by an osseous hypogastroid) on the middle line. In Opheodes, where the posterior limbs are much as in Mancus, these elements are separated below the pubes widely. In Pygopus, where the limbs are better developed than in either, the inferior pelvic elements are rudimental and widely separated, being merely processes of the ilium. In the genera without limbs (Ophisaurus with a minute rudiment) this reduction is carried still further, the inferior elements not being distinguished from each other or from the ilium, the entire arch having a lateral position. Miiller remarks of these parts in Pseudopus, Ophisaurus, and Anguis, that they are “zwar sehr tihnlich.” The order of degeneracy, then, in the pelvic appendages in the Diploglossa, is, first, reduction of inferior pieces; second, loss of limbs; third, fusion of all the elements into a single lateral bone.
Comparison of the Leptoglossa.—In Chalcides we have nearly normal scapular and pelvic arches, while the limbs are very much reduced, though not to be termed rudimental. In the next stage of reduction, where all the limbs are present, but rudimental, the two arches show a considerable degradation, which is more marked in the scapular than in the pelvic. The pelvic elements remain much as in Chaleides, but reduced in size merely. In the scapular arch the sternum loses two costals, and the interclavicle loses the transverse processes. The clavicles become simple, and the ossification of the scapula and coracoid is reduced in extent. In Propus, where the fore limbs are much as in

<<<Page: 230>>>

Hvesia, while the hind limbs have disappeared, the scapular arch has many points in common with Hvesia. Thus, the clavicle and interclavicle are simple, and the sternum has only two costals. The scapular and clavicle are much better ossified. On the other hand, the pelvic arch displays a great reduction. In Anelytropsis, appropriately to the absence of fore limbs, there is no scapular arch. The pelvic arch is greatly reduced; but, curiously, there appears an element which resembles a corresponding element in the snakes. This arrangement is quite different from anything observed in the other Leptoglossa or in the Diploglossa, but is not without parallel in other Sauria, to be described later on.
The reduction of the scapular elements proceeds in the Leptoglossa on much the same lines as observed in the Diploglossa. The early simplification of the distal end of the clavicle is peculiar to the Leptoglossa as it is always simple in the Diploglossa. The late stages of reduction of the sternum seen in the limbless Diploglossa are not exhibited by any of the forms here described, although they probably exist, since we have the Anelytropsis, where the scapular arch is wanting. On the other hand, the extreme reduction of the pelvis seen in Propus, where the ilium only remains, has not yet been observed in the Diploglossa without posterior limbs.
Observations on Annulatii—The wide diversity between the pelvic structure in Chirotes, as compared with that of Amphisbena, emphasizes the evidence furnished by the scapular arch in favor of regarding it as representing a family distinct from the Amphisbenide. Even with the pelvic elements of Chirotes before us, it is difficult to be sure of the homology of the corresponding part in Amphisbena and Rhineura. It can only be one of the two inferior elements, or femur. Against the latter supposition, which is suggested by the structure of the Anelytropidie, its anterior position is strong evidence. For the reason that it approximates closely the vent, its claim to be ischium is rather Stronger than the supposition that it can be pubis. It is homologized by Fiirbringer with the iliopectineal bone of the snakes.
General conclusions.—One conclusion is obvious, and this is that degeneracy of the scapular and pelvic arches follows degeneracy and loss of limbs, sooner or later. More special conclusions may be expressed as follows:
I. Anterior limbs have disappeared more generally than the posterior in the Diploglossa.
If. The limbs incline to degenerate and disappear more nearly pari passu in the Scincidie.
Ilf. The anterior limbs have a tendency to persist longer in the Teiide and Amphisbenide. Future research may not sustain this proposition.
IV. The degeneracy in the scapular arch is delayed long after the degeneracy and loss of the anterior limbs.
V. Degeneracy of the pelvic arch precedes the loss of the pelvic limb.

<<<Page: 231>>>

VI. The order of degeneracy of the elements of the scapular arch is (1) limb; (2) interelavicle (generally); (3) costal attachment; (4) sternum.
VII. The order of disappearance of parts in the pelvis is (1) pubis and ischium together (generally; see Amphisbena); (2) limb; (3) ilium.
The conclusion that the rudimental condition of the arches and limbs is due to degeneracy is supported by paleontologie evidence, which shows that the ancestral orders of the Reptilia (Cotylosauria and Theromora) had well-developed limbs. Similar evidence shows that the Sauria and Ophidia had a common ancestor; but, as already remarked, whether that ancestor was a Theromor or a Rhynchocephal remains uncertain.
Within the limits of the Sauria the series of affinities expresses in some degree the phylogenetic succession. We can express these in a tabular form as follows:
RHIPTOGLOSSA NycrisAvRA THECOGLOSSA LEPTOGLOSSA ANNULATA
This phylogeny presupposes that the superfamilies in which the petrous bone extends in advance of the anterior semicircular canal are of later origin, or were derived from those, in which this is not the case. It must be borne in mind, however, that this difference is of very ancient origin, since in the Permian epoch the Cotylosauria have the petrous bone developed forward, and the Pelycosauria have it much abbreviated. The Pythonomorpha of the Cretaceous also have the abbreviated petrosal in strong contrast to the existing Thecoglossa, where itis produced. Nevertheless the Pachyglossa display such affinities in many directions that they are probably ancestral to the other superfamilies. The dentition of the Agamidz is quite identical with that of many of the Rhynchocephalia, and with that of the Chameleons as well. It is a modification of the primitive rhizodont dentition which prevailed during the Permian. The pleurodont dentition is another modification which points to the Iguanidz as the starting point of the families which also possess that type of dentition.
The intermediary position of the Diploglossa between the thick and thin tongued lizards I pointed out in 1864, and its tendencies toward the Nyctisaura also are unmistakably seen in Xenosaurus. The Nyctisaura have degenerated in the characters of their vertebra, for I do not believe this character to be of primitive origin, or to indicate that the superfamily is related to the Permian Pelycosauria, which have Similar vertebre.

<<<Page: 232>>>

The Rhiptoglossa (Chameleons) form an extremely specialized type, modified from the Agamide by loss of parts and modification of the feet. Their cranial characters are in some respects not a little like those of the Laramie Dinosaurian family of the Agathaumide, but this resemblance does not indicate affinity. Finally, the Amphisbzenians (Annulati) are a group of whose origin it is difficult to learn. They may have come off from the common ancestors of the Sauria and Ophidia, but their resemblances to the Annielloidea render it possible that their point of origin may liave been later in the scale. Their dental types differ quite like those of the Pachyglossa, and it is therefore clear that they were not derived from a pleurodont type, but like the Pachyglossa developed a pleurodont type independently. The discovery by Baur of this superfamily in the American Oligocene shows it to have been contemporary with the Diploglossa, which I discovered in the same horizon. In any case the Annulati show a nearer tendency toward the Ophidia than any other group of the Sauria.
The suborder of Sauria was first correctly defined and distinguished from the other divisions of Reptilia by Owen in 1841, under the name of Lacertilia. Previous to this date the division which included it was either too comprehensive on account of the admission of the Loricata, or deficient by reason of the reference of the serpentiform lizards to the Ophidia. Indeed Laurenti in 1768 included lizards, crocodiles, and salamanders in a division which he termed Gradientia, for which reason this name is not available for any natural division of animals. Brogniart in 1799 first proposed the term Sauria, but included the crocodiles, as did Daudin (1802), Duméril (1806), and Oppel (1811). Merrem in 1820 first separated the crocodiles from other reptiles under the name Loricata, and retained Oppel’s name, Squamata, for the order as now generally adopted. The contents of the Squamata were, however, very incorrectly arranged and no progress was made in correctly distinguishing the Sauria from the Ophidia. Wagler in 1830 included the sealed reptiles in three groups, Lacertze, Serpentes, and Angues, excluding the crocodiles as Crocodili. The Angues includes both Saurian and Ophidian genera.
In 1834 Duméril and Bibron issued the first volume of the Erpétologie Générale. The crocodiles are included in the Sauria. In 1841 Owen proposed a system of Reptilia based on studies of both the extinct and recent forms. He did not recognize the order Squamata, but regarded the lizards and snakes as representing orders, using the names Lacertilia and Ophidia. For the crocodiles he employed the name Crocodilia instead of the older Loricata. It was reserved for Johannes Miiller to distinguish more exactly than his predecessors the Sauria from the Ophidia, his only error being the retention of the Amphisbenia (Annulati) in the latter. He wrote in 1837, and employed

<<<Page: 233>>>

the terms Sauria and Ophidia for the two divisions. Stannius in 1856 gave the first clear presentation of the contents of the Squamata in their natural relations. He embraced under the Sauria the three divisions, Amphisbenoidea, Kionocrania, and Chameleonida, which are the forms now generally included by authors in the suborder.
As regards the contents of the suborder, Wiegmann first gave in the Herpetologia Mexicana an intelligible system based on structural characters. His work formed the basis of the later ones of Duméril and Gray. The characters employed by these authors were, however, external. In 1864! the present writer published a synopsis of the osteological characters of the Sauria, and proposed a system based on them. I used the names given by previous authors for groups where, as is usually the case, the characters of the skeleton coincide with those indicated by the tegumentary structures and tongue. In 18961 reinforced these definitions by characters derived from the penial structures.”

Digits including metapodials in opposing groups of two and three about a centrale carpi and tarsi respectively. No clavicles. Tongue papillose, with sheathed extremity. Hemipenis calyculate.
Many other peculiarities characterize the lizards included in this superfamily, but they are not such as appear to me to characterize a division of such high rank, but to pertain rather to the definition of the single family which it includes.
Some authors think that the Sauria should be primarily divided into three divisions: the Chamzleonida (= Rhiptoglossa), Kionocrania (remaining Sauria), and Amphisbenia Boulenger divides the Squamata. into four primary divisions, of which the Rhiptoglossa forms one, and the others are the lizards, Pythonomorpha, and the snakes. These views are due to the importance attached to an aggregate of characters, each one of which can be shown to be of no wide systematic value in the Squamata. Thus the absence of epipterygoid characterizes forms not widely removed (some of the Leptoglossa) from those which possess it. The interclavicle is absent in the chameleons, but it experiences great reduction to extinction in somo other groups. Other characters will be mentioned under the family definition.

Boulenger,' in enumerating these characters, includes ‘‘vomer single” and “a supratemporal bone present” as of such importance as to require their separation as a suborder. The character ‘“‘vomer single” is, however, an error, as the ‘‘vomer” (= maxillopalatines) is paired as in other Sauria. What is here called vomer is the inferior spine of the premaxillary. The supratemporal is homologous with that found in nearly all other Sauria.
But one family of Rhiptoglossa is known, as follows:

This family possesses numerous peculiar characters besides those of the superfamily to which it has been referred. Some of these are found also in the Agamide. They are as follows:
Coronoid bone produced posteriorly on outside of ramus.
Articular present; separate from angular. Splenial reduced, more frequently wanting. Subarticular small on outer, much prolonged on inner face of ramus.
Groove from splenial to mental foramina not closed over Meckel’s cartilage.
Premaxillary nearly always separated from vomer by maxillaries.
Pterygoids not touching body of sphenoid or reaching quadrate.
Parietal single, receiving the gomphosis of loosely attached occipital segment internally. Trontals united.
Sternum without fontanelle.
No angular process of mandible.
Abdominal ribs present.
The viscera present the following peculiarities: The observations are made on Chameleon basiliscus and OC. planiceps. The liver is adjacent to the heart, and is compressed, so that the vertical diameter much exceeds the transverse. It is two-lobed, the left lobe much smaller in every way than the right. The gall bladder is entirely posterior to, but adjacent to, the liver. The alimentary canal exhibits stomach, small

intestine, colon, and rectum. The small intestine is short and little plicate, and the colon is short and has a cecum.
According to Stannius, the lungs are digitate at the extremity and along the inner borders. Wiedersheim states that the proximal part of the lung is shortly divided longitudinally into three parts, each of which has a separate connection with the bronchus.
The mesenteries include the usual hepato-ventral, epigastric, gastrohepatic, and right hepatic, the last including the right lung. The left lung is included in a left hepatogastric, a feature seen in few other eroups, notably as the Anoline Iguanid. There is also a left hepatolateral, from the liver to the left body wall, having a direction diagonal to the long axis of the liver in C. basiliseus.
The greater part of the surface of the hemipenis is coarsely calyculate, generally in a transverse direction. There are remarkable papille at the apex, which differ in the different forms. In the C. pardalis there is a kind of membranous apron proximad of the papilla, which presents an apex proximad opposite to the sulcus spermaticus. In the C. vulgaris and C. gracilis the papille are erect, laminiform, and transverse, and serrate on the edges. The principal pair have a few papille in front of and behind them, and in the @. gracilis there is behind these, on each side, an oval body which is composed of three serrate laminz packed obliquely together. In the C. gracilis the proximal lamin are low and have a margin of acute tubercles, and each serves as a collar to a much larger papilla. The latter is largely free and tongue-shaped, with the apex proximad, and its flat external surface is covered with three or four rows of conic papille.
Boulenger thus summarizes the general characters of the Chameleons:
Tongue cylindrical, extremely extensile and projectile, sheathed at the base, clubshaped and viscous at the end, with an exceedingly elongate glossohyal bone.
The head usually forms a bony casque, ornate with crests or tubercles. The interorbital septum is present, and a sma 1 columeila cranii distinguishable. (This is not the columella (epipterygoid), but the postoptic Cope.) Premaxillary extremely small, edentulous (sometimes. C.); orbit bony all around, the preand postfrontals often joining to form a supraorbital roof; a pair of supranasal fontanelles, bordered by the nasals, the prefrontals, and the frontal; latter bone single; parietal foramen, if present, pierced in the frontal; parietal single, often much narrowed and compressed, forming a crest, and meeting posteriorly the extremities of a pair of bones, the supratemporals, which on each side connect it with the squamosal. (This should be paroccipital. C.) In some species the parietal in the adult may be much expanded, and form a bony slab from which the supratemporals are no longer to be distinguished. Dentition acrodont; teeth compressed, triangular, more or less distinctly tricuspid. Palate toothless. Eyes large, covered by a thick granular lid pierced with a small central opening for the pupil. No tympanum. Body compressed; neck very short. Vertebre procelian. Abdominal ribs present. Limbs long, raising the body. Digits arranged in bundles of two and three; in the hand . the inner bundle is formed of three, the outer of two digits; it is the reverse in the foot. Tail prehensile. Head and body covered with granules or tubercles.
Physiologically as well as anatomically Chameleons stand by themselves among reptiles, as is evidenced by the mobility and independent action of their eyes, the projectility of their tongue, the slow and deliberate movement of their limbs. The

<<<Page: 236>>>

changeable hue of their skin, first noticed in them, is a peculiarity shared by many other lizards, and to an equal if not stronger degree by Calotes.
‘ About one-half of the species occur in Madagascar and neighboring islands, the other half in Africa; the common Chamieleon is Mediterranean, occurring in Europe, however, only in Andalusia; a species inhabits Socotra, another South Arabia, and a third India and Ceylon.

Siebenrock! has described the osteology of the Brookesia superciliaris Kuhl, which he shows possesses a number of peculiarities which distinguish it from the species of the genus Chameleon, and, in fact, from all known genera of Vertebrata. From the fourth cervical vertebra to the eighteenth caudal, inclusive, the zygapophyses of each side are connected by a longitudinal osseous bar. This bar gives origin on the dorsal vertebrie to a transverse process which is above the true transverse process and more prominent. It is called by Siebenrock “ accessorischer querer Fortsatz,” which may be classicized into epidiapophysis. Further, the prezygapophyses are connected by a bony arch which is fused on the middle line with the neural spine, on the dorsal vertebrae, from the second to the ninth, inclusive. In the cranium the frontal and parietal are greatly expanded. ‘The former reaches the orbit, excluding the preand postfrontals. The parietal excludes the occipital from view when seen from above. There are teeth on the premaxillary bone.
In the genus Chameleon the prefrontals and postfrontals exclude the frontal from the orbit. The vertebrie aré normal.
In spite of the peculiarities of the RKhiptoglossa I supposed that they were derived from the Pachyglossa. Many of their characters are present in generaof the Agamide, leaving but few to be accounted for, as of later and separate origin. Of the latter kind are the peculiarities of the external nostrils, and metapodials. The characters of the premaxillary, mandibular composition and scapular arch are nearly approached or imitated by some of the Agamidie; and in some of the latter the epipterygoid becomes much abbreviated.

lous. Clavicle simple proximally. Interclavicle anchor-shaped. Pre-
maxillary undivided. Parietal single, receiving the loosely articulated occipital inferiorly. Frontal not underarching olfactorylobes. Tongue papillose, the apex not retractile.
As to the visceral anatomy, the following points are characteristic:
Liver short and contracted proximally or semipyriform, the posterior border more or less emarginate by one or sometimes two notches; the right lobe more produced than the left, and terminating in a narrow strip which reaches the reproductive cells. Gall bladder partly exposed on the posterior margin.
Alimentary canak with stomach, small intestine, and rectum well distinguished, and also a short colon adjacent to the rectum, which frequently presents a short, proximal cecum. Corpora adiposa free anteriorly. Kidneys posterior in position; a urinary bladder. Ventral mesentery extending to posterior border of liver and beyond it to a fold of the small intestine.
This superfamily embraces the most vigorous branch of the order and includes the largest species, excepting the Thecaglossa. Its point of contact with the other superfamilies is through the Diploglossa, and especially the Zonuridz. In my first system of the Sauria I divided the Pachyglossa, as had been done by others, into two superfamilies, and associated one of them with the Chameleonide, and the other with the Leptogloss and Diplogloss superfamilies. This was because I had discovered numerous osteological characters which appeared to justify this arrangement. It is, however, clear that, as various authors have shown, the Chameleonidz represent a distinct superfamily. I am of the opinion also that the points of agreement which I have discovered in the anatomy of the acrodont and pleurodont divisions of the Pachyglossa are more important than the differences, and as these points are of the exact grade which define the superfamilies, I return to the system of Wagler and Fitzinger, pointing out at the same time the various osteological characters in which the pleurodont division agrees with other lizards and differs from the acrodont division.

In the Agamid the premaxillary pou is ees aimee separated below posteriorly from the vomer by the intervention of the maxillaries. The coronoid bone is produced posteriorly and not anteriorly on the outside of the mandibular ramus. The splenial bone is of reduced size and is most frequently wanting; and the articular is much more developed on the inner than on the outer side of the ramus. The groove of Meckel’s cartilage is not roofed over between the splenial and internal mental foramina. In all the above characters the Agamide agree with the Chameleonide.,

In the Iguanide, the premaxillary is very seldom separated from the vomer on the palatal face. The coronoid bone is produced anteriorly and not posteriorly on the external face of the ramus. The splenial bone is well developed, and the Meckelian is more or less roofed over. The angular bone is much more developed on the external than the internal face of the ramus. In these characters the Iguanidie agree with the majority of the Diploglossa and Leptoglossa.
In neither family are the temporal fossz overroofed with ossification, nor do any of their members exhibit osteodermal plates.
The Agamide are restricted to the Old World. The Iguanidie inhabit the New World, Madagascar, and the Fiji Islands.

The following are some of the osteological characters of this family:
Teeth in alveola, coossified with them in adults (acrodont. )
Premaxillary generally separated from maxillopalatines by mavxillaries, small, undivided.
Splenial small, or more frequently wanting; Meckelian groove open; angular and surangular distinct, the former small on outer, much prolonged on inner face of ramus. Coronoid produced posteriorly on external face of mandible.
An examination of twelve genera of this family shows that the visceral characters agree in general with those of the Iguanidwe. The liver is bilobate posteriorly in Calotes and in Uromastix; more conspicuously so in the latter, where the posterior border is deeply emarginate. In Amphibolurus barbatus and Megalochilus auritus the border is trilobate; in the former the middle lobe is more than usually distinct and lies superior to the right and left lobes. In these two species also the ventral mesentery is bifurcate to the. proximal end of the liver. In the A. barbatus the cystic mesentery is short, and the urinary bladder is rudimental. In Megalochilus the small intestine is rather short. The

colon is generally present, and the cecum is quite conspicuous in Draco, Stellio, and Agama (aculeata), and less so but present in Lophura, Calotes, Uromastix, and Phrynocephalus.
The mesenteries present the usual sheets, hepatoventral, gastrohep| atic, left gastropulmonary, right hepatic, which includes the right lung. I have noted the following modifications: In Agama colonorum the left gastropulmonary has become a right gastrohepatic by its continuing to the liver, a character observed in Chameleon and the Anoline. There is also in this species a left hepatomarginal. In Megalochilus auritus there is a right hepatoventral, as in Phrynosoma.
Ihave had the opportunity of examining the hemipenes of a relatively small number of species of this family. As already remarked, the surface is generally calyculate. I have not found terminal papillz in the genera Uromastix, Agama, Liolepis, Physignathus, or Calotes. The general construction is, that opposite the suleus spermaticus is a strong longitudinal welt. Near the apex this welt becomes adherent to the side on which the sulcus runs, dividing the organ into two apical

portions. The suleus bifurcates and passes along the base of this partition. In Liolepis there are two welts inclosing a smooth space between them. In Calotes cristatellus there is a lesser welt on each side of the principal one. In all the genera the basal part is smooth and it is sometimes thrown into longitudinal folds.
Boulenger makes the following general remarks on the Agamide :
The chief character by which the lizards of this family are at once distinguished from their allies is the acrodont dentition. The teeth may usually be divided into three kinds, viz, incisors, canines, and molars. The latter are more or less compressed, frequently tricuspid; regular canine teeth are present, one or two on each side, in most of the genera; in Uromastix and Aporoscelis, however, these enlarged teeth are absent, and the anterior lateral teeth wearing out with age, a toothless cutting edge is left between the molars and the incisors, which, in these two genera, unite in the adult to form a large single or divided cutting tooth.
The skull is less depressed and more strongly ossified than in the preceding families, and postorbital and postfronto-squamosal bone arches are well developed; in Lyriocephalus, as in several Iguanoids, another arch is formed by processes of the pre and postfrontals which unite surrounding a large supraorbital fossa, The premaxillary is single, the nasals are double, and the frontal and parietal single; the pterygoids are usually widely separated and constantly toothless; the os transversum is strongly developed; a columella cranii is present. Dermal ossifications on the skull are constantly absent. The fore limbs are well developed, and, except in

<<<Page: 242>>>

Sitana, which lacks the outer toe, pentadactyle. The clavicle is not dilated, and the interclavicle is T-shaped or anchor-shaped, frequently small; the sternum usually presents two fontanelles, which however, are missing in Lyriocephalus and Moloch, the latter genus being especially remarkable for having the sternum divided longitudinally.
The tympanum is either exposed or concealed under the skin. The eye is small and the pupil round; eyelids well developed. The tongue is thick, entirely attached or slightly free in front, not, or but slightly, nicked anteriorly; it is more free, protractile, and more distinctly incised in the herbivorous genera Lophura, Liolepis, and Uromastic.
Femoral and prieanal pores are absent in the majority of the genera; it is a remarkable fact that they exist, at least in the males, in all Australian genera but one (Chelosania, known as yet from a unique specimen), whereas they are missing in all others except Uromastix and Liolepis. There are no symmetrical plates on the head or on the belly; and ornamental appendages, such as crests, gular pouches, etc., are frequently present, either in the males only or in both sexes. The tail is usually long and not fragile; it is prehensile only in the genus Cophotis, and some Phrynocephali have the curious faculty of curling upward the extremity of that organ.
Fig. 15. AGAMIDA. LIOLEPIS BELLII GRAY.
The digits are usually keeled inferiorly or denticulated laterally. The shape of the body as well as the scaling vary considerably, according to the genera, and in adaptation to the modes of life. Generally speaking, ground Agamoids have the body depressed, and arboreal compressed, but a division of the genera into terrestrial and arboreal, which has hitherto been almost generally accepted, must be given up as impracticable and unnatural. Most Agamoids are exclusively insectivorous; Lophura, Liolepis, and Uromastix are herbior frugivorous, while some species of Agama have a mixed diet; again, a systematic division into insectivorous and herbivorous, as has been proposed by Theobald, would be as unsatisfactory as that into terrestrial and arboreal.
Leaving out the strongly specialized genera Draco and Moloch, all the forms pass very gradually one into another in different directions, rendering a sharp generic division, and, still more, a serial arrangement, a matter of great difficulty.
The Agamidw inhabit Africa, Asia, Australia, and Polynesia. They are most numerous in species as well as in genera in the Indian region. In Africa they are represented by only three genera, viz, Agama, Aporoscelis, and in the northern parts, Uromastix. Four species extend slightly beyond the limits of Asia and Africa into southeastern Europe. They are absent from Madagascar and New Zealand.— Boulenger.

No genus of Agamidie is found in America, where the [guanide represent them. The two families present some interesting parallels, which show the effects of identical causes in producing similar effects on the organism. ‘These parallels are seen in the depressed form of the terrestrial forms in both families and the relatively compressed form of the arboreal types. In both families the former have representatives with horny processes on the head and on the scales of the body; and in both are types with horny spines on the tail. Among arboreal forms we find genera of both families with series of horny processes forming a median dorsal crest, and in others a prolongation of the spines of the dorsal and caudal vertebrie, producing a like result.

Osteological characters of this family are as follows:
Teeth pleurodont, the roots anchylosed to the internal side of the premaxillary and maxillary bones. Premaxillary not cut off from maxilla-palatines by maxillaries.
Splenial well developed; Meckelian groove mostly closed; angular little developed on inner, much on outer side of ramus; coronoid produced anteriorly, not posteriorly, on outer face of ramus.
Vertebre proccelous.
The varieties of visceral structure in this family are not very great. In the especially herbivorous genera the colon is much enlarged in diameter, and in Jguana it is divided by numerous partial septa. The liver generally has but a single posterior emargination, but in Anolis, Microlepis, Crotaphytus, and Phrynosoma there are two incisions, thus producing a short median lobe. The border is variously excavated to accommodate the folds of the small intestine and colon. Thus in Holbrookia, Crotaphytus, Lemanctus, Sceloporus, Uta, and some Phrynosomata, the border is deeply concave to the right of the middle line. In Liocephalus, Liolaemus, Callisaurus, and some Scelopori, and Phrynosomata it is deeply excavated medially.

<<<Page: 246>>>

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. eel
The hepatic mesenteries conform to the general type, with certain exceptions to be mentioned. Thus there are no right or left lateral hepatic mesenteries, and but one ventral. The right hepatic supports the right lung. There is frequently a rudimental right lateral hepatic, which connects the long right apex of the liver with the right body wall. There is a gastrohepatic which generally spreads caudad over the space inclosed in the bend of the stomach. ‘There is no left gastroparietal sheet or band. The most remarkable deviation from this type (which I have verified in twenty genera), is found in the Anoline. Here the left lung, besides its superolateral connection with the stomach, is connected by a special sheet with the left part of the inferior face of the liver, forming the left gastrohepatic. Thus the latter organ is suspended by two sheets to the left side of the middle line. In genera where this is the case the two sheets are sometimes difficult to distinguish, owing to their easy adhesion together. They may be separated by inserting a probe from the free caudad extremity of the lung.
Another variation from the normal type is seen in the presence of a right lateral hepatic sheet in Phrynosoma and Polychrus (in P. gutturosus it is wanting in the one specimen examined). A left lateral sheet is present on the proximal half of the liver in Cyclura cornuta and Polychrusmarmoratus. It isrudimental in Polychrus acutirostris, and wanting in P. gutturosus. There isa gastroparietal band in C. cornuta, which is joined by the apex of the peritoneum of the corpus adiposum.
I have examined the hemipenis in thirty species of this family of the following genera: Anolis, Xiphocercus, Polychrus, Basiliscus, Ctenosaura, Cyclura, Iguana, Corythophanes, Sauromalus, Crotaphytus, Dipsosaurus, Liocephalus, Sceloporus, Callisaurus, Holbrookia, Enyalioides, Doryphorus, Microlophus, Uraniscodon, and Phrynosoma. These differ in the bifurcation of the organ, varying from undivided (Cyclura, Iguana) to deeply bifurcate (Anolis, Doryphorus, Microlophus, Uraniscodon). Other differences are seen in the number of the welts and their surface structure, and the distribution and size of the calyces. Thus the calyces extend to the base in Anolis, but are confined to the apex in Crotaphytus. They exist in series only in Cyclura, Iguana, Ctenosaura, Corythophanes, and Sauromalus. They cover most of the organ in Sceloporus and Phrynosoma. The systematic arrangement of the genera in accordance with the characters is as follows:
I. Calyces always present. A. Three welts, one opposite the sulcus spermaticus, and one parallel on each side of it, transversely laminate. Ctenosaura, Cyclura, Iguana, Corythophanes, Sauromalus, Crotaphytus. B. Three welts, one opposite sulcus, the others one on each side of suleus, converging to median welt and inclosing spaces with it. Surfaces calyculate. a. Welt confluent proximad. ; Dipsosaurus, Liocephalus, Phrynosoma., aa. Welt projecting free proximad. Callisaurus, Holbrookia.

<<<Page: 247>>>

C. No median welt; lateral welts from sulcus. Sceloporus. D. A median, no lateral welts; calyculate. a. Not bifurcate; welt wide. Enyalioides (calyces coarse). aa. Bifureate; welt long and narrow. _ Anolis (calyces minute). E. No welts. a. Deeply bifurcate; calyces confined to branches. Microlophus, Uraniscodon, Doryphorus. aa. Shortly bifurcate; calyces extending proximad of branches. Basiliscus. II. No calyces or welts. a. Bifureate; surface coarsely wrinkled. Polychrus.
In the genera Ctenosaura, Cyclura, Iguana, Sauromalus, and Enyalioides (laticeps) the organ is entire; in the others it is bilobate or bifurcate. Boulenger makes the following observations on this family:
The lizards of this family resemble very closely, in external as well as internal characters, those of the preceding, or Agamid, from which they are distinguished by the pleurodont dentition. The distinct heterodontism, so frequent in the latter family, is exhibited to a slight degree by one genus only ( Uraniscodon) ; in all others the teeth are subequal in size, and if, as is usually the case, the lateral ones differ from the front ones, the change is gradual. In all genera, save Amblyrhynchus, Conolophus, and Phymaturus, the anterior teeth are conical; the lateral ones are also sometimes simply conical or with obtuse crowns, but more frequently compressed and tricuspid; in Jguana and Cyclura cornuta the crowns are finely denticulated on the edge. In the above-named highly remarkable Amblyrhynchus, Conolophus, and Phymaturus all the teeth are deeply trilobate or flower-de-luce shaped. The shafts of the teeth are constantly long and cylindrical and hollowed out at the base. Pterygoid teeth are present in many species; I have not employed this character for the distinction of genera unless accompanied by others. Chameleolis is one of the few lizards in which teeth are inserted on the palatine bone.
The skull does not differ in any important point from that of the Agamidie. However, dermal cranial ossifications, as, for instance, the horn-like tubercles of Phrynosoma, may be present. A supraorbital arch, such as has been noticed in the Agamoid genus Lyriocephalus, Corythophanes, and Phrynosoma. The clavicle is slender proximally, except in the genera Basiliscus and Lamanctus. The interclavicle is Tor anchor-shaped, except in Phrynosoma, in which the longitudinal limit is absent. The sternum is frequently perforated by a fontanelle. A more or less complete system of ossified or tendinous abdominal ribs is developed in many genera, in some (Anolis, Polychrus, Liosaurus, etc.) to the same extent as in the Geckonide.
The tongue is thick and villose, entirely fixed to the floor of the mouth, or slightly free anteriorly, and not, or but feebly, nicked. The pupil of the eye is round and the eyelids well developed. The tympanum is distinct, except in Holbrookia.
Femoral pores exist in all North American genera, and are absent in the great majority of the South American. In some of the latter the males have a series of pores on the anterior border of the vent. When femoral pores are present in North American genera they are pierced in an undivided scale.
The scaling of the head and body varies extremely, and gular appendages, crests, and other ornaments are not infrequent. The upper head scales are usually small, but in some genera assume a shield-like disposition. An enlarged scale is usually present, representing the interparietal of other lizards, and through fusion with adjacent scales sometimes acquires a remarkably large size. Following the example of previous authors, and for convenience, I have used the term ‘‘ occipital” for this

<<<Page: 248>>>

shield, although it is not homologous with that so called; but I have had to depart from this rule in dealing with the genus Liolaemus, in which, owing to the greater development of the parietals and the presence of a true occipital, that terminology might have led to confusion.
The habits of the numerous members of this family are as varied as their physiognomy. All the forms which we have observed in the Agamoids are repeated here save the parachute-bearing Dragons, which have no pleurodont analogues. On the other hand, such types as the Anoles, with their digital expansions, and the semimarine algivorous Amblyrhynchus are unrepresented in the acrodont series. However, this apparent parallelism between the Agamoid and Iguanoid series of genera is very superficial, and there is, it appears to me, not one form so exactly repeated in both as to deserve to be united into the same genus were the character of the dentition, on which the family distinction is based, not to be considered.
The great majority of Iguanoids are insectivorous; Iguana, Brachylopus, Amblyrhynchus, Conolophus, Phymaturus, Sauromalus, Basiliscus, and Dipsosaurus are herbivorous, and the Ctenosaura are reported to be omnivorous.
Mr. J. Perey Moore! states that the Liocephalus carinatus of the Bahama Islands is carnivorous, “not even stopping at cannibalism,” while from the stomach of an individual of the same species, also from the Bahamas, I took parts of flowers, with seed vessels and seeds; so that this form also is omnivorous.
Some species of Sceloporus and Phrynosoma are at present the only Iguanoids known to be ovoviparous.
With the exception of two genera occurring in Madagascar and one in the Friendly and Fiji islands, the range of this family is restricted to the New World.—(Boulenger. )
Systematic.—The elements composing the mandible may be fused at some points in certain genera, as may be discovered under the heads of the osteology of each. In Anoline the surangular is either wanting or is fused with the angular. On this ground I proposed at one time to separate this group from the remainder of the Iguanid as a distinct family, but the presence of similar variations in some genera of the latter makes it proper to abandon this course.
There are three distinct subfamilies of this family, which may be distinguished by characters of the skeleton. The first is characterized by the presence of numerous abdominal ribs, which do not connect with the sternum. This is the Anolinz of the present work, and the Gastropleure of Wiegmann (1834). I have fortified this character by the discovery of the peculiarity of the left pulmonary mesentery, above mentioned. In the two other subfamilies the mesenteric characters are identical. In the Basiliscinwe the proximal extremity of the clavicle is expanded and perforated, as in the Teiide and other Leptogloss types. In the Iguanine it is simple. These divisions may be tabulated as follows:

Twelve genera of this family enter the nearctic fauna. But one of these (Sceloporus) is found in its Eastern and Austroriparian districts, while four are found in the Central (Sceloporous, Phrynosoma, Holbrookia, Crotaphytus). The Pacific district includes four (Sceloporus, Uta, Phrynosoma, Crotaphytus); while the remaining genera belong to the Sonoran. Of these genera Phrynosoma and Sceloporus only oceur in the Mexican district of the neotropical realm.
The geographical distribution of the genera is represented in the accompanying table:

The genus Anolis, as defined by Duméril and Bibron, embraces a great number of species, differing widely in external characters, which have been made the basis of generic and subgeneric characters by various authors, especially by Fitzinger. In general, the species may be distinguished into five groups. There are, first, those that possess a caudal fin in the male sex; a few large species and one or two small ones from the West Indies. Second, species with compressed tail, with caudal crest of scales, and with smooth ventral scales; a moderate number of species, chiefly from the West Indies, but several from Mexico and Central America. Third, species with tail like the preceding, but with keeled ventral scales; a few species characteristically West Indian. Fourth, species without median superior crest of scales on the tail, which is more or less round; ventral scales smooth; numerous species from South America, Central America, Mexico, and a very few from the West Indies. Fifth, tail like the last, ventral scales keeled; the major-

ity of the species, chietly from Central America and Mexico, but a few West Indian.
The species inhabiting the United States belongs to the second section of the genus. In size it is intermediate.
The species of this genus are of arboreal habits, and they abound in the tropical parts of America, and there only. They run with great rapidity on the trunks and branches of trees, and dodge the pursuer with great ease. Their food consists of insects, and to a large extent of ants.
* The A. vermiculatus of Cuba is said by Poey to dive into the water after insects from bushes on the shore. The species of Chameleolis have a good deal the appearance of chameleons, but the posterior cranial arches are not so elevated. All the species have wonderful powers of metachrosis, in which respect they quite equal the chameleons. Within the genus Anolis, which embraces 120 species, there is a great range of size and form. Thus the species A. cuviert and ricordii of the Antilles and edwardsit of Jamaica reach a foot and more in length, while the 4. distichus does not exceed 3 inches. The species cuviert and ricordii, with the smaller cristatellus of the Virgin Islands, are peculiar in the possession of a caudal fin in the males, which is stretched on a frame composed of the neural spines of the vertebra, as in the genus Basiliscus. This structure disappears so insensibly in the allied species that we can not sustain the genus Dactyloa Gray, proposed for such forms. In coloration the species display much beauty and variety. Thus, the A. edwardsii and cuvieri become a most vivid green under appropriate circumstances. The A. heliactin of Mexico is a golden
yellow, and A. pulcheilus of the Virgin Islands is also a metallic yellow. The A. cyanopleurus of Cuba is a brilliant blue, as is also the Haytian A. celestinus. A. loysianus is of a kaolin white at times. The large A. insignis of Costa Rica displays delicate dove and fawn colors, mingled with more brilliant tints. The fans of the males are generally marked with pink, purple, blue, or golden spots.
Osteology.—The following osteological description is taken principally from the A. carolinensis, but other species which I have examined do not differ from it.
Premaxillary with long superior spine, and no inferior spine, but a notch. Nasals distinct, separated by premaxillary spine. Frontal and parietal bones each undivided, the pineal foramen on the coronal suture. Prefrontal large, not extending over orbit; lachrymal narrow, in contact with jugal. Postfrontal small, distinct; postorbital large. Supratemporal slender, forming the greater part of the supratemporal arch, its anterior extremity in contact with the postorbital and postorbital process of jugal bones. Paroccipital small; parietoquadrate arch well developed. Supraoccipital loosely attached, coossified with exoccipital.
The frontal bone is grooved on the median line below. The postoptics are within the epipterygoids, and are curved, inclosing a subeir

<<<Page: 257>>>

cular space, and have a short external branch. The epipterygoid leaves the pterygoid behind the ectopterygoid process, and articulates with the parietal, passing some distance in front of the petrosal. The petrosal is very short above; the subforaminal process is distinct, and the inferior groove looks outward as well as downward. Quadrate with wide external conch and no internal conch. Stapes not deeply sunk; columella slender. The vomers are flat and elongate, and are not separated by a groove. The palatines are broad and flat, and the maxillopalatine foramen is small. The pterygoids are broad and flat in front, and are then abruptly contracted from the outside to a narrow posterior part. This curves outward from the long basipterygoid processes to the quadrate. The ectopterygoids are short and are deflected at the proximal extremity. Presphenoid long and rodlike. Occipital condyle convex, simple, without exoccipital divisions.
The mandible has marked peculiarities. The Meckelian groove is closed, and the splenial bone, if present, is minute. I do not detect it. in the A. carolinensis. There is a fossa on the inside of the ramus at the base of the coronoid. The latter bone is developed much anterior to its apex on the external face, and not posteriorly. The dentary is produced far posterior to the coronoid. The angular and articular are fused, and the angle is rather short and has an internal angular projection (Xiphocercus valenciennii, Anolis equestris, A. marmoratus, A. carolinensis).
The hyoid apparatus has the extreme development seen in all the lizards with a gular compressed pouch or fan. That is, the ceratobranchials of the second pair are closely appressed and produced to a great length. First pair of ceratobranchials and ceratohyals simple, the latter attached to the extremities of the moderately developed hypohyals.
The scapular arch conforms to the Iguanid type. There is a proscapula well above the coracoid, and a single coracoid notch. The sternum has a small median fontanelle which is reached by the long posterior limb of the interelavicle. Two ribs attached to each side of sternum, and three to each of the slender, closely appressed xiphoid rods. There are five pairs of abdominal ribs in Anolis carolinensis, and four, five, and six in other species.
The vertebr have no zyosphen nor elongate diapophyses. There are eight cervical vertebrie, of which only the last four have ribs, all of which have simple heads, the last two being elongate and reaching to the plane of the sternum.
The caudal vertebree have no supplementary dividing suture, and there is but one neural spine. The chevron bones are attached at the extremity of the centrum.
The pubes unite at an acute angle, and have well-developed pectineal process at the middle of their length. Theischia have a prominent tuber.
The premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are simple; the others are tricuspid.

Our single species is easily identified by the following characters:

Fig. 16. ANOLIS CAROLINENSIS CUVIER. xe Collection of E, D. Cope.
Head lengthened, narrow, roughened above, and resembling that of an alligator. Two conspicuous crests of large angular plates, separated by two other rows, bordering the supraorbital space behind and

<<<Page: 259>>>

internally, and running forward distinctly between the nostrils. Nostrils more superior than lateral; inside of the canthus rostralis, which extends nearly to end of snout. Cephalic plates all longitudinally rugose or carinated. No crest on back or tail. Tail rounded. Seales on body and sides small, paved, slightly angular, and about equal; those of belly larger, oval, carinated. Large scales of the leg confined chiefly to the anterior surfaces.
Color green or brown above, whitish beneath. Cheeks with a long dusky spot. Upper parts sometimes blotched with dusky, as also occasionally the inside of legs. Chin with three dotted lines on each side interrupted anteriorly.
Head very large, forming nearly or quite one-third of the distance from snout to anus; much depressed and pyramidal; thé sides plane, straight, and converging to near the rounded tip, and perpendicular to the plane upper surface. The width is about one-half the length to the ear. Nostrils entirely superior and internal to the canthus rostralis, opposite the junction of the first and second labial. Upper surface of head with ten ridges more conspicuous with age, which begin as a posterior and inner border to the supraorbital region, wider a little in front of this, and then converge until they meet between the nostrils. All the plates on the head large and longitudinally wrinkled. The cephalic ridges are composed each of about twelve plates, which, with a few intermediate ones, are the largest on the head. ‘The supraorbital space exhibits five or six large plates in two series (the inner largest) and bordered internally by one row, externally by thirteen or fourteen of small tubercular plates. The canthus rostralis is formed by six sharp, long, imbricated plates; the side of the head below this to the labials is longitudinally excavated, the space occupied behind by five rows of nearly equal plates. The rostral is very broad, but low. There are 10 long, low, upper labials and about 11 lower; there is no median plate at the end of the lower jaw. The lower labials are margined by several series of elongated narrow plates, three or four anteriorly and a larger number behind, the third larger than the rest. All the other plates on the under surface of the head are small, elongated, tubercular, and paved. The scales are all small and nearly uniform on the back and sides, where they are tubercular, rounded, slightly carinated, but not imbricated. The belly scales are larger, more imbricated and rhomboidal, more carinated. The scales on the legs resemble those of the sides, except on the anterior faces when the limbs are folded and drawn up, where the scales are larger, imbricated, carinated, and acute. The scales on the tail are larger, strongly carinate, and in whorls. It is about twice the head and body, compressed and much attenuated, with a central series of larger scales along the upper edge. The hind leg brought forward reaches to the lower jaw; the hind foot is twothirds the head, and is contained about four times in the head and body. Itis about equal to the fore leg from the elbow. The fitth hind

<<<Page: 260>>>

toe is not quite as long as the second; the free portion of the longest is less than half the head. There are no crests along the dorsal line. There is a conspicuous longitudinal fold or flap of skin beginning about the middle of the chin and extending back sometimes over the entire chest.
I find a good deal of apparent variation in the proportions of the head, which sometimes seems to be shorter and broader than as described. I am, however, unable, with the series in hand, to find any other characters to correspond. As far as I can judge, the form with broader head is most abundant among specimens from the Mississippi Valley, those from the Atlantic States and Florida being as described above.
In the alcoholic specimen the color varies from light green to gray or brownish olive; greenish white beneath, sometimes brassy or bronzed, and palest about the pubic region. The edge of the upper jaw is whitish, the space behind the eye (sometimes before it) blackish. Beneath the head are several faint longitudinal lines (two or three on each side) of elongated spots, usually obsolete on the tip of the chin.
Sometimes there is an indistinct olivaceous yellow tinge along the back; the upper surfaces spotted with black, especially along this yellowish region.
Duméril and Bibron find no difference between the common Anolis of the Southern United States and one inhabiting Cuba, beyond the brighter colors and the absence of the dusky patch on the temples. On comparing pretty large series, however, I find that the cephalic plates of the Cuban animal are smoother and more regular, especially those on the side; the head more truncate anteriorly; the nostril apparently farther back; the scales on the fore part of back and, toa less extent, the body generally decidedly larger. The dilation of the toes is also more conspicuous. The cheeks, as stated, are without the brown patch.
The Anolis carolinensis is distributed from the Rio Grande to Florida, inclusive, and extends as far north as Kinston, North Carolina. It is, moreover, common in the Bahama Islands and Cuba, where it reaches a size rather superior to what is usual in the United States.
The following notes as to the food, habits, and color changes of Anolis principalis were made by Rey. 8. Lockwood, who had a specimen under observation for a number of months.!
It was observed that Anolis did not fancy beetles, but was fond of diptera or flies, while an occasional spider was taken with a relish. In capturing its prey, which was put alive into the fern case where the lizard was confined, the whole process was direct and neatly done, and the food secured without a bit of leaf or straw. Its cast-off skin, shed several times in one summer, was also invariably eaten, and even the bits that fell between the plants were carefully picked up.
1American Naturalist, X, 1876, p. 4.

Its two extremes of color are a deep, warm, bronzy brown and a pale but bright pea green. Throughout the day, although occasionally playing with diverse colors, it was for the most part brown, and this, too, although walking or nestling among green leaves. At night, when suspended, head up, from the posts at the corners of the fern case, it — was invariably found to be a bright green.
Its change of color while basking in the sun is given in the following language:
Now begins that wonderful play of colors. It appears first in the normal bronze brown of the back. Literally they are lively colors, such are the moving changes, as the folds of the skin, especially those on the neck, catch the sunlight. That deep umber is now mellowing into a yellowish brown. A minute more and it has a bronze, coppery tint. Now it runs into an olive green; anon, a leek green; at last, a pale but bright pea green. Through all this color transformation there is on the back a medial line extending from head to tail which is always of a hue paler than all the rest. As to the under parts, the customary ashiness is all gone. It is white, not glaring, but soft. I think the tiny scales are set a little on edge, thus giving the white the aspect of frosted silver. Over the green of the back is a bloom, so that it looks like frosted green. ‘Ihe top of the flat head doggedly retains its dark, normal brown. * In ordinary repose the eyelids are pale brown, but these organs are equally susceptible of color change. Not only will they run rapidly through the whole scale, but the positive colors will be spread in decided and rapid contrast. These winking lids emulate the gems. Nowa palish brown, they are smoky topazes. Instantly they become green emeralds, and, quicker than one can write, flash into the peculiar blue of the turquoise.
The delicate markings of very dark brown on the back and. sides, made up of straight lines, zigzags, and chevrons, are constant, never changing their color.
Only twice during the summer did Mr. Lockwood’s specimen exhibit the phenomena of inflating its throat. Then the colors of the dewlap were very fine, ending in a perfect flame of intense scarlet.
When the first sharp days of October set in, the lizard selected a hummock of dry sphagnum in the fern case, and with its nose worked a hole something after the manner of a toad while making its hole. This burrow was utilized for a sleeping place, and was occupied also on cold, dark days.

The genus Ctenosawra includes species of large size, which inhabit the forests of the Central American region. In other parts of Neotropica they are unknown. In the West Indian region their place is taken by the genus Cyclura, while Iguana ranges almost the entire realm. One species enters the extreme limit of Nearctica, at the southern part of the Lower Californian Peninsula, and one occupies the Plateau to southern Arizona.
The species are powerful and active, and can make a good defense when necessary by the use of their small sharp teeth and of their spinous tail. This organ is armed with rings of spinous scales, which are very acute, and which inflict considerable wounds when driven against the naked surface of the skin. In the smallest species, the C. quinquecarinata, the spines are especially large and are fewer in number than the other species, the form approaching the allied genus, Cachryx Cope. In the latter, of which the species are also Central American, the tail is abbreviated so as to be spinous to the end. In Ctenosaura the spines terminate a considerable distance cephalad of the distal part of the long slender tail.
These reptiles are valued as food by the natives of Central America, where they, like other large tree lizards, are called Iguanas.

This species was known to De Blainville as long ago as 1835, and he gives a figure of it. He and Bocourt, in his fine work on the reptiles of Mexico, regarded it as the Lacerta acanthura of Shaw.' This can not be correct, as Shaw distinctly states that the dorsal crest of his species extends to the rump. It is probably one of the species of the next section (II) of the genus, but which one I am unable to ascertain.
CTENOSAURA MULTISPINIS Cope.
Ctenosaura multispinis Corr, Proc., American Philosophical Society, XXIII, 1885, p. 267.
Head elongate, flat above, muzzle narrowed; nostril in the second third of the length to the orbit. Three scales on canthus rostralis, each deeper than long. Seven flat scales across muzzle between anterior angles of orbits. Two rows between supraorbital series. Scales above temporal muscles rather large, weakly keeled. Five series of infralabial plates, not separated by smaller ones. Dorsal crest rather elevated in adult, terminating at the rump. Median caudal crest composed of conical scales, beginning above the posterior margin of the femora. Tail cylindrical at base, covered by whorls of prominent scales with conical points which project strongly and which are separated by one row of smaller flat scales on the upper half of the tail. On the inferior side of the tail the whorl rows are separated by two intervening rows, which are just like them, having a keel and a mucronate apex. Beyond the middle of the length (end lost) the tail is strongly compressed, but whether this due to shriveling on drying I am not sure. Median series of spinous scales uninterrupted. The abdominal scales are larger than the dorsal, which are longer than the lateral scales; all are subquadrate, and none are keeled.
Seven femoral pores. Color, above and below, black.
Measurements.—Length from end of muzzle to vent, 255 mm.; length to line of axilla, 125 mm.; length to line of auricular meatus, 62 mm.; width

I have before me two stuffed specimens of this species, a large one and probably adult, and a smaller and younger one, which I described above. Thisis No 201 of Sumichrast’s collection, and was procured by him at Dondomingvillo, in the State of Oaxaca, and sent to the Sinith. sonian Institution. The other specimen was obtained near Batopilas, Chihuahua, by Mr. Edward Wilkinson, and was recorded by me as Cyclura acanthura in the catalogue of his collection.' It agrees with the type specimen in having the distal two-thirds of the tail strongly compressed. The dorsal crest is much less elevated, probably owing to its younger age. The colors are paler, the prevailing tint being light brown with indistinct darker brown cross bands. More recently a specimen was sent to the U.S. National Museum from Nogales, a town which stands on the line between Arizona and Chihuahua. The species is clearly to be included in the area of the Columbian Realm.
I find a specimen of this species, enumerated as Var. B of Ctenosaura acanthura by Boulenger.’

esting peculiarities which constitute difference from Crotaphytus, to which its general appearance suggests affinity.
Premaxillary bone with elongate superior spine and posterior emargination of inferior face. Nasals large, distinct, not shortened in front, since the nostrils open forward. Frontal narrow, entire, grooved on the middle line below, its posterior region pierced by the pineal foramen, which is entirely anterior to the coronal suture (D. dorsalis). Supraoccipital loosely articulated anteriorly, and not distinct from exoccipitals. Prefrontals large, not extending over orbit; lachrymal smaller, touched byjugal. Postfrontal small, distinct from the large postorbital. The latter articulates extensively with both the jugal and supratemporal. Paroccipital small. Parietoquadrate arch well elevated. The vomers together as broad as long, not produced posteriorly, with a median fossa. Palatine flat, with a short maxillary process; pterygoid flat in front, concave on the inner side behind for contact with the long basipterygoid process. Ectopterygoid decurved at its inner extremity. Quadrate with a narrow internal and a wideexternal conch. Postoptice an open sigmoid, reaching frontal above, with a median expansion with rudiment of posterior limb. Petrosal very short above; subforaminal portion prominent, with a wide inferior groove looking downward. Epipterygoid leaving pterygoid behind ectopterygoid process, and reaching parietal without contact with petrosal. Presphenoid rudimental; sphenoid and basioccipital united, and with prominent lateral edges. Occipital condyle with exoccipital elements feebly distinguished.
In the mandible the Meckelian groove is completely curved. The coronoid has little horizontal extent, and that is principally anteriorly on the external side. The surangular and articular are fused together, and the splenial is small. The dentary extends as far posteriorly as the posterior border of thecoronoid. The angle is prominent, flattened so as to be horizontal, and has an internal angle.
The scapula has a large proscapula directed upward, and the coracoid has one emargination, which is large. The sternum has a narrow median fontanelle which is not covered by the interclavicle. There are four pairs of ribs articulated to the sternum, and two continue into the approximated xiphoid rods. The ribs reach the sacrum.
Vertebrie with a zygosphen articulation. Hight cervical vertebre, the anterior with a compressed hypapophysis, which soon becomes a keel, which is absent on the eighth cervical and all following vertebra. Four anterior vertebre without ribs; seventh and eighth with long ribs. Diapophyses very short, except in the caudal region, where they are present for half its length, increasing in length to the base, where they are quite elongate. Chevron bones intercentral. Neural spines of dorsal region low; of caudal region rather elevated, oblique, and preceded by a compressed vertical prominence or anterior neural spine. The centra are transversely segmented just in front of the diapophysis, except in the anterior part of the series.
The angle of junction of the pubes is nearly right, and the pectineal

<<<Page: 268>>>

process is median, short, and decurved. The ischia have a long, common suture, and are deflected downward, meeting at less than a right angle. Tuber a prominent angle. The ilium presents a short subacute angle, representing the crista. There is a deep posterior notch of the acetabulum.
In Dipsosaurus dorsalis all the teeth on the maxillary bone are tricuspidate; those on the premaxillary are mostly simple, but one or two external ones show a rudimental lateral cusp.
In the only known species the colon is well developed, and the small intestine is elongate. Its habits are herbivorous, as I have taken remains of flowers from their stomachs.

smooth. Tail compressed; about twice as long as the body. Auditory |
aperture vertically elongated, with the anterior edge dentated. Infraorbital chin composed chiefly of one single horizontal plate. Jemoral pores distinet in the adult male.
Head very short, not one-fifth the length from snout to anus. Hind foot not quite two-fifths this length. Tail twice as long. It is readily fractured, differing in this respect from the species of Crotaphytus, where it is quite tough.
General color in alcohol brownish yellow, the sides and legs marked with lines of brownish red, which anastomose to a greater or less extent and inclose rounded or polygonal yellowish blotches, which are less distinct on the back; the under part generally yellowish; the tail with an alternation of nearly equal yellowish and brownish rings interrupted below. ,
In young specimens there are two blackish spots above each shoulder. The side of the head is barred vertically with bluish, the chin and throat faintly blotched with the same. The orbits are dusky, with a yellow bar at each end of the eye.
This species ranges from Cape St. Lucas along the gulf coast of Lower California to the Colorado and Mohave deserts. To the east it extends at least as far as the Colorado River, but how far beyond is not known. Its northern range is indicated below.
In regard to the habits of Dipsosaurus dorsalis, Dr. Merriam remarks! as follows:
This remarkable lizard is more strictly limited to the torrid Lower Sonoran Zone than any other species, not excepting the gridiron-tail (Callisaurus ventralis). It ranges across the Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great Basin from the Mohave Desert and Death Valley to the Great Bend of the Colorado River, and thence northerly in eastern Nevada through the lower part of the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy, always keeping within the Larrea belt. In western Nevada it reaches its northern limit in the Amargosa Desert, and was not found in Oasis Valley or Indian Spring Valley. In the northwest arm of Death Valley it does not range northward beyond Grapevine Canyon, and in Owens Valley was not found much north of the lake. It is a strict vegetarian, feeding on buds and flowers, which it devours in large quantities. No insects were found in any of the stomachs examined; some contained
beautiful bouquets of the yellow blossoms of Acacia, the orange Malvastrum, the rich purple Dalea, and the mesquite (Prosopis juliflora); others contained leaves only.

<<<Page: 271>>>

Tongue arrow-shaped, slightly notched at tip; where it is free as at the sides, the tip beneath with two ovate disks. Palatine teeth. Cheek teeth compressed, with three-lobed crown behind; conical anteriorly ; the bases apparently in a shallow groove; the space between the bases of the teeth filled up partly with bone.
Osteology.—The skeletons of the two most abundant species are before me, namely, the C. collaris Holbrook and C. wislizenit Baird and»Girard. The following description includes both, and if any differences between the two exist, they are mentioned.
The premaxillary has a long spine above and a concave border behind on the palate, from which projects forward a pair of juxtaposed processes which together form a button-like process which has an anterior free border. The nasals are wide and shortened by the removal of their anterior border on account of the large size and partly vertical direction of the nostrils. Frontal single, narrow; pineal foramen touching coronal suture, in the frontal bone in C. collaris and in the parietal in C. wislizenii. Prefrontal large, with a prominent preocular boss, not extending posteriorly over the orbit. Lachrymal small, in line with and touching the jugal. Postfrontal wanting; its place taken by a process of the frontal. Postorbital large, uniting exteriorly with jugal and supratemporal. Parietoquadrate arch elevated; supraoccipital bone loosely articulated, not distinct from exoccipital. Quadrate with rather flat conchs, the external the larger, and with straight external border. Postopties not reaching frontal, curved, with short posterior branch. Petrosal with prominent subforaminal portion, which has an open groove looking downward. Vomers short and wide, not separated by a groove. Palatines flat, with short maxillary process. Pterygoids rather narrowed by the large palatine foramina; posterior part grooved and receiving basipterygoid processes. Ectopterygoids depressed internally. Epipterygoid originating behind ectopterygoid process, and reaching parietal without contact with petrosal. Presphenoid rudimental; sphenoid and basioccipital confluent. Occipital condyle plain, with exoccipital elements not distinct. The fenestra ovalis and foramen of eighth nerve sunk in deep fossx.
In the mandible the terminal part of Meckel’s cartilage is exposed. The coronoid has no extension on the external face, and extends a short distance forward on the inner face. The splenial is rather elongate, and extends anterior to the splenial foramen. The dentary extends to the line of the posterior border of the coronoid above and of its anterior border blow. In old individuals the surangular and articular are fused. The angle is pinched, and sends inward a horizontal process similar to its posterior process.
In the hyoid apparatus the ceratobranchials of the second pair are closely appressed, thus supporting a median gular angle. The hypohyals are moderately long, and they join by their extremities the ceratohyals, which have no expansions and are of only moderate length.

<<<Page: 272>>>

The seapula has a well-developed proscapula, and there are two deep emarginations of the coracoid. The sternum has a narrow longitudinal median fontanelle in the C. collaris, and no fontanelle in C. wisiizenii (one specimen of each examined), There are four ribs articulating directly with the sternum on each side, and two by means of each xiphoid rod. The latter are not closely appressed as in some, nor so widely separated as in other [guanidee.
Vertebre without zygosphenal articulation, but the prezygapophyseal faces concave. Cervical vertebrie eight, the anterior five vertebra with six free intercentra in (.islizenit and four vertebrie with five interecentra in ©. collaris; anterior three vertebree without ribs in both species. The neural spines are very low on the dorsal vertebre, and are a little more elevated on the caudals. The latter have a projecting keel toward the anterior part in the C. wislizenii (wanting in ©. collaris), which represents the anterior neural spine of Dipso saurus dorsalis. The centra in Crotaphytus are not segmented. Diapophyses are present, but are nowhere long. Short ribs extend to the sacrum.
The teeth are tricuspid, but in the two species examined the lateral cusps arerudimental. Anterolateral and incisor teeth simple, subequal. The pubes unite at an exceedingly open angle, and the pectineal process is Submedian. Tuber ischii prominent, a small angle, or crista illi. Acetabulum entire posteriorly.
The principal characters in which the skeleton of the Crotaphytus differs from Dipsosaurus are the following: Nasal bones shortened in front; no postfrontals; pineal foramen connected with coronal suture; Meckelian canal partly open; two notches of coracoid; xiphoid rods not appressed; no zygosphen; caudal centra not divided; acetabulum not deeply notched.
There is a small median posterior lobe of the liver. The left lobe is larger than usual in this family, so as to cause a deep excavation of the posterior border. The colon is not so large as in Dipsosaurus, and there isno cecum. The small intestine is rather long.
The species of this genus are insectivorous. I have taken fragments of grasshoppers from the stomachs of both C. collaris and C. wislizenti.
Interorbital scales in one or two rows; other scales above head larger. Under surface of fore and hind feet with the scales large, carinated, and mucronate. Infraorbital chain in a series or six or eight subequal scales,
Seales on the gular fold equal to those below the fore legs. General color greenish or grayish; the back thickly spotted with whitish (in aleohohe specimens; red perhaps in life). A double black collar on each side the neck, Chin bluish or green, reticulated with yellowish. Young with the large rounded or subpolygonal dark blotches in an ashy ground; the back and tail marked with HTMORERS ARNO ey Wo Np eA neNb ee seme Bose cu on ect aaa cobcoomoue C. collaris.
Seales on the gular fold much smaller than those between the fore legs. General color above grayish, with a hexagonal reticulation of lighter. The interstices here and there abruptly dark brown, a trace only of a black collar on the neck in asinglespecimen. Chin andthroatreticulated. No light spots .C. reticulatus.

between the middle orbits, and about seven between their anterior extremities; about six between the nostrils. Infraorbital plates nearly equal in a chain of about eight. Scales on anterior border of ear subacutely tubercular, prominent. Sometimes two scales of the suborbital series are fused, as in the specimen figured. Scales of gular fold as large as those between the forelegs. Scales on belly subhexagonal and imbricated; on the back smaller, rounded, tubercular, and not larger along the median line. Femoral pores about twenty-two. Scales on the under surface of hands and feet larger, conspicuously carinated and mucronate; on the hinder part of the tail moderately so; elsewhere the scales smooth. Upper parts of a variable shade of dark green or bluish; the thighs, back, and sides marked pretty regularly and closely with rounded or oblong light spots, which on the lower part of back and tail above exhibit a tendency to transverse light bands. The upper part and sides of head, the tibia, and tail marked with similar dark spots. Two half rings of black, extending across the back between the insertion of the fore legs, each bordered by yellowish. Under parts yellowish-white, tinged in specimens with greenish, especially between the fore legs; the chin and throat green or blue (sometimes nearly black), and quite regularly reticulated with yellowish.
The double black half collars are very constant; sometimes the anterior is interrupted above and the branches extended forward; this also seen sometimes in the posterior one. Both begin on the shoulders, and are seldom, if ever, connected below.
The colors of this species vary exceedingly. In life the light spots, especially in young specimens, are of various shades of red, orange, yellow, white. In the young the light dorsal spots exhibit a great tend ency to arrangement in transverse bands, more or less continuous. The embryonic coloration appears to be a reticulation on the back and sides of grayish or light ashy, the meshes rather large, and inclosing blackish rounded, scarcely polygonal spaces, arranged transversely; the back, with a suecession of whitish (or perhaps reddish) bars at intervals. Of these there are about ten from head to tail, while on the tail they are much closer and even more regular, forming some forty to fifty half rings. The black collars, and the blue and yellowish reticulations on the chin are very distinctly marked. The light caudal rings are scarcely ever visible in the adult (where, on the contrary, the darker interspaces become more prominent) and but rarely the light dorsal bands; the light reticulation of the back becomes broken up with the light spots already mentioned.
Sometimes the ground color is much lighter than that described, the under parts being quite pure whitish in alcohol, the upper light ashy olive.
In one specimen (Cat. No. 2721), the throat, upper part of breast, and the flanks are indigo black, very strongly marked. The tail appears unusually compressed.

<<<Page: 275>>>

Cat. No. 2752, from Chihuahua, has a series of large rounded dark spots on each side behind the fore leg, and the supraorbital plates are flatter than usual. Cat. No. 2768, from the Colorado River, also shows the spots to less extent, but there is not the same difference in the orbital plates. The specimens are not in sufficiently good condition to furnish satisfactory indications on other points.
Dr. Stejneger has pointed out! that specimens of this species from the Sonoran region always possess two series of frontal scales, while those from the Central region and the Texan district present generally but onerow. He states, also, that the specimens which enter the former category have smaller supraocular scales, a narrower head, and a longer muzzle. He regards these as belonging to another species, which he calls C. baileyi. He observes, further, that “there can be no doubt that both forms are subspecies of the same species, but whether the form now named for the first time should receive a trinomial appellation or not is quite another thing, depending, according to the code of zoological nomenclature adopted by the American Ornithologists’ Union, which I adhere to in all my writings, on whether the two forms are now known to intergrade or not.” Stejneger then goes on to observe that, ‘‘In the collection before me there are a few specimens which present features which at first sight might seem to indicate intergradation,” and he points out three specimens of an intermediate character so far as regards the character of the frontal scales.
My examination of the series in the national collection has convinced me of two things—first, that the differences observed by Dr. Stejneger exist, and are mainly characteristic of distinct geographical areas, and, second, that the transitions are so numerous that a distinct specific appellation is not practicable, and that even a distinct subspecific name is of doubtful utility. In arranging the specimens I set apart three lots—first, those presenting two rows of frontal scales (C. bailey?) ; second, those with one row, and, third, those bottles which contain specimens, mostly from the same localities, of both kinds. Of the first lot there are thirty-six specimens, in the second twenty-two, and in the third twenty-two. The proportion of specimens which do not show geographical limitation of range, it will be observed, is equal to those of the typical C. collaris, which do so.‘ Let us now analyze the characters of these two lots. In lot second, six specimens exhibit two rows; eleven have one scale only which crosses the frontal region; four have two scales which cross, and one has three scales. In lot third (C. collaris typical), four have one seale across the entire frontal bone; seventeen have two scales, and one has three scales so extending. It seems, then, of specimens in which the series of two scales is interrupted, that in fifteen one scale crosses the frontal space; in twenty-one two scales cross, and two have three scales crossing. Thus we find that the character of the frontal scales is variable, since there are fifteen specimens
' North American Fauna, No. 3, 1890, p. 103.

<<<Page: 276>>>

intermediate between the two forms to thirty-six typical of the one, and twenty-four of the other. The bottles in which specimens of different character occur are Cat. Nos. 2715, 2725, 8468, 8465, 12762, and are from near the Canadian River; from Santa Fe, New Mexico; the Rio Grande, Texas, etc., mostly localities intermediate between the ranges of the two forms. In my own collection, in three specimens from Fort Worth, in Texas, all the interorbital scales are divided but one in one, and all are divided in three specimens. In three, from near San Antonio, two scales cross in one specimen, one crosses in one, and none
in one. The superorbitals are rather large in typical forms of the C. collaris
from the central region, as stated by Stejneger, but variability is seen in these specimens quite as often as occurs in the frontal scaled. The same form has the widest head, but this character is still less constant than the others, the Sonoran form presenting the greatest variations in this respect.
I found this species common in the rocks and open woods of the plateau country from near San Antonio to Mason County, north of Llano River, or as far as my observation extended. In the northern part of the State, according to Boll, it first begins to be abundant near Weatherford, longitude 97° 50’, and extends westward. ‘This gentleman has never seen it in the cretaceous region of Fort Worth and Dallas. I found it abundant in rocky ground along the eastern front of the Llano Estacado as far north as Miami and northward to Fort Supply, Oklahoma. In the east it extends north to southwest Missouriin the Ozark region; also in northwest Nevada as far north as Pyramid Lake. Dr. J. L. Wortman obtained it for me on the Bruneau River, in southern Idaho, its most northern station yet known. It runs very swiftly, carrying the tail over its back, like Holbrookia texana and various other iguanian lizards. In its manners it is perhaps the most pugnacious of our lizards, opening its mouth when cornered, and biting savagely. Its Sharp teeth can do no more than slightly cut the skin.

Ops eee eee names wens la.nis e'sts:s 5 O00: 22 dOiseelesase MO sse 1 Adult. / Dr. C. H. Merriam! gives the following account of the habits of
Crotaphytus collaris :
The ‘‘ring-necked” lizard does not inhabit the Larrea belt of the Lower Sonoran zone, but is gzommon in suitable places in the Upper Sonoran, whence it descends a short distance into the Grayia belt. It lives among rocks, frequently in canyons, and is commonest in the desert ranges. In the Panamint Mountains, California, it was found in Surprise Canyon, in Emigrant Canyon, just above the Larrea (altitude, 1,400 meters, or 4,600 feet). Inthe White Mountains it was secured in the canyon leading from Deep Spring Valley up over the pass (altitude, 1,700 meters, or 5,600 feet), and
~also high up on the west slope, always among rocks, and Mr. Nelson collected it in
the Argus Mountains and in Coso Valley. In Nevada it was rather common on the west slope of the Charleston Mountains below Mountain Spring, and was found also in Oasis Valley, at Quartz Spring, at the west part of the Desert Mountains (altitude, 1,520 eters, or 5,000 feet); Utah (altitude, 1,830 to 2,040 meters, or 6,000 to 6,700 feet), and in the upper part of Pahranagat Valley.
In Utah a very dark form was found in company with a black form of Sceloporus biserialus on the black lava rock in Diamond Valley, between St. George and the Upper Santa Clara crossing.
‘North American Fauna, No.7, 1893, p. 165.

The Crotaphytus collaris ranges from southern Missouri through central Kansas to northern Nevadaas its northern limit; to Texas, as far as the mouth of the Rio Grande; to the city of Chihuahua and to southeastern California, to the Sierra Nevada, beyond which it has not yet been found. Stejneger,' remarks as to its distribution in this direc| tion:
In spite of the fact that this species, in certain localities at least, ascends the mountains as high as 5,600 feet, it does not occur anywhere within the interior valley
of California, nor does it pass beyond the San Bernardino range; in fact, it does not seem to reach the coast anywhere; it is evidently an inland desert form.

Fig. 20. CROYTAPHYTUS RETICULATUS BAIRD. xX 2.
Ringgold Barracks, Texas.
Cat. No. 2692, U.S.N.M.
External characters those of C. collaris as to width of head, large size of plates, division of suborbitals into a series of 6 or 8 nearly equal plates. The scales on the chin and throat, however, are much smaller, those on the gular fold scarcely imbricated, and considerably less than those between the fore legs, instead of the same size, as in C. collaris and wislizenti. Scales on the inferior surface of legs carinated; mucronate rather smaller than in C. collaris. Scales of the head, and especially those on the border of the auditory meatus, less tubercular than in C. collaris; hence no serrate on border.
General color in spirits, brownish gray; entire upper and outer surfaces of head, body, limbs, and tail covered by a network of light ash,

the meshes quite regularly hexagonal, covering eight to twelve scales in width, and here and there abruptly dark brown, instead of the pale ground color. The chin with somewhat similar reticulations in one specimen, in another the web coarser. The rest of the under parts throughout are yellowish. In a female specimen with inconspicuous femoral pores there is no trace of a collar on the neck as in collaris. In a male with the pores very large and black there is a dull blackish collar on the throat passing around the sides of the neck, but interrupted above the middle of throat is bluish. There are no indications whatever of white spots, as in collaris.
This species is quite similar in form to the C. collaris, but differs in the smaller gular and less prominent auricular scales. Its coloration is entirely different, lacking the double interrupted collar on the neck and the white spots. Any approach to the reticulation described is never seen in collaris, except in very young specimens, and then much more irregular and combined with transverse light bands not found in reticulatus.
This handsome species continues rare, the four specimens below mentioned being the only ones that have come under my observation.

side, generally separated narrowly above (sometimes confluent), but more or less confluent obsoletely below. The under parts are yellowish, the chin with broad longitudinal stripes of obsolete bluish (not reticulations).
Sometimes the whitest dots are disposed so as to constitute an indistinct reticulation with the large rounded blotches in the meshes. There are generally two dorsal series of these blotches much larger than the others. There are usually more or less faint traces of transverse light bars on the back, especially toward the base of the tail, and sometimes on the flanks; in young specimens distinetly traceable as far as the head.
In younger specimens, the light spotted reticulation is more continu-

ous, and in fact confluent. It is then generally of an ashy gray color (in alcohol), embracing large dark rounded or oval spots. Sometimes the ground color is ashy, with distant rounded spots. The yellow transverse bands are very conspicuous, eight or ten from head to tail, and about forty on the tail. The supraorbital region is generally faintly margined internally with yellowish. An external margin extends to the nostrils. There is a yellow band across the snout anterior to the nostrils and continuous with a yellow edge of the upper lip; this sends back a short branch between the nostrils. There is also a short yellow line from behind the eye. The chin is always streaked longitudinally with bluish.
With a large series of specimens before me I must confess my inability to separate the C. gambelit of Baird and Girard from wislizenti, the supposed differences not being constant. The absence of the light spots was the chief character of the type specimen, the greater size of the seales being due to its larger dimensions than the type of wislizenit.
The Crotaphytus fasciatus of Hallowell (type No. 2736) is precisely identical with the gambelit type, having very conspicuous transverse bands. The white dots of typical wislizenii, however, are very distinct.
Dr. Stejneger has separated those individuals from California as a distinct species under the name of C. silus.! The sole definition given is the following:
“Similar to C. wislizenii, but with the snout much shorter and more truncate in profile; greatest width of head equal to or greater than distance from nostril to ear opening; distance between nostri! and inner anterior orbital angle considerably less than vertical diameter of ear opening.”
Were the above characters constant they would not alone characterize a species of lizard, and examination of the series in the national collection shows that they are not constant nor correlated with any other character. I find a more reliable peculiarity of the Pacific representatives of the C. wislizenit to be the character of the scales of the palm and sole, in which it resembles the two species already described, C. collaris and C. reticulatus. This character, however, fades out and grades into the typical condition, even in Californian individuals. Thus specimens with palm and solar scales keeled are Cat. Nos. 8157, 9551, 11757, 11790, and 12663. The keels are not so strong in Cat. Nos. 2685, 2717, and 2722. They are wanting in Cat. Nos. 8632 and 14195; all from the Pacific region. Specimens taken by myself near Pyramid Lake, Nevada, have the subdigital scales keeled and mucronate. The ground color is dark, and it is crossed by light orange crossbars, which inclose subquadrate areas. In one specimen these areas tend to be broken up into large oval spots. In the type of C. copei, from the southern part of Lower California, the subdigital lamelle are equally carinate and mucronate, and the quadrate color areas consist of from six to nine round spots.

We have here, then, a tendency to the formation of a race, which is not sufficiently pronounced to have produced a subspecies. The Crotaphytus wislizenii belongs to the fauna of the Great Basin division of the central region, ranging into the northern part of the
Sonoran and into the southern part of the Pacific.
I found
it common |
as far north as Pyramid Lake, in northwest Nevada, and Dr. Wortman sent me specimens from the Bruneau River, in southwest Idaho. It does not range nearly so far east as the C. collaris, not passing, so far as known at present, the Pecos River of Texas.
This is a very active species, and is more or less carnivorous in its
habits. I took from the stomach of one a fully grown Uta stansburiana. Crotaphytus wislizenti Baird and Girard. Number ; : i Catalogue} -> = Beene When col2 “ ot ale Nature of specas: ch | Locality.

As to the food of this species Dr. Stejneger remarks:
The ferocity and greed of this species is well illustrated by several of the specimens caught. Thus the stomach of a young male (No. 18291) was found to contain two full-grown lizards, Uta stanburiana, while an adult female (No. 18276) whén opened gave up one full-grown horned toad, Phrynosoma platyrhinos, besides remnants of a grown specimen of her own species.
The habits of Crotaphytus wislizenti are given by Dr. Merriam! as follows:
The leopard lizard is abundant in most, if not all, of the Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great Basin, from southern California eastward across southern Nevada to Arizona and southwestern Utah. While properly belonging to the lower Sonoran zone, it ranges up a certain distance into the Upper Sonoran, occurring farther north and higher on the mountain sides than either Callisaurus or Dipsosaurus, and usually a little higher even than Cnemidophorus.
It was found in abundance in all of the Lower Sonoran deserts traversed, from the Mohave Desert, Panamint and Death valleys, Ash Meadows, the Amargosa Desert, Indian Spring, Pahrump, and Vegas valleys to the Great Bend of the Colorado, and thence northerly through the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy, across the northwest corner of Arizona to the Santa Clara Valley in Utah, and Pahranagat and Meadow Creek valleysin Nevada. The upper limit of its range was not reached except in a few places, as indicated by the following localities. It was abundant through Antelope Valley, at the extreme west end of the Mohave Desert, ranging thence northerly through the wash or open canyon leading to Tehachapi Valley. (It was not seen in Tehachapi Valley, which is not strange, as a sharp, cold wind blew the only day we were there.) It ranges completely over Walker Pass (altitude of divide 1, 550 meters, or 5,100 feet) and is common in Owens Valley, ranging as far north at least as Bishop Creek, and as high as 1,980 meters (6,500 feet) along the west slope of the White and Inyo mountains (opposite Big Pine). On the east side of the White Mountains it is common in Deep Spring and Fish Lake valleys, and was found on the

northwest slope of Mount Magruder (below Pigeon Spring) as high as 1,980 meters (6,500 feet). It was seen at the same elevation in Tule Canyon, but does not reach the Mount Magruder plateau (altitude about 2,450 meters, or 8,000 feet). Coming up through Grapevine Canyon from the northwest arm of Death Vailey it spreads over Sarcobatus Flat, and ascends the south slope of Gold Mountain a little higher than the creosote bush (Larrea), which stops at about 1,640 meters (or 5,400 feet) on the most favorable southwest exposures. It is common in Oasis Valley (coming in from both Sarcobatus Flat and the Amargosa Desert), and doubtless ranges over most of the Ralston Desert. It was found on the Desert, Timpahute, and Pahranagat mountains, as well as the intervening deserts, and on Pahroe Plain, and thence easterly across Meadow Creek Valley and the Juniper Mountain plateau (along the boundary between Nevada and Utah) to the Escalante Desert in Utah, and thence southerly through the sage brush to Mountain Meadows and the Santa Clara Valley. It was common on the Argus and Panamint mountains, and on the latter was taken as high as 1,610 meters (5,300 feet) near wild Rose Spring, and may range higher.
Crotaphytus wislizenii, in company with two other Great Basin lizards (Cnemidophorus tigris and Uta stansburiana), two desert birds (Harporhynchus lecontet and Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus), the antelope or white-tailed squirrel (Spermophilus leucurus), and a number of desert plants (among which may be mentioned the tree yucea, Yucca arborescens, Tetradymia spinosa, T. comosa, Lycium andersoni, L. cooperi, Hymenoclea salsola, Eriogonum fasciculatum, and Ephedra nevadensis) passes over the low summit of Walker Pass (altitude 1,550 meters, or 5,100 feet), and descends westerly to Kern Valley on the west slope of the Sierra, From Kern Valley Crotaphytus wislizenii ranges southward to Havilah, if not to Walker Basin.
The leopard lizard is chiefly a vegetarian, feeding on the blossoms and leaves of plants; but is also carniverous, devouring the smaller lizards, horned toads, and even its own kind, besides large numbers of insects, as determined by the examination of many stomachs. In the Argus Range Dr. Fisher surprised one in the act of swallowing a scaly lizard (Sceloporus) two-thirds its own size.
In many lizards, as well known, the male assumes a special coloration during the breeding season. The present species is a notable exception, the male remaining the same, while the female undergoes a remarkable change. The whole under surface and sides of the tail become deep salmon or even salmon red, and the sides of the body assume the same color, either uniformiy or in blotches. The red markings on the sides usually begin as spots, which soon unite to form transverse stripes. The central part of the back is not affected by the change, and the dark markings on the sides remain distinct. None were seen in this condition until May 20, when the first red one was found on Pahroe Plain, Nevada, but dozens were seen afterwards in Pahranagat Valley, Indian Spring Valley, the Amargosa Desert, Tule Canyon, and numerous other localities. The change does not take place till late in the development of the egg. Many pairs were observed in copulation in Diamond and the Upper Santa Clara valleys, Utah, and thence northward to Mountain Meadows and the Escalante Desert, and westerly across the Juniper Mountains to Meadow Creek Valley from May 17 to 19, but no trace of the red coloration had appeared. The red individuals were always found to contain large eggs, generally measuring from 12
Ss5°75 to 15 mm. in length, with the coriaceous shell already formed.

and imbricated and nearly equal. Tail conical, shorter than the body, with very short whorls. Claws very thick and strong, anterior much larger. Ears not concealed. Nostrils superolateral, in line with canthus rostralis. Tongue fleshy, with ten inferior terminal oval sessile pads. Palatine teeth distinct. Palate scarcely scooped out between posterior nares, which are farther back than in Crotaphytus. Posterior teeth (especially lower) with five lobes; anterior almost to very end of jaw, with three.
This genus is allied to Uta, and an approach to it is made by the Uta thalassina Cope.
The following description of the osteology of this genus is based on a skeleton of the S. ater, belonging to the U.S. National Museum.
The premaxilliary has a long spine above and a transverse posterior border below with the anteriorly directed button process. The nasals are well developed and distinct in spite of the large size of the nares. Frontal entire, rather narrow, grooved on the middle line below, and including pineal foramen, which touches the coronal suture. Parietals divided, perhaps abnormally in specimen. Supraoccipital loosely attached, but fused with exoccipitals. Prefrontals large, not extending over orbits; lachrymals small, in contact with jugal. Postfrontal distinct, small. Apex of postorbital cartilaginous, inferior face in long contact with jugal and supratemporal. Paroccipital not large; parietoquadrate arch well separated from exoccipital. Postoptic not reaching frontal, superior extremity expanded backward and forward. Petrosal very short above, prolonged below, inferior groove looking laterally. Fenestra ovalis and foramen nervi octavi sunk in deep fosse. Vomers entirely separated from maxillaries, not produced, but separated by a groove behind. Palatines with a short maxillary process. Palatine foramen moderate; pterygoids divaricating from each other outward. LEctopterygoid produced downward at the posterointernal angle. Pterygoids grooved from basipterygoids backward on internal side. Quadrate with two conchs, the internal one flat. The epistapedial cartilage is largely ossified.
Presphenoid a slender rod; sphenoid and basioccipital confluent. Occipital condyle with exoccipital elements slightly marked above.
In the mandible Meckel’s cartilage is completely inclosed. The splenial is produced but little beyond the splenial foramen. Coronoid extended a little anteriorly at base on external face of ramus, and a little farther on the inner side. Dentary extending as far back as coronoid. Articular and surangular distinct.
The premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth are simple; the other maxillaries have two or three denticles anteriorly and one posteriorly. In the dentary bone the teeth (except in front) have two denticles on each edge.
The hyoid apparatus displays a pair of parallel but separate second ceratobranchials about half as long as the first ceratobranchials. Cera

<<<Page: 288>>>

tohyals slightly expanded proximally, articulated at end of moderately long hypohyals.
The vertebre display a zygosphenal articulation. Five cervicals display free intercentra, and four of them have no ribs. Ribs extending to sacrum. The two sacral centra and diapophyses are distinct, but the second diapophysis has a median longitudinal groove. Caudal centra of the distal half of the tail segmented, and possessed for the middle of the length of double diapophyses, between which the fissure passes. Diapophyses long on basal third of tail. Neural spines low everywhere; on the caudal vertebrae they stand at the posterior end, and send a keel to the anterior end, where it is elevated into a low anterior spine. Chevron bones intercentral. Four sternal ribs and two from the xiphoid rod.
Seapula very short, with a large superior proscapula. Coracoid with two notches. Sternum wide and emarginate posteriorly, spreading the xiphoid rods far apart. No fontanelle.
Pelvis with the pubis transverse and the pectineal process external. Ischia rather slender, with a short symphysis, and each with a long tuberosity.
This genus is remarkable for the combination of characters it displays. The zygosphenal articulation allies it to Dipsosaurus and the larger Iguanide, but the separated ceratobranchials, and the wide sternum are like that of the Phrynosomas, with the exception of the fontanelles. The transverse pubes have a similar significance.
Of the habits of the species of Sawromalus, Dr. Stejneger remarks:!
It has long been suspected that these lizards live on vegetable food, in fact, Dr. Streets’ statement (Joc. cit.) as to the nature of their excrete made it almost certain; but, to remove all doubt, I had the stomach of one of the large specimens (collected by Mr. Townsend) opened, and Prof. W. B. Barrows, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, had the kindness to submit the contents to one of the experts in that line
for examination. He reports that the contents are exclusively vegetable and that the numerous seeds are those of a malvaceous plant, probably Spheralcea hastulata.
Two species of this genus are known, which differ as follows:
Nuchal seales spiny, the largest almost as large as largest preauricular spines; dorsal scales ending posteriorly in a long obtuse spine; dorsal scale rows average 16 to a head length; number of ventral scale rows from gular fold to anus averages 118; number of scales round thickest part of tail averages 50; femoral pores, 12-15; larger average length, 540 mm. (Stejneger).......-.---------S. hispidus. Nuchal scales tubercular or smooth, none of them half as large as largest preauricular spines; dorsal scales squarish, smooth, without spine; dorsal scale rows average 32 to a head length; number of ventral scale rows from gular fold to anus averages 165; number of scales round thickest part of tail averages 76; femoral pores, 15-18; size medium, length 314 mm.

seales large, 16 in a head length, ending posteriorly in an obtuse spine, even the smaller scales above and back of the arms being spiny; ventral scales smaller and smoother, but the outer posterior corner somewhat projecting and pointed, about 118 seales in a line from anal opening to gular fold; scales on limbs large, about the size of those on nape, carinated and obtusely spinose; femoral pores very large, 15 on each side; scales on tail in verticils, large, about 44 in a verticil round the thickest portion at base, on the upper surface carinate and strongly spinose behind. Color (in alcohol) apparently uniform brownish olive, though in life they are said to be ‘“‘marked with one, two, or three large, rounded, or irregular grayish blotches somewhere on their body.”!
In addition to the type specimen I have before me three others nearly as large, collected by Mr. Charles H. Townsend in the same locality. They agree in all essential characters with the type, some of the details and measurements (in millimeters) being found in the following table:

This enormous lizard is closely allied to the much smaller species which inhabits the arid regions on the mainland to the north of the Gulf of California, namely, Sawromalus ater, with which it has been confounded, but is readily distinguished by the characters given in the above diagnosis. In order to better emphasize the differences I herewith give the corresponding diagnosis of the old species.
In all probability the young of Sauwromalus hispidus is much less spiny than the old ones, but the scales would be much larger than in corresponding specimens of S. ater and their number consequently smaller. (Stejneger.)

rows of scales along a broad median space of the back much larger than more laterally; those on the nape as large as those on the top of the head; they are imbricated and angularly tuberculated, but not carinate. The scales on the sides of body and beneath from chin to anus are excessively minute, almost like shagreen, and arranged in quineunx. The seales, limbs, and upper and lateral surfaces of the tail faintly carinate. Femoral pores filled with a greenish mass. No anal plates.
Width of head nearly equal to the distance from the nose to ear.
In the young the general color is olive green, absolutely marbled with dusky (or else dusky, spotted with olive green), with five broad transverse bars between the head and tail. These bars are composed of single red and yellow scales intermixed, and are scarcely distinguishable. The tailis black, with three or four broad rings of yellow, dotted with red; much more distinct than the dorsal bars. The under parts are pea green, dotted with black points, the chin and between the fore legs with red. With increasing age these bars disappear to a greater or less degree until the general color above is reddish olive obscurely reticulated with darker; the sides and beneath dotted with black, with an occasional light dot on the back.
This species differs from those of Crotaphytus in the very heavy, squat form (equal to that of many Phrynosomas), and short limbs and tail. The ventral scales and those along the middle of the back are much larger than those more lateral, and all those beneath are much smaller. The anterior margin of the ear is strongly dentate instead of only erenate. There are no larger post-anal plates.
From Dipsosaurus dorsalis it is known by the obese proportions, the absence of the single line of keeled scales on the back, and the absence of carination on the upper scales generally. The tail is depressed at the base, not compressed. The belly and gular scales are excessively minute instead of quite large.

Dr. Stejneger remarks as to the distribution of this species:
3eyond rather vague statements as to the general distribution of the present species very little exact information in regard to its range has been published. It is evident that the localities from which the expedition brought home its specimens—almost four times as many as in any museum before—form the center of the geographical range of the ‘‘chuck-walla.” From here it extends southward along the Colorado River for an unknown distance, ranging westward into the Colorado Desert, and eastward along the Gila into Arizona. Dr. Merriam has now, for the first time, definitely demonstrated its occurrence in southern Nevada and southwestern Utah.
The habits of Sauromalus ater are described as follows by Dr. Merriam in his report on the results of the Death Valley expedition:
The ‘‘chuck-walla,” by which name this remarkable lizard is universally known to both Indians and whites (except the Mormons), inhabits many of the Lower Sonoran Desert ranges in the southern part of the Great Basin from the Mohave and Colorado deserts easterly across southern Nevada to Arizona, and north to the southwestern corner of Utah. It is the largest lizard of the desert region except the Gila Monster (Heloderma), which only slightly exceeds it in size. The broad body is black or blackish, and the large blunt tail is usually marbled with white or entirely white. It was generally found on lava or other dark rocks with which its coloration harmonizes. It isa vegetarian, feeding entirely, so far as our observations go, on

<<<Page: 294>>>

the buds and flowers of plants, with the addition sometimes of a few leaves. It is much prized by the Panamint Indians as an article of food. A number were eaten by members of our expedition, and the flesh was reported to be tender and palatable.
Specimens were secured by the Death Valley expedition in the Panamint Range, the Amargosa Canyon, on a lava knoll on the west side of Pahrump Valley, California, and in the Lower Santa Clara Valley in Utah. In the latter locality they are common both along the canyon of the Lower Santa Clara and among the red sandstone cliffs near the village of St. George, and are called “alligators” by the Mormons. Dr. Fisher found them in considerable numbers in the Argus Range, west of Panamint Valley, and examined a number of stomachs, in which he found the following plants (either flowers or foliage, or both): Dalea JSremontit, Leptosyne bigeloviit, Amsinckia tessellata, Lotus, Spheralcea munroana, and Ephedra viridis.

Another variety is darker above, varied with red, and with few or no light spots on the back, which has, besides, two distinct series of dorsal blotches from head to tail.
The head is much depressed, nearly as broad as long; the muzzle wide and rounded. The width is equal to distance from snout to end of large occipital plate. The labials and rostrals form a projecting horizontal shelf; the series distinctly visible from above. They are

<<<Page: 296>>>

imbricated oblique, as in the allied genera Holbrookia. There are seven large oblique upper labials. The plates margining the lower labials behind are decidedly larger than those on the cheeks. There are about 180 oblique series of scales from head to above anus, arranged in rather irregular oblique series. The tail is rather longer than the body, much depressed and flattened to the extreme tip, and tapering regularly from near the base. ‘The hind feet are nearly or quite half the head and body, the free portion of longest toe nearly twice the length of cephalic plates. There are 14 or 15 femoral pores.
The colors and markings of this species are quite similar to those of Holbrookia texana. The ground color in the type specimen is a pale yellowish gray, with ten series of dull blotches on the lower part of the back, becoming confluent on the tail and encircling this as a series of five or six rings, which are intensely black beneath, The five more anterior ones are blotches beneath, not spots. The most of the back and sides is uniformly and rather finely marked with approximated rounded lighter spots. The legs are banded transversely with dusky. The under parts are yellowish white; the whole posterior face of the thigh similar, with a distinct stripe of dark plumbeous, bounded above by a yellowish line, part of the ground color. In Holbrookia this line is bordered immediately above by the ashy gray of the upper ground color. ;
In the male there is a blue patch on each side of the belly (separated by twelve or fourteen scales) and not extending on the colored part of the sides. In this are situated two indigo-black patches on each side; subtriangular, broadest and truncate at the base inferiorly, and running obliquely forward and upward. The hinder one (the largest) has the posterior and inferior angle extended backward, so as to constitute a kind of crescent, with the antero-inferior face an obtuse isosceles angle, the postero-superior a regular concavity. These two marks on each side occupy about the middle of the space between the fore and hind legs. The anterior runs rather farther up on the sides than the posterior.
Cat. No. 4121 differs in having the ground color darker; the back with ten series of distinct dorsal blotches, about ten from head to above anus. The light spots are scarcely appreciable above, more so on the sides, where they show traces of having been reddish. The posterior angle of the hinder black blotch is much extended, reaching nearly to the groin and much longer than the anterior angle. The head beneath is light plumbeous and, with the jaws, varied with bluish.
In life it is probable that there is a good deal of red on the sides and back.
The female lacks the blue on the side of belly, and but faint indication, if any, of the black marks. There is a tendency to a series of dusky subquadratic blotches on the sides, more than in the male, and extending along the side of the tail. There are in some specimens oblique

bars on each side of the chin and one or two on ane side of the neck
next to the shoulder.
The description of Callisaurus draconoides by Blainyville is too incomplete to permit us to determine if it is identical with C. ventralis of Hallowell. The back is indicated as transversely banded, and the sides of the belly as with three spots, which scarcely applies to the ventratis. The numerous specimens in the U.S. National Museum from Cape St. Lucas and La Paz enable us to determine it as the same.
In external form and general appearance this species is so very similar to Holbrookia texana as not to require any very elaborate description. The most prominent points of distinction are seen in the excessively lengthened feet and distinct external auditory aperture. This is narrow, elliptical, and vertical; the borders smooth, or with a faint crenation anteriorly. The dentate processes of the lower eyelid are longer than in Holbrookia; the plates on the chin smaller, as also the imbricated scales on the anterior edge of the humerus. The scales on the sides are rather more rounded and paved, as well as a little smaller than those of the back. The feet are excessively lengthened; the hind foot very nearly or quite half the head and body; the toes very slender. The claws are all much longer, straighter, and more compressed than in Holbrookia texana.
Three varieties or subspecies of the Oallisaurus draconoides may be recognized, but they are not sufficiently constant to be entitled to permanent rank. ‘They are represented, respectively, by specimens from the southern part of the peninsula of Lower California, from the northern part of the same, and ‘from the southern part of Arizona. They are characterized as follows:

In his report on the Reptiles of the Death Valley Expedition Dr. Stejneger remarks, ‘‘ It can be asserted with confidence that Callisaurus draconoides ventralis does not occur anywhere within the interior valley of California, not even in Walker basin. to show that it occurs anywhere southwest of the San Bernardino range, within the boundary of the State of California.”
Dr. Merriam! gives the following description of the habits of Callisaurus draconoides ventralis:
Nor is there
any evidence
The gridiron-tailed lizard is the most characteristic reptile of the Lower Sonoran deserts of southern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and Arizona, where it is almost universally distributed and very much more abundant than any
other species.
let it touch the hot surface of the earth.
It inhabits the open deserts and runs with great swiftness over the sand and gravel beds, carrying its tail curled up over its back as if afraid to
It starts off at full speed, as if fired from
a cannon, and stops with equal suddenness, thus escaping or eluding its enemies,
the coyotes, hawks, and larger lizards.
When running it moves so swiftly that the
eye has difficulty in following, and when at rest its colors harmonize so well with
‘North American I’auna, No. 7, 1893, p. 171.

<<<Page: 300>>>

those of the desert that it can hardly be seen. The basal half of its tail is transversely barred underneath, and the bars are broad and distinct, suggesting the name here applied to the species in lieu of a better one. During the breeding season the males develop a conspicuous patch of metallic greenish-blue on the sides of the body and have the power of inflating a pinkish sac under the chin.
The attitude of this lizard when at rest differs from that of most others, in that the knees and elbows stand out at right angles from the body, and are elevated to such a degree that they nearly reach the plane of the back. Like many other spe-
nase
Mojave Desert, California. Cat. No. 8638, U.S.N.M,
cies, it has an odd habit of performing a singular gymnastic exercise, consisting in rapidly dropping and elevating the body with the knees held stiff at right angles to the trunk.
This species feeds on insects and the blossoms and leaves of plants in about equal proportion; at least such was the case in the large number whose stomachs were examined.
The gridiron-tailed lizard is common throughout the Mohave Desert proper, but does not reach the extreme western end of the desert in ‘Antelope Valley, which, owing to its greater altitude, passes out of the Lower Sonoran zone. It was last

<<<Page: 301>>>

seen in this direction about 10 miles east of Liebre ranch. In the wash leading from the Mohave Desert to Tehachapi Valley it was seen up to 1,050 meters (3,400 feet) and may range higher. It is common in the Lower Sonoran zone at the south end of Owens Valley, and ranges up on the warm east side of the valley as far as Big Pine. It is common throughout Panamint and Death valleys and in the Amargosa Desert. In Nevada it inhabits the deserts of the southern part of the State, from Ash Meadows easterly across Pahrump and Vegas valleys to the Great Bend of the Colorado, where it is very common, and ranges north through the yalleys of the Virgin and Lower Muddy (where it is abundant) to Pahranagat and Meadow Creek valleys. In western Nevada it comes through Grapevine Canyon (from the northwest arm of Death Valley), ranges easterly over Sarcobatus Flat, and ascends the warm south slope of Gold Mountain, with Larrea, to about 1,640 meters (5,400 feet). In Utah it is common in the Lower Santa Clara Valley, but does not range up into the sagebrush or Upper Sonoran zone of the upper part of the valley.
In Desert Valley, just east of the Pahroc Mountains, a form of this species was found which seems to be subspecifically distinct from the ordinary type. It is much shorter and broader, with a shorter tail, and is bluish gray in color. It may be the same as the animal inhabiting the desert at Pyramid Lake, Nevada, which point is about 2° farther north than Desert Valley, though in the same zoological subzone, for the low altitude of a series of narrow and irregular deserts in western Nevada carries this zone much farther north than elsewhere. These specimens suggest the existence of a form peculiar to the upper division (or Grayia belt) of the Lower Sonoran zone, Callisaurus ventralis proper being closely restricted to the lower division (or Larrea belt) of the same zone.

A gular fold. Femoral pores present, pierced in an undivided scale. Superciliary scale tectiform. Earsexposed. Occipitalsmall. Nostrils superior, within the canthus rostralis. Upper labials oblique, angular. Tongue scarcely notched at the end; attached almost to the very tip. Cheek teeth tricuspid. Claws long, acute, with an internal excavation which produces a sharp edge, the base inclosed in a sheath of two large scales. A fringe of free scales on each side of some of the digits and on the external side of the sole.
This interesting genus differs from Callisaurus in the lateral instead of vertical direction of its claws, and in the presence of fringes on the borders of its digits and soles. The latter character occurs elsewhere in the Gecconian genus Ptenopus (Gray), which inhabits the deserts of South Africa, and in Phrynocephalus, a genus of Agamide which inhabits the deserts of Asia. As the genus Uma is also found in deserts itis probable that this structure has a direct relation to the mode of life of the animal. It is probably, like its allies, a swift runner, but rapid progress in the sand is very difficult. The long fringes of stiff scales aid the lizard materially in maintaining a foothold by their penetrating the sand. It is interesting to find this structure present in two genera of such widely diverse affinity and habitat. I append a figure of the foot of the Ptenopus garrulus, taken from a specimen for the opportunity of studying which I am indebted to Dr. Alexander

Occipital plate small; nearly cireular; surrounded by small plates; smaller posteriorly. The supraorbital region bordered internally on the median line of the head by a series of small frontal plates, those of opposite sides in contact along the vertex, which are separated from the larger occipital behind by two rows of plates. Plates on the snout nearly equal, those between nostrils and orbit as large on the sides as in the middle, eight or nine between the canthal rows; canthal row including one long posterior and one short anterior scale. Plates on supraorbital region very small, and showing about fourteen series trans

versely, although three or four of those in the inner half are larger than elsewhere. The plates in the loreal region between the canthus rostralis and the labials in eight or nine rows; the labials, though imbricated, are little oblique, and have the outer edge flattened and vertical instead of carinated. ‘The pectinated processes of the lower eyelid are very large and close. The lower labials are margined internally by several series of flattened plates much larger than those on the middle line of chin, and larger than those on the cheeks, which diminish above. The seales are excessively minute above, without appreciable difference in size. They are generally much as in Holbrookia and Callisaurus, except that on the anterior face of the humerus is one series of large, and three or four of rather smaller, scales conspicuously larger than those adjacent to them. The scales anterior to the femoral pores are abruptly smaller than those on the anterior edge of the thigh, and seareely larger than those behind the pores. There are seventeen or eighteen femoral pores.
The body of this species is depressed, the head very broad and depressed, the profile plane anteriorly, though sloping rapidly. The muzzle is more pointed than in the species of Callisaurus. The ear is narrow and vertical and concealed, except for a short space below, by a fringe of three or four large flattened triangular scales situated on the extreme anterior edge of the aperture, with four or

nearer the shoulders.
The legs are long, the hind foot about two-fifths the head and body; the free portion of hind toe about as long as the cephalic plates. The forefingers are unequal; the claws very long. The tail is evidently depressed to the left; probably as long as body.
The color of this species is a light pea-green above, marked uniformly above by small spots of darker green, apparently arranged in ten series. Interspersed with these are a few whitish spots, which may perhaps be a lighter border behind of the green ones. The under parts are white, a single rounded black spot being visible on the extreme edge of the belly on either side, equidistant between fore and hind legs. The chin is marked sharply with a few oblique spots of light blue; the middle of the throat with more’ transverse ones of blue-black. The tail is broken off, and it is impossible to say whether there are any rings or black bands below.
In general form this lizard differs much more from Callisawrus ventralis than the latter does from Holbrookia texcana. The former has a distinct ear opening, with the tympanic membrane very near the sur-

face, instead of being concealed, as in Holbrookia texrana. The greater length of feet is specific rather than generic.
The difference from Callisaurus ventralis is seen first in the ear, which is deeper and concealed above by a fringe of large scales, wanting in the other. There are also several series of small tubercles to the large plates of the cheeks, instead of the aural aperture being immediately behind these. From both Callisaurus ventralis and Holbrookia texana it differs in the much smaller and more numerous plates of the supraorbital regions; the two well-defined rows of plates intervening between these, instead of only one indistinct one; the equality of the lateral and median plates in the snout frontal region; the absence of carina externally on the upper labials, or at least their more vertical sides; the inequality of the middle and lateral scales on the breast; the abrupt difference in size of the scale on the under surface and anterior edge of humerus and femur (especially the latter), instead of a gentle gradation. The femoral pores are more numerous; the large occipital plate smaller and more encircled by small plates. Other differences would doubtless be appreciable in a larger specimen.

This species is represented in the collections of the U.S. National Museum by ten specimens, of which five are adult, one half-grown and four young. The description of the squamation already given in the case of the U. scoparia applies in the main to this species, but there are many important differences, which I proceed to enumerate.
The dorsal scales are very small and round, and not transversely diamond-shaped; in a specimen where the head and body measures 93 mm., three and a half measure a millimeter, transversely. The large scales of the front of the humerus and femur are abruptly contrasted with the smaller ones of the inferior faces of the same regions, instead of graduating into them, as in the case in the U. scoparia. Thus there are fifteen rows of small scales anterior to the femoral pores, instead of only five or six, as in U. scoparia. The femoral pores number from 24 to 28. In two specimens they are 24-24; in one, (?)—24; in two, 25-25; in one, 26-27; in one, 27-28, and in one, 27-(?).. This irregularity has no relation to age, as the young do not differ from the adults in this respect. The number of loreal rows of scales do not differ in the specimens, and the supraorbital scales are also uniformly less numerous than in the U.notata, numbering eleven and twelve rows. Thereis one well

<<<Page: 305>>>

developed row between the long suborbital scale and the superior labials and a few granular scales above it in two of the specimens, instead of the two well-developed rows in the U. scoparia. The end seales of the suborbital series are somewhat variable in number and character, but there is usually but one keeled scale posterior to the long median seale in place of the three of the U. scoparia. The feet are of about the same length as in the U. scoparia, measuring one-third the length of the head and body, or less; and they are thus distinctly shorter than in the U. notata. The claws of the manus are not excavated nearly so far proximad nor so deeply as in the U. scoparia, nor are they twisted so that the edges are directed outward, as in the latter.
Tn coloration this species differs widely from the U. scoparia. On the

gular region, instead of the two conspicuous transverse black crescents, there are longitudinal narrow blackish lines. There are six or seven black spots on the distal half of the under side of the tail, of which the anterior are small and transverse, the posterior longer and covering the entire inferior surface. The black lateral spot is large and is entirely inferior; its outline varies from subcireular to subquadrate. The color of the superior surfaces differs from that of the U. scoparia, in that the black ground remains in the form of longitudinal lines, of which there are ten or eleven. The interspaces are broken up into discoidal spaces of light yellowish-brown, their isolation being most complete near the middle line. Each discoidal space has a rusty or rufous central spot in place of the black spot of the U. scoparia, and it is therefore less dis

<<<Page: 306>>>

tinct than in the latter. On the sides of the neck and body and on the superior aspect of the tail the black is broken up into small spots.
In the young the discoid areas are not well outlined, and the central spots are not distinct and are blackish. The ground-color tends to run more into irregular longitudinal lines. The paler color appears rather as the ground, and it is pea-green-rather than the brownish yellow of the adult.
On the posterior faces of both femur and tibia, proximad, there is a patch of enlarged keeled scales, with the keels and their mucronate apices directed upward. On the lower anterior border of the humerus a row of enlarged scales presents produced apices, which are recurved, forming a serrate line, most prominent near the elbow.
The tail is very wide and is much depressed for some distance from the base, and only the terminal part is cylindric. Along the widened portion the lateral scales are imbricate, and have recurved apices, giving a rough appearance. The median superior scales are like the dorsals, smooth, not imbricate, and rounded.
Measurements.—Total length, 188 mm.; length to vent, 92 mm.; length to axilla (axial), 40: mm.; length to auricular meatus (axial), 17 mm.; width at auricular meatus, 17 mm.; width of base of tail, 18 mm.; length of fore limb, 45 mm.; length of fore foot, 16 mm.; length of hind limb, 73 mm.; length of hind foot, 51 mm.

Specimen Cat. No. 16500 represents perhaps a fourth species, which agrees in most respects with the U. rufopunctata, but differs in the number of femoral pores and in coloration; is immature and about the size of the one which served as the type of the U. notata of Baird. It was caught on the Colorado Desert of San Diego County, California, at a distance of from 100 to 140 miles south of the Mohave Desert of Arizona where the type of the U. notata was taken.
In the character of its coloration it resembles the U. notata and the young of the U. rufopunctata, except in the absence of the conspicuous black spot on each side of the belly, which is present in every individual of this genus hitherto discovered. In its squamation it resembles rather the U. rufopunctata than the U. notata, and like it, unlike the

<<<Page: 307>>>

latter, it has a short hind foot, which is only one-third the length of the head and body. It agrees with the same species in the reduced number of loreal and supraorbital scales, and the larger number of small scales on the inferior face of the femur. There are seven black spots on the inferior side of the tail, the anterior smaller than the posterior. Femoral pores 19, as in U. notata.

_ General form depressed. Prebrachial region rather elongate; poste-
rior part of abdomen expanded posteriorly. Tail of medium length, depressed throughout, and very wide for the basal half, equaling at its base the width at the groin. The fore limb extended posteriorly just reaches the groin; the end of the longest toe of the hind limb when extended reaches the posterior border of the orbit. The length from the extremity of the muzzle to the axilla equals the length from the

<<<Page: 308>>>

latter to the posterior border of the femur. The upper lip has a subacute median angle which projects beyond the lower lip. The protile descends in a nearly straight line to the depressed and slightly prominent border of the muzzle. The fifth finger extends a little beyond the extremity of the first, and the extremity of the fifth toe marks a point between the extremities of the first and second.
There are thirty-two femoral pores in a continuous line and a second series immediately posterior to it, in which we can count fifteen additional pores. Of these, ten near the middle of the series are consecutive.
There are two rows of rather small frontal scales which posteriorly follow the orbital border, and are separated from the rather small occipital by two rows of smaller scales. There are about eleven rows of scales on the supraorbital region, which are smaller than the frontals, excepting three rows inside the center of the region. The scales on the muzzle are larger, nine rows intervening between the canthal rows at the middle. Four rows between the nostrils. Canthal row consisting of one long and one small scale, the latter below the nostril. Six loreal rows. Six infraorbital plates, the third below the orbit and much longer than the others, and, like them, keeled. Three superciliaries in front of and three posterior to the median or key scale. Superior labials oblique, overlapping each other forward above and obtusely keeled longitudinally. Scales of the quadrate region rather small. Auricular meatus protected by six elongate free scales which spring from the anterior border. The meatus is about equal in vertical diameter to the eye slit. Inferior labial scales smooth, in contact below with a series of infralabials which exceed them in size, which become posteriorly several rows. Gular scales small, a little larger at the middle of the throat. All the scales of the head smooth.
The dorsal scales are small, smooth, smaller than those of the belly, and transversely diamond-shaped. The seales of the inferior surface are smooth, and are arranged in open chevrons with the angle forward. The greater number are parallelogrammic, but the anterior are regularly diamond-shaped. Those of the anterior pectoral region are reduced in size, and are smaller than those of the posterior gular region. The latter are similar to the edge of the collar, except four seales in the middle, which are a little larger. Collar with uniform border. There are some longitudinal folds on the side of the neck, but as the specimen has been somewhat dried, it is not certain whether they are present in life. The scales on the anterior faces of the humerus and femur are enlarged and their acute apices are free and more or less recurved. They graduate into the other scales on the humerus, which are rather larger than those of the dorsal region. On the femur they graduate into those of the inferior side, which are larger than those of the dorsum, but are separated rather abruptly from those of the superior face, which equal those of the dorsum. The scales of the tibia are about equal to those of the belly. A few rows on the

<<<Page: 309>>>

internal border are keeled and have their elongate apices directed upward. With this exception the scales of the limbs are not keeled.
The inferior scales of the digits are not keeled or conspicuously angulated. The lateral rows are produced into free flat spinous processes on the three middle fingers, and on the adjacent (inner) side of the fifth. On the toes the fringes are conspicuous on the third and fourth, and are wanting on the first and fifth toes. On the second they are present, but less elongate on the side next the third, and on the inner side are only present near the extremity. They extend on the external border of the sole to near the base of the fifth digit. The terminal exterior scale is much enlarged and folds over the inner edge of the basal half of the claw. It is obliquely truncated, distally presenting a prominent angle at the internal corner, which is pinched and acute. The superior scale in like manner enfolds the external edge of the unguis, and has a pinched external border which terminates in an acute apex. The two form a conspicuous basal sheath. The inferior plate is longitudinally ridged, while the superior is smooth. Each ungual sheath is excavated for the distal half of its internal inferior surface, giving a thin, sharp interior edge to the claw.
Measurements.—Total length, 217 mm.; length to vent, 100 mm.; length to line of axilla, 47 mm.; length to collar, 30 mm.; length to line of anterior border of ear, 21 mm.; length of anterior limb, 45 mm.; length of anterior foot, 17 mm.; length of posterior limb, from groin, 77 mm.; length of tibia, 27 mm.; length of posterior foot, 30 mm; width of head at auricular meatus, 16 mm.; width at shoulders, 23 mm. ; width of base of tail, 18 mm.
The ground color of the upper regions is black, and of the lower, apparently white. The dorsal region is covered with disciform round spots of white (or possibly yellow or red in life), whose borders nearly or in some places quite touch. In the center of each disk is a black spot. The pattern resembles that of the pieces of a buttonmaker’s refuse. On the neck and occiput the pale disks become confluent, and the superior surface of the head, from the posterior border of the orbits forward is a uniform dirty white. On the ends the pale disks are confluent, leaving series of rather numerous small black spots. On the upper surface of the tail the disks are confluent longitudinally, leaving some longitudinal black lines. The greater part of the tail is pale, and is very indistinctly marked. The limbs are pale, with minute black specks on the superior aspect of the humerus and femur. On the throat is a black crescent, with the horns turned anteriorly and terminating belowthe external meatus of the ear. Posterior to this is another black crescent of greater transverse extent, whose horns terminate between those of the anterior crescent and the auditory meatus. Sides of head and neck black spotted. Inferior surfaces unspotted, with the following exceptions: On each side, halfway between axilla and groin, a large subround black spot. On the inferior surface of the tail, on the

<<<Page: 310>>>

distal third, four black spots. The anterior is round, and the others increase in length to the fourth, which is elongate.
This species, the most peculiarly marked lizard of North America, differs in numerous respects from its congener, the Uma notata, with which I at one time identified it. Thus, the number of femoral pores is more than twice as great; the labial plates are keeled; the digits and claws are shorter, and the latter are not excavated farther proximally; the transition from the small to the large scales of the humerus and femur is gradual and not abrupt; the fringes of the borders of the eyelids are of equal length, the inferior not being longer, as in U. notata; and finally, the fringes of the digits and sole are longer in the U. scoparia than in the U. notata.

HOLBROOKIA Girard.
Holbrookia GirARD, Proc. Amer. Ass. Ad. Sci., , p. 389.
A gular fold of large scales, sides of neck variously plaited. Scales above and on sides small, nearly even, considerably less than the ventral, all rhomboidal, imbricated. Tail moderate, not brittle. Femoral pores distinct. No external ear. Nostrils superolateral, anterior to the end of the canthus rostralis. A large infraorbital plate. Upper labials very oblique, imbricated. Head plates, including interparietal, small. Tongue barely notched at tip, with two sessile subtriangular pallets beneath. No palatines. Cheek teeth conical, posterior only faintly tricuspid.
This genus has a distribution throughout the Sonoran district extending nearly to Oregon on the north, and entering the Central district as far as Kansas inclusive. It is abundant in Texas, but is wanting from the Pacific and Lower Californian districts, where its place is supplied by Callisaurus. The species are not numerous, and are as follows:

with two bluck crescents, widening below; the posterior double its own width from the groin, from which sometimes springs a third. The interstices and borders lighter than the ground color on the sides above; below and onthe belly blue. Chin mottled with blue and white. Sides anterior to the crescent spotted with whitish. Thighs with a plumbeous stripe behind.
In this species the scales of the entire back are ratber larger than those on the sides for a width of at least twenty scales. The number in a line from occiput to above anus is at least one hundred and sixty. The hind foot is rather more than two-fifths the head and body; the free portion of hind toe one and one-half times the head. There are seven upper labials on each side. The tail is very much depressed to the tip.
The upper parts of this species are of an olivaceous or reddish gray. The back with the series of nine or ten small, dusky rounded blotches, sometimes very obsolete; continued on the upper surface of the tail as a Single series of undulating or somewhat W-shaped bars. All these marks are suffused behind with a lighter tint than the ground color. In the posterior half of each side are three parallel black crescents, extending from back to belly, the convexity posterior; the extremities of opposite ones separated above and below by ten or twelve scales; of these the posterior starts from the groin and is quite indistinct; the two others are widest inferiorly (where they are truncate), and taper almost to a point on the back. The borders and intervals of these crescents are generally yellowish, lighter than the ground color. Anterior to the crescents the sides are conspicuously and quite uniformly marked with rounded, yellowish spots, almost in a network of the ground color; they sometimes have a darker areola. The under parts are yellowish, suffused with greenish on the sides of belly (especially about the black marks) and sometimes across it. The head has sometimes a greenish or light plumbeous tinge; the under part of the head is faintly blue, varied with yellowish. The under surface of the tail shows from three to eight conspicuous, transverse, large bluish or black spots in eontinuation of rings encircling the tail, which are quite indistinct above and laterally. The posterior surface of the thigh shows a broad, longitudinal plumbeous stripe, and below it a yellowish one, cutting off a second fainter lead-colored one, sometimes wanting.
The rings around the tail are more indistinct laterally than above.
The female has a series of plumbeous blotches along the sides, nearly as broad as high, subcrescentie, with the tips truncate and close. There are two oval spots on the side of the belly, and in its white ground, just below two of the lateral blotches mentioned.
Sometimes there is a trace of an additional crescent (or even two) anterior to the others. This, however, is only faintly indicated; is not continuous, and does not extend on the belly.

<<<Page: 313>>>

Professor Baird distinguished a Holbrookia affinis as distinet from the H, texana, but I find the following note in his manuscript:
The difference between the typical H. terana and the supposed species 7. afjinis will be found indicated, as far as I have been able to appreciate them, under the latter head. I must confess, however, a very great difficulty in assigning many specimens to one rather than to another of these species.
He then defines the typical H. texana as follows:
Legs rather short, the hind foot little more than one-third length of head and body; femoral pores, twelve or thirteen. Above olive gray, with ten dorsal series of rounded dusky blotches, which on the tail behind anus become six or eight rings, intensely black below. Posterior half of sides with ten long crescents widening below, the posterior twice its width from the groin; the interspace and border lighter on the sides above, but below and on the belly blue. Sides anterior to the crescent spotted with whitish. Chin strongly mottled with blue and white; thigh behind with a longitudinal plumbeous stripe; a black spot on shoulder, and one or two behind it on humerus. Female with the lateral crescents replaced by oval spots.
In some specimens of H. texana (Cat. No. 2669) there is a tendency to a continuation of the lateral crescent in a series of rapidly diminishing, broad, subquadrate, plumbeous, crescentic blotches close together, of which four may be counted to above insertion of hind legs, continued as broad stripe almost halfway along the side of tail. This is more evident in females than males.
The Holbrookia affinis is defined as follows:
This species differs from H. tevana in several points, chief among them the larger size of the dorsal scales and the greater length of limbs. Those in H, texana are scarcely larger on the back than on the sides; and the arrangement into oblique series can hardly be observed. There are about one hundred and seventy-five of the scales from head to above anus. In H. affinis there are one hundred and fifty scales in the same distance; larger and more regularly rhomboidal. The free portion of the hind toe in terana is only about 11 the length of the head above from snout to end of occiput, and equal to the length from snout to end of jaws or of large lateral plates on the cheeks. In H, affinis this is one and one-half times the length of head and one and one-fourth or one and one-third times length of side of jaw. Thescales on the upper face of the thigh appear more abruptly smaller than the anterior ones in tevana than in affinis.
There appears to be little difference in coloration. The bands beneath the tail appear more distinct in H, tevana, more tinged with the blue of sides and chin deeper. The crescents on the sides are farther back in HH, affinis; the posteriors are separated from the groin only by its own width, instead of twice this amount. The edge of the anterior crescent in tevana reaches about two-fifths from fore to hind leg, instead of only about one-third, asin afinis. H. texana exhibits no trace of a third crescent springing from the groin. It, however, has a conspicuous: black spot on the shoulder, with one or two behind it on the anterior face of humerus, very indistinctly seen in specimens of H. affinis.

<<<Page: 314>>>

It is, however, evident that there is really but one species, as many specimens are so strictly intermediate as to render it very difficult to say where they should be assigned. In the largest individuals, however, the average of characters as assigned is generally preserved.
This lizard is the characteristically abundant form of western Texas. I found it in the first plateau country to the heads of the Medina and Upper Llano. Mr. Boll states that it does not range east of Fort Worth, in northern Texas. I did not observe it in the low country of Washington County. It evidently belongs to the plateau fauna. It runs with great rapidity, with its tail generally curved upward, displaying the black spots on the lower side. It prefers rocky ground, and does not ascend trees under ordinary circumstances.
Holbrookia tevana ranges over part of the Sonoran subregion at least. I have taken it at Lake Valley, New Mexico, and E. Wilkinson at the city of Chihuahua. The western limit of its range has not been determined.

Seales on back very small. Not appreciably larger than those on sides. Head flattened; plane from middle of orbit to snout, narrow; longer than broad. Hind foot two-fifths the head and body; free part of largest toe considerably longer than cephalic plates. Temporal plates large, few in number; fully equal to those margining under labials behind. Upper labials seven.
Above olive or ashy gray or green, with dorsal blotches, color generally similar to those of H. maculata, but the lateral spots (in anterior half of sides) are more elongated vertically, and extend into the gray of the sides. They are scarcely visible from below.
Holbrookia propinqua is easily distinguished from other species of the genus. The tail is slender, cylindric, and longer than the head and body; the hind foot is elongate, being two-fifths the length of the head

and body. Tenor more supraorbital scuta ; plates of muzzle flat; labials exceedingly narrow, five in number, followed by a flat one. Femoral pores 16-18. A pair of blue spots on the side; none under the tail. This species, in addition to the general characters of the type H. maculata, differs in the excessive minuteness of the dorsal scales, which can scarcely be counted, even with a good lens. ‘he head is more elongated and quite plane from above the end of the eye, instead of slightly convex. Its width reaches only from the end of snout to middle of occipital, instead of behind it. There are seven oblique upper labials instead of six. The legs are all much longer; thus the hind foot is decidedly more than two-fifths the head and body instead of only one-third or even Jess (two-sevenths). The free portion of hind

toe reaches far behind the occipital plate from snout, instead of only to about its middle. The plates on lower jaw margining the under iabials are smaller, those on the temples fewer and larger, the two series being about equal; in H. maculata the case is reversed, and the upper plates are Smaller and more numerous.
The coloration is much the same. The indigo-black patches on the sides, however, are much more lengthened, forming short, oblique crescents, running up into the gray of the sides, the convexity anterior. They are about four times as long as wide, instead of mere oval blotches. There is very frequently a third, more posterior and less distinct, one. The female has quite a decided light stripe between the fore and hind legs, the lateral bars more vertical, shorter, and less distinct.

<<<Page: 316>>>

The posterior edge of the hinder blotch is just half way between the fore and hind legs.
Specimens from the lower Rio Grande differ from the types from near Indianola in lighter colors, less conspicuous mottling on chin, and still flatter and more depressed head. The cephalic plates are more flattened and less pyramidal; the tail longer.
I did not observe the H. propinqua in any part of Texas visited by myself. Mr. Marnock finds it abundant near Helotes, and Professor Baird’s types came from south of San Antonio. It is doubtless a southwestern species.

rounded by minute tubercles; scales of muzzle tubercular. Labials less elongate, five oblique, one flat; femoral pores 12-15; no blue spots on the sides; transverse blue spots on the inferior side of the tail. Color light brown, with six pairs of transverse dark-brown bars between the scapular region and groin, which extend downward and backward on the abdomen. Their posterior border is serrate or digitate, and edged with yellowish, producing a variegated pattern. The inner part of the spots is frequently cut entirely off. The spots are continued on the upper side of the tail, and there are six irregular longitudinal brown bars on the neck. A brown band across supraorbital regions, and spot on upper surface of muzzle. Limbs brown cross-banded. A pale band on inferior part of side, which is crossed by the ends of the lateral spots. Below this are five or six small dark spots, sometimes obsolete. Total length, 99 mm.; to collar, 15 mm.; to vent,56 mm. This is a shortlegged species allied to the H. maculata, but with longer tail and very different coloration. As compared with the variety of H. maculata, above described, the labial scuta are shorter and less oblique, resembling more nearly those of H. texana. In coloration it differs from the H. maculata in a point not above mentioned. The dorsal ground color is everywhere the same, a rich yellowish brown. In the H. maculata the median dorsal region is paler, and the sides of the back are of a dark shade, which connects the spots as by a wide band.
The most northern locality for the Holbrookia lacerata with which I ain acquainted is in Erath County, west of the Upper Brazos. Mr. Boll found it rather abundantly there and in Comanche County. Southward it has been found by Mr. Marnock on the Guadalupe River in Kendall or Comal County. It thus belongs to the first plateau fauna, and is not widely distributed.
The specimens above mentioned do not exhibit lateral spots, but they are present on the following specimens, which have been received by the Smithsonian Institution :

HOLBROOKIA MACULATA MACULATA Girard.
In this subspecies the body is moderately stout and depressed ; much more so in the females. The head is broad and short, as wide as long, pointed anteriorly to the broad and rounded muzzle. The lateral outline of the head is very convex posteriorly, then slopes from the middle to the head nearly in a straight line to the line of the mouth.

<<<Page: 319>>>

The head above is covered by small polyhedral or pyramidal plates, except on the supraorbital region. The occipital plate is large and polygonal, the edges are raised, and it has also a central tubercle; it is situated in the midst of small plates, of which there are two series to the supraorbitals. There are two small vertical plates in line, but anterior to these there is noregular arrangement, the most symmetrical specimen showing one plate in the center of a circle of seven others, and then four median in line to rostral. There are, however, three series of hexagonal plates above the eye parallel to the inner border of small plates; anterior to which the plates on the supraorbital region are smaller than elsewhere on the upper surface of head. The eyelids are granular, with a series of longer flat plates along the edge. The

loral and supralabials are small and tubercular. The nostrils are superior, situated in a single plate, except anteriorly, but closely surrounded by others which appear to form their outer border.
The scales of the back and sides are all excessively small, almost granular. Those on the central line of the back for six or eight scales being rather larger (by an insensible gradation) than the others, and are quite distinctly but obtusely carinated; the lateral scales around the base of the tail are all similar to the dorsal. Thescales immediately back of the head are smaller than elsewhere on the back. About one hundred and twenty-five scales can be counted, as nearly as may be, from head to above arms. The belly scales are rhomboidal, decidedly larger than any of the dorsal; they are rhomboidal and smooth. Those in front of arms

<<<Page: 320>>>

are largest. The plates on the side of the chin (one row anteriorly, three behind), margining the lower labials are hexagonal, paved, and much larger than the intervening ones, as are also those on the temples. There are two transverse folds on the throat, the covered portions of which are lined with smaller scales, the narrow space between the two being covered with large rhomboidal scales like those on the breast. The seales between the fore legs are perhaps larger than those on the belly; those covering the shoulder considerably so. All the scales on the body are arranged in quincunx, except on the belly and beneath the tail, where they are in transverse series of small, nearly square, alternating plates. The scales on the under and inner surface of the hind leg are larger than elsewhere, especially on the tibia. Those on the shoulder and inside of forearm are also large. ‘The male has two plates behind the arms not seen in the female. The femoral pores are distinct.
In the alcoholic specimen the upper parts are ashy gray. On each side the back is a series of U-shaped blotches, the convexity posterior; sometimes angular or emarginate behind; some 8 or 10 pairs from head to above anus. Those blotches anteriorly are somewhat obsolete or not filled up; they are bordered behind (sometimes all round) by a light yellowish suffusion or spotting, lighter than the ground color. In some specimens there is a narrow, horizontal, light line from the orbital region above the arms and below the edge of the dorsal blotches fading out on the sides. This sometimes forms the dividing line between another lateral series of blotches corresponding with the dorsal; this series is, however, generally obsolete or else broken up with obscure mottling, the posterior border of light suffusion or spottings indicating the position of the blotches. The sides occasionally show minute points of whitish. The dorsal blotches are continued in two series on the thickened portion of the tail; the attenuated portion, however, is usually plain gray. The under parts are yellowish white. The jaws with transverse bars of plain bluish, continued obliquely backward on the under surface of the head, which is variously mottled with the same. On each side below and adjacent to the outer edge of the belly are two very distinct indigo-black blotches with a suffusion of bluish around them. These are rather elongated transversely, placed one in advance of the other, and both situated in the posterior extremity of the anterior half of the region from fore to hind legs. They do not extend up the side as far as the lower lateral dusky blotches.
In some specimens there is a decided indication of a second light Stripe on the side of the neck, continuous with the light edge of the upper jaw and extending, with several interruptions, to the arm. The upper surface of the limbs is transversely banded with dusky. The posterior surface of the thigh is without conspicuous marking.
The female differs very little, if at all, in color, although possibly the markings above are more obsolete.

<<<Page: 321>>>

There is sometimes, but very rarely, a third spot on the sides behind the others; as also a trace of a light yellowish line on the flanks, extending between the legs.
The hind feet are short, being barely more than one-third the distance from snout to arm, the free portion of longest toe not reaching from snout to end of large occipital.
Specimens from western Texas are larger and much sprinkled, sometimes all over, with small rounded white spots, the dark blotches even being at times entirely wanting. The ground color in these, as from all localities, varies from dark to light ashy, with sometimes even a tinge of reddish brown. Some of these more Southern and Western specimens (Cat. Nos. 2813, 2771, etc.) seem to have the upper labial and radial plates projecting more horizontally all round, so as to form a kind of rim or shelf. In fact, it is quite possible that Cat. No. 2813 may belong toa species different from any here described. Compared with types from the Platte, the plates of the head above are larger, those on the anterior portion of the supraorbital space being nearly equal to those between the orbits, instead of conspicuously smaller. The head is narrower, more pointed, and less convex; the scales on the cheek and inside of the thighs larger and more equal; the legs and tail longer. If not distinct, this may at any rate be considered as a variety.
I did not observe this species in the parts of Texas I examined, but a variety of it with a longer tail than the usual form was obtained from Mr. Boll, who probably took it near Dallas. Its characters are: Tail slender, cylindric, a little longer than body; hind foot less than onethird head and body. Eight or ten supraorbital scuta; scales of muzzle tubercular; labials very narrow, five; femoral pores thirteen. A pair of blue spots on the side; none under the tail. West of Dallas, Messrs. Boll and Isaac obtained this species from Weatherford to Fort Concho, and Mr. Isaac sent it from the Wichita country. Professor Baird records it as found between San Antonio and El Paso.

HOLBROOKIA MACULATA APPROXIMANS Baird.
Holbrooki maculata approximans BatrD, Proce. Acad. Nat. Sei. Phila., 1858, p. 253.—Bocourt, Miss. Sci. Mex., 1874, p. 163.
Body squat, depressed. Tail shorter than body. General form of H. maculata. Head swollen, as broad as long; profile very convex, Upper labials, six. Large plates on temples, smaller than those margining lower labials behind, the Jabials thickening. Scales rather large; about one hundred and thirty from head to above anus; largest in middle of back. Femoral pores about thirteen.
Above ashy brown. Back with ten dorsal (and sometimes an obscure lateral) series of nearly equidistant angulated blotches, seven to ten from head to above anus, and continued above the tail, the lower surface of which is plain. Sides and sometimes fore part of back rather thickly crowded with whitish spots. No indications of light lines on sides of neck and back. Beneath whitish; the sides of the belly with a light blue patch, in which are situated ten transversely elongated indigo-black blotches, which do not extend into the dark part of the sides and are entirely visible from below. The middle line of the sides falls between the ten blotches. Faint traces of a third more posterior are occasionally visible. Female with the indigo blotches and blue patches less prominent.
This subspecies is most similar to H. m. maculata, but is considerably larger and has the head wider, still more convex. The scales are rather larger. The feet are of about the same proportional length. The spots on the back are quite distinct, with alight areola. Behind they are irregularly Uor W-shaped. There is a decided indication in most speci

<<<Page: 323>>>

mens of a second lateral series on each side. There is no indication of the ten lateral light stripes on the side, nor of the pale stripe along the back separating the dorsal blotches. The sides and back are more regularly spotted with whitish. The jaws are banded transversely with bluish, which passes obliquely backward on the chin.
The most striking differences from its allies seen is the much more backward position of the two indigo-blue blotches and their inferior situation on the sides and in the whitish of the belly, and not on the sides of the body, partly in the brownish. They are also completely enveloped in the blue patch instead of having only an occasional slight suffusion of the same. They are almost entirely, instead of very slightly, visible from below.

This subspecies differs from the typical form in having larger prenasal scales separated by only two flat scales in front, instead of four tubercular ones, and in having only four flat scales between the nostrils above, instead of six tubercular ones, and in having the scales of the front flatter. The spots are obscure or entirely wanting; when present they are more numerous than in the var. maculata, there being eight between axilla and groin, instead of six. The sides and dorsal lateral regions are thickly marked with small yellow spots.
This form was established on two specimens from Lake Valley, in southern New Mexico. Dr. Stejneger has since recorded it from southern and western Arizona.

UTA Baird and Girard.

A Jarge interparietal, and the plates on rostrum and above orbits large and rather regular. Scales on sides small, granular; those on back imbricated, angular. Digits pectinate below. Femoral pores. Tail long. Ears distinct. A well-marked gular fold of large scales. Sides of neck folded; upper labials square; plane externally, not imbricate. A long infraorbital; nostrils lateral, subterminal. Tongue scarcely emarginate; lip slightly free with distinct pallets beneath. No palatines. Posterior teeth only tricuspid.
The preceding diagnosis is intended to define a well-marked group of diminutive North American Saurians, which would be taken for Sceloporus but for their very small dorsal scales and the sharp constriction, or fold, on the lower throat with a band of scales larger than those anterior or posterior to it. The plates on the head are nearly as regular as in Sceloporus. It is easily known, by the presence of external ears, from Holbrookia, which has a similar fold on the throat, and which has also the lateral folds of neck and body less distinct, or almost wanting.
There are three well-marked sections in this group; one with the dorsal scales very small, and only gradually larger than those on the sides, and another with four to six central series of very large carinated scales, those on either side abruptly smaller and tuberculate. The type species, U. stansburiana, belongs to the first; U. ornata to the second division. Dr. Hallowell has proposed a genus Urosaurus for the latter division based on a second species, U. graciosus. The gradation from this species, however, to the U. stansburiana through U. schottii and ornata is so very gentle that it is very difficult to draw the line. In all external characters there is little difference between U. stansburiana and ornata, except in the character of the dorsal scales, the proportions of tail and body and other features being almost precisely the same. U. ornata and graciosa, on the other hand, agree perfectly in the character of the dorsal scales, and yet differ widely in proportions and shape of head, body, and tail.
The species of Uta differ as follows:
A. Dorsal scales small, smooth, nearly uniform in size. Caudal scales small, smooth, not spinous. Collar not denticulate. Tail depressed; no blue on belly. (Large species.)
Median dorsal scales a little larger than lateral dorsals; body stout, depressed;

The genus Uta belongs to the Nearctic Fauna, only two species (U. bicarinata and U. auriculata) extending beyond its limits. In the Nearctic Fauna it is nearly restricted to the Sonoran district. It does not occur in the Eastern nor Austroriparian, and one species only ranges from. the Sonoran into the Pacific (U. stansburiana). One species is confined to the St. Lucas region (U. thalassina), and another ranges from that center to the Pacific (U. nigricauda). From the Sonoran two species range into the Great Basin, U. stansburiana and U. graciosa, the former of them extending far northward. One species, U. mearnsii, is found near the south border of California, while two others belong to different parts of the peninsula of Lower California (U. repens and U, parviscutata). The U.auriculata is from the Revillagigedo Islands, a region whose faunal relation is doubtful, but is probably with the Neotropical Realm.

Form much depressed. Median dorsal scales larger, smooth, graduating into the lateral, smaller than those of the abdomen, not separated by median smaller ones. Abdominal scales nearly rectangular, in transverse series. Brachial scales a little larger, more imbricate, keeled. Occipital plate large, longer than broad, triangular, with rounded angles, separated by two plates from those bounding supraorbital region. One series of interorbitals. Supraoculars in three series, five in the interior largest. Internasals, two series of four, each followed by two pairs. Scales of the collar but little larger than those anterior; gular scales equal. A narrow entire suborbital. Eight Superior labials, bounded above by two series of similar plates. Hight oblong inferior labials. Symphyseal larger, followed by two trapezoid infralabials. A scapuloinguinal dermal fold on each side.

Color above sea green; a narrow black cross band separates the nuchal from the dorsal region; a broader black band, which presents a convexity anteriorly, crosses the latter anterior toits middle. Between these some indistinct undulatory bands, three similar on the posterior dorsal region, followed by numerous caudal annuli, which become very broad.

very broad and low, with a median superior projection. The frontal is transversely divided. The largest supraoculars are separated from the frontals, frontoparietals, and parietals by two series of small plates. The interparietal is very large. There are five superior and seven inferior labials to below the middle of the eye. There are several series of enlarged sublabials. The gular region is covered with small granules, which are slightly largest centrally. There is a weak anterior gular fold, followed by a strong posterior fold. The latter is covered with small subgranular plates, the largest of which, on its edge, are about equal in size to the first scales on the chest. The back and sides are covered with round granules, which are larger medially than laterally. The tail is somewhat depressed and expanded at its base, and is coyered with whorls of small weakly keeled scales, The seales on the

Its general aspect

<<<Page: 330>>>

Stejneger’s description of this well-marked species is so full that I quote it at length:
Description of the type.—Female. Head moderately depressed, snout narrow; canthus rostralis well marked; nostrils rather large, almost superior, much nearer to the tip of the snout than to the orbit; ear opening large, with four very long, triangular, pointed scales and three smaller ones in front; head shields smooth; frontal divided transversely; about eight of the posterior supraorbital scales enlarged, one being particularly large, these separated from the frontals by a single series of granules; superciliaries, particularly the anterior ones, very long and narrow; a very long and narrow infraorbital; occipital as large as ear opening; supralabials six, and, like rostral, very wide ao low; infralabials scarcely higher, but considerably narrower; scales on throat small, rounded, smooth, those on the middle and near the edge of the gular fold somewhat larger; only one transverse gular fold, not denticulated; sides of neck strongly folded; scales on back and sides rather large, rounded and convex granules, those on lower surface of body larger, flat, hexagonal; limbs with enlarged, keeled scales, and rather long, the anterior when pressed to the side reaching to the insertion of the thigh, the posterior when stretched forward reaching to the orbit; twenty femoral pores on each side; tail depressed at base, slender, its length more than one and three-fourths that of head and body, covered with rings of rather large scales which, on the upper surface and the sides, are provided with a very strong keel ending in a projecting spine.
Color above olive, more brownish on head and tail, with irregular dusky, nearly blackish, cross bands; lighter spots, or marblings, on the interspaces; a very distinetly marked, straight, and intensely black band from shoulder to shoulder across the back; limbs irregularly cross-banded with dusky; basal two-thirds of tail pale brownish olive with wide black crossbars, terminal third uniformly blackish; under surface greenish white, bluish on flanks, with lighter dots; chin and throat with a network of bluish gray. c
Dimensions.—Total length, 229 mm.; head and body, 79 mm.; tail, 150 mm.; fore limb, 37 mm.; hind limb, 61 mm.
Variation.—In addition to the type, Dr. Mearns’s collection contains six other specimens, which fully establish the characters of thespecies. The individual variation is comparatively slight, and but few deviations from the aboye description of the type are noticed. In some specimens there seems to be a slight anterior gular fold, but it is not marked by any difference in the seutellation. In one specimen the frontal is not divided transversely, but in about one-half the large supraoculars are separated from the frontal bya double row of granules. Other discrepancies will be noticed in the list of specimens given below.
The males have enlarged postanal scales.
The individual differences of coloration consist mainly in the outline and intensity
of the dusky crossbars, while the black collar is equally distinct in all. _ The sexes are alike in color, except that the blue flank patch is somewhat darker and wider in the males.
Comparison with Uta thalassina.—Although closely allied to Uta thalassina, described in 1863 by Professor Cope from specimens collected at Cape St. Lucas, the present species differs in many essential points, most of which have been indicated in the diagnosis.
In addition to these it may be remarked that the granules on the back are larger in Uta mearnsii, but that the ventral scales are smaller; it lacks the well-defined anterior gular fold of U, thalassina; the legs and tail are comparatively longer, and the femoral pores are more numerous; each of the latter, moreover, is bordered behind by two granules, while in U. thalassina there are three. The last-mentioned species appears also to be much the laren, as the specimens collected by Dr. Mearns Seem to be quite adult.
The most striking difference, however, are the long preauricular spines and the

<<<Page: 331>>>

large, strongly keeled and spinous caudal scales of Uta mearnsi, together with the absence of the two posterior dorsal black bands so characteristic of U. thalassina.-
Geographical distribution.—Dr. Mearns found this species ‘‘extremely plentiful” among the rocks on the eastern slope of the Coast Range of California, near the Mexican boundary line, from the lowest water in the canyon at the base to the summit. So far this is the only locality where it is known to have been taken. I would suggest, however, that it was most probably this species which Mr. Lockington has recorded from Ensenada, Todos Santos Bay, Lower California, 75 miles southeast of San Diego! as Uta thalassina.

In describing this species Dr. Stejneger remarks:
The accidental nature of reptile collecting is well illustrated by the discovery of this very conspicuous and distinct species in a region which has been visited before by some of our best collectors.
The trenchant character of the distinctions between the present species and its nearest ally inhabiting the Cape St. Lucas region emphasizes the gap between the Cape region proper and the rest of the Lower California peninsula.
This discovery, moreover, is quite important, inasmuch as it bridges over the supposed difference between Uta thalassina and the other species of the genus Uta. Boulenger, in 1885, established the genus Petrosawrus for that species because of its smali caudal scales, the smoothness of the dorsal granules, and the absence of denticulation on the border of the posterior gular fold. The present species, however, has the caudal scales large, keeled, and spinose, in fact, exactly as in the typical species of the genus Uta; the dorsal scales are larger, more convex, nearly tubercular on the sides, thus approaching the other Utas, while the question of denticulation to the collar is one essentially of degree only. However, the species which I am dedicating to its discoverer, Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 8. A., naturalist of the International Boundary Commission (United States and Mexico), is undoubtedly nearly related to U. thalassina and more so than to any of the other species of the genus.

Above dark green, with two dorsal series of crescentic dusky blotches, bordered by light blue dots, the blotches sometimes obscure and the blue dots irregularly scattered and mixed with black ones. Two light Stripes on each side the neck and body, sometimes broken up into rounded spots, the lower especially where they are often elongated, forming transverse bars. The interspace of these are light lines, sometimes plain dusky, sometimes spotted with black and light blue. Beneath, greenish white; sides of jaws and the chin banded with blue. A round black spot on the anterior third of the side, sometimes encircled by yellowish; a second spot sometimes on the side of the neck. Female with the lateral spot less distinct.
The general appearance of the typical Utas is that of the Seelopori with small scales, but easily distinguished at the first glance by a well-

marked gular fold. This is very closely pressed to the subjacent skin, the internal surface lined with very small scales. On the edge of the fold a single series of about fourteen scales considerably larger than those immediately before them or on those on the breast, about equal. There are slight indications of one or two constrictions anterior to the first, but they do not form regular folds, and there is no marked difference in the size of the scales. There is also a lateral fold or cavity on each side of the neck, lined with smaller scales, as in Sceloporus, but less distinct. The dorsal scales are tubercular or granular, subhexagonal, becoming gradually smaller on the sides; abruptly much smaller in the groin. They are without spines above, and barely imbricated. On the sides they are plain tubercular and almost paved. They are arranged in rather oblique series. The belly scales are flat, subrhomboidal; in

<<<Page: 333>>>

nearly transverse but slightly oblique series, and considerably larger than those on the back. The scales on the tail are verticillate, strongly carinated except below, and abruptly much larger than those on the rump or back. The scales on the thigh are about equal except on the posterior surface, where they become abruptly smaller. They diminish very gradually below from the anterior edge to the femoral pores. All the scales on the legs are strongly carinate, except on the inferior surfaces. There are fifteen femoral pores.
The plates of the head are quite regularly arranged and large, somewhat as in Sceloporus. There is a large occipital encircled laterally and behind by one or two series of plates which are larger than those on the nape. It is separated antero-laterally from the supraorbital region by two plates on each side, the anterior in contact or separated by a very small median one. These are in contact with a single interorbital vertical, followed by another.
The arrangement beginning with the verticils is 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, and 4 internasals. The third set of 3 sometimes has the median divided transversely, and there is usually an additional very small exterior plate. The nostrils are superior, large, and rounded; in one plate with narrow margin and surrounded, except externally, by small ones. All these plates are somewhat depressed, pyramidal, or raised in the middle, sometimes conspicuously so, but they are not wrinkled. The supraorbital region shows an inner series of small plates, then a series of large transverse smooth plates with a smaller one in its concavity; exterior to these are two series of very small plates and the anterior extremity of the supraorbits is filled with a confused mixture of the same. The loral region is filled with three or four large angular plates; the upper labials are five or six, long and narrow, not conspicuously imbricated, and rounded externally; they are bordered above by one series of plates, above which is a second shorter one. ‘The lower labials are very similar to the upper, and bordered internally behind by three rows of plates much larger than those on the chin, the innermost alone running forward to the mental plate, and much larger than the rest. The remaining plates on the chin are rounded and larger than those on the back. The cheeks are covered with tubercles as large as the dorsal scales; there are six or seven much larger behind, where they are separated by a few small ones from the ear. This is small, rounded, and partly covered by a series of two or three long-pointed triangular scales on the anterior border. The limbs are short and stout; the hind foot about one-third the head and body, the claws very short and blunt. The tail is rather longer than the body, tapering gently throughout; depressed to near the end, which is cylindrical and much attenuated.
The general color above and on the sides is a dark, greenish-olive, varied with small blue spots on single scales, and with larger black dots interspersed more sparsely. There is in reality a serial arrangement of two rows of U-shaped dark blotches on the back, punctate

<<<Page: 334>>>

laterally and behind with blue. A faint light greenish line from the eye and another from the angle of the mouth embrace between them on the sides a dark stripe, quite continuous in some specimens and darker than the ground color; they are sometimes very distinct on the tail. The under parts are greenish-white; sometimes strongly greenish, varied with paler, and with a brassy luster. The jaws are banded transversly with blue and yellowish, extending obliquely backward on each side of the chin. In the male is a distinct rounded black spot, encircled by a yellowish border, situated in the olive of either side and in the posterior portion of the anterior third of the space between fore and hind legs. This is less distinct in the female. The legs are banded above. The under surface of tail is without markings.
In some specimens there is a tendency to a second large black spot on each side of the neck. s
In nearly all the more Western specimens of this species, as in Cat. No. 4122 from the Colorado River, there are certain differences from the types Cat. No. 2753. Thus the dorsal scales become gradually larger from the head along the rump to the tail, instead of having the rump scales like those of the back, and both abruptly smaller than those on the tail. Along the middle of the back the scales are all carinated, showing about 20 longitudinal ridges. Over this space the scales become gradually smaller from the central line, then on the sides they change quite abruptly to smaller, more tubercular, and ecarinate ones, smaller in the groin and above the arm. There are twelve or fourteen ridges on the rump between the hind legs, instead of sixteen or twenty in U. stansburiana. The scales on the lower part of back and rump are quite as large and even larger than those on the belly, not smaller.
The colors are quite similar; the upper part dark green, spotted with lighter. Few dorsal series of blotches. The under parts are blue in very old specimens; the chin darker; the lateral black spot very conspicuous.
The sides are frequently quite uniformly dark green, with a series of light vertical bars behind the lateral black spot. In Cat. No. 2753 there are two black bars across the nape. In this variety there is an evident approach to the peculiar characters of Uta ornata.
This species is abundant in the entire region between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. I have taken it as far north as Summer Lake in central Oregon, north of which I have no record of its existence. It inhabits rocky places, especially the basaltic cliffs so common in the Great Basin, and delights in the hot sun. It is very active in its movements.
Dr. Merriam, in his report on the results of the Death Valley Expedition, makes the following remarks concerning the distribution: of this species:
This tiny brown-shouldered lizard is common over nearly the whole of the desert region traversed by the expedition from California to Utah and Arizona, and occurs also on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, as the subjoined list of localities shows.

<<<Page: 335>>>

Whether the form inhabiting the upper San Joaquin Valley is identical with that from the deserts remains to be seen.
Uta stansburiana is common throughout the Mohave Desert, ranging westward to the extreme west end of Antelope Valley and down through the Cafiada de las Uvas
to old Fort Tejon.
It ranges also over Walker Pass and down into Kern Valley. It
is common in Owens Valley and thence easterly in the Coso Mountains, Panamint Valley and Mountains, Death Valley, the Amargosa Desert, Ash Meadows, Pahrump and Vegas valleys, and at the Great Bend of the Colorado, whence it ranges northerly in the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy to the Santa Clara Valley in‘southwestern Utah, and the Pahranagat Valley, Nevada. found north of Sarcobatus Flat.

This species has much the same form and general characters of U. stansburiana, the principal difference being in the character of the dorsal scale. These in the type are all very minute, but carinated, diminishing gently toward the sides. In U. ornata there is a dorsal series of three or four very large carinated scales, beginning near the head and running to the tail for an average width of half the head. These are not very regular, varying much in size at different points, sometimes with small ones intercalated. On either side of this the scales are abruptly very small and granular, becoming smaller to the lower part of the sides, where they are much as in stansburiana. The folds of Skin on the neck and back generally have a series of larger scales

<<<Page: 341>>>

along their summit, especially on the dorsal folds, distant about the width of the head, where the larger scales occur at intervals. The seales on the tibial joint are larger and more angulated than in the other. The hind feet are short, not one-third the head and body; the hind feet are shorter, the fingers considerably longer than in stansburiana. The head is broad; the width equal to the distance from snout to middle of occipital, the free portion of long hind toe a little less.
The tail is a little longer than the body, or possibly longer, as it has been renewed; depressed or trigonal at base, then cylindrical or evenalittle compressed. The femoral pores are about eleven in number.
The scales on the chin are quite small and rounded or paved, decidedly smaller than the imbricated rhomboidal scales of the space between the gular folds.
The folds of skin, where they can be made out, appear to run in the following manner: The longest starts in a line with the edge of the head above and a short distance behind the head, running back to the upper edge of the insertion of the thigh. This is crowned at intervals by large scales. The second begins on the lower part of the sides, just back of the axilla, and after rising a little runs back nearly to the groin parallel with the upper fold. This likewise shows occasional larger scales. The fold crossing the throat and shoulders anteriorly is continued a little obliquely backward to the upper or dorsal fold. Anterior to this, another fold begins on either side the throat and extends half way round the side of the neck, where it covers the gular cavity seen here and in Sceloporus. Here it meets a short fold running downwards from the upper border of the ear (continued behind to the first transverse fold), and from this point of intersection there proceed two folds across to the upper or dorsal one, united below. A second short fold runs from the lower edge of the ear back to the second transverse fold.
This species is of a brownish gray above; each side of the back with a series of transverse narrow bars of black, with a light grayish areola and varying in shape, sometimes a meniscus, sometimes bifurcating. There are usually two short longitudinal stripes on the nape. From the shoulder usually runs a dark line perpendicularly to the back, and sending a short branch abruptly forward at aright angle and in line with the ventral stripes. The under parts are white, in the male the chin is greenish, and on each side the belly, nearly meeting centrally, is an elongated patch of light greenish or bluish as in Sceloporus.
Variety linearis.—Among the specimens before me are several (as Cat. No. 2759), which, with the general characters of Uta ornata, have instead of the transverse bands a trace of four dorsal black lines, interrupted at irregular intervals, and thus broken up into sections from an eighth of an inch to an inch. One of these on either side borders the large scales, the other runs along the raised lateral fold. There is the usual blackish bar in front of the shoulder forming a kind of interrupted collar. There are a few light spots on the side.

A single specimen obtained in middle Utah in 1872. In 1873 and 1874 the species was found to be quite numerous in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, frequenting rocky places and eetocditels hard to catch. Color of throat, yellowish orange; of abdomen, white, ranging to greenish olive. The general coloration depends much upon the color of the rock upon which they are found.

Head broad, short, depressed. Two regular series of large dorsal seales on each side the back, with two others much smaller between them along the median line. Tail about one and a half or one and three-fourths times the length of head and body.
Above dark or light brownish gray. Sides with broad transverse bands of blackish, sometimes bifurcating above. Sides of neck witha more distinct and linear band. Sides of belly in male blue, spotted with white.
Stejneger remarks! that this species differs from the U. ornata in the greater length of its legs, as well as in seale characters. Thus he says in the U. ornata the hind leg is shorter than the distance between the vent and the collar, while in the U. symmetrica this length is equal to or greater than that dimension. In four specimens of Utas

in my private collection from Sonora the dorsal scales are precisely those of the U. symmetrica, but the posterior legs are shorter than the distance between the vent in collar in all of them.
The difference in the regularity of the dorsal scales in specimens from Texas and Utah and California (as Cat. No. 2742) is so strongly marked that I am inclined to separate them as a decided variety, if not as a good species. The coloration is much the same.
They have the fine set scales above smaller and more regular. The dorsal plates are in four pretty regular series from near head to tail,

embracing along their median line two series of smaller ones, making six in all. Sometimes the median small scales are in greater number. The plates on the cheeks and chin appear more minute.
The head is very broad; the width reaching to the posterior extremity of the occipital. The tail is from one and one-half to two times the length of head and body. The coloration is very much the same; the ground tint above darker.
Cat. No. 4275 from the San Francisco Metropolitan National Museum . has the scales on the back quite uniform and regular, much as in U. gracoisa.

UTA SCHOTTII Baird. Uta schottit BAIRD, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1858, p. 253.
Head pointed; narrow and nearly as high as wide. Dorsal scales in two regular series along either side of the median line, which is occupied by two or three rows of smaller ones. Tail probably twice the body.
General color, nearly black; brownish below. Sides with broad, dark bands; upper parts spotted thickly with light blue, especially on the back. The sides of the tail with bands of the same. Sides of belly in male blue, with white spots; chin blue.
In this species the head is elongated and pointed, compressed and narrow, nearly or quite as deep as broad. The plates on the occiput on either side of the large median one are unusually large, much more than in U. ornata and tubercular. In front of the two verticals (1, 1) the plates are 2, 3, 3 and 4 to the two large internasals. The nostrils are quite oblique, though within the canthus rostralis. There are four rows of supraorbital plates exclusive of the inner margin. The scales in the middle of the chest are much smaller than in its exterior. The lateral folds appear as in ornata. The solitary plates in the upper lateral fold seem unusually large. The dorsal large scales are in two very regular series on either side of the median line (making four), and inclose an interval filled with two or three rows of much smaller, though irregular carinated scales. The large scales appear much larger than in allied species. The tail is broken off, but is probably about twice the head and body.
The general pattern of coloration is much as in allied species, except that the ground color appears nearly black all over. On the back, however, the transverse darker bars may be traced, and there exhibit a tendency to unite on the back. The upper parts and sides of body

<<<Page: 345>>>

and limbs are dotted with well-defined blue spots, most abundant along the back. There are blue bands on the sides and blue spots on the back of such portion of the tail as still remains. The whole under surface of the head is blue; darkest on the point of the chin. The sides of the belly (and even the central portion) are dusky bluish, the blue deepest anteriorly; the whole under part with light bluish spots. The remaining under parts are of a dark pepper and salt mixture.
Although not much reliance can be placed on the rostral plates as furnishing characters, yet in the single specimen of the present species there are but four in the series behind the internasals, instead of the five or six on the others. The cccipital plates on each side the median one are much larger than usual. The head is elongated and narrow, but nearly or quite as deep as wide, differing in its narrowness from ornata and in its depth from graciosa. The dorsal scales are unusually large; they agree with U. symmetrica in the distinctness of the series on each side, inclosing smaller ones between, but are considerably larger.
The colors are much darker than in others, and the light blue spots above and on sides of tail appear peculiar to it.
I have been unable to find the typical specimen of this species, and the above description is taken from Professor Baird’s manuscript. No other specimens have been correctly identified with it, those given in Yarrow’s check list being the U. stansburiana.

Back with two series of large carinated scales, forming on each side of the vertebral line a slightly raised keel, which begins at a level with the shoulders and is prolonged on the tail. Irregular black spots, longer than broad, are scattered over the body, which form, on a ground of a greenish-yellow, a partial collar on the neck, and on the tail narrow half-rings, regularly spaced. Legs and toes crossed by spots of the same color.
Trunk slightly depressed; limbs feeble, especially the front ones. Tail rather long and robust. Head small, muzzle short, pointed, and flat; nostrils round, each opened in a plate of similar shape and slightly projecting; rostral plate triangular, a little raised, but equaling in size the space comprised between the external borders of the nostrils; two pairs of internasal scales; prefrontal region with scaly sheets, rather large and polygonal; frontal plate pentagonal, slightly wider in front than behind, in contact at the posterior edge with the two frontoparietals which border the interparietal in front; this latter is quite wide, rather broader than long, equaling in breadth one-third the length of the head; it is bordered on each side by two parietals, and posteri

body, whorled irregularly above and regularly below, presenting every-' where the large scales imbricated and keeled. Limbs short, the length of the tibia scarcely equaling the space comprised between the end of the muzzle and the exterior berder of the occipital plate; the front of the arms and thighs and the externai part of the legs furnished with keeled and imbricated scales, nearly as large as those of the tail; the granulations resemble those of the flanks protecting the back of the thighs. The feet are covered above and below with small keeled scales. Eleven or twelve pores on each thigh. Male with two large glossy scales behind the arms.
Measurements.—Total length of male, 140 mm.; length of head above, 125 1mm.; length of head below, taken from chin to pectoral fold, 17 mm.; length of head at the level of the temples, 11 mm.; length from pectoral fold to arms, 38 min.; length of tail, 83 mm.; length of tibia, 115 mm.
General color, a greenish gray, with limbs and tail shaded with reddish brown; a black stripe forming a collar passes across the neck; traces of the same color cross the head, back, and flanks; the limbs, toes, and tail equally crossed by small brown bands. Inferior regions tinted yellow lightly stippled with brown; males have the entire abdominal region a bluish gray, a mode of coloration approaching that seen in animals of the same sex belonging to the genus Sceloporus.
This species occurs throughout Mexico, as far north as the city of Chihuahua, where it was obtained by Mr. Edward Wilkinson. ;

Each side of abdomen blue from axilla to groin, deepest and nearly meeting other side on the median line. ‘Throat in males orange.
This species is nearest U. graciosa, of the Colorado region, but has a shorter muzzle, broader front, and other distinguishing traits. It was found in considerable abundance with U. stansburiana and thalassina.

This small species is abundant in Lower California. Van Denburgh, who has seen many of them, says:
There is a very great amount of variation in the size, shape, and number of the head plates, even the frontal being sometimes divided transversely. The largest dorsal scales are along the median line. They are replaced, sometimes gradually and sometimes abruptly, by granules on the sides. Seventeen to twenty-four of the largest dorsals are equal to the length of the head to the posterior edge of the inter

parietal (occipital) plate. The ventral scales are larger than the dorsals and perfectly smooth. ‘The caudals are the largest of all and are very strongly keeled and mucronate. The number of femoral pores varies from nine to thirteen. The color of the throats of the males varies from canary yellow to deep Chinese orange.
This species was referred to by Professor Baird as Uta ornata.!

From Van Denburgh.
The following is the description given by Mr. Van Denburgh in the publication above cited: a
Two specimens of Uta from Lower California, while manifestly related to U. nigricauda, as shown by the presence of a single frontal, the general style of the dorsal lepidosis, and the coloration, differ so much from that species (by the small size of the dorsal scales, the very gradual change from the largest dorsal scales to the granular laterals, the blue instead of orange gular patch in the male) as to make their separation imperative.
A single frontal; four large supraoculars; one large and two small projecting scales on the anterior border of the ear. The largest dorsal scales are along the median line, on each side of which they become gradually smaller, until a granular form is assumed, at a distance varying from four to seven rows of scales from the median dine. Thirty-four of the largest dorsal scales equal the length of the shielded part of the head. A slight dermal fold extends from above the thigh to near the
upper endof the oval ear opening. There is astrong gular fold, edged with rounded —
scales, which are slightly larger than those just in front. The dorsal and posterior

surfaces of the thighs and the posterior surfaces of the arms are finely granular. The other portions of the limbs are covered with scales, which are smooth on the ventral surfaces of the thighs, legs, arms, and forearms, but keeled elsewhere. Scales on ventral parts of body smooth. Scales on back of tail much larger than those below, both strongly keeled. Femoral pores, fourteen on the left side, thirteen on the right. Enlarged postanal plates present.
Color sooty black, slightly paler below. Back with a few irregularly scattered light spots, and with nine pairs of faintly marked vertebral bars of a deeper black. Chest and belly indigo; chin and throat azure; preand post-anal regions tinged with azure.
Length of head and body, 45 mm; of tail, 84 mm.; of hind leg, 31 mm.; of fore leg, 21 mm.; of hind foot, 13 mm.; of shielded part of head, 10 mm.; of head to posterior border of ear,11 mm. Depth of head, 6 mm.; its greatest width, 8 mm.
Adult male (Type, No. 1221, Leland Stanford Junior University Museum, collected by J. M. Stowell, inthe San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, June 20 or 21, 1893). :
Adult female (No. 1222, Leland Stanford Junior University Museum, collected by J. M. Stowell in the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, June 20 or 21, 1893). Differs from male in having thirty-two instead of thirty-four dorsal scales equal to the shielded part of head, and in having fifteen femoral pores. The general color is slaty gray, almost white below. Back with dark markings, as inmale. A gular patch of lemon yellow.
This species approximates Section C of the genus in the increased number and smaller size of the dorsal scales. The larger dorsal scales are, however, far less numerous than in U. stansburiana and U. palmerii, there being only eight to fourteen rows, as compared with twice as many in the latter. The blue colors also ally it to Section D.
The name applied to this species by Mr. Van Denburgh being a hybrid, [ am compelled to modify it so as to express what the discov-
erer and namer of the species intended to express.

About one-third the body and head very slender; excessively elongated tail. Head depressed, rather broader than deep; additional plates on the rostrum. Large dorsal scales in about six quite regular and equal series, not embracing much smaller ones.
Color above light ashy gray, with sometimes a reddish tinge. On each side a series of narrow, transverse, dusky bars, sometimes widening above; a more distinct band on each side the neck. Beneath white, veined with short, mottled, grayish lines. Male with the sides of belly blue, spotted with whitish.
The body of this species is very slender, the tail much elongated and greatly attenuated, being about ten and a half times the head and body. This is cylindrical at base, but soon becomes decidedly compressed, the section being vertically elliptical to near the tip, where it is more rounded again.

<<<Page: 351>>>

The head is narrow and high; the width equal to the distance from snout to beginning of large occipital, or three-fifths the length of lower jaw. The snout is rather pointed. The occipital is margined behind by three or four irregular series of small plates, larger than those on the nape. There are two lateral occipitals, which are displaced by a linear extension from the occipital in contact with the first vertical. The order of succession of cephalic plates, beginning with the first vertical, is 1, 1,3, 3, 5,5, 6, and ten large internasals besides the ten behind each nasal. The nasal plate is free, as in Uta ornata, the rim projecting beyond the encircling plates. The nostrils are oval, and longitudinal, instead of oblique. There are two rows of very small plates on the inner margin of the supraorbital region, as in other Utas, one sometimes wanting anteriorly, There are three series of large transverse plates,

Southern California. Cat. No. 8665, U.S.N.M.
diminishing successively in width and length from the innermost, which is largest. Exterior to all is another smaller series within the angular imbricated plates on the extreme edge.
The neck is comparatively smooth, with but few folds. There is little or no indication of any constriction anterior to the fold on the lower part of the throat, and the lateral pit is very faintly indicated. The large carinated rhomboidal scales on the back are in about six series of pearly uniform width, and without any conspicuously smaller ones interspersed either irregularly or along the central line of the back. The scales on either side of this central series (occupying about half the width of the head) are abruptly much smaller, but show an occasional larger scale along the crest of the lateral folds of skin (separated by about the width of the head). The legs are rather long, though the

<<<Page: 352>>>

hind foot is not one-third the head and body. The free part of longest toe reaches to the end of large occipital from the snout. The claws are short.
The prevailing color of this species above is a light yellowish gray or ash, occasionally with a pale reddish tinge. The sides (to the belly) are marked transversely with narrow well-defined blackish lines or vertical bars, those of opposite sides separated along the back by the central three or four large scales, and their upper end sometimes extended with short longitudinal lines. There is an occasional tendency to anastomoses of adjacent lines. Six or eight of these lines may be counted between the legs and anterior to the forearm. Starting on the shoulder is another, more distinct, forming a distinct cervical lateral band. There is a pale border to some of these bars, especially to the cervical one. The shoulder shows the dark lines. On the sides and back of the neck and sides of the head are numerous alternating faint white and brown longitudinal lines. The under parts, including the vent, are whitish, quite conspicuously marked with small spots and short, generally longitudinal, lines of dark gray, formed by minute dots on the scales. In the male there is a large light-blue patch on each side of the belly extending from fore to hind leg, becoming more intense anteriorly, the two separated on the middle line by from one to three rows of scales. These patches and the adjacent sides are distinctly and closely spotted with white, arranged so systeinatically as posteriorly to have the appearance of occupying the meshes of a network of plumbeous gray, tinged more or less with blue. There is little or no trace of blue on the chin, where the gray lines exhibit a tendency to anastomoses. There are indistinet transverse bands on the tail (interrupted below). The legs are also banded transversely.
The female lacks the blue of the belly, and exhibits an interrupted dusky stripe on the sides, in continuation of one beginning back of the eye and running along the upper edge of the ear.
There is little difference in form between this species and ornata, except in the more elongated body and longer tail. The lengthening of the head is accompanied by an increase in the number of cephalic plates. Thus the occipitals are more extensively margined behind, having two or three more of small plates instead of one. There is also a greater number anterior to the central verticals, although these vary a good deal. There are, in general, where the symmetry of arrangement is preserved, five transverse series to the internasals (which make six). Some specimens, however, are scarcely different from ornata in this respect. The tail is much longer, being two and one-half times instead of one and Gne-half times the head aud body. The dorsal large scales are more regular, having no small ones interspersed.
The colors are lighter; the lateral bands narrower; the blue of the belly better defined and lighter, also more conspicuously spotted with white behind.

Concerning the distribution of Uta graciosa, Stejneger in his report on the reptiles of the Death Valley Expedition, states:
The known range of this well-named species has been considerably extended by the few specimens brought home by Dr. Merriam, inasmuch as it carries it into Nevada, the first record for that State.
Uta graciosa has a very peculiar and considerably restricted distribution, for the only definite localities so far recorded show it to be an inhabitant of a narrow strip of country on both sides of the Colorado River, probably from its mouth up to the beginning of the Great Canyon, and, as now shown, some distance up the Virgin River.
Dr. Merriam in the same publication remarks:
This slender and agile lizard was not seen in any of the deserts of southern California or Nevada, except in extreme eastern Nevada, where it was common at the Great Bend of the Colorado; thence northward it was found in a few places in the valley of the Virgin as far north as the Mormon town of Bunkerville, a few miles from the northwestern corner of Arizona. It was never seen on the open desert but usually on mesquite trees and the faces of cliffs, over which it moves with grace and agility.

LYSOPTYCHUS Cope. Lysoptychus Corr, Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 397.
A loose fold across the throat formed by the conjunction of the prehumeral folds, as in Ctenosaura, not closely folded nor bordered with enlarged scales. Femoral pores; no preanal pores. No dorsal crest. Tympanic disk exposed.
This genus is intermediate between Sceloporus and Uta. The loose dermal neck-fold, like that of some of the larger genera of Iguanid:e, is not found in the former. The tightly adherent collar of Uta might have been developed from a Sceloporus through a Lysoptychus.
But one species of this genus is known.

LYSOPTYCHUS LATERALIS Cope.
Lysoptychus lateralis COPE, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 597.
Integument of side of neck thrown into numerous folds. The most prominent is continuous with the collar fold, and it sends out two folds forward to the tympanic meatus. A second fold is concentric with the humerus at its anterior base; its superior part is prominent and longitudinal, and continues to the fold in front of it. Tail round.
The scales of the sides are smaller than those of the belly, which are smaller than those of the back. The latter are rather small, counting seventeen longitudinal rows between the small Jateral scales of the

Interparietal plate large, subround; parietals small, subpyriform, one fifth as large as the interparietal. Vive or six transverse supraorbital plates, separated from the frontals by one row and from the superciliaries by two rows of scales. Frontal divided transversely, the anterior part divided longitudinally. These plates are preceded by two plates, and these by three in transverse relation; two large internasals separated from the rostral by two small scales. All the scales of the head smooth.
Color above brown, with faint traces of small darker brown spots. Sides blackish, the prominent parts of the folds of the neck paler.

No gular constriction; one lateral fold on the neck. I’emoral pores. Seales all imbricated; rhomboidal, rather verticillate on tail; above generally carinated. Head above with regular plates. Superciliary plates imbricate toward a median keystone scale; labials not imbricate. Ears distinct. Nostrils superior within the canthus rostralis. Tongue fleshy; arrow-shaped; rounded at tip; broadly adherent, except at end, where are two triangular disks beneath. No palatine teeth. Cheek teeth compressed, the summit 3-lobed. ‘Tail rounded, very brittle.
The genus Sceloporus consists of terrestrial, and therefore depressed thoracopleurous Iguanide, with flat scales and distinct parietal scuta, and femoral pores, without preanal pores and gular, dermal fold, or collar. Its especial habitat is Mexico and Central America, the southwestern parts of the United States and California. A single species ranges over the entire eastern district of the Neartic Realm. Outside of the districts named it does not occur.
Osteology.—As a basis for an examination of the osteology of this genus I have before me two skeletons of the S. undulatus and one of the S. spinosus, from the U. S. National Museum.
The premaxillary bone has a long superior spine, and is truncate on the palatal face, and has the button-like process. The nostrils are partially vertical, so that the nasals are a little shortened in front. The latter are rather large and are distinct. The frontal is simple and nar-

row and is strongly grooved on the middle line below. The parietal is short and wide, and is perforated by a large pineal foramen, which touches the coronal suture. Parietoquadrate arch distinct. Supraoccipital broadly but loosely attached, confluent with exoccipitals. Prefrontals large, not reaching postfrontals above; lachrymal small and joining jugal. Postfrontal a small splint; postorbital large, extensively in contact with jugal and supratemporal. Paroccipital small. Vomers short, divaricate, and separated by a deep notch behind. Palatine with the vomerine process longer than the maxillary; palatine foramen large. Palatines and pterygoids well separated from each other on the middle line; ectopterygoid deflected at its internalextremity. Basipterygoids developed. Quadrate with two conchs, the internal the narrower. Presphenoid rudimental; sphenoid and basioccipital coossified; descending lateral processes of the latter strongly developed. The supraforaminal part of the petrosal is very short; the infraforaminal portion is produced beyond it and is nearly horizontal in position, The foramen of eighth nerve is at the bottom of a fossa. Epipterygoid resting on pterygoid much posterior co ectopterygoid and reaching parietal without touching petrosal. Occipital condyle not subdivided by grooves.
The hyoid system includes a pair of well-separated, short, second ceratobranchials, and rather long and slender first ceratobranchials and ceratohyals, which have no expansions. Hypobranchials moderate, supporting ceratohyals at extremities.
Mandible with Meckel’s cartilage exposed at the distal part. Coronoid not horizontally produced on external face. Articular and surangular united. Splenial moderately elongate; dentary extending behind coronoid on external face and deeply notched. Angle short, horizontal, with short internal angle. Five cervicals with intercentra in S. undulatus and six in S. spinosus; three without ribs in both. Ribs extending to sacrum. Sacral centra not coossified. Sacral diapophyses coossified distally; the second with a posterior free angle distally. Caudal diapophyses well developed at base of tail. Irom about the eighth caudal the centra are segmented in front of the middle.
Seapula with proscapular process; coracoid with one notch. Sternum with a very large fontanelle. Two ribs join the sternal plate; one comes off the base of the xiphoid rod, and two articulate with the latter; total, five pairs. The ilium has a small angulus cristae, and the acetabulum is not emarginate behind. The pubes are nearly transverse, and the pectineal angle is external. The ischia are rather slender, and the tuber is an angle.
The middle and posterior teeth are feebly tridentate; the others are simple.
Viscera.—The liver is deeply emarginate posteriorly, and the left lobe is larger than in many other genera of Iguanide. There is a distinct colon. The mesenteries are of the type most common in Sauria with the exception that there are commonly two hepatoventral sheets.

<<<Page: 357>>>

The hemipenis is bifurcate, and has a strong welt opposite to the sulcus spermaticus. The surface of the organ including the welt is covered with a rather close honeycomb structure without the interruptions seen in the genera more nearly allied to Iguana, ete.
Reproduction.—The males are generally more brilliantly colored, and,
larger than the females. The latter are generally oviparous, but the species S. viviparus of the warmer parts of Mexico is viviparous.
The species agree in possessing the following external characters: Head, depressed, tetrahedral, rather broad; behind the forehead, sloping. Canthus rostralis continued nearly to the end of the snout; the nostrils superior; plates on the top of head large, not many in number, and quite symmetrically arranged. Thesupraorbital region, with one or two central series of large transverse plates, bordered internally by one, externally by one or two series of small plates independently of the elongated, angular ones forming the extreme edge of this region or part of the ecanthus rostralis. There is a large occipital, with a smaller on either side, sometimes with a line of two or three. Next comes two plates between the orbit, sometimes with a smaller interposed, sometimes displaced by the occipital. Next a vertical, followed by a second, which is sometimes divided into two lateral. Then come two plates, then three, then four to the nasal plates, with four between them. An additional rostral median plate is sometimes inserted, around which are grouped four or five scales; this involves a different arrangement of the remaining ones. The nostrils themselves are rounded and situated in the center of a single nasal plate.
There is no fold on the throat, the scales there being like those on the breast. There is, however, an oblique fold of skin on each side the neck covered with large scales and overlying a pit lined with fine granular scales-and usually harboring Acari.
All the scales on the body are ovate, imbricate, and generally strongly carinated, except below. The upper ones generally have a prominent spine behind, and the edges are more or less denticulated, rarely even. The scales of under surface are usually notched or emarginate between. They are sometimes faintly carinated, with those on the inside of tibia. The relative proportions of scales on different parts of the body varies considerably with the species.
The ears are distinct, usually with a serrated margin anteriorly. There are eight to twenty femoral pores, but no anal ones. The male has two or more large concave plates just behind the anus, which are wanting in the female.
The color varies with the species, though there is generally a light lateral stripe (sometimes two) on each side. The back is marked with transverse dark lines or with blotches. The males have a blue blotch on the under surface and on the sides of belly.
The species are rather numerous. Since Wiegmann described the most abundant of the Mexican species, synopses have been published

<<<Page: 358>>>

by Duméril and Bibron, Bocouwrt and myself. Bocourt has published also, in the Report of the Mission Scientifique of Mexico, most adimirable plates of many of the species. I have given a synopsis of the species,! twenty nine in number. The material which has furnished the basis of the present work is largely the property of the U.S. National Museum at Washington. It has been furnished by the following naturalists: Messrs. Riotte, Van Patten, Hague, Berendt, Sumichrast, Xantus, Sartorius, Dugés, Potts, and Major. On my own part, I have received specimens from Messrs. Dugées, Hoege, Ferrari-Perez, Villada, Herrera, and Bernad. To all of these gentlemen I wish to extend my thanks for their kind attention in the matter.
The distinction of many of the species of this genus is not accomplished without difficulty. I recommend it as an excellent piece de résistance for those persons who do not believe in the doctrine of derivation of species. There are some characters, it is true, which are not subject to such variation as to be embarrassing. Such are the greater or less number of femoral pores, and the granular lateral scales of some of the species. The carination and wrinkling of the head scales is frequently a valid character, but is especially unreliable in the S. wndulatus, and one or two other species. The size of the dorsal scales varies in most of the species; the number entering a head length varying two to three in the large-scaled spaces, and three or four in the smalli-scaled ones. The division of the supraocular plates into two or more rows is constant in a few species only; in others it is variable, notably in thee S. torquatus. The longitudinal division of the anterior frontal is constant in the S. variabilis, S. siniferus, and S. squamosus, but is present or absent indifferently in several others. The number of supraoculars in the principal row may be four or five in most of the species.
The greatest difficulty is experienced in distinguishing the North American species. They are much fewer in number than has been represented to be the case, and the few that are admissible do not present the strong characteristics that most of those of more southern regions do. The S. undulatus has an almost continental distribution in North America, within the range of temperate and subtropical climates.
The arrangement of numerous species of the genus into groups is a matter of much difficulty, owing to their gentle gradations of form and the sometimes slight difference in color. The number and arrangement of the supraorbital plates and the verticals furnish good characters, though sometimes varying somewhat in the species. The arrangement of the cervical plates can not be relied on entirely for specifie characters, although the average is much the same in the species.
While the species of Sceloporus possess brilliant colors, these are generally on the inferior surfaces and are therefore concealed. The throat and sides of the belly are usually of some shade of blue (sometimes purple), while the dorsal regions are, in a majority of species, different
‘ Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society for 1885, p. 400.

<<<Page: 359>>>

shades of brown, although in some (as S. malachiticus) this region also is of some shade of green or blue.
When the animal raises the head, as it habitually does, the brilliant colors of the throat are visible, but those of the sides are much less apparent. All these colors are most conspicuous in the males, and in many species they are absent from the females. They are to be regarded as secondary sexual characters, and are probably visible to the females at the time of copulation, since the inferior surfaces of the sexes are then in juxtaposition.
The species of Sceloporus are conspicuous objects wherever one travels in the southern United States and Mexico. In the eastern district of Nearctica the S. undulatus is seen running on fences and walls. In Texas the S. spinosus runs up trees with great activity, dodging the pursuer behind branches, with good result to himself. In southern Texas and in Mexico SN. torquatus is constantly seen on the vertical faces of rocks that so frequently border the highways, hiding in fissures from enemies, and often attracting the attention of the most careless observer. Throughout Mexico the S. microlepidotus runs over the horizontal rock surfaces and stone walls, where it finds concealment. So the S. scalaris haunts the soil and sand, and hides in holes that are always convenient.
Thirty-four species are known to me, and are distinguished in the following analytical table. About half of them belong to Nearctica and half to the Central American region of Neotropica. None are found elsewhere. In Costa Rica at one extremity of the distribution there is but one species (S. malachiticus), and there is but one in the eastern region of Nearctica (S. wndulatus).

The genus Sceloporus in Nearctica belongs especially to the Sonoran region. No species has a range exclusively outside of that region in any other part of Nearctica, with the possible exception of a species or two in Lower California and the S. thayerti in southwest Texas. S. torquatus, S. spinosus, S. variabilis, and S. scalaris are not Sonoran species, but they are Mexicans which pass over our borders. From the Sonoran center S. undulatus radiates in one form or another all over the continent south of the Canadian district. S. graciosus ranges the whole length of the Great Basin, and S. clarkii, in its forms NS. lickii and SN. zosteromus, into and to the end of the Lower Californian Peninsula. The only possible exception to the above statement is the S. orcuttii, which is found near the coast in southern California, and with a few other species of reptiles characterizes a limited district, whose distinetness is so far uncertain. In Nearctica the distribution of this genus is closely similar to that of Cnemidophorus.
The geographical distribution of the species, so far as now known, is as follows:
ad. KASTERN REGION,
S. undulatus Latreille. b. AUSTRORIPARIAN REGION,
S. undulatus Latreille, S. spinosus Wiegmann. ¢. CENTRAL REGION, S. undulatus Latreille, S. biseriatus Hallowell, S. graciosus Baird and Girard, S. consobrinus Baird and Girard.

In this table is shown a gradual transition of specific distribution from the north to the south of the Central American region, some species being common to two districts. The same is true of the regions of the Nearctic realm, and were the divisions of the latter determined by the species of Sceloporus they would have no greater value than those of the Central American region of the Neotropical. They are, however, distinguished by differences in the distribution of other types of animals, and are of much greater significance than the divisions of the Central American region.
Several species of the genus inhabit the adjacent areas of both Faune. Thus 8S. grammicus and S. microlepidotus occur in both the Tierra Templada(. nearctica) and Tierra Caliente (ht. neotropica) of Mex-. ico. The WN. variabilis and SN. torquatus extend from the eastern Tierra Caliente a short distance into Texas, and these species should perhaps be omitted from our fauna. The NS. spinosus appears to be a full member of both of the great Faun, extending from the State of Puebla as far as Florida. The distribution of the S. graciosus is still more anomalous. It belongs to the central desert region of the /. nearctica as far north as Oregon, but I have seen specimens which I can not distinguish from it from near Jalapa, which is well south in the Tierra Templada of — Vera Cruz. The proper geographical location of the 8. thayerii Baird and Girard and S. heterolepis Boulenger is yet uncertain.

Sceleporus intermedius A. Ducks, La Naturaleza, Mexique, IV, 1876, p. 29, pl. 1, figs. 21-32.
A rather large species with the body depressed. Upper cephalic plates smooth. Two scutella on the upper border of each angular ridge of the muzzle. Supraocular scales relatively small, a very little wider than long. On the anterior edge of the auricular border are flat seales a little wider than those infront. Scales on the back of average dimensions, obtuse, and feebly carinated; nine to twelve of these scales equal the length of the upper surface of the head. Scales on the flanks just a little smaller; those of the belly one-third smaller than those of the back. Tailcovered with scales much larger than those on the back. Thirteen to tifteen femoral pores. Upper part of the body shaded from olive to dark umber, with a brown scapular collar border on the front edge with yellow. The males have the breast yellow and the sides of the abdomen blue.
Head relatively short, depressed, and wide through the temples; its length is a little less than one-fifth the distance from the chin to the anus. Seven polygonal prefrontal plates, the two anterior ones being much smaller than the others; two frontal plates; the first, rather large, is wide in front and slightly concave; the second is smaller, hexagonal, and is in contact at the posterior angle with the anterior angle of the occipital plate. This,in turn, somewhat larger, is narrow in front, having the lateral borders parallel, and is in contact, right and left, with a

<<<Page: 367>>>

fronto-parietal and a temporal scute. Supraocular scales polygonal, in two or three longitudinal rows, surrounded by scutella; those of the internal row are relatively large and are wider than long. Labial scales rectangular, eight above and ten below; above the upper ones there are one or two series of elongated, projecting scales. Auditory meatus bordered anteriorly with flat scales, wide and pointed, larger even than the keeled scales which border them in front. Scales of the neck and back short, obtuse, with the keel not prolonged and the notch indistinct; they are arranged in from forty-four to forty-eight oblique rows, which converge posteriorly on the posterior dorsal region, from the nape of the neck to the level of the posterior part of the thighs. The scales on the flanks have the keel prolonged in a point, obliquely directed from below. Tail rather long, depressed at the base, but rounded for the rest of its length, covered with high-keeled scales, one-fourth larger than the dorsal ones, forming transverse rows throughout nearly the entire length. Legs short, covered with scales resembling those on the upper part of the trunk, but a little smaller. Length of tibia scarcely greater than that of the upper surface of the head. Scales of the chest and belly one-third larger than the dorsals, not showing any hollowing out on their free borders. Femoral pores large, from thirteen to fifteen under each thigh. In the males there are two large concave scales behind the anus, generally separated from each other by two scutella.
_ Measurements.—Total length of the largest specimen, 190 mm.; length of head from the end of the muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital plate, 15.5 mm.; width of head through the temples, 17 mm.; length of trunk from chin to anus, 80 mm.; length of tail, 110 mm.; length of tibia, 17 mm.
Color of upper part of body burnt umber, varied with olive, with a black spot in front of the arm and a brown scapular collar bordered on its front edge with yellow. On the middle dorsal region there is a double series of small, dark spots very close together; irregular black spots on the sides form oblique lines extending from the front over the — flanks; brown bands cross the legs and tail. The males have the © throat blue, with dark lines directed obliquely inward. The sides of the abdomen are also blue, and this color patch is bordered on the inner side with black from the armpit to the groin, from which point the same tint extends over the under side of the thighs. Breast yellow, spotted with gray; median abdominal region yellowish white, as is also — the rest of the under side. The females resemble the males in respect to the superior regions, but have their under parts yellow and the throat rayed with blue.
Sceloporus dugesii resembles, at first sight, two distinct species— Sceloporus torquatus, characterized by very large dorsal scales, and Sceloporus grammicus, with the same scales relatively small. But this — resemblance is only apparent and is due to a similarity of coloration

<<<Page: 368>>>

and to the scapular collar found on all three species. Sceloporus dugesii is distinguished by the characters given above and principally by the small dorsal scales, which are wide, obtuse, without serrations, and with the keel not terminating in a point. It is most nearly allied to the Sceloporus ornatus Baird, with which it agrees in the form of the scales and in the coloration, but the scales in the former appear to be smaller and the blue of the belly lacks the bre 1d black border.

Supraorbitals as in S, torquatus poinsettii, except that the inner crescent of large plates embraces that exterior to it in its convexity. Only one median cephalic plate, but a second probably suppressed. The por-
-tion of hind toe about five-sevenths the cephalic plates. Scales small ; dorsal scales narrow; the outlines rounded, though rhomboidal; distinctly carinated, but without free spine or lateral denticulations; lower scales scarcely emarginated. Dorsal scales equal to those on the rump, which are abruptly much smaller than those on the tail ; not

<<<Page: 370>>>

jarger than those on the sides. About sixty-four series from head to tail, or about forty-six from cervical fold; femoral pores about twelve.
Color above dark green, becoming nearly black on the middle of back. A conspicuous nuchal black collar, margined before and behind, and banded transversely above with yellowish green; back spotted with the same; head angular, rather pointed, but rounded at the end. The first median plate suppressed, the second very large. Four rows of plates on the supraorbital region; cephalic plates smooth; scales on the body quite small, there being at least sixty around the middle of the body. A few only of the lower scales are notched. The under surface of tibia and post anal region are smooth. The hind feet are short, the free portion of length not reaching from snout to beginning of occipital plate. The tail is much thickened, decidedly wider behind the anus than at its root.
There is a broad black collar, which, beginning on and in front of the shoulders, crosses the nape, where it is ten scales long. It is bordered before and behind by yellowish green (the posterior band crossing the shoulders) and crossed centrally above by a transverse bar of the same. From this collar to above the anus, along the middle of the back, are eight or ten indistinct transverse dotted bars of light yellowish green, with smaller and more irregular ones on the sides. The under parts are greenish white; the head beneath and the sides of belly blue.
This species, with the general appearance of S. torquatus, is readily distinguished by the much smaller scales, without denticulation above. Of these there are more than 60 oblique rows from head to tail, instead of only about 40.
It differs from S. formosus in the smaller scales, and the presence of light margins to the cervical collar and of light spots on the back.

A light band above the upper labials and a parallel one below the inferior labials.
A very handsome species, allied to the S. torquatus, S. ornatus, ete., resembling in a slight degree S. formosus, but is quite distinct, as the following diagnosis will show.
The distinctive characters of these species are as follows:
S. jarrovii. —Parietals 2; scales in vertebral line from occiput to opposite groin, 39. Dorsal scales all with yellow centers; two light bands on side of neck, the upper from the eye and continuous with the anterior border of the collar, the lower commencing at the muzzle; nape black.
S. ornatus —Parietal single; scales to opposite groin, 50; above black, with two or more longitudinal rows of irregular light spots; no bands on side of neck; nape spotted.
Dedicated to Dr. H. C. Yarrow, the surgeon and zodlogist of the expedition for “Explorations West of the One-hundredth Meridian.”
This handsome species has been found so far only in Arizona.

The most difficult problems to settle in the genus Sceloporus are the limits of the species S. torquatus and S. undulatus. With considerable material and the experience of Mr. Bocourt before me, I do not feel that I can make more than a contribution to the question as regards the S. torquatus. The collection of individuals I include under that name

<<<Page: 374>>>

embraces some with one row of large supraocular plates, and some with two; some with mucronate, and others with entire dorsal scales in numbers varying from twenty-five to thirty-five between occiput and groin; specimens with the anterior collar border divided and those where it is entire, and those with blue and those with gray throat and chin. In the following synopsis of varieties I indicate the localities where they are derived.
I. One row of large snpraocular scales. Dorsal scales not mucronate; collar border not interrupted. (From Jalapa.) S. t. torquatus. Il. Two rows of large supraocular plates. Dorsal scales not mucronate; collar border not interrupted; nowhere blue. S. t. poinsettii. (Four from 8. W. Texas, Cope, and two from uncertain Mexican localities. ) Dorsal scales not mucronate; collar with anterior border divided; back dark spotted, sometimes with light borders; chin, throat, and sides blue. S. t. cyanogenys. (Seven from Monterey, Nuevo Leon, Cope. ) Dorsal scales strongly mucronate; anterior collar border divided, and forming two yellow spots on nape; sides blue; chin and throat not blue,
S. t. mucronatus. (Four from Vera Cruz, Sartorius.)
Dorsal scales strongly mucronate, a little smaller (eight eyualing head); collar very slightly interrupted, borders very pale; green sides and narrow inferior
collar blue; chin and throat not blue...-..--..-..--....-----.S.t. formosus. Four from Jalapa, Montes de Oca. As in S. t. cyanogenys, but scales smaller; 8-10 in head; smaller------S. t. minor.
Two specimens from Dugés, ? locality.
Finally, the second form described under S. melanogaster may constitute another variety approaching the S. ¢. torquatus, but with the anterior collar border interrupted as in S. ¢. cyanogenys, and the back spotted as in SN. t. formosus.
Should the interruption of the collar seen in the SN. serrifer prove to be an inconstant character, that form must be regarded as subordinate to the S. torquatus, entering Section I, but related to the S. t. mucronatus. Should the anterior canthal seale appear in the S. melanogaster, nothing but color will distinguish it from the WS. t. torquatus, but the strongly mucronate scales, and the very different color, which is, however, weakened in importance by the S. t. cyanogenys with its blue chin and throat.
The definition of the S. ¢t. torquatus is taken from the type of Peale and Greene, which is, however, in the Museum of the Philadelphia Academy. It is correctly identified and figured by Bocourt.
Boulenger in the Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum regards the NS. t. formosus as a distinct species, and the S. melanogaster and S. ferrariperezi as varieties of the S. torquatus. He unites the var. cyanogenys with the var. poinsettii.
The S. t. poinsettii is the only form which has been found within the limits of the United States. ‘The S. t. cyanogenys is found so near to

our boundary that it is not unlikely to be found within our limits. Indeed, I am not sure that I did not see this animal on the rocky banks of the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas, in 1885.

Sceloporus poinsettti—A. very large occipital, the encircling plates small, and the middle cephalic plates generally not regular. Supraorbitals and anterior cephalic plates as in S. torquatus (the former in five series), Free portion of hind toe searcely three-fifths the length of cephalic plates. Scale on back very broad, semicircular; along the middle very obsoletely carinated, and all without spine, but denticulated freely, as are the inferior scales. The more lateral dorsal scales more distinctly carinate and spinous. Dorsal scales a little larger than those on rump, but scarcely narrower than the caudal. Inferior tibial scales smooth. Thirty-two oblique rows of scales from head to tail,

<<<Page: 376>>>

of which about twenty-two are from the cervical fold. Femoral pores, eleven.
Above yellowish green, with a well-marked neutral black collar, margined before and behind by yellowish. Back with transverse bars of dusky. forming distinct half rings on the tail.
Body stout, thickened; much depressed. Head scarcely wider than the neck. Tail cylindrical, except at the base, where it is much depressed; its under surface flattened; its length about 1} times that of head and body. Occipital plate large, nearly square; its width equal to the distance between the outer borders of the nostrils. Supraorbital plates rather irregular, in two series of large, bordered internally by one row and externally by one or two of smaller (making four or five), exclusive of those forming the extreme edge. Infraorbital series formed of five or six plates, of which the horizontal one is twice as large as that anterior to it.
Seales on the body very large, spinous and crestless. Those on the back are twice as wide as those on the belly; rather broader than long; subcircular or subhexagonal and very thin. These are smooth: on the under surface, except beneath the feet, but decidedly carinated on the sides and above, most especially on the tail. Those along the middle of the back (ten or twelve) rows are either very obsoletely carinated (as in Cat. Nos. 2952, 2933) or not at all. All-the scales on the upper surface of the back and tail are denticulated; a larger tooth or spine in the center, and usually two or three on each side. On the back the central spine is but little longer than the lateral, owing to the truncation of the scale; on the tail, however, it is much longer, the scale very acute. There are about fourteen quite distinct femoral pores.
There are about forty-eight rows of scales encircling the body at the thickest part. Of these about seventeen are on the back, as nearly as ean be estimated. At a distance from the anus equal to that from the nose to the hinder edge of occipital plate the tailis encircled by thirteen rows of scales.
In alcohol the color of this species is yellowish, with about seven transverse, broad, dusky bands above from head to opposite anus and as many thence to tip of tail. There are also traces of two or three on top of head; of these the one which extends between the shoulders is very distinct, crescentic in shape, and continuously black. The others are only faintly indicated by dusky sides to the scales. In the male the chin or space beneath the head is blue, and there is an elongated blue patch on each flank, margined internally and behind by black, more extended in the groin. The two patches are separated on the belly by about ten scales; they are very indistinct anteriorly. The remaining under parts are plain yellow. A supposed female (Cat. No. 2952b) has a trace of blue on chin, but none on the flanks. ~ In a specimen (Cat. No. 2955) the black collar on the neck above is extended across the throat. The dark dorsal bands are confined to the

<<<Page: 377>>>

central region for a width of some six scales, where the scales are more continuously colored than in Cat. No. 2952. Some of these scales have a tinge of green. The black cervical collar above is margined before and behind by a lighter shade of the ground color; as in Cat. No. 2952, there is one dusky band on the nape. The scales on the supraorbital region are more broken up and tubercular; the occipital plate narrower. The blue or green of the sides has no black margin anteriorly or externally. It extends nearly to the axille.
In some specimens the chin is spotted with blackish. In many the scales on the chin and sides are yellowish, but when removed the subjacent skin is seen to be bluish.
In Cat. No. 2960 the ground color on the back is greenish, with an occasional yellowish scale; the blotches and cervical crescent, as described. The chin is greenish, with a longitudinal line of yellowish; the lateral region spotted with the same. There are obsolete bands of lighter on the back between the dusky portions.
This species is very similar to S. torquatus Wiegmann in general appearance and character, but differsin several appreciable points. The plates on top of head are much more irregular. Then there is no symmetrical lateral occipital, although there is a plate larger than the others adjacent to it. The second series of three plates is entirely broken up into irregular small ones; the more anterior ones are pretty much the same in both. The supraorbital plates are much more irregular and tubercular, the central ones smaller. There is no tangible difference in the infraorbital series. The plates on the temporal region, between the eye and ear, and those on the under surface of feet are considerably larger. The fingers and toes are shorter. The scales on the middle of the back are flatter, more membranaceous, more truncate behind, and much less connected—in fact, usually smooth.
The color differs in being yellowish above instead of green; the dorsal blotches and the large blue patch on the flank, are more distinct. The black collar is more crescentic or rounder behind than V-shaped, and lacks the distinct process separating the yellowish anterior margin. The light markings anterior to the collar and its margin are in the form of transverse bands, not spots.
The largest of its genus found in Texas, this species has nearly the
range of the S. spinosus. I found it very abundant in the first plateau —
region as far as the upper waters of the Guadalupe. It differs in its habits from the S. spinosus, being exclusively a dweller in rocks. It may be seen at any time running over the limestone cliffs of the plateau region, to which its light colors present but little contrast. The relation between its color and habitat is quite as striking as in the S. spinosus.

Dorsal and lateral scales large, subequal; ventral scales a little smaller. Femoral pores, 13-15. Head scales smooth; frontal not longitudinally divided; two parietals on each side.
Seales rounded, not keeled, the border serrate with a moderately prominent, flat median point. Caudal scales with longer and recurved points. Scales of inferior surfaces notched; those of the limbs above keeled and mucronate, below little notched or entire. Dorsal scales in parallel rows; of sides oblique upward and backward. Two scales on the canthus rostralis. One row of transverse scales above the orbit, which are separated from the frontals forward by one row of small scales, but are in contact with the frontoparietals and parietals. T'wo parietals; the anterior rhomboidal, the posterior transverse.

Seven dorsal scales in a head length, and twelve ventrals. Kighteen scales between groin and humerus, and nine scales from above middle of humerus to interparietal plate. Jour superior labial plates, the last very narrow, and separated from the orbit by two rows of scales and a narrow suborbital plate. A series of long, mucronate, chaffy scales in front of the auricular meatus, which is followed by large chafty scales, of which the posterior row overhangs a pocket which is lined with granular scales. Limbs and digits rather short and robust, the longest toe of the oppressed hind limb reaching the front of the auricular meatus.

The coloration of this species is peculiar and striking. The ground on the middle dorsal region is brown, and on the sides blackish. In smaller specimens there are transverse rows of whitish scales which

<<<Page: 381>>>

give a cross-banded result; the tail is blackish, and the inferior surfaces are light bluish. In adults the colors are more brilliant. The median dorsal scales have a blue spot at the base and a reddish spot at each margin. On the laterals three or four spots are present, but they may be blue, green, or reddish, giving on some scales an ocellated effect, the whole being quite kaleidoscopic. The head, limbs, and tail are dark blue, as are all the inferior surfaces excepting an obscure paler space connecting the axilla.
This species is nearly related to the S. clarkiit Baird and Girard, but differs in the presence of two parietal plates on each side, in the absence of keelson thescales, and in the coloration. The posterior parietal plates articulate with the interparietal, and are not entirely posterior, as represented in Dr. Stejneger’s otherwise excellent figures. The character of the coloration is very handsome in adults and is unique in,the genus.
In its geographical range the S. orcuttii is restricted to southwest California in the mountainous region near the coast. It is named for Mr. ©. R. Orcutt. a well-known naturalist of San Diego.

into blue on sides and throat. Chin light green. Brachium black in front. In younger specimens the prebrachial spot often does not connect with the lateral abdominal band.
A large species to be compared with the 8. clarkii, which is found in Texas and Arizona. The latter has a shorter prefrontal plate, greater size, and different coloration.
In two specimens received since the above description was written (Cat. No. 11971) the entire inferior surfaces, excepting the chin, gular region, tail, tibiw, and feet, are bluish black.

Cephalic plates very large and regular; only one series of five large, transverse, supraorbital plates, bordered internally and externally by very small ones, the internal border wanting behind. Lateral occipitals nearly as large as middle cephalic plates; otherwise much as in

<<<Page: 384>>>

S. torquatus, except that there are two single verticals. Iree portion of longest toe nearly equal to the cephalic plates, reaching from muzzle to middle of occipital. Seales on back strongly carinated and acutely pointed, with a conspicuous, but not entirely free, spine. ‘Two or three distinet lateral denticulations. Belly scales notched. No conspicuous difference in size between scales of back, rump, and tail above; the first, however, larger than those on sides. Scales smooth on the inside of tibia. About thirty-two oblique rows of scales from head to tail, twenty-two from cervical fold. Femoral pores, fourteen or fifteen.
Color, yellowish green, with a distinct, cervical, black collar, broadly interrupted above and continued below across the throat; not margined. Back with dull, obscure, transverse bars and a series of dusky spots beneath a rather lighter lateral line.
In this species the head is scarcely wider than the neck. The wide space between the true marginal series of plates is occupied by one Series of five, broad, short plates. Of these, the two posterior are in immediate contact with the occipitals; the others cut off from the median ones. The other plates which occupy the remaining portion of the head are arranged as follows: Beginning with the posterior, or oecipitals, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and perhaps 2, 2 smaller ones, to the nostrils, although this space is sometimes much broken up. The occipitals are large; the two of the second row are separated by the contact of the middle one of first row and the third; the two of the fifth row likewise separated by the contact of fourth and middle fifth. The infraorbital chain is composed chiefly of one large horizontal plate. The temporal seales are large, about six series intervening between the orbital chain and the ear.
All the upper and lateral scales, as well as those on the under surface of the feet, are strongly carinated; the carina extended into a conSpicuous spinous point. Those on both upper and under surface herein, besides ending in a point, have the posterior edge denticulated on each side of this, seen even on the chin.
The general color of this species in the alcoholic specimen is a yellowish olive above, with a series of transverse but obsolete dusky bars, of which there are perhaps ten from the cervical collar to above the anus and continued to the tip of tail. These appear to be separated by ratber lighter intervals and themselves to be almost broken up into about four blotches. There is aslight indication of a V-shaped blackish-green collar on the side of the neck, just against the shoulder; but this is interrupted on the back, the branches running out to a point. Below, it is continued across the throat as a dusky green band, and the sides of the chin being of the same color, they bound a triangular blue spot beneath the head. There is also a blue patch on each side the belly, extending from fore to hind legs and scarcely separated on the median line. It appears to be rather darker internally and behind.
A specimen (Cat. No. 2964) in better condition than the type (Cat. No.

<<<Page: 385>>>

2940a) differs mainly in having the cephalic plates of the first and third series and the fourth and sixth separated by second and fifth. The upper parts show the four series of blotches above, about seven from the collar to above anus. They are arranged in two series of rounded blackish spots close together along the back, occupying a breadth of some six scales; then an interval of two or three rows lighter than the ground color; then a lateral series of rounded blotches, or two or three rows. They are all quite obsolete, however. The black, interrupted half collar on the hinder part of the neck is indicated above by an obsolete, dusky band. The center only of the chin is blue, the space covered by blackish green in Cat. No. 2940a being here only greenish white. The ventral blue patches are only indicated behind, very slightly internally. The groin is much marked with blackish.
A specimen of this species sent me from San Bernardino, California, by wmy friend, Mr. J. 8S. Lippincott, has six brown cross-bands on the body, and a vertical prelumeral brown band which nearly meets the corresponding one on the other side. These bands are broadly yellowbordered posteriorly, and are continued with the yellow borders as oblique bars on the sides to the belly. The individual is a female.
This species is readily distinguished from S. torquatus and poinsettii by the large plates in the supraocular region and other peculiarities about the head. The dark dorsal bars, instead of being continuous, are broken up into four blotches. The cervical collar is greatly interrupted above. The blue patch on the belly is much closer, the blue of chin is more restricted, and usually encircled by dusky greenish.
Dr. Stejneger regards! the S. magister of Hallowell as a species distinct from the S. clarkii. The only characters which he gives are the longer preauricular scales of the former and the presence of dusky cross-markings on the forearm and hand. He gives figures of the heads of the two supposed species, but the differences there shown do not, in my opinion, warrant the recognition of the S. magister as distinet. According to Jouy, who observed the species in life, the two forms are distinguishable by their colors, and they have different habitats, the one being found only on high ground, and being shy and agile, and the other living on low ground and climbing trees, and being sluggish and fearless. Stejneger believes these forms to have different distributions; thus, the S. magister inhabits the deserts of southern California, Nevada, and southwestern Utah, while the 8. clarkii inhabits southeastern Arizona and an unknown distance into Mexico. They occur together near Tuscon, Arizona. These forms do not seem to me to be worthy of distinction as subspecies.

Dr. Merriam, in his report upon the results of the Death Valley expedition, gives the habits of this species as follows:
The large scaly lizard known as Sceloporus clarkit (magister) is a lower Sonoran species, ranging across the southern deserts and desert ranges of the Great Basin from California to Arizona and southwestern Utah. Unlike most of the lizards inhabiting the same region, it does not run about on the open desert, but lives on the tree yuccas, the ruins of stone, or adobe dwellings, the nests of wood rats, and other objects that afford it shelter and protection. At the mouth of Beaverdam Creek, in northwestern Arizona, it was common among cottonwood logs and dead leaves. In Pahranagat Valley it was abundant about the ruins of stone houses and along the faces of cliffs, In the Mohave Desert and other localities it is common on the tree yuccas, where it was often found on the very summits of the highest branches, and where it was rather wary and difficult of capture without a gun.
In California it occurs throughout the Mohave Desert, ranging as far west as the tree yuceas in Antelope Valley and Walker Pass, and thence easterly in Owens Valley, Borax Flat, and the Argus and Panamint mountains.
In Nevada it was found on the Grapevine Mountains, in Ash Meadows, in PahTump Valley, at the foot of the Charleston Mountains, in Vegas and Indian Springs

<<<Page: 388>>>

valleys, in Pahranagat Mountains and Valley, at the Great Bend in the Colorado River, and in the vailey of the Virgin.
In Arizona it was abundant at the point where Beaverdam Creek joins the Virgin.
In Utah it was common in the lower Santa Clara or St. George Valley.
Sceloporus clarkii (magister) is a mixed feeder, both insects and flowers being found in the stomach examined. At the Great Bend of the Colorado, Nevada, and at St. George, Utah, stomachs were opened that contained insects only. One from the latter locality contained a large goldsmith beetle.
Mr. J. Van Denburgh describes some Scelopori from Lower California as a distinct species under the name of S. lickiit. The figures he gives represent a smaller form than the true S. clarkii, and one that is differently colored. Study of both the plates and description however fails to reveal any other character by which it differs from that species. I therefore for the present regard it as a tocal race. [append Mr. Van Denburgl’s description:
The head is considerably depressed, with rounded snout. There are two scales on the canthus rostralis. The nostrils are large, almost superior, and nearer to the end of the snout than to the orbit. The ear opening is very large, almost vertical, and with a strong anterior denticulation of six pointed scales, The head shields are smooth and somewhat convex. Thesupraoculars are very broad, ‘The superciliaries are very long, narrow, and strongly imbricate. There are two series of small, and one of large, sublabial plates, bordered below by the large,imbricate, bicuspid gulars. There is a strong fold on each side of the neck. The dorsal scales are slightly smaller than the caudals, strongly keeled, very strongly mucronate, and with serrate edges. The lateral scales are similar to, but smaller than the dorsals, arranged in oblique series, and graduating into the dorsals and ventrals. The ventrals are much smaller than the dorsals, smooth, and bior tri-cuspid. The caudals are very strongly keeled and mucronate. The posterior surface of the thigh is covered with large, pointed, keeled scales. There are fifteen femoral pores. Male, with enlarged postanal plates. There are thirty-three dorsal scales between the interparietal plate and the base of the tail.
The back and sides are olive brown, many of the scales having central markings of deep blue or green. <A narrow line of verdigris green runs along each side from the eye to the base of the tail. Below this, a narrower similarly colored line runs from the ear to a point a short distance above and behind the axilla, A pateh in front of the shoulder, the central part of the belly, and the anterior and lower surfaces of the thigh are black, which color gradually fades into the cyanine blue of the sides of the belly. The throat is olive gray with greenish-white lines which converge to a point midway between the neck pouches. The tail is brown suffused with campanula blue and beryl green toward its base.
Snout to vent, 74 mm.; fore limb, 37 mm.; tail, 105 mm.; shielded part of head, 15 mm.; hind limb, 54mm.; base of fifth to end of fourth toe, 22 mm.
There is very little variation in color, either individual, sexual, or in accordance with age. One male from Miraflores has a single large blue patch on the throat, through which the ordinarily whitish lines show as lines of paler blue.
This species may be easily distinguished from S. consobrinus by its larger scales on the back of the thigh; from S. biseriatus by its larger scales on the border of the ear and the back of the thigh; from S. orcuttii by its smaller and much rougher dorsals; and from S. magister and S. zosteromus by its smaller and more sharply mucronate scales. It differs from all these in coloration.
Mr. Van Denburgh gives the following list of localities from which he obtained specimens of S. lickii: San José del Cabo, Lower California; Corral de Piedras, Sierra el Taste, Lower California; Miraflores, Lower California; Sierra San Lazaro, Lower California.

One series of four or five, sometimes six, large transverse supraorbitals, with occasionally two or three smaller external ones, bordered internally and externally by a row of small ones, the former completely continuous, occasionally a few smaller plates. Cephalic plates large, with two single verticals, scales on back very large, and bristling, acutely pointed; Strougly carinated, with a prominent spine, but the two or three lateral

denticulations indistinct. No conspicuous difference in width o¥ scales on back, rump, and tail, the first mentioned much larger, their lateral scales about thirty-three oblique rows from head to tail, ten for cervical fold. Scales on inside of tibia and behind arms obsoletely carinated. Free portion of hind toe as long as, or even longer, than cephalic plates. Femoral pores about thirteen.
Color above greenish-yellow, with a series of dark transverse dorsal bands, not interrupted centrally on five rows of scales, a faint light lateral stripe beneath which are a few dusky blotches. Male with very little blue on the chin and sides of belly and a longitudinal blackish patch in point of shoulder.
The body of this species is stout, tapering from the middle to the head, which is scarcely as broad as, or not broader than, the neck. Inner orbital plates completely cutting off the large, supraorbital plates from those along the middle line of the head; sometimes there is an irregular indication of a smaller external series in a few plates. The cephalic plates are arranged as follows, beginning with the occipital: 3, 2,1, 1, 2, 3, With perhaps three more to the plates surrounding the nostrils, these exclusive of the plates along the lateral ridge of the head. The lateral occipital plates are nearly as large as the median, which is nearly or quite in contact with that of the third series, separating the two of the second row. The plates of the sixth series are large and nearly equal. In one specimen (Cat. No. 2961)) there is a third or median small plate in the second and fifth series.
Seales not quite so erect on the tail as in some other species. Dorsal scales acute, broader than long. Those below are angular, but denticulated and smooth. The number of rows can not be readily made out, but there appear to be about forty around the body in the thickest part. There are, however, but five rows on the middle of back, in a space the breadth of the head.
The ground color of this species is a dull, light, olivaceous green (sometimes yellow). On the middle of the dorsal surface is a series of transverse bars, eight or nine in number, from head to above arms, and continued on the tail. These are sometimes sharply defined and black, sometimes obsolete, and occupy five rows of scales, covering only the inner half of the outer of these. On each side of these blotches is a clear, light stripe about one row and two half rows wide, best defined above the fore legs, where the light stripe is succeeded by a dusky longitudinal one, which in the males is sometimes strongly defined. Posterior to this the dorsal blotches are continued obsoletely and narrowly across on the sides. There is a black patch across the insertion of the fore leg inthemale. The legs are barred transversely with yellowish and dusky, and in addition have various longitudinal lines of dusky on the outer surface, especially on humerus and tibia. The scales beneath, too, often show short (sometimes lengthened) longitudinal, well-defined blackish lines, the ground color being greenish-yellow or yellowish,

<<<Page: 391>>>

each scale often with a central line of lighter. There appears to be no blue on the chin, and that on the flanks is very faintly defined. There is not the slightest trace of a cervical collar, although sometimes a black patch on the shoulder.
Sometimes the dorsal bands are quite close together, with but little lighter interval. In Cat. No. 2935 the sides, between the fore and hind legs, are blue, changing to blackish internally, where there is a light interval of about six rows of scales. The color does not reach the groin.
This species has somewhat the appearance of Sceloporus clarkii, but

is readily distinguishable. The large supraorbitals are bounded completely internally by a row of small plates, cutting them off from contact with the first two series, as in clarkii. The scales on the backare very much larger, and are disproportionately larger than those below. The coloration is entirely different. There is no blotch or interrupted collar on the side of the neck nor blue on the chin; the bands of the back are more transverse and continuous over five rows of scales, instead of being each in ten blotches. In high-plumaged males there is a black longitudinal patch extending from the insertion of the arm to the bare space under the lateral fold, scarcely united to the blackish band

<<<Page: 392>>>

immediately above the arm. This sometimes has a few blue scales anterior to it, but there are none on the chin. The S. spinosus grows to twice the bulk of the S. undulatus, which is its nearest ally in the genus.
Dr. Stejneger! thinks that the form above described is not the true S. spinosus Wiegmann, which, he says, has fewer femoral pores and is an inhabitant of Mexico. I have not been able to detect any such difference in the specimens at my disposal.
Sceloporus spinosus Wiegmann is abundant in southwestern and western Texas, as far north as the heads of the Medina and Guadalupe. I did not see it on the Llano. There are specimens in Mr. Boll’s Dallas collections, but this gentleman informs me that it is very rare so far east. It ranges in north Texas chiefly west of Fort Worth. This lizard is especially arboreal, always ascending the trunks of trees when pursued. In this situation its somber colors afford it concealment. These are of different shades of brown without the brilliant blue and other colors of the two species of the genus already named. The range of this species extends as far east as Pensacola, Florida, whence Baird obtained the type of his S. floridanus.

SCELOPORUS UNDULATUS UNDULATUS Latreille.
Sceloporus undulatus undulatus Copr, Check List Batr. Rept. N. Amer., 1875, p. 48. Sceloporus undulatus Barrp, U. 8. Pacific R. R. Reports, X; Whipple’s Report, Reptiles, p. 37.
This species is of rather small size, plates on the anterior portion of head above, with a tendency to being rugose cavinate, the more posterior with a slight trace of the same. Smaller supraocular scales sqamiform or imbricate and carinate. The neck is constricted and narrower than the head. The plates of the head exhibit a considerable amount of variation, so that it is difficult to say what is the true formula of arrangement. There is, however, always a complete line of small seales along the inner edge of the supraorbital space separating the larger plates from those along the central line of the head. The most common plan, beginning with the parietals, is 3, 2,1,1,2, 3. The middle parietal is ecnsiderably larger than the lateral, and is generally separated from the third single plate by the two of the second series. Sometimes each of the latter is divided into two, one before the other, the anterior pair in contact, the posterior separated by the middle occipital. The fifth series of the plates has frequently (perhaps almost always) a third median, much smaller one. The sixth series sometimes has five plates transversely, exclusive of those on the lateral edge of the head. Anterior to the sixth series is another of three, five, or more small plates, separating it from those around the nostrils.
It is difficult to determine the number of scales encircling the body, owing to the obliquity of the rows on the sides, those on the back and belly being longitudinal. There are, as nearly as can be ascertained, about forty-four series, and about forty along the back from occiput to above anus. The scales on the back are all acute, and strongly carinated and spinous behind, with one or two rather obsolete denticulations oneach side. As usual, the belly scales, though denticulate, are smooth. There are about seven scales from the orbit tothe ear. There are about thirteen well-defined femoral pores. The feet appear to be lengthened; the free part of longest hind toe equal to the head to end of occipitals.
This species is of a brownish olive or gray above. There is a central dorsal, portion covering about ten dorsal rows, margined by a line of — still lighter. On each side of the back, from head to anus, are eight or q ten narrow, rather undulating V-shaped dark angular bands, the angle anterior and situated in the edge of this light dorsal portion. The inner legs of these angles sometimes nearly meet on the back, forming — undulating Vs with the angle behind. The space on the back, imme3 diately behind the dark bands, is generally lighter than the ground color, especially in the light lateral stripe. In the female the outer legs of the lateral V-marks are pretty distinctly visible. In the male they are generally (not always) obliterated by a nearly continuous dusky band, which extends from the black in front of the shoulder to the groin; the axilla, however, uncolored, as also a narrow lateral line from

it to the insertion of the hind leg. The male also has the entire under surface of the head black, with a large blue patch behind. The throat and sides of neck, from the lateral fold to and along the anterior face of the arm, are black. There is a large blue patch on each side of the belly from (but not in) the axille to the groin. This is black internally, where the shape is elliptical, the two of opposite sides separated when nearest by about two scaies. In the groin the color is chiefly black, and this sometimes covers the whole anterior surface of the thigh and the preanal region. The black along the belly is sometimes confluent with that anterior to the arm, but there is usually an interruption connecting the grayish of the thoracic region with that of the inner surface of the arm, and producing a distinet cross. The scales on the under surface, where not colored as described, are white, finely punctate with black, producing a grayish appearance. This mottling is sometimes aggregated into distinct short lines, most conspicuous in the female. The head has some transverse dark lines above.
In the female the sides sometimes appear spotted with whitish, fromthe tips, single scales being of this color. There is occasionally a trace of blue on the chin and sides,and generally of black at the insertion of the arm.
The shade of coloration varies considerably, being sometimes so dark as entirely to obscure the markings. The tip of the chin in the male is sometimes greenish white when not very highly colored; in fact, this is most generally the case.
Many specimens exhibit a series of dusky lines about theehead, among them two or three crossing the upper part, the median one opposite the center of the eyes. There are also usually two lines backward from the posterior canthus, one directed toward the occiput, the other crossing the upper end of the ear and confluent with the dusky of the sides.
Professor Baird distinguished the Pacific slope representatives of this species as a species under the name of SN. occidentalis Baird. He states the difference from Eastern specimens to be as follows:
The first positive difference is seen in the greater roughness of the dorsal and lateral scales, owing to the greater prominence of the keels of each scale. Each scale is more elongated and pointed owing to the greater prominence and backward extension of the mucro, and the edges on each side the spine have two distinct serrations instead of scarcely any. On the other hand, however, the belly scales are many entirely without notch, and this where present is always very slight or obsolete, while in wndulatus one or more are seen distinct and angular in every scale; a difference which appears to be constant consists in the entire smoothness of the scales on the inner or under surface of the tibial joint, and those on the under surface of the tail for a distance behind the anus nearly equal to the length of the head. The posterior edge of these scales is angular or truncate, without any mucro, and with or without a median notch. In S. undulatus the scales on the under side of the tibia are all distinctly carinated, mucronated, and with lateral notches, those behind the anus being similarly constituted except one or two first rows. The plates under the chin are decidedly smaller and more numerous. Those on the back appear smaller likewise.
The colors are so very similar that with the materials before me I can scarcely indicate any constant difference. The colors appear rather darker, and the legs of

<<<Page: 397>>>

the y-shaped marks are more thickened except at the extreme angle, so as to have somewhat the appearance of being broken up into two series of blotches on each side the upper leg of the y separated from the lower by the light line and thickened so as to appear somewhat triangular.
I do not find the characters above mentioned to be sufficiently constant to warrant the recognition of these Pacific forms as either species or subspecies, although I formerly! recognized them as Sceloporus
M4 f Wu x) NAL
SCELOPORUS UNDULATUS UNDULATUS LATREILLE. ats California. Cat. No. 8662, U.S.N.M.
undulatus thayerii, a name which is properly applicable to a Texan form.
Professor Baird also distinguished a long-legged race from southern California under the specific name of S. longipes Baird. I do not find this character constant enough to warrant such recognition. Professor Baird describes it as follows:
Hind foot and fore leg from elbow contained about two ard a half times in the total length of head and body, the entire hind leg longer than the body alone, and
1 Check List North American Batrachia and Reptilia, p. 49.

<<<Page: 398>>>

extended forward, reaching almost or quite to the eye. Free portion of longest toe longer than the cephalic plates. Tail one and a half times the head and body. Femoral pores very distinct and large. Scales on inside of femur and on belly smooth. General characters of form and coloration as in S. undulatus.
The general characters of this form are much as ascribed in SN. occidentalis, the most striking difference consisting in the much longer limbs, appreciable on the slightest comparison. It attains a considerably larger size, and the coloration is more vivid beneath, the blue of chin and sides more extended. The femoral pores are much more conspicuous. Its range is different, being confined to southern California or to the mountainous interior, while the other belongs to the northern coast region and to Oregon and Washington.
A form from Arizona is described by Stejneger, under the name SN, elongatus, as having very elongate hind legs and tail. The hind leg measures 52 mm., while the body measures 60mm. The leg is therefore not so long as in the longipes form. It does not differ otherwise from the S. undulatus.
The Sceloporus undulatus, or * Fence lizard,” as it is commonly called, is abundant in dry and wild regions in the Alleghenian and Carolinian districts of the Hastern region, It is usually seen running on fences, logs, or trunks of trees with great activity, alternating with periods of watching of the intruder on his haunts. It is very expert in dodging round the bodies on which it rests, defying for a long time attempts to capture it.
Prof. O. P. Hay' writes as follows about the habits of this species:
These little animals are extremely active, and they are able to run with great swiftness. Holbrook says that they are often found under the bark of decaying trees. It chooses also old fences as its basking places. It is given to climbing trees in search of insects and for safety from pursuers. De Kay states that when irritated in confinement they elevate their spinous scales in such a manner as to present a very formidable appearance. ‘They are perfectly harmless, although they are often regarded as venomous. De Kay further states that they are able to alter their colors, the back assuming an azure tint.
The eggs are said to be laid in the sand, probably in little groups. They are deposited about June 1, and are hatched about July 10. The eggs are long and narrow, are covered with a tough coat, and are without any calcareous material. The eggs weighs about 20 grains. They are abandoned to their fate, but when the young are hatched they are treated with the utmost gentleness by all the adults.

SCELOPORUS UNDULATUS TRISTICHUS Cope.
Sceloporus tristichus Copr, Report U. 8. Expl. Surv. W. 100th Mer., Zoology, V, 1875, p. 571.
Scales of the head smooth; supraorbitals in only three rows; a median series of transverse plates bounded by a row of small ones internally and externally; frontal divided transversely; interparietal wide as long; parietals undivided; scales in forty rows from head to base of tail, well keeled and strongly mucronate, a little larger than its lateral, which about equal the ventral; four preauricular free scales; a granular patch behind lateral fold of neck; when the short hind legs are extended forward, the end of the external toe reaches the axilla and the’ longest toe reaches the prehumeral pocket; femoral pores, sixteen.

round blackish-blue spot on each side the throat. This subspecies is about the size of the S. u. consobrinus, but it rather resembles in color the S. wu. undulatus. It has only one occipital plate on each side, and the arrangement of the supraocular plates is unlike that of any other species. Posteriorly the large transverse supraoculars are only separated from the superciliaries by a single series of lanceolate scales like the superciliaries. For their anterior half they are separated from this lanceolate series by two or three wider scales, forming a single row. There are two to three rows of rounded scales in the same position in the S. uw, undulatus and S. u. consobrinus. In the former subspecies from both coasts there are two rows of scales between the suborbital plate and the superior labials. In the SN. wu. tristichus there is only one such row, which consists of lanceolate scales. Thus this form differs from the S. undulatus in a direction the opposite of the S. biseriatus.
As to colorations, there are eight cross bands between the groin and axilla, while in the S. vu. undulatus from both coasts there are five or six.
Measurements.—Total length, 132 mm.; length to vent, 59 mm.; length to axilla (axial), 27 mm.; length to ear (azial), 14 mm.; length of fore leg, 24 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 37 mm.; length of hind foot, 18 mm.
This form differs considerably in appearance from the S. undulatus, but as it is represented by but one specimen it may turn out to Lea variety of that widely distributed species.

Supraorbital region with one cresentic series of six large transverse plates, embracing a much smaller one (of four or five) in its concavity, the whole bordered by a complete row internally and externally. Two central single plates, with a third more anterior, surrounded by five others, the plates all smooth. Occipital large, with two or three plates on each side, free portion of longest hind toe reaching to middle of occipital plate. Scales of back, rump, and sides of body not conspicuously different in size, those of tail alone larger. Dorsal scales angular, strongly carinated, mucronate with free spines and with lateral

denticulations, the belly scales decidedly notched. Scales in inside of femur and behind anus smooth. There are about forty-one oblique series from head to above anus; about thirty from the lateral cervical folds.
General color above, yellowish olive, with two well-defined narrow lines separated by about eight scales, and a broad median dorsal stripe of the ground color. Between each lateral and the dorsal stripe is a series of well-marked oblique short lines about two scales wide. A

dusky lateral stripe, with a yellowish one below it; a short horizontal line on the shoulder; beneath yellowish; tail without bands; sometimes a row of dusky blotches above. Male with two confluent bluish spots on each side the chin. Side of belly bluish; cephalic plates somewhat as in SN. thayeri. :
The prevailing color of this species is an olivaceous yellow, seldom greenish. On each side are two unusually well-defined stripes of clear yellow, the upper especially, which begins a little above the lateral

fold and runs back to the tail, which appears entirely without adjacent bars. It occupies a width of two half scales, the innermost of opposite sides separated on the back by a width of six scales (sometimes seven ?), the outermost separated by about three rows from the lower lateral stripe, which is bordered below by dusky, the under parts being yellowish. Between the lateral light lines is a dusky stripe, quite dark in adult males, though spotted with yellowish and really commencing behind the eye as a narrow line. Along the central line of the back is a broad stripe of the ground color, without blotches, and four rows of scales wide, and the interval between this space and the lateral stripes (one and two half scales) is crossed obliquely by a succession of about ten oblique dusky bars, from head to above anus. These bars are really the thickened inner legs of V-shaped marks, the outer legs in the dusky lateral stripe, but more or less obscured there, and sometimes quite indistinct on the back. Inthe male there is a dull patch of bluish on each side of the belly, but no black border. The dusky stripe below the lower lateral line, however, runs on to the anterior face of the thigh. The blue patches are separated on the belly by a wide interval. There is a blue patch, sometimes confluent and suffused with black, on each side of the chin. There is a short blackish line from the lateral fold to the shoulder, and several transverse ones across the top of head.
The general impression of color at a distance is that of a yellow-olive sheen, with two lateral yellowish stripes and three dusky ones (the upper a series of blotches), with a broad uncolored stripe down the middle of the back. There is no tendency to a meeting of the dorsal blotches, nor are there any bands on the tail.
This form appears to me to be rather a race of the S. undulatus than a distinct species. I at one time supposed it to be characterized by the presence of two parietal plates on each side, but I find, on examining larger material, that this character is entirely exceptional. In fact, there is no material difference in the plates of the head between this species and undulatus, except that they are smoother. The scales of the hind leg and undersurface of tail are, however, much smoother. The most appreciable difference is in color, the latter never having the sharply defined yellow lines on each side, nor the broad unblotched stripe on the back. The tail of consobrinus also is always without blotches, except occasionally on the median line. The blue marks on the belly and chin are less intense.
The smoothness of the scales ov the inside of the hind leg must be relied on in many cases to distinguish the species from 8S. thayeri (of much the same size) when the lateral markings are obscure. Even in this case, however, the light dorsal interval will generally be found well defined, and the tail without lateral, if any, blotches.
' Specimens from the Upper Colorado region, Cat. Nos. 4360-4362, differ in some respects from the type, with an approximation to S. undulatus.
This lizard is found all over Texas and is very variable in its charac

ters.
It always has about twenty-eight transverse series of keeled uni-
mucronate scales between the interscapula and interfemoral regions, and
the lateral scales are not larger than the ventral.
The head scales are
smooth. There may be three or two rows of supraorbitals between the internal and superciliary scales. The colors are often brilliant, especially — n specimens from near San Antonio, where the sides of the neck and head are often of a bright rufous and the tail reddish and yellowish-
brown at the base.
It is very abundant from Dallas west to Fort
Concho, and southwest to San Antonio, and in the first plateau region
to the head of the Medina River.
It is found on the ground, but
always takes refuge in trees, running on and around the limbs with great agility.
According to Stejneger' this species is common in the cedar belt of the San Francisco Mountain plateau in Arizona.

Supraorbitals in one series of five large transverse plates, margined internally by one series and externally by two of smaller hexagonal ones within the superciliaries. Cephalic plates large, regular, smooth. Free portion of longest hind toe equal to the length of cephalic plates above. No decided difference in breadth of scales on back, rump, or tail above; the first, however, decidedly larger than those on sides. Dorsal scales angular, but the edges rather rounded, with moderate carination, very slight spine, and almost no lateral denticulation; the belly scales scarcely or not at all notched. Seales on inside of tibia smooth, without mucro. Femoral pores 14-16. About fifty oblique series of dorsal scales; thirty-five firm gular fold. Femoral pores about twenty.
Above olivaceous gray (green to blue in life), with the dorsal series of rounded blotches, bordered behind with lighter gray. No cervical collar, but one or two small spots on shoulder. Chin and sides of male faintly blue.
Head large and broad. Plates 3 (occipital), 2,1, 1, 2,3, and 4 to the four internasals. Lateral parietals large. External two rows of supraoculars flat and smooth, hexagonal, and truncate posteriorly. Only one row external to the last one or two large supraoculars. Five acuminate free scales bounding auricular meatus in front.
The scales are small, there being but about fifty oblique series from

head above to tail, and about sixty-five around the body. They become smaller from the back to the sides, where they scarcely if at all exceed the belly scales. Abdominal and gular scales slightly notched at apex. The extended hind leg reaches to the orbit. ;
The ground color of this species above is a light olivaceous-gray with —
ten dorsal series of about ten round blotches, bordered behind by a lighter shade of the ground color. These blotches are three or four scales wide. There are faint indications of a lateral series of the same spots, but without any intervening light line. The hinder part of the thigh shows two blackish lines. There is a small blackish spot on the shoulder and another above it, but no indication of a collar. This

region and that of the groin show a few light yellowish spots. The sides of the belly and the under surface of the head are blue, the latter with the blue posterior, and anteriorly with a median light line and scattered spots. In old males the throat, middle of belly, and inferior side of femur may be black.
This species is quite well marked, and is not likely to be confounded with any others from the West, excepting, perhaps, S. wndulatus. In this it differs in the larger size and the smoother and smaller scales, as well as in the plates of head, and the hexagonal shape and smoothness of the smaller supraoculars. Its limbs are longer, greatly exceeding in this respect S. wndulatus.

<<<Page: 408>>>

This is the Great Basin species of the S. undulatus group, ranging as far southeast as San Bernardino, California. It is the handsomest of them, but displays great variety in the coloration, which, however, always displays green on the upper surfaces, and frequently blue. I have takenit in the San Francisco Mountains, southwestern Utah, and Summer Lake, Oregon, which is the most northern locality known to me. In the specimen from the latter locality there is a row of turquoise blue spots on each side of the back.
In regard to the distribution of this species, Dr. Merriam, in the report on the results of the Death Valley expedition, remarks as follows:
Sceloporus biseriatus is one of the few lizards inhabiting both the desert ranges of the Great Basin and the interior valley of California. Specimens were obtained at frequent intervals all the way from the Upper San Joaquin Valley, in California, to the Upper Santa Clara Valley, in Utah, about 10 miles northwest of St.George. On the east side of the Great Divide, in California, it was obtained on the Panamint, Argus, Coso, White, and Inyo mountains, and at the east foot of the Sierra, in Owens Valley (on Independence Creek). On the west side of the Great Divide it was common on the west slope of Walker Pass, and thence down into Kern Valley to the neighborhood of Kernville, and southerly along the west slope of the Sierra to Havilah and Walker Basin, and northerly to Three Rivers. It was common also in the Canada de las Uvas and in the Upper San Joaquin Valley, where specimens were collected on the Charleston Mountains (near Mountain Spring), on Mount Magruder, in the Juniper Mountains, and in the Grapevine Mountains.
A black form (having the belly intensely blue-black) was found on black lava rock in Diamond Valley, Utah; on the Charleston Mountains (near Mountain Spring), Nevada, where it was found both on rocks and on juniper trees, and on the White Mountains, near the eastern boundary of California. In the latter locality it was. common on the summit of the Divide, near the road between Deep Spring and Owens valleys, where it was frequently seen on and among light-colored rocks, which made it unusually conspicuous. It is entirely possible, however, that this very striking contrast is a protection, causing the lizard to resemble the dark cracks in the rocks when viewed fron’ above by passing hawks.

Cephalic plates much as in S. wedulatus. Frontal undivided. Tree portion of long hind toe reaching from mouth to middle of occipital plate. Dorsal, rump, and caudal scales about equal, the front rather larger than the lateral scales. Scales above angular-pointed, with conspicuous keel and spine, with decided lateral denticulations. Belly scales are quite decidedly carinated, those on inside of the tibia and behind anus still more so. There are about forty-two oblique series of scales on each side the back, about twenty-eight or thirty from the cer-

vical folds. Femoral pores about twelve or fifteen. Light lines on each side of the back, separated by six or seven scales only; between these two series of dark blotches. Male with a continuous, well-marked black stripe on the sides, from above the arm, and a blue patch on each side the belly; black internally and behind; a black patch on each side the posterior half of chin, sometimes (not always) confluent internally, each one with another always distinet one of blue.
This species has a close resemblance to S. undulatus, and sometimes is distinguished with great difficulty. The interparietal is larger, the parietals smaller, and two on each side instead of one. The scales are more strongly carinated. The light stripes on each side the back are near together, being separated by an interval of only six or eight scales instead of ten. The black lateral stripe is much more distinet. There is a greater interval between the blue patches on the belly. The blue

<<<Page: 411>>>

on the chin is in two patches instead:of one, as is more generally the case (though not always) in undulatus. The size appears considerably less. The dorsal markings are more in the shape of triangular blotches, as in the form S. occidentalis, than in undulating narrow lines.
The lack of distinet yellow lines and the presence of the lateral — black stripe, with the carination of inferior tibial and postanal scales, will distinguish it from S. vu. consobrinus. This form is, so far as known, restricted to southwestern Texas. It is peculiar in the genus in the carination and acumination of the ventral scales, and in the same character of the scales on the inferior surface of the tibia. The scales external to the large series of supraoculars are less numerous than the species of this section, approaching very nearly to the type of S. tristichus. ;

Supraorbital region with a large crescent of transverse plates (much broken anteriorly) with a second smaller in its convexity. Two more external rows and an internal, making five in all. Cephalic plates smooth. Two middle verticals. Occipitals with a row of small, smooth plates behind. Free portion of hind toe reaching to middle of occipital. Dorsal and lateral scales equal, acute, rather spinous; about fifty rows of scales from head to tail. Femoral pores about fifteen.
Olive gray with two light lines on each side; scales wide, not margined by black, separated by eight rows of scales. Two series of elongated blackish crescents on each side the back. A vertical black line from dusky lateral bar on neck to shoulder, with a whitish one behind it. A bluish spot above insertion of arms. Two black lines on posterior face of tibia. Chin in male marbled with blue; sides with a blue patch separated below by seven or eight rows of scales.
Lateral gular flap very small, almost wanting; only indicated by the

<<<Page: 412>>>

small size of scales in the subjacent cavity. Occipital plate very large, subtriangular or pentagonal, broader than long, with three lateral plates, all quitesmall. The series of cephalic plates is occipital, 1, 1, 2, 5, and two or three smaller series to the nostrils. All are perfectly smooth. The supraorbital region shows one internal series of small plates, then a series of six or seven moderately broad ones, then two rather confused smaller series within the angular plates at the extreme outer edge.
The seales on the body are all small, there being, as far as can be ascertained, about fifty encircling the body at the thickest part. Ina male about fifteen rows may be counted in the middle of the back in a space equal to the head in width; in a distended female only eleven. The scales on the tail are wider than those on the back. The scales

on the back are but little wider than those on the belly, certainly not one and a half times as wide. They are acute, conspicuously keeled, and mucronate behind, but with only slight indication of lateral notches, and that only close to the median point. The belly scales are very rarely notched, generally angular, but sometimes a little truncate. Those on the inside of the tibia and between the anal region are smooth. There are about fifteen femoral pores.
The ground color of this species is brownish; olivaceous above, with two conspicuous yellowish stripes on each side, the two inclosing a rather darker stripe, and the lower with a narrow interrupted dusky line below it. On each side are two series of U-shaped or crescentic dusky blotches, one between the light stripes, the other above the upper one. They are separated on the back by a plain grayish line, equal to the width of two (sometimes three) scales. They really begin

<<<Page: 413>>>

at the head as stripes, one behind the middle of the eye, the other in a line with the suborbital plates, but above the shoulder they break up into the crescentic blotches, of which there are nine or ten, to above anus. These blotches are formed by a U of black, the convexity behind, and the legs filled up by darker olive than elsewhere. They are bordered — behind by narrow yellowish crescents, running into the lateral stripes. There is around black spot immediately above the insertion of the arm on a line with the lowermost dark stripe, and a short perpendicular bar from the median dusky stripe on the neck to the shoulder; in the male running along the anterior face of the arm, but always separated from the black spot mentioned. There are two well-defined black lines on the posterior face of the thigh. The legs are barred with dusky, each bar bordered behind by yellowish. The under parts are yellowish white, the chin coarsely marbled or reticulated with bluish, sometimes greenish white. The tail is decidedly banded and blotched.
The male has an oblong blue patch on each side the belly, extending from (but not in) axilla to groin. The median light interspace is linear and about six scales wide. Theupper series of blotches is contained in a width of about two and two half scales; the upper light line is about one and two half scales.
In some larger specimens from the upper Missouri (Cat. No. 2888) the dark crescents are more obsolete, and the blue on the side of belly is much darker internally, almost black, but does not extend on the anterior face of the thigh. In one specimen only, which appears to be very old and highly colored (Cat. No. 2842), the whole under surface of the femur ‘is blackish, this color extending forward from the inner edge of the blue ventral blotches to the breast, separated there by a narrow light space from a blackish band across the throat. The space in front of the shoulder is black, with a white spot. The under surface of the head is blue, speckled with whitish, and faintly blotched with black.
The typical specimens of S. gracilis (Cat. No. 3063), from Oregon, I can not distinguish from those of S. graciosus except by the more obsolete nature of the markings. They appear rather more slender, but this may be owing to haying been preserved in too strong alcohol. A specimen from upper Pitt River (Cat. No. 2832) appears precisely like Cat. No. 2888 from upper Missouri; like them, having the blotches less distinct than in the type specimens. .
This species, though quite similar to S. scalaris of Wiegmann, is readily distinguished, with other features, by the smoothness of the cephalic plates, and by the definite direction of the scales of the sides of the body.
This is a pretty species, which is especially abundant in the Great Basin region. The most northern locality of its range with which Iam acquainted is Summer Lake, Oregon, where I caught specimens. Stej— neger records it from the Painted Desert, Arizona. I have observed a slight variety of it from near the city of Jalapa, Mexico, in the collection of the Comision Geographica et Exploiadora of Mexico,

<<<Page: 414>>>

The following account of the habits of Sceloporus graciosus is given by Dr. Merriam in his report upon the results of the Death Valley
expedition :
This species, which is a characteristic inhabitant of the Upper Sonoran and transition zones in northern Nevada, eastern Oregon, and Idaho, was very abundant on the sage-covered plateau of Mount Magruder at an altitude of 2,450 meters (8,000 feet) ; in the sage plains on top of the White and Inyo mountains near the boundary between California and Nevada; and on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada west of Owens
Valley (at 2,450 meters, or 8,000 feet).
It was common also among the sage and juni-
per on the Juniper Mountains, along the boundary between Nevada and Utah. Sceloporus graciosus is generally found in company with such Transition zone species as the sage thrasher (Oroscoptes montanus), Brewer's sparrow (Spizella brewerii), the Nevada sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli nevadensis), the sage-plains chipmunk (Tamias minimus pictus), the sage-brush pocket mouse ( Perognathus olivaceus) and the sage-plains spermophile (Spermophilus mollis).

This is a small species with small scales and very dark colors. There
is not much difference in the sizes of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral
scales. Forty-five rows may be counted between the occiput and a line connecting the groins, and twelve in a head length. Between the groin and axilla thirty-five scales may be counted to an axillary area of smaller and smooth seales. The dorsal and lateral scales are keeled and mucronate; those of the inferior surfaces smooth and mostly feebly notched. Caudal scales strongly keeled and mucronate, and larger than dorsals. Two parietals on each side, the anterior the larger, and extending to the narrow marginal supraocular row, so that there is only one fronto-

parietal on each side. A third parietal external to the other two. The frontal is not longitudinally divided. There is one series of six large supraoculars, separated from the frontals and fronto-parietals all round by a series of small scales. External to the large supraoculars is a series of four much smaller polygonal flat scales much asin SN. biseriatus. Between these and the superciliaries is one row of still smaller scales (with an extra scale or two). Two scales on the canthus rostralis. Head scales all smooth. Six large free auricular scales. A single vertical prehumeral fold, inclosing a pocket of granular scales. Temporal scales keeled.
The extended hind leg reaches to the auricular meatus. Femoral pores 16. Male with postanal plates.

A small species with an arched profile. Supracephalic plates keeled, arranged as in WS. sealaris, each canihus rostralis having two roofShaped scutes; supraocular scales subhexagonal, in three rows, those of the internal row scarcely wider than long. The two frontals creased with a furrow; the posterior, nearly as large as the anterior, is articulated behind, along the shorter side, with the occipital plate. The latter, as wide as it is long, narrow in front, is bordered right and left by one or two frontoparietals and one parietal scute; behind, its outline is subround, showing in the middle a hollow in which is inelosed a small nuchal scale, a little larger than those on the upper part of the neck. Labial seales rectangular, eight above and ten below; above the upper ones there are two longitudinal series of lengthened seales. Anterior border of the ear bordered with scutella smaller than those which precede them. Dorsal scales not notched, rhomboidal, strongly keeled, Sharply pointed, forming thirty-eight oblique series, from the nape of the neck to the posterior border of the thighs, eight longitudinal to the level of the shoulders, and twelve in the trunk region; eight of these Scales equal the length of the top of the head; ventral scales and those of the sides rather small, the latter feebly notched, forming by the junction of their keels longitudinal lines parallel to those on the upper surface of the body. ‘Tail scales smaller than those on the body, except

<<<Page: 417>>>

at the base, where they are of the same dimensions. Tibia not quite so long as the shielded part of the bead. The femoral pores, less distinet in the female, number seventeen to cighteen under each thigh, and almost merge together at the interfemoral region.
Measurements.—Total length of specimen, 104 mm.; length of upper sarface of head, 9 mm.; length of head at the level of the temples, 85 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 44 mm.; length of tail, 60 mm.; length of tibia, 9 mm.
Upper surfaces of the body olive green, mixed with a.coppery reddish brown; two indistinct bands extend along each side of the body; between each two there are traces of black dots. Lower surfaces bright yellow.
Says Bocourt: ‘‘Wiegmann’s type of this species is a female of small size, resembling Sceloporus scalaris in the following particulars: (1) arrangement of supracephalic plates; (2) scales on the sides have the carine directed backward, forming by contact longitudinal lines parallel to those of the dorsal scales; (3) femoral pores merge together in the interfemoral region. There are some details, however, of no great specific value, which distinguish Sceloporus aneus from its relatives; head and limbs relatively short; scales of the upper part of the body rather large, and the coloration differs markedly in some respects.”
According to Duges, the Sceloporus eneus is characteristic of the Texcocan district of the plateau. He records it from Guanajuato, Silos, Tupataro, Lamora, and Chilcota.

Cephalic plates generally smooth, arranged very nearly as they are S. variabilis Wiegmann. Prefrontal scales rounded; two roof-shaped scales on each acanthus rostralis; occipital plate bordered posteriorly by a row of thick scales a little larger than those on the anterior part of the neck; supraoculars arranged in three longitudinal rows, sometimes in four or five, making a region of hexagonal scales rather wider than long; anterior border of the auditory meatus having a serrated structure, formed by flat-pointed scutella, slightly larger than those immediately preceding; scales on the back small, rhomboidal and keeled, arranged in from sixty-six to seventy-nine oblique rows extending from the nape of the neck to a line joining the posterior borders of the thighs; eighteen to twenty-one of the scales equals the length of the upper surface of the head; ventral scales and those of the flanks a trifle smaller; the keels of these latter scales are directed obliquely upward; tail covered with scutella, strongly keeled, as large again as those on the back; fifteen to twenty-two pores under each thigh.
Upper parts of the body olive green, with a very narrow collar and bands of striped brown, giving a mottled appearance to the flanks. On the lateral part of the belly the males have two longitudinal black bands, very close together, bordered on the outside with blue. The collar region is sometimes crossed with black; throat a blue gray, thickly dotted with small, black spots.
Measurements.—Total length, 140 mm.; length of head from the end of muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital plate, 14 mm.; width of head at the temples, 15 mm.; length of trunk from chin to anus, 61 mm.; length of tail, 79 mm.; lenth of tibia, 15 mm.
Sceloporus microlepidotus, regarded by Wiegmann in Isis as a variety of S. grammicus, differs from it only in having the dorsal scales smaller; but as these are variable in size in both cases, it is very difficult to distinguish always the species.
The S. microlepidotus is abundant on the Mexican plateau, ranging north to Guanajuato, where it has been taken by Dr. Dugés.
Locality.—South of Chihuahua. Donor, John Potts.

Cephalic plates smooth. Supraorbitals in one large crescentic series, embracing a smaller one in its concavity; an internal and two external series in addition, the latter sometimes confused with the exterior central so as to have but two external to the large ones. Occipital very large, with large ones behind; one vertical. An anterior median pentagon surrounded by five plates. Dorsal and rump scales very sinall, smaller than caudal, but abruptly much larger than the entire lateral

series; dorsal scales without mucro or denticulation; belly scales entire; about eighty-two series of scales from head te tail. Free portion of hind foot shorter than cephalic plates, in male longer than in female. Femoral pores about eighteen or twenty.
Above greenish olive, irregularly varied with small dusky blotches, with indistinct border behind lighter than ground color. Two lateral stripes separated by about eighteen rows of scales. Side of neck and body dark indigo; an oblique whitish stripe on sides from groin; a perpendicular bar above the shoulder and several light blotches on and in front of shoulder, circumscribing a subcireular indigo patch with a central blotch. Sides of jaws with blue and whitish bars extending round on the chin obliquely backward. Female almost plain greenish blue; whitish beneath.
This species, among those with the smallest dorsal seales, is also one of small dimensions. The head is depressed, rather pointed, but rounded at the tip, and the distance from snout to end of occipitals is

<<<Page: 421>>>

12 the width above. The hind feet are lengthened, the free portion of longest toe being equal to or longer than the head above. The cephalic plates are all perfectly smooth, the anterior ones finely punctured round the circumference. The frontal is longitudinally divided. The inter-
parietal is large and subquadrate or pentagonal and pointed anteriorly. —
There are two or three parietals on each side and a pair in contact anterior to this, then 1, 2,3,3 with three others to the plates surrounding the nostrils with four supranasals. The plates on the snout are so disposed anterior to the single internasal as to form a pentagon of five around a smaller. There are six transverse supraocular plates, with one internal and two external series, the latter sometimes indistinct.
The scales on the body are all very small, at least eighty or more encircling the body. They are not very acute, distinctly keeled above and on sides, with moderate scarcely projecting mucro. No lateral denticulations can be observed; the belly scales, however, are faintly notched. The scales on the sides are much smaller than those on the back, especially on the side of neck and above shoulders, where they are almost paved and tubercular, not imbricate.
The upper parts in the male are greenish olive, mottled irregularly with small blackish blotches, in which no serial arrangement can be observed. On each side of the back is a light-greenish line, the two separated by about eighteen rows of scales, exhibiting as many lines of carination nearly parallel to each other. Below this there is no distinet oblique serial arrangement of carinated scales, except midway between fore and hind legs. The sides immediately below the light stripe are abruptly bluish black, bordered posteriorly below by a well-defined white stripe passing obliquely upward and forward from the groin half way to the axilla, and then broken tp the rest of the distance into a series of obsolete light mottlings and spots. Below this light space is an indigo patch on each side of the belly, quite obsolete and indistinet centrally and inferiorly, where there is an interval of eight or ten scales and no black inner margin, as in variabilis. The sides of the neck are deep indigo, with a distinct whitish band from the lateral stripe perpendicular to the insertion of the arm. Anterior to this is an angular light spot on the center of an indigo subcireular patch, bounded above and behind by the light lines mentioned, below by one or two yellowish spots. Anteriorly the sides of the neck are mottled with light spots and a yellowish horizontal line from the gape of the mouth. The sides of the jaws are crossed perpendicularly by five or six narrow light lines, which, on the chin, pass obliquely backward, so as, with their fellows, to form a series of indistinct and interrupted Vs, the intervals being blue. On the point of the chin, however, the whitish predominates. The posterior face of the thigh (covered with paved scales) is indigo, with a light stripe. The legs are banded transversely with dusky bluish.
This is the most highly varied of all the North American Scelopori,

<<<Page: 422>>>

and is very difficult to describe. It differs in coloration from its nearest ally, S. marmoratus, by the absence of serial arrangement of dorsal blotches; by the decided -shaped arrangement of the blue on the chin and the lines on the jaws; the white line on the flanks; the greater separation of the patches on the belly, and the absence of a dark inner border to them. The form differs very materially.
A young specimen (Cat. No. 273La) has a more decided serial arrangement of larger and more quadrate dorsal blotches, and there is an indication of a dark blue patch on the throat, with a transverse whitish band connecting the yellowish patch on the shoulder.
In the four female specimens before me (Cat. No. 2743) the general color is of a light bluish; greenish olive above, and whitish beneath. There is a faint trace of ten dorsal rows of small crescentic blotches, and of a lateral light line, with a dusky stripe along the sides, but this is very indefinite. There is no decided indication of the usual blotches or lines about the shoulder.
This species is readily distinguished from most of its allies with small scales by the smoothness or the cephalic plates and the marked inferiority in size of the lateral to the dorsal plates. Those on the side of the neck and body for some distance behind the shoulders are almost like fine tubercles, not imbricated nor carinated.
I have referred Cat. No. 2739, males and females, to this species, although there is an unusual difference in color for the sexes of the same species and the hind toes are shorter. In coloration this is one of the handsomest of the genus.

Supraorbitals in one large series with one internal and two external. One frontal plate; anterior to this, a central plate surrounded by five others. Occipital plates margined behind by smaller ones. Cephalic plates all strongly corrugated. Dorsal scales in seventy series, from head to tail; about forty-five from gular fold, smaller than caudal, larger than lateral; pointed with moderate mucro, but no lateral denticulations. Free part of hind toe as long as cephalic plates. Scales of sides of neck much smaller than on neck above. Temoral pores eleven.
Dark green above with two lateral light-greenish bands on each side, separated by about fourteen rows. Back with two series of subquadrate blotches separated by light lines confluent with the lateral. Sides dusky. <A short, light Jine from the lateral stripe running perpendicularly to the insertion of arm. A black ellipse on each side extending as far as in axilla to the light line just mentioned; the outline interrupted above; the two in contact on the middle of the belly.

<<<Page: 424>>>

The plates on the upper surface of the head are all conspicuously and strongly rugose or wrinkled longitudinally. The cephalic plates, however, do not appear to differ materially from those of 8. graciosus. The occipital is large and subtriangular, with three nearly equal plates on each side, the anterior pair in contact. Next comes one median plate, then two, then three, but with a small plate between the two series and surrounded by the five composing them. The six large supraorbitals are bordered internally by one row and externally by two of small plates.

The seales are all very minute, much larger on the body than tail, searcely largest above, those on the throat being scarcely distinguishable. There are at least seventy in a series around the middle of the body and about eighteen between the axillee beneath. Those above and on the sides are very distinctly keeled and angular, with a decided muecro and lateral notch. The belly and chin scales have all a decided central notch but no earination, and the scales on the inner face of the tibia and postanal space are perfectly smooth. The hind feet are very long, the free part of longest toe equaling the head from nose to end of large occipital plate behind and nearly to ear. There are eleven or twelve femoral pores.

<<<Page: 425>>>

« This species is of a dark olive-green color, with a light greenish-whiteline on each side, separated by fourteen or fifteen rows of seales, Between these are two series of subquadrate or dark blotches, separated _ by a faint dorsal greenish line, the blotches bordered behind by branches from the upper lateral stripe. Below the light lateral line is a blue-black stripe beginning narrowly back of the eye and widening on the sides, its lower edge not sharply defined. In the male there is a well-defined elongated black ellipse on each side the belly; those of opposite sides very nearly in contact and the upper part wanting or diffused in the — dusky of the sides. This anteriorly runs into a large, intensely black patch in and above the axilla and extending along the posterior face of | the arm; posteriorly it reaches the groin, but does not extend on the femur. The central portion of the ellipse is whitish, with a violet shade in the alcoholic specimen. ‘There is a well-defined narrow yellow line running perpendicularly from the lateral stripe to the insertion of the arm above. The under parts are whitish, irregularly dotted with blue-black, most so on the chin, which appears speckled with whitish. There is a trace of a short white line on the cheek m line with the gape of mouth.
In the series before me there are no females from the same localities — with the males. Those referred to the same species are what Dr. Hallo| well and Baird and Girard have called S. scalaris of Wagler. These — are similar in general character, but lack the ventral elliptical marks | and the distinct lateral black band. There is, however, the same short, light line at the shoulder, perpendicular to but not confluent with the — lateral light stripe.
It may be proper to state that the specimen on which the description has been based (Cat. No. 2889) has rather a blunter snout than the — others and the scales on the back appear rather smaller, but I can find no other characters of importance.
This species ranges throughout the damper parts of eastern and | southern Mexico, and in southwestern Texas as far north as the latitude of San Antonio. The locality “Salt Lake” of the Smithsonian record, as given below, is probably incorrect. Stejneger was the first — to discover that this species is the S. delicatissimus of Hallowell; and — both Hallowell and Baird and Girard had regarded other examples of it — as the S. scalaris. |
The 8S. variabilis is probably named on account of the wide difference in color between the males and females. It is one of the handsomest — species of the genus,

General plan of supraorbitals as in S. undulatus, the outer central series of supraorbital plates small. The cephalic plates anteriorly and laterally rugose. Two internasals and four postnasals. Two frontals. Legs very short; proportion of longest toe about three-fourths the cephalic plates. Dorsal, rump, and caudal scales about equal, rather larger than the lateral, the former elongated, acutely pointed, with moderate spine, and one lateral denticulation. Inside of tibia and behind anus smooth. Femoral pores twelve. About forty-four oblique rows of scales from occiput to tail; thirty from cervical fold.
Olive gray, with a narrow line of white on each side the back, on the center of a row of scales, the rest of which is black, these lines separated by six rows of scales. Back with a central gray line. Two rows of elongated dusky crescents on the back, about thirteen from head to tail, margined behind by lighter. Two other series less distinct in each side, separated by a broken light line. Two small dark spots on and above the shoulder.
Cat. No, 2884. This species has rather a slender head, its length being one and a half times the width. The large subcordate occipital has three smaller ones on each side. The cephalic plates are 7, 1,1, 2,3, and 4 to those immediately posterior to the single nasal plate, six in number. All are remarkably symmetrical in arrangement. The seven occipital may perhaps be considered as five and two, the latter separated by the large occipital. The last-mentioned series of four is composed of two inner very large, and a lateral small. All are distinctly but moderately rugose transversely.

<<<Page: 427>>>

The lateral gular folds are quite moderate. The scales above are remarkable for being longer than broad. They are thus very acuteangled, decidedly keeled, and sharp, but with little or no projecting mucro. They are notched on each side the point above, very few of them on the belly, more on the chin. There are about thirty-nine or forty scales encircling the thickest part of the body. ‘The legs are very short; the hind feet only about one and one-fourth times the head from snout to end of occipital plates. The scales on the inside of tibia and behind anus are smooth. There are about fourteen femoral pores.
The colors resemble much those of S. graciosus. The ground color above is olivaceous gray. There is a well-defined and narrow line of

Fig. 68. SCELOPORUS SCALARIS WUJGMANN. x %. Cat. No. 2384, U.S.N.M. yellowish white on each side the back, beginning distinctly on the temples in a line with the superciliary ridge. This occupies the center only of a single row of scales, the outer portion of which, and to a certain extent the inner also, is traversed by a well-marked line of black. These lines are separated on the back by six rows of scales. A central light, ashy stripe one and two half scales wide traverses the back, and on each side of these is a series of U-shaped blotches (about fifteen from head to above anus), bordered externally by the light lines. There is a second series of U’s on the side, bounded below by a second interrupted yellow line on the adjacent half rows, the upper one being

<<<Page: 428>>>

the third from that traversed by the first-mentioned yellow line. There are even obscure indications of a third lateral series of dark blotches below this last line. On the back, where most distinet, the U-marks (the convexity behind) have their outline black, bordered behind by whitish (on the tips of scales), the interior filled up first by olive brown and then by grayer. The lateral series are somewhat similar, the lower light line being formed by light borders to adjacent U-shaped blotches of the second and third series. There is a V-shaped mark on the occipital region, the angle anterior, and another behind the nostrils, with an intervening blotch and a transverse bar on the superciliary region. There is a short line above the insertion of the arm and another on the shoulder below it, but no trace of a short perpendicular line. The under parts are uniform whitish. The specimen is a female and lacks the blue of the chin and sides.
This species has the general appearance of S. graciosus, but has the seales above much larger and more elongated. The upper light yellow lines are narrower and more sharply defined, being on one row of scales, separated by six or seven scales, instead of on one and two halves, separated by nine or ten. The U-marks are better defined. There is no trace of the short perpendicular black bar in front of the shoulder and little of the two on the posterior face of the thigh. The U-marks on the head are peculiar. The head is narrower; the plates anteriorly more symmetrical, and decidedly wrinkled instead of small. The feet are much shorter.
From S. consobrinus it differs in the U-shaped marks on the back, the very narrow light lines on the middle of one row instead of on the adjacent edges of two, the rugose plates of the head, the weak feet, the elongated thin scales.

Tympanum more or less distinct. Body depressed, without dorsal crest; dorsal lepidosis heterogeneous. Head covered with small Seales, bordered posteriorly by osseous spines. <A transverse gular fold. Digits with keeled lamelle inferiorly. Femoral pores. Tail short. Lateral teeth subconical or indistinctly tricuspid; no pterygoid teeth. A large sternal fontanelle. No abdominal ribs.
This peculiar genus ranges over the Central, Pacific, and Sonoran districts of Nearctica, and the political State of Mexico. It represents the extreme of the terrestrial habit in the Iguanide, corresponding in this respect to Phynocephalus and Moloch among the Agamide. The latter it resembles in the horny processes of the skull and _ heterogeneous pholidosis, flat and spinous scales being mixed. The body is very flat, and this form can be increased at the will of the animal by the extension or abduction of the ribs which extend the abdominal border. In defense the muzzle is depressed and the horns elevated, as in Mammalia with posterior horns; the back is also arched. Some of the species are said to eject a bloody fluid from the eyes at such a time, but this I have not observed. In life their horns constitute their only defense, as they possess no speed. They are, however, abundant in the dry regions of the southwest, where enemies are few, and where they can take refuge beneath the formidable spines of the Agayves and Yuceas, and the prickles of the Opuntias. They can not be an attractive mouthful to snakes, and I once saw a dead rattlesnake with the horns of a Phrynosoma which it had swallowed penetrating the neck through the upper integument, one on each side of the vertebral column. In confinement Phrynosomas can seldom be induced to eat, and they frequently lay eggs.
Osteology.—The following account of the osteology is derived from the skeletons of three species, P. douglassii, P. cornutum, and P. coronatum. The description applies equally to each of these species unless otherwise stated :
The premaxillary has a very short alveolar portion which does not bound the nostrils below (or very little, P. coronatum). It has a superior spine and concave palatal border. The nasals are distinct and are excavated in front by the large narial openings. The frontal is single, is much narrowed in front by the prefrontals, but extends transversely posterior to the orbits, where it sends forward an acute process in the superciliary angle. The prefrontal is large and extends posteriorly to or beyond the middle of the supraorbital border. It sends posteriorly an acute superciliary process, which meets that of the frontal from behind, over the eye in P. cornutum; does not quite meet it in P. coronatum, and fails to meet it by a longer interval in P. douglassii, The lachrymal is small and is not reached by the anterior angle of the jugal. The parietal is broad and short, and the pineal foramen pierces it at
the coronal suture. Its lateral border is very little decurved to meet the petrosal. :

<<<Page: 430>>>

Its strong parietoquadrate arch supports a horn or tuberosity, and in most of the species the middle of the posterior border supports the same. The occipital is broadly articulated with the parietal in P. douglassii and P. coronatum; in the former loosely, in the latter closely. In P. cornutum it affords a narrow but firm support for the parietal. Paroccipital small, visible from behind. The postfrontal is visible as a rudiment in P. douglassii, but it is apparently coossified in the other two species. The postorbital is slender, expanding below for union with jugal and supratemporal. The former bears two sharp tuberosities in P. coronatum, and the supratemporal two. In P. cornutum there is none on the jugal, but there are three on the supratemporal; and in P. douglassii the arrangement is similar. Owing to the inferior position of the supratemporal, the quadrate is oblique forward and downward. It presents one conch, the external. The vomers are short, and are separated from each other for the posterior half or more of their length by a hiatus, which continues posteriorly of about equal width between the palatine and pterygoid pairs. The latter are short, wide, and flat, and the palatine foramen is small; least and oval in P. coronatum; small and round in P. cornutum; larger and elongate in P. douglassii. The ectopterygoid is decurved at its inner extremity. The presphenoid is wanting, and the suture between the sphenoid and the ‘basioccipital is persistent. The supraforaminal part of the petrosal is very short, and the infraforaminal part is not much produced, and has a wide inferior groove. The epipterygoid originates behind the ecto‘pterygoid process, and has the peculiarity among Iguanidie of not reaching the parietal, but of resting on the anterior border of the petrosal. The occipital condyle shows traces of its tripartite composition. The postoptic is curved and simple and does not reach the frontal bone. The latter is grooved on the middle line below.
_ The groove of Meckel’s cartilage is open throughout in P. cornutum umd P. coronatum and distally only in P. douglassii. The coronoid is ot produced horizontally on the external face of the mandible, and the jentary is not produced beyond its posterior border. This element has reflected inferior border in the P. cornutwm which is acutely dentate osterior to the middle, characters absent from P. coronatum and P. louglassii. In P. douglassii the surangular is not coossified with the ticular, while it is so united in the other two species. The angle is short, and is directed downward and obliquely inward.
_ The basihyal is wide and is ossified, and the second ceratobranchials we very short and widely separated. The hypohyals are short and varry the ceratohyls on their extremities. No expansions of lateral ‘lements.
The vertebre have no zygosphen articulation, but the prezygapophyeal facet is carried upon the side of the neurapophysis at an angle with he usual position. This furnishes the initial step in the production of .zygosphen. I find five cervical intercentra in P. cornutum and P.

<<<Page: 431>>>

coronatum, and six in P. douglassii, exclusive of the intercentrum of the atlas, which has no hypapophysis. Ribs extend to the sacrum, and are attached to very short diapophyses. The two sacral diapophyses are separated by a wide fissure in the P. coronatum and P. douglassii, but are closely appressed in P. cornutum. On one side of the skeleton of P. douglassti the last lumbar vertebra carries, abnormally, a third sacral diapophysis which reaches the ilium. Proximal part of caudal vertebre with long diapophyses. Caudal centra not segmented. Chevron bones intercentral, not uniting distally. Neural spines everywhere very low, those of the caudal vertebre single.
The suprascapula is exceptionally elongate, and the scapula is of moderate length and has a proscapular process. The coracoid has one emargination. The interclavicle is remarkable for the shortness of its posterior limb, which is shorter than the transverse limb in P. cornutum and P. douglassti, aud equal to it in P, coronatum. The sternum has a very large fontanelle which approaches the posterior border. In P. coronatum and P. douglassii three ribs articulate with the sternum, but in P. cornutum two only in my skeleton. The xiphoid rods are widely separated, and carry but one rib.
The ilium has a short angulus criste, and the acetabulum is entire. The pubis and ischium are slender and transverse in position, and approach nearly at their symphyses, which are connected by a short, narrow cartilage. The pectineal process is obsolete, while the tuber ischii is a prominent angle.
Two peculiarities especially distinguish this genus among Iguanide: First, the connection of the epipterygoid with the petrosal, and, second, the absence of symphysis of the chevron bones. The characters of the sternum are an extreme of what is seen in Sceloporus.
Viscera.—The distinction between the large and small intestine is well marked, and there is a large colon, which is set off from the rectum by a strong constriction. The liver is large, and extends farther posteriorly than in any genus of Iguanidw. The left lobe is larger than in any other genus, extending in most species as far posteriorly as the much narrower right lobe. The posterior border is deeply excavated between them. The mesenteries are of the usual type, except that there is aright hepatoventral in addition to the usual one. It has a position so far to the right side as to be as well termed a hepatolateral. The usual hepatoventral, in consequence of the elongation of the left lobe of the liver, which it follows, extends to or nearly to the transverse or cystic mesenteric fold.
The penis in P. asio is short, and terminates glans-like, in which the rims of opposite sides turn inward toward the obtuse apex on one side. As they turn inward they become separated from the remainder of the glans by a groove, which becomes deep and defines a median lobe between them, which forms the apex of the organ. The grooves do not continue on the side opposite to that on which they originate. The surface of the organ is deeply longitudinally plicate, but at the apex

<<<Page: 432>>>

of both lateral and median lobes the plicie inosculate, forming a tripelike structure.
Species.—I distinguish eleven species of this genus, which differ as follows:
I. One series of marginal abdominal scales. a. No enlarged gular scales. b. Nostrils in line with canthi rostrales. Horns reduced to tubercles, the temporals larger than occipitals; infralabials and enlarged dorsal scales not prominent; ventrals smooth. P. douglassii Bell.

These species may be also grouped as follows, by consideration of
certain characters of the squamation : I. Several subrictal projecting plates; temporal row of conic plates not continued to below orbit. Large dorsal scales without rosette at base. Two occipital
horns. Femoral pores in the interior of scuta. P. orbiculare; P. douglassii; P. boucardii; P. braconnierii.

The attempt has been made to define more than one genus from the characters presented by the above species. One of the characters viewed as indicating this result is the varying position of the nostrils as regards the canthus rostralis. On this basis the P. coronatum might be as readily referred to one division as the other, as it is in this respect exactly intermediate. Such a division would violate the affinities expressed in the second table. This is, however, not an insuperable objection, as allied genera not infrequently possess parallel series of species,
The largest species is the southwest Mexican P. asio. It is remarkable for the reduction of its temporal horns to two on each side, and the large size of its superciliary horns, which equal the posterior temporal and occipital in length. The P. taurus, from southeastern Mexico, is remarkable for the presence of only one temporal spine, which is very large, and the abortion of all the other spines, of which the occipital are represented by rudiments. Eleven species are known, three being restricted to the tropical parts of Mexico, namely, P. asio, P. taurus, and P. braconnierit.
Habits.—Under the head of Phrynosoma douglassii, Dr. Stejneger! thus writes of the metachrosis, which is so observable in this genus:
Much has been written in regard to the perfection with which these animals “imitate” the color of the ground on which they live, and our own observations fully verified the statement that they afford one of the most striking examples of protective mimicry.
In the cedar and pine belts of the San Francisco Mountain the dark color of the soil and stones covering the surface is closely matched by the ground color of the Phrynosomas, while the greenish gray and orange colored markings, which somewhat irregularly adorn their backs, are perfect imitations of the lichens covering the rocks and pebbles amoung which these odd-looking creatures live. Near the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, on the other hand, the ground is covered with small pebbles of variously colored sandstone, ranging from a clayey white to brick red and dark brown, and the specimen which I collected there (No. 15724) is such a faithful reproduction of the surroundings that it would undoubtedly have remained undetected had it not been moving. Even more remarkable are the specimens which Dr. Merriam collected in the black lava belt, east and northeast of the mountain. One of these (No. 15815) was brought to camp alive, enabling me to make the following description of the fresh colors: ‘‘Ground color of upper side, including head, satiny black; light markings on median third of body dull ‘Naples yellow,’ abruptly changing into the yellow ocher of those on the sides; tips of most lateral spines

white; tips of largest cephalic spines marbled with ocher; underside yellowish white, densely marbled with blackish; collar, light ocher yellow.” In these specimens even the gloss of the black lava was imitated.

Outline of head from above, parabolic; profile of muzzle descending steeply and convex to a projecting lip border. Temporal region wide, but not especially expanded. Nostril in the line of the canthus rostralis. Horns represented by conical protuberances on each side. Three temporals and one occipital, of which the occipital is about as prominent as the second temporal and less so than the third temporal. Occipitals widely separated at base. The temporal row of scales is continued to below the orbit, but the latter are not prominent. Scales of vertex convex, rugose; occipital and two posterior to it, with one within and adjoining the posterior superciliary, a little larger than the . others. Six posterior inferior labials enlarged, the most posterior with produced angles, forming a series of subrictals. One series of enlarged infralabials, which are not so prominent and do not extend as far posteriorly as the subrictals. Two short oblique rows of conic seales on the side of the neck, the superior the longer. Two large scales in vertical relation behind nasal, and separated from it by a row of smaller seales. A small keystone superciliary. Gular scales rounded, smooth.
Median dorsal scales flat, keeled, of irregular sizes, but not so large as in the species of the cornutum or coronatum groups. Lateral dorsal seales rounded, smaller, but not so small as in the coronatum group. The large isolated keeled scales are less conspicuous than in the other groups and are in about four rows on each side. They are not surrounded by a rosette at base. A single series of moderately elongateclosely placed marginal scales, commencing anterior to the groin and

<<<Page: 435>>>

terminating above posterior to the axilla. A singlé prominent scale above the humerus. A series of conic scales on each side of the tail, which are not so prominent as the large keeled spinous scales which project from among the flat ones of its superior surface. Superior face of arm and cubitus covered with large acute keeled scales; of leg and thigh with smaller scales, among which large prominent keeled and Spinous scales are mingled. Scales of inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the distal part of the cubitus, the distal half of the tail, and of the palms and soles, which are keeled. Lateral digital scales not produced.
The legs are shorter than in any other North American species, the posterior ones when extended reaching barely three-fourths the distance to the axilla. The tail varies in length in the subspecies from about twice the head in the typical form to more than three times in the subspecies hernandesii. Femoral pores, sixteen on each thigh, the series approaching but not meeting on the middle line.
Measurements.—Total length, 111 mm.; length to vent, 80 mm.; length to gular fold, 19 mm.; length of head with occipital horn, 19 mm.; length of head without a horn, 17 mm.; width at temporal region, 23 mm.; length of fore leg, 32 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 40 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm.
The ground color of the superior surface of this species is variable and under the control of the animal in a large degree. It may be pale, ashy, brown, reddish, or nearly black. There is no distinct vertebral stripe. There is a large dark nuchal spot on each side and three double dorsal spots on each side of the body. These spots may be separate or fused, in the latter case forming a cross band with posterior bilobate outline. They are ill defined anteriorly, but posteriorly they are well defined, and frequently have a pale or even bright colored border, Tail and limbs obscurely cross-banded above; head uniform brown.
Inferior surfaces uniform cream-colored, unspotted, except on the gular region, where small black spots are frequently present. The small cranial horns are frequently pink.
This species has much the most northern range of all the Phrynosomas, inhabiting Oregon, parts of Washington, and Montana. To the eastward it extends into Montana, Nebraska, and Kansas, and to the south to Soccoro, New Mexico, and middle Arizona. It does not oceur in Texas, so far as known. It is thus especially characteristic of the central region and the northern part of the Pacific. Within this range it presents three modifications. Specimens from the northern Pacific region are of smaller size than those from the Central region, and the tail is Short; a larger brighter-colored and also short-tailed form from the deserts of the great basin, and a larger and long-tailed form from the Rocky Mountain region and eastward.

<<<Page: 436>>>

Dr. Elliott Coues thus describes the habits of this species as observed by him:!
Like other species of the same genus, this Phrynosoma is slow of foot and readily captured; if makes an interesting pet to one fond of observing the traits of lower animals. It may readily be secured by a thread tied behind its “horns,” and in this state of partial liberty its habits may be studied to advantage. It is one of the most inoffensive and amiable of reptiles, though some of the largest and boldest individuals sometimes make a slight demonstration in self-defense by biting weakly. It usually submits at once without remonstrance. When handled, it has a way of making itself perfectly flat, when, closing its eyes, it will simulate death in this collapsed state. Under some circumstances it will swell up the body prodigiously till it assumes a nearly spherical shape. It hasa sly way of watching for a chance to escape by bolting away when it thinks itself unobserved, and a still more curious knack of burying itself in sand or other loose soil. This is accomplished by a gradual lateral and forward insinuating wriggling of the body, with the muzzle pointed downward and the limbs drawn close to the sides. A few moments suffice for its disappearance. A certain slight means of defense which the “horns” may sometimes afford is shown by the use they are put to when the animal is irritated by poking with a finger or bit of a stick; then the head is lowered, the horns set forward, the back arched up, and the whole attitude becomes ludicrously like that of abullin miniature. The horned lizards show special aversion to dogs. On approach of one they raise themselves to the full length of the legs, puff out the body, open the mouth, and hiss audibly, altogether presenting quite a formidable front. Their food, in confinement and otherwise, consists chiefly of flies and other insects, which they capture by a quick thrust of the fleshy tongue, lubricated with viscid saliva. I have not observed the time of coition nor the period of gestation, but most of the females are found pregnant in July, and the young appear in great numbers in August. The male is usually smaller than the female and of slenderer form.
The varieties of this species have been distinguished by Girard as species, and they have been thus defined by Stejueger :”
Size small; horns rudimental; tail short; colors obseure...-.....-.P. d. douglassii. Size larger; median horns directed posteriorly; tail longer; body more spinous; COMMTSPOOSCUL OMe anaes ateiae et oe ne aie = Scape ioe ae Meese ee P. d. hernandezii.
Size largest ; median horns directed upward; colors more brilliant. P. d. ornatissimum.
An examination of a large series of specimens shows that the above characters define races which do not seem to me to be sufficiently distinct to represent subspecies. Thus the direction of the occipital horns is not constantly associated with other characters, and the length of the tail of some specimens and of P. d. ornatissimum is equal to that of some individuals of P. d. hernandesi.

On the elevated land which represents the Sierra Nevada Range, between Warners Lake and Goose Lake, in the basaltic region near the former, I found a peculiar variety of this species. The horns are

even more rudimentary than in the usual form, but are all represented. The prominent scales of the back are smaller and less prominent. In some of the specimens the head is shorter relatively to the body. The color is an iron-rust brown, with darker lateral spots, each with a small posterior yellow border. Individuals are abundant; some of those taken are full of eggs. All are much smaller than P. douglassii hernandesi. This form is confined to the northern part of the Pacific district.

In this form the “‘ temporal” (supratemporal) region is produced farther posteriorly than in the typical examples of P. d. hernandesi, so that the occipital emargination is deeper. The young present the form characteristic of the latter species; however, this character may be associated with long-tailed specimens of obscure coloration, The tail of the female

<<<Page: 441>>>

of the P. d. ornatissimum is very short, but in the male it is sometimes more than half the length of the head and body, as in P. hernandesi. The typical coloration consists of dark-brown spots surrounded by a yellow border on the dorsal region, but the yellow border may be visible on the posterior side of the spot, as in P. hernandesi. The spots may also extend to the sides, as in that form I do not find the differences in the form of the head to be constant, although in typical forms that of the P. d. ornatissimum is more obtuse than in the P. d. hernandesi.

General color sienna brown. On the neck and back, on each side of the vertebral line, are four transverse brown or black spots outlined with yellow; tail and limbs crossed likewise by brown bands. Underside covered with confluent black spots on a yellowish-white ground color. (Bocourt.)
Bocourt distinguishes three varieties of this lizard, which differ as follows:
Occipital horns longer than temporal; occipital scales large....P. orbiculare typicum. Occipital horns shorter than longest temporal; occipital scales large.
P. orbiculare var. A. Occipital horns shorter than longest temporal; occipital scales smaller, numerous.
P. orbiculare var. B.

<<<Page: 444>>>

The typical form has been received at the Museum of Paris from the States of Vera Cruz and Pueblo, and from the Mexican Plateau. Our specimens are from the northern plateau at Chihuahua and southern Arizona. The var. A came from the high lands of Vera Cruz, and the var. B from Colima, on the west coast.

Head, thick; wider than long. Cephalic spines of moderate length; those of the occiput directed obliquely upward, a little more prolonged backward than the longest ones of the temporal region. Numerous occipital tubercles. Trihedral scales of the body projecting. Abdominal scales smooth. Head with top relatively narrow, not equal half its greatest length; the contour from the end of the muzzle to the superciliary angle a little curved oblique line. Inframaxillary scutella reetangular, a little smaller than the posterior sublabials; one conical, pyramidal scale at the junction of the lips; nostrils pierced on the prolonged superciliary ridge; auricular opening bordered anteriorly with smal) projecting scales; occipital plate distinct, oval, and followed by numerous conical scales; upper part of the body bristling with projecting trihedral tubercles. Eleven to fourteen pores on the inner side of the thigh; tail about two-fifths the length of the animal and characterized in the males by a little greater length, a thicker base, and by two postanal scales somewhat larger than the others. A fringe around the periphery of the abdomen formed of twenty-six or twenty-seven large trihedral, subpyramidal scales; four similar scales over each arm; length of tibia equal to the distance between the end of the snout and the beginning of the occipital spines; scales of the belly and the underside of the tail smooth; those of the throat feebly keeled.
Ground color ocher yellow, with four brown spots extending on both sides of the vertebral line; the one on the neck large and rounded, the three others, on the trunk, subrectangular, with bright yellow posterior borders; legs and tail crossed by similar brown bands; head and cephalic spines sienna brown. Underside yellowish, with rounded blackish spots scattered far apart.
Phrynosoma boucardii, like Phrynosoma orbiculare, has a var. A, head wider than long, but it is easy to distinguish the latter by the following

<<<Page: 445>>>

characters: Interorbital space narrower; occipital spines implanted obliquely; occipital tubercles smaller, and consequently more numerous; trihedral scales of all parts of the body more bristling; and the gular scales feebly keeled and not entirely smooth. (Bocourt.)
The erect direction of the occipital spines of this species distinguishes —
it from the others of the orbiculare group.
No specimens of the Phrynosoma boucardii are in the U.S. National Museum. M. Bocourt’s specimens came from the ‘“ Plateau of Mexico,” without further specification of locality.

Outline of muzzle from above broadly rounded; in profile abruptly descending without conspicuous angle with front, nor prominent lip border. Nostrils presenting anteriorly only, the nasal plates separated by a row of scales from the series of the canthus rostralis, which pass externally to them. Temporal region considerably expanded. Posterior superciliary angle produced horizontally. Four occipital horns of subequal length, the external pair slightly divergent, and all directed backward 45°. Each horn depressed, and with the basal portions marked with flat tubercles. Only three prominent temporal scales, and all of these produced into horns, which are flat and recurved to the acute tips. The posterior, which is the longest, is not equal to the external occipital. Temporal row of scales not produced to below the orbit, but a row of protuberant scales above it reaches the same point. Scales of top of head flat, tubercular. Two transverse rows of conic scales, of four scales each, posterior to the occipital, the external of the posterior row the largest. No angle or row of larger scales connecting the posterior superciliaries. A well-developed keystone plate. Infralabials eight on each side, all prominent except the anterior three, the seventh largest and as long as the anterior temporal Spine, the eighth smaller and spiniform. No subrictal. Enlarged gulars in a single row, with acute apices, the posterior not enlarged. Two rows of spines on the side of the neck, the superior shorter and more bunehy.
Dorsal scales flat, the median much larger than the lateral, keeled, and with small, round tubercles on the plane portions. Four spaced rows of larger keeled scales on each side of the middle line, those of the external rows much smaller than those of the median, These extremities are scarcely free, but those of the penultimate row are most prominent, espec ially anteriorly, where the external row is wanting. Lateral fringe continued to above humerus from groin, its

lanceolate scales closely placed. Seales of the short inferior row quite small, and separated from the superior by small, round scales separated by interspaces. Arm and forearm covered above with large keeled and mucronate seales, of thigh with small keeled scales, mixed with large, more or less free, keeled scales, and tibia with large keeled and mucronate scales, with a few small ones intermixed.

Tail with two lateral fringes of conic scales at the base, the inferior row short and composed of small scales, the superior continued to near the end of the tail. Superior pholidosis of tail irregular, with larger and smaller keeled and tubercular scales, which are more or less free at the apices. Keeled scales of humeri continued across thorax on clavicular angle. Median gular scales rounded. Scales of

<<<Page: 447>>>

inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the tibia and forearm, which are keeled and mucronate. Collar serrate except at middle. The hind leg extended falls short of the axilla. The tail is rather long, exceeding by a little twice the length of the head without the horns. First and fifth toes of equal length on both extremities. Femoral pores. eleven to fifteen on each side, the rows continuous on the median line, or nearly so.
Measurements (Sonora).—Total length, 140 mm.; length to vent, 89 mm.; length to gular fold, 19.5mm.; length of head with horns, 32 mm.; length of head without horns, 22 mm.; Width of head at temporal region, 19 mm.; length of fore leg, 40 mm.; length of fore foot, 12 mm.; length of hind leg, 49 mm.; length of hind foot, 20 mm. :
General color above light brown; median line pale; lateral nuchal spots present, obscure; three or four pairs of blackish blotches on each side of the median line, which are of irregular outline, coneave forward, and not fused into transverse bands; tail and limbs with broad, brown cross bands; inferior surfaces immaculate; head light brown, horns paler.
This species occupies an isolated position in the genus for several reasons. The presence of four equally developed occipital horns instead of the two which characterize all the other species, the continuity of the femoral pore series across the middle line, and the tubereulation of the scales are the principal ones. The squamation is like that of the coronatum group, but in the short series of scales ending in the temporal horns it is more like the cornutum group, with which it also agrees in the matters of infralabials and inferior gular scales.
Specimens of this species display some noteworthy differences. In two Arizona individuals the temporal and occipital horns are in a single slightly curved plane. In the specimen from Sonora, above described, the second and third (posterior) temporals are on a distinetly lower plane. In Cat. No. 161, also from Sonora, these horns are depressed, but less so. In Cat. No. 8437, from Arizona, the series of femoral pores are separated on the middle line by four rows of scales, and the pores number on one side eighteen and on the other twenty. In Cat. No. 17179, from Tucson, the series include twenty pores each, and are separated by one scale on the middle line. In my Sonoran individual but one scale separates the adjacent pores of opposite rows, and the latter contain 11-12 pores. In Cat. No. 161 each row contains seventeen pores, and five rows separate them at the middle. In Cat. No. 8437 there is on each side of the superior side of the tail, beyond the base, a tetrahedral conic scale looking directly upward, which is wanting in the Sonoran specimen. In Cat, No. 8437 one has seven and the other eight large infralabials; there are seven in the Sonoran individual. Cat. No. 17179 has seven on one side and eight on the other. No other differences are observable.

It is with regret that | adopt for this species the name of Gray in preference to that of Girard. The description of Gray is unworthy of the name, being only a line in length, and may apply to this or to some unknown species so far as its terms go. Moreover, he evidently did not regard it as a good species, but placed his specimen under the head of P, blainvillei, as belonging to that species. An examination of the specimen in the British Museum showed me that it is to an example of the P. regale, that the name P. solare applies, and as technically one line is a description, I am compelled to side this time with the pettifoggers, and adopt it.

series of four conic scales in front of the base of th2 occipital horns, and a similar one between the bases of the latter. Anterior and posterior superciliary plates in contact, with a small “ keystone ” below their opposed apices. Dorsal pholidosis irregular. Medially the scales are flat and keeled, but they become much smaller and graniform laterally, where they are separated by smaller granules. A band of smaller flat scales, down the vertebral line, bounded by larger scales on each side. External to these there are four rows of well-separated, large, keeled scales, with —

free apices directed posteriorly, without a circle of scales around their bases. A marginal fringe of flat lanceolate scales, extending from anterior to the groin to above the shoulder, and a lower marginal series of much smaller scales along the middle part of the lateral border. Between the superior row and the larger dorsal scales are several longitudinal folds, surmounted each with a series of oval keeled scaies larger than those that surround them. Superior surfaces of fore limb with large keeled mucronate scales, mixed with a few of smaller size. Upper surface of posterior limb with small scales, and scattered large keeled spinous scales. Tail with a lateral fringe of large, flat, lanceolate scales to near the extremity; the superior surface with irregular pholidosis of flat keeled scales, some with projecting apices. Scales of all the inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the humerus and tibia, which are weakly keeled. Keeled scales of front of humerus not continued across the middle line.
Extended hind leg reaching to axilla or middle of humerus. Tail a little over twice as long as head without horns. Femoral pores fifteen in each row, which is separated from the opposite one by a wide interspace.
Measurements (San Diego, California).—Total length, 147 mm.; length to vent, 92 mm.; length to gular fold, 20 mm.; length of head with occipital horn, 32 mm.; length of head without occipital horn, 22 mm. width of head at temporal region, 23 mm.; length of fore leg, 43 mm. ; length of fore foot, 26 mm.; length of hind leg, 57 mm.; length of hind foot, 23 mm.
Color above light brown; head light-yellowish brown, without darker markings. Temporal spines light red or pink, occipital horns mahogany brown, with reddish apices; the ridges darker than the grooves. Lateral nuchal brown spots large, well separated. Between these and the groin on each side three dusky brown bilobate cross bands, obscurely defined anteriorly; in young specimens with imperfect posterior light border. Inferior surface of limbs and tail with a few obscure crossbars. Inferior surfaces immaculate, except a few obscure dusky spots on the abdomen in some individuals.
This species inhabits the southern part of the Pacifie district, that is, California south of San Francisco Bay, and the upper part of the peninsula of Lower California, at least as far south as San Thomas (Van Denburgh). In the northern part of the Pacific district its place is taken by the P. douglassii. No other species occupies the range of the P. blainvillei.
Mr. Van Denburgh states that specimens from the northern part of this range have the head scales less convex and more rugose than in those from the southern portion of it, and he proposes to regard the former as a distinct species, under the name of P. frontale. No other character is advanced by Mr. Van Denburgh, so that specific distinctness can scarcely be admitted. Perhaps a race is indicated. Its value appears, however, to be problematical, as specimens in my possession

<<<Page: 451>>>

from San Diego, in the extreme south, have the head scales strongly rugose, although convex. : Mr. Van Denburgh points out that this species differs from the P., coronatum in the presence of a spine behind the subrictal scale, a character which I find to be quite constant. I may add that the P. coro-. natum is more horny as to the peripheral parts of the skull. There are four horns of the temporal series, of which the anterior is below the eye. In P. blainvillet this scale is little or not larger than the one that succeeds it. In P. blainvillei a postorbital row of scales is very protuberant, and not so in P. coronatum. In P. blainvillei there is but one row of scales in the marginal fringe of the tail, while there are two in P. coronatum. Habits.—Dr. Stejneger states that it is to P. blainvillei that the published accounts about ejecting blood from the eyes should be credited, and one of the specimens in the collection brought home (Cat. No. 18452) is the offender who gave rise to Dr. O. P. Hay’s entertaining article! on this subject. It transpired afterwards that this specimen had been sent me alive for the very reason that it had been ejecting blood repeatedly when caught. The letter from Mr. Bailey accompanying the specimen turned up long after Dr. Hay’s experience with the animal, and
it is to the following effect: KERNVILLE, CAL., July 11, 1891.
Dear Sir: I caught a horned toad to-day that very much surprised Dr. Fisher and myself by squirting blood from its eyes. It was on smooth ground and not in brush or weeds. I caught it with my hand and just got my fingers on its tail as it ran. On taking it in my hand a little jet of blood spurted from one eye a distance of 15 inches and spattered on my shoulder. Turning it over to examine the eye, another stream spurted from the other eye. This he did four or five times from both eyes until my hands, clothes, and gun were sprinkled over with fine drops of bright red blood. I put it ina bag and carried it to camp, where, about four hours later, I showed it to Dr. Fisher, when it spurted three more streams from its eyes. One of the same species that I caught July 2 evidently did the same, as I found its head covered with blood when I caught it, but supposed it was injured in the weeds. It
seems so strange that I send the horned toad to you alive. VERNON BAILEY.
The specimen upon its arrival was handled a great deal, but gave no evidence of its blood-squirting tendencies until the beginning of August, when it resented Dr. Hay’s handling it somewhat roughly in the manner related. In order to give the entire history of this animal, I reprint Dr. Hay’s account as follows: |
About the Ist of August it was shedding its outer skin, and the process appeared to be a difficult one, since the skin was dried and adhered closely. One day it occurred to me that it might facilitate matters if I should give the animal a wetting; so, taking it up, I carried it to a wash basin of water near by and suddenly tossed the lizard into the water. The first surprise was probably experienced by the Phrynosoma, but the next surprise was my own, for on one side of the basin there suddenly appeared a number of spots of red fluid, which resembled blood. ...A microscope was soon procured and an examination was made, which immediately showed that the matter ejected was really blood.
Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., XV, 1892, pp. 375-378.

<<<Page: 452>>>

~The affair now became very interesting. Just where the blood came from I could not determine with certainty, the whole thing having happened so suddenly and unexpectedly; yet the appearance seemed to indicate that the blood came from the region about one of the eyes. There appeared to be a considerable quantity of the blood, since on the sides of the vessel and on the wall near it I counted ninety of the little splotches. A consultation was had with Dr. Stejneger the next day with regard to the propriety of dashing the animal into the water again to discover, if possible, where the blood came from. It was thought, however, that such blood lettings must be somewhat exhausting, and that it would be better to allow the animal a day to recuperate. While talking, I picked up the lizard and was holding it between my thumb and middle finger and stroking its horns with my forefinger. All at once a quantity of blood was thrown out against my fingers, and a portion of it ran down on the animal’s neck; and this blood came directly out of the right eye. It was shot backward and appeared to issue from the outer canthus. It was impossible to determine just how much there was of the blood, but it seemed there must have been a quarter of a teaspoonful. I went so far as to taste a small quantity of it, but all that I could detect was a slight musky flavor.

occipital and divergent in direction. Occipital horn straight, acute, divergent, slightly grooved at base, directed posteriorly at an angle of 45°. Seales of front flat, rugose, large; those of supraocular series in contact. No angle connecting superciliary angles. Four conic scales in a transverse series in front of occiput; a median occipital conic scale. No prominent scales between the temporal series and the orbit. Only five infralabials on each side, the last prominent and anterior to the line of the larger subrictal. A conic scale or spine in the line of the infralabials, behind the subrictal. Three rows of enlarged gulars on each side, the external conic and acute, and continued to the gular fold. Behind the line of the tympanic meatus two longitudinal rows of scales, the inferior of two spiniform, the superior of five or six simply conic.
Five to eight rows of flat-keeled scales on the median dorsal region; some of which, forming an irregular row on each side, are much larger than the others. External to these the scales are rounded and much smaller, and are separated by granules. On each side of the middle line are three rows (including the one above mentioned) of large, prominent-keeled scales, well separated from each other. A single series of free lanceolate scales forms a lateral fringe, which begins in front of the groin and returns to above the humerus, with an interruption above the axilla. Below this the scales are granular, and then gradually enlarge into the ventrals, which are smooth and about as large as the median dorsals. Superior sides of humerus and cubitus covered with large keeled scales; femur and tibia above with small, flat scales mixed with large accuminate ones. Tail with two series of lateral marginal conic scales, the superior row sparse. Scales of superior surface of tail heterogeneous, but no produced cones. Scales of inferior surfaces of limbs smooth, except those of palm and sole, which are keeled. Lateral digital scales not produced.
The extended hind limb falls considerably short of the axilla. The tail is between once and twice the length of the head without horns. Femoral pores 17 or 18 in each series, which are well separated on the middle line.
Measurements (Cat. No, 11977).—Total length, 112 mm.; length to vent, 85 mm.; length to gular fold, 17 mm.; length to base of occipital horn, 17 mm.; length to end of occipital horn, 23.5 mm.; width at temporal region, 21.5 mm.; length of fore leg, 34 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 46 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm.
Ground color brownish ashen, paler on the limbs and tail. A large brown lateral nuchal spot, and three irregular cross bands on the back, the third at the groin. Each cross band displays a deep noteh posteriorly, and the external portion extends posteriorly, joining the one behind it, causing the flanks to be entirely brown. No distinct cross bands on limbs and tail; snout and muzzle brown; occipital horns mahogany. Inferior surfaces cream-colored, with a few indistinct dusky spots on the abdomen.

<<<Page: 455>>>

As already shown, this species is an ally of the P. coronatum and P. blainvillei, between which it stands in some respects, while it adds some characters of its own. Of the latter kind are the absence of the inferior lateral fringe, the cylindric horns, and the continuation of the enlarged gulars to the gular fold. It agrees with the P. blainvillet in the presence of a spine behind the subrictal, the absence of a prom-
‘inent row of tubercles behind the orbit, in the small size of the interoccipital scale, and the straightness of the occipital horns. It agrees with the P. coronatum in the suborbital cone, the double fringe of the tail, and the flat head scales. But one specimen of this species is known. It was brought from Cerros Island, which is off the west coast of Lower California, at about the middle of its length.

The nostrils are pierced in the lines joining the superciliary ridges with the end of the snout. There are several longitudinal series of large, pointed, gular scales, the exterior of which are continued back upon the gular folds. There is a series of fine, very large, pointed sublabial plates. The head spines are very large. There are four temporals, one occipital, and one postorbital on each side, and one large interoccipital. Occasionally small spines are developed between the temporals. Below the rictus is a broad spine, usually without any, but sometimes with a very small spine behind it. There is a row of four or five spinose scales in front of the occipital spines. The other head scales, with few exceptions, are flat and rugose, usually with irregular

ridges radiating from near the center of each scale. There are two groups of spines on each side of the neck, the lower larger. The tail is bordered with a single row of lateral spines and bears a group of smaller ones behind the insertion of the thigh. There are two series of periphero-abdominal spines, the lower shorter than the upper and formed of smaller spines. The scales on the chest are sometimes faintly keeled. Those on the abdomen and basal part of the tail are smooth; on the terminal part of tail, keeled. The tympanum is naked. There are from sixteen to twenty-two femoro-preanal pores. The males have enlarged postanal plates. The tails of the females are shorter than the distance from the axilla to the front of the thigh, but those of the male are considerably longer than this distance. The young of

both sexes have short tails. The color above is brownish, yellowish, or grayish, darker laterally. There is a large brown patch on each side of the neck, and a series of three more or less distinct brown bars on each side of the back. These bars are light-bordered posteriorly. The tail is transversely banded with brown. The belly is often dotted or blotched with brown or black. All these markings are more distinct inthe young. The larger dorsal tubercles are often tipped with orangerufous, and those on each side of the median line have seal-brown or black keels. The occipital spines are ribbed with very dark brown. The temples are yellow tinged with rufous. In very young individuals the scales of the vertex are grayish or yellowish-white, with a few minute brown or black spots. These spots, which are on the raised portions of the scales, become more numerous as the animals increase

in size, until the whole crown appears black or dark brown, crossed by irregular lines formed by the yellow posterior edges of the scales.
Phrynosoma coronatum was first described from a specimen collected by Botta in “California.” It has since been recorded from Cape St. Lucas and La Paz. The specimens enumerated below show that it ranges far north of the limits of the “Cape Region.”

median equal to or longer than the posterior one; all directed outward at an angle of 45 degrees. The series does not extend to below tie orbit. Occipital horns moderate, acute, well separated, slightly divergent, and directed 45 degrees upward. Scales of front and vertex ragose, three conic scales posterior to the occipital, the posterior ¢ median occipital. A row of conic scales connecting posterior superciliary angles in front of parietal. Infralabials prominent and acute posteriorly, the last equal to or longer than the first temporal. One row of enlarged gulars. No subrictal spine. On each side of the posterior gular border a small spine. Two longitudinal folds on the side of

the neck, several spinous scaies on the inferior and longer, and one on the superior and shorter. Below the inferior an oblique series descends forward to the plane of the enlarged gulars.
Dorsal scales larger, flat, and keeled medially, graduating to smaller ones laterally. A row of large, flat, keeled scales on each side of the vertebral line. External to these, on each side, about four series of enlarged keeled scales, with free apices directed posteriorly, and situated at considerable intervals. The scales of the internal row are considerably larger than those of the external. Gular scales small, rounded, sometimes keeled. Ventrals weakly keeled or smooth. Superior surface of humerus and cubitus covered with large keeled and mucronate scales, with very few small ones intermixed. Femur and tibia covered above with smaller keeled scales, with a few large spinous ‘seales intermixed. Large keeled scales of humerus extended across
the clavicular ridge. Two rows of spinous scales on each side, the NAT MUS 98——28

superior row consisting of larger spines and continued beyond the inferior row to above the humerus. Tail with a marginal row of spines on the basal half and intermixed larger scales on the superior surface, A second and short row of marginal scales below the longer one, extending posteriorly from the posterior base of the femur. Scales on inferior faces of limbs and tail, except the femur, keeled, the tail most strongly.
The hind limbs are short, not reaching the axilla. Tail scarcely or less than twice as long as head without the horns. Femoral pores present in males only, 9-12 in each series, which are well separated on the abdomen.
Measurements (Cat. No. 8316).—Total length, 148 mm.; length to vent, 104 mm.; length to gular fold, 24 mm.; length to end of occipital horn, 32 mm.; length to base of occipital horn, 21 mm.; width at temporal spines, inclusive, 36 mm.; length of fore leg, 47 min.; length of fore foot, 17 mm.; length of hind leg, 61 mm.; length of hind foot, 24 mm.
Color above brown, divided by a narrow paler vertebral stripe. A dark brown spot on each side of the nape, and two rows of three oval or round dark brown spots on each side of the back. Those of the last two pairs are sometimes confluent into two irregular transverse bands. The brown spots have sometimes pale borders. Three dark brown cross bands on top of head, and three dark brown bands from the orbit, the anterior two to the infralabials, the last to the extremity of the second temporal horn. Occipital horns reddish brown. Legs and tail with rather smoke brown cross-bands. Inferior surfaces cream color, sometimes with small scattered dusky spots.
The range of this species exceeds that of any other Phrynosoma. It extends from Dallas, Texas, on the east to Chihuahua, inclusive, on the the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south to southern Kansas and Colorado on the north. It does not occur on the Pacifie slope. It is very common in Texas and south to Monterey, Mexico, and in New Mexico as far north as Taos. Like other species of the genus, it loves dry places and sunshine. It has a habit of running in roads, where a good many are killed in ruts, yet a larger number climb out and escape, to the surprise of the traveler, who thinks they are doomed to death. They are favorites as pets, and if they will eat, live a considerable time in confinement. They not infrequently, however, starve themselves to death, though their capacity to live without food is marvelous. The horns of this species are more acute than those of any of the others, which makes it more dangerous as an article of diet for snakes. I once found a dead snake with the occipital horns of this species protruding on opposite sides of the vertebral column near the head.
A specimen with smooth abdominal scales was the basis of the nominal species P. planifrons.

This genus only differs from Phrynosoma in the concealment of the — tympanic drum by the integument, which is scaly. Girard has pro— posed another name for it on the ground that Anota is preoccupied. — But this is not the case, as such names as Anotia, Anotus, ete., cannot — be regarded as identical with Anota. ;
Four species are known to me, which differ as follows:
I. No marginal abdominal fringe of elongated scales, a. No enlarged gular scales.
b. Nostrils above or within the canthus rostralis. Horns moderate; posterior temporal about equal to occipital; enlarged — dorsal scales not prominent; ventrals smooth; small. 4. modesta Girard. — II.

The last-named three species resemble each other more nearly than they do the A. modesta. They agree in having the spinous seale with its basal circle above the humerus more conspicuously developed, and in the enlargement of those scales of the head posterior to the parietal. The lateral scales of the digits are also more elongate and prominent. Their femoral pores are at the margin of the large seale, the smaller posterior ones forming a half rosette. In the A. modesta they are mostly pierced within the border of the large scale, and rarely in a rosette.

nate tubercles from below the front of the orbit, of which the posterior only is distinctly a horn. It is directed posteriorly, having usually the same direction and length of the occipital. One short acute occipital horn on each side; nointeroccipital. Posterior superciliary plate angular, but not prominent. Infralabials increasing regularly in size to the posterior, which are not very prominent. Gularscales equal. <A strong prehumeral fold, in front of which is a fossa, and in front of this a semicircular fold convex backward with a few larger tubercles on its border. Cephalic scales rugose with points and ridges. Supraorbitals partly separated by a single row of scales. Central supraoculars equal supraorbitals. Anterior and posterior superciliaries separated by two scales.
Dorsal scales of irregular sizes, the median keeled. On each side of the middle line four rows of widely separated transversely oval scales, with a longitudinal keel and apex slightly raised above the general level, and with a few large scales (smaller than those just mentioned) at their bases, which do not form complete annuli. These large scales alternate in their respective rows, though not regularly, and a few flat scales of intermediate size are scattered between them. Scales of superior surfaces of limbs of irregular sizes, keeled, and larger than those of inferior surfaces, which are smooth except on the tibia, where they are keeled. Scales of inferior surfaces of head and body smooth,
The hind limb appressed to the side reaches to or nearly to the shoulder. The tail is swollen at the base and then contracts abruptly, the remainder being sleuder and compressed cylindric. Its pholidosis is irregular, but it has no lateral fringe. Femoral pores forming a continuous series across the belly, and numbering from ten to twelve on each side of the middle line.
Measurements (Cat. No. 8316).—Total length, 95 mm.; length to vent, 55 mm.; length to gular fold, 15 mm.; length of head above to end of occipital horn, 18.5 mm.; length of head above base of occipital horn, 13.5 mm.; greatest temporal width of head, 21 mm.; length of fore leg, 29 mm.; length of fore foot, 10 mm.; length of hind leg, 35 mm; length of hind foot, 15 mm.
In life the color of this species is a light yellowish brown, sometimes with a shade of pink. A blackish spot begins on each side of the nape and extends round to a point anterior to the humerus. There is sometimes a sooty shade on each side from the middle to the groin. A small blackish spot behind the vent on the middle line, and frequently a Similar spot on each side of the anterior border of the vent. There are no dorsal spots or crossbars, but the tail is indistinctly annulate with blackish. Under surfaces pale yellowish, immaculate, except the gular region, which is generally indistinctly dusky spotted.
This small species ranges from western Texas to Arizona and Chihuahua, inclusive. General Pope sent it from the head waters of the Colorado, on the eastern side of the Llano Estacado, and I traced it

the ground scales are smaller, flat, and not keeled. They are interrupted by a few keeled scales. Besides these there is a number of rows of larger keeled scales, which are free posteriorly and are surrounded by a rosette at the base. The least prominent are those near the middle line; just external to these are the largest. They diminish in size toward the lateral borders. There are large keeled scales on the shoulder. This tract divides, the wider band extending on the posterior face of the humerus; the narrower, only one scale wide, extending on the anterior side 10 the elbow. The scales of the external side are of mixed sizes, and are larger than those of the internal side. The scales of the external face of the femur and tibia are like those of the dorsal region. Tail subround, bordered by a fringe of rather widely spaced conic seales,
Head scales moderately rough, tending to present a single tubercle larger than the others; scales of inferior surfaces smooth. The extended hind leg reaches to the humerus. JIemoral pores 6-8, in a rosette.
Measurements.—Total length, 112 mm.; length to vent, 73 mm.; length to gular fold, 14 mm.; length of fore leg, 35 mm.; length of fore foot, 11.5 mm.; length of hind leg, 46 mm.; length of hind foot, 20 mm.; length of head to interoccipital border, 17 mm.; length of occipital horn, 7 mm.; length of internal temporal horn, 4 mm.; width of head (greatest), 2 mm.; width of head between superciliary angles, 13 mm.; width of body at middle, 38 mm.
Color above ashen, with blackish crossbars, which are well defined posteriorly only, and which are interrupted on the middle line, except on the tail, where they are continuous. Each half of the two dorsal bars presents a chevron forward. Those crossing at the groin and posterior to the vent are undulating. A large blackish spot on each side of the neck; head unspotted; humerus, elbow, and forearm each with a faint spot; femur and tibia each with a more distinet blackish crossbar. Inferior surfaces cream-colored, except a few small black spots on the posterior face of the femur and base of the tail and some fainter ones on the posterior part of the abdomen.

This species is pearest to the A. platyrhina Girard, from which it differs in various respects. The general proportions of all the parts and the coloration are about as in that species, the difference chietly appearing in the squamation and the horns. The scales of the head are much more subdivided, and the presence of accessory horns is unique in the genus. The simplicity of the lateral fringe is also characteristic, as is also the rudimental character of the rosette on the neck.

Phrynosoma goodei STEJNEGER, North American Fauna, No. 7, Pt. 2, 1893, p. 191, pl. 1, fig. 3.
Although larger than the A. modesta, this is one of the smaller spe. — cies. The horns are well developed, and the temporal region is expanded and produced on each side, resembling in this respect the A. maccallii. Three temporal plates especially prominent, the last developed into a horn which equals the occipital in length. Like the — occipitals they are divergent, and not parallel, as is the case in A. modesta. Posterior superciliary angle prominent, but not produced. Three last infralabials prominently angulate, the last produced, and

not followed by a spine. On the side of the neck two longitudinal folds, one above the other, each supporting a row of spinous scales. Muzzle concavely truncate, descending steeply from a transverse interpreorbital angle. Scales of top of head rugose. Supraorbitals partly or quite separated by a single row of scales; anterior and posterior superciliaries in contact. Gulars subequal.
Dorsal scales unequal, the lateral smallest, the largest median keeled. Five or six rows of distant scales much larger than the rest on each side of the median line, their apices moderately prominent. The scales of the single row forming the lateral fringe are very prominent and acute, Scales of inferior surfaces smooth, except those of the tibia and feet, which are keeled; those of the belly about equal to those of

the middle of the back. Tail with a lateral fringe of pointed scales like those of the sides; the pholidosis of the superior surface irregular but without spines.
The extended hind limb reaches nearly to the posterior border of the orbit. The fifth toe equals or is shorter than the first. Femoral pores 8-10, not extended across the belly. Tail tapering, depressed throughout, 2.5 times as long as head to base of occipital horns.
Measurements (Cat. No. 8567).—Total length, 115 mm.; length to vent, 72 mm.; length to gular fold, 18 mm.; length to end of occipital horn, 20 mm.; length to base of occipital horn, 16 mm.; width at temporal horns, 22 mmn.; length of fore leg, 36 mm.; length of fore foot, 12 mm.; length of hind leg, 47 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm.
In aleohol this species is gray above and white below. A blackish spot on each side of the nape, and three pairs of blackish spots about the bases of the large scales on the dorsal region. On each side of these the large scales have a blackish shade at the base, forming a chain-like row of spots parallel with the convex lateral outline. Tail with dusky cross lines above. Inferior surfaces immaculate.
But two specimens of this species are known, and these, in accordance with their desert habitat, are of pallid colors. Itis related most nearly to the A. maccallii, and may be distinguished by the absence of the large row of lateral gular scales, the more expanded temporal region, the relatively shorter horns, and the generally more slender proportions.

In life the ground color of the dorsal region is a pinkish gray or grayish cream color, and this is marked with blackish, as follows: A large spot on each side of the nape, which may or may not be fused near the occiput, aud which do not reach the humeri. [rom three to five chevrons directed posteriorly along the lines of the larger scales, well defined posteriorly only, and with the external extremities turned backward. These marks may become obsolete on the posterior part of the back, especially in old animals. Limbs distantly, tail rather closely, cross banded with dusky. Inferior surfaces immaculate cream color, with sometimes a few dusky specks posteriorly and on the femora. The head above yellowish or reddish brown and without color marks.
There is sometimes a shallow fissure in the scaling in the position of the tympanic membrane in this species, but I have never seen that membrane exposed in even a rudimentary manner. This may, however, rarely be the case, but no specimen has been seen, so far as I am aware, with a distinct tympanic disk.
This is the Great basin horned lizard, and is not found outside of its limits. It ranges from southeastern California to northern Nevada and southern Idaho. From the latter State Dr. J. L. Wortman sent mea specimen from the Bruneau River. I found it abundant near Pyramid Lake, Nevada, and at the west foot of the San Francisco Mountains, in southwestern Utah. Its colors are the most pleasing in the genus.
The stomach of an individual from northwestern Nevada was filled with bodies and fragments of the large red ant which abounds in that region, which Dr. McCook identifies as the Pogonomyrmesx occidentalis. Besides these there was a grasshopper, a Pentatoma-like hemipter, a small beetle, and several insect larvee. The ant is evidently its principal food, and there is no scarcity of them in that arid region. Their sting is very severe, and the Anota must be proof against it to a degree much superior to that possessed by the (to him) gigantic mammal, man.
Dr. Stejneger remarks of this species as observed by the Death Valley exploring expedition:
Anota platyrhina inhabits the Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great Basin from California to Utah and ranges up a short distance into the Upper Sonoran. In California it was found in greater or less abundance in the Mohave Desert, in Owens, Coso, Panamint, Death, Mesquite, and Deep Spring valleys, and in the Argus, Funeral, and Panamint mountains (up to 1,740 meters or 5,700 feet on west slope northwest of Wild Rose Spring). In Nevada it was abundant in Sarcobatus Flat, the Amargosa Desert, Ash Meadows, Indian Spring, Pahrump, Vegas, Pahranagat, and Meadow Creek valleys, and the valley of the Virgin and Muddy. In the northwestern corner of Arizona it was very abundant about the mouth of Beaverdam Creek and thence up on the west slope of the Beaverdam Mountains. In Utah it was common in the Santa Clara Valley ranging up through the sage brush to Diamond Valley and Mountain Meadows.
At Ash Meadows in the Amargosa Desert a very white form was found living on the white alkali soil.

ANOTA MACCALLIT HALLOWELL. Desert of Gila and Colorado. Cat. No. 162, U.S.N.M.
Of this rare species, since the discovery of the type, the U. 8. National — Museum has received a male, a female, and a young one from the Colorado Desert of southeastern California. It is a very distinet species and is so far known from a limited range only. | [ie
There are two lateral series of spiniform scales, of which the inferior
is shorter at both extremities than the superior, the latter extending
about three-quarters the length from the axilla to the groin. The

<<<Page: 474>>>

enlarged lateral gular scales are not very conspicuous, and form a short series. Theoccipital horns are long andacute. Theinternal temporals are half as long, and the external temporals are as long as the internal. They are directed nearly transversely, while the internal temporals are directed at an angle of 45°, and the occipitals more nearly posteriorly. The tail is broad and flat, and is bordered on each side by a fringe of rather closely placed spinous scales. Femoral pores numerous, in undivided scales. No accessory horns. Nares anterior.
The infralabial scales have anteriorly prominent angles, and are produced into short horns posteriorly. The scales of the head are larger than in most other species, and they are obscurely rugose to nearly smooth. There are five scales in a transverse row between the canthals on the anterior frontal angle. Of these the laterals are quite small, and the median three larger than in any other species, especially those on each side of the median. Supraoculars from two and three in a crossrow behind to four in front. Posterior superciliary angle not much produced, the penultimate superciliary scale not prominent nor even angular. Middle parietal region convex and not separated from the temporal region by arn angle. Superior labials nine and ten to below the middle of the eye, forming a serrate border except anteriorly. In the temporal series of scales the one adjacent to the external temporal horn is very prominent, and the two anterior to it have apical angles.
The lateral cervical scales which are in line with the enlarged gulars (at a considerable distance) are only two or three in number, instead of forming the usual series, while the lateral cervical rosette above them is represented by a series of five or six large scales with basals. The ground scales of the back are flat, smooth, of various sizes, and generally broader than long. The enlarged scales are broader than long, keeled, and, except to a limited extent in one row, not free posteriorly. There is a row of the smaller of the keeled scales on each side of the middle line, which is quite regular. The largest scales form a widely spaced row just external to these. The other keeled scales diminish in size externally, and they do not form regular rows. They become more conic externally. Humerus and forearm covered with large keeled seales with free apices, except inferiorly. Seales of femur and tibia keeled and of diverse sizes, except on the concealed surfaces, where they are smaller, though generally similar. Seales of inferior surfaces smooth, except on the thorax, where they are faintly keeled and graduate into those of the humerus.
Extended hind leg reaching the axillain female, or to the front of the humerus in male. Femoral pores 21-21 in the male, 18-17 in the female, in undivided scales. In the male there are 3-3 additional pores on an adjacent row of scales. Lateral seales of the toes produced, most on the external sides.
Measurements (Cat. No. 15955, male).—Total length, 108 mm,; length

to vent, 70 mm.; length to gular fold, 14.5 mm.; length of fore leg, 27 mm.; length of fore foot, 10 mm.; length of hind leg, 45 mm.; leng L of hind foot, 16.5 mm. lgneeh of head to interoccipital border, 16 mm.; 5 length of pee pial foe 7 mm.; iene of internal temporal horn, 5. a mm.; width of head (greatest), 25mm.; width of head between supaa ciliary angles, 12 mm.; width of body ie middle, 51 mm.
The color above is light ashen, in the male with an orange tinge, which was no doubt much more distances in the living than in the alvoholic specimen. A narrow median brown line extends from the parietal foramen to the rump. On each side of this are two rows of round — brown spots or ocelli, as they have a pale interior and a brown central dot. These form three transverse rows, the anterior behind the axilla and the posterior just anterior to the groin. The four longitudinal series are continued on the tail, where they are arranged transversely, Horns pale in the female, orange in the male. Head unspotted; limbs. with obscure cross bands; inferior surfaces unspotted, except a short black line at the position of the omphalomeseraic fissure. The colon tion is peculiar in the absence of the lateral cervical spots. There is no trace in the female, and a faint longitudinal shade well posterior to the head only in.the male.
This peculiar species inhabits the Colorado Desert; it presents the usual character of desert species in its well-developed cranial spines. The scales, on the other hand, do not display this character, as they are less spinous than those of any other species, either of this genus or of Phrynosoma. .

tylus, but it is present and free in Hublepharis. In Sphwrodactylus
notatus I observed the exceptional character of a distinct digitiform
lobe of the liver on the left side, which partly embraces the stomach. There are two families of this superfamily.
Vertebrie procelous; parietal bones united .......--.------.-----EUBLEPHARID 2, Vertebrie amphicelous; parietal bones separate ....-----------------GEKCONID A.
These families are found in the warmer regions of both continents. The species which they include are of insectivorous habits. I have been able to examine the mesenteries in relatively few genera of the superfamily. I find the structure to be of the type most frequent in the Sauria; that is, a single hepatoventral; a single gastrohepatic; a left gastropulmonary, and a right hepatic, which embraces the right lung.
This superfamily is most nearly allied to the Diploglossa in its produced petrosal and papillose tongue. The form of the petrosal is very different, and the underarched frontals are very rare in that group, while the expanded clavicles are like those of the Leptoglossa in general.

Coronoid bone produced anteriorly and posteriorly on external side of ramus. Surangular wanting. Angular largely developed exteriorly, not interiorly. Splenial elongate; Meckel’s cartilage covered between the splenial and internal mental foramina. Premaxillary broad, in contact with vomer. Pterygoids not touching sphenoid. Frontal arching under olfactory lobes. Parietal bones distinct; attachment of occipital segment very open; gomphosis internal. Petrosal with anterior vertico-oblique ring; superior plate produced beyond anterior semicircular canal, forming abutment for columella. Postorbital osseous bars incomplete. Tongue papillose, no part retractile.
I have examined the hemipenis in the genera Thecadactylus, Platydactylus, Phyllodactylus, and Gymnodactylus. In these this organ is short and wide, appropriately to the fragility of the tail ata point just beyond the base. It is also more or less deeply divided into two branches. The entire surface is calyculate, generally minutely. In Thecadactylus each fork has three strong welts. In Platydactylus there is a welt opposite the sulcus, which is very large in P. egyptiacus, and divides,

<<<Page: 477>>>

sending a half intoeach branch. InGymnodactylus pulchellus the welts are not so heavy; below the bifurcation is a welt which incloses a circular area, which is incomplete proximad.
Boulenger gives the following interesting general account of this family :
The skull is generally much depressed, and its bones are thin. The nasals remain distinct; the frontal is either single or with distinct suture; the jugal is rudimentary, the orbit not being bound posteriorly by a bony arch; the supratemporal arch is likewise absent; the pterygoids are widely separated and devoid of teeth, and columella cranii is present. The mandible contains only five bones, the angular and articular being coalesced; the dentition belongs to the pleurodont type; the teeth are small, numerous, closely set, with long, slender, cylindrical shaft and obtuse point; the new teeth hollow out the base of the old ones. Only in a few instances does the derm of the head coalesce with the skull, and a supraorbital bone is present only in a few species of Tarentola. Both pairs of limbs are constantly well developed and pentadactyle. The clavicle is dilated and perforated proxi-~ mally, and the interclavicle is subrhomboidal, or of a shape intermediate between that and the cruciform. The vertebrie are bicencave; the ribs are long, and so prolonged as to form more or less ossified hoops across the whole of the abdominal region.
The digits vary considerably, and afford excellent characters for systematic arrangement. Some Geckos (living in barren regions) have the digits similar to those of many Agamoids, i.e., they are subcylindrical or feebly depressed, and frequently keeled inferiorly or denticulated laterally ; other forms with nondilated digits have them angularly bent at the articulations and provided with strong claws; but the greater number have the whole or part of the digits dilated into adhesive organs with symmetrical plates or lamellie inferiorly, the arrangement of which varies considerably. Then, also, the claw may be retractile, either between some of the lamelle or into a special sheath. Membranes may unite the digits, but the web serves only for the purpose of obtaining a greater adhesive surface, and never for Swimning, none of the Geckos entering the water.
The body is generally more or less depressed, and may be bordered by cutaneous expansions, the object of which appears to be, in most cases, the same as that of the interdigital membrane; but in the curious genus Ptychozoon, in which the lateral membranes attain the greatest development, they act as a parachute. The tail presents almost every possible shape from the leaf-like tail of Gymnodactylus platurus and the grotesque rudimentary tail of Nephrurus to the slender, rat-like tail of Agamura and the compressed crested tail of Pristurus. This organ is, except in Agamura, extremely fragile and rapidly reproduced, in which case, however, it generally assumes an abnormal shape and lepidosis. In some forms the tail proves to be prehensile, a faculty which is possessed by few lizards other than the Chameleons; and Tam induced to believe that a careful examination of the Geckos, when alive, will show this character to be not unfrequent.
The eye is generally large and with vertical pupil, which, when contracted strongly, is frequently denticulated or assumes the shape of two superposed rhombs; some diurnal forms have the eye smaller and the pupil circular. The eye is exposed as in snakes, covered by a transparent lid under which it moves freely, the valvular lids being rudimentary; in lurosaurus, however, there are connivent movable lids, and in Ptenopus the upper lid is sufficiently developed to cover the eye nearly completely.
The tympanum is more or less exposed, except in Teratolepis, in which genus it appears to be completely concealed under the scales. The tongue is fleshy, moderately elongate, very feebly incised anteriorly, and capable of protrusion out of the mouth,

<<<Page: 478>>>

The teguments are nearly always soft and consist generally of granules or tubercules on the dorsai surface, of small imbricated cycluid or hexagonal scales on the ventralsurtace. Some Geckos are entirely covered with scales of the latter description, which attain their highest development in Teratoscincus, Teratolepis, and Geckolepis.
The habits of the Geckos are highly interesting and deserve special attention, as but few observations have been made on them. Some inhabit arid regions, sometimes burrowing in the sand; others are arboreal, living on shrubs or in woods, concealing themselves under stones or under the bark of trees during the daytime; others live on rocks; others have become the commensals of man, and they again may be divided into two groups—those living inside, those living outside houses. Most are nocturnal, but some are diurnal. Colonel Tytler, in a very interesting paper on the habits of Geckos, observes that, ‘‘although several species of Geckos may inhabit the same locality, yet, as a general rule, they keep separate and aloof from each other; for instance, in a house the dark cellars may be the resort of one species, the roof of another, and crevices in a wall may be exclusively occupied by a third species. However, at night they issue forth in quest of insects, and may be found mixed up together in the same spot; but on the slightest disturbance, or when they have done feeding, they return hurriedly to their particular hiding places.”
Many Geckos utter sounds, probably produced chiefly by a movement of the tongue against the palate, and in which yecko, chucko, tockee, or something similar is distinctly audible. A. Smith says that a South-African sand Gecko (Ptenopus garrulus) utters during the day a sharp sound somewhat like chick, chick; and he adds that the number thus occupied is at times so great, and the noise so disagreeable, as to cause the traveler to change his quarters.
The eggs are round and with a hard shell. Ovoviviparism has not been observed in this family. Males are generally distinguished from females by a larger size, the swelling of the base of the tail, and the presence of femoral or prieanal pores, which are constantly absent in the latter.
The Geckonidx are represented in the hotter parts of all the regions of the world. They are most numerous in the Indian and Australian regions.

The two genera which belong to our fauna may be very easily distinguished by the following characters:
Phyllodactylus.—Digits all terminated by triangular pallets or disks, with a longitudinal median groove beneath; claws exposed.
Spherodactylus.—Digits all terminated by cireular disks, without central groove, and ensheathing the claws.
Both of these genera enter the Nearetic Realm at the borders only, the Phyllodactylus on the southwest and the Spherodactylus on the southeast, the former from the Mexican district and the latter from the West Indian district of the Neotropical Realm.

Digits all dilated at their extremity into a disk, which is perfectly smooth beneath, with a median furrow, all provided with distinct claws.
The phylodactyles are easily known by the smoothness below of their digital disks and the distinct claws. Other characters, according to Duméril and Bibron, are the vertical pupil, the nostrils flared at the extremity of the snout, no second range of plates bordering the lower labials; the digits with transverse divisions beneath, posterior to the dilated portion.
Osteology.—In_ their osteology the species of this genus conform strictly to the Geckonid type as already described. I have before me the skeleton of P. tuberculosus, from which the following description is derived: The premaxillary is single and has a long superior spine; inferiorly it has the posterior border emarginate. Nasals elongate, distinct, emarginate posteriorly for the frontal. IJ‘rontal single, rather narrow, completely underarching olfactory lobes. Parietals distinct, wide, without pineal foramen, lying rather closely on supraoccipital, sending backward the parietoquadrate arch, which incloses a small foramen with the exoccipital. Supraoccipital distinguished from exoecipital by suture. Prefrontal narrow, forming the preorbital border to the middle above; no lachrymal; jugal represeited by a splint which extends from the prefrontal to the extremity of the maxillary on the superior surface of the latter. Postfrontal a rather wide V-shaped bone, its longest limb extending posteriorly more than halfway to the base of the parietoquadrate arch. No postorbital. Quadrate with a single large, concave, external conch. Paroccipital in the usual position, splint-like.
Vomers in close contact throughout, with a common convex posterior border; an external longitudinal convexity of the inferior surface, and a groove on each side of the median suture, which divides a keel. Palatines short and wide, and with a longer vomerine than maxillary proeess, and curving downward below the level of the vomers. Narial orifices fissure-like except posteriorly and anteriorly, the external border with a dentate process of the maxillary bone directed posteriorly near the middle. Pterygoids much expanded anteriorly, forming with the ectopterygoids and palatines a thin plate, which closes up the palatine foramen; contracting rather rapidly posteriorly to the subcylindric rod

<<<Page: 482>>>

like portion. Epipterygoid extending from the pterygoid at the basipterygoid process, and resting on the apex of the petrosal. Latter produced above anterior to semicircular canal; the anterior border continued into acrest which runs posteriorly above the trigeminal foramen. This terminates at the down-looking crest of the subforaminal portion, which bounds externally a wide down-looking groove. Basipterygoid processes long. Sphenoid distinct from basioceipital. Occipital condyle subequally divided into three parts, two prominent exoccipitals and a contracted basioccipital. The result is an apparently double condyle.
Mandible with the Meckelian groove closed, and with the splenial small and but little produced beyond the splenial foramen. Coronoid produced a little horizontally at the base. Angular not distinct; surangular and articular distinct. Angle simple, direct, spoon-shaped, with superior concavity. I have observed the following peculiarities in the otic and hyoid regions. There is no infrastapedial cartilage, and the suprastapedial and epistapedial cartilages are continuous. The hyoid system is characterized by the fact that the ceratohyal is attached to the paroccipital, which carries a cartilage on its extremity. There is a short second ceratobranchial, and no free epibranchial.
Vertebre amphicelous. Intercentra present throughout the vertebral column, continued into chevrons on the caudal region. Cervical ribs widened and truncate at extremities. In the specimen described the diapophyses of the second sacral vertebra are deeply longitudinally grooved on the inferior side so as to be nearly split. Diapophyses of anterior caudals elongate. Neural spines distinct but low throughout the column. In the scapular arch I note the following peculiarities. There is no prosecapula, and the clavicle is much enlarged, and is perforate at the median extremity. The interclavicle is cruciform, with the angles filled up so as to have coneave borders. It is coossified with the clavicle in P. tuberculatus, and extends but a little way posteriorly on the sternum. The coracoid has one large foramen. The sternum has no fontanelle. There are four hemapophyses attached to the sternum on each side; and two to each of the slender closely approximated xiphoid rods. There are several very slender abdominal ribs.
The ilium has no angulus criste, and the acetabulum is entire. The pubes join at alittle less than a right angle, and the pectineal processes are short and a little posterior to the middle. Pubes uniting at less than aright angle below, with the tuberosities distal.
The most distinctive feature of the skeleton of this genus is the presence of intercentra throughout the vertebral column, a point in which it resembles the extinct Theromora of the Permian epoch.

The nostril is situated in the middle of one plate with a narrow rim, which is encircled by five others, instead of being a mere pit between in the angle of four plates, one of them the first labial. The scales are much finer on the back and coarser on the belly. The limbs are shorter. The central line of scales beneath the toes is wider and less angular. The hook on the side of the base of the tail is represented in the type by numerous smaller scales. Above, light brownish or reddish yellow, with a series of transverse blotches of darker on each side (about eight or ten). <A few seen on the tail. Beneath, uniform whitish.
Head and body much depressed; the neck somewhat contracted. The ears are small and crescentic. The eyes are very large; the eyelids annular and apparently not capable of covering the eye. The bony ring of the sclerotica is composed of many plates, asin birds. The nostrils are small, very far forward, and situated so close to the low rostral as to appear partly excavated in it. They are placed just above the junction of the rostral and first labial, with ten plates between them and touching the rostral. Behind them and against these internasals is another plate, smaller than the latter; another tubercular plate still smaller and like the others behind it completes the border. The head is injured so that the labial plates can not be readily distinguished, but there are apparently eight or nine upper, the posterior becoming smaller Fig. 83. and four or five lower, becoming PHYLLODACTYLUS TUBERCULOSUS WIEGMANN,. smaller behind and then changing to BE a double series of tubercles. The at decors tees Spa: end of the lower jaw is formed by a large, long plate, acutely angular behind, with a large subpentagonal are between it and the first labial. Behind this the plates become subhexagonal and diminish gradually in size to the general average, occupying a patch extending as far as opposite the fourth lower labial and bordered behind and laterally by small plates. ‘Those bordering the lower labials are not much larger than those on the back part of the chin, similar ones covering the upper part of the head, as far as to the posterior borders of the orbit. The rest of the head above, the back and sides, with the throat, are covered with small, approximated granules, with much larger conical or trihedral ones interspersed. Of these the back exhibits about ten regular series, five large ones on each side of the median line, with an additional row of smaller ones on each flank. The belly is completely and regularly covered with smooth subhexagonal scales arranged in quincunx, although but little imbricated. Of

these there are about 31 or 32 in an oblique series across the belly. They extend from the throat to the tail and quite similar ones are to be seen on the entire inferior surface of the hind legs and the anterior of the front legs; the latter more convex.
The upper surfaces of the legs are like the back, but the tubercles are less regular. The posterior face of the arm aaa femur over the sides, except above, are covered with uniform small seales, those on the femur being abruptly smaller behind than inferiorly.
The legs are short, the hinder especially. The digits are all nearly equal, increasing in length from the first to the third, which is about equal to the fourth and fifth. They are connected at the base by a web. They are depressed, their under surface with a series of short, transverse, rather tubercular lamelle, and they terminate in a flattened obcordate or subquadrate expansion, which is perfectly smooth and flat beneath, witha central longitudinal groove, and emarginate or cordate at the end, to receive the point of the sharp, apparently retractile, claw.
The tail is cylindrical, thickened, but attenuated at the end, and not quite as long as the head and body; it is contracted at the base and covered pretty regularly with small scales in indistinct whorls, and about as large as those on the belly. The under surface, however, is occupied by a series of broad transverse plates, beginning a short distance behind the anus. On the upper surface, too, are four rows of the large tubercles, continued from the arch, on as many slight ridges, separated by furrows, the central of which is the largest. The tubercles of each series are separated by an interval of about three of the smaller scales. On each side the base of the tail and above the anus is an oblique series of three spinous tubercles. There are two exposed cavities behind the anus (containing the penes?), but there are no femoral or preanal pores.
This specimen sufficiently resembles the species described by Wiegmann to belong to it, except that the ventral scales are smooth, not carinated, and uniform, not mixed with smaller ones.

Seales rounded, flat; in about 36 rows on the dorsal region; those of the muzzle smaller than dorsal, little Jarger than those of the occiput. Internasals in contact. Seven superior labials, including that under the pupil; six inferior, to the same point, the last two very small, the first larger than the second, extensively in contact with the first pair of mental plates, which bound the symphyseal posteriorly. Each of the former is bounded by three smaller, and these are succeeded by a few rows which diminish in size. Terminal disks with straight outlines. Tail without tubercles. Anal scales similar to the abdominal. Auricular opening as long as pupil. Premaxillary teeth five. Above gray, shining, with five broad, blackish, centrally pale cross bands, from base of tail to interscapular region; a dark band from the muzzle through the eye, a cross band on occiput, and various irregular spots on the top of head and labial regions.

Mr. Van Denuburgh,! of San Francisco, who has seen more specimens of this species than any other person, thus writes of the variations in its coloration:
There is great variation in the coloration of the head and back. In some specimens it is pale gray or creamy white, while in others the prevailing tint isa dark seal-brown. There are, however, some fairly constant markings brighter in young than in old individuals, but appar-
ently subject like the ground color, though Fig. 84.

than the ground color of the darkest indi-
viduals. A line originates on the second labial plate and, passing through the eye and the upper ear-opening, runs for some distance along the neck. The uppersurface of the head is blotched and spotted, as are also the limbs. The tail has about nine crossbars on its upper surface. All the lower surfaces are creamy white, slightly tinged with brown in the darkest specimens. ‘The scales are everywhere minutely punctulated over with dark brown.

Digits subcylindrical, without claws; expanded at their extremity into subcircular pads; smooth, and not grooved beneath.
The Spherodactyles are easily distinguished from the Phyllodactyles by the absence of any median groove on the surface of the terminal disks of the digits. They differ in other points of organization, though more nearly related to them than to the other Geckonide. ;
The species described by Duméril and Bibron all appear to have the scales of the dorsal surface small, granular, or else with those along the middle of back smaller than the layer on either side. The single one inhabiting the United States (Key West), on the contrary, has the scales of the upper surface large, equal, strongly carinated, and larger than the ventral. The S. richardsonii of Gray has the same character, but differs in coloration.

Tail cylindrical. The head is about half the body alone; the tail equal to both together. The hind leg is contained about two and two-thirds times in head and body; the hind foot about 6 times. ‘Che upper parts are light-brownish yellow, covered rather distantly, but quite uniformly, with small circular spots of reddish brown, conspicuously so on the whole head; scarcely seen on the belly; on the breast they almost seem arranged in regular lines. Head broad and acutely pointed, depressed; width about twothirds the length to ear. Rostral consisting of a large triangular plate forming the entire end of the muzzle. The nostril opening in its posterior margin over the junction of the first labial, bordered above by aslight shell. Behind the rostral are two triangular plates meeting internally by an acute angle, and coming by the antero-exterior angle in contact with the lateral rostral. There are three large upper labials, the first largest, the second between this and the third; posteriorly are two or three much smaller. There is a very large mental plate like the rostral, and forming the end of the jaw; on each side of this is one very large lower labial corresponding to the first and second upper; — then two smaller ones. There are no plates under the lower labials larger than those on the chin. There is a shallow depression in the —

hinder part of the rostral, divided longitudinally by a shallow groove, and possibly indicating a fusion with an internasal or nasal plate. The eyes are very large and much exposed; the eyelids appear to. be annular, the lower entering completely within the orbital cavity. The ears are very small and circular.
The head and upper part of neck, except as described, are covered with uniform tubercles, which become a little larger anteriorly. The upper parts and sides of body are covered with quite large, imbricated, acute, angular, and strongly carinated scales, of which there appear to be about thirty across back and sides. On the belly the scales are a little smaller, hexagonal, and smooth—about twenty in an oblique series. About fifteenridges may be counted above between the hind legs. The scales in front of the pubes are coarser, thicker, and more tubercular than more anteriorly.

fore leg and of thigh are small, even, and granular, like those back of the head. The upper and outer surfaces of the legs are covered with large, acute, carinated scales. The tail is cylindrical, as long as body (alive), constricted at base, and finely whorled, the scales in under surface broader. There are no pores about the anus nor spines at the base of tail, as far as can be perceived. The legs are short, the digits broad, depressed, and without any claws, each one expanded at the end into a plain circular subhemispherical depressed pad, plane on the under surface; the digits anterior to this transversely lamellated.
This species in its large and strongly carinated scales, about of equal size, differs widely from all those described by Duméril and Bibron, but approaches the S. richardsonii of Gray.’ The colors, however, are entirely different.
Specimens from Cuba collected by Charles Wright are very similar in character generally, but appear to have a more slender head and

more obtuse muzzle, with larger plates above it. The coloration is the same in some, but in others the head. There is adusky line along the top of head, and three from behind the eye, a middle one, broadest, passing above the ear, an inferior passing below it, and a short one above the rest. The line on top of the head bifurcates at the occiput | and with the others is continued indistinctly along the body. There is also a line from nose to eye.

Geckonide, part, of most authors. Eublepharide BOULENGER, part Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), XII, 1883, p. 308; (5), XIV, 1884, p. 119.
Except in the procoelian vertebre and the single parietal bone, the skeleton is similar to that of the preceding family, to which the Eublepharide areaffined. The teguments are also very similar, and of a soft kind, the upper surfaces are covered with small scales or granules, which are usually intermixed with enlarged tubercles, and the lower surface of the body with small cycloid imbricated scales. The skin of the head is free from the skull. The eyes are moderately large, with elliptico-vertical pupil, and are protected by thick, movable, connivent lids. The nostril is rather large, directed slightly upward, though lateral, and separated from the rostral and labial plates. The tympanum is exposed. The limbs are weak and the digits short and cylindrical; they are all provided with a small, sharp, retractile claw which, in Coleonyz, is entirely concealed inamuch-developed, compressed Sheath; this sheath, which differs only in size according to the genera, is composed of two lateral plates, the superior suture of which is coyered by a third narrower one, a structure which we have already met with in the Geckoid genus Mlurosaurus. As in the Geckos, the tail is extremely fragile. Males have preanal pores, forming an angular series.
Three species are natives of Central America, one of the southern parts of the United States, two of southern Asia, and one of West Africa; the genus Hublepharis occurs in America as well as in Asia. This extraordinary distribution seems to indicate that the few representatives of this small family are the remnants of some ancient, more generally dispersed group; it nevertheless remains a matter of wonder how forms now so widely separated have retained so great a resem-
blance, not only in structure but also in the pattern of coloration. (Boulenger.)

A short spine at each side of the base of the tail. Tail cylindrical all round, with very short whorls of small square plates constricted at base. Digits conical, not dilated; denticulated along the edges beneath with two or three series of transverse tubercles, the central largest and
lamellar. Claws very small, not retractile, paneeale concealed by two

Dr. Boulenger! distinguishes the HF. elegans Gray, of Mexico and Central America, as the type of a distinct genus Coleonyx, following Gray, on the ground that the claws are completely concealed in the latter. I find the characters of the EH. elegans and the FE. variegatus to be identical in this respect, and so can not separate them generically.
Anatomy.—Owing to the isolated position of this genus, its osteology is worthy of especial attention. The premaxillary is undivided, and has a long superior spine, but no inferior spine. The nasals are distinct. The frontals are coossified, and the interorbital space is very narrow. The parietals are coossified, and there is no pineal foramen. The Supraoccipital is loosely articulated anteriorly, but is coossified with the exoccipitals. Nolachrymal bone; prefrontal large, but not reaching far posteriorly over orbit. Postfrontal small, crescentic; no postorbital. No pee oraats or supratemporal arches. Bee tate arch ade

pressed; paroccipital lying over the parietal at the inferior extremity. No jugal bone. No orbitosphenoid; the olfactory lobes inclosed below by the frontal bone. Petrosal produced beyond semicircular canal at the superior anterior angle, and without the oblique crest such as is char| acteristic of the Geckonid. A subforaminal projection and groove, the external wall of the groove as prominent downward as the internal, so that the groove is open inferiorly. Vomers swollen, separated for most of their length by a deep groove. Palatines short and wide, sending a postnarial process to the maxillary. Pterygoids broad and flat in front, narrower posteriorly, with a short ectopterygoid withoct descending angle, inclosing a maxillopalatine foramen. Basipterygoids elongate. Sphenoid and basioccipital distinct; the latter distinct also from exoccipitals. Occipital condyle convex, without exoccipital portion. Epipterygoid oblique, articulating below posterior to ectopterygoid process of pterygoid and above with petrosal only. Quadrate straight, oblique, with a single conch, which is external to the rod-like axis; condyle emarginate. In the mandible the angular bone is small but distinct, and the coronoid is produced much farther anteriorly than posteriorly on the external face of the ramus. The dentary extends to about opposite the middle of the coronoid on the external face of the ramus. The splenial extends posteriorly but not anteriorly. The Meckelian groove closed. In the hyoid apparatus all the elements are present, including a pair of elongate second ceratobranchials. There is a free process of the ceratohyal anterior to its junction with the hypohyal.
The scapular arch is much like that of the Geckonide. The clavicle is expanded and perforate proximally. The interclavicle is suberuciform, with the limbs connected by laminate expansion. There is a small proscapula which is connected at its apex with the epicoracoid. Coracoid with one large emargination. Sternum without fontanelle, supporting three ribs and a xiphoid rod, which supports but one rib. No abdominal ribs.
The hemipenis is closely similar to that of the Geckonidie. It is short and deeply bifurcate. It has a single prominent welt. The surface of this is smooth, but the remainder of the surface is calyculate.

rostrum with a few brown blotches. Edges of eyelids and whole under surfaces opaque white.
Body everywhere (except on the belly) covered with perfectly uniform, excessively minute, rounded tubercles or granular scales, much too small to be appreciable by the naked eye; they are, however, rather smaller on the head all round. The lateral granules change gradually on the belly to rhombic, imbricated, carinated scales, arranged regularly in quincunx and becoming a little larger to the center. They begin on the lower part of the throat and cover the under surface of the hind legs: they are a little larger than elsewhere between the insertion of the hind legs. The tail is occupied by a succession of short whorls of nearly equal square scales as large as those on the belly, the inferior ones largest. The ear opens abruptly as an oval deep cavity. There are no palatine teeth. The only plates on the head consist of those margining the jaws, consisting of a large, nearly equal rostral and mental and about 9 labials (upper and lower each), the posterior smaller. These are margined by scales rather larger than the average of those on the head. The annular nostril is in the center of a small plate with narrow edges, placed above the

square plates, and anteriorly by a long, narrow one applied against the rostral. The orbits are large, the eyelids very full, continuous, and uniform with the supraand infra-orbital region. Each has a Series of narrow quadrate plates on its edge.
The toes have no lateral pallets, but are conical, tapering to the claws, although depressed and slightly denticulated laterally. Beneath they are covered with transverse tubercles arranged in two or three longitudinal series, the central widest. The claws are very small, quite straight, slender, and apparently not retractile; they are scarcely visible in a sheath of scales. The fingers are long and nearly equal, the first and fifth reaching opposite the same point—the penultimate articulation of the third. The fourth toe is longest; the third and second successively shorter by about a claw; the fifth about equal to the first and much shorter than second, The hind foot is about as long

as the tibia. On each side of the base of the tail is a short depressed spine curved a little upward and forward like a spur; and just behind the anus, but exterior to it, and almost covered by the anal flap, are two quite large ones, frilled with a membranous substance.
A second series of specimens (Cat. No. 3213), probably the males of the preceding, from Camp Yuma, differs from that just described in haying a series of well-defined preanal pores in the centers of six or seven large circular scales between the centers of insertion of hind legs. The pits behind the anus appear filled with erectile tissue, probably the penis, as the space behind is much swollen or subglobular, with a median longitudinal depression and a deep constriction behind it, beyond which the tail with the larger scales begins at a distance of about twenty one-hundredths of an inch from the anus. This is very different from the majority of lizards where the tail comes close up to the anal slit.
It may be that the specimens with preanal pores (Cat. No. 3213) are really of a different species from the typical ones without them. The central row of tubercles beneath the toes is wider and more transversely lamellar than in the type specimen.
The head is large and broad; convex above and ovate; the width about two-thirds the length. It is contained (from snout to ear) a little more than four times in head and body. The hind legs extended forward twice; reach nearly to the eye, and are contained about two and one-half times in head and body. The hind foot alone is contained six times in head and body.
The color in Cat. No. 3217 is a light brownish yellow above, with small rounded reddish-brown blotches irregularly distributed. The edges of the eyelids, the nostrils, the tip of rostral, a spot in front of the orbital region, and ten spots on each side of upper jaw are white; the rest of upper labials and tip of rostrum reddish brown, like the dorsal blotches. The under parts are opaque silvery white.
In another series which appears identical with the preceding, though of smaller size, the ground color is brownish yellow, but the back is crossed by six or seven broad bars of olivaceous brown, about equal to each other and to their interspaces. These are continued on the tail as five or six rings interrupted below, the borders considerably darker than the centers. The most anterior bar covers the whole head behind the eye. The anterior portion of the head likewise is quite similar, with a U-shaped light mark above the anterior corner of the eye (the | concavity anterior), a square spot in the rostral and one around and behind the nostril. The labials are yellowish, with a dusky spot on the end of the lower jaw and another crossing both jaws at about the fourth and fifth labials. The chin is slightly blotched.

It is found in
holes under stones toward evening, and generally in pairs—a peculiarity I have not observed in any other lizard. Its manners are also peculiar. It carries its thick tail coiled vertically on one side of its back, like the spitz dog. Its movements are quick but feeble, and its short legs for-
bid the speed of other lizards.

Geckonide, part of most authors. Uroplatide BOULENGER, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), XIV, 1884, p. 119. The following description is from Boulenger:
Tongue moderately elongate, simply papillose, slightly nicked anteriorly. Dentition strictly pleurodont; teeth numerous, small, obtusely conical, with long cylindrical shafts. No pterygoid teeth. Skull thin, much depressed. A rather strong ligamentous postorbital arch; no fronto-squamosal arch; premaxillary single; nasal single; frontal single; parietals two. Vertebre amphicelian; abdominal ribs. Limbs well developed. Clavicles slender, not dilated proximally; interclavicle minute. Skin of head free from skull; teguments soft, granular, and tubercular.
This family contains a single genus, the aberrant Uroplates of Madagascar, which cowbines with a Geckoid structure a peculiar sternal apparatus and the union of the nasal bones.
This family is allied to the Geckonide in its separate parietals, amphiccelous vertebrae, and reduced postorbital border and bar. The undilated clavicles, however, justify Boulenger’s separation of it from that family, and the fusion of the nasal bones emphasize the distinction. It includes but one genus, which is characterized as follows:
Digits depressed, more or less webbed, with very small equal scales inferiorly, the extremity strongly dilated, with two diverging series of lamelle inferiorly; all the digits clawed, the claw retractile in the anterior notch of the distal expansion.
Body covered with small juxtaposed scales. Pupil vertical. No eyelids. Ear opening distinct. No preanal nor femoral pores ---..-.----------Uroplates Gray.
This genus includes three species, which are confined to Madagascar.

Characters of the skeleton in this family are the following:
Premaxillary single, in contact with maxillopalatines. Splenial bone well developed, Meckel’s groove exposed; coronoid produced anteriorly and not posteriorly on external face of ramus; angular little developed on inner, much developed on outer side of ramus; dentary not produced posteriorly. Supratemporal fossa not roofed by ossification. Nasal bones codssified.
The visceral characters of Varanus, the only genus of the family, are unlike those of other genera of lizards. The heart and liver occupy a more posterior position than usual, the heart being much further posterior to the sternum than any other family, and adjacent to the liver. The lungs do not partake in this peculiarity, since they begin a considerable distance anterior to the heart and terminate opposite the proximal extremity of the iiver, instead of lying on either side of that organ and coterminous with it, which is the position in other Sauria.
The trachea bifurcates well cephalad of the lungs, presenting much longer bronchi than any other type. The aorta roots in like manner make their posterior curvature anterior to the usual position. The liver is bilobate at both extremities, but the right lobe is much produced distally into a striplike process, as in most other Sauria. The gall-bladder is on the superior side of the liver within the posterior border, and is not visible from below. The alimentary canal is of moderate length, and the sinall intestine is well specialized from the stomach, There is no dilatation constricted off as acolon. Urinary bladder and corpora adiposa present. The latter do not project freely into the celom, but lie between the peritoneum and the body walls.
The peritoneal folds have the following distribution: There are two gastrohepatic sheets, but the right is much shorter caudad than the left. There is no sheet connecting the left lobe of the liver with the body wall nor are there any connecting the distal border of the liver with either body wall. A sheet, however, connects the right border of the liver with the body wall. At the middle of the hepatic border this sheet is single, but at the cephalad and ecaudad extremities it is double, producing funnel-shaped sacs which open toward each other. Ventral mesentery single, and not extending beyond liver. <A strong sheet of peritoneum connects the pericardium with the body wall on each side.
The great ease with which the peritoneum is separated from the body walls in Varanus has led authors to make some curious statements. Thus Giinther says! that the cor poe adiposa are inclosed in a
‘The aatomy of Rajon ocellata, Proce. Zool. Soe. London, Ponraary -March, 1861.

separate sac of the “peritoneum.” ‘They occupy the usual position outside of the peritoneum, and as they do not project freely into the body cavity, can not be said to occupy separate sacs. In lizards where they do project into the colom they do occupy pouches of peritoneum. Beddard! does not regard the ventral peritoneum as such, but thinks it to be distinct from it, calling it the ‘horizontal membrane.” But it has all the relations of the ventral peritoneum of other lizards, and I believe it to be truly such. It is very loosely attached to the muscular walls by connective tissue.
In Varanus salvator the hemipenis is furnished with transverse flounces, which are longitudinally ribbed, except at the thin edge. The folds form a chevron directed distad. Apex smooth. In JV. arenarius the apex is smooth, and on the base are longitudinal series of acute papille. In V. griseus the organ is entirely smooth in a specimen examined, but I do not know whether this condition is normal.
Boulenger remarks of the Varanide as follows:
Tongue smooth, very long and slender, bifid, retractile into a sheath at the base, Teeth large, dilated at the base, which is fixed to the inner side of the jaws. Palate toothless. Premaxillary single, narrowed, and much prolonged posteriorly; nasal bones coalesced and narrow; two frontals; a single parietal; a supraorbital bone; postorbital arch incomplete; a bony Sipiestoriiuest arch; pterygoids and pala-
tines widely separated; infraorbital fossa bounded by the Bidmeacnd palatine, and transverse bone, the maxillary being excluded.
The characters of the genus Varanus are as follows: ee paacee
No dermal cranial ossifications; head covered with small polygonal scales. Lyelids well developed; ear-opening distinct. Limbs well developed; clavicle slender; interclavicle anchor-shaped. Dorsal scales roundish, juxtaposed, surrounded by rings of minute granules; ventral scales squarish, arranged in cross rows. No femoral or preanal pores. Tongue sheathed at base. Tail very long.

In the mandible, Meckel’s cartilage is not overroofed by the splenial bone. The dentary is not produced far posteriorly on the external side. The surangular bone is distinct. The symphysis mandible is not closely fitted, but is more or less free.
The genus Varanus includes, according to Boulenger, 28 species. None of these are of small size, and some of them reach a length of 6 feet.

Several descriptions of the skull and parts of the skeleton of Heloderma have been published, but all of them are seriously defective in not taking into account certain of the characters which are essential to a true understanding of the taxonomic position of the genus.

terior border abruptly emarginate to receive an anterior process of the vomers. The latter are very elongate, in contact for the anterior twothirds of their length, but widely divaricating posteriorly; thin inferior surface convex in transverse sections; narial fossx very large, the anterior extremity much narrowed. Palatine bones wider than long, the vomerine and palatine limbs subequal; palatine foramen very small, longitudinal; pterygoid narrowed anterior to basipterygoid processes, the anterior portion expanding gradually from behind; no pterygoid teeth; ectopterygoid flat; nasals narrow, encroached on each side of the middle by the elongate nostrils and with very slight contact with the prefrontals; frontals distinct from each other, wide; inferior plates oblique, in contact below, thus inclosing the olfactory lobes; parietal undivided, expanded laterally and without pineal foramen; supraoccipital scarcely in contact with parietal, which overhangs it; parietoquadrate arch very distinct, wide, its distal portion in front consisting of the large paroccipital; exoccipitals suturally distinct from both supraana basi-occipital; facial plate of maxillary very large; prefrontals elongate, extending over the orbit to meet the postfrontals; lachrymal small, scarcely touching prefrontal, bounding the large lachrymal foramen anteriorly and in contact with jugal. The latter is an Lshaped bone, the subvertical limb reaching the postfrontal; postfrontal rather large, irregularly subtriangular; no postorbital ; supratemporal a vertically triangular rudiment at the anterior base of the paroccipital ; quadrate with one, an extero-posterior, conch; presphenoid cartilaginous; sphenoid and basioccipital distinct, not expanded laterally, the lateral descending tuberosities of the latter well defined; a large condylar foramen divided by an interna! partition; occipital condyle distinetly tripartite; the pterygoid originates opposite the basipterygoids and touches both the petrosal and parietal, the latter sending down a slight lateral ridge. The subforaminal portion of the petrosal is not as long as the supraforaminal part and has a mere trace of a groove on its external side.
In the mandible the groove of Meckel’s cartilage is open throughout. The coronoid bone is extended in both directions on the inner side and anteriorly only on the external side. The dentary is short, not extending behind the anterior suture of the coronoid; splenial rather elevated, extending anterior to splenial foramen; surangular and articular distinct; angle narrowed, directed gently inward.
The hyoid apparatus is simple. Nosecond ceratobranchials; the first simple osseous. Ceratohyal much curved, returning posteriorly on itself anteriorly to meet the extremity of the rather short hypohyal.
sasihyal not wide.
There are only two ossified intercentra of the cervical vertebrae, and there are no hypapophyses. Atlas and two cervicals only without ribs. No zygosphene; prezygaspophysial surface simple. The two sacral centra and diapophyses are not coossified. Caudal ceutra not seg

mented, furnished with short diapophyses, chevron bones, and neural spines to near the end of the series; the last-named standing at the posterior border of the neural arch. Chevrons attached at posterior end of centrum, completely developed. Neural spines of cervical vertebrie moderate; those of lumbar region low.
Suprascapula short, wide; scapula short without proscapula; coracoid without emargination; epicoracoid large. Sternum with a small anterior fontanelle and a posterior emargination and an unossified line connecting the two; a groove diverges from the fontanelle on each side parallel to the coracoid border. Four sternal ribs on each side and no xiphoidrod. All the ribs with short, cartilaginous, free heemapophyses.
liium slender, without angulus criste; acetabulum not emarginate. Pubis subtransverse; pectineal process small, external. Ischium rather wide, tuber an angle only.
The teeth have been frequently described, owing to their seeming adaptation to act as venom conduits to the wound they can inflict. They are pleurodont and attached by a very oblique base rather than by the side. The crown is conic and compressed acutely at the tip. The anterior face is marked by a deep groove which runs external to the middle line. It is formed by the rolling inward of the external layer of the crown over the anterior face of the tooth, at the base, the roll being less and less distinct upward.
The mesenteries of Heloderma are characteristic. There is a single hepatoventral, and the gastrohepatic has the usual position. The right hepatic goes to the right side of the stomach, becoming a right gastrohepatic, and does not extend to the dorsal peritoneum, a character in which it is unique in the Sauria. Posterior to the middle of the liver they unite on the middle line as in the Teiidie. The lungs are attached to the adjacent parts of the gastric peritoneum by separate sheets, the right and left gastropulmonary. Besides these there is a strong sheet on each side extending from the superior side of the liver near the border to the body wall, forming the right and left hepatolateral. The right hepatolateral does not extend along the right border of the liver beyond the cephalad half. The right gastrohepatic extends along the elongate right process of the liver ‘to the genital fold of the peritoneum, and the apex of the liver sends a recurrent sheet backward, which forms with the former a funnel-shaped passage. This recurrent sheet might be regarded as a caudad hepatolateral. Dr. Shufeldt states! that Heloderma possesses the free ventral peritoneum found in Varanus; but this is not the case, as this structure is the usual one.
The peritoneum forms a transverse fold at the posterior part of the corpora adiposa, supporting the urinary bladder, and forming the cystic mesentery. It is but loosely attached to the corpora adiposa, which do not project freely from the body wall, and hence have no Special peritoneal pouch. They are elongate and coarsely subdivided.
' Proe. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1890, pp. 193, 194.

<<<Page: 501>>>

The two aorta roots extend considerably anterior to the heart before turning posteriorly; the right root receives near its origin the common carotid, which soon thereafter divides into the right and left carotid, The right and left bronchi are distinct, but not elongate. The lungs are of subequal length; they are filled with coarse cells for about twothirds their length. ,
The liver extends cephalad to the heart by its left lobe, the right falling a little short. The entire organ is large and elongate, the right lobe extending considerably beyond the left, but not terminating in a narrow strip, as in many Pachyglossa. The gall-bladder looks downward through a round foramen of the liver, between its two distal lobes, which are joined caudad to it. The alimentary canal includes an elongate stomach, followed by a rather elongate small intestine, which passes gradually into a moderately large rectum: ‘The muscular walls of the stomach are not thick. The kidneys are rather wide, and about two-thirds of their length is within the pelvic cavity, the remaining third projecting anteriorly to it.
The hemipenis is undivided. Opposite to the suleus spermaticus is a welt, which is smooth; between it and the sulcus are coarse plicate transverse folds, which extend to the apex of the organ.
There are two species of this genus, which differ as follows:
Pterygo-palatine teeth present; tail equal or longer than body; head and neck about
half body; fore limbs to orbit; predominating color, black .-......-.. H. horridum. No pterygo-palatine teeth; tail two-thirds body; head and neck one-third body; fore limb to orbit; predominating color, yellow ...-...----..----.-----H, suspectum.
The Heloderma horridum Wiegmann has been brought from western Mexico, from Presidio on the north to as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It has not been brought from eastern Mexico, so far as Iam aware. The H. suspectum Cope is restricted to southern Arizona and New Mexico, so that a wide interval intervenes between the ranges of the two species.

width of the brown rings, which are almost separated into two by an imperfect bar beneath and a series of four round spots on each side above, colored like the interspaces and involving four to six tubercles. One of these rings above the shoulders crosses the forearm. Another passes above the arms and across the middle of the thigh. The rest of the legs, with the entire head and throat, are black, except at the top of head behind the eyes, which is yellow. The tail, including the tip, shows four black rings and three yellow ones.
This regular arrangement of pattern on the body is appreciable only in the young. With increasing age the rings become broken up, and the pattern becomes an irregular, coarse reticulation of blackish, embracing the yellow tubercles, one or more looking like differently colored beads. The yellow predominates in some specimens, the black in others. The head is always black, with its yellow parietal patch.
Form clumsy and very heavy; head much broader than the neck, much depressed and flat above, the sides vertical and approaching each other anteriorly at an acute angle, but the muzzle broad and rounded.
The animal is covered everywhere except below with large tubercles, about the size of grains of No. 6 shot, each with a bony nucleus. These are subhemispherical, but generally somewhat calyptrate, exhibiting a blunted apex which is directed a little backward. Most of these exhibit a series of circular ridges and furrows parallel with the base of the tubercle. These vary in number, never extend to the a of the tubercle, and are generally confined to the base.
These tubercles are arranged in regular series, which run obliquely backward from a shallow furrow along the back (from behind the shoulders to the tail) to the sides. They are, however, set in a frame of much smaller tubercular scales, generally in single series, sometimes more crowded. This framework constitutes a quite regularly hexagonal tessellation, with the rounded large tubercle set in the middle of each piece. Besides the obliquely longitudinal arrangement of the large tubercles, they may be traced in a more transverse one of fifteen or sixteen on each side.
On the belly and beneath the tail the tubercles change to quadrate aud nearly square tessellated plates, close together and without intervening smaller ones. These also exhibit a tendency to arrangement in reference to a median line. They are placed in transverse series, corresponding in number with those of the sides and back, the change from one to the other not being very strongly marked. There are about twenty-five across the belly, and about sixty series from the end of the throat to the groin, with five or six more in the pubic region, where the plates are more irregular, the anal slit bordered by two median ones larger than the rest. The tail shows about fifty-five whorls of tubercles and plates corresponding with those on the body. It is very thick and blunt, subtetrahedral, and widening a little from the base to the middle.

<<<Page: 504>>>

The legs are covered with tubercles much as on the back, but smaller, and in places more depressed, especially on the under surface of the hind leg and the upper of the forearm. They are still smaller and more distant on the posterior face of the humerus.
The tubercles on the top of the head are larger than those on the back, and compacted, without the intervening small ones, giving somewhat of a hexagonal shape. They become larger to the tip of snout and are quite similar on the cheeks. The nostrils are terminal, lateral, large, and semicircular, the chord vertical and anterior, formed by two nearly square plates, one above the other. The rostral is about half as high as long, nearly quadrangular or depressed pentagonal. On each side of it is one labial of equal height, succeeded by twelve others, the first four or five of which have a second series above them. The mental plate is as wide as the rostral. There are about twelve labials on each side of this. There are four median pairs of large subquadrate plates behind the mental, and four or five smaller, more hexagonal series between these and the labial. The rest of the under surface of the head is covered with regular elongated ovoidal tubercles, half as large as those on the back, but without intervening smaller ones.
The ears are vertical or a little oblique, quite large, though not very conspicuous. The eyes are small, the eyelids short, very thick, and covered with tubercles, one series above and two below. Although the entire head is cover2d with tubercles, there may be traced a series of about six behind and below the eye, with a continuation of four more quadrate ones to the nostril.
The legs are short and stout, the hinder scarcely, if any, longer than the anterior. The feet are all five-toed, with conspicuous claws. The fore feet are decidedly larger and broader, with considerably longer claws than the hinder ones. All the digits exhibit inferiorly a series of transverse, imbricated, coarse lamelle. The fingers are nearly of equal length, the claws of first and fifth reaching as far as bases of those of second, third, and fourth. The toes are more unequal; the third and fourth about equal, the second claw reaching the base of the third, the fifth that of second, the first that of fifth.
The teeth of Heloderma are acrodont, or on the summit of elevations of the bones bearing them. They are long, conical, acute, slightly recurved, and all have a conspicuous furrow on the anterior face from the base to tip, apparently formed by the folding together of a triangular plate. I can detect no evidence of any poison glands. The teeth are few in number, distant, eight or ten on each side of each jaw, and though long are so much embedded in the fleshy gums as to exhibit only the points. They are contined to the anterior part of the jaws, and do not come as far back as the posterior nares. The palate is deeply but broadly excavated, the pterygoid bones are prominent, and in one Specimen bear a single conical tooth.

The tongue is thick and fleshy; arrow-shaped or oblong cordate; the base deeply emarginate with rounded lobes, the tip thin, flattened, and bifid for about one-fifth the whole length. Posteriorly it is covered by coarse papille or short filaments; on the terminal half these are much shorter, lower, and more compact, while the ends of the bifid tip are smooth. The tongue is attached firmly along its middle (though per-
haps narrowly) for the basal two-thirds, the terminal portion being Z
free, smooth beneath, and divided by a median furrow, the portion covering the bifid tip rather distinct and ovate.
The skin of the tail is very rough and continuous, so that it holds together the vertebrze very firmly and does not allow the tail to break. A specimen has the tail partly decomposed, and jet the tough skin keeps all the vertebre together.
The description of Heloderma suspectum, as given above, differs in some important points from that of Wiegmann’s of the H. horridum. A conspicuous difference of the external features is seen in the small tubercles encircling the large ones, said by Wiegmann to be wanting and forming the basis of subfamily distinction from the Varanide. These tubercles, though small and containing no bony center like the large ones, are yet very appreciable. The large tubercles are more widely separated in his figure than in nature, owing, doubtless, to the skin being stretched, which would at the same time eradicate the small basal intermediate tubercles. The tail is given as equal to the body instead of half the head and body, and is also more attenuated. It is said to have five yellow rings instead of four. The head is entirely black. These characters are confirmed by three specimens sent by Mr. F. Sumichrast from Tehuantepec, Mexico, all stuffed skins, and which served as the basis of comparison when I distinguished this species from the H. horridwm.
I find the following characters to be constant: When specimens of the two species with identical body length are compared the tail of the
H, suspectum is seen to be about two-thirds the length of that of the ©
H. horridum, and the muzzle of the H. suspectum reaches only to the front of the orbit of the H. horridum. The forefoot reaches to the nostril in
the H. suspectum and to the orbit in the H. horridum. The scales on ¢
the head of the H. horridwm are larger than those on the H. suspectum,
especially posterior to the orbit; but, as the head is longer in the former, —
the number counted between the orbit and the ear is equal in the two
species. In counting across the head from one angle of the mouth to ey the other I find 21 scales in the H. suspectum and 17 in the H. horridum. ji In the latter I count 44 crossrows of abdominal scales; in the former 52. The ground color in the H. horridum is black, and yellow marks are sparse. In the H. suspectwm the yellow is more conspicuous than ; the black on the head and on the belly, and is equally so on the upper my
surfaces of the body and tail. The dimensions of the two species are about the same.

Boulenger ! further adds the following differences between the two:
In the H. suspectum the oral portion of the premaxillary is narrower, and its ascending internarial bar wider than in the //.horridum. Eight or nine premaxillary teeth are present in H. horridum and only six in H. suspectum. Dr. Shufeldt, however, represents eight teeth in the latter species, but his figure showing all the teeth as of the same size looks very diagrammatic. The postorbital arch is more slender in H. suspectum. Palatine and pterygoid teeth appear to be constantly absent in H. suspectum, whereas they are present in both skulls of H. horridum examined by me, as well as in those described by Troschel and by Kaup
I remark on these statements, that in two crania of H. suspectum before me there are no pterygoid or palatine teeth, except that in one there are two rudiments on the palatine of one side and one rudiment on the other. In both there are alveoli for eight premaxillary teeth, and in both only one of these is unoccupied by a tooth. In both the premaxillary spine is wide at the base, as described by Boulenger for the H. suspectum, but in both it is long, as described by him for the H. horridum.
Habits.—It has been shown that the bite of the Heloderma suspectum is, under favorable circumstances, poisonous. Experiments tried at or near Tucson, Arizona, by Dr. Irwin, United States Army, in 1862-63, did not demonstrate this fact, as fowls bitten by the Heloderma did not die. Dr. R. W. Shufeldt was bitten by a specimen at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and he describes his symptoms in a paper published in the American Naturalist.
The results were not serious nor different from such as result from any lacerated wound. Experiments made by Drs. 8S. Weir Mitchell and Edward I’. Reichert, of the University of Pennsylvania, showed that the saliva injected into the body is speedily fatal to pigeons and fowls.
The history of observations as to the venomous characteristics of this species is thus given by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt:?
At the present writing the wide variance of opinion in these premises is truly remarkable, for some of our most distinguished investigators still disagree in the matter, and those, too, who have made the most exhaustive examinations of the saliva of this reptile.
As long ago as 1857, John Edward Gray, of the British Museum, in referring to Necturus, said, ‘‘I know of no other instance of a batrachian having this structure of its teeth, nor do I know of any instance, except in the Mexican lizard called Heloderma horridum, in which all the teeth are uniformly furnished with a basal cavity and foramen, and this lizard is said to be noxious; but the fact has not been distinctly proved.”
Prof. E. D. Cope, who first clearly characterized this reptile and gave it its present name of Heloderma suspectum, has stated that ‘‘though the lizards of this genus could not be proved to inflict a poisonous bite, yet the salivary glands of the lower jaw were emptied by an efferent duct which issued at the base of each tooth, and in such a way that the saliva would be conveyed into the wound by the deep groove of the crown.”
Then several years passed before much else was published upon this special topic
1 Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond , 1891, p. 110. 2New York Medical Journal, May, 1891.

<<<Page: 507>>>

of the life history of the Heloderma, when Sumichrast, a well-known naturalist resident in Mexico, stated it as his opinion that it was the exception that small mammals died from the bite of this saurian.
Soon after there appeared an editorial in the American Naturalist (1882, p. 842) referring to the experiments of Dr. Irwin, of the Army, which went to prove that the bite of the Heloderm was comparatively harmless; but it added, further, that a specimen in the Zoological Garden of London had bitten a frog and a guinea pig, both of which had died ina few moments. Still, the editor of the Naturalist was of the opinion that ‘‘this might happen if this large lizard was not poisonous, and there is room for more careful experiments as to its venomous qualities.”
In the same year no less distinguished an authority than Dr. Giinther, of the British Museum, comes forward and states that there can be no doubt as to the poisonous nature of the bite of Heloderma horridum, and cites numerous cases to support his views; and Dr. Sclater, the secretary of the Zoological Society of “London, apparently entertained a similar opinion, as did also the eminent herpetologist, Mr, Boulenger, of the British Museum.
During the same year the present writer, who was at that time connected with the department of reptiles at the U. 8. National Museum, was severely bitten by an infuriated adult specimen of Heloderma suspectum, and although much painand grave symptoms at once supervened, the results passed entirely away in a few days with barely any treatment. I published a short account of it at the time. Again, before the year closed, Sir Joseph Fayrer brought forth some evidence, deduced from experiments, that went to show the poisonous nature of the bite of a Heloderm,
Early in 1883, however, the matter seemed to be definitely settled for good and all, through the results obtained by the very celebrated experiments of those two distinguished physicians of Philadelphia, Dr. S. Weir Mitchell and Dr. Edward T. Reichert. After a most carefully conducted series of experiments with the saliva taken from living Heloderms, these authorities were prepared to say that it possessed properties of an extremely venomous nature, killing pigeons and small mammals a few moments after they had received an injection of it hypodermically.
Five years now elapsed with hardly a printed word appearing anywhere upon the question of the poisonous or nonpoisonous qualities of the saliva of one of these suspected reptiles. Then there appeared an account of the somewhat remarkable series of experiments made with the saliva of living Heloderms by Dr. H. C. Yarrow at the U.S. National Museum, Dr. Yarrow at the time being honorary curator of the department of reptiles in that institution. This investigator’s methods of procedure were rather different from those adopted by Mitchell and Reichert, but apparently they were conducted with equal care, and, strange to say, led to an entirely different result. Some eight or nine experiments upon chickens and rabbits went to prove that hypodermic injections of the saliva and bites of angry Heloderms were by no means fatal to those animals, and practically they always recovered from the effects of the same. After presenting the steps of his final trial, this author concludes his account with the following remarks: ‘‘This experiment would seem to show that a large amount of the Heloderm saliva can be inserted into the tissues without producing any harm, and it is still a mystery to the writer how Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Reichert obtained entirely different results. Were it not for the well-known accuracy and carefulness of Dr. Mitchell, it might be supposed possibly that the hypodermic syringe used in his experiments contained a certain amount of Crotalus or cobra venom, but under the circumstances such a hypothesis is entirely untenable.” The following year Dr. Mitchell still adhered to his original opinion, and undoubtedly does at the present time.
Mr. Samuel Garman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard University, next made some very interesting experiments by allowing large and vigorous Heloderms to bite the shaved legs of kittens, and here again these feline victims refused to succumb) to the effects of the wounds.

<<<Page: 508>>>

Very evidently the last word upon this subject has not yet been said, and opinions are very much divided, a host of supporters appearing upon either side.
In confinement, as in nature, the Heloderma suspectum is sluggish in its movements. It is not especially timid, and opens its mouth and ejects air in bursts from its lungs at the intruder. Some individuals will seize a stick presented to them and hold on tenaciously. Its breath is fetid, which adds to the forbidding character of the animal. A specimen sent me by Dr. J. G. Gibson from St. Thomas, Arizona, became rather tame, and showed a liking for having the top of its head scratched with a stick. It showed more thar? usual interest in passing events, raising itself on its fore feet and elevating its head as though listening. Like most of the individuals kept in confinement it ate readily of raw eggs, lapping them up with the protrusile smooth extremity of the tongue. They also drink water by inserting the nose into the fluid. In climbing up steep places it utilizes its robust tail as a support, and a very slight hold with the powerful claws of the fore feet is sufficient to enable it to raise itself.
It is not uncommon in the dry and desert regions of southern Arizona. I have heard of its occurrence in the adjacent regions of New Mexico, but did not meet with it myself on any of several visits I paid to that country. Dr. Stejneger reports that the Death Valley exploring expedition obtained a specimen from the Virgin River in southern Nevada. Dr. Merriam was told by the Mormons that the species occurs in the Lower Santa Clara Valley in southwestern Utah, but it is rare.

Diploglossa Cop¥, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1864, p.227; Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 25.
Petrous bone produced anterior to anterior semicircular canal. Clayicle simple proximally. Interclavicle cruciform (with exceptions in degenerate forms). Premaxillary undivided. Mandibular elements distinct; dentary not produced far posteriorly. Tongue papillose, the apex survey and generally retractile into papillose portion.
This superfamily occupies a position between the Pachyglossa and Leptoglossa, having the tongue and clavicle of the former, and the interclavicle and petrous bone of the latter. Its composition is somewhat heterogeneous, since the Zonurid differ in some respects from the other families.
The following characters of the visceral anatomy are common to all the families except the Zonuride :
Alimentary canal with a stomach and elongate rectum only differen-
tiated. Liver very elongate, usually two-lobed posteriorly, the right —
lobe a little longer. Gall-bladder located at the apex of the fissure separating the lobes or proximad to it, exposed inferiorly, or only covered by thin tissue. Corpus adiposum not projecting freely mito the bodycavity (except Zonuride).
Peculiar modifications are exhibited by the snake-like genera, which do not, however, invalidate the preceding definitions. In Pseudopus, Ophisaurus, Dopasia, and Anguis, together with Celestus and Diploglossus (monotropis) which are not snake-like, the left lung is shorter than the right. The liver is greatly elongated in the four genera first named above, and in Ophisaurus (ventralis) the left lobe is absent. In the other snake-like genera it is present, but shorter than the right. In Pseudopus, Ophisaurus, and Anguis the ventral mesentery extends to the rectum. It has a similar extent in Dopasia, but seems to be interrupted. In lacertiform Diploglossa the ventral mesentery is simple and terminates at the liver or a little beyond it.
Zonurus differs in several respects from other Diploglossa. The liver is trilobate posteriorly, but the gall-bladder has the inferior exposure normal to the superfamily. The corpora adiposa project freely into the body-cavity, which is not the case in other Diploglossa.
In Xenosaurus grandis and Celestus stenurus the kidneys are larger than in species of other genera examined.
As already remarked, the hemipenis in this superfamily is transversely laminate or flounced, and is never calyculate. The structures differ much in detail, Thus in some of the Anguide the organ possesses OSseous spines, which is unusual in Sauria, although general in Ophidia. In the Xenosauride it is remarkably papillose. In none of the genera are the lamine delicate and thin as in the Teiide, but they are thick and frequently wrinkled or pocketed.

Four families are referable to the Diploglossa, which are defined as follows. The position of the Pygopodid is somewhat uncertain:

The families of Section I are Old World, the Zonuridie belonging to the Ethiopian zoological realm, and the Pygopodide to the Australian. The remaining families are New World, except that among Anguidee three genera belong to the paliearctic realm.

Tongue short, villose, scarcely protractile, entire or very feebly nicked at the end. Dentition pleurodont; teeth numerous, small, with long cylindrical shafts, hollowed out at the base. Palate toothless. Postorbital and frontosquamosal arches bony; supratemporal fossa roofed over by dermo-ossification; premaxillary, frontal, and parietal single; nasals distinct; palatines and pterygoids widely separated medially, both bordering the infraorbital fossa; head with dermal bony shields. Clavicle slender, not dilated proximally; interclavicle cruciform; sternum without fontanelle. No abdominal ribs. Head symmetrically shielded. Eyelids well developed. Seales on the body, if not granular, arranged in transverse series. Osteodermal plates present in one genus, but devoid of distinct tubules.
Like the preceding, this family has points of resemblance with the Iguanide and with the Anguide., From the former it is distinguished by the cranial dermal ossifications and the cruciform interclavicle; from the latter by the tongue, which, like that of the Iguanidx, is not divisible into an anterior and a posterior part, the celodont dentition, and the structure of the bony plates of the body when present. ( Boulenger. )
Six genera are known, inhabiting South and tropical Africa and Madagasear.

The mesenteries in the genus Zonurus are of the usual type. There are one hepatoventral, a gastrohepatic, a left gastropulmonary, and a right hepatic, which incloses the right lung.
The hemipenis I have only seen in the Zonurus cordylus. It is short and swollen so that the spiral structure is accentuated. There is a rigid welt opposite the sulcus, which leaves a triangular space at one side proximad which is finely calyculate. On the opposite side of the welt distad is a wide space with radiating laminze from a smooth center. The presence of calyculi noted is exceptional in the Diploglossa, and indicates approximation to the Pachyglossa as far as it goes.
The arches and limbs of the degenerate species Mancus macrolepis, from Natal, have the following characters: Scapular and pelvic arches both present. Anterior limbs, none; posterior limb, an externally undivided rudiment.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present. Sternum supporting three hemal ribs on each side, deeply emarginate so as to be horseshoeshaped, with a short posterior prolongation; each branch cartilaginous anteriorly. Suprascapula cartilaginous. Seapula and coracoid con© fluent, osseous; procoracoid cartilage. Interclavicle cruciform, with long posterior axis.
Pelvic arch.—All the elements present, but small and slender. Ilium attached to the distally confluent diapophyses of two vertebrae. Pubes slender, in contact anteriorly. Ischia directed anteriorly, not forming a symphysis, but separated by a median osseous element, which, following Baur, I call the hypogastroid bone. This is produced anteriorly as a cartilage, which joins the pubes, and posteriorly as a median simple cartilaginous rod.
Posterior limb.—This is about as long as the pubis and half the ilium. It consists of a femur, distinct but closely apposed tibia and fibula, about three-fifths the length of the femur, and a simple conical tarsal.

According to Boulenger—
The premaxillary is single, narrowed, and much produced posteriorly between the nasals, in the long-snouted Lialis quite as much as in the Varanidie; the nasals are distinct; the frontal is single; the preand postfrontals are in contact, separating the frontal from the orbit; the parietals remain distinct, except in Lialis; the jugal is rudimentary, there being no postorbital arch; a postfrontosquamosal arch is also absent; the pterygoids are widely separated and toothless. The mandible contains only four bones, the angular, supra-angular, and articular having coalesced. The dentition is pleurodont. The teeth are small, numerous, and closely set; in Lialis they are recurved posteriorly, very acute, and swollen at the base, thus resembling those of the Varanidx, whilst in the other genera they do not diverge from the normal pleurodont type, being obtusely pointed and with long cylindrical shafts. The skin of the head is quite free from the cranial ossification and there are no supraorbital bones. The serpentiform body is destitute of functional limbs; the fore limb is entirely absent, while the hind pair is visible externally as a scaly flap, most developed in Pygopus, in which the bones of the limb may be felt more or less distinctly; when the skin is removed in Pygopus the foot with five ossified toes is seen most plainly, especially in the males; the ischium appears externally as a small spur on each side behind the anal cleft. The sternal apparatus exists in a rudimentary state. The tail is long and fragile. The eyes are rather small, with ellipticovertical or subelliptical pupil, and not protected by movable lids. The ear is either exposed or concealed under the scales. The tongue is fleshy, papillose, elongate, more or less fully incised anteriorly, and extensible. The body is covered with roundish imbricate scales and the head is more or less regularly plated. Preeanal pores are frequently present.

Boulenger’s description is as follows:
The tongue is composed of two distinct portions—a principal posterior, thick, covered with villiform papillz; and a small anterior, thin, emarginate, covered with lepidoid imbricate papillw, extensible and more or less retractile into a sheath formed by a transverse fold at the anterior extremity of the villose portion. This retractility of the distal part of the tongue appears to be constant, though more accentuated in some species than in others; but it should be borne in mind that when the tongue is fully extended, every trace of the transverse fold or sheath disappears, which accounts for the seeming exceptions presented by spirit specimens in that condition.
The dentition varies from the strictly pleurodont tubercular teeth of Pseudopus apus and some Diploglossi, through the conical teeth of the majority of species, to the curved fangs of Anguis. The dentition of the latter has no other equivalent but that of Heloderma, to which it bears considerable resemblance; and Leydig has even discovered the presence of a slight groove along the anterior surface of the teeth which appears to be homologous with the anterior groove of the poisonous lizard’s fangs; the teeth of Anguis are likewise remarkable for the comparatively feeble attachment to the jaws, as in Heloderma and the snakes. ‘The new teeth do not holJow out the base of the old ones, but originate between them. The palate is either toothless, or teeth may be developed on the pterygoids or even on the palatines and vomers (Ophisaurus).
The skull belongs to the normal Saurian type. The premaxillary is single; nasals distinct; frontal single in Gerrhonotus, double in the other genera; parietal single; palatines and pterygoids well separated along the medial line; infraorbital fossa bounded by the palatine, pterygoid, transverse bone, and maxillary. Dermal cranial ossifications are present, which roof over the supratemporal fossa. The limbs

may be more or less developed, or entirely absent externally, in which case, however, the rudiments of the pectoral and pelvic arches are always present. The clavicle is slender, and the interclavicle, in the species with well-developed limbs, eruciform. Abdominal ribs are absent.
The body is protected by bony plates underlying the scales, which are imbricate and subequal. These plates are provided with a system of fine tubules, as in the Scincidx, which differ from those of the latter family in being arranged irregularly or forming radiating or arborescent figures. The head shields present this peculiarity, that an occipital or azygous posterior shield is constantly present, a character which differentiates the Anguide from most of the Scincidee.
These lizards are terrestrial. Anguisisovoviviparous. They are most abundantly represented in Central America (Gerrhonotus) and the West Indies (Celestus); a few species occur in North and South America; two in Europe and the borders of the Mediterranean, and one in the Himalayas and Burma,
This family I constructed from fragments of the old Zonuride and Scincide, agreeing with Peters in referring the Old World representatives of the former to the Lacertidz and those of the New to the neighborhood of Heloderma. From the Scincide I have taken the New World Diploglossine, finding them possessed of the same peculiar characters which associate Pseudopus with Gerrhonotus and Heloderma. Tie families represented by these types do not possess the dilated maxillary lamin of the Scineidie.
There are four subgroups among the genera of Anguidie, namely: Ophisaurine, with the anterior limb of the mesosternum very short or wanting, the dorsal scales in crossrows and a lateral fold; genera Dopasia, Pseudopus, Ophisaurus, and Opheodes. Anguinze, with shortened mesosternum and no lateral fold; Opheodes and Anguis. Diploglossine, without lateral fold, with elongate anterior limb of mesosternum and quineuncial scales, containing Onida, Panolopus, Sauresia, Diploglossus, Microlepis, and Celestus. (In D. monotropis Peters I have observed an apparent exception to the rule of the retractility of the end of the tongue in this tribe.) Finally, in the preceding groups there is a large foramen which connects the nasal meatus with the anterior part of the palate on each side in the premaxillary bone, which is wanting in the Gerrhonotinz, and there are dermai shields on the parietal and occipital regions, which are represented by scales in the Gerrhonotine.
The hemipenis presents well-marked characters, which distinguish the genera and perhaps the subfamilies. In Celestus the extremity carries an osseous spicule of relatively large size. Distad of the flounces are inore (C. stenurus) or less (C. badius) numerous longitudinal series of recurved osseous spines, which are longer near the suleus spermaticus. In C. stenurus the flounces are apiculate at regular intervals. Organ undivided. In the Gerrhonotin the flounces are cupped and continue to the apex without spines; in Barissia and Gerrhonotus the organ is bifurcate; in Higaria simple. In Anguis a welt on each side of the sulcus has tubercular cross ridges, and the remainder of the surface is marked with oblique folds with tubercular margins, forming a chevron which is directed distad. In Pseudopus apus the organ is not symmetrical. Opposite the sulcus is a low, broad, smooth welt, and on

<<<Page: 515>>>

each side the sulcus is margined by a thin welt or lip. This is coarsely plicate transversely, the plice extending to the welt. On the other side the transverse plicze terminate at a band of fine longitudinal folds. In Ophisaurus the organ is undivided, and there is a welt with one edge and the proximal end free. It is covered with robust papilli.

I have examined the osteology of three exotic serpentiform genera, with the following result:

Scapular and pelvic arches present; no limbs.
Scapular arch.—Interclavicle wanting; other elements pr esene Sternum roughly transverse diamond shaped, with the posterior border slightly convex. No costal connections. Ossification slight.

riorly, and is recurved at the anterior apex, to continue as the slender procoracoid cartilage.
Pelvic arch.—Three: elements fused into one, as in the preceding genera, the distal elements forming a suboval plate; the ilium a short, curved rod, articulating proximally with a single robust diapophysis of a single vetebra, The whole structure is entirely lateral.
Observations—Duméril and Bibron commit an error in their figure of the Anguis fragilis, in representing the pelvic elements as meeting on the middle line below, which is far from being the case. Fiirbringer’s figures are much more accurate.
Opheodes striatus Spix. Partially described by Miiller,’ imperfectly figured by Duméril and Bibron,? and well described and figured by Fiirbringer.’ South America.
Seapular and pelvic arches present; no anterior limbs; posterior limbs present, rudimental.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present; clavicles well developed; distally simple. Interclavicle approximated to them, anchor-shaped, with very short posterior axis, which is widely separated from the sternum. Seapula, coracoid, and precoraeoid, osseous, confluent; no coracoid cartilage. Precoracoid cartilage a slender rod, wedged between the interclavicle and the clavicle. Sternum subtriangular, with shallow anterior notch, supporting two hzemal ribs on each side.
Pelvic arch.—All the elements present, the pubis and ischium not in contact on the median line. Ilium articulating below its middle with the confluent diapophyses of two vertebrie. Pubis about as long as ilium, the distal half rodlike, and separated from its fellow by a space equal to its length. It terminates in a short cartilaginous rod, which is directed forward (? epigastroid cartilage). The ischium is transverse in position, and somewhat expanded distally, sending forward a membranous sheet to the pubis. Posteriorly it gives origin to a cartilaginous rod (hypogastroid) which speedily joins its fellow, and continues with it as a double median cartilage, terminating acutely. This cartilage resembles that already described in Pygopus, where, however, the two do not meet on the middle line.
Posterior limb.—This is a little longer than the ilium. It consists of femur, tibia and fibula about two-thirds as long, and tarsal and metatarsal elements, all closely adherent. The former are three in number and the latter two.
Observations.—In the figure by Duméril and Bibron of the scapular arch the precoracoid is omitted. The pelvis has been drawn from a dried specimen where the inferior arches have been divided and the lateral elements widely separated. The cartilages are not represented.
Dopasia gracilis Gray. From the Himalayas. Not previously studied. Scapular and pelvic arches present; no limbs.

<<<Page: 517>>>

Scapular arch.—Interclavicle wanting; clavicles present, osseous, meeting medially. Scapula cartilaginous; coracoid osseous. <A large ~ coracoid cartilage, which is continued proximally into the short and narrow precoracoid cartilage. Sternum without rib connections, of a transversely crescentic form, the convexity anterior, with some ossific — deposit at the middle, on each side of the median line.
Pelvic arch.—The three elements fused into a single piece, of which the ilium forms a slender proximal part and the distal elements an oval plate, concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly; the whole entirely lateral in position, and having a general resemblance to the corresponding parts of Ophisaurus. Jlium short, its proximal extremity in contact with a very robust diapophysis of a single vertebra.
Observations.—The absence of the interclavicle justifies the retention of the genus Dopasia Gray as distinct from Ophisaurus. I have examined two skeletons of the D. gracilis and a half dozen of those of O. ventralis.
The characters of Ophisaurus are pointed out under that genus.
The viscera do not display any exceptional features, except as to the serpentiform genera referred to under the head of Diploglossa. The mesenteries are of the typical character, modified in Ophisaurus by the reduction of the left lung. The hepatoventral sheet is very near the left margin of the liver in Pseudopus apus, and the gastrohepatic and right hepatic are near together when slack. :
OPHISAURUS Daudin.
Ophisaurus DAUDIN, Hist. Rept., VII, p. 346.—F1TziINGER, N. Classif. Rept., 1826, p. 20.—WAGLER, Syst. Amph., 1830, p. 159.—W1EGMANN, Herp. Mex., 1834, p. 11.—DUMERIL and BIBRON, V, 1839, p. 421.—GrRay, Cat. Liz., 1845, p. 55.— BOULENGER, part, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 1885, II, p. 279.
Hyalinus MERREM, Tent. Amphib., 1820, p. 79.
Body serpentiform, without external trace of limbs. A deep lateral groove from near head to anus. Scales hard, bony, in transverse series. An external ear, and scaly eyelids. Nostrils lateral, in a single plate. Tongue arrow-shaped, notched, and flat anteriorly, where it is free for about half its length. Palatine teeth. Tail much longer than body.
The genus Ophisaurus is similar to the Gerrhonoti in essential characters, but differs in the absence of limbs. The fold on each side is occupied by a soft skin which connects the dorsal and the ventral sheets of plates, the latter folding or lapping over the upper and concealing its lower edge. The plates on the body are quadrate and arranged in transverse series, the dorsal and ventral not corresponding in size and separated, as stated. On the tail the scales are in whorls, or bony rings, between which fractures occur very readily.
In this genus the skeleton resembles in many respects Gerrhonotus, while presenting some important differences, which will be indivated below. Premaxillary with elongate spine above, and concave palatal margin interrupted by a short posteriorly produced angle on the middle

<<<Page: 518>>>

line. The nasals are elongate and distinct from each other. The frontal is narrow and double; its inferior lateral plates converge below, but are separated by a wide fissure. The parietal is rather elongate, and the pineal foramen is near its middle. The parieto-quadrate arches are horizontal, but well elevated above the occipital. The supraoccipital is so loosely articulated as not to touch the parietal, and it is separated by suture from the exoccipitals. The prefrontal is rather small and is not protuberant; it is not produced on the superior orbital border. The facial plate of the maxillary is large, and forms most of the lateral boundary of the nasals. The lachrymal is small and is barely reached by the narrow jugals. Postfrontal distinet, triradiate, the inferior limb shortest, the superior in contact equally, one with the frontal and one with the parietal. Infratemporal splint-like, very little in contaet with jugal, separated by a narrow, slit from parietal, and entering for a considerable distance into the parieto-quadrate arch. Paroecipital exhibiting a narrow wedge from behind. Quadrate a deeply excavated external conch and a trace of the internal. Vomers elongate, each traversed by an elevated median keel; posterior ends separated by a deep notch, continuous with the rather narrow space which separates the palatines and the anterior part of the pterygoid. Narial fissure narrow, a portion cut off anteriorly as a small foramen by a lateral expansion of the vomer. A rather large foramen between maxillary and premaxillary. Maxillary process of palatine a little longer than vomerine process. Palatine foramen large; palatine bones rather narrow. Pterygoids rather narrow, the contraction of the external border gradual. Ectopterygoid not decurved proximally. Sphenoid and basioccipital coossified; lateral processes of latter compressed, concave posteriorly. Occipital condyle small, its tripartite composition faintly indicated. Epipterygoid arising just in front of basipterygoid, not reaching parietal, but resting on supraforaminal part of petrosal, which is longer than the infraforaminal process. The latter possesses a shallow canal, which is presented externally behind.
In the mandible Meckel’s cartilage is concealed, except distally on the inferior face of the ramus. The external face of the coronoid is produced anteriorly only, and the dentary is produced posteriorly very little behind the line of its anterior angle. Angular mostly external; splenial elongate; articular and surangular fused on the external face of the ramus. The angle is horizontal, short, and rounded.
The hyoid apparatus is characterized by the absence of second ceratobranchials and free epibranchials. The first ceratobranchials are rather short. The hypobranchials are rather long, and the ceratohyals project a little beyond their extremity. The middle of the length of the ceratohyals is membranous.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present, but more or less rudimental. Clavicles well developed, simple, and nearly meeting distally. Scapula cartilaginous, coracoid osseous, with a large cartilage which is pro

<<<Page: 519>>>

duced anteriorly and is continuous with the small cartilaginous procoracoid. Interclavicle posterior to the coracoid cartilages and overlapping the anterior border of the sternum; its anterior axis very short, the posterior still shorter. Sternum transverse, subcrescentic, cartilaginous, not supporting any ribs. :
In the cervical vertebre the odontoid process is short, and is coossified. There are six intercentra; the sixth low, the rest rather prominent. All the cervicals have ribs, except the axis and third. No zygosphene; prezysapophysial faces not reflected on neural arch. Diapophyses very short; neural spines moderately elevated, especially on cervical and caudal regions. On the latter they are rather narrow and stand at the posterior border of the neural arch, looking backward. At the anterior border is a second short spinous neural spine, which looks forward. A gap, which is roofed by membrane, separates the anterior from the posterior borders of the neural arches. The centrum is not segmented, but breaks very readily immediately behind the cup and in front of the diapophyses. Chevron bones coossified with the middles of the centra, and not intercentral. The centra, except at the ball-and-socket articulations, are quite as attenuated as the neural arches, whence their great fragility.
Pelvie arch.—Ilium short, proximally in contact with a single vertebra, distally confluent with the rudimental pubis and ischium, which form together an oval plate, entirely lateral in position.
Posterior limb.—This is an undivided short rod of cartilage, which is loosely articulated to the posterior concavity of the pelvic element, thus marking the position of the acetabulum. All the teeth simple and with acuminate apex.
Besides the peculiarities resulting from the reduction of the extremities, this genus differs from Gerrhonotus as follows: The presence of maxillopremaxillary foramen; the isolation of the anterior part of the posterior narial fissure as a foramen; the coossification of the sphenoid and basioccipital bones. The nonsegmentation of the caudal centra; the presence of two neural spines on them, and the very peculiar chevron bones.
But one species of this genus is known. Boulenger unites the genera Pseudopus, Hyalosaurus, and Dopasia with it; but Pseudopus and Hyalosaurus have posterior limbs, and I have shown that Dopasia has no interclavicle.! Hyalosaurus also has the auricular meatus closed.

There is a large and broad oblong frontal plate, and behind it a pentagonal interparietal, bordered by anelongate parietal plate on each side. The interfrontonasal is half as long as the frontal. There are two

frontoparietals which are in contact with the fourth supraocular plate. There are two series of plates, supraorbitals and superciliaries, along the edge of the head, above the eve. The eyelids are distinct, the lower well covered with scales, There are two pairs of internasals and a

<<<Page: 521>>>

series of three more plates (one azygous) between them and the rostral. The nostril perforates a single small nasal plate. The space between this and the eye is occupied by two rows of five plates, with two other rows in a line above these posteriorly. Labials either bordering orbit,
or more frequently separated by one or two rows of scales. Ten upper 4
labials. Ears a short longitudinal closed slit or foramen of varying size in line between the mouth and lateral groove. .
There are sixteen longitudinal series of plates in the dorsal sheet, the outer on each side the narrower, and ten in the ventral, the outer narrower; 126 in series from head to tail. The central six rows on the back have a distinct though blunt carination, almost inappreciable on the next rows; the rest of the lateral and all the ventral perfectly smooth. Tail very long. Seven or eight preanal scales, a little larger than the abdominal.
The color in most specimens from the Atlantic States is a very dark, greenish olive above; posterior border (in the corners) of each scale, with two bluish or greenish white rounded spots. The central line of each series, especially where traversed by the ridge, is darker than the ground color and not spotted. The under parts are plain greenish white. The top and sides of the head are spotted like the back.
A few Atlantic specimens have the central eight or nine rows of scales brownish or olivaceous yellow, the checkers or tessellation of the first variety showing through either irregularly or as transverse bands of black spotted with white. In many specimens three stripes above the fold on each side may be indistinctly outlined, while in others the three stripes may be perfectly distinct. These may be reduced to two or even one stripe, and occasionally traces of a fourth may be

present. With these may or may not be associated a median dorsal —
stripe. There are considerable variations in the squamation of this species. The most usual is that which coucerns the contact.of the interfronto-
nasal with the frontal. This contact is rarely wide, is frequently —
narrow, and less frequently does not exist, the prefrontals being in contact on the middle line. I exhibit this and the presence of two interfrontonasals in the following table:
I. One interfrontonasal. A. Interfrontonasal broadly in contact with frontal; Cat. No. 15537 (a), halfgrown; Witchita River, Texas, E. D. Cope, adult. B. Contact narrow; Cat. Nos. 8944, 14584, 9358 (young), adult; (2 adults); Cat. Nos. 14142 (2 spec.); 5322, 15537 (b) adult; 12783, 13809, 4985, 9360.
C. No contact between frontal and interfrontonasal; Cat. Nos. 3201, 20811, 9358 —
(young), 15537 (c) adult; 5731 half-grown; 5130, 16949, 10584. Il. Two interfrontonasals, anterior and posterior.
Anterior interfrontonasal fused with right posterior internasal; Cat. No. 10584.
Anterior interfrontonasal distinct, Cat. No. 21359.
The degree of the carination of the scales varies considerably, but it is generally more couspicuous in the young than in the adult. Usually a

<<<Page: 522>>>

row of scales separates the labials from the eye, and sometimes there are two rows. Inthe type of the var. sulcatus one labial enters the eye border, and in Cat. No. 21359 two labials enter it.
The color varieties may be presented in the following form:
I. Lateral scales of the body with spots.
A. Dorsal scales spotted like laterals; Cat. Nos. 9350, 9358, and 20811.
B. Lateral spots larger; dorsal spots forming a series on each row of scales; Cat. Nos. 4168, 5135, 5138, 5130, 5137, 9260, 9687, 12754, 12783, 13685, 14142, 16949; Mobile, Alabama, E. D. Cope; Cat. Nos. 4985, 9359.
C. Spots on three lateral rows; a median dorsal stripe, connected with lateral spots by cross-bands; Cat. No. 5322.
D. Three rows of lateral spots; no dorsal stripe, but large, brown, pale edged lateral dorsal spots; Cat. No. 14724. The spots are connected so as to form complete dorsal eross-bands in « specimen from Gotha, Orange County, Florida.
E. No dorsal stripes or spots; Cat. Nos. 6419, 13809.
II. Lateral spots confluent into stripes.
I’. Three lateral stripes, one dorsal stripe, and lateral dorsal spots. Nos. 1535, 1536, 1537, 18024.
G. Four lateral and one dorsal stripe; Cat. Nos. 3201, 5038.
H. Three lateral stripes and no dorsal; Cat. No. 11400. Two from Orange County, Florida, in the Milwaukee museum.
I. Three lateral and one dorsal stripe; Cat. Nos. 3193, 5129, 5131, 5089, 6078, 8972, 9357, 12048, 13383, 14076, 14515, 6073, 9360; Volusia, Florida, E. D. Cope; Wichita River, Texas, E. D. Cope; Dallas, Texas, I. D. Cope.
J. One lateral stripe and one dorsal; Cat. No. 10584.
K, One lateral stripe and no dorsal; Cat. No. 21359.
Besides the stripes mentioned under II, there is sometimes a feeble one on the superior row of abdominal scales. Many specimens also have vertical pale bars with a dark posterior border on the side of the body from the ear for a varying but not long distance posteriorly. Such are Cat. ae 8978, 3201, 5129, 9357, 6073, 5089, 6419, 5135, 5138, 5130, 9260, 12754, 12783, 13685.
It now Le to be ascertained what indications these variations in squamation and coloration present of specific or subspecific value. In the first place, it is to be observed that the greater number of individuals are grouped into two color types, which are marked in the above list by the letters B and I, or the checkered and the striped patterns, respectively. Do any other characters accord with these conspicuous color varieties? I quoted on a former occasion the manuscript remark of Professor Baird that the western variety of this species has but 14 rows of scales, as distinguished fiom the eastern type with 16 rows, and that he called the former by the subspecifie name of attenwatus.! I might have added that Professor Baird in his manuscript regarded the striped form as predominatingly western and the checkered type as eastern. Dr. Boulenger® has adopted this form as a distinet ae
' Bulletin a s. ational Maceure No. 17, 1880, } p18, * Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., II, p. 282. NAT MUS 98 32

cies, giving as a further definition that the ear opening is not larger than the nostril, while in the O. ventralis it is much larger. :
An examination of the localities from which the color varieties above mentioned were derived shows that no well-defined specimens of the checkered variety have been sent from west of the Mississippi River,
and that all from that region are striped. It shows, also, that the
striped coloration occurs also east of the Mississippi in Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, and that it is abundant in Florida. It also shows that the striped form is not characterized by a smaller number of scales than the checkered form, nor do the trans-Mississippians have even generally 14 rows of scales. Thus, I find in Cat. No. 9360, from Kansas, 16 rows; Cat. No. 4985, Arkansas, 16 rows; Cat. No. 3201, southwestern Texas, 16 rows; Wichita, Texas, E. D. Cope, 14 rows; Dallas, Texas, E. D. Cope, 16 rows. The size of the auricular meatus is very
variable. I have seen it as small as the nostril in only one specimen,
and that is Cat. No. 10584, from Clearwater, Florida, of the striped

variety, and with 16 rows of scales. In some specimens it is nearly as long as the eye slit; in many others it is only half as long, ete.
I do not find the subspecies attenuatus Baird, or species, according to Boulenger, to be well founded. The subspecies sulcatus Cope, from Dallas, Texas, stands on no better foundation. The interfrontonasal is broadly in contact with the frontal, but this character occurs in a good many others, both checkered and striped, and is variable in specimens from the same locality (Cat. No. 15537). ‘The second row of superciliary scales is represented by a half row in many specimens, and the one labial plate in the orbit is matched by Cat. No. 10584 from Clearwater, Florida. The carination of the scales is greater than usual, but the specimen is young and would have become, with age, as smooth as some of those before me. |
The only specimen which diverges widely enough from the type to require mention is Cat. No. 21359, which is, however, approached by Cat. No. 14724.
I give a more detailed description of an individual of the striped type.

The carination of the dorsal scales is confined chiefly to the two median rows, although it is obsoletely visible on ten rows on each side of these. There is a conspicuous broad, but shallow groove along the back between these ten median carine. The head is very narrow, as high as broad.
The ground color is a light olive green, or greenish gray above, with a median and five lateral (on each side) nearly equal stripes of dark brown (or sides brown with four narrow white lines). The median occupies the space between the dorsal carine. Then comes an olive stripe of 12 rows, and then a brown stripe. For the rest of the lateral series there is a narrow, well-defined stripe of whitish in the central fifth; the space between these lines is brown. These markings are equally distinct on the tail, which has the stripes continued a little below the level of those on the sides, though continuous with those above the lateral groove. Near the head the dusky lateral stripes are divided transversely by whitish lines, the sides of the head checkered likewise. The under parts are greenish white.
The predominance of the fourteen rows of scales in the lineated Western glass snake, in distinction from the sixteen of the mere checkered eastern form, appears to be well marked, at least in large specimens. This is the case with Cat. No. 3193, from St. Louis, and a small one from Knoxville, Tennessee, differing only in having the clay-colored stripe, on each side the dorsal brown one, 25 instead of 13 scales wide. The latter was associated with a large one of the Atlantic type, with sixteen series of scales.
I did not observe this species in southwestern Texas, but obtained it from near Dallas. The specimens are of the Western variety, with only fourteen rows of dorsal scuta, or the subspecies attenuatus of Baird. A specimen from the same locality is similar in the characters named, but is remarkable for the strong carination of its superior seales. The carine are elevated on the ten median rows, so as to leave sulci between them. On the posterior part of the body the keels extend to the lateral rows, and on the tail even to the inferior surface. There are only ten superior labial scuta, and no postparietals. The infracanthal row extends over the eye, giving three rows between the latter and the frontal plate. I am not sure that these characters are constant, so I note this form under the varietal name of sulcatus. It is described from a half-grown animal.
The osteology of this species has been described by Miiller,! Duméril and Bibron,? Cope® (scapular arch in part), Fiirbringer,! and Shufeldt.°

elements and limb are well figured by Miiller.’
The posterior limb rudi-
tion is good, but he overlooks the rudimental femur. This “glass snake” is a rapacious feeder, living principally on the
numerous Arthropoda which abound in the regions it inhabits.

OPHISAURUS VENTRALIS COMPRESSUS Cope.
This subspecies is founded on a single individual, Cat. No, 21359, from the coast of South Carolina. Were it not for the existence of a few specimens in a few respects intermediate between this form and the ordinary one, there could be no doubt of its full specific distinctness. Its characters are so peculiar that the least that can be accorded it is the rank of subspecies.
In the first place, the typical and only specimen has two interfrontonasal plates, one anterior to the other. This character is partly developed in only one other specimen, Cat. No. 10584, from Florida. Two labiai plates border the orbit below. These are separated by one or two rows from the orbit in all the specimens except in the type of the var. sulcatus from Dallas, Texas, where one labial enters the orbit. A marked peculiarity is the compression of the head, body, and tail. The body is higher than wide, and the dorsal surface is narrow roofShaped. The tail is more prominent on the middle line below than on the dorsal line, although the latter has not the flat character of other individuals. In fact this compression is
absolutely unique in the Fig. 90. genus, the typical vaCPHISAURUS VENTRALIS COMPRESSUS COPE. riety being flat-backed ae

throughout the length. Another peculiarity of this specimen is the narrowness of the caudal scales, which are longer than wide, conspicuously so beyond the basal region. ‘They are as wide as long, or even wider in the ordinary variety. The scales of the upper surfaces are in fourteen rows, of which only twelve are visible above the lateral fold. They are angulate roof-shaped, and are not keeled. There are only two rows of scales between the canthal row and the superior labials; in the ordinary form there are three. The prefrontals are broadly in mutual contact, as in a few other specimens, as Cat. No. 10584. The auricular fissure is about two-thirds the length of the eye fissure.
Cat. No, 21359, U.S.N.M.

<<<Page: 527>>>

Measurements.—Total length, 668 mm.; head and body, 185 mm.; to angle of mouth, 18 mm.
The coloration is also peculiar, as already pointed out in the color table, this specimen being the only example of group K. The ground color of the anterior half of the body above the lateral fold with the head above the mouth is black; each scale, except some of those of the vertebral line, with one or more white centers. No vertical bands anteriorly; cephalic plates with white spots on thin borders. From the middle of the length of the body the black rapidly fades to brown, and the light spots disappear, while the edges of the scales are paler than their centers. About the middle third of the length of the body a black stripe appears, which covers the adjacent halves of the third and fourth rows of scales above the lateral fold, and extends thence with sharply defined borders to near the end of the tail. Below this band the color is uniform straw colored. Belly, throat, and chin the same.
The only specimen which resembles this one in color is Cat. No. 10584, from Florida, already mentioned, which has one lateral stripe. But it has also a median dorsal stripe, and the anterior half of the body and head are straw colored, as in the striped forms generally.
It is only the existence of Cat. No. 10584 that has restrained me from regarding the form compressus as a distinct species. And that specimen has the normal form of body and tail and of scales. It is possible that that specimen is a hybrid between the two subspecies compressus and ventralis.

No lateral tegumentary fold. Digits 5-5. Prefrontal and interfrontonasal plates fused.
This genus is regarded as not distinct from Diploglossus by some authors. In the latter the interfrontonasal and the two prefrontals are not united, and the character is, in my estimation, amply sufficient to separate it from Celestus. The latter is related to it as Mesaspis is to Gerrohonotus, and both these genera exhibit the first stage of the fusion of cephalic plates which terminates in the simple condition seen in Anniella and other genera.

<<<Page: 528>>>

The greater number of species of this genus is West Indian, and no species has been found in continental South America. Three species occur in Central America, one of them, C. enneagrammus Cope, on the southern borders of the Mexican Plateau, and thus coming within the scope of this work; and two, C. bilobatus O’Shaughnessy, and C. cyanochloris Cope,! in the high mountains of Costa Rica. This genus is one of the few which occur in both the West Indian and Central American regions. The genus Diploglossus occurs in tropical South America and in southern Central America.

Dorsal scales striated, not keeled. Rostral not quite so wide as the genial. Interfrontonasal large, irregularly pentagonal. Frontal longer than wide. Frontoparietals present. Nasal scute in contact with the rostral. Two postnasals superposed. Two or three loreals, the anterior often obliquely divided. A preocular. A subocular. Mavxillary teeth with trilobate crowns. Trunk encircled with thirty-two to thirty-eight longitudinal series of scales, averaging thirty-six at the middle of the body. This species, like Diploglossus bilobatus, has the limbs well developed. It differs from that species in many particulars, especially in the shape of the cephalic plates.
Length of head from the end of the muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital plate equals about twelve dorsal scales, and is one-seventh of the distance between the chin and the cloaca. The second pair of supranasals (or prefrontonasals) are large and directed obliquely outward. ‘The interfrontonasal is wider than it is long and articulates with the posterior concave border of the frontal. Frontal relatively long, narrower in front than behind. Five supraoculars, of which the second is wide in front and is in contact along that side with the interfrontonasal. The nasal, somewhat lengthened, is pierced posteriorly. Postnasals small, quadrilateral, and superposed. Of the three loreals, the middle one, when present, is the largest, and is pushed upward on the muzzle, extending above the canthus rostralis and rarely reaching the labials. Postloreal square, followed by a small median preocular. Finally, the subocular represents a very long rectangle. The supralabials, ten on each side, of which the seventh and eighth, not so deep as the others, support the subocular seute; the ninth is small and pentagonal; the tenth, still smaller but similar in outline, is succeeded by scutella similar to those on the cheek, which extend to theear. Hight pairs of inferior labials. Rostral not quite so large as the genial. The

<<<Page: 530>>>

postgenial precedes three pairs of submaxillary plates, first pair of which are in contact along their internal sides.
The trunk is depressed, of medium length, covered with scales, which form thirty-four longitudinal series; the median dorsal series is composed of seventy-seven scutella, counting from the nape of the neck to the posterior level of the thighs. Scales on the under surface of the body smooth, but those on the back and sides are striated, having sixteen strive. Preanals are polygonal, not exceeding in size the ones which precede them. Scales of the normal region of the tail similar to those on the body; those on reproduced portions are distinctly keeled, forming by contact long prominent lines. Limbs relatively well developed; length of arm to the end of the middle finger more than one-third longer than the head. Toes of unequal length, the fifth of each foot being the longest.
Measurements.—Total length, 204 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 112 mmn.; length of tail, 92 mm.; length of head from the end of the muzzle to the posterior border of the occipital, 16 mm.; length of head from the end of the muzzle to the anterior border of the ear, 17 min.; length of head to the level of the temples, 13 mm.; length of arm to the extremity of the middle finger, 23 mm.; length of leg to the extremity of the longest toe, 30 mm.
General tint olive yellow; three wide, longitudinal, brown bands extend along the back and sides, the middle one, beginning at the muzzle to the anterior part of the tail, is distinguished from the two lateral by narrow lines of golden yellow, or, in young specimens, blue; its width comprises nine series of scales, each of which has the central longitudinal line. The lateral bands are thickly strewn on the neck and flanks with small yellow circular spots rimmed with dark violet, the effect being that of a black and yellow trellis. The dorsal scales have their borders brown. The cheeks and lower surfaces of the body are bright yellow, except the throat, which is of a pale tint of the same color.
Six specimens of this species are before me, all from the Orizaban district of the Toltecan subregion, except one from Costa Rica. (See chapter on geographical distribution.) All have two preloreals, one above the other, except one. In one of the former the supraloreal extends down to the superior labial plates between the pre-and postloreals on one side only, an evident anomaly. In the specimen with but one preloreal I proposed the species C. chalybeus. This specimen has apparently fewer longitudinal rows of scales than the others, but I find that the apparent number of scales depends on the locality in which they are counted. Thus the type of D. chalybeus has thirty-four rows on the posterior part of the body and forty on the anterior part. Other specimens display the same character. This explains the discrepancies in the figures given by authors. This species was first described from a young example from Jalapa in the museum of the Philadelphia Academy. Specimens in the museums of London and Paris are from the plateau of Guatemala.

wanting. Sphenoid and basioccipital separated by suture; descending tuberosities of the latter strong, compressed. Epipterygoid originating below opposite basipterygoid; above resting on anterior process of petrosal, and touching parietal just behind an obtuse descending angle of the deeurved border of the same. Subforaminal portion of petrosal shorter than supraforaminal portion, inclosing a very narrow downlooking groove. Basioccipital and exoccipitals coossified; condyle small, simple.
Meckel’s canal closed except distally, where it is open on the under side of the ramus. Coronoid developed anteriorly on external face of ramus, the dentary not reaching behind its anterior border. Splenial elongate, partly external; angular mostly external; surangular confluent with articular. Angle horizontal, incurved, with rounded border and concave superior surface.
Hyoid apparatus displays no second and rather short first ceratobranchials. Hypohyal rather long, the ceratohyal extending a little beyond its extremity, and widened at the posterior third. A free epibranchial, which has a bifurcate anterior extremity at that of the ceratohyal, and extends posteriorly but little behind the ceratobranchial.
Five cervical intercentra, and two cervicals besides atlas without ribs. The odontoid is coossified with the axis. Ribs extend to sacrum. Sacral diapophyses distinct from each other. Dorsal vertebrie without zygosphen, prezygapophyseal facets not continued on neural arch. Caudal diapophyses present; centraof middle region segmented through them; chevron bones intercentral. Neural spines low, higher on caudal region.
Suprascapula much larger than scapula; no proscapula. One large coracoid notch. Sternum without fontanelle, with three ribs and two attached to xiphoid rod.
lium without prominent angulus cristw; acetabulum entire; pubes uniting at an acute angle; pectineal angle medium. Ischia with prominent tuber. >
The detailed common characters of this genus will be found more fully among the specific description. The chief peculiarity is in the fold or strip of soft skin on each side, usually covered by the overlapping of the lower sheet on the upper. The dorsal scales are arranged in transverse series on each side, which pass a little obliquely backward on the back, so as to meet at an obtuse angle and not alwaysevenly. The Seales of the tail are in thick bony rings, easily separating, so that it is very rare to see a specimen which has not lost its tail and had it reproduced. In this case the indications of length afforded by the stump are very uncertain, and have given rise to grave errors in framing specific characters. It is probable that in none is it less than one and onehalf or one and three-fourth times the head and body.
In the North American species there are always twelve longitudinal rows of ventral scales, and fourteen to sixteen dorsal; the latter usually

<<<Page: 533>>>

carinated. The transverse series on each side vary from thirty-nine to fifty-two. The head plates are quite symmetrical; their general character will be found detailed under @. multicarinatus. The variations are in the size of the large median frontal and of the outer nasals; the number of the postnasals, whether two, three, or four; and the outer row of supraorbitals, whether three or two.
Young individuals are much more brilliantly colored than adults and have a more distinct color pattern of alternating light and dark crossbars. On young individuals were proposed the species G. cwruleus and G. webbii. The colors fade out with maturity in most of the species, becoming shades of olive or brown with lateral bars, or if brilliant colors are retained as in G. gramineus and G. auritus, the crossbars disappear.
There is considerable irregularity in the scales of the head in some of the species, which renders it necessary to analyze closely their homologies. Between the prefrontals and the internasals on each side of the median or interfrontonasal plate there may be one, two, or three plates. When there is one, it generally meets its mate of the opposite side in front of the interfrontonasal. This plate is the prefrontonasal. Sometimes, as G. auritus or G. liocephalus, there may be another pair of prefrontonasals, which may or may not meet in front of the interfrontonasal. In addition to these there may be another, generally smaller, plate, which lies between the interfrontonasal and loreal on each side, which I call the lateral prefrontonasal. This never meets its mate of the other side, but is sometimes fused on one or the other side with the prefrontonasal. On the side of the muzzle there may be one or two scales between the nasal and internasal, the supranasals. Posterior to the nasal there may be one or two plates in contact with it, one above the other, the postnasals. Immediately in front of the eyes there are two plates, one above and one below, the preoculars, which may rarely be fused. Between these and the postnasals,or nasals when postnasals are absent, is one or two plates, the anterior and posterior loreals. When there is but one plate between the nasal and the postloreal, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether it is the preloreal or the postnasal. In the case of G. burnettii I do not know which it is. It is probably preloreal, since in the allied G. multicarinatus the inferior postnasal is sometimes wanting.
The typical characters of the head plates are important as definitive of the species, but their variations render it necessary to rely on other characters. The Sonoran and Western forms are more difficult to distinguish than the Toltecan. I append the following key, which will aid in their determination:

Two pairssupranasals; the posterior (or prefrontonasals) longitudinal,
elongate, nearly equal to prefrontals; internasal smaller than fronto-
nasals. Five short supraoculars, embracing three or four smaller scales. Six superciliaries. Eleven supralabials, the eleventh continuous with
the swollen posterior temporal scales. Two postnasals, the smaller —
above the larger; one very large frenal, and one moderate preocular and three suboculars. Six in first, five in second row of infralabials. Muzzle not produced; plates of head thickened and roughened, especially enlarged on the temporal and occipital region. Dorsal scales in tweuty-three longitudinal series from nape to base of tail, and in thirteeen

longitudinal rows; in form twice as long as wide, thick, with an obtuse keel, roughened in old specimens, Abdominal scales in twelve and fourteen series, smaller than dorsals; lateral fold very weak, including a few granules mixed with larger scales. Extended limbs overlapping the posterior, reaching wrist or palm. Lengths of fingers, beginning with the shortest, 1, 5,2, 3,4; of toes the same. Four preanal plates, rather larger than the abdominals. Scales of superior surface of tail not more strongly keeled than dorsals.
Above, bright pea green, each transverse series of scales blackish at the base and yellowish at the tips; rugosities of all scales black. Below, pale green, with a reddish tint in some, gular region and lower jaw yellow, abruptly separated from the green of the neck; eyelids yellow.
Measurements.—Length of head and body, 105 mm.; length of head, inclusive of postoccipital plate, 27 mm.; width of head at temporal region, 23 mm.; length to axilla, 44 mm.; length of fore leg, 32 mm.; length of fore foot, 15 mm.; length of hind leg, 40 mm.; length of hind foot, 19 mm.; total length of smaller specimen, with tail, 215 mm.; length of tail of small specimen, 130 mm.
This species has been found so far only in the elevated forests of the region about the voleano of Orizaba or Citlaltepetl. Its coloration is handsome, and is calculated to conceal it in forest vegetation. The same style of coloration characterizes the Gerrhonotus auritus Cope, which inhabits similar situations on the plateau of Guatemala, While referring to this species I correct an error into which Boulenger has inadvertently fallen in describing this species. He distinguishes it from the Barissia jfimbriata Cope, which resembles it in the elongate yellow preauricular processes, by the presence of “ three pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral,” while the B. fimbriata has “ four pairs of shields.” Now the G. awritus has four pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral plates, and in my original description I stated that the second pair of internasals is divided—that is, there are two pairs of prefrontonasals. These, with the internasals, are exclusive
of the prefrontals. Gerrhonotus gramineus Cope.

border of the tympanum furnished with flat or slightly convex scales, One pair of prefrontonasals and two small supranasals. Nine to ten pairs of supralabials. Mental divided. Dorsal scales larger than the ventrals and slightly swollen longitudinally. Lateral fold inconspicuous. Tail of medium length. General color greenish yellow, with wide black transverse bands.
Head flat above, depressed in the occipital region, covered with scales having the surface finely rugose; length from the end of the muzzle to the middle of the auricular opening equaling seven or eight rows of dorsal scales, and entering four and one-third times into the space comprised between the chin and the anus. Muzzle short, having two internasal scutes and two small supranasals; the two internasals are in contact in front with the rostral, and on each side with the first supralabial; the two prefrontonasals, of much larger dimension, are hexagonal; the interfrontonasal, which is smaller, is quadrilateral and is in contact in front with the two preceding, and behind with the prefrontals. The supranasals, very small, are situated one to the right. the other to the left, between the preceding scutes and the nasal seale. The prefrontals are hexagonal and are smaller than the prefrontonasals, The frontal is relatively short, obtusely angled in front, with a sharp posterior angle, which is truncate at the extremity by the interparietal, which is rather large, and is in contact in front with the frontal and the frontoparietal, on each side with a large parietal, and behind with three very narrow occipitals. The latter are followed by two rows of convex nuchal scales. Each of the supraocular demicircles is protected by eight projecting scales (five large and three exceedingly small) and is bordered exteriorly by a series of fine superciliary scales, of which the first is more developed than the others. Nostril pierced in the posterior part of the nasal plate; this latter is subrectangular and is in contact before with one of the internasals; above with the supranasal and upper nasoloreal, below with the first two supralabial plates, and behind with the inferior postnasal.
The loreal scutellum is rhomboidal and rests on a part of the third and fourth supralabial; the second loreal is large and irregularly hexagonal; the preocular is subquadrilateral and precedes two suboculars. There are nine or ten supralabials; the first seven or eight are quadrilateral, the following, rather higher, is pentagonal, and the last, a long one, has a sharp angle directed backward; the nine pairs of inferior labials are well developed. Aperture of the ear triangular, overhung by the projecting temporals, and bordered in front by three or four small convex scales and behind by sealy grains. Mental divided and — succeeded on the right and left by four plates; those of the first pair in contact on their inner borders, and the outer borders of all separated from the inferior labials by one row of scales. The throat scales are flat and closely resemble those on the breast; on the sides of the neck — they are tubercular; but the region above, between the ear and arm, Is |

covered with fine granulations. Lateral folds well marked, each starting in front of the arm and terminating at the side of the cloaca. Dorsal scales subquadrilateral, surmounted by a slight longitudinal ridge, forming thirteen or fourteen longitudinal series and twenty-five to twenty-seven transverse ones from the nape of the neck to the posterior border of the thighs; the cervical series contain but four scales, and not six, as in G. teniatus. The ventral plates are quite small, and form fourteen longitudinal series at the middle of the trunk. Cloaca bordered with four scales, slightly larger than those which precede them. Tail one-third longer than the head and trunk, encircled with twenty-six whorls of seales. Limbs similar to those of G. teniatus, both in dimensions and scaling.
Measurements.—Total length, 250 mm.; length of head from end of muzzle to the middle of ear, 23 mm.; length of head to border of temples, 18 mm.; length of body from chin to anus, 111 mm.; length of tail, 139 mm.; length of arm to the extremity of the middle finger, 26 mm.; length of leg to the extremity of the longest toe, 32 mm.
General tint, a greenish yellow; on the neck and trunk are six transverse black bands, very wide on the upper parts, and narrow on the sides where they join and disappear on the belly. On the tail the bands are very wide above, and become faint, narrow lines on the under side. The top of the head is ocher yellow, but the small, tlexible protuberauces on the scales are dark brown. The sides of the neck, from the temporal region to the junction of the arm, are black; there are sinall black spots on the supralabials, another spot, starting behind the eye, extending obliquely backward and downward. Lower surfaces of the body yellow, and the bases of the abdominal scales blackish. °
M. Bocourt distinguishes this species from G. teeniatus by the following peculiarities: The temporal and nuchal plates are more prominent, and present the appearance of grains of maize; the lateral scales of the neck and throat are larger and tubercular, while on the region above, from the ear to the junction of the arm, the scales are small and granular; finally, the first cervical series is composed of four clevated scales, and not six flat ones. Giinther distinguishes it from the G. gramineus, with which Bocourt confounded it, by the following characters: The sides of the neck are covered with large irregular scales, separated from the nuchal scales by a naked span, with few granules; no granular scales in the lateral fold; dorsal scales considerably smaller, that is, in more numerous rows; ventrals smaller and more numerous,
Bocourt received this species from Mount Orizaba, where Sumichrast found it at an elevation of 3,000 meters. He also reports it from Oaxaca, whence also Giinther has it. No specimens contained in the U.S. National Museum.

Head flat on top; wide behind and covered in the temporal regions with convex scales. Nasal scute separated from the rostral. Upper edge of the tympanum bordered with granular scales. One pair of prefroutonasal plates, a pair of internasals, and a supranasal. Eleven or twelve pairs of supralabials. Mental divided. Dorsal scales showing a slight longitudinal swelling, and larger than the ventral plates. Lateral fold small. Tail of medium length. Color greenish gray, with transverse bands of dark green.
Head rounded in the temporal region and covered with finely rugose scales; length to the middle of the auricular opening equal to eight dorsal scales, and entering four times and a half into the space from the chin to the anus. Muzzle covered with seven scales; the two internasals in contact with each other and anteriorly with the rostral and on each side with the first supralabial. The prefrontonasal is larger and is hexagonal. The interfrontonasal is equally large, and is hexagonal and in contact vith six plates; in front with the prefrontonasals, behind with the two prefrontals, and on each side with the upper loreal plate, which in this species is recurved on the upper border of the muzzle. The supranasal is rectangular in outline, and is placed to the right and left above the nasal scute; the prefrontals are irregularly hexagonal, and each of them articulates behind with the frontal; the latter is relatively short, is obtuse-angled in front and sharply so at the back, with the point truncate and in contact with a narrow lozengeshaped interparietal. The latter is in contact with six scutes; in front with the preceding and with two frontoparietals, on each side with a large parietal, and behind with the occipital. The occipital is in contact, right and left, with a postparietal scale, and is followed by two ranks of nuchal scales. There are five supraocular plates, which embrace three or four smaller scales between themselves and the superciliaries. The temples are prominent and are covered with convex scales. Nostril opening pierced at the posterior part of the nasal plate; the latter in contact anteriorly with the first labial plate and wiih the internasal; above with a small supranasal, below with the second supralabial, and behind with two small superposed nasoloreals. These latter are in front of one loreal or two superposed, of which the top one is the smaller and is recurved on’ the upper face of the muzzle; the freno-ocular is large and irregularly hexagonal; the lower side, rather narrow, rests on the fifth supralabial; the subquadrilateral

<<<Page: 540>>>

preocular is followed by three small suboculars. There are eleven or twelve supralabials; the first nine quadrilateral; the sixth, which is the highest, in contact with the preocular; and the three last larger and pentagonal. Auricular opening triangular, overhung by the temporal region and bordered in front and above by granular scales. Inferior labials in nine pairs; mental divided and followed on the right and left by four submaxillary plates arranged as in G. deppii and separated from the inferior labials by a row of longitudinal scales. The throat is covered with scales similar to those on the breast; those on the sides are smaller, and the region between the ear and the arm is covered with granular scales. Lateral fold slightly indicated, comnencing on each side in front of the arm and ending at the cloaca. Dorsal scales subquadrilateral, with a slight longitudinal swelling, and forming fifteen longitudinal series, and from twenty-eight to twentynine transverse ones from the nape of the neck to the posterior border of the thighs; the cervical series are composed of six scales. Abdominal plates small, constituting twelve longitudinal rows; the anal region is bordered with six scales, of which the lateral ones are very small. ‘Tail a little longer than the body and head and with eightyfive rings of smooth scales. Limbs relatively longer than those of G. deppii, but covered with similar scales. Claws short and hooked.
Measurements.—Total length of type specimen, figured by Wiegmann, 216 mm.; length of head, from end of muzzle to middle of ear, 20 mm.; width of head at the borders of the temples, 16 mm.; length of body, from chin to anus, 88 mm.; length of tail, 128 mm.; length of arm, to the end of the middle finger, 24 mm.; length of leg, to the end of the longest toe, 28 mm.
Neck and trunk a bright green with seven transverse brown bands, which are a little wider on the vertebral region than on the sides. The tail has fifteen bands of the same color. The upper surface of the head shows the color deepened to a greenish gray, and the temples are crossed obliquely by a black band, The inferior regions are yellow.
M. Bocourt, from whom the preceding description is mainly taken, remarks concerning this species ‘that in general appearance it resembles greatly G. deppii, from which, however, it is distinguished by the following characters: (1) Dorsal scales are not so large, somewhat Swollen, constituting fourteen and not eleven longitudinal, less converging series; (2) two loreals, the upper slightly recurved on the muzzle; (3) different coloration, especially less brilliant.”
A single specimen from Orizaba in the national collection agrees in every respect with the description of Bocourt except in the number of dorsal scales. Of these there are twenty-five transverse series and Seventeen longitudinal. As the inferior row is composed of two scales to each single scale of a cross-row, perhaps they should not be counted; which leaves fifteen longitudinal rows. There is no superior loreal as in

Wiegmann’s type, but the interfroutonasal is entirely inclosed by the prefrontonasals and prefrontals, as in the second specimen from the Berlin collection described by Bocourt. There are only four preanals,

This handsome species is widely distributed in eastern and central Mexico, where it is represented by three well-marked subspecies, which may yet come to be regarded as true species.

The single specimen of this subspecies exhibits peculiarities of cephalic plates which, if constant, will at once separate it from all other known North American Gerrhonoti. The head is depressed, running forward to an acute point; pyramidal; the length two-thirds the width, which is five-sevenths the length to ear, which in turn is rather more than onefifth (about two-ninths) the head and body. The mouth is unusually pointed and depressed. The difference in the cephalic plates from those

of G. multicarinatus appear to be caused by the development of three additional plates just back of the rostral, and the unusual size and more superior position of the upper posterior postnasal. The three supplementary rostral plates are all in contact anteriorly with the rostral; the median largest, separating the anterior pair of internasals, and in con| tact behind with the two posterior internasals which are in apposition. The lateral supplementary plate separates the nasal entirely from contact with the rostral and the first labial, the nasal being restricted to the second labial. The posterior pair of internasals is large; longer than broad; bounded externally by the displaced anterior internasal and the upper first postnasal. The upper second postnasal is very large and on the canthus rostralis; almost entirely on tho upper surface of the head. The frontal is hexagonal and encircled by six plates, in front by the posterior internasals, laterally by the upper posterior postnasal (as large as the lower), and behind by the postfrontals; of these the latter are rather largest, the others nearly equal. The usually single loreal is replaced by four small plates, the anterior upper largest; the posterior upper smallest; the two lower square, equal, and forming a kind of border to the upper labials. There are nine labials to the posterior infraorbital, instead of eight. The supraorbital plates are five and three.
The general color above is a dull, light greenish or true olive, with about seven obscure bands across the back and sides between head and tail, covering a width of some two scales. On the sides some of the seales adjacent to these dusky bars (not always the posterior ones) are edged with dull clayey whitish. The tail is scarcely varied anteriorly, only there are some traces of the whitish edges. The under parts are light yellowish, obscurely marbled with the ground color of the back. The head is entirely uniform olive, except below.
The lateral blotches are somewhat peculiarly constituted. The pattern is as if there were one vertical row of scales of a plain dark brown, and another behind this of the lighter ground color edged with whitish, the two then broken midway and the lower half transposed, so that on one row the lower scales are whitish, the upper brown; while in that posterior to it the lower are brown, the upper whitish; the succession below being thus white and brown, and above brown and white. The perfectly plain intervals cover about four rows.
This lizard occurs throughout the first plateau country of Texas from the Rio Grande to the Red River. It has been found on the Helotes Creek by Mr. Marnock, and in Wichita County by Mr. Boll. I did not See it living; it is rather rare, and is said to inhabit rocky places. There is no evidence of its occurrence outside of Texas in the United States. It is not known to occur within the proper limits of the Sonoran subregion, but is common in the Tampican subregion of the Central American region of the neotropical realm. It must be regarded as an invader from that realm, but it ranges much farther north than any of the other forms of that fauna.

Elgaria nobilis BArRD and GIRARD, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., V1, August, 1852, p129; Fort Webster, New Mexico.
Body slender, very small, much depressed. Tail two and one-fifth times the head and body. Dorsal scales in fourteen longitudinal and fifty-eight oblique series; sixty-two from chin to anus. Tail with 131 whorls. Scales all entirely smooth, or the middle dorsal rows with a very blunt obsolete carination. Frontal plate rhomboidal; large, separating the internasals from the postfrontals. Two pairs of internasals and two of postnasals. Supraorbitals in seales of 5 and 3. Hind leg from knee equal to distance from snout to ear, which is one-fifth the head and body.
Ground color light yellowish olive; back with ten broad bars (three seales wide) edged behind with a 22: black, having a whitish marGERRHONOTUS skiers AND GIRARD. gin posteriorly. Tail with pea thirty half rings of the Cat, No, 8768, U.S.NM. same, changing behind into blotches. Sides with narrow black bars, on a light ground. Beneath greenish white, each scale spotted with blackish.
The frontal plate of this species is smaller than in many others of the section, although it separates the posterior internasals from the postfrontals, the gap between them filled up by the upper posterior postuasal. It is quite probable, however, that occasionally the posterior internasals and the postfrontals may come into actual contact, as the former are considerably longer than in G. multicarinatus. I do not perceive any other special peculiarities in the cephalic plates. The

head is pointed and depressed; the height scarcely two-thirds the width, which is rather more than two-thirds the head to the ear. The tibial joint is very short; all the limbs unusually feeble; the fore legs extended forward do not reach to the eye, while in G@. multicarinatus it reaches to the nostrils.
The upper parts are of a light yellowish olive; the back with about ten transverse broad bars covering two or three rows of scales; the tail with about twenty-nine or thirty of the same. These are of a darker, more reddish olive than the ground color, suffused with brownish black behind, less conspicuously in front and the interval spotted with dark brown. They are margined posteriorly (on the edges of scales) with clayey white. Several of those along the middle of the back are broken above and the branches displaced or alternating. On the sides the posterior black border of the dorsal bars with their whitish edging is continued down to the fold on a single scale. There is almost nothing of this, however, on the side of the tail, except a slight shade of the lighter portion. The sides of the same are marked alternately with seven or eight olive and white spots, the former edged before and behind with black. The plates of the head above are blotched with dark brown. There is no trace of a dusky wash along the sides. The under parts are olivaceous white, each scale, except along the middle of chin and throat, with a biack spot. |
Dr. Boulenger identifies this species with the G. (Hlgaria) kingii Gray (G. multifasciatus of Dumériland Bibron). He, however, describes that species! as having six or eight median dorsal series of scales, keeled, which is not the case with the G. nobilis.

Two pairs of internasals and two of postnasals, the hinder pair sometimes fused into one. Frontal separating widely the postfrontals and internasals. Supraorbitals in two series of five and three. Head very broad and swollen behind, where the width is more than two-thirds length to ear. Hind feet from knee equal or a little greater than this distance. Tail two and one-fourth to two and one-half times the head and body (in Cat. No. 3102a).
Dorsal scales in fourteen transverse and forty-seven to fifty longitudinal series. Seales all prominently carinated, the carine equidistant; scales on anterior as well as upper face of limbs showing more or less carination, as also the sides of the tail.
Color above yellowish brown or gray, with a series of ten to fourteen blackish rings, continued quite distiuetly across the back, and spotted behind with white even in the median region.
This is a variable species, so much so as to have given rise to a number of synonyms. It was first described from a young specimen by Wiegmann as G@. ceruleus, a name which is absolutely erroneous as applied to the species in general. Another young individual gave rise to the synonym G, webbii Baird.
In this species the body is cylindrical or subquadrate, rather depressed; the belly flattened. There is a decided constriction at the neck; the head as wide as the body, a little broader than high; the width two-thirds the distance from muzzle to ear, which again is two ninths the head and body. The tail is excessively lengthened, two and one-third times the head and body, though frequently much shorter owing to the breaking off and reproduction in a stump of the tail. This is shaped like the body, though less depressed; and without the soft skin of the sides, though with a shallow groove. The feet are short and feeble.
On each side the body is a fold or strip of soft skin paved at intervals with small oval scales, with still smaller ones between them, especially on the sides. This begins at the ear and extends backward to the root of the tail, the legs being implanted in it. On the sides it

<<<Page: 547>>>

is about one-fifth the width of the belly sheet and is generally concealed by the folding of the latter over the sides of the dorsal. The two lateral strips of soft skin separate a dorsal and ventral sheet or plate which are very stiff and firm, the former rather broader than the latter. The scales on the sheets are arranged in transverse series, the dorsal, however, with a slightly backward direction on the median line.
The scales on the tail are regularly whorled. The plates on the head are large and regular. There is a long narrow vertical, concave on each side, wider behind (where it is truncated and three sided) than before,
i where it is two sided and obtuse h angled. There are two postBeck frontals, a frontal, and two pairs
of short, broad internasal plates to the rostral. The frontal is broad, rhomboidal, truncate laterally, and separates evenly the postfrontals and _ internasals. There is a large inner supraorbital series of five plates, with a smaller of three in its external concavity. It is bordered externally on the upper edge of the head by six plates. The nostrils are lateral in a single plate next to the first and second labials, with two small plates behind it, sueceeded by a third postnasal, in most specimens divided into two; next comes a large loreal and a smaller anteFig. 93. orbital to the eye. There are GERRHONOTUS MULTICARINATUS BLAINVILLE ten upper labials and nine or 4 ten lower. Theinfraorbitals are eee two; the postorbitals in two successive series of three and four small plates; then comes four vertical series to the ear. There are three median occipital plates in line with the vertical (sometimes only two), anterior largest, and three plates on either side larger than the rest. The distinction between plates of head and neck is, however, very slightly marked. Above it may be known by the transition from the single occipital plate to the double dorsal series. There is a very slight tendency only to imbrication in the cephalic plate. The scales in the dorsal sheet are all conspicuously carinated, the upper ones very obtusely mucronate. There are fourteen ridges and rows of scales on the dorsal plate, all the scales quite equal in size,
Cat. No. 7909, U.S.N.M.

<<<Page: 548>>>

about forty-eight from occiput to above anus. There is no median dorsal ridge or row of scales, the scales forming an even number. There are about one hundred and thirty-six series of whorls or scales on the tail, all carinated except on the under surface. On the belly sheet are twelve series of scales, which are about as wide, but rather shorter than the dorsal, and consequently the whorls not continuous all around the body as they are on the tail. There are about sixty-three series of scales from the chin to the anus, about nineteen or twenty of them belonging to chin and throat. The lower labials are margined internally by a series of wider plates, and these again by a series three times their width.
The legs are weak and covered with overlapping scales, those on the inner surface smaller. The posterior surface of the thighs and humerus is like that of the lateral fold. The scales on the upper and anterior surface of the legs are carinate; those in the soles are smooth and tubercular. The digits on each foot are all unequal except the third and fourth, which are nearly equal and longest. The hind leg is but little longer than the fore; the forefoot about two-thirds the hinder.
The scales are all hard and bony plates, very firm and distinct, covered by a thin epidermis.
The cephalic plates are quite smooth in the young. With age they become wrinkled longitudinally, and the posterior extremities more angular, elongated, and imbricate. The upper parts are barred with a succession of reddish, black, and pale yellowish rings in such a manner as to render it difficult to say what is the ground color. There are about twelve narrow black rings on a single whorl from head to tail (and thirty-six or more on the tail). Each is bordered behind by grayish or yellowish white, usually on the edges of the same scale. These rings of black and white, though usually only the width of a single whorl, are not entirely regular, passing sometimes from one whorl to another. Anterior to the black the color is sometimes quite deep red, sometimes light brown, passing gradually forward to the next ring into light olive gray. The under parts are light greenish olive, the edge of the scales paler.
The red of the dorsal intervals usually fades in a whorl to a shade of brownish olive. The light edging to the black often tinges the base of the scales behind it and has much the character of specks of thick white-lead paint.
The supposed differences between this species and E. scincicauda disappear on comparison of a large series of specimens. Some from Monterey, California, agree with the types in the very thick head, but the coloration being perhaps more like that of the types of the supposed G. scincicauda.
The common Gerrhonotus of northern California is very closely related to that found at San Diego, and although a comparison of a large series conveys a general impression of difference, they are not capa

<<<Page: 549>>>

ble of exact and intelligible definition. The northern form, on the whole, is smaller, with a shorter tail, and decidedly more slender head and body. The scales are smaller, as shown by an average of 51 in a series instead of 47. They are less prominently carinated, especially on the arms and legs.
The color appears to differ in the more indistinct dorsal bands, which are usually more or less effaced along the back, where they also lack the distinct white specks bordering the black behind.
The form called G. grandis is distinguished from the types of G. multicarinatus by its greater smoothness, the absence of white spots on the back, and the more uniform olive-brown color.
It is smoother than the types of G. scincicauda, the hind legs a little longer, the scales smaller, the frontal shorter, the tail apparently longer. The coloration is very different, being of a uniform clear brown olive, with dusky bars shading gradually into paler below, and sharply spotted on the sides with white. It is not, however, distinguishable, in my opinion, trom the typical forms either as species or subspecies.
A specimen from Fort Tejon (Cat. No. 4129) differs quite decidedly from the types in having the head and body narrower and more elongated; the head to ear is not one fifth the head and body. The width of the head is not two-thirds the distance from snout to ear, which is one-fifth the head and body. There are 52 scales in a line from occiput to above anus, and 63 from chin to anus. The ridges of the scales on the sides are quite obsolete; those on the legs perfectly smooth, except a few faint indications on the upper edge. The legs are very feeble, the distance from the knee to the end of toes being equal to that from snout to ear; from elbow to end of claw is four-fifths this distance. There are about thirteen bands from head to anus. The bands on the back are more distinct and a good deal spotted behind with white.
The geographical range of the Gerrhonotus multicarinatus is the Pacific district from Puget Sound to San Diego, California, and as far as the southern extremity of the Lower Californian peninsula, According to Mr. T. S. Palmer, the present form is confined to the chaparral belt. Stejneger is of the opinion that the Cape St. Lucas form is specifically distinct from the Californian, but I have not been able to substantiate the difference. He uses for the latter the name G. scincicauda Skilton.

GERRHONOTUS MULTICARINATUS PALMERII Stejneger.
Gerrhonotus multicarinatus palmerit STEJNEGER, North American Fauna, No. 7, Pt. 2, 1893, p. 196. Dr. Stejneger describes this species as follows: Similar to G. scincicauda, but body much less elongated and coloration above essentially different, being, according to age and sex, either uniform dark olive brown with numerous black and white dots on the sides, or pale bluish drab clouded
with numerous ill-defined and irregular blotches of brownish drab, blotches not arranged in cross bands.

<<<Page: 551>>>

The general aspect of this form is strikingly different from all the other Californian Gerrhonoti, and this difference is equally well marked in the youngest specimen and in the oldest. I have before me a nearly unbroken series of ten specimens, from a very young one, with a body only 40™™ long, up to the dark old males, and none of them can for an instant be mistaken for the typical G. scincicauda from the lower valleys. The whole figure is shorter and more thick set, and the broad and rather distant cross bands on the back are conspicuously abrupt, the coloration being either uniform dark or else an ill-defined, often obscure, ‘pepper-and-salt’ mixture. Only in one specimen (No. 18612) is there a more definite arrangement of the light and dark spots, but these ill-defined cross bands are much more numerous than in G. scincicauda, being about fifteen on the back (between anterior and posterior limbs) as against nine to ten in the latter. A similar pattern may also be traced in the youngest specimen referred to (No. 18613), with a similar result.
Most of the Gerrhonoti brought home by the Death Valley expedition belong to this form, of which there is no specimen in the Museum collection from any definite and undoubted locality before, and all the specimens of the expedition were collected in a comparatively small area near the headwaters of the Kern, Kings, and Kaweah rivers, at an altitude of from about 7,000 to 9,000 feet above the sea,
It might seem strange that there should be no name available among the many defunct synonyms of Californian Gerrhonoti by which to distinguish this form, but the fact seems to be that most of the specimens so far brought to the notice of herpetologists have been collected in the lower altitudes, while the present form seems to be restricted to the higher altitudes of the Sierra.

Scales, but a fifteenth is seen at intervals along the dorsal line, and there should really be a sixteenth. The cheek scales are smooth, those on the upper edge of the legs faintly carinated. The surface of the head is slightly arched or convex; the plates not very smooth. The four internasals are large, in two rows, which are as long as broad. The frontal is very small, rhomboidal; completely embraced between the postfrontals behind and the posterior row of internasals before, which are in contact, a very peculiar feature. There are but two postnasals and a large loreal. The hinder feet from knee are equal to distance from snout to ear; the forefeet from elbow are a little less,
The ground color is a light greenish gray or ash, with a series of about twelve vertical black bars, spotted with white, on each side, the bar the width of a single scale, but sometimes passing from one to another.

The peculiarities of this species are its very small interfrontonasals, two postnasals only, the indication of a fifteenth dorsal row of scales, the greenish-ash color, without transverse dorsal bands, and with the blackish instead of white dorsal series.
In the type specimen (Cat. No. 4132) there are forty-eight rows of scales on sixteen transverse series. The interparietal is very small and elongate rhomboidal. The frontal is rather larger, but its general characters the same.
A series of ten specimens from Fort Point, near San Francisco, differ. slightly, though probably the same as H. formosa. They are rougher and more sharply carinated on the back. The head is nearly as deep as broad; the width, however, scarcely two thirds the length (thus narrower). The legs are short; the anterior from the elbow about threefourths the distance from snout to ear, or decidedly less than in the type; the hinder from knee about equal to this distance. The snout to ear is about two-ninths in the head and body, or a little longo in proportion.
The interparietal is narrow, lozenge-shaped. The interfroutonasal, though large, is embraced between or encircled by the two postfrontals and the two post-internasals, which are long. Anterior to the frontal is a smaller median plate in contact with it and the rostral, and separating the anterior internasals; this, however, is probably not regular, If constant it will establish the species. There are two small postnasals and three large outer supraorbitals, besides the five on the external edge, as in the type.
There are sixteen dorsal series of scales, all about of equal width, and the scales in the upper edge of the soft fold just below this are decidedly _ larger than those of the others. The dorsal ridges are all very distinct and well defined, most conspicuous on the back, where they almost form amucro. The scales on the upper part of the cheeks and those on the back and sides of neck are distinctly carinated, as are those on the upper edge of the limbs and on the tail, except on the lower surface.
There are about fifty-one scales from occiput to tail and sixty“two” from chin to anus. This is an appreciably greater number than in the type, and is worthy of consideration. 4
The ground colors in this are of an olivaceous reddish gray. There — is a dorsal stripe of six and two half scales wide, lighter than the ground color, becoming still lighter, turning almost into a white stripe externally. On each side below this light space are about fourteen approximately vertical but rather broken black bars, sharply margined behind with white, each a single scale in width. On the back, and connecting these lateral bars, is a series of fifteen transverse dusky ones, slightly concave anteriorly, but rather irregular. The suborbitals are black, edged below with white; the labials are black and white. The under parts are greenish white. There is no white whatever on the back.

<<<Page: 554>>>

This variety is readily distinguishable from FH. principis by the much rougher scales, and the equality of the lower lateral scales to those above them, as well as by its more compressed body, two postnasals, and the white edges to the lateral scales. It is very similar to the type specimens of H. formosa, having the sixteen rows of scales above and the two postnasals. The chief difference is in a greater number of seales in a dorsal series (51), narrower head and shorter fore legs, and the ground color brownish olive instead of greenish ash, with a series of fifteen transverse dorsal bars instead of thirteen or fourteen spots.
In his report of the Deatlr Valley expedition, Dr. Stejneger states that—
This form is only distantly related to G. multicarinatus, but very closely to G. principis, so close, in fact, that I believe that the name of the latter will become reduced to a trinominal when the geographical distribution of the two forms shall have been ascertained in all its details. G. burnettii is now known to occur along the coast at least from Monterey to Humboldt Bay. How far inland it extends its range, and how and where it meets or grades into G. principis is as yet undeterminable. One thing is certain, however, and that is, that the range of G. burnettii and G. multicarinatus overlap considerably, and in this fact alone I see sufficient proof of their specific distinctness. The differences between them are certainly due neither to sexual, nor to seasonal, nor to individual variation, great as the latter is in the Gerrhonoti.

Dorsal rows of scales sixteen, the lowest about half that adjacent to it. Ventral rows twelve. Frontal very small, lozenge-shaped, completely surrounded by the post-internasals and prefrontals; nearly equal in size. Two postnasals, the upper sometimes confluent into one. Supraorbitals 5 and 2. Scales obsoletely carinated; nearly smooth on the head, neck, sides of body (lowest rows), and of tail, as well as on legs. Hind feet from heel longer than from snout to ear; width of head two-thirds this amount. Forty-eight scales from head to tail. Tail nearly twice the head and body.
Above light brownish olive; the sides with obscure darker vertical bars, broken up into spots and without white edges behind. A median row of 16 or 18 dark spots, representing as many bands on the sides. Beneath greenish yellow white.

<<<Page: 555>>>

Body much depressed and unusually smooth. Head much depressed, the depth about three-fourths the width, or less, the width more than two thirds the distance from snout to ear; occipital lozenge-shaped; vertical lengthened; frontal small, completely embraced by the postfrontals and post-internasals in contact and of about equal size. Two pairs of postnasals. Inner large supraorbitals usually four, embracing two in their concavity, not three. Fore legs from elbow rather less, hinder from knee rather more, than the distance from snout to ear, which is from one-fourth to one-fifth the head and body. The tail is not quite twice the latter distance. There are sixteen longitudinal rows of dorsal seales, the lowest about half that adjacent to it. There are about 48 scales from head to tail above, 55 from chin to anus. The scales are everywhere remarkably smooth; the carination quite inappreciable on the back, though each scale is slightly and obsoletely keeled. On the sides this does not extend to the posterior edge, and it is wanting on the lowest row. All the plates of the head and neck, as well as of the limbs, are smooth or with an inappreciable trace of carination.
This species is distinguished from G. burnettii likewise, by having sixteen rows of scales above, by the possession of four postnasals (although sometimes the two upper are fused into one long one, leaving three) instead of two. This lengthens the muzzle, which is more depressed. There are only two outer supraorbitals instead of three. The lower row of lateral seales is only half as large as the next instead of nearly equal to it. The carination is much more obsolete, being entirely wanting in the back of the neck, and in some other regions distinctly keeled in G. burnettii. The body is much more depressed.
This species is of a light reddish, olive brown, the sides for about four or five rows of scales blotched with dusky, nearly black above, and not constituting distinct regular vertical bars; the remnant of a continuous lateral stripe from the snout, and least effaced above. The back has an irregular median series of rounded dusky blotches, sprinkled more distantly elsewhere. There are traces of sixteen or eighteen of the lateral and dorsal dark blotches. The under parts are yellowish white, with a tinge of greenish. The edges of the cephalic

plates are suffused with dusky. These are only bletches. Norings on the tail.
There is generally no indication of white edges to any of the scales; in one or two specimens only is there an occasional and faint trace of this.

ing scales are prominent. ‘The occipital scute is in contact with seven obtusely keeled scales; in front with the parietal and the two interparietals, on each side with an accessory occipital, and behind with two roof-shaped nuchal scales. Each of the subocular regions contains seven plates of unequal dimensions, with four superciliary plates on the exterior border. Nostril pierced in the medioposterior part of the nasal plate, which is in contact in front with the internasal, and above with the superior postnasal; posteriorly with the inferior postnasal, and below with the two first supralabials. A large loreal scute which is wider above than below, and articulates in front with the postnasals, above with one of the prefrontonasals, with a prefrontal and with a supraocular; behind with the preocular, and on the basal side, which is narrow, with a part of the fourth supralabial. The preocular, much smaller than the loreal, is irregularly quadrilateral; is followed by two or three subocular scutes, the last one of which is generally very long. Ten supralabials; the first seven subquadrilateral, the two following pentagonal, and the last one, well developed as to length, terminates ina point. Cheek scales angular and flat. Ear-aperture triangular, bordered in front with two or three small convex scales, and behind with scaly grains. The postgenial scute is sometimes simple, but more frequently itis divided and followed by four pairs of large submaxillary plates; the first pair of these only are in contact on their inner sides; the other are separated on their external borders from the inferior labials by a row of scales. Lateral fold strong, having scaly grains Similar to those on the sides of the neck; it begins beneath the ear and ends at the side of the cloaca.
Dorsal scales large and subrhomboidal; they form twelve to fourteen longitudinal series, and thirty-five to thirty-seven transverse ones from the auditory aperture to the posterior border of the thighs; in the dorSal region they are strongly keeled, and more or less prolonged to a point, and the keels united form six prominent lines. On the flanks these scales are smooth or slightly rounded; the first transverse series on the neck is composed of eight scales roughly keeled. The ventral plates are shorter, forming twelve longitudinal rows. Tail rounded quadrangular at base, rounded the rest of its length, very tapering at the end, and much longer than the head and trunk combined; it is encircled, when complete, by one hundred whorls of keeled scales, the keels forming prominent lines. Anus bordered with four scutella. Seales of the upper part of the anterior limbs larger than those on the under side; the reverse is found on the posterior limbs; toes covered above and below with well-developed scutella; claws short and hooked. Total length of a type specimen with perfect tail, according to Deppe, 177 mm.; from chin to anus, 87 mm.; tail, 90 mm.
Measurements.—Total length, 330 mm.; length of head from end of muzzle to the middle of ear, 26 mm.; width of head at the borders of the temples, 18 mm.; length of body trom chin to anus, 120 mm.;

<<<Page: 559>>>

length of tail, 210 mm.; length of arm to the end of the middle finger, 29 mm.; length of leg to the end of the longest toe, 35 mm,
The two type specimens sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters are olivaceous above and greenish gray on the sides; they present no trace of transverse or longitudinal bands. Head dotted with yellowish white points, which cut the posterior or lateral edges of the scales. This light color is also seen on the lips and on the subocular region. Lower surfaces pale yellow, shaded to a greenish tint on the throat and on the sides of the belly.
Professor Dugés' gives the following color variations of this species:
The typical coloration is brown above and yellow below, with the skin of the lateral fold pale greenish. Varying from this type, the lateral region above the fold becomes striped with brown-green or drab, a lighter band above a darker one. The color of the fold may be cross-banded with darker, and the dorsal region marked with transverse or rounded brown spots on a greenish on yellowish ground. Or the dorsal region may be uniform brown with pale blue spots, each with a dark blue center, and the fold band be blue spotted. The last pattern indicates the var. lichenigerus (G. lichenigerus Wiegmann). According to Dugés there may be either one or two loreals.
Duges says that this species is less vivacious and irascible than the G. liocephalus, but that when it bites, it does so with much force. It is readily domesticated; then comes to take its food from the fingers. It eats all kinds of living insects, and swallows them by movements of the throat muscles like those made by snakes. ‘I have seen it,” he says, ‘‘eat full-grown Scelopori of the species S. scalaris and S. grammicus, occupying about ten minutes in the operation. The country people believe them to be poisonous, an opinion which it is unnecessary to contradict; but I know from repeated experiences that when they bite they draw blood, and they do not easily let go.”
Dugés further remarks that in the valley of Mexico the Barissia imbricata is found about the acequias, but in the State of Guanajuato it only occurs in the mountains, where the winter is tolerably severe. It is also found in the Orizaban district, as Mr. W.S. Blatchley? states that he found it at an elevation of 11,000 feet on Mount Orizaba, and I have three specimens from Lacuatipan, Hidalgo from Dr. Santiago Bernard. According to Dugés it is also found in Michoacan.

BARISSIA LEVICOLLIS Stejneger.
Barrissia levicollis STEINEGER, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., XIII, 1890, p. 184. The following is Dr. Stejneger’s description of this species:
No azygos prefrontal; three pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral; prefrontals not in contact with loreal; no projecting scales above the ear; one large upper postorbital and two minute lower ones; forty-six transverse rows of dorsal scales between the head and the base of the tail, and sixteen longitudinal rows; head shields swollen. Head narrow, snout long, pointed; head shieldsswollen; two pairs of internasals, the posterior in contact with anterior supraocular; one pair of prefrontals; nasal separated from rostral; a supranasal; a postnasal; a loreal, pentagonal, not higher than wide, and separated from prefrontals; a preorbital; two suborbitals, the posterior very long; one very large upper postorbital and two minute lower ones; ten and twelve supralabials; sides of neck covered with granular scales; lateral fold, commencing below the ear opening; nuchal scales not keeled, in ten longitudinal rows; dorsal scales of medium size, in sixteen longitudinal rows,
Fig. 96. BARRISSIA LEVICOLLIS STEJNEGER. ll. Cat. No. 9682, U.S.N.M.
the four median obtusely keeled, the next two on each side with the keels still less pronounced and the remainder smooth; forty-six transverse dorsal rows; ventrals smaller than dorsals, in twelve longitudinal rows; . .
Color (in alcohol) above uniform ‘‘ tawny-olive” with interrupted transverse bands of black dots on the sides, the scales with the dots being margined posteriorly, more or less distinctly, with whitish; under side dull pale clay-color, with irregular black dots on flanks and throat.
Measurements.—F rom snout to vent, 121 mm.; from snout to ear opening, 27 mm.; from snout to fore limb, 38 mm.; from axilla to groin, 67 mm.; greatest width of head, 18 mm.; fore limb, 27 mm.; hind limb, 24 nm.
Unfortunately, the exact locality where the type of this species was collected is not known; all that the record book contains is “ Mexican Boundary.” It was evidently obtained by one of the surveying parties of the United States and Mexican Boundary, but the original number

<<<Page: 561>>>

having become obliterated, it was reentered in 1877 and the original label—or what remained of it—destroyed.
The present species belongs to the same group as the foregoing, haying “three pairs of shields between the frontal and the rostral,” or in other words, “two pairs of internasal scuta.” It differs from B, imbricata, however, in the greater number of dorsal rows, both longitudinal and transverse; in the obsolete carination of the dorsal scales; in the exclusion of the loreal from the prefrontals; in the smaller size and — greater number of the temporals, and in the narrower and more elongated shape of the head. It has the sixteen longitudinal rows of dorsals in common with B. planifrons Bocourt, but the head shields are swollen and the other characters which separate it from B. imbricata also distinguish it from B. planifrons. B. rudicollis is still farther removed by the low number of the transverse dorsal rows, the strong carination of the nuchal shields, and the contact of the nasal with the rostral.
A Barissia olivacea was described by Baird in 1858! as North American, but Stejneger shows that the locality is uncertain, and that it is the B. imbricata Wiegmann of Mexico.

Supranasals small, separated in my specimen by a small azygous plate, which is not present in Bocourt’s specimens. There are two pairs of prefrontonasals on the top of the muzzle; the first pair are small, and in the specimen sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters, these two scales are abnormally spaced from each other, and from their position could easily

be mistaken for the supranasals, which are still smaller. Those of the third pair are more developed, are almost of the dimensions of the pretrontals in Bocourt’s specimen, but smaller in mine. The latter are pentagonal and articulate with the anterior angle of the frontal. The frontal is larger behind than before, equal in length to the distance from its anterior extremity to the end of the muzzle. The interparietal large and elongate-hexagonal, in contact with the abbreviated point of the preceding scale, and with the two frontoparietals; on each side with a parietal, and behind with the occipital, which in turn borders on the right and left with a postparietal larger than itself. Next to the occipital are two rows of very small nuchal scales smilar to those on the neck. Each supraocular region has five or six large plates, which embrace two or three smaller ones externally, which are bordered exteriorly by five superciliary plates. Nostril opening wide, situated in the posterior part of the nasal, which is subrectangular; this plate is in contact anteriorly with the supranasal scute, and above with that of the first prefrontonasal; below with the two first supralabials and behind with the two superposed nasoloreals; loreal either single or double, a larger above a smaller. The loreals are followed by one large hexagonal preocular; next come three suboculars, the latter well developed as to length. There are ten supralabial plates; the first seven are quadrilateral; of these the third, the fourth, and the fifth are the highest; the eighth and ninth are pentagonal, and the tenth ends in an acute angle; four pairs of inferior labials; the cheek scales are smooth, imbricated, and polygonal. The ear aperture is triangular and surrounded by granular scutella. Genial undivided and is followed, on the right and left, by three large, smooth, submaxillary plates; those of the first pair are in contact with each other on the internal side, and all are separated on the opposite side from the inferior labials by a row of scales. .
Lateral fold beginning under the eye and ending at the side of the cloaca; the scales on the side of the neck are granular. The cervical and dorsal seales are subrhomboid and of medium size; they constitute fourteen longitudinal series and fifteen transverse from the nape of the neck to the posterior border of the thighs; those of the vertebral region are obtusely keeled or smooth, while those on the sides are Smooth. Ventral plates of very nearly the same dimensions, subquadrilateral, with a bowed posterior border, forming twelve longitudinal aud forty-two transverse rows from the level of the arm to the anus, which is bordered by four scutella. Tail with fifty-seven whorls of scales, upper caudal scales more strongly keeled than those of the dorsals. Limbs short; the anterior ones covered above with flat scales and underneath with granular ones. The toes are protected above and below by a series of scaly plates; the claws are short and curved.
Measurements.—Total length of a specimen, with the tail, 149 mm.; length of head from the end of the muzzle to the middle of the ear,

<<<Page: 563>>>

15 mm.; length of head to the borders of the temples, 10 mm.; length of body trom chin to anus, 69 mm.; length of tail, 80 mm.; length of arm to the end of the middle finger, 15 mm.; length of leg to the end of the longest toe, 21 mm.
Upper part of body is bronze green; head spotted with black on top; three black longitudinal bands on the back, of which the middle one is the widest and extends to the middle of the tail (these bands may be represented by series of brown spots); flanks and sides of neck with vertical black bars or a black network inclosing greenish-white dots; a streak of the same color on each side of the head ona black ground color; this line begins at the nostril, passes beneath the eye, crosses the cheek, and fades out on the side of the neck in the midst of spots of the same color, or it may be wanting on the cheek; lower surfaces dark green, with numerous small, angular, yellowish-white spots. The specimen sent to M. Bocourt by Professor Peters has the breast light green, with numerous greenish-black spots, some of which are as large as those on the belly and tail.
Concerning this species, M. Bocourt remarks: “ G. antauges closely resembles G. (Mesaspis) moreletii in the shape of the head and the coloration of the upper surfaces. It differs from the two other species here described, in the presence of an anterior dorsal plate, agreeing in this respect with the G. fimbriata.”

Boulenger’s description is as follows:
Tongue short, villose, with a narrow feebly incised, retractile anterior part covered with flat pipille. Dentition strictly pleurodont; teeth numerous, small, with long cylindrical shafts, the laterals with obtusely bior tricuspid crowns; the new teeth originate between the bases of the old ones. Palate toothless. Postorbital and frontosquamosal arches bony; supratemporal fossa not roofed over by bone; premaxillary, frontal, and parietal single; nasals distinct; palatines and pterygoids widely separated medially, both bordering the infraorbital fossa; a supraorbital bone. Limbs well developed. Clavicle slender, not dilated proximally; interclavicle T-shaped; sternum without fontanelle.
The unique genus, of which the preceding description is given, constitutes a connecting link between the Iguanide and the Anguide. Its affinity to the former is shown by the T-shaped clavicle, the absence of symmetrical bony shields on the

<<<Page: 564>>>

head, and of osteodermal plates on the body; to the latter by the structure of the
tongue, the teeth not hollowed out at the base, and the widely separated palatine
bones.
In Xenosaurus the alimentary canal presents nothing exceptional. There is no distinct colon, and hence no cecum. The liver is elongate as in other Diploglossa, and the gall bladder is proximad to the margin, and is just visible from below. The corpora adiposa do not project freely into the body cavity. The kidneys are large. The mesenteries are of the normal type.
The hemipenis of Yenosaurus is quite peculiar. There are no calyeuli or flounces. There is a prominent fold with pectinate edge on each side of the sulcus spermaticus, which incloses a pyriform area, This is divided in the middle by a longitudinal fold, which represents the welt opposite the sulcus of various other genera, and its distal end terminates in a free papilla. From the apex there depend two large divergent club-shaped papille, which have a series of points along the adjacent sides. There is a small papilla at the base between them. The arrangement has a remote resemblance to that seen in the Chameleon perdalis, and is unlike anything found in the other Diploglossa.
The following are the characters of the only known genus:
No abdominal ribs. Head covered with small tubercular scales, which coalesce with the skull. Eyelids well developed. Tympanum covered with scales. Body depressed, covered above with granular scales intermixed with tubercles, inferiorly with cross rows of squarish juxtaposed scales; no bony plates. Digits well developed, with sharp, curved claws. Nofemoralpores. Tailround.. Xenosaurus Peters. But one species of this genus is known, the Yenosaurus grandis Gray,
a rather small Mexican lizard. The genus Hxostinus Cope from the
White River bed of Colorado resembles this one, so far as known, and
may enter the same family.

Superior plate of petrous bone produced anterior to the anterior semicircular canal. Clavicles proximally dilated, usually perforated. Interclavicle cruciform (with exceptions in degenerate forms). Frontal bone not underarching olfactory lobes. Postorbital and supratemporal arches present. Surface of tongue squamous or plicate, not papillose. Hemipenis never calyculate.
In addition to the above definitive characters, the following are general, but with actual or possible exceptions. Surangular and angular bones distinct from each other.
Meckel’s cartilage inclosed. Premaxillary not bounded behind by a foramen on each side of the inferior plate.
As regards the visceral anatomy, it may be said that the corpus

adiposum is present and free, except in certain Scincide, where it is wanting. The urinary bladder is present, except in Teiide, where it is wanting.
A colon is rarely present, and the alimentary canal is not very elongate. The liver has usually but one or two notches behind, but there are modifications to be mentioned under the heads of the respective families. Itis not elongate, except in serpentiform types. The ventral mesentery extends as far as the liver, and sometimes a short distance beyond. The transverse or cystic mesentery is present.
The families differ as follows:

Of these families the Xantusiide and Teiide are confined to the New World and the Lacertide and Gerrhosauride to the Old World. The Scincidae are cosmopolitan, abounding most in the warmer parts of the South.

Tongue short, scarcely extensible, indistinctly nicked anteriorly, with oblique overlapping plice converging toward the median line, and scalelike imbricate papillz on the distal extremity. Dentition strictly pleurodont. Postorbital and supratemporal arches bony, strong, the supratemporal fossa roofed over by the cranial bones; premaxillary single; nasals, frontals, and parietals two; palatines in contact with each other anteriorly and with the maxillary and ectopterygoid, there being no

infraorbital fossa. Limbs well developed. Clavicle dilated, loop-shaped proximally; interclavicle T-shaped. No abdominalribs. Head covered with symmetrical shields, without dermal ossifications. Body granular or tubercular above, plated inferiorly. No movable eyelids.
The hemipenis is bifureate in Xantusia, and is shortened, as in many Geckonidz, appropriately to the fragile tail. There is a welt on each side of the sulcus spermaticus, which follows a short spiral direction. Opposite to the sulcus are two short thick welts, which have the direction of parts of consecutive threads of a screw. All of the welts are deeply cross folded.
The position of this family in the system has been discussed by M. Bocourt! and myself. I associated the genera Yantusia Baird, Lepidophyma Duméril, and Cricosaura Peters, and stated that I was not able to distinguish them from the family Lacertide. M. Bocourt places these genera in the family “ Trachydermi,” which also includes Heloderma Wiegmann. This family is divided by M. Bocourt into two subfamilies, the Glyphodonti for Heloderma, and the Aglyphodonti for the three genera named, together with Xenosaurus Peters. Previously to this® I had examined and compared the osteology of the Heloderma and Xenosaurus. On account of the differences in the form of the mesosternum and in some other points, I regard Yenosaurus as the type of a peculiar family to be placed with the Helodermide in the tribe Diploglossa. Xantusia, Lepidophyma, and Cricosaura are, on the other hand, not Diploglossa, but are Leptoglossa. They are allied to the Lacertide, and especially to the Asiatic Ophiops, which is, like them, without eyelids. The character of the tongue is, like that of the Ecpleopide, uniformly squamous, and has no resemblance to that of the Diploglossa. The characters of the scapular arch are those of the Leptoglossa. The clavicle is loop-shaped proximally and the mesosternum is cruciform in Lepidophyma and Xantusia. Ihave not been able to examine Cricosaura as to these points. In my paper first mentioned I stated that these genera have distinct parietal bones. I think that they should, on this account, be distinguished from the Lacertidw, where they are coossified.

<<<Page: 567>>>

Each of these genera includes but one species, excepting Xantusia, which embraces two. All belong to the Pacific and Sonoran districts, except Lepidophyma, which occurs in the Central American (Mexican).
In addition to the characters which I have previously given, Mr. Boulenger states! that the sternum is without fontanelle. I find the hyoid apparatus has characters somewhat similar to those of the Lacertide. The ceratohyals and second ceratobranchials are both _ present and there is a well developed free epibranchial. Its proximal end overlaps the distal end of the second ceratobranchial. It passes around the extremity of the first ceratobranchial and extends forward. In Lepidophyma it has the peculiarity, which I have not seen in any other lizard, of being inserted on the lateral process of the basioccipital. In Xantusia riversiana it terminates before reaching this point. In Lepidophyma it displays a concave expansion as it passes the extremity of the first ceratobranchial, in which lies the helicoid cartilaginous extremity of the latter. In neither genus are the hypohyals prolonged with the ceratohyals, as in Anguide, nor beyond them as in the Teiide.
The stapedial disk in Lepidophyma is not sunk in a canal, as in the Iguanide and some other Sauria. The columella is slender, and terminates in the interstapedial cartilage. This supports an oblique cartilaginous rod, one end of which (suprastapedial) is attached to the osseous wall above, and the other longer one (epistapedial) is in contact by a flat surface of its extremity with the membranum tympani.
The remarkable characters of the skull in Xantusia are described under the head of that genus. Bocourt” represents a probably similar structure in Lepidophyma.
Xantusia and Lepidophyma agree in their visceral characters. The corpus adiposum is small and projects freely into the abdominal cavity. The alimentary canal is distinguished into stomach, small intestines, and rectum only, the latter elongate. The posterior border of the liver has a small middle lobe; right lobe moderately produced. Lungs equal. Mesenteries normal.
The contents of the stomach of a Xantusia riversiana include vegetable remains, and fragments of hymenopterous and coleopterous insects, Showing a mixed diet.

undivided scale. Three folds on the throat, the anterior connecting the ears inferiorly and encircling the head. Pupil vertical; no eyelids. Digits 5-5,
Teeth pleurodont, tricuspid; about ten upper maxillary, nine palatine. Roof of mouth extended backward as far as angle of mouth and euding in a W-shaped outline, the central angular notch behind. This is due to dermal flaps extending from the palatine bones, which overlap on the middle line. Tongue thick, fleshy, depressed, and oval, entirely attached behind and by a central band, the terminal two-fifths free, and slightly notched, the base entire. On the basal third of the tongue above are two oblique series of wrinkles converging anteriorly ; these soon become finer and closer, the anterior portion being covered with short, compact, depressed, scale-like papillie.
Osteology.—My knowledge of the osteology of this genus is derived from the X. riversiana, specimens of which I owe to my friend, Dr. J.J. Rivers, of Oakland, California.
The premaxillary has an elongate spine above and a nearly transverse posterior border below. Nasals well developed, distinct. Frontal single, grooved below. Parietal single, without pineal foramen, produced posteriorly so as to overhang the occipital bone and foramen magnum, being connected with the former by a median keel, which it sends downward. The supraoccipital is subhorizontal and is not articulated in the usual way with the parietal, having only the median contact above mentioned. It is coossified with the exoccipitals. The prefrontal is small and is not produced far over the orbit. Lachrymal absent. Jugal with the superposterior limb expanded. Postfrontal and postorbital fused into a triangular bone, which bounds the parietal externally, thus, with the supratemporal, roofing over the temporal fossa. Supratemporal in contact throughout with the parietal, except where separated by the narrow splint of a paroccipital. Quadrate with one, a large external conch. Vomers closely juxtaposed throughout, coossified anteriorly, the median portion of the two elements with an excavation. Narial orifices nearly closed, except posteriorly, where the vomerine process of the palatine overarches them. The latter are in contact in front, but soon spread apart. Maxillary processes rather Shorter than vomerine, depressed below them. Pterygoids narrow throughout, not wider than palatines, their posterior part with a groove which looks upward and inward. Basipterygoids overlapping their entire internal face. Eetopterygoids wide, reducing the palatine foramen to a mere slit; with a considerable contact with the palatine, and a recurved portion in contact with the extremity of the maxillary; the internal extremity depressed. No presphenoid; sphenoid separated by Suture from basioccipital, whose lateral processes are compressed and decurved. The postoptic bone seems to be wanting. The petrosal is well produced beyond the semicircular canal, and is equally produced below the trigeminal foramen, where it joins a backward directed process of the basipterygoid. The groove below it is well defined and looks

<<<Page: 569>>>

downward. The epipterygoid rises at the basipterygoid and rests on the anterior border of the petrosal and the posterior border of the wellmarked descending process of the parietal. Fenestra ovalis not sunk in the fundus of a fossa.
The mandible is remarkable in having but three bones. The articular, angular, and surangular are coossified, and the splenial and dentary. The coronoid has little horizontal production on the outside of the ramus, and the angle of the dentary extends considerably posterior to it. The Meckelian groove is entirely closed.
The hyoid apparatus is described under the head of the genus Xantusia.
There is no zygosphen. There are six cervical intercentra besides that of the atlas. The cervical ribs begin on the fourth vertebra. Four of these ribs are of peculiar form, being expanded and truncate at the extremity so as to be somewhat fan-shaped. Neural spines rather low on the cervical and caudal regions, and lower on the dorsal vertebre. Caudal vertebre segmented toward the anterior part, the fissure passing through the middle of the diapophyses. Neural spine single, oblique, posterior; chevron bones normal.
Suprascapula short and wide; scapula without proscapula. Coracoid with one notch; sternum without fontanelle. Interclavicle with moderate posterior limb. Sternal ribs three; xiphoid rods not juxtaposed, supporting two ribs. No abdominal ribs.
Pubes meeting at about a right angle; pectineal angles near the middle, decurved. Pubis with tuber exterior. [lium without angulus criste; acetabulum entire.
The teeth have compressed tridentate crowns; those of the premaxillary bone are not conic, but have also compressed crowns, where traces of denticles are sometimes apparent.
The remarkable features in the osteology of this genus are (1) the peculiar relations between the parietal and supraoccipital bones, which resemble the structure seen in a sea turtle; (2) the wide ectopterygoid; (3) the absence of lachrymal; (4) the presence of only three mandibular elements. The affinities are a mixture of those of the Lacertide and Scincide ; the large postfrontal bones; the descending processes of the parietals, and the form of the pubes, resembling the corresponding parts in the latter family. The expanded cervical ribs resemble those of the — Geckonid genus Phyllodactylus. The relations of the parietal and occipital bones are quite different from those found in the Lacertide and Anguide (Gerrhonotus, Celestus, Ophisaurus), where the temporal fossie are also roofed over. In these forms the contact is normal, that is, by the elevated median portion of the anterior border of the occipital.
Three species of this genus have come under my observation. They may be distinguished by the following characters:
Small; limbs short, barely overlapping where appressed to the sides. Tail short,
equal from vent to angle of mouth; one row of supraocular scales; one parietal on each side. Color, light brown with dark brown speckles...-..-. X, vigilis Baird.

XANTUSIA VIGILIS Baird.
Xantusia vigilis BaAtRD, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1858, p. 255.—BOULENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II 1885, p. 327.
The hind leg extended twice forward reaches to the first gular fold, and is contained about two and three-fourth times in head and body, the head four and one-half times; the hind foot from heel nearly six times. The claws are all very small; the digits covered beneath by a series of transverse and imbricating plates.
The color above generally is a dull brownish yellow varied with small blackish spots on single tubercles. The young specimens exhibit a yellowish vermiculation on a brown ground distinctly seen on the sides of body, neck, and head. There are two yellowish paral-
lel lines from the supraoculars down the back of the neck becoming finally lost, aud between
these on the back of the neck pee Ue . XANTUSIA VIGILIS BAIRD. are two more, making four yel3
low lines on the nape. The Re oseasor alt et under parts are whitish.
In this species the head is short and covered above by a small num‘ber of very large plates. It is bounded behind by a constriction which borders the posterior extremity of the large occipital plates, passes through the ears, past the end of the lower jaw and across the throat, thus completely separating the neck from the head. ‘The head is short, broad, pyramidal, and quadrangular; the sides nearly vertical; the rostrum rather pointed, its upper outline convex. There is a very large hexagonal interparietal plate (the largest on the head), behind which are two other irregularly pentagonal postparietals side by side, applied against the two posterior faces. The oblique lateral borders are in contact with an elongated pentagonal plate, and the anterior with two adjacent subtriangular parietal plates, the long sides nearly equal. These cover the whole supraorbital space, are in contact behind only with the interparietal and parietal plates, excepting a very small one, postero-externally. The plate which represents the frontal is rhomboidal, broader than long, the lateral corners truncated and in contact with the supraoculars. This, with the frontoparietals, completely

<<<Page: 571>>>

fills the interorbital space, bordered externally by six small square supraoculars. Next comes a pair of prefrontals shaped like the frontoparietals, but only half the size; then a small regularly hexagonal frontonasal, the two anterior faces of which are in contact with a pair of internasals, which connect with the rostral, which is entirely terminal and not at all visible from above. The superior plates form a regular succession of plates in pairs and single, four of the former and three of the latter, or 2,1, 2,1, 2, 3, 2, the anterior median being bordered on either side by the postnasal. The rostral plate is low, wide, nearly linear, with eight labials on either side. The nostrils are small, terminal or lateral, and placed over the junction of rostral and labial or in the corners of the rostral, labial, internasal, and nasal (in the antero-inferior corner of the latter). There is a large pentagonal postnasal, higher than broad, articulating above with the frontal and postfrontal. The loreal is large and separated from the orbit by two small plates, the lower subcircular and over the junction of ihe third and fourth labial. The orbit is completely surrounded by a circle of small plates, of which six are superior, six posterior and inferior, and three or four anterior. There is a large central inental, with seven labials on each side. The labials are bordered internally by five plates, the anterior three much broader than the labials, and filing up the end of the lower jaw, except a median plate connecting the second on either side.
The eyes are large, the pupil elliptical and vertical. A membranous circle, with the edges crimped, seems to represent eyelids. This is however, apparently not protractile and is wanting above.
The auricular openings are vertical, elongated, and directed upward aud backward. It has a border anteriorly of six or eight small tubercles, less than those which cover the cheeks anterior to it.
The back and sides are covered with small, close, bead-like tubercles arranged in transverse series. They are rather elongated and alternate in adjacent rows. There are about forty in a series across the back. The chin and throat, to the first fold, are similar but more rounded. The two throat folds are close together, the plates in their interval rounded, but smaller than elsewhere, the space between them covered with four series of square plates increasing successively to the hinder one, which, however, is not as large as those on the breast. The under parts from the hinder fold to the anus are covered with regular square plates in ten longitudinal series, raised to twelve by a lateral more irregular and rather smaller row on each side. These plates do not alternate in successive rows, but form longitudinal series, these twenty-eight transverse series from throat to thighs and three on the pubis of two each increasing progressively in size until those bordering the anus are much larger than on the belly. The tail is encircled by about seventy whorls of seales which lengthen behind; they are composed of square plates, the upper more convex from side to side.

<<<Page: 572>>>

The legs are rather short, covered with tubercles like those on the back except on the upper surface of the humerus and the anterior of the forearm and thigh and under surface of tibia, which are covered with large plates. The femoral pores, nine or ten in number, are not conspicuous. The digits are short; the fourth hind toe not much longer than the third; its free portion only half the head from snout to ear.
In his report on the reptiles of the Death Valley expedition, Dr. Stejneger remarks:
Two additional specimens are now before us, one collected by Dr. Fisher at Ilesperia, on the south side of the Mohave Desert, on January 4, 1891, while Mr. Palmer secured the other on February 24, in Pahrump Valley, Nevada, thus extending the range of the species nearly 200 miles eastward. The type locality, Fort Tejon, is in an open canon—the celebrated Canada de las Uvas of the early exploring expeditions—connecting the west end of the Mohave Desert with the San Joaquin Valley. The fauna and flora of this canon present a mixture of Mohave Desert and interior valley forms.
In all probability this species is more or less nocturnal in habits, which may aceount for the scarcity of specimens collected.
Both specimens are somewhat larger than the largest of the types, and, judging from the condition of the femoral pores, I take them to be adults.
There appears to be some slight variation in the shape of the individual head shields and in the shape of the head, the Death Valley expedition specimens having it somewhat more elongate; but the differences are not greater than between the type specimens themselves.
Mr. J. Van Denburgh! states further that—
X. vigilis is the most abundant lizard in the territory it has chosen for its home. It seems to be peculiarly dependent upon the presence of tree yuceas. A glance at Dr. Merriam’s map (N. Amer. Fauna, No.7,map 5, 1893) shows that these weird plants grow in each of the localities from which the species has been recorded, viz: Fort Tejon in the Canada de las Uvas, and Hesperia, in California, and in the Pahrump Valley in Nevada,
Dr. C. H. Gilbert and the writer collected specimens near Mojave, and found a portion of a cast skin at Victor, California, in November, 1893. In September of the following year the writer found this species common at Mojave and Hesperia, and secured a single specimen near Cabazon on the eastern slope of San Gorgonio Pass, California. The first three of these localities are situated in the great Yucca arborescens belt, which extends along the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert. The last is in a small and apparently isolated grove of smaller tree yuccas, seemingly of another species.
Habits.—These observations were made in the neighborhoot of Mojave, California, November 4, 1893. About a mile from the station there is a considerable forest of Yucca arborescens. The many trees and wind-broken branches which lie decaying on the ground afford a home to numerous colonies of white ants, scorpions, viciouslooking black spiders, and several species of beetles. In a deep crack of one of these branches a small lizard was discovered, which, when caught, proved to be a young Xantusia vigilis. Probably it had not yet learned how to hide from the day, for I have never seen another undisturbed individual.
The key to their home once discovered, the collection of a large series of these lizards was merely a matter of physical exertion. Every fourth or fifth stem that was examined gave up its Vantusia, and, in one instance, as many as were previously known to collections were found under a single tree.
Most of the lizards were found between the bark and the ground, but many had
1 Proc, Cal. Acad. Sci, (2), V, 1895, p. 523.

<<<Page: 573>>>

hidden in the thick clusters of dead leaves, from which it was very difficult to dislodge them. When first exposed to the light, they were dark colored, and seemed dazzled for a moment, during which they made no attempt to escape. They were not at all sluggish, however, and if not caught immediately, made for the nearest cover as fast as their very short legs would permit. This cover was often the collector, and the little lizards either hid under his shoes or climbed his legs, sometimes even reaching his shoulders. They showed no desire to enter the numerous holes in the ground about them, or to escape by burrowing. Put into a glass bottle they became very light colored in a few minutes, but began to turn dark again immediately after sundown. Young specimens were numerous, and remained dark longer than adults. Many fragments of cast skins were found, but never a whole skin in one place. The stomachs of several individuals contained the wings of some small dipterous insect, the elytra of a little brown beetle, and some very small white bodies which resembled spiders’ eggs.
Several specimens were taken alive to the Leland Stanford Junior University and kept for some months in a large glass jar in which some fine sand and pieces of wood and bark had been placed. At first they ventured out from their retreat only at dusk unless disturbed, but after a few days they seemed to become more restless, and, urged perhaps by hunger, showed themselves many times each day. At night, when they were always more active, they often climbed to the top of a piece of yucca stem placed upright in the middle of their cage. No desire to burrow was observed. All declined to show any interest in the small beetles and flies, both dead and living, which were placed in the jar, and finally became greatly emaciated. They were chloroformed in March, 1894.
A second note dated Mojave, California, Sitombes 17-18, 1894, is as follows:
As it was not practicable to learn by actual investigation whether or not_X. rigilis hid, during the day, among the thickgrowing leaves of the living yuccas, the localities examined in 1893, still clearly marked by the displaced rubbish, were again searched with great care. The fact that very few specimens were now secured in this previously worked area, while the species was very common just outside its limits, is evidence that the specimens found on the ground under the dead branches were in their true diurnal home, and not mere stragglers from the living yuceas.
The specimens were all caught alive and put into a large glass bottle, but were
soon killed by the heat, although care was taken to keep them in the shade as much as possible. Count was kept as the lizards were put in the bottle, and showed later that several more were taken out than were putin. This may have been due to a mistake in the record, but was more probably caused by the birth of young after capture. The adults were afterwards carefully examined, and three were found to contain young, showing that the species is ovoviparous. One of the three contained two fetuses; the others have one each. These fetal specimens are about the size of the young found under the dead branches.

XANTUSIA PICTA Cope.
Xantusia picta Copr, American Naturalist, 1895, pp. 859, 939.
As already noted in the analytical table of species of Yantusia, this species is of more slender proportions than the two other members of the genus; its limbs and tail are much longer, so that its habitats are probably different from theirs. There are numerous minor differences in the squamation, and the head is much flatter than in either of the other species, as well as somewhat wider. In its coloration it is remarkably different, being much more elegant than the others. its seutal characters ally it with the YX. vigilis rather than with the XY. riversiana.
Head very much flattened and broad behind; body and proximal half of the tail flat, distal half of the latter cylindric. The tail tapers gradually from the base, and is not swollen as in the other species. It is twice the length of the body. Extended hind limb reaching to shoulder; extended fore limb reaching anterior border of orbit. The

digits are not very elongate; the first finger is shorter than the fifth, _and the second toe extends farther distad than the fifth, which extends a little beyond the first. Claws well protruded from their sheaths. The head scuta are a good deal like those of the XY. vigilis. The internasal is rectangular, and isa little wider than long; the frontonasals are longer than wide and have considerable mutual contact. The frontal is wider than long, as is each of the occipitals. External to the parietals is a series of four or five smaller scuta, of which the first two are in contact with the supraoculars One nasal, two loreals, the posterior larger than the anterior, and two small preoculars. Kye resting directly on superior labials. There are six of the latter on each side, and a seventh scale is separated from the mouth border by smaller Scales. The fifth and sixth bound the orbit. In the X. vigilis there are seven and eight scales on the mouth border; the fifth isimmediately below the eye, from which it is separated by a series of minute scales. A large symphyseal, and only four inferior labials in contact with the lip border: a fifth separated from it by scales. The third and fourth are

<<<Page: 575>>>

separated by the large third infralabial, which reaches the lip border, I do not remember any other lizard in which this occurs. In X. vigilis there are five inferior labials in an uninterrupted series, the fifth separated from the lip border by a scale. Infralabials six on each side, the anterior three larger than the posterior three; the anterior pair in contact on the middle line, the others separate. The auricular meatus is nearly as large as the orbit, and has no processes on its anterior border,
The dorsal and lateral scales are subround, smooth, and in transverse series. They are subequal and measure about 0.33 mm. The abdominal scales are much larger, are subquadrate and in transverse rows. Each row includes fourteen (in the largest sixteen) scales. In X. vigilis there are twelve and fourteen. Femoral pores ten (six and seven in X. vigilis). Ten large scales in the gular collar. Preanals in three series; two narrow series of four scales each in front, and a pair of very large scales behind, each bounded by a much smaller scale at the posterior outer angle. Scales of limbs rather uniform, larger on the external surfaces, largest on the anterior and inferior faces, where they nearly equal those of the belly, but have rounded borders.
Measurements.—Total length (tail complete), 124 mm.; length to vent, 50 mm.; total length to axilla, 23 mm.; total length to collar, 18 mm.; total length to meatus auditorius, 11 mm. Length of fore leg from axilla, 17 mm.; of fore foot, 6.5 mm. Length of hind leg from groin, 25 mm.; of hind foot, 10 mm.
Ground color, light pinkish-gray. This is overlaid by two dorsolateral rows of large purplish-brown spots which are only separated by narrow lines of the ground. The tail is marked by two similar rows of smaller and more widely separated spots. Hind limbs closely, fore limbs sparsely spotted. Head plates purplish-brown, with pale borders. Inferior surfaces uniform yellowish.
I have seen but one specimen of this species. It was sent me by Dr. J. H. Rivers, of the University of California, to whom I am also under obligations for the first specimens of the species next to be described. Dr. Rivers states that the former specimen was taken at Tejon Pass, in southern California.
XANTUSIA RIVERSIANA Cope.
Xantusia riversiana Copr, American Naturalist, 1879, p. 801; Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1883, p. 29.—BouLENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II, 1885, p. 328.— Rivers, American Naturalist, 1889, p. 1100.
The scales of the dorsal and lateral regions are rather coarsely and uniformly granular. The abdominal scales are quadrate, and are in sixteen longitudinal and thirty-two transverse rows. The preanal scales are in three transverse rows, the anterior two of four scales, with the median pair in both much enlarged, and the posterior row of six scales. Scales of the gular region flat and hexagonal, one row on the gular fold a little larger, and equal to the anterior gulars. Scales

<<<Page: 576>>>

of the anterior aspects of the fore leg and femur larger than the others; those of the tibia small, and those of the posterior face of the femur still smaller. Seales of the tail in whorls of equal width. The scales of equal size and all convex in cross section, but not keeled. Noue of the seales of the body or limbs keeled.
The nostril is situated in a small scute at the junction of the sutures which separate the internasal, rostral, first labial, and first loreal scuta. Three loreals, increasing in size posteriorly. A circle of scales surrounds the eye, of which the superior, or superciliary, are the largest. The latter are separated by one row of scales from the parietal, frontoparietal, and frontal on each side. ‘The frontonasal is nearly square. The internasals are considerably in contact. The frontal is hexagonal, and is broader than long. The interparietal is as large as each parietal. Itis longer than wide, and notches the contact of the frontoparietals. The occipitals are large and quadrate. A single large temporal bounds the parietals and occipital, and it is followed by two small scuta, which are in contact with the occipital. A triangular plate interBrees venes between the oceipXANTUSIA RIVERSIANA COPE. ital and parietal. There are eight scales on the upper lip. Of these the fifth is the largest, and is part of an annulus which begins with two sinall scales at the posterior loreal and terminates at the seventh scale, opposite the middle of the pupil posteriorly. The posterior labials are small and are separated by nine rows of still smaller scales from the large temporal. No large auricular scales. The eye is rather large, and its diameter is contained in the length of muzzle in front of it 1.75 times. The vertical diameter of the auricular meatus is a little less.
The first digits of both extremities are very short. The second of

the pes is very little longer than the fifth. All the ungues are acute and are moderately curved. The hind legs are remarkably short, not exceeding the fore legs. Extended forwards the extremity of the fourth digit reaches the elbow of the appressed fore leg. Femoral pores twelve on each side; no anal pores. The tail is not long, and its form is compressed, with a flat inferior surface. The section is a triangle, higher than wide, with the apex narrowly truncate.
The color is light-brown, with dark umber-brown spots on the superior surface. These spots form, in general, one median and two lateral rows, but as their forms are very irregular this order is obscure. The median dorsals are the largest, and they send branches laterally and anteroposteriorly, so that the result is rather confused. Dark-brown bands cross the muzzle on the frontonasal plates and on the frontal, and form a wide U from the frontoparietals passing around the posterior edge of the occipitals. Sides of head with rather large brown spots. Inferior surfaces with minute brown spots, which are least numerous on the middle line. Tail with irregular pale spots.
Measurements.—Total length, 118 mm.; length to posterior edge of occipital plates, 16.2 min.; length to axilla, 29 mm.; length to groin, 55 mm.; length to vent, 60 mm.; width between orbits above, 7 mm.; width at temples, 11.5 mm.; length of forelimb, 17 mm.; length of manus, 8 mm.; length of hind limb, 23 mm.; length of pes, 11 mm.; length of tibia, 7 mm.
The species which has given occasion for the above discussion is several times as large as the type X. vigilis Baird, and has a different coloration. The digits are shorter. The typical specimen was found by Dr. J. G. Cooper, zoologist of the State Geological Survey of California, and was placed in the collections of the University of California, where I saw it. It was kindly lent me for examination by the authorities of the university. The locality from which the specimen was obtained is San Nicolas Island, one of the Santa Barbara group, coast of California. Subsequently, three specimens were obtained from San Clemente Island, California, by the naturalists of the Albatross.
The latter display some differences from the typical specimen, as well as among themselves. They all have the temporal plate transversely divided, two into three plates and one into two, the anterior the largest. In the two smaller specimens the occipitals are divided into two equal parts by an oblique suture. In the largest specimen one occipital is undivided, as in the type, and the other is about half divided anteriorly by an incomplete groove. The character of the two rows of supraorbital scales is present in all. The largest specimen is double the size of the largest of the Y. vigilisknown. Without the tail, which is injured, the length is 85 mm.; length to axilla, 38 mm.; to meatus auditorius, 19 mm.
Three specimens from the Santa Barbara Islands were subsequently sent me by Dr. Rivers. In all of them the temporals are divided, gen

erally into three scuta, of which the anterior is the larger. The total length of one of them (tail perfect) is 167mm. The head plates become, in the adults, somewhat corrugated.

ZABEEP SIS Cope:
Zablepsis Cork, American Naturalist, 1895, p. 758.
Pupil erect. The pairs of scuta on the muzzle, the middle pair being ‘he divided frontonasals. Frontal undivided; superciliaries present. Frontoparietals in contact on the middle line; the occipitals separated by an interoccipital.
The scuta of Xantusiide, like those of many of the Leptogloss families, are a definite quantity, and very characteristic. I have hence proposed to separate this form generically from Xantusia, since it differs in the division of the frontonasal and the presence of an interoccipital. The latter plate is only found on this genus in the Xantuslide.
But one species is known, and it inhabits southern California,
ZABLEPSIS HENSHAVII Stejneger.
Zablepsis henshavit Corr, Amer. Naturalist, August, 1895, p. 758. Xantusia henshawi STEJNEGER, Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., XVI, p. 467.
-Dr. Stejneger’s brief description of this species is as follows:
Like Xantusia vigilis it has but one series of superciliaries (or supraoculars), while AX. viversiana has two. It is longer and slenderer than the latter, and is more depressed than either. The color differs from both in being blackish-brown on the upper surface irregularly marbled with cream-colored lines which on the tail incline toward forming cross bands; under side whitish; scales on back small, uniform, flat tubercles; ventral scales in fourteen longitudinal and thirty-three transverse rows, preanal scales in three transverse rows, the two median posterior scales being the largest; about ten femoral pores ov each side. Total length, 148 mm.; length to posterior edge of occipital plates, 15 mm.; length to vent, 65 mm,
Direct comparison of the type specimens shows that this species is quite nearly allied to the Vantusia picta. It resembles it in the proportions of the tail and in the flattened head and body. There are a good many coincidences in the details of structure, as in the size of the dorSal and ventral scales, and in the number of femoral pores. The color

<<<Page: 579>>>

ation alone would not distinguish the two as species, although strikingly different. The differences are, however, important. Tirst, the generic characters of two internasals, and an interoccipital plate. Second, the hind limb is materially shorter, since when extended it only reaches the elbow of the forelimb. Third, the third infralabial is not so large, and does not reach the labial border. There are five inferior labials reaching that margin instead of four. The third (last) pair of preanal plates is not so disproportionately large. As points of minor importance may be added the presence of two wide scales between the second pair of infralabials instead of one; and the fact that the dark color of the superior surfaces appears on the sides of the throat and abdomen, and on the inferior side of the tail, which it does not in the -\. picta.

Concerning this species Mr. J. Van Denburgh remarks that at Witch Creek, San Diego County, California, it lives among the numerous granite bowlders, and comes out into the narrower crevices between them a few minutes before dark. It is, therefore, practicable to hunt for it only about fifteen or twenty minutes each day. Ifa bit of string or a straw be introduced into the domain of one of these lizards it will often be seized, the reptile apparently mistaking it for an insect.!

Amebopsis gilbertii Copr, Amer. Naturalist, 1895, p. 758. Xantusia gilbertii VAN DENBURGH, Proce. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1895, p. 121, pl. x1.
I only know this interesting species from the description and figure given by Mr. Van Denburgh, which I here transcribe. The eye is very small, without lids, and with vertical pupil. The nostrils are pierced at the junction of the rostral, internasal, first superior labial, and first loreal plates. There are 3 loreals, increasing in size posteriorly. There are 2 internasals. The 2 frontonasals are separated by the interfrontonasal, which is in contact also with the 2 frontal plates. The other head plates are 2 frontoparietals, 2 parietals, 2 large occipitals, and 1 interparietal. The eye is surrounded by a ring of small scales,

of which the superciliaries are largest. This ring is separated from the third loreal by 2 small scales. There are 8 superior and 8 inferior labials. The anterior border of the ear is slightly denticulate. The ventral plates are arranged in 32 transverse and 10 or 12 longitudinal series. The caudal scales are smooth, convex, and in whorls of about equal length. The back and sides are covered with smooth convex granules of about uniform size. There are 8 and 9 femoral pores. The gular regions are covered with smooth, flattened, subhexagonal granules, which are slightly larger than those on the back and sides.
The color above is dark brownish clay dotted with black on single granules. A pale yellowish line, two granules wide, runs posteriorly from each occipital plate, but is soon lost on the back to reappear over the thigh.

The single specimen of XY, gilbertii has been compared with 144 of X, vigilis without any approach to any of its distinctive characters having been found. It is of great interest, for it extends the known range of the genus Yantusia several hundred miles to the southward, introducing it for the first time into Mexican territory, and affording another link between the ‘‘Cape region” and the Sonoran subprovince.

Teiide BOULENGER, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (5), XIV, 1884, p. 120.
The following description, with slight modifications, is from Boulenger:
The tongue is flat, more or less elongate, ending in two long smooth points, the greater part of its surface covered with rhomboidal, imbricate scale-like papille; in Alopoglossa, these scale-like papill are replaced by oblique plicie, as in Xantussiidw and the Lacertoid genus Tachydromus. In a few genera the tongue is particularly long and narrow at the base, which is retractile into a sheath; in the others the tongue is bicrspid posteriorly; the whole organ, when the distal points are close together, being arrow-headed.
The teeth vary considerably, but are constantly to be distinguished from those of the analogous family Lacertide in not being hollow at the base, the new teeth developing in small sockets at the base of the old ones. In some of the higher forms (Tupinambis, Dracaena, Teius), the lateral teeth are inserted almost on the parapet of the jaws, so that, in fact, they might be termed acrodont; this dentition © is, like that of the “‘pleurodont” Amphisbenoids, truly intermediate between the acrodont and pleurodont. In the other forms the teeth are attached more distinctly to the inner side of the jaws and there is a basal shaft. The premaxillary teeth are constantly conical; the laterals may be conical, bicuspid, tricuspid, obtuse, or molarlike (adult Tupinambis), or enormous oval crushers (Dracena); the bicuspid teeth

may be either compressed longitudinally, or perpendicularly to the jaws (Dicrodon, Tetus). Pterygoid teeth are but seldom present, and if so, but feebly developed.
In the most highly developed forms the skull presents the typical Lacertilian or Cionocranian structure; but as we approach the Chalcidine forms the skull becomes more depressed, the vacuity between the ante and postorbital portions and consequently the interorbital septum become much reduced, the arches weaker, and at last we have in Ophiognomon a skull where the pterygoids are largely in contact with the sphenoid, the arches are very weak, the columella is so reduced as to be hardly distinguishable, and the whole skull forms an almost continuous solid mass.
The premaxillary bone is single, the nasals double, the frontal and parietal single; asmall supraorbital bone exists in some Ameivas; the palatines are in contact anteriorly ; the maxillary is excluded from the infraorbital fossa, which is bounded by the palatine, pterygoid, and transverse bone, as in Varanus. The headshields are always free from the cranial ossification, a character which separates sharply this family from the Old-World Lacertidi.
Limbs or their rudiments are present; the degradation begins with Proctoporous, which has very short limbs, but with five well-developed clawed digits; the limbs are still more reduced in size in Scolecosaurus, and the digital formula is incomplete, although claws are still present; in Cophias and Ophiognomon digits are either entirely lost or reduced to bud-like rudiments; and in Propus the pelvic limbs have altogether disappeared. The clavicle is dilated and perforated proximally; however, Cope inentions Tretioscincus and Scolecosaurus as forming exceptions, having a simple clavicle; the interclavicle is cruciform.
I have already noted a peculiarity in the visceral anatomy of this family, in the absence of the urinary bladder. This structure is alleged by such authors as Stannius to be present in all Sauria. I have found no trace of it in the genera Tupinambis, Dracaena, Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, Centropyx, Gymnophthalmus, and Callopistes. In all these genera the kidneys have a peculiar form, being expanded trans. versely for the anterior half of their length, and then tapering posteriorly to a point. In this respect they differ from any family of lizards known to me.
The alimentary canal presents the usual three parts, stomach, small intestine, and rectum, with terminal rectal cloaca. There is no especially distinguished colon except in Callopistes. In Dracena a portion of the canal immediately succeeding the stomach is constricted off from the small intestine for a: moderate distance. In Callopistes there is a short wide colon without cecum. The liver is not elongate, and has only one posterior notch. Recurved lobe of the right lobe inconspicuous or wanting. The ventral mesentery extends beyond the liver to a part of the small intestine.
The mesenteric attachments of the liver are very characteristic in the Teiid. There is but one suspensor, a median gastrohepatic, but this bifurcates above the middle of the organ and each half diverges, and adhering to the caudal margin, extends to the lateral inferior body wall. on each side. In Tupinambis these sheets are united on the median line for a distance posterior to the liver. The lungs are each attached to the stomach by aSeparate sheet. The left hepato-parietal sheet is always present in this family, but the right one is feeble in some genera and is easily ruptured, as, for instance, in Cnremidophorus. 1 have

<<<Page: 583>>>

examined the genera Dracena, Tupinambis, Callopistes, Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, Centropyx, Tejus, Anadia, and Oreosaurus.
I have examined the anatomy of Propus Cope, the most degraded and serpentiform type of the family, in order to ascertain whether it exhibits any affinity to the Annulati, as supposed by Boulenger, and to which it has a strong external resemblance. As the anterior limbs only are present, and these are without digits, this genus is even less lacertiform than the Annulate Bipes, so far as external appearance is concerned.
Propus las very slender postorbital and supratemporal arches, and the paroccipital bone is represented by a relatively rather large nodule between the quadrate, the exoccipital and the supramastoid process of the parietal. The last-named process is rather short and, like the rest of the parietal, is closely applied to the occipital, slightly overlapping the latter. The epipterygoid is present, and is in contact with the strongly decurved angular lateral margin of the parietal and the anterior border of the superior plate of the petrosal. The trigemnial notch is as usual in lizards, and the cranial wall anterior to the petrosal is membranous. The stapes is very large and its columella is a mere tuberosity.
Scapular and pelvic arches present; anterior limbs only, and these minute.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present, but the sternum represented by a narrow longitudinal cartilage, and the interclavicle without lateral processes. Clavicle osseous, distally simple; suprascapula cartilaginous; scapula and coracoid osseous. Coracoid deeply twice emarginate, the emarginations occupied by the coracoid cartilage. Sternum with two costal articulations. Fore limbs consisting of humerus and rudimental ulno-radius.
Pelwic arch.—This consists of a simple slender costiform bone, directed downwards and forwards from the diapophysis of a single vertebra. It is homologous wholly or in part with the ilium.
The lungs are in the position normal to lizards, posterior to (above) the alimentary canal.! The left is very much shorter than the right, and though bound to the latter by connective tissues is not fused with : it except at the proximal extremity, and it has no separate bronchus. The small intestine is only moderately complex, and there is a short but conspicuous cecum at its entrance into the large intestine. The liver begins well posterior to the heart, is slender, and has a very small left lobe, and a long and narrow right lobe. The gall-bladder has the usual position between the two. Kidneys elongate, posterior, symmetrical.
The above characters show that there is not as muth resemblance to the Annulati in the serpentiform Teiidae, as there is in the Annielloidea, which see. 7
Two or three types may be observed in the structure of the hemipenis,
' This is also the case in the allied genus Anisoclonium, where the digits are 4-1,

<<<Page: 584>>>

but I have not had access to sufficient material to enable me to refer all the genera to the one or the other. In the typical members, as the genera Dracena, Tupinambis, Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, and Centropyx, the pattern consists of numerous delicate, imbricate, transverse lamin, which are closely applied to each other. Opposite the sulcus all the genera display a welt, which has free borders. These are entire in Dracena, and pectinate in Ameiva and Cnemidophorus. Between these and the borders of the sulcus is a rounded welt on each side. The laminie are at first sublongitudinal, diverging proximad from sulcus; on the first welt they turn sharply distad; between this and the welt oe make a second chevron, turning proximad. Proximad of the medium welt these lamine meet, forming a curve or chevron turned proximad. In Cnemi dophorus there is one less chevron. In this genus and Ameiva there is a strong fleshy papilla at the apex of each tract between the welt and sulcus.
A modification is seen in Centropyx (pelviceps). Here there is a narrow welt opposite the sulcus. On each side of the sulcus a prominent welt diverges from it proximad and approaches the proximal end of the median welt, so as to inclose a space with it. It is transversely plicate, and the inclosed space on each side the median welt has the delicate transverse lamination characteristic of the Teiide. What is entirely peculiar is the presence at the apex of each of the laminate spaces of a large patch of acute flexible papille.
The plan is the same in the Anadia bogotensis, but the details are quite different. The organ is bifurcate. A strong welt opposite the suleus is divided into five longitudinal folds, which are crimped transversely. The space between this and the sulcus is marked with folds which diverge distad from the welt and become longitudinal, and are transversely crimped. In the longitudinal direction of the plicw this geuus differs from true Teiide, and it is likely that Hepleopus and other allied genera are similar.
In a third type represented by Heteroclonium bicolor a welt bounds the sulcus on each side. The space between these is marked by a few feeble cross folds, and the borders support a single series of closely placed recurved spines. Genera allied to Cophias are likely to preseit this structure.
According to Boulenger—
The Teiidw comprise a large number of species, all of which are inhabitants of the New World, which show great variety of form and scaling. The Teiide with Lacertoid and Varanoid appearance pass, through Crocodilurus and Neusticurus, into the Cercosaurs (to which the latter is nearer on account of its separated nasal plates, although placed hitherto with the true Teioids). We have, then, several diverging series, the two principal being: Toward Heterodactylus through Arthrosaura, and toward Cophias through Proctoporus. On the other hand, Cophias resembles Heterodactylus in the position of the nostril, and the latter genus leads us through Perodactylus to the skink-like genera, such as Iphisa and Gymnophthalmus, which all agree with Heter odactylus in the rudimentary condition (or absence) of the inner finger.
The genera differ as follows: The system adopted is a modification of that of Boulenger, but is as yet in a very tentative stage.

The accompanying table gives the geographic distribution of the genera of the Teiide. From this the wide distribution of the genus Cnemidophorus, and the almost equally wide distribution of the genus Ameiva, may be learned. The poverty of the Nearctic Realm is also appar-
ent, while the richness of the Brazilian and Colombian regions is —
exhibited. The distribution of some of the genera entered in these lists is not sufficiently well known to make their place clear. While some genera are found in both regions, there is some doubt about others which appear in both lists, and which have been found in the mountainous regions of the Andes. It is probable that there is a special zoological district in these elevated regions, but whether it is a branch of the Colombian or Brazilian district, or distinct from both, is not now determinable. Some of the Colombian forms range into Panama and Costa Rica. — :

The nostrils are in the large anterior nasal plates, which meet on top on the snout. The posterior nasal forms sutures with the anterior nasal, first and second labials, loreal, prefrontal, and frontonasal plates. The loreal is in contact with the second, third, and fourth labials, first subocular, preocular, first superciliary, first supraocular, prefrontal, and posterior nasal. There are three supraoculars, the first is in contact with the first and second superciliaries, loreal, prefrontal, frontal, and second supraocular; the second is in contact with the frontal; the third is separated from the frontal and the frontoparietal by a-series of granules. The interparietal is very narrow. There is a series of occipital plates. There are five superior and six inferior labials to below the middle of the eye. The ear opening is not denticulated.

Verticaria Corr, Proce. Amer. Phil. Soc., XI, 1869, p. 158.
Sealy portion of tongue cordate behind and not retractile. Tail rounded. Teeth longitudinally compressed. Head shields large, regular; ventrals large; parietals and frontoparietals distinct; supereiliaries segmental. A collar fold. Femoral pores present, in the center of a rosette of scales.
This genus embraces many species of the Neotropical realm, exclusive of the West Indian region, where it is replaced by Ameiva. Five species enter the Nearctic realm, and all but one of these are restricted to the Sonoran region. This one, C. sexlineatus Linneus, ranges the entire Nearctic, excepting the Hudsonian and Alleghenian districts, and the northern parts of the Central and Californian.
Osteology.—For characters of the skeleton I have three individuals of the C. tessellatus from my own, and one of the C. sexlineatus from the national collection. The alveolar portion of the premaxillary is prominent, and is marked off from that of the maxillary bone by a shallow emargination on each side. The superior spine is long, and the palatal border is deeply emarginate to receive the narrow anterior production of the vomers. The nasals are distinct and rather elongate, although encroached on in front by the enlarged nostrils. The frontal is single and is rather narrow. The parietal is without pineal foramen in the adult. The parietoquadrate arch is well elevated, and is braced below by the small paroccipital. The supraoccipital is in close contact with the parietal by its middle portion, and it is distinct from the exoccipital by suture. The prefrontal does not extend above the orbit; the lachrymal is smaller, but rather large, and forms a suture with the jugal. The postfrontal is wanting, being fused with the postorbital. The latter is produced downward and has a longer suture with the supratemporal than with the narrow jugal. The quadrate has an external conch only. The vomers are elongate and are in contact throughout, but each is swollen on the middle line so that they are divided by a groove along their common suture. The narial fissure is long and narrow, and is contracted anteriorly, and then enlarged foramen.like at the anterior extremity. The vomerine branch of the palatines is longer than the maxillary branch; the pterygoid branch is not very wide, and the palatine foramen is of moderate size. The ectopterygoid is rather wide and has an anterior suture with the palatine bone as well as with the maxillary; it is deflected posteriorly. Pterygoid moderately expanded anteriorly and contracting gradually; the posterior portion but slightly grooved, and attached to the basipterygoid process by its

<<<Page: 592>>>

entire width, and not by the groove only. Presphenoid rudimental; sphenoid distinguished from basioceipital by suture; the latter with descending compressed lateral processes. Petrosal with a short presemicircular process, and a long subforaminal process; the latter presenting an open groove downward. Inferior face of frontal grooved. postoptic not reaching frontal, triradiate, the two superior limbs shorter than the inferior. Epipterygoid arising opposite ectopterygoid and in contact with a descending lateral process of the parietal and not touching petrosal.
The hyoid apparatus is distinguished, like that of other Teiidie, by the great prolongation of the hypohyals anterior to the point of attachment of the ceratohyals. No second ceratobranchials or free epibranehials.
In the mandible the Meckelian groove is closed except at the distal portion. The coronoid is produced far anteriorly and not at all posterioily on the external face, and the dentary does not extend much beyond the tooth line. Surangular distinct; angle horizontal, expanded, and forming an angle inwards. <A distinct masseteric fossa, bounded below by the angular. Splenial elongate, extending far anterior to the splenial foramen.
Teeth with the crowns moderately compressed and unequally bicuspid ; those of premaxillary and adjacent part of maxillary bone and corresponding part of mandible, simple.
Dorsal vertebrae with zygosphen. In both C. tessellatus and O. sexlineatus there are five cervical intercentra besides that of the atlas, and the first rib is on the third or fourth vertebra. Two sacral diapophyses, both robust. “Neural spines distinet, moderate, highest in the caudal Series; ribs extending to sacrum. Diapophyses very short except in caudal region, where they extend for 2 considerable part of the length, originating posterior to the middle of the centrum. On the distal part of the caudal series there is an additional short spine-like diapophysis in front of the normal one, and the centrum is segmeuted between the two. The segmentation disappears anteriorly with the disappearance of this prediapophysis. Chevrons intercentral.
The suprascapula is of moderate dimensions and extends to the summit of the neural spine. Scapula elongate, and with a large proscapula. Coracoid with two deep notches. Interclavicle with a very long median limb, which is wide at the base and which covers an elongate oval median fontanelle. Three sternal ribs, and two attached to the xiphoid rod.
Ilium with a prominent angulus criste. Acetabulum entire; pubis directed anteriorly at an acute angle, with median pectineal angle. Ischia directed vertically downward, with angulus tuberosus, and preand post-ischiadic acuminate cartilages.
It is remarkable that in the large species of the allied genus Tupinambis the proscapular process is wanting.

In this genus as in others, some characters which are constant in one species are inconstant in another. The presence or absence of the sixth infralabial, and of the frenodrbital plates, are of this nature. The number of femoral pores varies within a small range in all of the forms. Anomalies in the division of the head plates are rare, but sometimes occur in these genus. Such are the fusion of the symphyseal and postsymphyseal plates, the presence of an additional labial plate, ete.
The discrimination of the North American species of this genus is the most difficult problem in our herpetology. Nowhere are subspecies more clearly defined than in Cnemidophorus, that is, definable geographical forms, which are not always true to their characters.
The color markings differ in the same individual at different ages, and the age at which the adult coloration is assumed differs in different localities. Some of the species, as for example, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus, never abandon the coloration of the young of other species and subspecies. Thesame condition is characteristic of the C. deppei of Mexico, the C. lemniscatus of Brazil, and other species. The process of color modification is, as I have pointed out,' as follows: The young are longitudinally striped from two to four stripes on each side of the middle line. With increasing age, light spots appear between the stripes in the dark interspaces. In a later stage these spots increase in transverse diameter, breaking up the dark bands into spots. In some of the forms these dark spots extend themselves transversely and unite with each other, forming black cross-stripes of greater or less length. Thus we have before us the process by which a longitudinally striped coloration is transformed into a transversely striped one.
1 Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1885, p. 283.

<<<Page: 595>>>

The large number of specimens of C. tessellatus and C. gularis in the U.S. National Museum collection show that the breaking up of the striped coloration appears first at the posterior part of the dorsal 1egion (that is, the sacral and lumbar). The confluence of the spots appears there first; and finally (C. gularis semifasciatus), where the color markings disappear, leaving a uniform hue, this also appears first at the posterior part of the body. In the C. tessellatus rubidus the dark spots disappear first on the anterior regions.
The species of Cnemidophorus inhabit dry open ground where they can observe their insect prey and watch their enemies. Irom the latter they escape by the extreme rapidity of their movements, which renders it difficult to follow them with the eye, to which they appear as a streak flying over the ground. Tor this reason they are popularly known as ‘“swifts.” They are nevertheless frequently caught and eaten by snakes.
Of the species enumerated in the synopsis above given, eight are not found in the Nearctic realm. Thus C. guttatus and C. deppei are restricted to the Central American district, and C. espeutii to certain islands of the eastern coast of Central America. C. murinus and C. nigricolor belong to the northern parts of South America, and C. ocelliJer, C. lacertoides, and C. longicauda to the southern parts of that continent. C. lewmiscatus inhabits tropical South America east of the Andes,

The largest species of the genus, equaling many of the Ameivas in dimensions. Plates of the collar graduating anteriorly into the posterior gular, the series concave anteriorly in the middle, leaving smaller seales on the margin. Anterior gulars abruptly larger, the median largest. Nostril in nasorostral; superorbitals four, frontoparietals separated. Interparietal (in adult) nearly as broad as long; parietals large. Infralabials five. Preanals in four transverse series, the posterior two containing six. Tibials four, femorals seven, abdominals eight, antebrachials (often an unreliable character) four, brachials sevenrowed. Dorsal scales minute. Above olive-brown, with three brown bands on each side, which are as wide as the intervals between them, and are so broken by spots of the ground-color as to resemble series of confluent brown variations. Posterior extremities coarsely reticulate with the same color. Superior surface of tail and gular region blackish varied; abdominal shields black tipped. Under surface of tail and hinder extremities yellow. Upper surface crossbarred, so as to appear annulate in some specimens.
Differs from the C. tessellatus, its nearest ally, in its smaller and more numerous preanal plates, its smaller dorsal scales, and broader light bands, as well as in its superior size.

This species varies in the number of its anal plates, some specimens having fewer than others. The brachial plates also vary in number from six to eight rows. Two young specimens (Cat. No. 12658), in which the umbilical fissure is still open, are about as large as the adult C. sexlineatus. ‘They have a median dorsal light stripe, and two on each side ona blackish ground. Each of the two dark bands thus produced is marked by two rows of pale spots. In this they differ from the spotted striped forms of the C. tessellatus and C. guttatus, which have but one series of such spots. The femur and tibia are crossbarred, and the former is not marked with a longitudinal stripe behind.

Ameiva tessellata Say, Long’s Exped. Rocky Mts., II, 1823, p. 50. Scales of the back and sides generally coarse, .5 mm. in diameter. Scales of the collar not larger than those of the throat, the edge of the

<<<Page: 597>>>

collar with smaller often granular scales. Four supraorbital scales, the posterior smaller than the others. These are separated from both the superciliaries and the frontal and frontoparietal by granular scales whose extension anteriorly differs in different individuals. Fronto-
parietals as large as the parietals, truncate in front. Interparietal
longer than broad, longer than each parietal. The latter undivided. A transverse series of small plates bound the parietals and interparietals posteriorly. Frenal plate longer than postnasal. One row of scuta in front of orbit and below orbit, separating the latter from the superior labials. Superior labials five to below middle of orbit, the fifth acuminate posteriorly. Infralabials five.
Brachial scales in four to eight longitudinal rows (rarely five) counted at the middle, continuous with antebrachials, which are in three rows (rarely two). Post-antebrachials small, uniform. Femoral plates in seven to nine rows (counted at middle and to the line of pores) and
tibial plates in three longitudinal rows. Femoral pores varying from
nineteen to twenty-one in number.
Color varying from olivaceous black to olivaceous brown, which is marked by light yellow or orange longitudinal stripes or spots on the dark ground, or reversed by black spots on a light ground. The head is unspotted and unstriped, except occasional maculations of the gular region. Belly from yellowish to black or spotted. Limbs crossbarred or spotted, and not distinctly striped posteriorly.
The size varies from a length of head and body of 86 mm. to 102 mm. In the former the total length is 260 mm.; in the latter, 350 mm. For more detailed measurements see under the respective subspecies.
This species ranges over the Sonoran and Lower Californian regions and the Pacific, nearly to the northern boundary of California. Its distribution is somewhat coincident with that of the Hutenia elegans (omitting the Rocky Mountains proper), and its eastern border is oyerlapped by the range of the eastern C. sexlineatus. The range of variations of color seen in the C. tessellatus is about the same as that seen in the C. gularis, although, with a few exceptions, the subspecies of the two may be distinguished from each other by color characteristies without examining the scale characters. The parallelism is, however, very close, and shows the same line of modifications. I refer more especially to these under the head of C. gularis.
The subspecies of the C. tessellatus are five, as follows:

In the type specimen of this subspecies the interparietal plate is nar-
rower than the parietals, and is twice as long as wide. The frenal is

<<<Page: 599>>>

longer than the postuasal, and there is no frenoorbital. The first pair of infralabials are in contact on the median line throughout their length. Besides these there ave four infralabials on each side, which are separated from the inferior labials by four plates on each side, which are preceded by a few granules. There are four rows of brachial and three rows of antebrachial scuta (only two rows at the middle of the forearm). The femorals are in seven rows, the second from the front the largest. The tibials are in three rows, the front the largest. There are three large anal plates, two posterior and followed by a granular space anterior to the vent. The edge of the collar is granular, and the granules form a triangular area with the apex forward. On each side of this the scales are about as large as those on the middle of the throat between the jaws. The extremity of the fourth toe of the extended hind limb reaches to halfway between the humerus and the ear. Femoral pores 19 on each side.
Measurements.—Total length, 260 mm.; length of head and body, 86 mm.; length of head to angle of jaws, 22 mm.; to edge of collar, 26 mm.; to axilla, 31 mm.; length of forearm from axilla, 27 mm.; length of fore foot, 11 mm.; length of hind leg, 58 mm.; length of hind foot, 30 mm.; width of head behind orbit, 10 mm.
The color has already been mainly described. The thigh and tibia are longitudinally marbled with dark olive on a pale olive ground. Head, fore limbs, and tail unspotted.
The specimen described is the largest obtained, and it is probably adult. Its colors are rather obsolete, while those of three younger specimens are as strongly contrasted as in the young of any other form. Among all the striped forms of the C. tessellatus, this one is distinguished by the presence of seven stripes and no spots. It is, so far_ as yet known, confined to the valley of the Rio Grande River.

A specimen in the museum of the school of biology of the University of Pennsylvania, of about the size of the type above described, agrees in all important respects with it, with the following exceptions: The second and third infralabial plates are in contact with the labials and not separated by plates, although some minute granules are present, There are six rows of brachial plates at the middle of the humerus and three of antebrachials. The light and dark stripes present a strong contrast of color, the former being rosy and the latter pure black.
-The third black stripe on each side is broken into approximated

blocks. The lateral abdominal plates are black at the base, leaving a light stripe below the inferior black one, not well defined below. This gives the appearance of four light stripes on each side instead of three. Four black spots between orbit and ear, and a few on posterior labials and front of orbit. Legs striped and reticulate with black on a pale ground. Iadd that there are 19 femoral pores, and that the extended hind leg reaches the front border of the auricular meatus.
This form approximates this subspecies to the C. ¢. tessellatus. The habitat of the specimen is unknown.

The seale characters of this subspecies are much like those of the C. t. perplerus. The interparietal plate is generally lai ger, exceeding the parietals, and being nearly as wide in front as it is long. The first pair of infralabials is separated by seales posteriorly. The larger scales ot the mesoptychium extend all the way across it, and they are preceded by a considerable tract of small seales, which are in turn preceded by the large gulars rather abruptly. The brachial scales are in four rows and the antebrachials in three. The femorals are in seven (rarely six or eight) and the tibials in three. Femoral pores from 19 to 21. The hind limb extended, reaches the tympanic meatus with the end of the longest toe. The anal plates are four to six in number— two posterior and two arranged anteroposteriorly in front of them.
Measurements.—Total length, 335 mm.; length of head and body to vent, 102 mm.; length of head to angle of mandible, 26 mm.; length to collar, 35 mm.; length to axilla, 42 mm.; length of foreleg, 34 mm.; length of fore foot, 16 mm.; length of hind leg, 73 mm.; length of hind foot, 37 mm. 7
The adult differs from the young in color, and its colors may be best understood by reference to the latter. In this stage the ground color of the back and sides is black or blackish-olive, and it is traversed by two light-yellowish stripes on each side. One of these starts at the occipital plate and the other at the superciliary angle. The lateral
' Description from a specimen from the Canyon of the Arkansas, Colorado

stripe, which extends from above the auricular meatus in the C. t. perplexus, is here wanting. There is sometimes a trace of a median dorsal — stripe, but generally not. Faint longitudinal lines are sometimes pres. — ent between the stripes mentioned. On the sides below the external stripe are three series of more or less longitudinal spots, which outline three stripes; but they are not connected, excepting sometimes in the transverse direction. This stage represents the C. gracilis Baird and Girard.
In maturer specimens rounded spots appear between the longitudinal stripes, and the lateral spots become connected transversely, so as to |

leave the dark ground color in the form of irregular transverse bars (Cat. Nos. 3047, 4970, 15619). In some specimens the median dorsal Stripe is distinct, and is even divided into two (Cat. No. 11978). Such specimens have six stripes, very close together, and only the external pair on each side are homologous of those of the C. sexlineatus and C. gularis. In the majority of adult specimens the light spots expand transversely and produce an emargination on one side or the other of

<<<Page: 602>>>

the black ground, or cut it into sections or spots by expanding in both directions. In the former case the dark stripes become irregular or undulate in outline. This is their usual condition on the anterior part of the body. On the posterior part of the body the dark ground is usually broken into spots. In the type specimen of the C. tigris Baird and Girard, the breaking up of the black intervals has not been completed, although the specimen is of full size. In typical specimens this part

of the body is marked by three longitudinal rows of transverse black spots. The upper surface of the tail is generally marked with brow spots, sometimes rather large, but in other specimens confined to the keels of the scales. In some they are wanting.
In the last modification the traces of stripes have almost or quite disappeared. The upper pair are first to be interrupted by transverse and oblique extensions of the irregularly shaped black spots, and the inferior stripes are finally interrupted and lost in the same manner.

<<<Page: 603>>>

Thus, in Cat. Nos. 8633 and 3048a, the spots are transversely confluent in every direction, leaving only irregular areas of the white color, now become the ground. These approach nearest to the C. t. variolosus Cope
and represent the C. marmoratus of Baird and Girard. In the type of
that supposed species a trace of the inferior stripe remains on each side. The end of the fourth toe of the extended posterior foot reaches
Fig. 108. CNEMIDOPHORUS TESSELLATUS TESSELLATUS SAY, y. ——1 5 Cat. No, 3048, U.S.N.M.
the meatus auditorius, and there are twenty femoral pores on each side. The length of the head and body is 85 mm.; in Cat. No. 8633 it is 100 mm.
The habits of Cnemidophorus tessellatus tigris are referred to by Dr. Merriam in his report on the Death Valley expedition, as follows:
The whip-tail lizard is nearly as common as the gridiron tail in much of the area traversed, but is not so strictly confined to the Lower Sonoran Zone, ranging up 4

<<<Page: 604>>>

short distance into the Upper Sonoran, and consequently reaching some valleys in which the former species is absent. In this respect it resembles the leopard lizard (Crotaphytus wizlizenii ), with which it is usually found. It lives on the open desert and runs with great rapidity when alarmed.
In California it is abundant in the Mohave Desert, where it ranges westward through Antelope Valley to the Canada de las Uvas (changing to subspecies undulatus), and southward in the wash leading from near Gorman station toward Peru Creek, in the Sierra Liebré. In the open canon leading up to Tehachapi Valley from the Mohave Desert it ranges all the way to the summit of the pass (at Cameron) and probably throughout Tehachapi Valley also, but was not seen there because of a severe cold wind, which lasted all day at the time we passed through. It ranges up from the Mohave Desert over Walker Pass and down on the west slope to the valley of Kern River, where it changes to subspecies undulatus. It is common in Owens Valley, and ranges thence up on the warm, west slope of the Inyo and White Mountains to 2,150 meters (7,000 feet) or higher, opposite Big Pine; and is tolerably common also in Deep Spring Valley. It is common in Panamint, Death, and Mesquite Valleys, ranging from the latter through Grapevine Cafion to Sarcobatus Flat. In Nevada it is common in the Amargosa, Pahrump, and Vegas Valleys, at the Bend of the Colorado, in the valleys of the Virgin and Muddy, and reaches Oasis, Pahranagat, Desert, and Meadow Creek Valleys, and from the latter ranges up among the junipers on the west slope of the Juniper Mountains, to an altitude of 1,980 meters (6,500 feet). In Utah it is common in the Lower Santa Clara Valley, and thence ranges northward to the Upper Santa Clara Crossing, but disappears before reaching Mountain Meadows.
The food of Cnemidophorus tigris consists of grasshoppers and other insects; no leaves or flowers were found in the numerous stomachs examined.
Hallowell in describing this subspecies as C. undulatus recognized the difference between it and the C. ¢. perplexus, remarking that the present form has but two light stripes on each side.
This form ranges the Sonoran region to Utah inclusive, and extends to the northern part of California.

Fig. 109. CNEMIDOPHORUS TESSELLATUS MELANOSTETHUS COPE. ie
Arizona.
Cat. No. 3067, U.S.N.M.
Introparietal plate longer but narrower than the parietals. Posterior supraorbital, not rudimental. First pair of infralabials divaricate behind. Mesoptychial scales homogeneous, smaller, but not granular at the border. Anal plates four, two marginal, the others anteroposterior. Dorsal scales coarse, in transverse rows, the posterior edges

<<<Page: 607>>>

elevated. Brachial scales in five, antebrachials in three rows. Femorals in seven, tibials in three rows. Hind leg extended reaching auditory meatus in front. Femoral pores 20-22.
Measurements.—Total length, 315 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 25 mm.; length to edge of collar, 29 mm.; length to axilla, 35 mm.; length to vent, 86 mm.; length of fore limb, 32 mm.; length of fore foot, 14mm.; length of hind leg, 63 mm.; length of hind foot, 34 mm.
The general appearance of the coloration of this species is that of a — multitude of rather small grayish-yellow spots closely placed on a ground of grayish olive. These may be counted as forming from fourteen to sixteen rows between the abdominal plates of one side and those of the other along the back. There are several black crescentic spots from the axilla posteriorly. The hind limbs and the posterior side of the fore limb are spotted like the back. Thorax and collar, and ~ more or less of the gular region, black. Belly scales with black bases. Tail unicolor above and below, the distal three-quarters of the inferior surface black. A black spot in front of the meatus auditorius, and another below the posterior border of the orbit. A few shades on side of head; top of head uniform olive. In one of the specimens the spots on the middle dorsal region are obsolete, the result being a grayish olive hue.
The coloration of this subspecies is something like that of the C. variolosus, but that is another species. The interparietal plate is narrower than in the (. t. tessellatus, and the black breast and gular region are not seen in it.
A number of young specimens accompany the two adults described. They have two narrow stripes on each side of the middle line, and the spaces between them contain each a row of pale spots. The thorax is not black. These resemble the young of C. t. tessellatus (C. gracilis) but the latter has brighter colors, and when the spaces between the stripes contain marks they are delicate longitudinal lines (Cat. No. 3034, type of C. gracilis).
This form is only known from the Colorado River of Arizona.

flat scales. Infralabials 5, with two large scales posteriorly above the last two. Gular scales medially rather large, twice or thrice as large as the laterals, and equaling those of the mesoptychium. The latter are of moderate size, and are in several transverse series, the posterior smaller at the sides, but not granular. Keels of caudal scales in continuous lines; femoral pores 20-21.
Old specimens black above and below, except the hind legs, palms, and median line of tail below. The superior face of the hind leg is dark olive, closely variegated with light olive. The posterior face of the femur is yellowish, with three black longitudinal stripes; the inferior, which runs along the posterior edge of the femoral pores, is narrow, and sometimes wanting; and the superior pale stripe is sometimes imperfect. In younger specimens of adult size seven narrow, regular stripes a little paler than the ground color may be seen, three on each side of a median vertebral one. The interspaces are obscurely pale, spotted. The inferior stripe extends from the groin to the axilla. In such specimens the coloration of other regions is like that of the adult. Accompanying these is a smaller and probably younger specimen, which nevertheless contains two eggs which have very much the color of the C. sexlineatus. There are seven olive stripes on a black ground, not so bright as on the species named. The under surfaces are white, except the mesoptychium and sides of throat, which are dusky. The limbs are black above, the cubitus with two longitudinal stripes behind, and the thigh with two yellow stripes and a yellow space below posteriorly. Superior face of thigh with two more or less interrupted longitudinal stripes; lower leg with three. No spots in the spaces between dorsal stripes.

This form resembles most the C. t. melanostethus, but the coloration is different in several respects. The uniform black color of the adults is unknown in the latter, and the striping of the legs, especially of the hind legs in the adult, is equally a peculiarity of the present form. The possession of 6 stripes instead of 4, or 3 on each side of the median line, alters this form to the C. t. perplexus rather than to the C. t. melanostethus.
Of the 6 specimens 2 present the adult coloration, 3 of equal size with the adults the obscurely striped, and 1, the smallest, the distinetly striped.

A form very much like this subspecies has been named C. martyris — by Stejneger.1 The two known specimens differ from the C. t. melano— stethus in their smaller size and in the extension of the black over the — entire inferior surface. It is doubtful whether it can be regarded asa — subspecies. It is from the island of San Martir, Gulf of California.

This elegant form is represented in the national collection by seven — individuals, of which three are adult. To the usual characters of the species it adds some others. Thus the scales are rather finer, being a less than 0.5 mm. in diameter. The femoral scales are more numerous. — Femoral pores twenty-two. Small scales of collar border not granular.
There are three parietals, and the longest toe reaches the auricular E meatus. There are the usual three anals, with one in front of the —

median, which is, with the latter, bounded by a few scales on the sides, Median gular scales rather coarse, and abruptly contrasted with the posterior gulars in a transverse line. Loreal longer than high. Small scales above anterior canthus of eye numerous and rather prominent. The keels of the caudal scales are prominent, and, except at the base of the tail, in continuous lines.
The color of the upper surfaces in the adult is adove brown. This is marked on the back by three series of transverse black spots, which are well separated from each other. In one specimen the spots are very narrow; in another they are nearly obsolete on the anterior part of the back. On the sides similar black spots are more or less confluent into vertical black stripes. The head and fore legs are uniform brown above; the hind limbs have on a similar ground narrow blackish crossbars, sometimes indistinct. Tail pale brown above, with olive and brown spots. Inferior surfaces straw-colored tinged with green, and varied with black and red. The abdominal scuta are black bordered, and the throat is black spotted, sometimes strongly, sometimes faintly. The palms and sometimes the entire inferior surface of the anus is a bright vermilion. Posterior and inferior sides of femora, inferior aspect of tibia, and inferior side and distal half of tail bright vermilion.
The young specimens have traces of six longitudinal stripes of an olivaceous or light-brown color, and the spaces between them are crossbarred with black and olive, as in the C. gularis mariarum, which this form closely resembles at this stage. The black spots become more distinct with age, and the interspaces blend completely with the Stripes, so that the latter are ultimately completely lost in a common ground color. The femora are reticulated with black on an orange ground above. The black and red of the inferior surfaces are not so pronounced as in the adult.

Represented in the United States National Museum by four specimens of medium size. The muzzle is rather acute, and moderately elongate. Theanterior gulars are rather larger than the posterior, and are not abruptly contrasted with the posterior, as is the case in the C. t. rubidus, but they graduate into them. The extended hind leg reaches to the orbit. In two larger specimens there are six plates of

the infralabial row, and in two smaller but five. Four large anals, two on the middle line in front of the marginal pair. These four are surrounded by a series of smaller plates as far as the vent. Scales of the tail with the keels slightly oblique throughout. The peculiarity of the subspecies is seen in the large number of rows of brachial scales (7-8 rows), aud femoral scales (8-9 rows). The former are not quite constant, however, one of the smaller specimens having but six rows. Femoral pores 20-22. The scales are smaller than is usual in C. tessellatus, measuring 0.33 mm. and 0.25 mm. in diameter.
The color is generally of the C. tessellatus tessellatus type, but the

<<<Page: 612>>>

black ground color is more persistent. The light stripes are most broken up posteriorly, and the communicating pale cross spots are widest and most numerous. On the sides the pale spots are of irregular shapes, being both longitudinal and transverse on a black ground. Belly black and light olive in varying proportions. Gular region and collar with transverse black spots or bands. Fore limbs black with light olive spots; hind limbs brown with blackish reticulation. Tail brown above, black-spotted below.
I took a specimen which differs in no respect from this subspecies on the road between Reno and Pyramid Lake in western Nevada. The only difference is in the coloration, since the black between the stripes is completely cut up into short transverse bars not wider than the lightbrown interspaces.

CNEMIDOPHORUS TESSELLATUS VARIOLOSUS Cope.
Cnemidophorus tessellatus variolosus Copr, Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1892, p. 39, pl. viut, fig. 6.
This species exhibits the general scale characters of the C. tessellatus, but possesses some peculiarities. Theinterparietal plateis twiceas large as either parietal. Infralabials five. The scales of the brachium and of the femur are smaller and more numerous than in the C. tessellatus. There are six rows of the former, four being the usual number in the latter species; and eight of the latter, six or seven being the usual number. Brachial rows three; tibials three. Anal scuta with the lateral scales rather larger than usual, giving four large and six small ones in all. Femoral pores more numerous, twenty-five on each side. This species is especially characterized by the length of the hind leg, which reaches, when extended, to the postnasal plate, instead of to the meatus auditorius only. The scales of the meso;tychium extend all the way across, and are not interrupted at the middle by the smaller ones as in the C. t. perplecus. The marginal seales are smaller. Posterior gular seales are smaller. bounded in front by the larger scales of the anterior gular region.

ground of the superior surfaces is narked with numerous rather small yellowish oval spots. Those of the sides are irregularly disposed, but those of the superior surfaces are arranged in six more or less irregular series. Of these the two external on each side correspond with the two external stripes of the young of the C. tessellaius. On the nape the series lose their regularity, and on the nape region they are more frequently transverse. The hind legs are olivaceous, marked with numerous irregular oval yellow spots. No stripe on the posterior face of the femur. Head without spots or stripes. Gular region dark olive; thorax blackish; belly yellowish, the scales with black bases. Tail olive with scales above yellowish at the base, brownish beyond; below brown except the basal fourth, which is yellowish with black spots on most of the scales. Posterior limbs with oval yellowish spots on an olivaceous ground. Femur not striped behind.
This species resembles the C. maximus in the increased number of its femoral pores and femoral and brachial scales, but is distinguished by its much longer hind leg, spotted coloration and much smaller size.

stripes of the same tint on each side. The external three of these are homologous with those of the C. tessellatus perplexus and the C. sealineatus, and the additional five are median and equidistant from the other stripes and from each other. There are no spots on any part of the body, head, tail, or limbs.
This species differs from the young specimens of the C. tessellatus of equal size, in the small number of its femoral pores, and in the absence of spots on the hind limbs and sides, as well as in the additional pair
of median longitudinal stripes. The single known specimen is appar—
ently adult, and is about equal in size to a half-grown C. tesselatus, and smaller than the C. variolosus.

Color above, light olivaceous brown, traversed by seven longitudinal broad, black stripes, three on each side and one on the middle line. On the lumbar region the median band disappears, and the pale intervals are wider than the black ones; anteriorly the pale ground assumes its normal relation of stripes on a black ground. The inferior begins at

<<<Page: 618>>>

the orbit and passes over the tympanum; the next begins above the anterior border of the orbit and marks the external borders of the supraorbital plates. The next issues from a parietal plate. Anteriorly the black interspaces have a few small spots; posteriorly they become undulate through lateral emarginations, and more posteriorly the first and second stripes are broken up into quadrate spots, the third remaining unbroken. The hind legs are very indistinetly marbled on an olivegray ground. The fore legs are coarsely reticulated with black on an olive ground. The lateral dark stripes extend to the orbit, and there is a blackish shade on the side of the muzzle, just below the eanthus rostralis. Lower surfaces everywhere yellowish unspotted, except a few black specks on the inferior labials and sides of the gular region. Tail olive above, yellowish below.
This species belongs to the C. serlineatus series, as indicated by the seales of its collar, but it has the coarse scales of the C. tessellatus. Its six infralabial scales are found only in the former series. Its coloration resembles in some degree the stage of the C. tessellatus tessellatus, called by Baird and Girard C. tigris, but it has seven stripes instead of four, and the lateral stripes are broken up and not the median, as is the case in the latter. It also differs from the latter in the marking of the fore leg and nearly uniform coloration of the hind leg, the reverse being the case in the C. tessellatus. The striping of the head is also not seen in thelatter. The head is also narrower in proportion to its length.
This, perhaps the handsomest species of the genus, is represented in the collection by an adult female only.

The longest toe of the extended hind leg reaches to the anterior border of the meatus auditorius. The head is rather short, compressed at the sides, and rounded at the snout in profile. The front plate is large and pentagonal, broad before and narrower behind. On each side there are two large, irregular

<<<Page: 620>>>

rhomboidal superior orbital plates, which supply the place of bony orbits, in front of which is a smaller plate, reaching to the fronto-nasal, and a still smaller plate behind them, On the outer margin of these are two series of small scales, beyond which is a row of seven narrow, elongated plates that form the superior margin of the orbit; the frontonasal plates are regularly pentagonal, broadest externally; the interfrontonasal broad transversely, rounded before and acute-angled behind; the nasals are quadrilateral, rather elongated, meeting in the mesial line above; the opening for the nostril is in its most inferior part, near the postnasal plate, which is triangular, with its basis below and apex above and prolonged. The frontoparietal, interparietal, and parietal plates are nearly all of the same size; the two fronto parietals are truncate in front. The interparietal is longer than wide and parallelogramic in form; with the parietals, it is bounded posteriorly by small plates, of which there are several series behind. There are three inferior orbital plates, placed nearly in a row; the central is quadrilateral, elongated, and narrow; the two others are very small. There is a single loreal plate, pentagonal and large, ascending to the plane of the forehead. The upper jaw is covered at its inferior margin with a row of five small, square, labial plates; the anterior only is trigonal and smallest. There are two series of plates to the lower jaw, the inferior largest, and consisting of five plates, of which those of the anterior pair are in contact with each other. The eyes are rather small, with a dusky pupil and a golden iris: the inner margins of the eyelids are bordered with a very narrow band of bright yellow; the membrane of the tympanum is apparent and of a palish white color; the entrance to it is round and of large size. The body is elongated and covered on the back and sides with minute scales, which measure .33 mm. in diameter in the adult. The scales of the abdomen are large and arranged in eight rows, of which those nearest the middle are largest. The tail is very long, perfectly cylindrical, and covered with verticillated scales, carinated above and smooth below. The vent is transverse and has in front three large scales, placed in a triangle, two posterior to the other and with smaller scales behind.
The anterior extremities are well developed, rounded, covered above at the shoulder with five to six rows of large seales, and with two rows still larger and a smaller row on the front of the forearm; their inferior surface is granulated. The fingers are scaled to the root of the nails, which are short, small, delicate, and curved. The posterior extremities are twice the size of the anterior; the thigh above is covered with granulations, and below with six or seven rows of large scales; the leg is covered like the thigh, but there are three rows of still larger scales below; the tarsus is granulated on its inferior, and has two rows of scales onits superior surface. The fourth toeis very long, and the first and fifth are subequal; all are armed with short, small, curved claws. There is a range of from 15 to 17 femoral pores under the thigh.

<<<Page: 621>>>

The head is dusky brown; the upper jaw bluish white; the lower nearly of a silver-white color. Along the back extends, from the oceiput to the tail, a purple or brownish band, on each side of which are three yellow or golden longitudinal lines; of these, the superior is the palest and shortest; it begins at the parietal plate and terminates at the tail; the other lines are much longer and brighter, the upper one beginning above the orbit and extending to the middle of the tail; the lower line begins below the eye and runs above the tympanum, along the flanks to the anterior part of the thigh; a shorter and more indistinct line extends from the angle of the mouth, below the tympanum, to the shoulder; the spaces between these longitudinal bands are jetblack. The throat is silver-white, and the abdomen of a shining bluishwhite color. The upper surface of the tail is nearly similar in color to the back, but appears much rougher from the verticillated scales; its inferior surface is whitish. There are two longitudinal lines on each side of the tail; the superior one is continuous with the central yellow longitudinal line of the back, and terminates about the middle of the tail; the inferior line is paler, it begins back of the thigh, runs nearly to the extremity of the tail, and seems to divide the upper or darker portion from the inferior or whiter part.
The anterior as well as the posterior extremities are brownish above and bluish-white below, and along the posterior part of the thigh runs a whitish line continuous with the inferior longitudinal line of the tail, bordered by darker above and below.
Measurements.—A specimen from Piney Point, Maryland (Cat. No. 9256). Total length, 235 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 18 mm.; length to collar, 21 mm.; length to axilla,27 mm.; length to vent, 70 mm.; length of forelimb, 24 mm.; length of forefoot, 9 mm.; length of hind leg, 50 mm.; length of hind foot, 28 mm; width of head at front of tympana, 10 mm.
This is one of the smallest species, and it retains the young type of coloration everywhere. It is also distinguished by its short and high muzzle and the absence of postantebrachial scales. It covers the Austroriparian region of the Nearctic realm and the Eastern as far as the range of the Carolinian district, extending to Maryland and Delaware, but not New Jersey. In the Central region it reaches north to the Sand Hills of the Loup Fork River of Nebraska. The only difficulty in defining it is found in specimens from the region which is also inhabited by the C. gularis. In Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona the species merge into each other. If we refer specimens with fewer than eighteen femoral pores and no spots between the stripes or on the sides to the C. sexlineatus, we find that in certain specimens from the region in question the postantebrachial scales are larger than in eastern specimens, though not so large as in the true OC. gularis. Such are Cat. Nos. 4860, 8459, 11839, and 14787. In another series the postantebrachial scales are equally intermediate in size and there are no spots,

but the femoral pores are in enlarged numbers. Such are Cat. Nos. 4788, 11885, 14249, and 15607. From these we pass easily to the true C. s. gularis, with large postantebrachials and spotted spaces.

Two specimens from Florida (one of them from Key West, Cat. No. 15336) display the anomaly of a fusion of the three large anal plates into one. All other Florida specimens are normal.

<<<Page: 623>>>

It is seen by the above table that the most northwestern locality for this form is the Sand Hills of the Loup Fork River of Nebraska (Cat. No. 3144). Next to it in the same region is Cat. No. 5090 from the Republican River, in northern Kansas.

ceeding from the parietal and superciliary scales. At the scapular region the black spaces are broken into square spots, forming three longitudinal series, one median. The other black spaces form transverse bars on the sides, and they are sometimes united above, forming inverted V’s. They tend to fuse with the dorsal series posteriorly, and in one of the types this is completed, thus forming irregular black cross bars. The superior surfaces of both limbs are black, with large yellow spots. Superior dark band extending as shades on the supraorbital plates. A pale light stripe from orbit over meatus auditorius. Gular region unspotted. Black spots covering, or on the base only of, some of the lateral abdominal scuta. ‘Tail with two or three rows of dark spots on an olive ground above; below unspotted. Posterior face of femur with yellow spots separated by vertical dark lines.
But two specimens of this form are contained in the U.S. National Museum, the original types of Baird and Girard. In one of these there are six infralabial scuta on both sides, and in the other there are but five on one side. On the other side there are spaces for six, but two are fused into one, so that I believe that six is the normal number for this subspecies as it is for the others. Two other specimens were obtained by Mr. W. L. Black, of the geological survey of Texas, at Tule Canyon on the Staked Plain. They differ only from the presence of a median dorsal zigzag light stripe.
Baird’s figure represents this handsome form very well.

CNEMIDOPHORUS GRAHAMII STEJNEGERII Van Denburgh. Cnemidophorus stejnegeri VAN DENBURGH, Proce. Cal. Acad. Sci., IV, 1894, p. 300.
The following description is by Van Denburgh:
Adult male (Type No. 1861, Leland Stanford Junior University Museum, collected by J. M. Stowell between San Rafael and Ensenada, Lower California, June 8, 1893). Nostril anterior to nasal suture; 3 parietals, 2 frontoparietals, 4 supraoculars, 6 superciliaries; nasal not reaching second superior labial; postnasal in contact with both first and second superior labials. Posterior gular scales rather large, abruptly separated from the very large and convex anterior gulars. _ Plates of collar very large, but smaller along its edge. Ventral plates in eight longitudinal rows. Back, neck, and upper surfaces of limbs covered with very small, smooth, convex granules. Fiverows of brachial plates; three rows of antebrachials; no post-antebrachial plates. Femoralrowsinsevenrows. Twenty and twenty-two femoral pores. Scales on tail large, oblique, slightly pointed, and with strong diagonal keels.
Color above yellowish-hbrown posteriorly, becoming grayish toward head, paler on sides, with nine longitudinal rows of very irregular black spots. Upper surface of limbs similarly marked. Black markings on sides of head and neck and on gular region large and well defined. Lower surfaces creamy white, macalated with black.

<<<Page: 625>>>

Length, 343 mm.; head, 26 mm. ; hind leg, 70 mm.; fore leg, 37 mm.; tail, 252 mm.
Habitat.—Northwestern Lower California and San Diego County, California.
Twelve other specimens collected by Mr. Stowell at the type locality at San Telmo and in the foothills of the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, do not differ from the type in any important particular. The number of femoral pores varies from nineteen to twenty-five, of brachial plates from four to five rows, and of antebrachials from two to three rows.
Forty-one specimens from San Diego County, California (collected in Santa Ysabel, Clogstons, and Hemet valleys; at San Jacinto and in the Julian Mountains, by Messrs. Hyatt and Stoddard), are essentially like those from Lower California but average slightly paler in general coloration.
Cnemidophori from northern Lower California and from San Diego County, California, present much the general appearance of C. tigris undulatus (Hallowell). They differ from that form in having the dorsal scales smaller, the gular scales and the scales on the collar larger, and in the presence of large and well-defined black spots on the gular region. From C, tigris B. & G. they differ by character of the scales as above indicated, by the absence of the slate-colored suffusion on the gular regions, and by the weil-defined black markings on the side of the head.
The form does not appear to be very different from the C. grahamii grahamii, but the collar scales are somewhat differently arranged, and
the color is somewhat different. Mr. Van Denburgh has shown the characters to be constant in a large number of individuals.

Cnemidophorus guttatus HALLOWELL, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1854, p. 192.
This species is allied to the C. sexlineatus, but is distinguished by the presence of post-antebrachiai plates, the more numerous femoral pores and the longer muzzle. It is very variable as to size and color, but the dark spaces between the light stripes are always marked, interrupted or completely broken up by light spots or spaces, except in the young. The color variations are similar to those already mentioned under the head of the C. tessellatus, but they are more numerous. Specimens from western Texas come nearest in character to the C. sevlineatus. It takes the place of that species throughout Mexico, also replacing the 0. tessellatus in the drier parts of that country. Besides the characters already cited, this species differs from the C. tessellatus in its finer scales. These measure from .25 to .33 mm, in diameter, while those of
the C. tessellatus measure .5 mm.; but this character does not’ always hold good.

There are some color forms in the Lacerta muralis which are not repeated in the North American Cnemidophori, particularly those which result in a strong contrast between the dorsal colors as a whole and the darker lateral colors as a band. The color variety, No. 6, of the Cnemidophori is not reported by Kimer as occurring in the Lacerta muralis.

tinguish it from the C. sexlineatus, while the six longitudinal stripes ona dark ground have the same origins and terminations as in that species. The only difference in the squamation is seen in the presence of one or two rows of large scutes on the posterior face of the forearm. Accompanying this character is a larger number of femoral pores, which range from eighteen to twenty-two, averaging about twenty, as against sixteen and seventeen of the eastern form. Specimens having such characters generally have a single series of light spots in the dark spaces between the longitudinal stripes, which are not confluent with the light stripes, and which do not therefore break up the dark stripes into spots. The majority of such specimens have light spots on the sides below the inferior stripe. In some smaller specimens, presumably females and young, all the spots are wanting. In this subspecies the frenodcular plate occasionally appears. The general proportions are as in C. s. sexlineatus, the longest toe of the extended hind leg reaching to the front of the meatus auditorius. The size of adults exceeds a little that of the eastern form, a specimen from Arizona (Cat. No. 5020) measuring 100 mm. from the end of the snout to the vent. This is, however, larger than the average.
This form is found in western Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and in Mexico as far south as Chihuahua and Monterey.
Certain specimens agree in all respects with this subspecies, except in the possession of a smaller number of femoral pores. Such are Cat. Nos. 3055, 3022, 3006, 3010, 3071, 1871, and 9247. Cat. No. 3022 includes five specimens, which present the typical characters of the subspecies, but add a peculiarity, in which they all agree, namely, the possession of six infralabial plates, thus approaching the C. grahami. The males have the thoracic region black and the abdominal seales more or less margined with the same color. The same color character appears in a few other specimens, and in Cat. No. 15604 there are six infralabials
on one side. Cnemidophorus gularis gularis Baird and Girard.

This form resembles the C. s. sexlineatus more than any other, but always possesses the postantebrachial plates and more numerous femoral pores, which range from eighteen to twenty-two. Occasional specimens are, however, intermediate between the two. Its range is the Sonoran region.
Under this subspecies must be placed four of the series of forms which I described in my paper on the reptilia of Chihuahua as subspecies of the C. sexlineatus! in the following language, two of the forms (Nos. 5, 6) being the C. g. scalaris Cope:
1. Six longitudinal narrow stripes with unspotted interspaces..C. g. gularis (young).
2. Six stripes as above, the dark interspaces with small white spots... C. g. gularis verus. 3. Six stripes as above, wider and very obscure; small obscure spots,
C.g. gularis obsoletus.
4, Six stripes as above, but wider, and the spots enlarged so as to be confluent occa-
sionally with the light stripesi-25. 5. 2-26--2o-~ -22se0 sooo 2 2 ee 4c
‘‘Of the above forms all are numerously represented in the collection. The modification of the color pattern described is not entirely due to age, as some of the largest specimens belong to Nos. 2 and 3. Nevertheless small specimens predominate in the No. 1, and No, 4 presents a good many small specimens.” The specimens enumerated are as follows: ?
Subspecies No. 1; Cat. Nos. 14,236-41-49-69; 14,305.
Subspecies No. 2; Cat. Nos. 14,231-41,305-308.
Subspecies No. 3; Cat. Nos. 14,231-50-308.
Subspecies No. 4; Cat. Nos. 14,241-50-302-5.
These forms are not sexual, as several of them include both sexes.
Not having been fully persuaded of the distinction between the C. tessellatus and C. sevlineatus series, I used the name C, s. tigris for a “sixth subspecies” of the above table. The name was, however, misapplied, although the color pattern is identical with that of the C. tessellatus tigris Baird and Girard, with the exception that there are traces of six rapes instead of only four. The smaller specimens

? The numbers are attached to lots. by the recorder, and not to individuals, and are hence sometimes duplicated.

<<<Page: 630>>>

referred to, the C. s, sexlineatus, differ from that subspecies in having well-developed postantebrachial scales.
The gradation in the color characters given is complete, so that no subdivision into subspecies can be made. The case is exactly parallel with that of C. tessellatus tessellatus, except that there are here no individuals with the stripes entirely obliterated and complete transverse stripes posteriorly. (Such specimens are the (C. 9. scalaris ; see below.) The femoral pores are generally eighteen, but some have sixteen, seventeen, and twenty. In eleven of the specimens now before me seven have five infralabials and four have six. These numbers do not coincide with the color types.
Like other members of this genus this subspecies is extremely active in life. They are not easily caught by a single person, and I have spent considerable time in endeavoring to get near them on the staked plains of Texas. They play hide and seek for a time, and then take refuge in the hole of some fossorial mammal.

Muzzle moderately acuminate in adults; frenal plate about as high as long; frenodcular plate generally wanting. Brachial scales small, in eight rows; antebrachials in three; postantebrachials in two or three rows. Femoralsineightrows. The three large anal plates are bounded by several small plates laterally and in front. Femoral pores nineteen; in one eighteen, and in one seventeen. Longest toe of extended posterior leg reaching to front of auricular meatus. First and fifth toes measuring opposite to each other.
Ground color pale, on the sides posteriorly light rosy orange. The dark color only remains as narrow transverse black stripes which do not cross the middle line, which is occupied by a longitudinal series of spots. This is due to the fact that in the adults the black ground is completely broken up by the transverse extensions of the light stripes, which are quite traceable in the young. In some specimens the black spots do not fuse on the sides into transverse stripes (Cat. No. 14302). All the dark markings fade out on the limbs and sacral region, leaving a gray ground (in alcohol) which is marked with rosy orange spots. The lateral ventral plates and all those of the thorax with the posterior or concealed face of the anterior leg, are black or blackish in the adult.
Measurements (adult; tail injured).—Length to vent, 93 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 25 mm.; length to collar, 29 mm.; length to axilla, 26mm. Length of anterior limb, 30 mm.; length of fore foot, 14 mm. Length of hind limb, 67 mm.; length of hind foot, 37 mm.
Several specimens of this form are contained in the collection, and they agree closely in all respects. In coloration it is perhaps the most

ornamental of the genus. It is well distinguished from the C. grahamii in color characters, as well as in the presence of the well-developed postantebrachial scales. In the C. gularis it corresponds exactly in color characters with the tigris form of the C. tessellatus tessellatus, desig-nated in the plate of colors as D and H.
The only specimens that I have seen taken within the boundaries of the United States are Cat. Nos.17208 and 17210 from Arizona. Here all

the stripes are completely broken up, a trace of the pale ones remaining for a short distance in front of the groin on each side, and on each side of the dorsal median line posteriorly. The black is the ground color, and on the sides it is in more or less distinct transverse stripes. These specimens considerably resemble the C. g. communis Cope, but the latter has the light spots much less numerous, especially on the legs, and they are never confluent into transverse bars. The femoral pores are more humerous, ranging from nineteen to twenty-three, while in Cat. No. 17210

they number only fifteen, and in Cat. No, 17208, seventeen. There is no frenodrbital plate in the latter.

CNEMIDOPHORUS GULARIS SERICEUS COPE. Sun : Southwestern Texas. Cat. No, 8066, U.S.N.M.
Seales of the collar moderate, subequal, in four or five rows; marginal scales equal to the others. Mesoptychial scales considerably smaller than the gular scales, which are large, and extend from one ramus to the other. Scales of the back rounded, not prominent, small, measuring .33 mm. Supraorbital plates wider than long, except the anterior, and not separated from the frontaparietals by scales. Inter

<<<Page: 633>>>

parietal large, not twice as long as wide; parietals subtriangular, as wide as the interparietals, but much shorter. Frontoparietals remarkable for their small size and from their terminating each in an angle anteriorly, which receive between them the posterior apex of the frontal. They are smaller than the parietals, which are smaller than in other species. Infralabial plates six on each side, the last one small; the first pair separated at the posterior angle. Brachial scales in six rows; antebrachials in four. Femorals in seven, tibials in three rows. Femoral pores 21. The hind limb extended reaches to the posterior border of the orbit.
Measurements.—Size, medium. Length of head and body (tail injured), 81 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 22 mm.; to edge of collar, 26 min.; to axilla, 31 mm.; of fore limb, 26 mm.; of fore foot, 14 mm.; of hind leg, 60 mm.; of hind foot, 32 mm.
Ground color above anteriorly black, posteriorly olive. This is marked by six narrow lines of a paler olive, which represent the lines of the C. sexlineatus, with an additional median dorsal one. These fade out or become very indistinct on the lumbar and sacral regions. The interspaces, black anteriorly, are marked at first by small olive spots, but these enlarging, break up the black ground into spots, but these fade out on the middle of the length. The superior surfaces of the limbs and tail are olive, the latter unspotted; the hind limbs faintly spotted with paler above and posteriorly, and the forearm reticulated with black posteriorly. The dorsal stripes, except the three median, extend as far as the orbit. Rest of head olivaceous. Lower surface of body bluish olivaceous. Lower surface of head, limbs, and tail, yellow; the first named with a bluish transverse patch across the gular region.
This subspecies has various peculiarities. It differs from the other members of the C. sexlineatus series in the larger numbers and more equal size of the scales of the gular fold, approaching in this way the C. tessellatus, but not agreeing with it, since the marginal scales are not smaller. It differs from all the species in the small size of the interparietal and parietal plates. Its posterior legs are longer than in any species except the C. variolosus. No species has four rows (or three at the narrowest part) of antebrachial scales; the usual number being two to three; and the femorals are more numerous than in the C.g. gularis. The coloration is also quite distinctive. But one specimen is known, and that is from southwestern Texas. The discovery of other specimens will determine whether this is or is not a true species. In the obsolescence of the color pattern posteriorly it resembles the C. g. semifasciatus,

three large ones with eight to ten smaller ones on the sides and in front. The hind leg a little short, the longest toe when extended not reaching the meatus auditorius by the diameter of the latter.
Measurements.—Total length, 300 mm.; length to angle of mandible, 25 mm.; length to collar, 32 min; length to axilla, 42 mm.; length to vent, 100 mm.; length of fore limb, 30 mm.; length of fore foot, 13 mm. ; length of hind leg, 64 mm.; of hind foot, 35 mm.
The color is uniform olivaceous above and below, with the following black marks: There are three rows of black spots on each side of the middle line above; the superior small, subquadrate, the second larger and transverse, the inferior forming short crossbars. The superior row extends from the interscapular region to the middle of the length of the back; the second row extends further, and the inferior row extends nearly to the groin. Limbs, head, belly, and tail unspotted.
But two specimens are known to me. In Cat. No. 3033 the black spots are smaller and are restricted to the anterior fourth of the length of the body, being most distinct in front of the scapular region. Here traces of the original six stripes are visible between the spots.
This form has various peculiarities which entitle it to be regarded as a subspecies, and possibly as a species.
It is possible that it may be demonstrated that C. sericeus is established on a female of this species with abnormally reduced frontoparietal plates. The coloration is much like that of specimen Cat. No. 3033.

CNEMIDOPHORUS LABIALIS Stejneger. Cnemidophorus labialis STEJNEGER, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., XII, 1889, p. 643. The following description is copied from Stejneger:
Nasal in contact with second supralabial; postnasal and first supralabial not in contact; two large preanals, the largest behind; dorsal scales equal; nostril anterior to nasal suture; eight longitudinal rows of ventral plates; femoral pores twelve to thirteen; fronto-parietals distinct; supraoculars four; caudal scales slightly oblique.
Nostril anterior to nasal suture; three parietals; four supraoculars; seven supraciliares; a freno-orbital; two fronto-parietals; scales on middle of eyelid slightly enlarged, hexagonal; nasal in contact with second upper labial, postnasal and second upper labial being separated; posterior gular scales small, abruptly separated from the anterior, the line of demarkation between them being emphasized by the two rows nearest the latter being markedly smaller than the rest of the posterior ones; plates of the collar rather large, in several rows, the marginal largest; dorsal granules smooth, rather large; ventral plates in eight longitudinal and thirty-one transverse rows. Two large preanals, wider than high, the posterior plate being widest. Three rows of brachials of nearly the same size; antebrachials

<<<Page: 636>>>

continuous with brachials, in two rows, the outer one hardly larger; granules along posterior edge of under side of forearm but slightly enlarged. Five rows of femorals, outer largest; tibials in three rows, outer largest. Upper and lateral caudal scales slightly oblique, rather strongly keeled, and pointed posteriorly. Color above dark brown, with six longitudinal light lines and a median clay-colored band of the same shade as the top of the head; two light longitudinal lines on fore limbs and three on hind limbs; under side whitish, more or less suffused with bluish, especially on the flanks.
For dimensions, see table below.
In addition to the type, there are four other specimens which agree with it in all essential points; two of them have thirteen femoral pores, while two have only twelve; two have thirty-three rows of ventrals, one has thirty-one, and one thirty; three have three antebrachial rows, and in these the outer is by far the largest; two have only four femoral rows. In other respects the specimens are nearly identical.

He also adds the following remarks:
Of allour North American Cnemidophori this seems to be the most distinct species, Cnemidophorus (Verticaria) hyperythrus not even excepted. As will be seen from an enumeration of the characters by which it differs from them all, viz: The peculiar relations of the nasals and anterior labials, the arrangement of the preanals, the low number of femoral pores, twelve to thirteen, brachials in three subequal rows, femorals in only four to five rows. Of these the first-mentioned character seems even to be unique in the genus, as I have seen no meution of it in the descriptions of extralimital species, and after a careful examination of about three hundred specimens of the various North American forms, I can find no approach to the condition which is so characteristic of the present species, in all five specimens of which it is equally well pronounced. The low number of femoral pores is also well worth noting, inasmuch as it entirely destroys the usefulness of one of the sections of Boulenger’s key to the species (Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., I, pp. 360 and 361), relied upon to separate the South American species, C. ocellifer and multilineatus, from the other species with eight longitudinal rows of ventral plates and the nostrils opening in the nasal. The fusion of the two posterior preanals into one wide transversal plate seems to be another good character. It is true that this state of affairs is occasionally seen in specimens of OC. sexlineatus or its numerous subspecies, but the occurrence is rare, hardly reaching 2 per cent in the enormous series examined by me, while in the Cerros Island species it is normal, since found equally well represented in all tive specimens.

juxtaposed or imbricate, usually smaller than the ventrals, which form longitudinal and transverse series. (Boulenger.)
I have only had opportunity to examine the visceral anatomy of the genera Tachydromus, Lacerta, and Hremias. These possess a urinary bladder and a corpus adiposum, which projects freely into the abdominal cavity. The alimentary canal displays no colon. The liver is not elongate, and exhibits a small middle (third) lobe of the posterior
border. Its right lobe exhibits a recurved lobe from its extremity, which points posteriorly next the body wall. The mesenteries are of the usual or normal type of the order.
They inhabit Europe, Asia, and Africa; are absent from Madagascar, and most abundantly represented in Africa, with but few in the Kast Indies.
I have examined the hemipenis in the genera Lacerta, Acanthodactylus, and Laiastia. They are bifureate or bilobate. In each division and proximad to it is an oval area with transverse lamin and surrounded by a welt. In Acanthodactylus one of the areas is marked by longitudinal folds.

Boulenger describes this family as fellows:
Tongue moderately elongate, bifid posteriorly, free and very feebly nicked anteriorly, covered with inbricate scales ‘like papillee or oblique plice converging anteriorly towards the median line. Dentition pleurodont; teeth closely set, with long cylindrical shafts, hollow at the base, with conical or bicuspid crowns. Pterygoid teeth often present. Skull in every respect. similar to that of the Lacertide, with dermal ossification roofing over the supratemporal fosse. Limbs well developed or rudimentary. Clavicle dilated and loof-shaped proximally; interclavicle cruciform. Tail long and fragile. Head withsymmetrical shields. Body with squarish or rhomboidal imbricate scales, which often form regular longitudinal and transverse series; it is besides protected by osteodermal plates, underlying the scales, which show a system of longitudinal tubules intersecting a transverse one, as in the Scincide; this structure usually more distinct on the ventral plates than on the thicker and rougher dorsal ones. A lateral fold with granular scales, similar to that of Gerrhonotus, is present in all genera except Tracheloptychus, which in its sealing more resembles the Scines.
Femoral pores constantly present. Eyelids well developed. Tympanum distinct.
In the hemipenis in Gerrhosaurus nigrolineatus, there are on the distal third, three welts opposite the sulcus, the median larger, all finely cross folded. Between one of these and the sulcus is a tract of coarse papille; between the other and the sulcus the surface is smooth.
This family is exactly intermediate between the Lacertide (single premaxillary, femoral pores) and the Scincide (presence and structure of the dermal bony plates). It is strictly African, its headquarters being South Africa and Madagascar, and extending northward to the southern limit of Sahara.

Boulenger’s description is as follows:
Tongue moderately long, free and feebly nicked in front, covered with imbricate scale-like papille. Dentition pleurodont, teeth conical, bicuspid, or with spheroidal or compressed crowns; the new teeth hollow out the base of the old ones. Pterygoid teeth may be present.
Premaxilliary bones two, sometimes incompletely separated; nasal double; frontal single or double; parietal single; postorbital and postfrontotemporal arches complete, osseous; interorbital septurn and columella cranii well developed; infraorbital fossa present, bounded by the maxillary, the transverse bone, the palatine, and often also by the pterygoid. Skull with bony dermal plates overroofing the supratemporal fossa.
Limbs present or absent; pectoral and pelvic arches constantly present. Clavicle dilated and usually perforated proximally, interclavicle cruciform. Ossified abdominal ribs are absent.
Body protected by bony plates underlying the scales, which are cycloidhexagonal, rarely rhomboidal, imbricate, arranged quincuncially. These plates provided with symmetrical tubules, which usually consist of a transverse one anastomosing with several longitudinal ones. Head covered with symmetrical shields; an azygos occipital is rarely present. Pupil round. Eyelids well developed. No femoral pores.
Scincoids are cosmopolitan, the bulk occurring in Australia, the islands of the Pacific, the East Indies, and Africa; they are comparatively very poorly represented in South America. As far as we know at present, all species are ovoviviparous. Adaptations to every mode of life, save aquatic and aerial occur.
This family presents considerable variety in the details of the structure of the viscera. In such genera without internasal plates as I have

<<<Page: 641>>>

had opportunity to dissect, I have found no corpus adiposum, while this structure is well developed on the forms with supranasal plates. In serpentiform types, here as in the Anguide, the liver is situated more posterior to the heart, being separated from it by an interspace, which is not present in the strictly lacertiform types. I have only found a — colon in three types, the Australian Hgernia major, a pea green Liolepisma from some part of the Australian realm, and a Chalcides lineatus from Morocco. The Trachysaurus rugosus of Australia is remarkable for the shortness and large diameter of its alimentary canal, the diameter being similar all the way through, and the course being a simple sigmoid. In all other genera there is a small intestine distinct from the stomach and rectum, which is more or less plicated in its course.
The characteristics which I have observed may be tabulated as follows:
J. No corpus adiposum. A. No small intestine; liver three-lobed. Middle lobe of liver superior to the others and produced into a long strip.
Trachysaurus. AA. A plicate small intestine.

I have examined the hemipenis in Trachysaurus, Lepidothyris (fer. nandi). Euprepes (carinatus), Humeces and Mabuia. They are smooth and with more or less numerous longitudinal folds, excepting in Trachysaurus. Here the laminae diverge from the sulcus proximad and turn to a horizontal direction, meeting opposite the sulcus in a chevron directed distad. In Euprepis carinatus and Bumeces obsoletus some of the plicee are cross ribbed. In Lepidothyris fernandi the organ is shortly bifureate, and each division has a membranous welt next the adjaceut division.
I have examined the arches and limbs of the Chalcides lineatus with the following results:!
Scapular and pelvie arches present. Limbs of both pairs present, very short, with digits 3-3.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present, and presenting the true characters of the Leptoglossa, namely, clavicles distally dilated and perforate, and interclavicle cruciform. The scapula and coracoid are fused and osseous. The coracoid cartilage incloses a coracoid foramen, and coraco-precoracuid foramen with the cartilaginous precoracoid., Suprascapula large, cartilaginous. Sternum well developed, with cartilaginous borders, no foramen, and four costal articulations.
Pelvic arch.—All the elements present, but slender; the inferior arches directed anteriorly; the pubes in contact distally. The ischia are separated by a narrow membrane, which extends forward to the pubic symphysis. The ilium stands nearly vertical, its inferior portion articulating with the distaily fused extremities of the diapophyses of two vertebrie. Except in the slenderness of its parts, the pelvis is like that of Secincide with well developed limbs.
Viirbringer represents only three sterno-costal articulations in the C, tridactylus.
The food of the species of Scincide is principally insects. One exception to this is a pea-green species of Liolepisma from Australasia from whose alimentary canal I took some seeds resembling cherry stones.
The Evesia monodactyla Gray, from Ceylon, which is allied to Acontias, I found to present the following characters of the arches and limbs:
Scapular and pelvie arches present. Anterior and posterior limbs present, external, very rudimental, and undivided.
Scapular arch.—All the elements present. Sternum cartilaginous, with two costals; clavicles osseous, proximally simple. Interelavicle a simple, longitudinal, bony splint. Scapula and coracoid distinct; only ossified on their posterior borders. Coracoid and precoracoid cartilages not distinct, nor inclosing any fontanelles. Anterior limb consisting of a humerus with a minute cubital segment.
Pelvic arch.—Elements present subequal; the inferior directed forward, meeting on the middle line, without longitudinal connection.
' Journal of Morphology, 1892, p. 236.

<<<Page: 643>>>

llium directed slightly forward and upward, and articulating by its proximal extremity with the fused distal extremities of the diapophyses of two vertebra. Posterior limb exactly like the anterior, that is, consisting of a proximal element (femur) and a distal rudimental segment.
Fiirbringer! describes and figures the shoulder and pelvic girdles of Acontias meleagris aud A. plumbeus. The shoulder girdles consist of simple elements supposed to represent scapule, fused or not on the middle line, the median portion of which, in the A. plumbeus, it is suggested, may be clavicles. The pelvic girdles consist, in both species, of a simple element on each side, consisting of ilium (joined to vertebre) and supposed pubis. My examination of Hvesia shows the impropriety of combining that genus with Acontias, as has been done by Boulenger.
As in other families, in the serpentiform types the liver and stomach occupy @ position caudad to the lungs, and so the latter do not appear in the mesenteric connections of the former; as, for instance, Siaphos. The mesenteries are the usual ones, but one peculiarity is very frequent, though not universal in the family. The hepatoventral sheet is generally divided into two, a right and a left sheet, next the liver, forming a pocket, which opens caudad. In the Tiliqua scincoides the two sheets only unite at the cephalic end of the liver, remaining separate througheut.
Dr. Boulenger remarks as to this family:
I have met with great difficulty in arranging the genera of this family. The majority of the characters hitherto employed for the distinction of genera, such as the degree of development of the limbs, the presence or absence of a transparent disc in the lower eyelid, the presence or absence of keels on scales, etc., are in many cases not even of specific value. I have therefore used certain characters which hitherto have been neglected, but which, I am convinced, afford a firmer basis for a natural arrangement. The artificial nature of an arrangement based on the degree of the development of the limbs has been pointed out by others. In a family like the Scincoids, in which the limbs are undergoing a process of abortion, this character must be abandoned as one expressing relationship by itself. And I trust that the arrangement of the species in one or more series within a genus, passing from forms with well developed pentadactyle limbs and lacertiform physiognomy to such as have rudimentary limbs, or even none at all, marks a great improvement upon the artificial classifications in use down to the present day.
I am not prepared to admit that the above remarks of Dr. Boulenger have more than an application to the cases where the development of the limbs and digits is irregular in the same species. This has not been shown to be the case more frequently than we expected to find in all other zoological characters, and particularly those which we call generic. It is indeed precisely the grades of characters expressed by the last structural modification of parts that the generic nomenclature is created to record. So long as the characters are constant then it is

LIOLEPISMA Duméril and Bibron.
Liolepisma DUM®RIL and Brsron, Erp. Gén., V, 1839, p. 742.—GRay, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 1845, p. 84.
Oligosoma GIRARD, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1857, pp. 196-245; U.S. Expl. Exp., Herp., p. 235.
Nostril pierced in the nasal plate. Palatine bones in contact on the median line of the palate. Tympanum not covered with integument, Pterygoid bones in contact on the middle line. Eyelids movable; digits with nonretractile claws. Supranasal plates wanting. Lower eyelid with a transparent disk; two frontoparietal plates; digits 5-5.
This genus embraces twenty-eight species, all of which are referred to Lygosoma, Section IV, in Boulenger’s Catalogue of the Lizards in the British Museum. Of these, five are from New Zealand; five are from Australia and adjacent islands; four are from the Pacific islands and New Guinea; three are from the Philippines; six are from India; one from the Mauritius; two from West Africa; and one, the species described below, is from North America, and, according to Boulenger, from China. South America and (excepting China) the temperate parts of Asia and Europe are not. possessed of any species of Liolepisma.
The genus is markedly different from Humeces in the absence of internasals, the frontal coming broadly in contact with the rostral as well as the nasals. The palate has a triangular notch running to a point instead of being more linear and hollowed anteriorly. There are no pterygoid teeth as in Humeces. The tongue appears flatter and more extensible at the tip.

Body slender, quadrangular; vent rounded, attenuated one and onehalf times the body; frontal in contact behind with the vertical, before with the rostral; the prefrontals small; lateral. Nasal above the first labial, in contact above with the internasal; the postnasal and one loral in contact with the postfrontal. Seven upper labials. Ears large, vertical. Lower eyelid transparent in the center; without scales.
Scales very thin and membranous; generally 28 rows around the

<<<Page: 648>>>

body. The hind legs applied twice forward reach halfway between arm and ear; contained three times in head and body. Fifth hind toe shorter than second. Free portion of longest toe half the head.
Upper parts of head and body uniform reddish olive, sometimes bronzed or greenish for a width of about six rows of scales. This on the edges changes indistinctly to a light line, which appears to be on the adjacent edges of two rows of scales. Immediately below this is a blackish lateral stripe from the nose and through the eye about 12 seales wide, with or without a white line below it, and below the sides are striped alternately with dusky and lighter. Under parts yellowish white with faint lines along the adjacent edge of scales. Tail sometimes greenish or pale livid beneath.
The color varies above to a considerable extent, Qo and sometimes (including the top of head) is irregularly spotted with blackish. The upper lateral dusky stripe is well defined above, someA057 times very faint below. The alternating dark and light lines are sometimes quite uniform i dusky or dusky, dotted with lighter by the breaking up of the light lines. The scales beneath have generally a bronzed or brassy reflection, se, and the lines along the junction of the rows of Pte neato scales sometimes quite distinct. Sometimes Gat, No. 4971, U.S.NM. there are faint traces of light lines along the centers of the dorsal rows of scales. There may generally be detected two light lines below the dark lateral band 1 to13 scales apart, after which each row of scales is light along the center and finely mottled externally.
The lower edge of the larger lateral dusky stripe is frequently effaced. The dark spots on the dorsal surface sometimes exhibit a tendency to linear arrangement in two series.
I can not distinguish Texas specimens from more Eastern ones, though it is possible that, if the outlines of the scales and plates were more distinct, characteristic features might be found. The lateral black Stripes are perhaps better defined and the arrangement of the dorsal dark specks into ten series more marked.
Cat. No, 3152, from Arkansas, collected by Dr. Woodhouse, differs in having the broad dorsal band divided into three, a central darker covering four rows of scales and two lateral lighter two-thirds as wide. The central stripe is darker externally and rather more so along the center, and may almost be considered as formed of lines, or three lines, the breaking of which may be considered as producing the dots found in some specimens, and as illustrating the primary pattern of coloration (two dark lines along the middle of the back, two rows of scales apart).
This species ranges over the Austroriparian region, extending into the Carolinian district of the Eastern as faras Burlington County, New

<<<Page: 649>>>

Jersey, where it has been taken by Dr. J. Percy Moore. It extends up the Mississippi Valley into southern Illinois and Indiana, and is found everywhere in Texas as far southwest as the Nueces River. A large form inhabiting eastern Mexico I have called L. gemingerii. Boulenger does not regard it as distinct.

Nostril pierced in the nasal plate. Palatine and pterygoid bones separated on the median line of the palate, the latter with teeth. Supranasal plates present. Limbs pentadactyle, the digits not denticulated laterally.
The preceding characters define a natural genus. The following are also common to the species: The nostrils are lateral. The postnasals vary. There are either one or two; if the latter, one may be directly above the other, or the second may be both behind and above the first. The head is covered with ossified plates concealing the muscles and with an external epidermis. The tongue is thick, elongate, cordate or arrow-shaped, slightly notched anteriorly, and quite homogeneously squamous throughout. The flap covering the anus is margined behind by two large plates, with smaller ones on either side.
Osteology.—For the determination of the skeletal characters of this genus I have skeletons of the HL. obsoletus and EH. quinquelineatus from the national collection.
The premaxillary is split as in other Scincide, and the halves are in the closest contact. The common spine is rather elongate, while the palatal suture is simply emarginate. The nasals are not shortened, and are distinct. The frontal is double, and is simply grooved on the middle line below. The parietal is single, and is pierced by the pineal foramen at aboutits middle. The parietoquadrate arch is well elevated. The supraoccipital is loosely articulated, presenting a truncate median process toward, but not to, a median notch of the parietal. Exocciptals distinct by suture. Prefrontal rather large, not sending posteriorly a supercilliary process, and not produced far above the orbit. Lachrymal small; not, or very little, visible on external facial surface, and reached by a long internal process of the jugal. External surface of jugal separated widely from prefrontal, its postorbital portion much longer, slender, and rising to meet the postfrontal. The latter is large and unequally V-shaped, the posterior limb broad and covering the temporal fossa between the parietal and supratemporal bones, with more or less of a fissure next the parietal posteriorly. Postfrontal a splint Separating the jugal and supratemporal from the postfrontal. Supratemporal well produced anteriorly, and in contact with the parietoquadrate arch for the posterior two-thirds the length of the latter. Quadrate with one, a deep external, conch. The vomers are elongate, and also expanded laterally, passing above the prominent palatine lamin of the maxillary, bones. They are in close apposition on the median line, but are so swollen longitudinally as to leave a groove at the common suture. The longitudinal ribs terminate in a pair of appressed hooks, which look downward and backward at the posterior extremities of the bones. The vomerine branch of the palatine is not

<<<Page: 651>>>

quite as long as the maxillary branch, and is ona superior plane, being in close contact with its mate on the middle line, and forming with the maxillary plate a half tube opening inward. Pterygoids not very wide, gradually narrowing to the posterior rod, which is openly grooved on the inner side. The basipterygoid processes overlap the entire width | of the internal face. Ectopterygoid reaching maxillary and jugal, but not palatine; little deflected posteriorly. Presphenoid not ossified; sphenoid distinguished from basioccipital by suture. Latter with sub‘conic descending lateral processes, which inclose a deep fossa on the external side. Postoptic small, simple, crescentic. Petrosal extended well in advance of semicircular canal above; subforaminal portion still more produced, bounding a down looking open groove. Parietal sending downward a rather elongate process in front of petrosal. Epipterygoid originating opposite basipterygoid below, and resting above on the descending process of the parietal and the anterior margin of the petrosal. Occipital condyle tripartite.
Meckel’s cartilage exposed from the anteriorly placed splenial foramen. Coronoid a little produced anteriorly on external face of ramus, not at all posteriorly. Surangular and articular distinct; angle flat, rounded, not produced or angular inward. Dentary produced as far posteriorly as coronoid; splenial rather elongate (forming the inferior border of Meckel’s groove in H. obsoletus).
In the hyoid system, H. quinquelineatus preseuts a Short second ceratobranchial. The first ceratobranchial has a cartilaginous terminal segment, as has also the ceratohyal. The latter is of moderate length, is without expansions, and is articulated with the extremity of the rather short hypobranchial. There is a large free epibranchial, which commences near the free extremity of the second ceratobranchial, and curying backward, outward and then forward, Mone en nearly opposite the middle of the ceratohyal.
The cervical intercentra in the Z. obsoletus number four, and those of the H. quinquelinetus three, posterior to that of the atlas. There is no
zygosphene. The caudal diapophyses are well developed at the base
of the series, and are split lengthwise at the middle and distal part of the series by the segmentation of the vertebra. Neural spine single at posterior extremity of neural arch.
The suprascapula is expanded anteroposteriorly, and the scapula is rather elongate. The latter has no proscapula, while the coronoid has one emargination. The sternum has a small fontanelle posteriorly placed. There are three costal articulations and a xiphoid rod with two ribs. The latter is in close apposition to its mate, and is expanded outward at the junction of the first hemapophysis.
The ilium has no angulus criste, and the acetabulum is entire. The pubes converge at a subacute angle, and the small pectineal process is nearer the proximal extremity, and is turned downward. The ischia are subtransverse, and present a wide emargination posteriorly, since the processus tuberosus is near the acetabulum.

<<<Page: 652>>>

Besides the family characters, this genus is well distinguished among American lizards by the divided frontal; the overroofing the temporal fossa by the postfrontal and supratemporal; the descending process of the parietal; forms of the xiphoid rods, and forms of the pelvic bones.
In the latest enumeration of the species of this genus, that of Boulenger, thirty-one species are included. These are distributed as follows:

For purposes of analysis, the North American species may be arranged in four groups, which have the following characters:

It may be also stated here that all the species have four supraorbital plates except FL. egregius, which has but three. Also that H. longirostris has more numerous scales than any other species, as they are in 56-34 rows; while in H. egregius the number of scale rows is smaller than in any species, reaching only twenty-two.
The form of the postnasal plate presents considerable variation in some species. This is especially the case in FE. multivirgatus, where it may or may not reach the supranasal, and is sometimes directly under the prefrenal. The opposite sides are sometimes slightly different. In some species with two mentals they may be sometimes abnormally fused together.
All the North American skinks lose these distinctive marks of color with age. All are dark, nearly black, when young, varied with white lines or spots, which leave a trace of their presence when old. Three of the labials, the upper especially, are black, with white centers. There is always retained a dusky border to the lateral edges. If the edge of the upper jaw be white the character is never lost, the labials never having darker lateral borders. ‘The light lines in increasing age generally remain for a time and are bordered by blackish or dark brown, the interspaces generally becoming light olive. Even these, however, gradually disappear, and the scales generally are olivaceous above, with dusky borders, especially where originally dark colored.
The following arrangement may be considered as defining the species with two unequal postnasals by the color of the young:
A. Upper labials plain whitish; ground color black above, bluish beneath; beneath head white.

Interoccipital large, rounded posteriorly, very acute anteriorly. Frontoparietal plates geminiform, in contact by their inner angles. Supraoculars four; anterior supraocular small, barely or not in contact with the frontonasal. Inferior palpebra granular; a series of six to eight vertical scales beneath the marginal row. Supranasals large, considerably in contact; internasal transverse, subtruncate posteriorly; frontonasals as long or more frequently lounger than broad, extensively in contact. Frontal elongate, in front obtuse, posteriorly acute angled. Inferior labials, seven; symphyseal deeper than in EF. quinquelineatus; one large seven-sided mental in contact with two labials on each side, two infralabials posteriorly, and the Symphyseal anteriorly.

not separated by a postmental. Three slightly prominent granules upon the superior part of anterior auricular border. Digits compressed; of the posterior the fourth has twice the extent of the fifth. Sole tuberculous externally and internally; medially granular; palm tuberculous posteriorly. Scales small, especially upon the sides; rows from thirtynine to forty-two. Preanal plates, four; the median very large, the exterior very small. Total length, 162 mm.; tail, 95 mm.
Color above, from rusty to ashy brown, paler on the tail. A white line begins at the anterior angle of the orbit, and extending above the latter reaches as far as the crural region. It is margined with black superiorly, and separated from that of the opposite side by eight rows of scales. Beneath it the sides are black or brownish for a width of three and a half scales, beneath which shade is another white line extending from beneath the orbit to the groin. The dark color of the sides extends upon the tail for one third its length. The under surface of this member, of the extremities and belly, greenish blue; throat and chin yellowish. In younger specimens a light line upon each canthus rostralis is analagous to those which unite and form the median dorsal band in H. quinquelineatus. There are nearly ten more rows of scales in this species than in H. quinquelineatus, and there is only one mental. The latter species has six preanal plates, of which the median pair is not so disproportionately large; also the frenals and nasofrenal are narrow and erect.
We are informed by Mr. J. M. Jones, in his Naturalist in Bermuda, that a species of ‘“‘Scincus” inhabits the islands, and that it is the only indigenous true reptile. He notices its resemblance to EH. quinquelineatus (‘*S. fasciatus”) of the United States, and gives a description of an old male specimen.

Free portion of long hind toe nearly three-fourths the side of head to ear; the fifth toe decidedly longer than the second.
Coloration. 1. Black above, including the head, with five equidistant narrow whitish stripes, a dorsal and two lateral; the median bifurcating at the occiput, the branches uniting at the rostrum. Each line usually on adjacent edges of the rows of scales (occupying half or third) and separated by one, sometimes two, rows of the ground color (** fasciatus”).
2. The rest of the scales through which the three middle stripes run, black; the intervening scales light olive; the cephalic white line then fainter, and next the dorsal, until the whole space between the upper lateral stripes is olivaceous, with four dusky lines of dots along the middle of scales, head becoming reddish and wider (‘ quinquelineatus”).

<<<Page: 659>>>

3. Lateral stripes and dusky band becoming obliterated, first the upper then the lower, the head swelling still more; finally the body uniform greenish or reddish olive, whitish beneath, the head as broad as long and bright brick red.
Of these stages the first is confined to very young (less than 50 mm. or 62.5 mm.). The red and broad-headed individuals, without distinct stripes, of whatever size, are males; the largest, with narrow head and distinct stripes, are females.
More northern specimens do not appear to assume the red head and plain coloration.
In Cat. No. 3129 the plates of the head are much as described in P. skiltonianus. The legs are much longer, the hinder applied twice for-

ward reaching a little beyond the eye; from knee contained three times in head and body or reaching halfway from root, two and one-sixth from head to between fore legs. Foreleg from elbow one and one-fifth times the head to ear, which is contained four and one-half times in head and body, which again is contained one and one-half timesin the tail. The width of head is two-thirds the length to ear. The body at the middle is encircled by twenty-eight rows of scales, and there are fifty-six from head to tail.
Other specimens, however, vary considerably from this standard. Thus the number of dorsal rows appears to vary up to thirty-four, the highest I have yet observed, every intermediate number occurring from twenty-eight, the smallest. The longitudinal dorsal number is generally fifty-five or fifty-six. With advancing age the head becomes

<<<Page: 660>>>

broader behind, until in the ‘‘laticeps” its width is equal to the length above, and laterally to the distance from nostril to ear. The unusual expansion is chiefly in the cheeks, which are wider from above downward, and are completely ossified.
The general color of head and body above is a dark olive green, with five nearly or quite equidistant bluish or greenish white stripes, one median and two lateral on each side, becoming blue on the tail and extending to the tip. The stripes are all of equal width, a little more than one-third the width of their intervals, and occupy rather less than the adjacent halves of contiguous rows of scales, sometimes only onethird. Between each stripe is a row of perfectly plain scales; the remainder of the white-streaked “rows being black. The interval between the two lateral white stripes is black; the others are all margined by a line of black on the rest of the row of scales as stated, leaving on the back two dorsal rows, one on each side the median line, dark olive. Beneath the lower white stripe is an obscure dusky streak. The under parts are light salmon, tinged with bluish on the belly and sides of tail.
The lowest lateral stripe begins on the upper labials and runs through the ear; the upper starts on the canthus rostralis a little in front of the eye. The median bifurcates at the occiput, sending two branches forward along the edge of the vertical, and uniting in a gentle curve at the rostral. :
There is a white line down the posterior face of the thigh and another on the anterior face, both confluent with the lower lateral stripe, and becoming more broken on the tibial portion. The fore legs appear slightly spotted also.
In some specimens, as Cat. No. 3129), the white lateral stripes above the fore leg run obliquely from one row of scales to another; one upper lateral stripe passes along the middle of the fourth row of scales from the median line of back, leaving two olive-colored rows, while its fellow on the opposite side is more as described.
In many, in fact, in most specimens, the light stripe on the anterior face of the thigh is wanting. The upper lateral stripe does not always bound the exterior of the third row of seales from the middle of the back, but is frequently confined to the fourth, especially posteriorly, the line sometimes, as already stated, crossing from one row to the other. The ground color is sometimes entirely black; the stripes yellowish or golden.
[ have in the preceding paragraphs confined my attention to the very young specimens usually known as the Humeces fasciatuus. With increasing age the stripes ou the head become obscure and then disappear entirely, the head assuming more or less of a reddish tinge. The cheeks expand and become tinged, especially below and behind, where the large plates are ultimately folded into the cavity of the ear and the two or three floating triangular scales affixed along its anterior edge

<<<Page: 661>>>

are completely concealed or sometimes more or less blunted, contracted, or obliterated. With the disappearance of the cephalic stripes the median dorsal first becomes obscure; the ground color changes from black or narrow dorsal olive stripes to predominant light olivaceous. For a considerable time the black on the sides remains distinct and continuous, but ultimately is reduced to dusky margins to the scales, Sometimes the lateral whitish stripes disappear or are very obsolete, the black stripe remaining distinct; or the reverse may be the case. The lateral light lines are, however, quite late to disappear entirely. There is often a trace of the original black above in a line of dusky dots down the middle of the two dorsal rows of seales, and that of the third or fourth row from the central line of the back, formerly continuous stripes bordering the white. By degrees the lateral stripes become more and more obsolete, until there is only the faintest trace or they have disappeared entirely, leaving the body of a uniform greenish or reddish olive above and a light brick-red head as broad as long. The lowest lateral white stripe can usually be detected on oldest specimens as well as some of the dusky of the sides; the scales of the back, however, become entirely uniform.
In Cat. No. 4136 there is a distinct whitish stripe between the legs below what is ordinarily the lowest, making three on each side, the dorsal wanting. This is seen more or less distinctly in other specimens, as Cat. No. 3178, théugh usually wanting. The various changes described do not appear to progress uniformly in all specimens. Sometimes a series of specimens of the same size will exhibit all the stages, except the earliest.
Professor Baird has shown that the Scincus erythrocephalus, quinquelineatus, and fasciatus are forms of the same species, the first name having been given to old males.
From the preceding remarks it will be seen that I have adopted his opinion, combining in one all the three species described by Dr. Holbrook as inhabiting the United States. This I have only done after a protracted examination of a large series of specimens from all parts of the United States. I have failed to find any constant distinctions in the external structure and relative proportions, while the differences of coloration are only those readily attributable to age and sex. It is well known that the characteristic markings of the skinks are most appreciable in the young. Now, in the present case none except the very largest have the coloration of erythrocephalus, none except the middle and the largest size (females) that of quinquelineatus, while every one before me with a head and body of less than 2 or 24 inches agrees exactly in coloration with the most typical fasciatus. To sum up the whole case, I feel very confident that the three (or four, including Dr. Hallowell’s P. vittigerum?) supposed species in reality constitute but one; that the species attains a much larger size in the more Southern States than the Northern, there going through all the stages of colora

<<<Page: 662>>>

tion, and that the farther north the more is this restricted to the primary pattern.
Furthermore, it is probable, or even almost certain, that the females retain their stripes and other markings longer than the males, and have a much less tendency, if they exhibit it at all, to reddening and widening of the head, which would explain the differences in size of specimens otherwise similarly colored. It is almost certain that females never entirely lose their stripes and never assume the very wide head. A series (Cat. No. 4137) of three from Tyree Springs, Tennessee, though evidently the same species and of the same size (body and head nearly 4 inches) represents very fairly the so-called P. erythrocephalus and quinquelineatus, the former being males, the latter female. As far as I have made anatomical examination, all the largest specimens (head ‘and body 4 inches) of those with narrow head and distinct stripes (as Cat. No. 4136) are females; all those of same or even less size, with very broad, red head and obscure markings (as Cat. No. 4138) are males, and I have no doubt this may be taken as a rule in the present case.
A figure of the details of the female is No. 3, page 177, of this book. The specimen is from Florida.
The most northern, as at the same time the smallest, specimens having more the character of P. laticeps or erythrocephalus than that of the others, is in bottle Cat. No. 3150, trom Carlisle. The head and body of these barely measure 5 inches, and they were captured by myself in the same locality and at the same time with others of the same size agreeing with S. quinquelineatus. The former are males, the latter females, as Shown by actual examination.
The Plestiodon vittigerum of Hallowell from Michigan! belongs to the middle stage of this species, var. polygrammus. In a large number of small skinks with median white line before me there is one which, in most respects like the small blue skinks, differs in having the fine bluish white lines on a black ground very narrow; the hind legs uniform black without any stripe. There is a third lateral stripe on each side, between the fore and hind legs, less distinct than the other, and a Short light stripe on each side the median one on the back of the neck. This is along the adjacent edges of the first and second row of scales from the median line, the inner edge of this first row involved in the median stripe. The posterior extremity of the oval light outline on the head above, instead of being connected with the end of the dorsal Stripe as its bifurcation, has the two branches curved outward, as a quarter circle, and connecting with the two supplementary short cervical stripes and not at all with the median. The belly is bluish, becoming white on the under surface of head; the rostral plate and sides of head anterior to the eye are white.
I do not venture, in the absence of more specimens, to consider this as a distinct species; it, however, is markedly different in the character
' Proce. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., VIII, 1856, p. 310.

<<<Page: 663>>>

of its stripes from any other before me. Its locality (Colonels Island, off the coast of Georgia, and not on the main land) is to be duly considered.
The Eumeces quinquelineatus is distributed throughout the eastern district, with the exception of the Canadian and Hudsonian subdistricts, and throughout the austroriparian, excepting the Texan district. The most northern locality from which I have seen a specimen is Michigan, as pointed out by Hallowell. Of its occurrence in Massachusetts, Prof. J. A. Allen wrote in 1868:
A specimen is said by Dr. Storer to have been sent him from Barre, and to have been found in amud hole in that place by Dr. Joseph N. Bates. Mr. Linsley'! givesit as occurring occasionally near New Haven. Dr. De Kay says it is not uncommon in the southern counties of the State of New York, but Massachusetts is quite beyond its usual northern range, and it can be expected to occur there but rarely.
It is rare in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Texas I have it from Dallas, but have not seen or heard of it west of that locality.
In its movements the Humeces quinquelineatus is active, but not nearly as much so as the Sceloporus undulatus of the same region. I kept a specimen in confinement for a considerable time. After it had been without food I introduced into the vivarium with it a number of wood lice (Oniscus sp.). Soon after, Il observed the Humeces performing extraordinary movements, leaping about, turning somersaults, and rolling over. It soon became quiescent and died. On examination I found in its alimentary canal aggregations of the shells of the wood lice, and at other points bladder-like expansions of the intestine, inclosed by constrictions. The contents of the canal were fetid, and it was apparent that the lizard had gorged itself with the Onisci, which it had been unable to pass. The result was decomposition, accumulations of gas, and death from wind colic. The gyrations of the reptile render it evident that the disorder was no less painful to it than it is to mammals under the same conditions.
Systematic authors generally have given this species as an inhabitant of Japan, and commented upon the fact as aremarkable exception to the usual laws of geographical distribution. I have examined a specimen from Simoda, Japan, and I have not the slightest hesitation in pronouncing the species distinct. The postnasal is divided into two plates, one above the other, instead of one, as in H. quinquelineatus, together forming a narrow and high plate, as in EH. septentrionalis. There is but one postmental plate. The frontal is smaller and scarcely or not at all in contact with the postnasal. The scales are much larger; the ten central above abruptly larger than the lateral. There are 24¢r 25encircling the body. The upper lateral stripe runs through the middle of the third row of scales from the central line (nearest the upper edge) and the two upper lateral are separated by but four rows of scales. In quinquelineatus the upper white stripe is generally along the adja-

them instead of the four. the posterior face of the thigh seen in quinquelineatus.

partly on the second labial; this succeeded by a second, twice its area and height; higher and half as long as the loreal and in contact with both frontals and postfrontals. Upper labials, seven or eight. The two central rows of dorsal scales are abruptly larger than the next. Twenty-four or twenty-six rows of scales around body, and about sixty-three from head to tail.
Young, clear olive, with two white stripes on each side, inclosing a black space, and the upper bordered above by a black line; the lower with one less defined. The stripes on adjacent edges of two rows of scales, the middle of the two lower, stripes ten or twelve scales apart across the back. Back with two median rows of olive scales. Upper stripes involving exterior half or third of the second row from the middle, and not half as wide as their interspace. Legs without stripes;
Fig. 126. EUMECES SKILTONIANUS BAIRD AND GIRARD. x 5. Califoruia. Cat. No, 11756, U.S.N.M.
with age the stripes become more or less effaced; the head above reddish olive. In variety amblygrammus the white stripes broader, occupying adjacent two-thirds of two rows of scales, the upper stripes half the width of their dorsal interspace, which is uniformly black.
Limbs short; hind leg, from knee, contained three and one-half times in head and body. The fifth hind toe is rather shorter than second, the free portion of longest about two-thirds the side of head.
In Cat. No. 3172a, the type, there are twenty-five to twenty-seven rows of scales around the body, varying with the region, and fifty-eight to sixty-three from occiput to above anus. The hind leg reaches forward halfway to the middle of the insertion of the arm; the forelegs only to the gape of the mouth. The hind leg, from knee, is contained about three and two-thirds times in head and body; the head to ear five and one-half times. The arm, from elbow, is about equal to head to ear.

<<<Page: 667>>>

Tail broken at tip, but apparently about one and one-third times the head and body. The tailis strictly tetragonal and equilateral to the end. In nearly all good specimens, however, it is cylindrical.
In Cat. No. 3172b, from same locality with the type, but of considerably smaller size, there are twenty-six rows of scales around the body and sixty-three from occiput to anus. The hind leg applied forward twice reaches halfway between the arm and the ear, the forelegs to the gape: The hind leg, from knee, is contained rather less than three and one-half times in the head and body; the head to ear about five times; the tail is trihedral, the base above and smaller than the sides. From this it appears that the older specimens have the body proportionally rather more elongated than in younger; the tail longer.
There appears to be a considerable difference in the size of the limbs, especially the hinder. This is smaller in the type of Dr. Hallowell’s EHumeces quadrilineatus than in most other specimens. The head never appears to become very broad, not exceeding two-thirds the length to ear.
The prevailing color of this species is a greenish olive above, with four white or greenish-white stripes, the space between the two lateral black, the upper stripe bordered internally with black. The stripes on the back are separated by an interval one and one-half times that between the two lateral. On the back are two central rows of scales of the ground color, each sometimes with a narrow posterior border of dusky or black. The white stripe on either side occupies the outer third (or angular portion) of the adjacent row of scales, and the inner half of the next outer (or of the third from the median line) the inner half of the second row from the median line black, forming the line just mentioned. The black -lateral stripe occupies 23 scales on the sides, succeeded inferiorly by a white stripe two half scales wide, or rather on the lower third of one row and the upper half of the next. Between the centers of the two lower lateral stripes on either side there thus intervene twelve rows of scales. The under parts are of a light salmon color, the belly and sides of the body dull bluish.
Another specimen (Cat. No. 3131) has the lower lateral stripe on one row higher up, leaving but 12 in the dark part, or ten from its middle to that of the fellow across the back. There are but twenty-four rows of scales around the body. Here, as in the other, the upper white stripe begins on the canthus rostralis, just behind the nostrils but rather indistinct to above the eye. The second begins along the upper labials and runs back through the ear, and above the insertions of the limbs. Both are quite distinct on the tail, where this has not been reproduced, the ground color being rather bluish.
With advancing age the clearness of the markings disappears, and
_there is at first only a line of black spots on the back on the inner half of the second row of scales from the middle of the back, two full rows intervening between the two. This is a remnant of the black border

ing internally the upper white stripe, which is faintly traceable. Then comes a dusky lateral stripe, each scale, however, with a little olive at the base. The lower white stripe is very faint. This is the coloration in the type specimen Cat. No. 3172a. In the largest specimen, Cat. No. 318la, the upper parts are entirely uniform olive, lighter than in the young, the four and five rows from the middle of the back having the scales edged slightly with brown. The middle row of large scales beneath the tail is plain light-salmon color, the line connecting it with the adjacent rows dusky. In old specimens the limbs are shorter, relatively, than in young ones. In the latter, when appressed to the sides, they touch or overlap a little, but in old and large ones they may be separated by a space equal to the length of the hand.
Var. amblygrammus.—A specimen from Fort Humboldt (Cat. No. 166) differs from others before me from California in having the dorsal interspace uniformly and continuously black as well as the sides; the four bluish-white stripes are very sharply defined, the upper from the nostril. The upper lateral stripe occupies the adjacent two-thirds of the second and third rows of scales from middle of back and is half as wide as the black dorsal interspace. In all other specimens the upper light stripe occupies at most onty adjacent halves of scales, usually only adjacent thirds (especially above), and the width is one-half the dorsal band, which is always olive edged with biack.
i have seen the Humeces skiltonianus from Cape St. Lucas, Lower California, on the south, to near the Canadian boundary on the north. It is quite abundant and is active in its movements, frequently exposing itself in the open sunshine.
Dr. Merriam notes in his report on the Death Valley expedition that “specimens of this small lizard were obtained in the Panamint and Argus ranges in the Great Basin, and in Kern River Valley and the Canada de las Uvas (near old Fort Tejon) on the coastal slope of the Great Divide in California.”
Var. brevipes.—In a large and probably old specimen (Cat. No. 12558) there is but one mental plate, and the limbs are considerably shorter than in the adult of the typical form. The color is also modified in a way which is different from that seen in other adults. Additional specimens are necessary to determine the question of the rank of this form. It diverges, however, so widely from the normal that I deseribe it under a distinct name.
The limbs, appressed to the sides, do not meet by a space equal to the length of the forearm and hand, which is more than double the space between the limbs in the adults of the typical variety. The hind limb is one-third the length from the groin to the end of the muzzle. The tail is unusually robust, but the extremity is lost in the specimen. In coloration the dorsal ten rows of scales are all alike, dark olive, bordered with brown. There is a pale spot on the outer border of the scales of the third row from the median line on each side, which gives

<<<Page: 669>>>

the impression of an indistinct narrow pale streak. Belly and posterior gular region blue; chin, throat, a crossband at axilla, and the inferior
surfaces of limbs and tail, light yellow.
The external border of the
broad median row of subcaudal scales (which are twice as wide as those of the adjacent rows) are bordered with plumbeous, forming two
narrow streaks.
The scales of the upper side of the tail are brown
bordered. The dimensions equal those of the largest adults of the
usual type.

Plates of head generally similar to those of P. quinquelineatus. 'The frontal small, transversely lozenge-shaped, and about equal to the postfrontals. Quite acute laterally, where it touches the posterior postnasal. This is higher than the loreal and is about twice the area of the anterior post nasal passing above it, the two of about the same length and together about as long as the loreal. The limbs are short, the hinder applied forward, reaching halfway to the ear, and contained rather more than two and onehalf times in the body. The forelegs reach to the angle of the mouth and are longer than the head. The hind leg from knee is contained three and one-half times in head and body and is one and one-third times the head to ear, which again is contained four and

more than half the head (to 1 ey)
ear). Scales on sides arranged very obliquely, so as to render it impossible to count the encircling series. There are, however, about twentyeight rows, and about fifty-seven from head to tail.
The very young in this species (head and body, 37.5 mm.) is entirely black, the end of the tail becoming bluish; each plate on the side of the head above, each labial, upper and lower, and each mental plate with a conspicuous, rounded, bluish-white spot occupying all but the outer border. The effect is that of three rows of spots on the side of head and one on each side the chin. The middle lateral, or that on the upper labial, is continued backward as a large spot in front of the ear and another on its posterior edge running out behind into a point. There are traces of similar spots on the other cephalic plates, but much less distinct.
With advancing age the ground color becomes more olivaceous. paler beneath, each upper scale with a posterior margin of darker olive very well defined. These characters continue until the specimen is 75 mm. long, head and body (Cat. No. 3162), the spots on the chin only disappearing in the pale olivaceous green of the under parts. In Cat. No. 3162 the light line through the ear is continued faintly to the foreleg.

(Type, Cat. No. 3133.) The character of the cephalic plates appears to be essentially the same asin HL. quinquelineatus. The limbs are short; the hinder applied forward reach just three times to the tip of nose. The fore legs reach forward to the angle of the mouth. The hind leg from knee is about one and one-fifth the head to ear, which is contained five times in the head and body, the hind leg from knee, four and one third times. The neck is thick; the width of head three-fourths the length. The toes are short and thick, the fifth hinder decidedly less than the second, instead of longer, as in quinquelineatus. The toes are all short; the free portion of longest less than half the head to ear; the fifth less than second. Claws long, acute. There are twenty-six rows of scales around the body, and fifty-nine from occiput to tail.
Adult light yellowish or reddish blue, each scale with a dusky border, greenish white beneath. Head with a reddish tinge. Young black, the tip and sides of chin white; the labials spotted with white. Five very faint whitish lines; the upper lateral on adjacent edge of scales; the lower distinct only on side of neck. Faint spots on side of neck, cephalic plates above not spotted.
This species appears to be characterized among its immediate allies by the shortness of the hind toes, the fifth hind toe conspicuously shorter than the second. The description given above is from the type (Cat. No. 3133), which is an old individual. |

<<<Page: 672>>>

In a single very young specimen (Cat. No. 3113), head and body thirty-four millimeters long, I find what I consider the very young stage of this species. The distance from the centers of insertion of the fore to thatof the hind leg is one and one-half times that from the former to the snout. The hind leg applied forward twice, reaches a little more than halfway from arm to ear, and is contained two and two-thirds times in the head and body. The hind leg from knee is contained three and one-half times in the head and body. The fore leg from elbow is about equal to the head. The fifth hind toe is decidedly shorter than the second, the free portion of longest toe barely exceeding half the side of head. The head is broad, depressed. The color is an intense black, rather bluish beneath. There are five excessively faint, slender, whitish lines, a median dorsal, an upper lateral on the adjacent edges of the
Fig. 128. EUMECES OBSOLETUS BAIRD AND GIRARD. x €. Arizona. Cat. No. 14776, U.S.N.M.
third and fourth rows of scales. The lower lateral stripe is only appreciable on the neck. The extreme tip of the chin and sides of head beneath are whitish; the sides of the jaws are similar, but the sides of the labials are dusky. The posterior labials each have a large spot of white continued one anterior to and another behind the ear. The upper lateral stripe is continued along the side of the upper surface of the head, but the plates are not spotted.
This type of youngest coloration differs from that of guttulatus in the presence of fine light lines instead of a uniform black. The tip and sides of chin are entirely whitish, with an occasional dusky spot, instead of having each plate on the sides spotted sharply with white. The lower labials are more continuously whitish, and the upper are white, with the upper and lateral edges dusky, instead of having each labial

<<<Page: 673>>>

black with a central white spot. The posterior upper labials, indeed, are spotted, and there is a spot anterior to and one behind the ear, but no farther, neither are there the spots on the sides of the head above, but, instead, a faint continuous line.
I have before me no such series of specimens as of guttulatus, but one nearly as large as the type Cat. No. 3161 is distinctly marked with nearly black lines on a light olive ground, the upper labials distinctly spotted. There is a broad central stripe of the light olive, occupying the adjacent two-thirds of the two middle rows of scales. The upper edge of the second row, however, is olive, this color interdigitating with the black
on the outside of second row. In this respect it differs from the corre-_
sponding stripe of multivirgatus, in which the adjacent thirds of the first and second rows are involved in a common brown stripe. The adjacent edges of the second and third rows of scales are brown. This is followed by four light and three dark stripes, The most conspicuous markings, however, are the four dark stripes on 42 rows of scales, the central third of the space being plain olive, the two dark stripes on each side of this being nearly equal to each other and to their olive interspace. The scales have no dusky edging behind in the light stripes. This differs from multivirgatus again, in having the inner dark dorsal stripe as small and even smaller than the other, instead of larger.
In Cat. No. 4140, still larger than the type, the upper dorsal dark line has disappeared, leaving the lower quite distinct (separated from its fellow by four rows of scales). All the dorsal scales are margined behind with dusky.
All the other large specimens are entirely aaihoue lines. All the scales edged behind with dusky. Cat. No. 3161, however, has none of the scales with dusky edges behind where eee by the olive stripes.
In respect to the very largest specimens I have no means of deciding as to whether they really belong here or to guttulatus. I have decided the question chiefly on account of the short legs and hind toes. One of these from Matamoras, Cat. No. 3151, is the stoutest North American skink [ have ever seen. The head and body together measure 5 inches; the head is 27.5 mm. wide, or equal to the distance from nostril to ear, and the circumference of the perfectly cylindrical body where thickest is 100 mm.
The postnasal plate is sometimes absent. Such is the case in Cat. Nos. 4770, 5247, and 7842. In Cat. No. 9225 it is present on one side and absent on the other. These have 28 rows of scales, except Cat. No. 7842, which has 26,
Some exceptional forms of Ewmeces obsoletus have been sent me from Douglas County, Kansas, by Prof. F. H. Snow, of Lawrence. It is represented by three large adult individuals of very light colors. They differ remarkably in the scuta of the nose. In one the frontonasals and supranasals are in contact; in the other two they are separated by

<<<Page: 674>>>

the prefrenals. In the former there is one prefrenal on both sides, and a postnasal on one side. In No. 2 there is a postnasal on each side, and two prefrenals, one above the other, on one side only. In No. 3 the postnasal plate is elevated and is in contact above with the inter, frontonasal. On one side of the head it is divided by a horizontal fissure into two scuta, one above the other; the other side is undivided. The hinder leg measures one-third the distance from its base to the end of the muzzle. When extended along the side, the fore and hinder limbs just touch the extremities of each other’s claws. The second and fifth posterior toes are of equal length. Color pale ashen, with a bluish or greenish tinge. The external edges of the scales of the second row from the median line are brown, forming a longitudinal line on each side. In the same way the edges of the scales of the oblique lateral rows of scales are brown. These oblique brown lines are each six or seven scales long; anteriorly they become more longitudinal, two parallel lines running backwards from above the superior border of the ear. Superior labial plates brown-edged. Scales of posterior faces of limbs brown-edged.
Measurements.—Length to vent, 101 mm.; length to axilla, 38 mm.; length to meatus of ear, 20 mm.; length of hind leg, 32 mm.
No. 1 is colored like No. 3, omitting the dorsal lines; No. 2 is like No. 1, except that the lateral brown forms a loose band.
This species is characteristic of the Central region of the Nearctic Realm, not occurring in the Eastern, Austroriparian, or Pacific regions. It overruns a little into the borders of the Texan district and the Sonoran region. It ranges from the Platte River, Nebraska, on the north to the city of Chihuahua on the south. Mr. Marnock obtained this species near Helotes, Texas, where it is rare. I saw, but did not succeed in capturing, a lizard which I suppose to belong to this species, near the head waters of the Medina River. It was of dark tints, with light spots on the sides of the head, like the younger stages described by Professor Baird. It was concealed beneath the bark of a log, and, evading for a considerable time my attempts to take it, finally escaped.

The species belongs to the group of the EF. quinquelineatus, having a small postnasal in front of the base of the preloreal, and has but twentyfour rows of scales. The preloreal reaches the transverse interfrontonasal, which is smaller than each prefrontal. The limbs are not very short, being separated when applied to the side by a space less than the length of the forefoot. The coloration is as follows: The median dorsal pale band covers only the adjacent halves of the two median rows of

<<<Page: 676>>>

seales. A black band bordering itoccupies theremaining half of the row with the adjacent half of the next row. The remaining half of the next row is occupied by a pale band. A black line passes along the adjacent edge of the next row, whose middle is white. The external edge of the same row is involved in the superior edge of a wide band, which covers two rows and two half rows. Thus there are three dark bands on each side of the middle line, the inferior being the widest. Altogether they cover only five and a half rows of scales on each side. There are also no lateral light bands, as in many species, but the color of the abdomen extends to the lower dark band. Size rather small; length of head and body, 70 mm.
This species is allied to the EL. leptogrammus Baird. Most of the specimens of that species have twenty-six rows of scales, but one of them has twenty-four. In all the specimens of the latter the internasal is relatively larger, equaling, or nearly equaling, a prefrontal; in LH. epipleurotus it is about half as large as a prefrontal. The rostral plate in EF, epipleurotus is more elevated and acuminate above, its lateral labial border being about one-third the remainder, while in HF. leptogrammus it is more than half the length of the same. The anterior vental is smaller. The appressed limbs of the E. leptogrammus touch each other. It is possible, but very uncertain, that Boulenger is right in supposing EH. epipleurotus to be the adult of HE. leptogrammus.
I find but one specimen at present in the U.S. National Museum which is the original type.

Head short, rather broad, and with the lateral profile sloping considerably or quite convex. Cephalic plates much as in quinquelineatus, though the posterior postnasal sometimes entirely above the first, or divided in two. Seven upper labials. Limbs short and weak. Hind leg laid forward twice reaches midway between arm and ear, and from foot is about one-third the head and body; from knee is contained nearly four times. Fore leg from elbow is not equal to head from Snout to ear, which again is contained four and one-half times in head and body. Tail one and one-fourth times the head and body; cylindrical. In one specimen twenty-four rows of scales around the body; the median scarcely wider, and fifty-eight from head to tail; fifth hind toe shorter than second, free portion two-fifths the size of head to ear.

General color black, olivaceous above, with five very narrow and inconspicuous greenish-white dotted stripes; one dorsal (widest) and two lateral on each side. Tail and body beneath dark blue. Chin, throat, and upper labials white. The upper lateral stripe along the middle of the third row of scales from the median line; the lower on the middle of the third from this. Scarcely a trace of the bifurcation of the middle dorsal stripe; the hind legs uniform black.
The dorsal stripe is on the adjacent edges of two rows of scales. The others each on the middle of one series, thus differing from P, quinquelineatus, in which they are on adjacent edges. The lateral stripes are not continuous lines, but only a succession of dots, one central on each scale. The median stripe is similarly constituted by dots on the adjacent edges of two rows of scales, and is usually less distinct than the lateral. There is a faint indication that the remainder of the white dotted scales is black, leaving a dark olivaceous row on each side the back, each scale in which sometimes has a lighter center. There can scarcely be said to be a bifureation anteriorly of the median stripe. There are four entire rows of seales on the back between the upper lateral stripes.
Fig. 130. This species, remarkable for EUMECHS LEPIOGRAMMUS BATED. its diminutive size, has the genx §.

The hind legs are entirely black without a trace of the posterior white line. The cephalic bifurcation is wanting. The head is shorter, higher, and more arched. The

are much weaker and smaller, the hinder contained three times instead of two and one-half or less in the head and body. The scales are fewer in number. The hinder postnasal is very apt to be the first above to accommodate the brevity of the muzzle.
This is also a species of the Central region.

Body cylindrical; slender; legs far apart. Head short; convex above; two postnasals, usually of equal size, one exactly above the other. Very rarely one higher behind the other or divided into two. Seven upper labials. Ear very small, circular. Hind legs applied forward twice fall behind the fore leg, and three times reaches to the angle of the mouth, and is contained three and one-third times in head and body; from knee contained four and a half times.

Color pale olive, Wabekeiet green, or gray, lighter Cat. No, 4139, U.S.N.M. beneath and on the sides, with four or five brown stripes on each side. Every row of scales striped with brown and tho ground color. There is a narrow whitish stripe through the middle of the third row of scales from the dorsal line; the sides of the scales brown; above this line are two brown stripes, the inner wider; below it are three others, the middle broadest and along the edge of the head. The scales on the tail and legs are edged with brown; chin paler than the belly; the labials whitish, without brown, except on the upper edge.
As already stated, the back is much varied with lines of very light olive, greenish, or greenish ash, and brown. The key to the coloration is to be sought in a narrow line, lighter than the rest and sometimes almost white, which begins on the edge of the upper surface of the head and extends backward along the central third of the third row of scales from the median line of the back. The two sides of this row

being brown gives rise to two of the narrow brown lines. The adja. cent or inner half of the two median dorsal rows are plain and of the ground color; their exterior halves and the adjacent third of the next row are brown, producing the broad dorsal stripe. The second row of scales is thus left olivaceous along the central third, and brown externally, much as in the third row. The inner or upper half of the fourth row is light olive, interdigitating into the brown of the third row; its lower half, with the upper third of the next or fifth row, forms the second broad brown stripe. The central and lower third of this fifth row is light, the upper third brown. The next, or sixth, row when colored has a light line along the center, the sides brown, the lower brown, sometimes the upper wanting.
This species is very similar to that described as P. leptogrammus, but has a shorter head, much more elongated body, and feebler limbs; almost always two postorbitals, one above the other, not behind it. The theory of coloration is much the same, it being only necessary to have leptogrammus become light olive in the ground color, and the indications of dark stripes to become more distinct by the contrast. Indeed, but for the total difference in proportions, as substantiated by the comparison of a large number of specimens of each, I would have no hesitation in combining them.
A color variety which is unstriped was regarded by Baird as a distinct species under the name of Plestiodon inornatus. A specimen displays the following general characters:
Rody eylindrical, slender. Legs farapart. Head short, conical, convex above, as bigh as broad; two small postnasals, about equal, one exactly above the other. Hind leg applied forward twice reaches fourfifths of the way to the fore leg; three lengths reach to the ear; it is contained three and one-half times in the head and body; from the knee nearly five times. Fore leg from elbow as long as from snout to ear, which is contained five and one-half times in head and body. Tail one and one-half times head and body, constricted at base, then swelling. Fifth hind toe shorter than second; free portion of longest barely exceeding half the head to ears; about twenty-four rows of scales round the body; the lateral parallel to the dorsal; about fifty-eight scales from head to tail.
Color, very light olive, tinged beneath with bluish; without any dusky marks whatever; whiter beneath the head.

Hind legs applied forward thrice reach to ear; contained nearly four times in head and body; from knee, four and one-halftimes; head, fivetimes. Fifth hind toe shorter than second; free portion of longest two-thirds the side of the head.
Above reddish or greenish, olivaceous or ashy, with four principal nearly equidistant white stripes, two on each side, on the centers of rows of scales, and margined with dotted lines of dusky. A third intermediate line traceable anteriorly. Upper lateral stripes separated by two plain rows of scales; sides between the stripes with the scales edged behind with dusky. The lower lateral stripe begins on the labial and passes above the ears; beneath, white with a tinge of salmon color.
This species is very small and delicate, the limbs weak, although the toes are very long. The head is conical, pointed. The ears are very minute, not larger than the puncture of a fine pin.

The rows of seales traversed centrally by the light stripes have the edges dusky. The upper stripe passes through the center of the second row, the long lower one through that of sixth. The intermediate line, not always appreciable, and confined to the anterior half of body, traverses the center of the fourth row. The lateral scales between
these stripes are dusky behind; those on the back are plain. The lower |
edge of the posterior upper labials is spotted with dusky; the white stripe on the labials very distinct from the snout and suffused above with blackish. The anteorbitals and postorbitals are each white and black. There are no distinct lines on the legs. The young are probably entirely black between the lateral stripes. The tail has dusky lines on the sides, but no white ones, nor is there blue anywhere.
This species is more slender and elongated than any of its allies with a single nasal, and is easily distinguished by color and the separation of the upper lateral stripes by two rows of scales. The fusion of the third and fourth large supraorbital plates, counting from behind, is a striking peculiarity. The dorsal intervals of the stripes is seemingly greater than the lateral.

Body and neck cylindrical, stout; head small, conical, and depressed. Interfrontonasal plate small, rhomboidal, embraced between the supranasals and prefrontals, which are broadly in contact. A single postnasal (about equal to the nasal), equal in height and half the length of

inclosing a black one, the upper on each side along the center of one row of scales and separated by six dorsal rows. Four equal and equidistant black dorsal stripes between the white ones, each on two adjacent half rows of scales, the exterior margining the white lines, the inner obsolete in old specimens. Beneath greenish white, more yellowish under the chin, lower white line passing above the ear. Upper labials white. A faint whitish line below the thigh, margined above and below with dusky. The frontal is sometimes very small or even wanting, and always (with rare exceptions) cut off from contact with the postnasal. In one specimen it is applied against the frontal. In the most typical speci-

mens the frontal, the postfrontal, and internasals are all rhomboidal, the latter rather smaller and transversely; the rest about equal, their longer axis longitudinal.
In the smallest specimen of Cat. No. 3156 the hind legs reach forward half way to the center of insertion of fore leg, the third application falling a little short of the nose. In the other two, however, three applications of this length reaches only to the ear. The small specimen has longer limbs than the largest, in which the hind foot from heel is contained five times in head and body. The white lateral lines are very well defined and narrow, the upper beginning on the superciliary edge, the lower beneath the eye on the upper edge of the fifth labial and passing upwards so as to proceed backwards along the upper edge of the ear and not through it, as in most species. Posteriorly, it usually passes along the center of the second row below that traversed by the upper line, the black interval being then 1 and 3 scales wide. Frequently these intervening black scales are olivaceous at their bases, so

<<<Page: 683>>>

as to produce the effect of a succession of narrow light crescents, the concavity posterior. The lower white line is usually margined narrowly below by blackish.
It is probable that in the very young the adjacent edges of the two central and the third and fourth lateral upper rows of scales form whitish lines alternating with the dusky ones. They, however, fade out. — The two central dusky stripes are not pure black as is that margining the upper lateral stripe above, and soon fade, but there is generally a trace left along the adjacent edges of the first and second rows in each side. The scales below the lateral stripes have rather paler edges. The lateral stripes extend some distance on the tail.
A comparison is scarcely needed between this species and the BE. quinquelineatus, one having a postnasal, the other none, with other differences in the head and many in general proportions. The upper lateral stripe is on the middle of one row, not on adjacent edges of two; the lateral stripes are closer together; the lower passing above the ear instead of through it.
This is another species of the plains of the Central region, and it ranges farther north than any species of the genus, that is, to the northern part of Minnesota.
Cat. No. 11840 from Old Fort Cobb presents a remarkable exception to the normal character, in having the frontonasal extended laterally so as to reach the loreal on both sides. This specimen is otherwise normal. In Cat. No. 15685 the internasal is similarly extended to the loreal, but the contact on one side is very slight. The color is peculiar, being olivaceous, with a brown band on each side which covers one and two half rows of scales, and has a pale border above throughout as far forward as the supraorbital plates. It is pale bordered below from the auricular meatus to near the middle of the side.
A large adult (Cat. No. 11699) is uniform dark brown above, and yellowish brown below.
The two specimens, Cat. No. 5325, differ from the types in the relatively longer legs. They are, when extended on the side, only separated by a space equal to the length of the forefoot. In the typical form the space is equal to the length of the forearm and forefoot together.

Tail long and thick at the base. No postnasal plate; anterior loreal elevated, reaching the transverse interfrontonasal plate. Postloreal as high as or higher than long; two preoculars between fourth and fifth superior labials; one mental; twenty-six rows of scales; tail large, nearly as stout as the body at the base, subtetragonal; legs small, separated by the length of the anterior limb when appressed; the hind leg a little more than one-fourth the length of the head and body. Above, light brown; below, pale greenish; anteriorly, strawcolored; a light narrow band from the superciliary border continued along the body and tail, separated from that of the opposite side by six seales, and with a strong black border above. Below it, a deep brown or black band one and two half scales wide, which is bounded below by another light line; this is in turn bordered by a narrow brown line below, which does not extend like the other bands on the tail. The head and lips are pale brown, and the only head bands are posterior to the orbits.
Measurements.—Length of head and body, 78 mm.; to ear from muzzle, 13 mm.; of fore limb, 15 umm.; of hind limb, 19 mm.
This elegant species belongs to the same group as the LH. brevilineatus, and differs from the H. anthracinus and LH. tetragrammus in the same characters. It differs from the #. brevilineatus in the higher loreal plates, the much smaller limbs, and totally in the coloration. One specimen only is in my collection; it was procured near Dallas by Mr. Boll. In size, it is above the average in the genus. ;
1 find on comparison of this species with specimens of F. septentrionalis Baird from Neosho Falls, Kansas, in the National Museum, that the differences between the two species are not great, but that they are nevertheless sufficiently distinguished by the following characters:
BE. pachyurus. E. septentrionalis.
Postnasal secute reaching interfrontoPostnasal widely separated from inter-
nasal. frontonasal. No dark dorsal stripes. Two black dorsal stripes. Rows of scales, 26. Rows of scales, 28.
Unfortunately I have temporarily mislaid the only specimen of this very distinct species which I have seen, and can not therefore give a figure of it.

Cat. No. 15543, U.S.N.M. two upper on the central
line of the fourth row of
seales (separated by six plain rows), the lower on the middle of the
seventh row; the sides between the stripes dusky, beneath lighter olive,
becoming yellowish white on the chin and upper labials, which are without dusky margins
Entirely black, with an olivaceous tinge.
The species varies much in proportions, the younger having the legs longer and body shorter. Then the hind leg is contained from two and three-fourths to three and one-half in head and body; the head to ear from four and one-half to five and one-half times. The center of insertion of fore leg is from three-eighths to three-ninths the distance from snout to insertion of hind leg.
This species bears a close relationship to the EZ. anthracinus, from which it is chiefly to be distinguished, in addition to the points already stated, by the fact that the upper lateral light stripe is through the middle of the fourth row of scales instead of the third, and thus sepa rated by six rows of scales, not four, and has no dusky edging above. | The stripes are yellow, not greenish white. The sides and legs scarcely darker than the back in the young and of much the same color

in the adult, instead of being at first coal black and then olive brown. The under parts are always olive green instead of blue black or bluish in the young, changing to greenish in the older ones. The color of the back is rather a reddish than greenish olive in many specimens. The seales are much smaller, there being generally 28 round the body instead of 24. The lateral scales have generally a darker border in old specimens. Sometimes there is a dusky olive spot at the base of each dorsal scale. The upper labials are almost entirely whitish, like the chin. In the collection are ten specimens from Matamoras which agree precisely in every respect with the others, except that the body appears more cylindrical and rigid. The color, however, almost uniform lustrous black above. This color shaded, especially below and on the tail, with very dark olive. I can scarcely believe it to be a distinct species, however, and prefer to consider it as a black variety. The largest is fully equal in size to any of the striped specimens, the head and body ineasuring 92 mm. This skink is so far known only from Texas.

Supranasals, internasal, and prefrontal rhomboid; the former smaller and more transverse than the rest. One prefrenal equal to the supranasal, half as long as and higher than the pentagonal loral, extending upward to contact with the internasal. Upper labials, six or seven. One large transverse pentagonal mental plate in the end of the chin, behind the extreme tip, instead of the two of EF. quinquelineatus.

Fore leg from elbow equal to side of head. Fifth hind toe shorter than second; free portion of longest little more than half the side of head. Scales of body in twenty-four longitudinal series, quite parallel on the sides; forty-seven scales from head to tail.

each side; their interval and a border above and below grayish black. Upper lateral stripe generally on the middle, sometimes a little below, of the third row of scales from the back; the lower on the adjacent edges of the sixth and seventh. This passes anteriorly through the ear along the upper labials. The portion of the third row of scales on the back interior to the white stripe (which occasionally is on the edge of the third and fourth) is black, leaving four dorsal rows perfectly uniform dark olive green, without least trace of a median line. Under parts light greenish, paler beneath the head; the tail bluish black. Legs black above, the under parts without trace of stripe.
The five type specimens of this species from Carlisle vary very little in coloration, except in the portion of the upper lateral stripe, which is usually on the center of the third row of scales, but occasionally near its lower edge, where, however, it only involves the very extreme edge

of the next row. It is very seldom on the fourth row. The black upper border seldom involves the outer edge of the second row, though interdigitating with it. The two upper stripes are one and one-half times wider apart than either is from its fellow below. The labials are sometimes dusky below, where traversed by the lower lateral stripe; sometimes uniform white; always dusky above. The upper stripe runs along the edge of the head above to near the nostril.
Very young specimens are lustrous black on the sides and exterior surface of hind legs; the belly, greenish blue; the tail, bluish beneath. With age the sides become more gray, the under parts lighter greenish, but there is no great difference.
This species differs from EZ. quinquelineatus in the head plates and proportions, as also in the absence of the slightest trace of a median dorsal light stripe or any bands between the two upper lateral ones. E, skil-
tonianus is more like it in markings, but has two mental plates across —
the chin, ete., as in quinquelineatus. E. anthracinus also has the light
lines narrower, the two upper much farther apart and separated on the
back by four rows of plain olive scales instead of two.

<<<Page: 688>>>

The black upper border to the upper lateral stripe is sometimes a dotted line instead of being continuous.
In a single specimen (Cat. No. 3123) there is the faintest possible trace of a light dorsal line, with remains of a dusky lateral edging in the form of fine blackish dots. This marking, however, is very obscure.
The occurrence of six rows of olive-colored scales between the dorsal stripes will not necessarily determine a specimen to be EL. tetragrammus, this being more the result of the multiplication of dorsal scales. To ascertain the species reference must then be had to the amount of dusky color on the sides and above the upper stripe, or whether the latter is like the rest of the back, whether the mental plate is single or double, the postnasal with its hinder edge above the middle of the second labial or in line with its edge.
This species belongs to the Eastern region, being most abundant in the Allegheny district, from Pennsylvania southward. It also occurs in Texas.

This is a Hwmeces of the group of the HE. anthracinus. It has therefore four supraorbital plates and no postnasal. Its loreals are like those of that species and LZ. pachyurus, of a rather elevated form, the prenasal reaching the transverse interfrontonasal.

upper ones of opposite sides separated by a width of six scales. There is a faint trace in the typical specimen of a pale vertebral line with a dark border on each side, and there is a black border above the upper lateral line and another below the inferior lateral line. These lines extend to the orbit and ear respectively. The superior labials are green, black bordered; the other head plates brown with black borders.
The elevated form of the loreals and undivided mental plate ally this :
species to the #. anthracinus. The more numerous scales and labial plates, the wide interfrontonasal and different coloration distinguish it. From E. pachyurus its well-developed limbs separate it. In E. brevilineatus the loreal plates are differently formed and the coloration is totally different. The size is rather small. But one specimen of this species is known. Jt was taken near Mobile, Alabama, by Dr. Joseph Corson, U. S. A., well known by his important additions to Eocene vertebrate paleontology. It is preserved in my private collection.

The following are the skeletal characters of this family:
Premaxillary single. Epipterygoid present. Angular and surangular bones confiuent. Supratemporal in contact with parietal, closing the supratemporal foramen. Meckelian groove open.
Tongue covered with imbricate papille. Teeth few, conical, slightly hooked. Interorbital septum well developed; no bony postorbital arch; infraorbital fossa present, bounded by the palatine and transverse bones; palatines and pterygoids not meeting on the median line of the palate. Limbs absent; pectoral and pelvic arches reduced to a small, slender bone on each side. Abdominal ribs present.
Body vermiform, with osteodermal plates, as in the Scincide. Eyes concealed under the skin. No ear opening. No preanal pores.
The few members of this family, a degraded type of the Scincide, with which they are closely connected through the genus Acontias, are burrowers, and were at one time believed to be confined to tropical and south Africa, but a genus which I added from Mexico shows that the Scincoid lizards have undergone in the New World the same degenerative process as in the Old World.

<<<Page: 691>>>

In Feylinia there is a long squamosal articulated to the side of the
parietal, as in Rhinewra and Cephalopeltis; the premaxillary is single,
and the palatine lamin of the maxillary are dilated. The spleniomental groove is open. There are two slender clavicles united medially and giving insertion to the thoracic hemapophyses. These, according to Rathke, are present, but not in contaet in Acontias, and Peters and Stannius failed to find them in Typhloscincus. The pelvis I find to be represented by an oblique bone at the extremities of two pairs of ribs on each side of the vent.
Two of the three genera of this family display the following degradational characters of the arches and limbs.
Anelytropsis papillosus Cope, from Eastern Mexico. Not previously examined.
No seapular arch; pelvic arch rudimental; no external limbs.
Pelvic arch.—This is represented by two elements, a proximal and a distal. The former is directed downward and forward. Its proximal extremity is articulated with a single simple diapophysis, from which it extends a short distance posteriorly in a horizontal direction as far as the posterior extremity of the centrum of the same vertebra. From the inner side of its distal extremity there extends posteriorly a simple rod-like bone to a point in line with the anterior margin of the vent. Its length is about equal to that of the superior element. The superior element is ilium, but the inferior does‘not appear to be either pubis or ischium. Its position and direction are not inconsistent with its identification with the femur; but as it occurs in snakes, which have a rudimental femur, it can not be that bone.
Observations.—The inferior element in the pelvis in this genus is the same as that which I described as occurring in the African form of this family, Feylinia (Anelytrops Hallowell), but the latter differs in the absence of the rib-like ilium. It is interesting to notice the resemblance between these genera, which are so widely removed geographically. Feylinia, however, differs further from Anelytropsis in the presence of a pair of clavicles.
Feylinia currori Gray. Described by me.! From West Africa.
Scapular arch.—This consists of a pair of osseous clavicles which nearly meet on the median line. The anterior ribs to the number of Seven pairs meet on the median line by their cartilaginous hzemapophyses, which are directed forward at an acute angle, the angle of the anterior pair intervening between the clavicles.
Pelvic arch.—This consists of a single element lying on each side of the vent antero-posteriorly, perhaps homologous with the corresponding element in the Annulati. It is in contact with the distal extremities of three ribs, and is connected by ligament with a third anterior to them. These are the last ribs, and they are followed by a pair of sacral vertebree whose diapophyses are united distally.

<<<Page: 692>>>

Remarks.—This pelvic element is probably the iliopectineal element of Fiirbringer. The pelvis differs from that of Anelytropsis (antea) in the absence of iliac element.
ANE LD YLRO PSis (Gope:; Anelytropsis COPE, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., XXII, 1885, p. 380.—BOULENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., II, p. 430.
Rostral plate capping muzzle, the nostril at the junction of its posterior border with the suture separating the loreal and first labial. No frontonasal nor supraorbital plates. Three plates on top of head, which should probably be identified as anterior and posterior frontal and parietal. Eye scarcely visible through the single ocular plate. Seales equal, smooth. Vent not terminal. No limbs. No preanal pores.
This genus only differs from Feylinia Gray (= Anelytrops Hallowell) in the arrangement of the lateral plates of the muzzle. In that genus and Typhlosaurus, the only other genus of the family, the rostral plate is as in Acontias; that is, divided longitudinally on each side by a fissure which extends from the nostril posteriorly. Whether the internal characters differ remains to be ascertained.' I give the genus the name Anelytropsis in order to justify the family name Anelytropid. This will produce no confusion, as the name Anelytrops was given by Hallowell to the genus which had previously been named Feylinia, and aS a Synonym disappears from view.
The present form is essentially interesting as a representative of the family of the Anelytropidz, or the Typhlophthalm lizards with the eye entirely concealed, and with the tongue scaly. The importance of this discovery is considerable, as it shows that the scincoid lizards have undergone in the New World the same degenerative process as in the Old World, and in the same way. This is a new fact, even supposing that the Anniellidze of America are a degenerate form of the same family, which is not probable. Dr. Boulenger believes that that family is a degenerate type of the Anguid stem—a view in which I suspect he is correct. <Anelytropsis is a degree farther down in the seale than Anniella, in having the epidermis absolutely continuous over the eye, as in other members of the family of Anelytropide, and as in the Typhlopid family of snakes. As in other forms of this character, the life of this type is doubtless subterranean, which accounts for its having so long escaped observation.

ANELYTROPSIS PAPILLOSUS Cope.
Anelytropsis papillosus Cop, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1885, p. 380, pl. fig. 9.— BOULENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., II, 1885, p. 431. .
Form slender. Tail moderately long, with obtuse extremity. Seales scincoid, with rounded edges, everywhere equal, including the preanal region. Color brownish flesh color.
The head is distinguishable from the body by its slightly greater width, and is slightly contracted at the position of the orbits, and con. tinued as a distinct muzzle. The body is cylindrical, and the tail is a little longer than one-fourth the total length. ‘Twenty longitudinal series of scales. The area represented by the rostral plate of Acontias is invaded on each side by two labial plates, and a large loreal above them. Behind the second labial plate is a very small third, and above itis a large ocular plate which extends upward and forward to a line with the superior border of the loreal. The pale spot which represents the eye is situated in the lower posterior corner. The fourth and last labial is a little larger than the second, and has a narrowly rounded posterior extremity. Above itis a small postocular, which is in contact with the posterior frontal. On the summit of the head there are three scuta. The anterior, or anterior frontal, is the smallest. It forms a transverse band between the loreal and ocular of one side and those of the other. The succeeding plate, the postfrontal, is the largest. It is succeeded by the parietal, which is a transverse plate, concave in front and convex posteriorly, and which is separated from the postocular on each side by a single scale. Posterior to this scute, the scales of the body begin.
There is a large symphyseal plate which is a triangle with its apex posterior and truncate. It is bounded on each side by a very large inferior labial, which is also a triangle. This is followed on the labial margin by two very small labial plates. A small body scale succeeds the symphyseal, and this is connected with the small posterior labials by a narrow plate on each side. These are followed by the body scales. Six laterally imbricated scales bound the vent in front.
Measurements.—Total length, 170 mm.; length of tail, 45 mm.; of head, to line connecting rictus oris, 41 mm.
The rostral, loreal, and anterior two labial scuta are marked with minute papille, which, when removed, leave punctiform impressions. They are not very closely placed. Two specimens from near Jalapa. None in the U.S. National Museum.

Dr. Boulenger gives the following description of this family:
Tongue short, bifid posteriorly, pointed, undivided in front, covered with curved lamelle or plice. Teeth small, pointed, hooked, none on palate. Skull compact; no interorbital septum; no columella cranii; no arches; no infraorbital foramen; premaxillary double. Limbs absent, the hind pair represented in the male by a pair of flaps on the sides of the anal opening; no rudiments of the sternal apparatus. Body vermiform, covered with cycloid, imbricate scales. No osteodermal plates. Eyes concealed under the skin. No ear opening. No preanal pores.
A single genus, which appears to stand in the same relation to the Scincide as Anniella to the Anguidie.
Snout normally covered by three large shields,viz, the rostral, and a labial on each side, which, however, may fuse into asingleshield. Nostril pierced in the rostral, with a straight horizontal suture behind it. Limbs totally absent in the female, the hind pair represented in the male by two flap-like rudiments.
Dibamus Duméril and Bibron.
But two species of Dibamus are known, the D. noveguinee Duméril
and Bibron, from New Guinea and adjacent islands and the D. nicobaricus Steindachner from the Nicobar Islands.
Annielloidea GILL, Smithsonian Report, 1885, 1886, p. 800. Anguisauri Cops, Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 25.
Petrosal bone produced anterior to the anterior semicircular canal, articulating with the margin of the decurved parietal. Olfactory lobes underarched by frontal bones; no supratemporal. Occipital closely articulated with parietals. Cervical and caudal intercentra coossified with the centra. Palatine and pterygoid foramina present. Tongue papillose; no ceratohyals.
This superfamily is, as already indicated, allied to the Annulati, but is distinguished by the characters given in the analytical table of superfamilies on p. 200, as well as by various others of less significance.
There is but one family, which is characterized as follows:

the presphenoidal vacuity and consequently the interorbital septum, and the bones which constitute the brain case firmly united; a columella cranii, no supratemporal; postorbital arch ligamentous, pterygoids not in contact with sphenoid; a palatine foramen; premaxillary single; nasal and frontal divided; parietal single; preorbital and postorbital in contact, separating the frontal from the border of the orbit.
The viscera display the following characters in the genus Anniella: The left lung is much smaller than the right lung, and is proximally fused with it so that there is but a single lumen. Right lung much enlarged and covering the alimentary canal below (veutrad). Liver considerably posterior to heart, long and narrow, with a small left lobe and a long right lobe extending to the reproductive cells. Gall bladder inclosed by the liver and exposed inferiorly, that is, occupying a foramen, asin the Diploglossa. Alimentary canal distinguished into stomach, and small and large intestine, without distinct colon. Stomach without curvature; small intestine moderately plicated, with lacertiform mesentery. Reproductive cells anterior, symmetrical; kidneys symmetrical, posterior. There is a single gastrohepatic mesentery from the middle line of the liver, and no right hepatic or lateral hepatics. Hepatoventral simple; plates of epigastric very loosely attached together. No pulmonaries at middle of liver.
The fusion of the lungs is a peculiarity that I have not noticed elsewhere among the Sauria. The left lung is like a diverticulum of the right, and posterior to the point of divergence from the latter is bound to it by connective tissue to the extremity. This fusion is a step nearer to obliteration than occurs in any of the serpentiform genera of Teiidix, Scincide, or Anguidz, where, though of reduced size, it is distinct from the right except at its proximal extremity.
The affinities of the Anniellidw, as indicated by the osteology, are interesting. When I first, in 1864,! pointed out the cranial peculiarities of the genus Anniella, I created for it a distinct family, which I associated with the Acontiide and Anelytropside. Subsequently, in 1887, I proposed for it a still more independent position, making it the type of a special superfamily, which I called the Anguisauri; a course which had been already adopted by Gill a short time previously,? who proposed for it the superfamily of the Annielloidea. The further knowledge of its structure above recorded brings out more clearly its true position which I gave it in 1892.4. This is, I think, in the Annulati or Amphisbenia. The characters which indicate this reference are: (1) The continuity of the parietal with the petrosal and supraoccipital elements. (2) The absence of ceratohyal elements. (3) The hypo-

(4) The partially opeu chevron bones, which are also continuous with the centra. (5) The position of the lung ventral to the alimentary canal.
There is agreement in various subordinate features, as the single pre maxillary, double frontal, and single parietal; and the absence of supratemporal bone; also the fusion of the surangular and articular bones. There are some differences to be noted. Thus, in some of the Amphisbienia at least, there is apparently an orbitosphenoid bone, which is wanting in Anniella. The pterygoid is more closely adherent to the basis cranii in the Amphisbeenia, and there is no palatine foramen, which is present in Anniella. The splenial is of full size in Anniella and the Meckelian groove is open. In the Amphisbzenia the groove is closed and the splenial is much reduced. There is no epipterygoid in the typical Amphisbeenia.
The presence of scales, the papillose tongue, and the distinct tegumentary eye fissure, with the characters above cited, define the Anniellide as avery distinet family of the Amphisbeenia. The presence of all the pelvic elements allies it to the Chirotid# rather than to the Amphisbenide.
Since my examination of the osteology of this genus Dr. G. Baur has reexamined the subject! and has added somewhat to our knowledge of it. He discovered the epipterygoid and the jugal, and finds a rudimentary pubis and ischium ‘which are united proximally.” He states that ‘‘ the pubis has an obturator foramen,” but what this means is not explained. He alleges that my description is not correct, but he indicates no error except the omission of the elements mentioned. Some sutural lines were omitted from my figure, which are now inserted.
But one genus of the Anniellide is known, which has the following characters:
Body vermiform; no limbs. Eyes represented by a fissure; ears concealed. No preanal pores. Scales soft, cycloid-hexagonal, imbricate; nostril in a single plate. Anniella Gray.
There are some characters of the skeleton of the genus Anniella in which it differs from the known forms of Euchirotide and Amphisbenide, whose value is uncertain. These are: (1) The internal gomphosis of the supraoccipital bone into the parietal; it is external in other Annulati. (2) The angular bone is chiefly exposed on the external side of the mandibular ramus. (3) There is no hypohyal process of the basihyal.

ANNIELLA Gray.
Anniella GRAY, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (2), X, 1852, p. 440.—Cops, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1864, p. 230.—BocourT, Miss. Sci. Mex., Rept., 1881, p. 460.— BoOULENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., 2d ed., I, 1885, p. 299.
Body cylindrical, elongated, without limbs. No trace of lateral groove —
nor of external ear. Head very short; depressed; cleft of mouth rather short. A broad frontonasal plate in extensive contact with a fused frontal and frontoparietals. A small interparietal in a notch of the latter. Nasal in the center of a single plate which comes to the edge of jaw. Eye distinct, but closed by the oppressed inferior eyelid.
The more detailed osteological characters are as follows. They are derived from specimens from San Diego, California, collected and presented to me by my friend, Mr. James 8S. Lippincott.
The premaxillary has an elongate spine, and the palatal suture presents backward two concavities separated by a median projection. The nasals are distinct and rather short and wide. The frontals are distinct and rather wide. The parietal is very large every way, is single, and has no pineal foramen. The supraoccipital forms a close suture with it, sending forward a median process for internal gomphosis, and an angle on each side of it. It is coossified with the exoccipital and is expanded to accommodate the large circle of the superior semicircular canal. The facial plate of the maxillary is large. The prefrontal is above the eye and is cut off from the parietal by an entrant angle of the frontal only. The lachrymal is small and is below and separated from the prefrontal. Jugals narrow, lying on the superior aspect of the maxillary, terminating freely. Postfrontal crescentic, bounded by both frontal and parietal. Postorbital a caducous scale lying in contact with the posterior limb of the postfrontal. A supraorbital bone external to the prefrontal. Petrosal with its superior border in close contact with the decurved lateral borders of the parietal, as in a snake. The latter do not, however, descend to the presphenoid, but leave a wide fissure below it which deeply notches the anterior border of the petrosal. Supraforaminal part of pretrosal produced to an acute angle, terminating at the parietal border much in advance of the anterior semicircular canal. Body of petrosal perforated by a large foramen just in front of the superior part of the quadrate. No parietoquadrate arch, but a posteroexternal angle of the parietal extending near to the proximal extremity of the quadrate. No distinet supratemporal or paroccipital.! Stapes with large disk
and short, stout columella, with thickened tympanic extremity. Max-—
illopalatines continuous anteriorly, slightly divergent posteriorly; excavated by a deep groove posteriorly, which terminates in a fossa medially. The external borders of the posterior apices are turned out-
! Baur states that the paroccipital is present, but I have not been able to find it (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 1894, p. 349).

<<<Page: 698>>>

ward, so as to inclose partially the posterior nares below. The palatines are short, the groove separating the maxillary from the vomerine processes extending to the suture with the pterygoid, so that the maxillary process only appears as the inferior face of the bone. Pterygoids elongated anteriorly, reaching to beyond the middle of the palatine foramen. They extend directly back to the quadrates, being well separated on the middle line, and abruptly notched on the inner side to receive the short, angular basipterygoids. They are separated from the sphenoids by a fissure, and are grooved on the inner side posterior to the basipterygoid. Ectopterygoids present, rather slender, inclosing rather large palatine foramina. Epipterygoid small. Narial fissure overhung by the free edge of the maxillary and palatine bones. Sphenoid and basioccipital and exoccipital coossified. Occipital condyle convex and perfectly simple.
The mandible has anopen Meckelian groove, and the surangular and articular bones are coossified, while the angular and splenial bones are distinct. The latter extends well anteriorly. The coronoid extends a little forward on the exterior face of the ramus and in both directions on the inner face.
The hyoid apparatus is the most simple among lizards. It consists of a continuous cartilaginous glossobasihyal rod, which is bifurcated posteriorly, and a simple osseous first branchihyal attached to each of the branches. Other elements wanting.
Ten cervical vertebre with compressed inferior processes of the centra, or hypapophyses. They are coossified with the centra and are not intercentral in position, hence it is not evident that they are intercentra. No zygosphen. In the Anniella pulchra there are seventythree rib-bearing vertebr and two cervicals without ribs. The sacral and proximal caudal vertebre have diapophyses, those of the former little different from those of the latter. The fifth vertebra with a diapophysis supports a pair of parallel plates coossified with its inferior face like the chevron or double hypapophysis of a snake. In the succeeding vertebr similar plates form the basis of a chevron, whose Symphysis is turned rather abruptly posteriorly. The position of these chevrons is central and not intercentral. Caudal vertebrie not segmented.
Scapular arch wanting; pelvic arch mediventral; no limbs. The ilium is represented by a small and short rod like bone, which is attached to the extremity of the diapophysis of asingle vertebra. The proximal extremity is directed backward for a short distance posterior to the point of suspension, as in Anelytropsis. According to Baur, there is a rudimentary ischium and pubis, “which are united proximally.” No trace of posterior limb. Teeth simple, acutely conic.
The hemipenis is not bifurcate. It is surrounded by transverse lamin or flounces, which are crimped so as to be slightly pocketed. The organ resembles that of Gerrhonotus.

<<<Page: 699>>>

Three supposed species have been described, but I believe that two of them are referable to a single, rather variable form.
The range of the genus is confined, with present knowledge, to the southern part of the Pacific district.

Fig. 138. ANNIELLA PULCHRA GRAY. x3.
Cat. No. 16022, U.S.N.M.
Body depressed cylindric;.tail obtuse, about one-half as long as body, but varying somewhat in length. Scales smooth, everywhere equal, in generally thirty rows, but sometimes in twenty-eight and even twentysix. Head but little wider than body posteriorly, contracting radially to an obtuse, moderately depressed muzzle, which projects beyond the lower jaw. Preanal scales generally larger than those which precede them, but not much.
Rostral plate bounded posteriorly chiefly by the nasals, but also at the apex by the internasoloreal line, which have a short common suture on the middle line. Posterior to these there is a frontonasal, which is wider than long. Posterior to this is a large plate, probably composed — of the fused frontal and frontoparietals. This is notched on the posterior border for a small interparietal. Posterior to these plates is a Series of five smaller ones, of which two laterals on each side may be regarded as parietals, and the median an occipital. Posterior to these a few scales are larger than those of the body generally.
There are six superior labials, of which the first is beneath the nasal and part of the rostral, and is very narrow. The second is the largest and is longer than high, and is bounded above by the loreointernasal and the first and second preoculars. The third, fourth, and fifth labials are higher than long, and the third and fourth reach the eye, unless cut off entirely (which it is always in great part) by the inferior preocular. Nasal triangular with the apex posterior, deeper than long. Nostril rela

tively small. Superior preocular long; inferior preocular quite small. Supraoculars two, the anterior larger than the superior preocular, and joining the posterior border of the frontonasal by a suture nearly equal to that with the frontal, and separated from the opposite supraocular by a space greater than its own width, but not twice as great. Three small superciliaries; two squamiform postoculars.
Six inferior labials, which are subequal except the last two, which gradually diminish. A large symphyseal, which is as broad as long. It has two subequal facets on each side for the first labial and the first infralabial, the latter large, and meeting on the middle line. The remaining infralabials of the first series are three in number and are quite narrow. There is a second series of infralabials posterior to the first, consisting of three scales on each side. Those of the first pair are large, and are in contact on the middle line; the second is smaller and subtriangular, and the third is smallest and narrowest in form. The regular squamation begins posterior to these.
The closed inferior eyelid is covered with three scales, of which the median is the largest.
Preanal plates five, the median wedge-shaped, with the apex posterior.
There are two color varieties as follows:
Var. A, nigra: Upper half of body uniform dark purplish brown; beneath, yellowish white; scales slightly dotted with brown along their lateral edges, especially under the tail. Chin, throat, and across anal slit dusky (A. nigra lischer).
Var. B, pulchra: Lighter with three dark lines; a dorsal and lateral. Sometimes with fainter lines on the adjacent edges of all the rows of scales; the ground color above yellowish gray or ash.
Specimens from Monterey are uniform purplish brown above, yellowish white below. Cat. No. 3188, from San Francisco, is rather lighter, with three narrow dark lines, one on the middle of the back on the adjacent edges of the two central rows of scales; the other on the adjacent edges of the fifth and sixth rows from the middle. Below this are some less distinct lines on the sides. Smaller specimens from San Diego have, in addition to these, fainter lines along the adjacent edges of every row of scales.
The characters of this species are tolerably constant. In six specimens out of seventeen, I find the small preocular absent. The length of the tail in seven specimens varies from four-elevenths to one-third the total length.
Dr. J. G. Fischer! has described a specimen of Var. A as a distinct species under the name of A. nigra. Besides the color characters, he finds it to differ in the shorter tail, and in the longer preanal Seales. The tail in his specimen of A. nigra is one-third the length, while in his single pec OF AL ie! it is two-fifths of the same.
1 Abhandl. Nee v er. a: Sana IX, 1885 nate copy, p. 9).

<<<Page: 701>>>

I have seen no example with the tail as long as the latter specimen, but a proportion of four-elevenths is met with alike in dark colored and pale individuals. The difference is not important. The length of the anal seales varies within the limits mentioned by Dr. Fischer. In some specimens these scales are a little longer than those in front of them, and in one pale example (Cat. No. 12555) they are twice as long.
Dr. Boulenger describes! a specimen said to come from El Paso, — Texas, as the type of a distinct species which he calls A. terana. The characters which he gives are mainly those of the A. pulchra, but there are a few differences. Thus the nasal plate has a suture extending posteriorly from the nostril to the border, and the interparietal and occipital plates are divided by a longitudinal suture. The head is said to be less depressed and the snout more rounded than in the A. pulehra, The presence of the sutures above mentioned may be anomalous, but if the form of the head be essentially different from that of the A. pulchra they might be constant. I have never observed them in any specimen of the A. pulchra. Without figures it is difficult to estimate the significance to be ascribed to the form of the muzzle. The locality will require verification, as it is out of the range of most of the Californian forms. We will await further information before forming an opinion as to the value of this form.
This pretty species considerably resembles the “blind worm” of Europe in form and appearance, but has no affinity with it, representing a different saurian phylum. Of its habits nothing is known. Its habitat is restricted to the Pacific district from San Francisco southward, including San Diego.

ANNIELLA TEXANA Boulenger. Anniella texana BOULENGER, Annals and Magaz. Nat. Hist., Lond., XX, 1887, p. 50. The following description is copied from Boulenger:
Head less depressed, snout more rounded . an in 4. pulchra. Nasal shield semidivided, a horizontal suture extending from the nostril to the second labial; frontal twice as broad as long; anterior supraocular nearly as broad as the distance which separates it from its fellow; interparietal and occipital divided (anomalously?) by a longitudinal suture; six upper labials—first very small, below the nasal, second largest and in contact with the prefrontal and a loreal, third and fourth entering the eye; a narrow shield separates the third labial from the loreal; five lower labials. Twenty-eight scales round the middle of the body. Noenlarged preanal scales, Tail ending obtusely, three-eighths of the totallength. Dark gray above with three fine black longitudinal lines; sides and lower surfaces whitish.
From snout to vent, 145 mm.; tail, 85 mm.
A single specimen from El] Paso, Texas.

Amphisbania GRAY, Cat. Tort. Croc. and Amphisbenians Brit. Mus., 1844, p. 68.
Opheosauri Corr, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1864, p. 226; Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 25.
Parietal bones laterally decurved, and continuously united with petrosal by suture, and fused on the middle line, frontals inclosing olfactory lobes of the brain below. No cranial arches, vertebrie procelous; the cervicals with coossified hypapophyses on the middles of the centra. Chevrons coossified with the middle of the centra, the anterior without symphysis.
The visceral characters are as follows:
One lung, apparently the left, which lies ventrad of the alimentary eanal. Liver situated much posterior to the heart, very elongate, distally bilobate, the right lobe much longer than the left. Gall bladder situated in the notch between the lobes of the liver. Stomach not turned to the left; small intestine elongate, terminating in a large intestine which is imperfectly distinguished into colon and rectum. Kidneys posterior, symmetrical; a urinary bladder. Corpora adiposa present, free. Ventral mesentery extending from heart to distal extremity of liver, hence elongate; dorsal mesentery following the plications of the intestine and not binding them into a simple mesenteric pouch, as is seen in the Serpentes.
Subordinate modifications are observable in different types. Thus, in Amphisbena alba and A. fuliginosa there is a short cecum, and the corpus adiposum is subdivided. In Rhineuwra floridana there is no excum, and each corpus adiposum is undivided.
This superfamily embraces the most snake-like of the Sauria. This affinity is seen in most parts of their osseous structure, in the inclosure of the brain case by the frontal and parietal bones in connection with the petrosal, the absence of supratemporal, the numerous coossified

<<<Page: 703>>>

hypapophyses of the cervical vertebr, and the open central chevrons of the caudals. The peculiar pelvic bone differs entirely from that which is seen in genera of Anguide, which are equally without posterior limbs, and is only approached by that of the Anelytropide among other lizards. It more nearly resembles a corresponding element in the peropodous snakes, when arudimental ilium and pes are also present, and the Typhlopidz (Fiirbringer), where no rudiment of leg exists. Its nearest point of affinity to the other Sauria is seen in the Anelytropide.
The contents of the superfamily includes four families, which fall into two groups, as follows:
I. Seales present; an eye-fissure; tongue papillose; teeth pleurodont; no limbs.
II. No distinct scales nor eye fissure; tongue scaly: Teeth pleurodont; anterior limbs...--......----.---.-.--..----. EUCHIROTIDE. Teeth pleurodont; mo limbs: =. <2 seee ee eee eae eee AMPHISBENIDE. Teethiacrodont;imo lambs: (ee aes =-s =e ate aaa See ss TROGONOPHIDS#.
The above families agree in several characters not included in the above diagnosis of the superfamily. Thus, all have a single premaxillary, but double nasals and frontals. The premaxillary is in contact with the vomer. The articular and surangular bones are united, while the angular is distinct. The coronoid bone has little horizontal extent on the external face of the ramus.
All the forms are vermiform and of subterranean habits.
Boulenger thinks that the Amphisbenide are allied to the Teiide through such forms as Ophiognomon and Microdactylus. I have already pointed out the characters of this type under the Teiid# in descrfbing the anatomy of the genus Propus. There is nothing especially Amphisbenian other than what may be observed in serpentiform lizards of several families, although the external appearance of these Teiid forms is in favor of such a view. Anniella, the least typical of the Annulati, is nearer to the Diploglossa in the character of the tongue, and it is not unlikely that it is to this group after the Annulati that it is most nearly allied, as remarked by Boulenger in the Catalogue of Lizards of the

genus are as follows: .
Seapular and pelvie arch present; fore limbs, but no hind limbs.
Scapular arch.—For the first time in the history of scapular reducetion we find the clavicle absent. No interclavicle nor precoracoid. Supraclavicle osseous. Clavicle and coracoid osseous, coossified; no coracoid cartilage. Sternum without costals, osseous, pentagonal, and with a long xiphoid process. Ulna and radius well distinguished.
Pelvic arch—An elongate element on each side, directed downward and a little forward, principally ilium, but with a short free distal extremity, which represents one or both of the inferior elements. A short curved cartilage represents the femur. The ilium is connected by a cartilage with the extremity of a single diapophysis, and a short free segment corresponding to this cartilage articulates with the vertebra which follows.
The scapular arch of Bipes canaliculatus Lacénéede has been described and figured by Miiller,! and by Duméril and Bibron,? both with omission of pelvic arch. The description and figure which I gave® as referring to that species, was really taken from the Huchirotes biporus, of the distinctness of which I was not at that time aware. Miiller says of the former species ‘‘that the clavicle and scapula are fused into a single piece.” This is probably an error, as there is apparently no clavicle, as may be seen by comparing the figures given in the present paper. Neither Miiller nor Duméril and Bibron detected the rudimental pelvic arch. Before I was aware of the difference between

<<<Page: 705>>>

Bipes and Euchirotes I thought this statement might have been due to badly preserved specimens, but it is quite possible that the two genera may differ in this respect.
In the Luchirotes biporus the liver is situated far caudal to the heart. Both extremities are bilobate, the caudal extremity unequally, as the — right lobe is much produced. It is separated from the left by a deep fissure, and the gall bladder is exposed on the left side, and it is not inclosed as in Anguide. The trachea passes above the heart to a point a short distance beyond it, where, without dividing, it enters a single biauriculate lung. The lung lies entirely ventrad of the gut, and extends along the left side of the liver part of its length. The heart is halfway between the end of the muzzle and the caudal end of the liver.
The intestine presents two expansions proximad to the large intestine. The moderate constriction divides the latter into colon and section, and the former has a proximal cecum. The corpora adiposa are large. The transverse section of the liver is crescentic. It is supported by a gastrohepatic mesentery, and a sheet on the right, which, as it arises from the hepatic border, may be a hepatolateral, but which is probably homologous with the right hepatic of other Annulati. <A left gastropulmonary sheet. Hepatoventral single.

pair of frontals. There are also two small plates between the third labial and the suboculars. The anusis preceded by a transverse series of six longitudinal plates. There is a single preanal pore in a large plate in front of the external preanal plate of each side.
Measurements.—Total length, 199 mm.; limb, 8 mm.; tail, 18 mm.; head, 7 mm.
Zostral plate triangular, the apex touching the internasal. The latter is twice as wide as long, and the frontals are wider than long. The nasa] is subtriangular, with an obtuse apex directed posteriorly. The nostril is anterior to the center. The first superior labial is as long as the two others together. The symphyseal is large and is succeeded by four inferior labials; the first largest, the second intermediate, and the third and fourth subquadrate much smaller. <A large postmental longer than wide, which is bounded in front on each side by the first labial and for the greater part by a large infralabial, which separates it from the second labial. A band of fourteen scales between the angles of the mouth below and eighteen above.
The dorsal and abdominal scales are separated by a longitudinal groove which extends to the anus. The abdominal scales are about twice as long as the dorsals, one row answering to two of the latter, with an occasional opposition of the extremities of single rows as an exception. There are twenty-four rectangular divisions of each abdominal cross band, the terminal ones small and subtrangular. In a dorsal cross band there are twenty-nine transverse divisions. On the thoracic region the bands are interrupted on the middle line, alternating with each other and forming chevrons directed forward. The last gular band is short and convex posteriorly. The number of the bands is as follows: Gular, 7; thoracic, 4; abdominal, 138; caudal, 20. A few of of the caudal may be alternate on the middle line. The preanal plates are unequal, the median pair being much the largest. The next external are nearly as long and are very narrow; the third or external pair one-half the size of the second. In front of it is a larger scale leaving the pore in its posterior region, and external to the latter are two small scales.
The fore limbs are annulate, with scales like those of the belly, in six bands, from shoulder to digits. Digits I, Il, and III equal and two-fifths the length of the arm; IV shorter, and V shortest.
Measurements (Cat. No. 21325).—Total length, 202 mm.; total length of head to angle of mouth, 5 mm.; total length of tail, 20 mm.; total length of fore limb, 7.5 mm.

Dr. Boulenger gives the following description of this family:
Tongue moderately elongate, arrowheaded, covered with imbricate, scale-like papillx, ending in two long, narrow, smooth points. Teeth large, few, anchylosed to the inner edge of the jaws; premaxillary teeth usually in odd namber; no pterygoid teeth. Skull thick, strongly ossified, without interorbital septum, or columella cranii, or postorbital, or supratemporal arches; premaxillary single; nasals two; frontals two; parietal single, very large; an orbitosphenoid bone; quadratum very oblique or nearly horizontal, owing to the shortness of the postcoronoid part of the mandible; occipital condyle frequently divided. Vertebre very numerous, depressed, all except the foremost without spinous processes. Pectoral arch imperfectly developed in Chirotes, reduced to minute rudiments in the other (limbless) forms; pelvic arch reduced to minute rudiments. Worm-like, adapted to subterranean life; eyes concealed under the skin; mouth small, frequently inferior; no ear. Head covered with symmetrical plates; skin divided into soft, squarish segments, forming regular annuli. Tail short.
The shape of the skull varies considerably, according to the genera; in this respect Blanus appears to be least specialized, although the occipital condyle is divided, while it remains single (kidney shaped when seen posteriorly) in the otherwise more specialized Acrodonta. The mandible especially undergoes the greatest modifications, as may be seen from Gervais and Peters’s accounts of Blanus, Amphisbena, Lepidosternum, and Monopeltis. The angular bone is chiefly developed on the internal side of the ramus, and the splenial is very small. The coronoid is large and subtriangular, and is overlapped from behind by the surangular on the external face of theramus. Meckel’s groove is closed. The columella auris is robust. The paroccipital is present as a scale just above the quadrate.
All the members of this family are burrowers, and many live in ants’ nests. They bore narrow galleries in the earth, in which they are able to progress backward as well as forward. On the ground they progress on a straight line, by slight vertical undulations, not by lateral movements, as in other limbless reptiles; the tail of many species seems to be more or less prehensile. The food of these lizards consists of small insects and worms. Little has been published on their habits, and all that is known of their mode of parturition is that Anops kingii is oviparous, and deposits its ova in ants’ nests.
As many as sixty-one species are enumerated by Boulenger in the Catalogue of the British Museum; thirty-eight are American, out of which only one, Rhineura floridana, occurs north of the Tropic of Cancer, and four (Amphisbena and Diphalus) in the West Indies. The

Anatomy.—The characters of the regions of the arches and limbs have the following characters in Amphisbana occidentalis Cope:
No scapular arch nor limbs; a rudimental pelvie arch.
Pelvic arch.—This consists, in this species, of a slender bone in the abdominal wall, a little in front of the vent on each side, which is directed forward and inward, but without meefing its mate on the middle line. It has no articular connection with any other element. In Amphisbena alba this element is similar, but is relatively shorter and more as figured by Fiirbringer in the A. fuliginosa. This species has also, according to Fiirbringer, a very rudimental scapula.
As the left lung only is present in this family, there is but one gastropulmonary mesentery. The liver has a crescentic cross section, and it is supported by two gastrohepatic mesenteries (Amphisbena alba and A. fuliginosa), or by only one, and a right hepatic, or hepatolateral, as it may be (Rhineura floridana). There is but one hepatoventral.
The only species of which I have obtained a satisfactory hemipenis is the African Monopeltis galeatus Hallowell. The organ is bifureate; each branch is marked with fine, close, transverse folds, while the region proximad of these has coarser folds directed transversely and obliquely.
Origin.—No information as to the origin of the Amphisbzenidie or ot the Annulati was accessible until Dr. Baur in 1893! announced the discovery of two species in the Oligocene beds of South Dakota, where
' American Naturalist, 1893, p. 998.

<<<Page: 709>>>

skulls were found by Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of the Princeton exploring expedition. These crania represent two genera, Rhineura Cope, still existing, and Hypsorhina Baur, extinct, and both are more nearly allied to Lepidosternum than to Amphisbena. The species are termed R. hatcherii and H, antiqua.
This interesting discovery explains the existence of Rhineura in Florida, and relieves us of the necessity of supposing an immigration of Lepidosternoid reptiles from the South American continent, a hypothesis which is the more difficult to sustain, since there are no Amphisbenid in Mexico or the West Indies.
RHINEURA Cope.
Rhineura Cork, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1861, p. 75.—BOULENGER, Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II, 1885, p. 459.
Body vermiform, without legs, no ears, and the eyes invisible. Body encircled by a succession of continuous whorls, divided into square plates. Pectoral plates rather larger than elsewhere. Teeth conical, distant, pleurodont, none on the palatine. . Tongue fleshy, narrow, ovate, emarginate behind and slightly bifiid anteriorly; attached except at the tip. Tail flat, with tubercles in transverse series. Nostril pierced in a distinct nasal plate.
Osteology.—A specimen of the R. floridana Baird from Volusia, Florida, furnishes the characters of the skeleton.
The alveolar border of the premaxillary is very short, and supports only one, a median tooth. The spine is divided into two portions, that below the projecting angle of the muzzle and that above it. The former is contracted a little by a process of the maxillary which enters from the alveolar portion, separating it from the nostril, which is inferior in position. It then expands a little, to form on the upper side of the muzzle a terminal expansion twice as wide as long. The nasals are distinct, and extend to the border of the muzzle, overroofing the nostrils. Frontals wide, distinct, deeply emarginate posteriorly for the parietal. Prefrontal rather large, triangular, sending its apex posteriorly over the orbit and reaching the parietal. Its free border and a narrow band of the parietal form a crista temporatis, which do not unite on the middle line into a crista sagittalis. Parietal single, without pineal foramen, continuous laterally with the petrosal and alisphenoid, and posteriorly with the supraoccipital, from which it receives on the middle line a gomphosis. Supraoccipital bounding foramen magnum, of which tt forms a rather narrow border. A small triangular bone at the extremity of the maxillary may be a jugal or a lachrymal. The alisphenoid and petrosal form the inferior part of the side walls of the brain case, and are separated from the pterygoids and presphenoid below them by a narrow fissure which is widest below the petrosal. The latter sends an angle upward and backward between the parietal and exoccipital. The exoccipital sends a prolongation (paroecipital?) downward and for

<<<Page: 710>>>

ward, which gives articulation to the quadrate, bounding the fenestra ovalis above. The latter is large and is closed by the large disk of the stapes. The quadrate has no posterior proximal process, and is oblique proximally, but is more nearly vertical distally. In its posterior angle rests the club-shaped head of the robust columella auris.
The vomer presents atits anterior extremity a process which separates a transverse process from each maxillary, and enters a notch in the posterior border of the premaxillary. The vomers are plane in front, but become convex and separated by a fissure posteriorly, ending each in an acuminate apex lying on the presphenoid. The palatine is narrow and lies along the inner side of the ectopterygoid, consisting chiefly of its maxillary process; it is doubtful whether it possesses a vomerine process. Posteriorly it lies scale-like on the pterygoid, reaching nearly to the line of the quadrate. The narial fissure is nearly closed anteriorly, except a foramen-like portion at the anterior extremity. The presphenoid, sphenoid, and basioccipital are coossified. To these the pterygoid is closely appressed by the one side, while on the outer side the latter carries the narrow splint-like ectopterygoid as far as the maxillary. No palatine foramen. Occipital condyle simple, transverse, medially concave.
The mandible displays no Meckelian groove, and the splenial is small. The small angular is only visible on the internal side of theramus. Surangular and articularconfluent. Coronoid large, triangular, not concave below, and overlaid at base externally by anterior extremity of surangular; anteriorly not extended over dentary. Angle short, longer than wide, a little inflected, simple; its plane an angle of 45 degrees to that of the ramus.
The hyoid apparatus is very simple. It consists of a glossobasihyal cartilage which is deeply bifureate posteriorly. At the posterior extremity each posterior limb sends a process forward, which is about half as long as the anterior elements, the hypohyal. No ceratohyal nor second ceratobranchial. A rather short and simple osseous first ceratobranchial on each side.
The vertebral column consists of many cervico-dorsals and a relatively small number of caudals. The second vertebra has a strong keel-like hypapophysis, which is also strong on the third, but which diminishes from that point so that on the sixth it is no longer perceptible. The first rib is short and is attached to the third vertebra. Diapophyses and neural spines very short. The ribs do not display a vertical process at the head asin Lepidosternum octostegum. Diapophyses very short and simple on caudal vertebre. Caudal hypapophyses beginning on the anterior fourth of the caudal series, the halves at first widely separated. They soon converge downward, and finally touch, but are never coossified to form a chevron. Position on the middle of the length of the centrum. Rib-bearing vertebrie without trace of zygosphen.
Scapular arch absent. Pelvic arch represented by a single curved

<<<Page: 711>>>

rod on each side of and anterior to the vent, which is connected with the extremities of two ribs by ligament only. This is the ileopectineal bone of Fiirbringer. No trace of posterior limb.
Teeth simple, conic; situated on premaxillary, maxillary, and dentary bones only. Premaxillary with but one, a median tooth.
The genus Lepidosternum, as typified by the L. octostegum, differs from Rhineura in that the nasal bones are excluded from the narial borders by the maxillary, and from contact with each other by the prolonged spine of the premaxillary. In both of these points Rhineura agrees with Amphisbena. In Lepidosternum also there is a Meckelian groove, and the angie is turned vertically downward. In Amphisbena (fuliginosa) there is a groove and no angle.

Collection of E. D. Cope.
Body as thick as a large goose quill or larger. A large pentagonal plate on top of the head, encircled by nine others; the rostrum ending in a broad horizontal crescent overhanging the mouth. Noears. Tail one eighteenth the body; much depressed; its upper surface with the whorls covered by large tubercles set in smaller ones instead of by square flat plates. 3
Color yellowish white; in spirits; rose colored in life.
Body resembling somewhat a large Ascaris, white worm, in its uniform yellowish white color, absence of limbs, ears, and eyes, and succession of rings encircling it from head to tail. The head is contained about thirty-three times in the head and body and twice in the tail. It is ovoidal above, much depressed, the rostrum broad and projecting considerably beyond the lower jaw both terminally and laterally. A broad crescentic plate forms the tip of the rostrum. This may possibly be the frontal plate. Beneath this plate is a rostral which connects it with

<<<Page: 712>>>

the opening of the mouth, and on each side of this are three labials (four on one side) which become successively larger, the posterior as large as all the rest. Above the anterior of these are two other plates. On one side of the rostral plate, and above the first labial, is one with a nasal perforation in the center; but there is none corresponding to it on the other. Behind the terminal plate of the muzzle is a median onehalf its width (vertical?), and behind this another (occipital?) as wide as the first. This is subpentagonal, with two large plates in front connecting it to the terminal one and separated by the second median plate described. On each side of this plate are two, the anterior very small, and with another immediately below it. This largest central plate is thus encircled by nine plates—three anterior, four posterior, and two lateral. The entire head, exclusive of the lower jaw, has about forty plates. The teeth are long, conical, recurved, and distant. There are about three on each side of each jaw.
There are four labials on each side the median mental, which has another plate behind it, followed by two long narrow ones. A long plate against the inner labials connects anteriorly with the latter.
The body is encircled by a succession of whorls or rings of close Square pilates, about thirty in number. These are narrower above and broader below on the pectoral region (for about six whorls) than elsewhere. There is a distinct groove or furrow along the back, with an occasional tubercle in it. One in the ventral surface is much less distinct. The tail is short, contained about seventeen or eighteen times in head and body. It is much depressed and rounded at the tip; verticillate, but the plates on the upper surface, except anteriorly, are tubercular, rounded and raised, set in the midst of smaller ones. There are fifteen caudal whorls on the under surface.
This very curious saurian form was first introduced into the North American fauna by Dr. Barratt, who found it at Micanopy, Florida, where it is said to be not uncommon, and to be frequently ploughed up in the potato patches. It is probably entirely subterranean in its mode of life. It has been since found in nearly all parts of the Floridan zoological district. Living specimens sent me by Mr. C. B. Moore are of a beautiful rose-purple color with a milky bloom, such as is seen on some fruits. Three distinct purple stripes radiate from the head pos: teriorly, but are soon lost in the surrounding color.
The specimens were sent me in damp sand, in which they burrowed and remained concealed. Unfortunately they lived but a short time, and a second sending met the same fate.

No limbs. Teeth anchylosed to the alveolar ridges.
The dentition of this family resembles that of the Acrodonta. It does not differ in other respects from the Amphisbeenidz. There are but three genera, and these are confined to the Old World. They differ as follows:
No preanal pores; two pairs of upper head shields; nostril pierced in a nasal. Trogonophis Kaup. Preanal pores; three large upper head shields besides the rostral; nostril pierced between twi0 Nasal s\jape eee eee eee eee Pachycalamus Giinther. Preanal pores; a single large upper head shield; nostril pierced in a nasal. Agamodon Peters.
Trogonophis has but one species, which is found in northwest Africa. Pachycalamus has a single species, which is an inhabitant of the island of Socotra, off the coast of east Africa. The only species of Agamodon is east African.
There is much uniformity in the characters of the skeleton in the
Serpentes. Peculiarities characterize the principal divisions, but no —
definite groups can be traced in the great mass of the harmless snakes, so far as the skeleton is concerned.
Skull.—The premaxillary bone is connected with the skull by only its superior and inferior spines in all snakes except the Scolecophidia, where it is connected by suture laterally and inferiorly with the ethmoid also, and in the Epanodonta with the maxillary. In other snakes the ethmoid lies above its inferior spine. The nasals are always distinct from each other, except in Charina, where they are coossified. They are also free laterally, except in Scolecophidia, Tortricina, and many peropodous genera, where they are suturally united posteriorly and laterally with the prefrontals. Such are the genera Loxocemus,

<<<Page: 714>>>

Lichanura, Charina, and Eryx, and to these must be added Xenopeltis. The frontals are always distinct and the parietals are always united. The supraoccipital never enters the foramen magnum, which is bounded above by the exoccipitals. The prefrontals are articulated above with the frontals and, in the divisions above named, with the nasals also. The postfrontals are present, but are small and easily lost in preparing crania in some types. They are generally well developed, but are small in Lichanura and Cylindrophis, and are wanting in Xenopeltis, Charina, Ilysia, the Scolecophidia, and the Elapide. They are elongate and extended forward over the orbit to the prefrontals in Achrochordidse and Nothopide. There is a supraorbital bone in the Pythonide. The parocecipital is included in the cranial walls in all angiostomatous snakes, and is excluded from the brain case, lying scale-like on the surface, in the eurystomatous families. It is short in burrowing snakes, but elongates in other families, reaching an extreme length in the solenoglyphous division. The maxillary bone is loosely attached in Serpentes, having a close articulation with the prefrontal only, except in the Epanodonta, where it is fixed firmly to the premaxillary and vomers, as in lizards. It is shortened anteriorly in the Proteroglypha, and both anteriorly and posteriorly in the Solenoglypha, so as to become subvertical. Among the latter it is solid in all except the Crotalide, where it is deeply excavated by a fossa postero-exteriorly. In the Opoterodonta the maxillary is also very short and triangular, articulating very loosely with the prefrontal with its narrow apex. In snakes there are no lachrymal nor jugal bones. In proportion as the maxillary is abbreviated posteriorly, is the ectopterygoid elongated. The latter is generally a simple element, but in certain Najid genera it is deeply bifureate anterioriy, according to Boulenger.
The lateral walls of the brain case consist apparently of the frontal, parietal, and petrosal bones, which articulate below with the presphenoid, sphenoid, and basioccipital elements. At the base of the orbital wall of the frontal is a longitudinal groove, bounded below by the presphenoid, which is occupied by the more or less persistent trabecula eranii. The optic foramen is large, and becomes a vacuity in types with large eyes, as Bascanium, and according to Boulenger those of opposite sides are confluent in Psammophis. The trigeminus foramen is represented by two, which communicate beneath a long bridge in all snakes, including Typhlops (Glauconia not examined), The quadrate bone presents some diversities of form, but none of great importance. In Typhlops it is short and flat, and presents a free angular process anteriorly. In Glauconia it is long and slender, and has no anterior process. In the Tortricina it is very short, and has in the Llysiide a cylindric shaft. In Asinea it is generally flat and expanded at the proximal end, and has no angular process of the shaft, but in Pryx it is not expanded, and has a triangular section. In Xenopeltis it is short, and has a short posterior projection proximally, as in lizards. In the

<<<Page: 715>>>

boas and pythons it has a short anterior process on the inner side with which the columella auris articulates. The process is very short in — Eryx, and an articular facet only remains in Loxocemus, Lichanura, and Charina. In the venomous snakes it is so elongate as to articulate — with the superior disk of the paroccipital, extending to the inner border | in the Solenoglypha. {
The base of the skull presents certain diversities in the more distinct suborders.
There is much difference as to the extent to which the free edges of the presphenoid extend outside of the trabecular grooves, concealing them from view from below, or whether they are angulate or not. In some genera the basioccipital supports one to three hypapophyses for muscular insertion, and in a few genera the sphenoid bone supports basi— pterygoid processes or tuberosities, accompanied or not with a median — keel. In Solenoglypha the long median simple hypapophysis is constantly present, and in the Peropoda there are nearly always basipterygoids. Beyond this these characters are specific only, or connected A with the size and vigor of the individual. The following table will —

I. Internal and external processes present. Colubride, Xenapeltide, Charina, Python (the internal small), Glauconia. ;

Ill. Internal, but no external processes. Hlaps, Typhlops.
IV. Neither internal nor external processes. Hydrophis, Causus, Vipera, Ancistrodon, Crotalophorus, Crotalus.

<<<Page: 716>>>

In all genera the palatine bone is longitudinal and compressed except in the Scolecophidia, where it is so short as to be transverse. The pterygoids are elongate and extend to the quadrate except in the Scolecophidia. In the Opoterodonta they are cylindric, and extend beyond the quadrate, while in the Epanodonta they are flattened and do not quite reach the latter. They are generally compressed so as to present a vertical lamina, but in peropodous genera, especially in those with basipterygoid processes, they are expanded inward so as to be horizontal. They are also horizontal in Yenopeltis. The compressed form is related to the greatest mobility, and is hence most developed in the Solenogiypha. HKetopterygoids are present in all the superfamilies except the Scolecophidia. They are longest where the maxillaries are shortest, that is, in the Solenoglypha.
The mandible in Serpentes always lacks the surangular bone, and the angular is small and far anterior to the angle of the jaw, which is formed by the articular. The coronoid is absent, excepting in the Scolecophidia, Tortricina, and Peropoda, except Charina, where it is wanting. The splenial is always present, and is internal exclusively, except in Typhlops, where it is more extensively developed on the external than on the internal side, leaving the dentary but a narrow strip. In Typhlops also the angular is a very small splint, between the splenial and the base of the coronoid on the external side of the jaw. The Meckellan groove is open in many snakes, and in others it is closed by the apposition of the edges of the dentary and splenial bones. In some species it is open only for a short distance. It is open in Crotalide, Viperide, and Hydrophide, and in Ilysiidw, Boidxe, Pythonide, Chari nid, and Xenopeltid. It is also open in the following genera of Colubride: Natrix, Butenia, Heterodon, Coluber, Ophibolus, Diadophis, Cyclophis, Liopeltis, Salvadora, Rhinochilus, Haldea, Virginia, Storeria, Abastor and Farancia. In Osceola it is partly open; while it is closed in Typhlops, Elaps, Causus, Sibon, Spilotes, Bascanium, and Carphophiops. Thus the open groove is probably characteristic of Crotalide, Viperide, Hydrophidie, the Peropoda, and the Homalopsinze. Further than this no definite boundaries can be yet traced by it.
The teeth of snakes are not furnished with roots, and are not sunk in alveoli, but their bases are coossified with the bones which bound the mouth. They have simple, acutely conic crowns with an oval section, sometimes with a sharp angle posteriorly when a cutting edge is present. In certain genera (Opisthoglypha) there is a groove on the anterior or external face (Ogmius) of the posterior one or two teeth of the maxillary bone. In one genus all the maxillary teeth are grooved (Ogmodon); while in the venomous species it is the anterior teeth which have undergone modification. In the Proteroglypha the anterior tooth is deeply grooved on the anterior face, and the edges of the groove have grown forward and inward so as to be in contact, thus

<<<Page: 717>>>

inclosing a tube. In the Solenoglypha this union has become complete fusion so that no trace of the primitive groove remains, although it is distinct in individuals at birth. The foramen at the anterior base of this tooth in Proteroglypha and Solenoglypha receives the papilliform
extremity of the efferent duct of the salivary poison gland, and thus
conducts the poison to the slit-like opening at the front apex of the crown.
The tongue is long and cylindric, and is retractile into a sheath which opens in the anterior part of the floor of the mouth immediately in front of the glottis. Its free extremity is deeply bifurcate. It is the only tactile organ of the Serpentes.
The alimentary canal is elongate, and the stomach is a simple enlargement of its diameter, without transverse curvature. It passes gradually into the small intestine, which is more or less convoluted by short turns which adhere together and are inclosed in a common peritoneal fold, which does not follow the convolutions, as is the case in Sauria and other Vertebrata. The rectum is straight, of enlarged diameter, and of variable length. it is separated from the small intestine by a muscular constriction, which is passed at one side by a narrow communicating tube, which frequently leaves a rectal cecum at one side. The walls of the stomach are often thickened, while those of the small intestine are variable, and are frequently densely papillose. The rectum presents a variety of internal structure. Its internal wall is smooth in Hunectes murinus, Eryx thebaicus, acd Cyiindrophis rufa. It has longitudinal plicas in Jlysia scytale, Coluber obsoletus, Compsosoma corais, Zamenis flagellum, Natrix taxispilotus, Homalopsis leucobalia, Hydrophis striata. With longitudinal folds there are transverse ones more or less developed in Ophibolus polyzonus, Malpolon lacertinum, Dryophis prasina, Chersydrus granulatus. There are free transverse foids more or less developed in Leptognathus fasciata, Dipsas dendrophila, Oxybelis acuminata, Vipera ammodytes, Crotalus durissus. The rectum is divided by transverse septa, with a perforation median or lateral, in Python spilotis, Farancia abacura, Boodon geometricus, Elaps surinamensis, Bungarus sp., Ancistrodon contortrix.
The salivary glands are labial or externai to the maxillary and mandibular bones, and have numerous efferent ducts. In opistheglyph snakes that portion of them which is opposite the posterior maxillary teeth is enlarged, and the secretion is discharged at the bases of the grooves of the teeth. In proteroglyph and solenoglyph snakes this gland is still further developed, and fills the space between the orbit and quadrate bones. Its efferent duct extends as a tube along the superior surface of the maxillary bone. In the genus Causus this gland is greatly elongate, extending posteriorly above the ribs for one-sixth the length of the animal(Reinhardt). In the Elapid genus Adeniophis the gland is restricted to a position corresponding to the posterior extremity of that of Causus, and has in consequence an efferent duct of extraordinary length (Meyer). In these types a portion of the tem-

poral muscle extends over the poison gland and compresses it when the mouth is opened. In the venomous groups the anterior glands are reduced. Besides the labial glands there is a gland anterior to the prefrontal region, between the maxillary and nasal bones. The liver is long and narrow, and is on the right side of the alimentary canal, and begins immediately posterior to the heart or at various distances posterior to it, according to the genus. Thusit is near the heart in species of robust form, as the Viperidz and Crotalide, and in such genera as XYenodon and Heterodon. It is far removed in the Tortricina, Epanodonta, and Catodonta. It is exceptionally short in Chersydrus. Its distal extremity is bilobate, and the left lobe extends beyond the right. From between the two issues the cystic duct, which extends to and along the alimentary canal to the position of the gall bladder. » This structure is remarkable in Serpentes for its distance from the liver. It is near to the spleen, which is adherent to the alimentary canal on its inferior side, and is of a subround form. The pancreas, which is of more elongate form but of relatively small size, is located near the spleen on the left side of the alimentary canal.
The disposition of the parts of the circulatory system in the Serpentes is dependent in large degree on the elongate form of these animals and on the arrangement of their respiratory organs.
Although the heart is situated cephalad of the posttracheal lung, its position is posterior to that which it occupies in the Sauria. In Chersydrus it is situated at about the middle of the length of the body, but in the Natrices it is at the anterior fifth of the length. It is of rather elongate form, and its chambers are compactly adherent, and it is inclosed in a tough pericardial sac. In adult snakes there is but one aorta root on each side, of which the left is the most robust. The common pulmonary trunk is distinct from the truncus arteriosus to the base. It was first observed by Schlemm! that in typical Colubroidea there is but one pulmonary artery, while in the Peropoda there are two. He also observed that where there is a tracheal lung there is an anterior pulmonary artery, as in Vipera berus, while in Lachesis mutus there are two. In Thrasops flavigularis, where the trachea is expanded transversely to the size of a tracheal lung, I have observed that there is an anterior pulmonary artery. There is generally a single carotid artery, which arises from the right aorta root. This may branch into two carotids, and in a few instances these carotids maintain their distinctness to the aorta root. The right aorta root also gives forth an anterior artery, the arteria vertebralis of Cuvier, which supplies the intercostal arteries. It extends along the right side of the vertebral column, or divides, each half running on one side of the column. The celiac artery is divided into several. The mesenteric is represented by two trunks which leave the aorta at a considerable distance apart.

<<<Page: 719>>>

The ophthalmic artery is divided from the facial, according to Rathke, excepting in the Peropoda and Angiostomata, where it rises from the arteria cerebralis. The latter is the primitive foetal connection in all snakes. ;
The cardinal veins are unimportant in the Serpentes, the posterior
vena cava having taken their place. This vessel originates at the
kidneys, being formed by the successive union of numerous vene renales revehentes, and extends to the liver. Itrunsin a groove of the superior side of this organ, and receives venc hepatice along its course, and then passing above the heart enters the sinus venosus on the right side of the right auricle. Authors differ in their accounts of the origin of the vena cava. Schlemm states that it is formed by the union of two branches, one from each kidney, while Stannius states that it is derived from theright kidney only. In an anaconda (Hunectes murinus) I traced it easily from the right kidney, but was not successful in following the left renalis revehens to a junction with the right, though I can not assert that none exists. I found the junction to be near the left testis in a Coluber quadrivitiatus. The kidneys receive each a vein which corresponds to the vena iliaca of the Sauria, which are derived from a single vena caudalis. In Chersydrus there is a second large vessel running from the liver to the heart, which may be a vena hepatica.
The anterior caudal diapophyses of the Serpentes are bifurcate in a vertical plane. Between these branches are placed the lymphatics,
which empty by asmall vein into the vena iliaca. The thymus gland isa ;
small elongate body lying near each carotid on each side, and near the — heart. The thyroid gland is near the auricles of the heart on the middle _ line. Suprarenal bodies are present near the testis or ovaries, lying
along the vene renales revehentes. THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.
This system includes the larynx, trachea, and lungs. The characters of the larynx in the various groups of snakes have not yet been worked
out. A small tubercie may be observed at the anterior canthus of the © .
glottis in many snakes. In two genera of Colubrine it is developed
into a compressed vertical epiglottis, which by its rapid vibrations on
the expulsion of air from the lungs produces a considerable noise
(Epiglottophis, Pityophis). The trachea in the Serpentes is not divided into bronchial tubes, but where there are two lungs it is discontinued
at the bifurcation, except in the case of the presence of a rudimental — right lung. In this case the wall of the trachea is perforated by a — foramen which communicates (rarely by a tube) directly with the rudi—
mental lung. In such a case the tracheal cartilages may be continued
for a long distance as a band on the left lung (genera Halsophis, —
Pityophis).
The lungs are sacs surrounded by a layer of reticulate bars or lamin of greater or less thickness. The bars are most robust at the anterior part of the lung, and become more attenuated and inclose

<<<Page: 720>>>

larger spaces toward the distal regions. In many species, especially the Solenoglypha, the distal part of the lung has very thin membranous walls. In Chersydrus the reticulate structure continues to the extremity, and the tracheal lung has no lumen. The left lung does not usually extend beyond the gall bladder, but in Chersydrus it extends to the anus. The post-tracheal or true lungs begin opposite the ventricle of the heart, or just posterior to it. The rudimental right lung, when present, is situated near the apex of the heart.
The condition of knowledge as to the character of the lungs of snakes was stated by Stannius, in 1856,! as follows:
The detailed accounts as to the single or double character of the lungs leave much to be desired. Among Ophidia Angiostomata there possess a single sac, Rhinophis and all Typhlopidw which have been examined; as to the Tortricide , there are apparently species with two lungs (7. xenopeltis) (= Xenopeltis unicolor], and others with a single lung (7. scytale) . Among Eurystomata, all the Peropoda (Boa, Python, Eryx) possess apparently two lungs. The Calamarina that have been investigated have one lung. Among Colubrina and Glyphodonta there are great variations. All the Coronelle of Schlegel possess, according to Schlegel, a single lung. I find the lung single in Rhachiodon scaber variabilis possesses, according to Schlegel, the rudiment of a second lung. According to the statement of Meckel, this rudiment is common in Coluber. The Xenodons have, according to Schlegel, a single lung (X. severus and X. rhabdocephalus). In Heterodon I find a rudimental second lung. The Lycodons, according to Schlegel, possess a single lung; as also do Psammophis and Homalopsis. In Dendrophis colubrina Schlegel found the rudiment of theseconé tung. In Dipsas, according to Schlegel, there are variations; but hestates that D. multimaculata, D. levis, and D. annulata have but ons lung. The Achrochordina have but one lung. Among Hydrophide I found in three species of Hydrophis the lung sac simple. Meckel states that Platurus has a very small rudiment of a second lung. Among the remaining poisonous snakes there is an insignificant rudiment of the second lung in the Elapinaand Crotalina; while the Viperina possess an entirely simple lung.
In 1894 I presented to the American Philosophical Society” the results of my studies on this subject, in which I added many observations to those previously made, and discovered a number of important systematic indications. I also found occasion to correct some of the statements quoted by Stannius from Schlegel, as above noted. I give here the results presented in that paper:
The snakes with rudimental posterior limbs (Peropoda) show in the character of their lungs what they show in the rudimental limbs themselves, and in the hemipenis, the nearest relationships to the Lacertilia. They possess, with an exception to be noted later, two well-developed lungs, one of which is larger than the other. The smaller lung lies to the right side and ventrally, while the larger one lies to the left side and dorsally. In some species the dorsal ana ventral relation is more pronounced than in others. In the Colubroidea the right or ventral lung is generally present, but of very much reduced proportions, the usual size being from 2-5 mm. in length. It is connected with the other lung by a foramen, which perforates the tracheal cartilage at a point a little beyond the apex of the heart, and opposite to
1 Zootomie der Amphibien, p. 108. 2 Proceedings Amer. Phil. Soc., XXXIII, 1894, p. 217.

<<<Page: 721>>>

the proximal part of the dorsal lung. It is sometimes connected to the dorsal lung by a short tube, in which cartilaginous half rings are seen in but two of the genera examined, viz, Heterodon and Conophis. The lumen of the rudimental lung may be lined by the same reticulate structure as is seen in the dorsal lung, or its walls may be smooth. In some Colubroidea the rudimental lung is absent, but such species are relatively few.
The dorsal lung may present proximally alongside of the trachea an auricle or :
pocket, and this is so developed in the genus Heterodon as to reach to the head without communication with the trachea other than that furnished by the normal portion of the lung. In the Solenoglypha, without exception, this extension of the dorsal lung is present, and extends to the head, and its lumen is continuous with the trachea throughout its length. The same structure exists in the genera Hydrus and Hydrophis, and also in the peropodous genus Ungalia, which differs besides from other Peropoda in having but one post-tracheal lung. Finally, the tracheal lung, as I have called it, is distinct from the true lung in Platurus and in Chersydrus. In the former of these genera the trachea is not separate from the ]umen, while in Chersydrus it is distinct. It, however, communicates with the cells of which the lung consists in this genus by a series of regularly placed foramina on each side. There is no lumen in the tracheal lung in Chersydrus. In Typhlops we have a still further modification of the tracheal lung. It is without lumen, and is composed of coarse cells of different sizes. These have no communication with the trachea or lung that I can discover, nor any efferent orifice. It has occurred to me that this structure, which extends from the heart to the throat, may not be a pulmonary organ.
I have referred to the dorsal and ventral positions of the two lungs. ~ The rudimental lung is to the right of the dorsal lung in the Colubroidea, but in the Iysiidx it is to the left. It is quite questionable which lung this rudiment in this family really represents. In the Typhlopid:e the single lung is on the right side and extends from the heart to the liver. It has the position of the rudimental lung of the Colubroidea, and may represent it. I can not decide this question without further material. In Glauconia there is but one true lung, and this is ventral in position, and originates to the right of the heart, so that in this genus also it may represent the rudimental lung of the Colubroidea. There is here no tracheal lung or organ.'!
I now give a synopsis of the characters observed in the species examined.
Glauconia dulcis Baird and Girard. A single elongate right lung; no rudiment of left lung. No tracheal lung. EPANODONTA.
Typhlops liberiensis Hallowell; T. reticulatus Linnzus. A right lung which is not elongate; no rudimental left lung. A cellular body surrounding the trachea, and extending from the heart to the throat, without lumen or connection with the trachea or lung.
The presence of the tracheal lung (?) and the freedom of the maxillary bone are points of resemblance to the Solenoglypha!
TORTRICINA. Tlysiide.

Appendix to Colubride.
In the African Thrasops flavigularis Hallowell the right (rudimental) lung measures 5mm. The trachea is enormously expanded transversely, simulating a tracheal lung, but its inferior wall contains the tracheal cartilages, which extend its entire width, and it contains no cells or trabecule. An artery with lateral branches extends its entire length, which is from the posttracheal lung to the throat. This character distinguishes this genus from Leptophis.
In the following species I found no trace of the right lung:

The rudimental lung is often concealed from view and difficult to discover. The best test of its presence is the foramen which connects it with the trachea, which will generally be found piercing the cartilage of the latter near the apex of the heart. The rudimental organ may then be found by inserting a bristle, and observing its destination through the more or less transparent tissues. In but one instance have I found a rudimental lung without a connecting foramen, viz, in the Mexican Ficimia olivacea. On the other hand, the foramen may terminate in a small blind sac.
The pulmonary characters may be determined without much dissection. The position of the heart must be first ascertained, and a longitudinal median incision made in the abdominal wall. In all forms except the Epanodonta and Catodonta the trachea will be fonnd passing to the left side of the heart and entering the lung hear its apex. By splitting the trachea not too near its abdominal border, on turning the free margin upward as the snake lies on its back, the foramen bronchiale will be seen, and its lumen can be explored. The trachea is concealed by the esophagus, which must be drawn to the left side of the body in order to make the examination. The examination of the tracheal lung requires the division of the abdominal wall further toward the head.
The Serpentes possess no urinary bladder, but the ureters empty by separate orifices into the cloaca. The kidneys are unsymmetrically placed, that of the right side being anterior to that of the left. They are transversely lobate. The testes and ovaries are situated considerably anterior to the kidneys, and are similarly unsymmetrically placed, that of the right side being anterior to that of the left. The vas deferens is closely folded in its proximal portion, and runs along the external side of the kidney, where it is accompanied by the ureter. The two

<<<Page: 725>>>

ducts continue near or close together to the cloaca. The ovaries are within elongate folds of the peritoneum. ‘The oviduct is near the edge of a deeper fold of the peritoneum on each side, and extends from near the cephalic extremity of the ovary to a common chamber or vagina, which is above tne rectum, and opens into the cloaca. This vaginal chamber is large, and is divided more or less completely in the Solenoglyph snakes, is about half divided or deeply bilobate in the Colubroidea, and is undivided in the Peropoda. Its external wall is deeply longitudinally grooved, and the internal wall is transversely grooved in Crotalus. In Colubroidea generally it is deeply longitudinally grooved onallsides. In the Peropoda it is nearly or quite smooth. Thecephalic extremity of the oviduct is for a short distance transversely plicate or lobate, the labia being held in place by simple unfolded bands of the inferior and superior edges. The fontanelle is immediately cephalad of this region, and has very thin simple walls. Being only a slit, it is sometimes difficult to discover. The oviducts do not accompany the ureters so closely as do the vasa deferentia, and approach nearer the middle line for a short distance below the rectum.
Like the Sauria the male Serpentes possess two intromittent organs or hemipenes. Each is a cylindrie hollow body, which when not in use is retracted in a corresponding cavity on one side of the middle line of the tail. Into its posterior extremity is inserted a cylindrical muscle, which is continued posteriorly to a length generally greater than that of the hemipenis, to an origin on a caudal vertebra. When the hemipenis is in use it is protruded, and its inner surface is evaginated and becomes the external surface, the muscle just described occupying its center. It enters the vagina of the female and its extremity occupies the corresponding anterior lobe of the latter when present. It is withdrawn by the contraction of the central muscle or retractor penis. The hemipenis is generally armed with reverted or recurved spines. When this is the case the vaginal walls are very tough. . When the hemipenis is unarmed the vaginal walls are thinner and smoother.
I have described the characters of the surface of the hemipenis in 1893,! and have shown that they furnish good indications of affinity and diversity among the snakes. The details then reported will be found under the head of classification. The general characters may be summarized as follows:
The hemipenis of the Serpentes is traversed by a groove which divides the external investment to the internal integument (or external integument when the organ is retracted), which begins at the base internally, and soon turns to the external side of the organ and continues to its extremity. This is the suleus spermaticus. This sulcus is usually bifurcated in venomous snakes, and I find it to be equally bifur-
‘American Naturalist, XXIII, p. 477; Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, XVIII, 1894, p. 186.

<<<Page: 726>>>

cated in many harmless snakes. The investing tissues may or may not correspond with this bifurcation. Thus the hemipenis may be more or less bifurcate. Schlegel states that it is bifurcate in venomous snakes, but it is not so in Hydrophis hardwickit, Bungarus semifasciatus, Hoplocephalus coronatus, ete., while it is bifurcate in many nonvenomous forms. Next to the bifercation of the sulcus in importance, is the nature of the surface of the external investment (internal when retracted). In the most perfect types, both venomous and nonvenomous, this surface is reticulate like tripe, the inclosed areas forming calyces, which may have a suctorial function. Their borders are generally papillose, and are sometimes so deeply divided into papille as to lose their original character. These papillae may be the seat of osseous deposit, becoming bristles or spines, which become larger toward the middle of the length, and lose their mutual membranous connections. These isolated spines may extend to the apex, but they rarely extend to the base. The surface may, however, be laminate and not reticulate, and the lamin may be longitudinal or transverse. In either of these cases they may not be spiniferous. The apex or apices of the organ may be furnished with a rigid papilla orawn. The entire surface of the organ when protruded is designed for the maintainance of its position in the oviduct of the female, from which it can not be withdrawn excepting by invagination.
In the Tortricina and Peropoda the hemipenis is not spinous, and the sulcus is bifercate, and in the Boidie the hemipenis is bifurcate also, although in some genera (Xiphosoma, Ungualia) the branches are very short. The external integument is never reticulate, but is always laminate with elongate papillx at the extremities, in Hpicrates, Xiphosoma, and Ungualia. The lamin are pinnate from the suleus as an axis in Morelia, Enygrus, Lichanura, and Eryx, and are transverse in Charina. In Ilysia they are pinnate, with a few longitudinai plice below.
The principal variations in the Colubroidea are as follows:
No spines; surface longitudinally plicate; the surface of the hemipenis is flounced more or less transversely; the surface is more or less reticulate, and the sulcus spermaticus is undivided; hypapophyses anterior; the surface is reticulate or longitudinally plicate, and the sulcus is divided; hypapophyses anterior; the surface is neither reticulate nor flounced, and the spines when present are disconnected; hypapophyses continued to caudal vertebre.
Similar gradations in the characters of the hemipenis are to be seen in the types of venomous snakes. Thus in the Proteroglypha this organ is spinous to the tip, on a calyculate basis, in Hydrophis, Elaps (surinamensis), Dendraspis. It is reticulate at the extremities and spinous below, in Callophis (bivirgatus), Naja, Acanthophis, Bungarus, and Sepedon; the apex smooth in the two genera last named. In Flaps nigrocinctus the organ is usually smooth, with a few spines at the apex.

<<<Page: 727>>>

In Solenoglypha the genus Atractaspis is spinous to the apex, apparently on a longitudinally laminate basis. In the Viperidz and Crotaiide the spines are on a flounced basis. The apices are calyculate in Bitis, Clotho, and Vipera, and spinous in Cerastes. They are calyculate in Crotalide, in Bothrops, Ancistrodon, Sistrurus, Crotalus, and Uropsophus. In Crotalus (durissus of the Neotropical fauna) the median spines are replaced by papille; in all the other genera they are spinous.
Diversity of lung structure accompanies the primary groups which are characterized by peculiarities of the skeleton to such a degree that we are warranted in according it. a high systematic value. Thus Angiostomatous and Peropodous snakes have two lungs, while the Colubroidea have one and a rudiment, and the Solenoglypha always have a tracheal lung. Exceptions and variations from these rules thus become of importance. Thus I have no doubt of the propriety of the separation of the Ungaliide from the other Peropoda, on account of its pulmonary characters. Nor is there any doubt in my mind of the necessity of the separation of the Leptognathinze from the Xenodontine, on account of its large tracheal lung. The very marked characters of the genus Chersydrus characterize the family, as well as the osteological characters. It remains to be seen whether the family I
termed the Nothopidz, but which Boulenger unites with the Chersy©
dridze agrees with it in pulmonary characters. The remarkable tracheal lung or gland distinguishes the Epanodonta from the Catodonta, emphasizing the differences observed in the osteology of the skull. The huge diverticulum of Heterodon serves to distinguish the genus from its allies. The extraordinary transverse dilatation of the trachea in Thrasops establishes the genus as distinct.
The value of the rudimental right lung as a character of the Colubroidea is increased by my investigations. In only two genera have 1 found it either present or absent, namely, Halsophis and Pityophis. I am not sure but that I may yet find it in the P. melanoleucus, where L have failed hitherto, but I am sure that it is present in some species of Halsophis and wanting in others. A natural group of American Colubrine, appears to be characterized by its absence, namely, Rhinochilus, Cemophora, and Ophibolus; all genera with an entire anal shield. The development of cartilages in the bronchial foramen or tube of the rudimental lung is not a constant character. I found it in one Heterodon platyrhinus and not in another; it is present in Conophis pulcher, but absent in C. sumichrestii.
The numerous characters presented by the hemipenis have various values. Several very distinct types are distinguishable, but they are continuous at some point, through intermediate forms. This is, however, the history of all characters which distinguish organic beings, especially of those which have been relied on as characters of the

<<<Page: 728>>>

minor divisions and genera of the Serpentes. The characters which I have discovered in the hemipenis have added greatly to our resources in the attempt to learn the relationships and hence origin of the members of the Serpentes.
In a broad way we may distinguish as leading types the following: The smooth; the plicate, or flounced; the calyculate, or ruched; and the disk-bearing. Any of these may have the sulcus spermaticus simple or bifurcate, and some of them may have the middle part of the organ spinous or not. The spines may extend to the apex so as to obliterate the pattern and the total organ may be bifurcate or not. As regards the indications of affinity presented by these types, it may be said that the nearer we approach the Sauria the less spinous is the organ, and the further away is the form the more.certainly wil! the ruched structure prevail. The tendency to bifurcation is present in most groups, but it is universal in but one suborder, the Solenoglypha, or specialized venomous snakes.
In the Oriental region we have the smoothest type of Colubroidea, which includes the genera really allied to Calamaria, many of which have had hitherto widely different positions in the systems. Owing to the searcity of specimens of this type in American museums, I have not been able to investigate them fully. The great Colubrine division is remarkably constant in its undivided sulcus and abundant calyces. In degenerate types the calyces become less nuinerous. The groovetoothed Dipsadines have the same structure. Except one Australian genus (Acanthophis) all the disciferous types are neotropical and all have a double suleus. The other neotropical types with double sulcus may be calyculate or spinous and they present a great variety of detail. Here again the glyphodont and aglyphodont types are quite parallel to each other. The structure in the water snakes is again different and characteristic. The organ is feebly spinous from the base to or near to the apex, possessing no calyces, disk, or transverse plice, and the prehensile function is maintained by one or a few large hook-shaped spines at the base. In 1864 I referred several genera which had been placed in the Calamarinz to the water snakes on account of the continuation of the hypapophyses to the tail. lL was much gratified on examining their hemipenes to find that they (genera Tropidoclonium, Virginia, and Haldea) present exactly the characters of the group to which the vertebre indicated that they should be referred. In like manner I have been able to refer genera supposed to belong to the Calamarine to almost every natural division of the Colubroidea by the study of the hemipenis. The old Calamarinz of authors is simply an aggregation of burrowing or degraded forms of several natural groups.
The Natricine (water snake) group is connected with the groovetoothed water snakes (Homalopsine), and both of these groups pass probably into the Lycodontine series, the typical forms of which the

<<<Page: 729>>>

spines are arranged in flounces. It is difficult as yet, and perhaps may not become easy, to distinguish some members of the Lycodont group from certain ground snakes with totally spinous hemipenis, especially certain African genera, as Hlapops, Grayia, and others. These questions remain for further research.
I have found the characters of the hemipenis as constant as those of any other part of the organism. Occasional irregularities are to be looked for, but the only one which I have met with is in the case of a specimen of Boodon infernalis from South Africa, in which the hemipenis is shortly bifurcate on one side and not so on the other. There is a tendency to bifurcation in some individuals of Ophibolus getulus which is not conspicuous in others, but this tendency does not appear in the suleus. Itis a tendency only. While certain characters of this organ, as already remarked, characterize series or groups of genera, others characterize the genera themselves. These are given in the analytical tables under the family and subfamily heads. On examining these tables it will be seen that the genera brought into close juxtaposition are frequently not most closely allied in general appearance. The keys are only intended to present the penial characters; are not intended to display the serial or other relationships of the genera among themselves.
I now give the exact definitions of the divisions as far as definable with present information. The definitions of the suborders are those of Miiller, modified by myself.'

family heads, which are not, with the exception of the Homalopsin, defined. It is not certain, therefore, that their contents are in all cases properly limited or distributed. It remains a desideratum to discover the characters of the natural divisions of the Colubrid, if any there be. The characters presented by Duméril and Bibron, and by Giinther, are important but insufficient. For the definition of the genera distinct characters exist, although the subject is one of much difficulty. The object of definition being, as I imagine, precision, and the consequent increased facility of determination, | have employed all struetural characters whatever, and only neglected them where it is evident that they are inconstant within the limits of a species. I find of the greatest importance the grooved or nongrooved characters of the posterior teeth, and the absence or number of the scale pits. The division or nondivision of the anal scutum is also of much importance, although in a very few genera (for example Xenodon) it is not constant. Relying, as the system always must, on exact characters, I have not allowed considerations of ‘‘physiognomy” to change a result where it conflicts with structure, which is, however, rarely the case. The tendency of some authors to neglect characters and to depend on “ physiognomy” destroys precision and explains nothing, besides rendering identification of species most laborious, resting as it must in that case on purely empirical methods. I also do not use as generic characters the number of rows of scales, or of labial scuta, believing that these are only available in the distinction of species.
In a few instances I have not been able to examine the skeletons of genera of doubtful position, so that their reference to a family division may yet have to be altered. I have, however, studied the fine series in the museums of Paris and Washington, besides a considerable number in my own collection. For the characters of many genera which | have not seen I have had to rely on the descriptions of others, especially those of the recently issued second edition of the Catalogue of Snakes, in the British Museum, by Boulenger.
Ill. PHYLOGENY.
The earliest snakes known to paleontologists have been found in the Upper Cretaceous beds of Europe and North America, those of the former region being a little the older. -Some of these are allied to the Boas, while others are said by Sauvage to display characters of the Epanodonta. But few specimens are known, and these are vertebra, so that their characters remain uncertain. Marsh has described some ophidian vertebre from the Laramie beds of the Rocky Mountain region. I have described the genus Helagras from rather numerous vertebra from the Puerco bed of New Mexico. An interesting peculiarity of this genus is the imperfection of the zygantrum in some vertebree and the robustness of the neural spine. Next in time are the Paleophids, vertebree of which Owen first discovered in the English

<<<Page: 731>>>

Eocene, and I subsequently obtained from the marine Eocene of New Jersey. These snakes were of large size, and display points of resemblance to the Boidze. Venomous snakes first appear in the Upper Miocene. Viperidw were found by Lartet in France, and I have found
Crotalidw in the corresponding (Loup Fork) bed in Kansas. The evi— |
dence from paleontology, then, is, so far, that the Peropoda appeared — sarlier in time and the Solenoglypha later. This is in accordance with their systematic relations. However, we have little to base an actual phylogeny upon, from the paleontological evidence at present, and we — can only draw inferences from structural characters in their relation to other groups of reptiles, and especially to the other orders of the Squamata. It is probable that the Peropoda are the earliest and ancestral form of the Serpentes, since they display characters in both the skeleton, penial structure and viscera, which approach the Sauria. The Scolecophidia are allied to them, but can not be regarded as ancestral, but rather as degenerate descendauts, being connected with them by the intervening group of the Tortricina. On the other hand, the ascending series may be traced through the Colubroidea to the Solenoglypha. Among the Colubroidea we may regard the Aglyphodonta as nearest the Peropoda and the Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha as side branches. The latter lead to the Solenoglypha. We know of no direct transitions between Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha, but the genera Ogmodon Peters and Glyphodon Giinther, which have numerous erooved teeth, furnished an ancestral type from which both could have been derived. The Platycerca, some of which Boulenger shows have grooved teeth behind the fangs, may have been derived from the same source. This phylogeny may be schematically represented as follows:
SOLENOGLYPHA SCOLECOPHIDIA OPISTHOGLYPHA PROTEROGLYPHA TORTRICINA AGLYPHODONTA ok re. PEROPODA
This diagram is closely similar to one published by Boulenger, with whose conclusions I entirely agree.! Degeneracy has played an important part in the history of the Ser-
I had already stated the same conclusions in general in 1885 in the American Naturalist. See Origin of the Fittest, 1887, p. 334.

<<<Page: 732>>>

pentes, although they form as a whole an ascending line. The line of the Tortricina and Scolecophidia is such, as already remarked, and these are approached by the ground Peropoda, as Hryx, Charina, ete. Nearly every division of the ascending line exhibits degenerate side branches, and mostly of a similar type. Thusin the Opisthoglypha we have thesmall burrowing type of Tantilla and similar forms in America, and in Africa Aparallactus and others. Of Proteroglypha, Hlaps shows a tendency in the same direction, and in Vermicella (Australia) it is more pronounced. The same thing is observable in most of the divisions of the Aglyphodonta. The Old World Calamarine, which approach nearest the Peropoda, present many such types. In the Aglyphodont series the acquisition of the calyculate structure of the hemipenis with spines is evidence of advanced type, the flounced character being inferior and directly affiliated with the Calamarian and Peropodin. We have in the Colubrine examples of degenerate types ° (mostly in Central America), where the calyces become reduced in number and the proportion of spines increased in connection with degeneracy in other respects. The same degeneracy in primal structure may take place when the flounces become obsolete and spines only are left. It is possible that the Natricine group acquired its primal character in this way, without having passed through a calyculate stage. This group also has its specially degenerate forms in America, as Storeria, Virginia, and Haldea.
Among the Solenoglypha we have a conspicuous example of degeneracy in the African genus Atractaspis, which, like the other examples above cited, is a burrower in its habits. In external appearance it considerably resembles the Opisthoglyph genus Aparaliactus, of the same region. Degeneracy of the hemipenis by loss of calyces and extension of spines is seen in the genera Cerastes and Echis.
The degeneracy so far referred to consists in the reduction of the mechanism of rapid movement, the contraction of the mouth parts, the reduction of the eyes, and the shortening of the tail. All of these consequences have probably resulted from the adoption of a more or less subterranean life, or ‘“ earth-parasitism,” as I have termed it, as they certainly are associated in life. Another kind of degeneracy, which is less common, is the attenuation of bones surrounding the mouth and the reduction in number and size of the teeth, conditions associated with the use of soft food, as caterpillars, etc. This is exhibited by the family of the Amblycephalidie, which live in the forests of the Indian and neotropical regions. Accompanying the reduction of the jaws is an abbreviation of the muzzle, which, with the large eye, gives a very foetal character to the head.
Having thus cleared the main lines of degenerate complications, we could trace the ascending series of the Aglyphodonta, had we the material. This is unfortunately insufficient. That the Natricinie are a distinct line is attested by their continued vertebral hypapophyses,

<<<Page: 733>>>

as well as by the penial structure. Probably the following scheme expresses the history:
In this table the Lycodontine are not regarded as charactized by elongate anterior teeth as is usually done. Some of the genera are truly so characterized, as Lycodon and others, but they are off the main line. As to the Xenodontinz it is impossible to determine whether they are derived from Calamarinz (which are not now found in the same region with them) or whether they have come off the Colubrine by loss of calyces and development of apical disc.
Linnzus did not correctly distinguish the suborder Serpentes, but placed its species in a heterogenous assemblage,!' along with the suakelike lizards and the batrachian Ceeciliide. Laurenti, in 1768,’ followed him, changing the name to Serpentia.
The name Ophidia was proposed by Brongniart in 1799,° but the definition of this order, as he esteemed it, was not improved. In the system of Oppel (1811) * we find the Ophidia (which he spelled Ophidii), purged of all extraneous forms excepting the Amphisbienia. Under thenameSerpentia, Merrem, in 1820, adopted the group as left by Oppel. Wagler® finally reduced the division to its proper contents in 1830 and retained for it the name Serpentes. As this was the first publication in which the suborder, was properly limited, the name given must be™ retained. Duméril defined the group correctly, employing the Brongniartian namie Ophidia. In this he has been followed by most later authors, including Gray, Stannius, Owen, and Huxley.
As regards the contents of the suborder Serpentes, the first classification of a thorough character was that of J. Miiller, who in 1831,° divided the Serpentes into two divisions, the Microstomata (= Angiostomata) and Macrostomata (= Eurystomata), basing them on the proportions and position of the paroccipital bone or suspensorium of the quadrate; separating the Peropoda on account of the rudiments of pelvis. The next classification was that of Duméril, who with Bibron

investigated especially the dental structures and divided the order into Opoterodonta, Aglyphodonta, Opisthoglypha, Proteroglypha, and Solenoglypha. The first is Angiostomatous and the last four are Eurystomatous. In the system of Stannius' we have other than dental characters considered. Thus the Angiostomata are divided into Typhlopina and Tortricina, and the Eurystomata into Peropoda, Asinea, and Thanatophidia, the last including all of the venomous snakes. In 1845 Gray, in his catalogue of snakes in the British Museum, had combined forms with grooved posterior teeth and the colubriform venomous snakes with the harmless snakes under the name Colubroidea, and this arrangement was continued by Giinther in his catalogue of the Colubrine snakes of the British Museum in 1862. The author of the present work adopted a system which included the merits of those already in existence, adopting the divisions of Miiller and Stannius with those of Duméril, placing the Opisthoglypha with the true Colubroidea like Gray, but adopting for the entire group Stannius’s name, Asinea. I also rearranged some of the venomous genera in accordance with their cranial structure, which had been overlooked by previous authors. Finally, in the system of Boulenger, as adopted in the Catalogue of Snakes in the British Museum, the Opisthoglypha and Proteroglypha of Duméril are included in the Colubriform superfamily, as was done by Gray and Giinther. This division, Colubroidea, was then divided into Aglypha, Glyphodonta, and Proteroglypha.
The classification of the great mass of the Colubroid snakes has always been a difficult problem. Duméril relied on the relative proportions of the teeth, and established numerous “families” based upon them. These divisions are often not natural, while others are entirely tenable. On the whole, however, the larger divisions, based on proportionate lengths and apart from the grooving for conveying saliva, lack definition, owing to the insensible gradations which they present. The characters adduced by Duméril are, however, of general applicacation in the definition of genera. Their application has been extended by Boulenger, but to a degree of refinement which is in some cases not practicable, owing to gradations. Hence it became important to dis. cover other characters. This I have done in those exhibited by the the male intromittent organ and by the pulmonary structure. The former furnish many characters which express affinity or the reverse, and re-enforce or modify those which we have hitherto possessed.
The peculiar form of the snakes among vertebrate animals, their comparative abundance, and the fact that some of them are especially dangerous to life, invests them with more popular interest than any other group of reptiles.
The characteristics of the venomous forms will be pointed out in the
' Zootomie der Amphibien, 1856.

following pages. Meanwhile I will refer to the fact that while the general facies of the typical venomous snakes (Solenoglypha) is easily recognized by the eye, the characters of the frequently no less dangerous Proteroglypha are not so easily distinguished from those of the harmless ones. They are only to be distinguished by an especial knowledge of species or by an examination of the dentition. In the Columbian fauna we have but one genus which presents this determinate appearance, Hlaps, but in the warm regions of the Old World such genera abound, and in Australia there is no other type of venomous snakes.
In the Solenoglypha the bite is effected by two movements. The first is the spring of the body, and the second is the grasp by the maxillary bones, which work freely by a ginglymus on the prefrontal bones. The bite as exhibited by a lizard or a mammal, by the closing of the lower jaw on the upper, is of little effect in the Solenoglypha, if it occurs at all, while the movement of the maxillary bones is very conspicuous. I was once nearly bitten by the nearly severed head of a Crotalus molossus, nothing but a piece of skin connecting it with the body, as I was exhibiting the large fangs. A Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii, which I held by the neck on one occasion, opened and closed its fang bearing maxillaries energetically. This may be observed also in other Crotalids when about to bite and unable to reach their enemy. It is quite the reverse with the Proteroglypha. Authors agree that the Hlaps closes the lower jaw, holding its prey in its mouth and piercing it repeatedly with the fangs. The movement of the maxillary, so conspicuous in the Crotalidie, is impossible to these serpents.
The question as to whether the Opisthoglyph serpents are venomous inany degree has been recently discussed. A synopsisof what is known on this subject has been recently published by Dr. L. Stejneger,' of the U.S. National Museum, and from it I ake the following extracts:
It seems that the Dutch professor, Reinwardt, while in Java, was the first to discover that certain snakes, dreaded by the inhabitants of that island as venomous, are provided with long grooved fangs at the posterior end of the maxillary bone. He communicated this discovery to Dr. H. Boie, in Leyden, who published it in 1826.” The suspicion expressed by Professor Reinwardt that this channel or groove on the anterior side of these fangs might convey the fluid from a poison gland led to seyeral important investigations, the first of which to be published was Dr. Hermann Schlegel’s memoir on the salivary glands of the serpents with grooved teeth.*
He came to the conclusion that inasmuch as he found the structure of their glands to be similar to that of other salivary glands, there could be no doubt that they secrete ‘‘a fluid similar to the ordinary saliva;” and as ‘recent observations of travelers” served to show that the bites of snakes with grooved teeth produce no fatal results to man, he asserted with characteristic positiveness that it is ‘‘ erroneous” to
class with venomous serpents those snakes which have the posterior teeth long and channeled. However, a short time after, Prof. G. L. Duvernoy, of Strassburg, pub-

lished a no less important treatise on the subject.!. He pointed to the yellow portion of the supramaxillary gland as being structurally different from the white portion, and from its being connected with a large grooved fang by a single duct he concluded, with equal assurance, that we have here before us a venom apparatus only in degree differing from that of the snakes with poison fangs fixed to the anterior end of the maxillary bone. His results were accepted and introduced into the classification adopted in the monumental herpetological work of Duméril and Bibron, the Erpétologie Générale, in which the snakes with grooved posterior fangs were placed in a separate group as ‘‘ Opistoglyphs.” On the other band, Schlegel, paying no attention whatever to Duvernoy, in his Physiognomie des Serpentes, maintained his standpoint, and so great was the authority of the learned Leyden professor that his view was until quite recently accepted by some of the most prominent systematists. It seems that neither side ever attempted to end the dispute by direct experiments, and gradually the Opistoglyphs to many herpetologists ceased even to be ‘‘suspected.”’
About ten years ago the interest in this question was suddenly revived, and as it may now be fairly regarded as a burning one, some space will be devoted to a short review of several of the recent investigations into this theme.
Two Italian students, M. G. Peracca and C. Deregibus, were led to make special investigations into the possible venomous nature of Malpolon lacertina (—= Calopeltis insignitus), a snake common about Nizza and in parts of Italy. In a communication to the Academy of Medicine at Turin, in May, 1885,° after first describing the grooved fangs, the glands, and the duct leading to the fangs, they recounted their experiences with the snake in question.
Their experiments were carried out with two specimens of Cwlopeltis (— Malpolon), one of medium size, the other much larger; the victims consisted of lizards, frogs, and toads. The snake did not bite them voluntarily; if was necessary to open its mouth and to force the animal into its throat; whereupon the snake inoculated the venom, the motion of the bone carrying the poison fangs being very distinctly seen on account of the manner in which they were standing out from the posterior part of the head. The act of biting lasted some moments, and the snake repeated this act several times without allowing its prey to escape.
The animals were bitten in the hind limb; in the case of the frog the skin had to be removed from the part to be bitten, as the irritating secretion of the skin appeared to be particularly distasteful to the snake. Without reciting the various experiments in detail, the anthors state the more apparent phenomena accompanying them to be (1) the suspension of the respiration, which in the main occurs in avery few minutes (thirteen minutes being the maximum in a toad) and may happen suddenly, or may be preceded by a gradual sinking, interrupted by a deep breathing pause; (2) the cessation of reflex movements in the bitten limb, while still persisting for some time in the rest of the body; the excitements applied below the bitten point ceased almost immediately to be transmitted to the medulla and to show reflexes, This alteration maintained itself local for some time, afterwards progressing toward the periphery along the nerves of the wounded limb. The general paralysis does not delay long in coming. It is but rarely accompanied by conyulsions. The heart continues to beat for a long while (in the toad), but its strength decreases gradually. The blood revealed nothing notable under the spectroscope; as a matter of course it had become venous at the suspension of the respiration. The rapid changes which were observed at the wounded point are noteworthy; the muscular tissue became livid and inexcitable. Death ensued generally in half an hour, or less; in a toad it took place in twenty-six minutes. The heart of a frog continued to beat for many hours after. The authors then call attention tv the interesting sulanity between the above symptoms and those scoompany ing the poisoning by

the cobra de capello, and finally state that they have made controlling experiments with innocuous snakes which did not have such effect upon the animals bitten.
In a subsequent résumé of this article! the same authors add that the effects of the bite of the Malpolon are not to be feared by man. ‘‘It seems,” they say, ‘‘ that the bite is only dangerous to reptiles, birds, and small mammals (mice) ; young dogs have resisted the poison rather well.”
Similar investigations and experiments were carried out about the same time, or a little earlier (1882), on an American species in Guanajuato, Mexico, by Prof. A. Dugés, who has published his notes concerning Trimorphodon biscutatus,? a snake belonging to a genus representatives of which have been found along our southern border. He gives figures of his dissections, showing the venomous gland, with its duct supplying the grooved posterior fangs with the poison. He records his experience as follows:
“‘One day I was admiring the snake. I saw him seize a Cnemidophorus sexlineatus  at the middle of the body, advancing its jaws so as to bring the corner of the mouth in contact with the body of the lizard; for several moments it chewed (a rare occurrence in a snake) its victim without the latter moving, letting go after having killed it; but at this juncture the saurian was swallowed by another snake (Ophibolus doliatus) which was kept in the same cage, thus preventing me from finishing the observation. A few days after, the same Trimorphodon caught another Cnemidophorus by the left arm and chewed it several times. At the end of a few minutes the bitten animal died without convulsions, without agitation, as if asleep, a little blood issuing from the wound.”
A little later (1885), Mr. Otto Edmund LHiffe* published some observations, also made in 1882, on Tarbophis vivax, an opistoglyph snake inhabiting the countries bordering on the Eastern Mediterranean, and from his account we quote as follows:
“‘T offered the half-grown snake a perfectly healthy Lacerta vivipara, which he at once commenced to lap with his tongue and then grasped slowly behind the forelegs. The lizard defended itself as best it could and used its teeth well on the enemy. In less than a minute the lizard was almost motionless, the jaws were powerless, and the eyes closed; before the expiration of another half minute the lizard died, and was then swallowed.”
Prof. Léon Vaillant, of the Museum of Natural History, at Paris, observed the poisonous effect of the bite of another of the opistoglyph snakes, Tragops prasinus, Wagler, and gives the following interesting account of one of the observations: 4
‘‘A small living green lizard was presented to the snake by means of a forceps. The snake seized it across the neck without descending from the shrubbery among which it used to live, and by the play of the jaws drew it back to the corner of the mouth. The lizard tossed and bent about, winding its body and tail round the head of the snake; three minutes later it hangs down inert, only the tail’ still trembling; after a similar space of time convulsions of the whole body occur again, twining itself around the head, then relapsing without motion, except some spasmodic undulations of the tail; this lasts for two minutes, and the animal is dead. It will be seen that this poison must have been tolerably active, as it caused the death of the lizard in about eight minutes after the puncture by the fangs, which must have taken place when the lizard reached the angle of the mouth, as the snake made no movement after that.”
It seems quite plain from these observations that we have here to do with a specific poison. The victims succumbed within a very short time, and while it is evident that death was not caused by the mechanical injury inflicted by the bite, much less by the shock, there is as little room for assuming that it was due to the action of bacteria-infected ordinary saliva.

These experiments have again aroused the interest in the morphology and physiology of these glands, and two years ago, sixty years after Duvernoy’s work, Mr. F.. Niemann published! some investigations upon this subject. Among other snakes he) dissected and described two species with posterior grooved fangs, and he clearly demonstrates that, in both, the yellowish gland has already passed the innocuous stage and become a true poison gland, though structurally somewhat intermediate— as are, in fact, the fangs. He found in both species the yellowish gland well cireumscribed and clearly differentiated from the true supralabial gland, although both glands are contained in the same envelope of connective tissue, and he was able to trace the single duct leading from the yellowish gland to the groove of the posterior elongated fang. One of the species was Tragops prasinus, \WWagler (the same species with which Professor Vaillant experimented), and an inhabitant of the East Indies, the other being Sibon annulatum (Linneus), from tropical America. Fig. 1 is a copy of Mr. Niemann’s schematic representation of the arrangement in the former. Fig. 2 shows a section of the grooved fang near its base, copied from the same author.
That these snakes are not entirely harmless, even to man, is evident from the very recent experience of Mr. J. J. Quelch, of Georgetown, British Guiana,? who was bitten on the first finger by a large specimen of the common red-white-and-blackbanded snake, Hrythrolamprus venustissimus, driving its hinder grooved teeth three times down into the flesh. About half an hour after, the finger became much swollen at the place and distinctly very painful. It was not till about four hours afterward that real relief was obtained, though the place was tender for a much longer time. Another case was that of the clerk in the Museum, who was bitten on the finger by a young specimen of the common frog snake, or Mattipi, Xenodon severus, whose hinder enlarged teeth were driven deeply into the flesh, with a result similar to that described in the case of the other snake.
It will be observed that while the snake by which Mr. Quelch himself was bitten is a true opistoglyph with grooved posterior fangs, the one which caused a similar result in the clerk, viz, the Xenodon, has the enlarged posterior teeth solid and not grooved. I would call attention to the fact, however, that this identical species is: described by Duvernoy® as having the yellowish gland well differentiated. That the bite of the allied species, Xenodon rhabdocephalus, did apparently have no unpleasant effect on Dr. Stradling? is not difficult of explanation in view of the fact that: occasionally the bite of some of even the most dangerous snakes has been inefiective; but enough is said to show that the question is not an unreasonable one: Is iti essential for a truly venomous snake to possess grooved fangs?
As a matter of fact, at the very moment of this sentence going to press, the ques-: tion seems answered conclusively in the negative by the experiments of Phisalix and Bertrand, who have shown that the saliva of even ordinary solid-toothed harmless snakes contains the same specific poison which characterizes the dreaded Thanatophidia.
But four genera of Opisthoglypha enter the political boundaries of the United States, namely, Sibon, Trimorphodon, Coniophanes, and. Tantilla. Of these only the second and fourth ean be properly reckoned. to the Columbian Fauna. .
Snakes are popularly believed to possess a power of “ charming” or attracting to themselves other animals, especially birds, against their will, so that they easily capture them for food. This belief rests on a habit which is usual among the smaller birds, of annoying other ani-

mals which they dislike or fear. Everyone knows how they will congregate about an owl who has not sufficiently concealed itself by daylight, and will make their hostility known by cries and efforts to strike their enemy. So I have witnessed a crowd of birds collected about a black snake, which displayed their hostility by many cries and movements, the snake the while eying them with an inactive interest. Should one of the birds venture too near, I strongly suspect that the snake would take advantage of the opportunity to secure a meal, but this I have not witnessed. I believe, however, that the stories of ‘‘charming” are due to an observation of this not uncommon experience of the field naturalist.
Snakes are for the most part carnivorous; a few forms, as, for example, the genus Herpeton, are more or less herbivorous. They are most effective restrainers of the undue increase of the small Mammalia, and, in the case of the smaller snakes, of the increase of insects, by the destruction of the larve, as well as of the imagines. They are the assured friends of the agriculturist, and as such should be permitted to live and increase. This may be safely done in North America, where there is really but one species of venomous snake not easily distinguished, the Hlaps fulvius, and that is confined to the Gulf border and a small part of that of the southern Atlantic. Some of the large Colubrine snakes, for example, of the genus Compsosoma, are permitted to live in and about the houses of the natives in some parts of South America, and in some localities of western North America the large and harmless Pityophides perform the same function. Allof our species of Colubroidea, however, are of utility to man and should be permitted to live, not only on this account, but also on account of the beauty of their forms and often coloration.
In discussing the breeding habits of certain snakes Prof. O. P. Hay' makes the following remarks:
Notwithstanding the deep impression which serpents have made on the human mind, as shown in literature and in popular conversation, it is astonishing how little accurate information has been accumulated concerning some of their habits. The densest ignorance, the result of inattention and general lack of interest, prevails with regard to some of the most interesting matters connected with the life history of snakes; while, on the other hand, many of the popular notions about the powers of these animals are either wholly false or are gross exaggerations of the truth. The breeding habits of our snakes, even of the most common species, belong among the things about which little is known. Even our biologists have given but little attention to this subject, while unscientific people simply recognize the fact that nests of snakes’ eggs are occasionally met with. For instance, who would not suppose that all the essential facts are known concerning the reproduction of the common black racer Bascanion constrictor? Nevertheless, where have we been told when it lays its eggs, how many there are of them, how they are concealed, and when they hatch?
Some snakes are known to lay eggs which after a period produce young. Other snakes are known to retain the eggs within the body until the young have attained sufficient size and strength to care for themselves after birth. Still other species are supposed sometimes to lay eggs, at other times to bring forth living young,’

or to produce some eggs and some living young at the same time.' There are, indeed, oviparous snakes and snakes which are ovoyviviparous, and there is a conspicuous difference in their eggs. The eggs of the oviparous species are furnished with a thick, tough, flexible covering or ‘‘shell,” while the eggs of the species which produce living young have coverings which are very thin and delicate. Now, should such eggs as the latter be laid any considerable period before the young are ready to be excluded, the thin envelopes would surely be torn during the writhings of the embryo. That some of the eggs may be partially developed at the time when the embryos of other eggs are ready to be ushered into the world, and that all may be expelled together, is possible; but this is not the normal course of things and may not be well for the immature young. Normally the coverings of such eggs are ruptured before birth or immediately afterwards. On the other hand, it is quite probable that the eggs of the oviparous species are laid a considerable period before they are hatched. The tough coverings of such eggs protect them from attacks and injuries from without and at the same time resist the movements of the young snake within. So far as we know these eggs are deposited in the earth in piles of decaying vegetable matter and similar places.
A very curious structure deserves mention here. This is the ‘‘egg-tooth,” a small tooth fixed to the united premaxillary bones and projecting forward slightly beyond the edge of the upper lip. It is present only in the embryo and is shed shortly after the escape of the young snake from the egg. In the ovoviviparous species, the tooth
may apparently be shed before the young are born. The tooth is employed by the little snake in ripping open the tough egg covering in its efforts to escape from its prison. It would appear to be of little service to the young, which are mature when born, since the egg coverings are so very tender; nevertheless I have found the tooth present in all of the ovoviparous species whose young I have had opportunity to study. This tooth, as found in the black racer, was described as long ago as 1857 by Dr. Weinland,? but Miiller had observed it even earlier.
The habits of particular species of snakes are referred to under the respective heads.

It is questionable whether the Aglyphodonta and Glyphodonta should be retained as distinct from each other. Most of the penial characters found in the one occur in the other, and it remains to ascertain whether these, or the grooving or not of the teeth, are to be considered to be of primary importance. For the present I follow the
example of Duméril and Bibron, and Boulenger.

BOID A. Within this family the characters of the hemipenis vary considerably. The plicse are more or less undulate, and in some genera they fuse at intervals, producing pockets which sometimes approach the character of calyces. The sulcus, and generally the entire organ, is bifureate. The plicee may also be represented at the apex by distinct papille. The genera which I have examined present the following characters: I.

The species of the Pythoninz are restricted to the Palotropical, Ethiopian, and Australian realms except those of the single genus Loxocemus Cope, which inhabit Mexico and Central America, within the Neotropie realm.
The only genus of Boinze which is known to enter the boundaries of the Nearctic realm is Lichanura. It is possible that the Boa imperator has been seen in the valley of the Lower Rio Grande, but of this positive evidence is as yet wanting. This species and EHpicrates angulifera of Cuba, and also species of Ungalia are occasionally introduced into the country in bunches of bananas. The serpent windsitself tightly around the stem, and is concealed from view until the fruit is being removed. Unless of large size, these snakes are harmless,

tical. Nostril between two plates, the anterior in contact with that of the opposite side upon the median line. Frontonasal suture extensive. Posterior to these, the upper surface of the head is covered with smooth seales. Labial plates without pits. Scales smooth, broad, poreless. Spurs conspicuous. Gastrosteges narrow.
In this genus the tail is less prehensile than in Boa, but is more so than in Hryx and Charina. It also differs externally from the latter genus (with which Garman at one time proposed to unite it) in the absence of the frontal plate and the parietals adjacent to it. An important osteological difference is the presence of the coronoid bone, which is wanting in Charina.
The species of this genus are variable in their details both as to squamation and coloration. I distinguish three species. Dr. Stejneger has named another, which he subsequently withdrew. In his latest study of this genus this author distinguishes the species as follows: A. Eye large; its diameter more than one-third distance from anterior canthus to
tip of muzzle; gastrosteges about 218. Whitish with three blackish brown longitudinal bands in strong contrast. L. trivirgata. AA. Eye smaller; its diameter one-third or less the distance froin anterior canthus to tip of muzzle; gastrosteges 224 to 241.

Seales of the body in forty to forty-five longitudinal rows, the inferior a little larger than the others. Eight to ten scales in the ocular ring; superior la dials fourteen or fifteen, the anterior three highest. Loreals, three supericr vertical, two inferior horizontal. Rostral plates slightly prominent, ele vated, recurved, quinquelateral, its labial border as long as its nasal. Inerior labials fifteen, the anterior five longest. A short mental fissure.
General color pale yellowish, tinged with brown. The belly and flanks are irregularly specked with liver brown. Superiorly there extend from the muzzle to the end of the tail three deep liver brown bands, the median four and the two lateral, five scales wide, separated by intervals three and a half scales in width.
The coloration of this handsome boa is altogether unique in the family. It calls to mind the Salvadora of the sameregion. It inhabits the southern region of Lower California, where Mr. J. Xantus has

This species is represented by a specimen (Cat. No. 14129) from San Diego, California. The color above, as far as the fifth row of scales on each side, is a brownish lead color; below this line and on the lower surface, light lead-color with dark lead-colored borders to some of the scales, and a wide lead-colored basal shade of the gastrosteges and urosteges. There are three longitudinal rusty-brown bands on the dorsal region, which are indistinetly defined and of irregular width.

It was on a specimen of this variety from the same locality that I proposed the species Lichanura myriolepis. It has forty-five rows of scales. Another specimen from San Diego is described by Dr. Stejneger as a distinct species under the name of L. simpler.

Dr. Stejneger thus describes this species, which is the form most distinct from the L. trivirgata:
Seales in thirty-three to thirty-five rows; eye encircled by nine or ten scales; loreals four; labials thirteen to fifteen; gastrosteges, two hundred and thirty-two; anal entire; urosteges forty-five, entire.
Rostral plate very prominent, recurved, pentagonal, its nasal border twice as long as its labial; eye surrounded by aring of scales of nearly equal size, ten on the right side, but only nine on the left; between the posterior nasal and the middle preocular two large loreal scales, and under the posterior one, wedged in between it, the middle and lower prefrontals, and fourth, fifth, and sixth supralabials, a somewhat smaller subloreal; over the posterior loreal a superloreal of medium size; nasal divided, the anterior plate meeting the one of the other side; back of these a pair of rather large anterior prefrontals followed by foursmaller posterior prefrontals, or what corresponds to these plates where a frontal exists, the outer ones being larger than those in the middle; posterior to these the head is covered with numerous rather irregular scales; supralabials thirteen, the first four highest; infralabials fifteen, gradually diminishing in height from the pair joining the triangular mental; mental fissure separating four pairs of scales; scales of body smooth, in thirtythree to thirty-five longitudinal rows, the inferior on each side slightly larger than the rest; gastrosteges narrow, two hundred and thirty-two; anal small, entire; tail short, blunt; urosteges forty-five, entire.

Dimensions.—Total length, 870 mm.; length of tail from anus, 110 mm.; diameter of eye, 3mm.; from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 11 mm.; proportion of last two measurements =—1: 3.7.
Coloration.—Ground color light bluish gray, with a light brownish wash on the upper surface; three longitudinal ill-defined, zigzag bands of a pale raw umber brown running the whole length of the body, the middle one starting between the eyes running to the end of the tail, the lateral ones starting on the temporal region becoming obscure on the tail; top of muzzle and occasional blotches between the bands of the same color; whole underside, except the gulars, mottled irregularly with blotches of a dark neutral tint.
Of the forms which compose this genus the present species appears to be the most highly differentiated, the most distinctive feature being the elongation of the snout ani the prominence and shape of the rostral. From the L. trivirgata, myriolepis, and simplex group, it differs more particularly by the low number of scale rows and loreals.

In Charina the sulcus of the hemipenis is bifurcate, but the organ is simple. The surface is plicate, the plice distant toward the apex, and the apex smooth.
But one genus of this family is known.

Muzzle rather elongate; extremity depressed, rostral plate reflected backward above, but not separating internasals. These are about equal in dimensions to each of the two pairs of the prefrontals, and like them are not separated from each other by scales on the median line. The frontal would be a semicircle were it not that the anterior border presents a very obtuse angle forward. This border is continuous with the anterior border of the superciliary, which is not the case in the C. bottw. The posterior prefrontal passes in front of the single superciliary, and its postero-external border occupies more of the border of the orbit than does the preocular below it. The parietal is a semicircular band,and it is followed immediately by the usual type of scales. The anterior prefrontals rest at their extremities equally on the preocular and the postnasal. The former is trapezoidal, and is about as high as long; the latter is a little longer than high. The prenasal is very small. Superior labials eight on one side and nine on the other; the eye resting on the third, fourth, and fifth on one side, and on the same plus the sixth on the other. Two postoculars. Three or four pairs of geneials of about the same size as the gular scales. Seales of the body in forty-five rows. Tail short obtuse, with a dermal cap-scale.

The single small specimen described above stands quite outside the wide range of variation of the C. bottw, presenting characters which might be and have been considered to be of generic importance. The separation of the prenasal, and absence of the loreal plates can not, however, be so used in this group in my opinion.

None of the North American specimens have the internasals separated on the middle line by a seale, as is stated to be the case in the type of C. bottw by Bocourt. Several have the prefrontals separated by scales, however, so that the character of the type specimen is probably only an individual variation. There is no reason to suppose that the Upper California species differs from that of Lower California. I give the following notes, which I took from Blainville’s type in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes in 1864, by permission of Prof. Auguste Dumeril:
The tail enters the total length 94 times. Frontal much wider than long, postnasal and loreal longer than wide. One preocular. Ten superior labials, second and third touching loreal, fourth, fifth, and sixth entering orbit. Forty-three rows of scales, size graduating smaller from first to third. A reddish tintin the pale brown of the belly; above slaty brown.
The specimen agreed in size and characters with the one described by Blainville, and I am therefore at a loss to understand the accounts given by Jones and Bocourt. The former says! there are but thirty-

<<<Page: 755>>>

nine rows of scales on the body, and the latter says, perhaps by a typographical error, twenty-nine. Bocourt also says that at the period of his writing,' 1882, the specimen was no longer in good condition. It was in good condition at the time of my examination in 1864.
The Wenona isabella does not appear to me to differ specifically from the other forms. Its head plates display a peculiarity which is also seen in a specimen from California. (See table, pages 728, 729.)

was very tame and allowed itself to be handled to any extent without
attempting to bite. A specimen in the U.S. National Museum contains
a small mammal which it had eaten. Another individual was in the act of swallowing a Sceloporus when captured and preserved in spirits.

In Ungalia there are no plice, and in U. melanura there are only four small papillwe systematically arranged. The sulcus and organ are furcate.

I have been unable to determine the penial structure of the only species of the Xenopeltide, thé Yenopeltis unicolor Reinwardt, as all of the four individuals accessible to me are females.
There are two subfamilies of this family:

(ery REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898.
But three species constitute this family, Xenodermus javanicus Reinwardt, from the Malaysian Archipelago; the Nothopsis rugosus
Cope,! from the Darien region of New Grenada, and Stoliczkaia khasi_
ensis Jerdon, from S. India. COLUBRID.
The natural divisions of this family are clearly indicated by the characters of the hemipenis for the greater part. The characters of the vertebrie can not, however, be neglected, and the dentition in a general
way corresponds with ‘the results thus attained. Thus the type of.
penis with simple sulcus and well-developed raches includes the large isodont ground snakes and their allies. The types with furcate suleus with ruches or disc, are nearly always diacranterian in dentition. The Natricine hemipenis is always associated with continued vertebral hypapophyses. The smooth or plicate hemipenis is very seldom associated with such hypapophyses. .
I repeat here in the main the groups indicated in my prodomous of 1893, with the omission of the glyphodont genera. As I have not had access to some of the Oriental and African genera, it may be necessary to introduce some changes into some of the groups which include those genera. I also now regard the disciferous type as of equal value with the others. -

By far the greater number of snakes belong to the family Colubride. They represent all types of relation to the environment; for seme are aquatic, and others are terrestrial, some living on the surface of the earth and others burrowing beneath it. Others are more or less arboreal, some ascending to the summits of the tallest trees of the forest, and rarely descending to the earth. None of them are dangerous to man, excepting that some of the larger species could cause the death of children by constricting the neck so as to cause suffocation; but this accident rarely occurs. Most of the species disappear at the sight of man. ;

In this group Lystrophis has a close external resemblance to Heterodon, but the recurved rostral plate occurs also in the Scytaline genus Rhinostoma, which has no relationship to either. I formerly referred the Dromicine forms to this subfamily.

Any one familiar with these genera will perceive that they are not represented in a iinear series in the table. He will also observe that genera of probably not very close affinities are placed close together, as, for instance, Tretanorhinus and Helicops and their associates. This is, however, a necessity of an artificial key and is not new in zoology.
The species of this subfamily are all American, and mostly neotropical. The following genera are found in the Medicolumbian fauna: Carphophiops, Abastor, Farancia, Diadophis, Rhadinea, Heterodon. Of these, all are characteristically nearctic except Rhadinea, which is neotropical. Of the remaining genera Hypsirhynchus and Neomacer have been only found on the island of Santo Domingo, while Adromicus and Halsophis are principally if not entirely West Indian. Amastridium, Pliocercus, and Ninia are Central American and Columbian, while Tretanorhinus is the only genus which belongs both to this region and to the West Indian. Helicops is confined to the Brazilian district, where it is represented by a number of species.
The fusiform types are Pseudoeryx, Rabidosoma, Carphophiops, Abastor, and Farancia. The rest are more or less colubriform, except Uromacer, which is very slender, including only tree snakes.

This genus is the North American representative of the neotropical Rhabdosoma and the typical forest burrowers. The species are generally found under stones, and under and in rotten logs, and under the bark, where they readily make their way, forcing their sharp muzzle into narrow places with much muscular strength.
Carphophiops has exactly the plate and scale formula of Abastor, but the hemipenis is simple and not bifurcate. It resembles that of A bastor, however, in having the suleus bifurcate, and the apex furnished with calyces in moderate number.
The two species of the genus differ as follows:

Dorsal seales in thirteen rows. Head small; frontal plate hexagonal, nearly as broad as long. Internasals angular, one-third the size of prefrontals, which are likewise angular, and enter posteriorly into the upper portion of the orbit in front. Parietals proportionally large. Rostral broad and well developed. Nasal single, nostril in the middle of the anterior half. A large loreal forming with the prefrontal the anterior part of the orbit. A quadrangular and elevated postorbital. Superciliaries very small and narrow. Snout protruding. Eyes cireular, over the commissure of the third and fourth labial. Upper labials five, fifth largest. Inferior labial six, third largest. Temporal shields well developed, two in the vertical row behind the first temporal and last upper labial.
Body very glossy, subeylindrical. Tail short, tapering into a point. Seales rhomboidal, broad, all perfectly smooth. Outer row somewhat larger.
Above uniform chestnut-brown, opalescent; bright salmon color in life beneath.
In nearly half the specimens the internasal scuta are wanting. This condition was supposed by Kennicott to indicate a distinct species

<<<Page: 761>>>

(C. helene Kennicott), and by some others a distinct genus.
There is,
however, no other character by which to separate it from the C. anenus,
and the character itself is not constant.
Thus, in jar Cat. No. 8840, from
Union County, Tennessee, one specimen has both internasals, a second

< 2.4.
Mount Carmel, Illinois. Cat. No. 12046, U.S.N.M.
has but one, and a third is without. In jar Cat. No. 12046, from Mount Carmel, Illinois, nearly all the specimens lack the internasals, but one of them has the plate on one side. Some other variations ,occur. Thus, in a specimen from Jackson, North Carolina (Cat. No. 1921), the anterior angle of the frontal plate is produced forward to the internasals, completely separating the prefrontals. In Cat. No. 10721, from Washington, District of Columbia, there is but one, a large scute, in the second row of temporals; and two rows of scales are of the color of the abdomen, which contrasts strongly with thatof the dorsalregions. The
specimen is quite intermediate between this species and the C. vermis. In some specimens the superciliary is larger than the postocular; in _ others the reverse is the case.

This species always possesses the internasal plates, so far as our knowledge extends. The posterior geneials are always distinct, though
smaller than the anterior. The distribution of the species is in the southwestern part of the Kast-

Head subconical, continuous with the body. Cephalic plates normal. One nasal, grooved beneath the nostril. No anteorbitals. One loreal together with the prefrontals constituting the orbit anteriorly. Teeth equal. Pupil cireular: Scales smooth. Postabdominal scutella bifid. Subcaudal all bifid. Hemipenis bifurcate, each apex with a moderate number of slightly serrate calyces. Spines numerous.
The penial characters of this genus show that it belongs to the Dromicine, near to Carphophiops, as I already suggested in 1895,' The bifurcation of the organ distinguishes it from that genus. It resembles that of Farancia in all essentials, the smaller and more numerous spines offering no greater difference than that which occurs in various genera,
This genus is represented by a single species, which inhabits the southern part of the Nearctic region. It is thus characterized :
Scales in 19 rows; superior labials, 7; tail one-seventh of total length or shorter, bluish black, with 3 red stripes above; below, flesh-colored, with a series of bluish-black spots on each side ....-...----..---------------A. erythrogrammus,

‘This species is a burrower, and is allied to Carphophiops, as I first pointed out. The Pamunkey River specimens were dug from a clay bank beneath ten feet of sand. Mr. Clarence B. Moore, in his excavations of Indian mounds in Florida, has dug it from nearly as great a depth beneath the surface, in sand. This species and the Farancia abacura are the largest of the burrowing Dromicine.

DIADOPHIS Baird and Girard.
Diadophis BairpD and GIRARD, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serpents, 1853, p. 112.— Cork, Bull. U. 8. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, pp. 54-80.
Head normal, distinct from body. Teeth of maxillary bone subequal andinan uninterrupted series. Palatine teeth present. Cephalic plates normal; rostral normal; two nasals; one loreal. Scales smooth, unifossate. Anal plate and subcaudal scuta divided, Hemipenis simple, with humerous simple calyces and numerous spines.
Diadophis is allied to Dromicus, but in that genus the last superior maxillary tooth is longer and follows a toothless space, the scales are pitless, and the hemipenis is bifurcate. Rhadinewa agrees with Diadophis in dentition, but tas no scale pits, as in Dromicus, and the hemipenis is capitate. Both of these genera are neotropical in distribution. The species of Diadophis are North American in distribution, except one from the Bahama Islands. It is, however, not unlikely that other species will be referred to this genus when the characters of their scale pits shall be known.
The North American species of Diadophis are difficult to define, owing to their variability. If exceptions to definitions were to be chiefly considered, all might be regarded as one species. They are easily seen to have been of common origin at no very remote period. The number of labial scuta is variable in all of the forms; the number of rows of scales is much less so. The width of the yellow neck collar is very variable; in the D. regalis it may be present or absent. The distribution of the spots on the belly, whether regular or irregular, coincides with other character quite closely, but the absence of the median Series from the form with three rows is of no significance. The light or dark color of the dorsal region characterizes geographical varieties of each of the three North American species. The species are charac terized as follows:

DIADOPHIS AMABILIS AMABILIS Baird and Girard.
Diadophis amabilis BARD and GIRARD, Cat. N. A. Rept., 1853, p. 115. The following description is that of Baird and Girard, taken from the typical specimens:
Color above blackish brown down to the gastrosteges.
Head, body, and tail very slender; head flattened above; body subcylindrical; tail subconical and tapering into a point. Vertical plate subpentagonal, less tapering posteriorly than in D. punctatus, and subacute. Occipitals narrow and elongated. Frontals as in D). punctatus. Superciliaries narrower and nearly of the same width throughout their length. Upper labials, seven; sixth largest. Lower labials, eight; fifth largest. Scales rather short, subelliptical, considerably larger on the sides than on the back, es-

Two specimens from Fresno, California, have the superior labials brown with darker brown spots, and may represent this form. They areof darker color above than either the D. a. docilis or D. a. pulchellus, resembling the D. punctatus. This color is, however, only present on the apex of the scales of the first row in one specimen, and on the apices of those of the first and second on the other, thus approaching the D. a. pulchellus. The abdominal spots are large, numerous, and irregular.

The regular arrangement of the abdominal spots in three rows approximates this form to the D. punctatus. In fact, it only differs from it in the possession of but seven labial plates, and a speckled lower labial and gular region. As occasional specimens of D. punctatus are found with only seven superior labials, the approximation is close.
The number of rows of scales is fifteen; the superior labials are seven, eye resting on third and fourth, aS is sometimes the case in punctatus. Color above light brownish olive, a

Cat. No. 2067, from Santa Magdalena, is intermediate between this form and the C. amabilis puchellus. The inferior row of scales is colored like the ground of the abdomen, which has rather numerous, irregular, dark spots. The color of the upper surfaces is like that of D. a. pulchellus, and the lips and throat are sparsely spotted.

RHADIN AA Cope.
Rhadinea Corr, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1868, p. 182; Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1886, p.487; Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 138.—BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., II, 1894, p. 160.
Posterior maxillary teeth little longer, or not longer than the anterior; hemipenis undivided, with more or less papillose calyces at the apex, the whole calyculate surface presenting a free margin (capitate), from below which the spines issue. Cephalic plates normal; two nasals and one loreal. Postabdominal and caudal scuta divided. Scales smooth, poreless; colubriform.
This genus is represented throughout Mexico and Central America by numerous species, and perhaps in South America, but the penial characters of the species of the latter region referred to it are unkrown. None of themare of large size, and they frequently display ornamental colors. The type is R. obtusa Cope.
A single species enters the United States, which has been found so far only in the southeastern part of our country.
Some of the species of Rhadinea have a pseudopreocular plate, a character which I find generally constant. The division of the large preocular is, on the contrary, inconstant.
Boulenger has referred to this genus the species placed by Duméril and Bibron in the genus Liophis. These must be omitted, as I have shown that they possess the penial characters of the Xenodontine. The following synopsis includes all the species which I suppose to belong to the genus so far as known:

These snakes are of feeble organization and small to medium size. They usually display brilliant colors, which are soon lost in alcohol.

The following description is copied from Giinther, as no specimen has come into my hands:
Scales smooth, in seventeen rows, many with a small apical groove. Form of the head as in Coronella levis; body and tail moderately slender. Eye of moderate size; the rostral does not extend to the upper surfaces of the head; anterior frontals searcely half as large as posterior; vertical longer than the snout, but shorter than the occipitals, which are rounded behind; loreal square; one preorbital, reaching to the upper surface of the head, but not extending on to the vertical; two postoculars; seven upper labials, the third and fourth entering the orbit; temporals 1+2--3, the anterior in contact with both postoculars; two pairs of chin-shields, nearly equal in length; ventrals 163; anal bifid; subcaudals 95.
A lead-colored band, three scales broad, runs from the nape, along the median line of the back, to the end of the tail; flanks reddish, with a very indistinct grayish streak along the fourth outer series of scales; two yellow lines across the rostral, the lower runs along the upper labials and across the neck, thus entirely encircling the head; the upper runs along the canthus rostralis, and stops or terminates in the temporal region. Lower parts uniform yellowish.
One specimen was in a collection made by Dr. Doorman, in the neighborhood of the City of Mexico. It 1s 21 inches long; head 6 lines; tail 7 inches.

<<<Page: 781>>>

The dentition of this species is neither distinctly diacranterian nor syncranterian. The maxillary is armed with nine teeth, gradually becoming stronger, longer, and more widely set behind; the last is conspicuously the longest, but scarcely more distant from the penultimate than this is from the antepenultimate, although these three teeth are much more distant than the others are from each other.
RHADINZA FULVIVITTIS Cope.
Rhadinea fulvivittis Corr, Journ. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 139. _
Head small, not very distinct from body. Frontal a little longer than the suture from it to the nasal, and a little shorter than common suture of occipitals, two-thirds as wideaslong. Kostral small, low; postnasal higher than long; loreal as high as long. Superior Jabials eight, seventh highest; temporals 1-1. Inferior labials ten, sixth largest, in contact with middle of post geneials. Scales poreless. Gastrosteges one hundred and seventy-seven; anal divided; urosteges ninety-one.
Color above fulvous, below fulvous yellow. The three brown bands extend from the end of the nose to near the end of the tail; the lateral involves the fourth and the half of each adjacent row of scales, and is black edged; the dorsal is three and two half scales wide and is also black edged. The brown is paler on top of the head and the ground color is a narrow, yellow band to the eye. Lips yellow, like the lower surfaces, unspotted.
This species is allied to the R. vittata Jan, with which Boulenger unites it. The absence of the pseudopreocular, and the short loreal plate, do not agree with the specimens of the latter.

The following description I have copied from Peters, as covering the characters of the species thoroughly:

muzzle; postnasal higher than prenasal shield; frenal much longer than high; parietals about half as much longer as the median frontal, which is about the length of the muzzle. Supralabials eight, of which the fourth and fifth are in contact with the eye; one anteorbital, two postorbitals, which are in contact with an elongate temporal; two pairs of submentalia, of which the hindmost is perceptibly the longest; ten infralabials, of which six are in contact with the submentals; gastrosteges one hundred and fifty-five, one divided anal and one hundred and eight divided urosteges, or 172 + + + 91.
Groind color brown. A broad longitudinal dark brown or black line covers the three median dorsal rows and the half of each of the external rows in contact with them, or, it is composed of three separate longitudinal stripes, of which the median is bordered on either side by a series of small, oblique streaks on the external border of the median row of scales and the inner edges of the scales of the rows bordering it on either side; on each side and continuous with the transverse rostral band, a lateral, longitudinal black stripe passing through the eye to the end of the tail, which is separated from the median dorsal line by two half, or one and two half scales, the line itself two half scales wide, or descending to the third lateral row and embracing two entire and almost two half rows. The brownish-yellow stripe which separates the dorsal from the lateral stripes begins at the muzzle, interrupted by the eye and passes backward along the external border of the parietals. Posteriorly on the external ends of the ventrals there is a black point, which form lateral punctated lines on the anterior ventral side. Dirty yellow ventrally and on the supralabials.
Behind a series of shorter and nearly isodont teeth, separated by a diastema, there follows a longer smooth tooth.
Total length, 505 mm.; head, 16 mm.; tail, 177 mm.; width of head, 85 mm.; width of body, 9 mm.; in another specimen: Total length, 325 mm.; head, 12 mm.; tail, 91 mm.
The specimens which have come under my observation have been of the color variety in which the median brown dorsal band is represented by three narrow stripes, of which the median is the narrowest. One of these came from the State of Puebla and the two others from Zacualtipan (Hidalgo) from Dr.S. Bernard. It was on these that I proposed the name R. quinquelineata.
According to Giinther this species is common in the high lands of Guerrero, and Boulenger gives it from Jalisco and the City of Mexico. All of these localities are at an elevation of 8,000 feet or more. Dugés gives Guadalajara.
From the stomach of a specimen from Zacualtipan I took an adult Spelerpes leprosus.

It is dark brown, bordered above. Head above light brown, with two yellow brown-bordered parietal spots such as are usually present in water snakes. Measurements.—Total length, 385 mm.; tail, 99 mm. This species approaches equaily several species, but differs from all others. It combines a long body and short tail, with large and few “inferior labials, as in R. fulviceps, which is a long-tailed species, with a. different coloration.

This is a snake of rather feeble character. I observed a specimen from Fort Macon, North Carolina, which I owed to my friend, Dr. H.C. Yarrow, for several months in confinement. It was rather inactive.
The Rhadinea flavilata has been found along the southern Atlantic coast region from southern North Carolina to southern Florida. It is more common in the latter region than elsewhere.

Dentition fliacranterian. Caudal scutella divided; anal plate double. Rostral plate recurved, with transverse upturned edge and flat anteroinferior face. The nine cephalic plates, a loreal, two nasals and ocular plates present, with one or more supplemental behind the rostral. Seales keeled, bifossate. Pupil round. Form robust. Hemipenis bifurcate, the apices with numerous papillose calyces, and separated by a free margin from the spinous portion. Spines numerous, hooked. An enormous diverticulum of the left lung extendimg to the throat.
The few species of this genus which are known agree also in having a series of scales separating the eye from the superior labial plates, and in having an azygous plate behind the rostral. The postero-superior aspect of the rostral plate has a keel on the middle line, and there are from three to five, generally four, scales in the first temporal row. The tail is short. The anterior ribs are capable of extension so as to flatten that part of the body, as is done by the cobras of the genus Naja, but the expansion is not so wide, and it has greater longitudinal extent. The postgeneial plates are reduced to a very small size, and are separated from each other by small scales.
The species of this genus range throughout North America excepting the Pacific region. They do not extend far into the Sonoran, and are absent from the Lower Californian and the Mexican regions. They

<<<Page: 786>>>

have no representatives in equatorial America or the West Indies. A genus Lystrophis Cope’, is found in subtropical and temperate South America, which resembles Heterodon superficially, but belongs to the Xenodontide. A genus occurs in Madagascar (Anomalodon Jan) which agrees superficially with Lystrophis, but differs in having an entire anal shield, but belongs by the penial characters to the Lycodontine.
The species of Heterodon have some peculiar habits which indicate greater intelligence than most other snakes possess. They throw themselves into remarkable contortions when alarmed, and expand their anterior ribs, inflate their lung, and open the mouth widely. They do not attempt to bite from the ground, but the long posterior maxillary tooth may be used with considerable effect if the snake is carelessly handled. The trowel-shaped rostral plate enables them to excavate sand with ease, and in such soil they are usually most abundant.
Three species of this genus may be distinguished as follows:
I. No accessory seales about the azygous plate.
Scales in 25 rows; rostral plate less developed; larger. .----..--H. platyrhinus. II. Accessory scales about the azygous scuta.,

The H. platyrhinus ranges throughout the Eastern and Austroriparian regions, and the H. simus inhabits the Austroriparian only. The H. nasicus is divided into two subspecies, one of which extends over the Central and the other over the Sonoran regions.

<<<Page: 788>>>

anterior to the middle of the chord connecting the apex of rostral and posterior end of labials and over the middle of the fifth labial. Outline of upper jaw convex. Lower labials, eleven.
Body stout and short. Tail very short, and rapidly tapering, rather thicker than the thinnest part of the body. Dorsal rows twenty-five. Seales all distinctly carinated (including those on the back of the head), except the outer two or three rows, which are either perfectly smooth, or present very obsolete carination.
Color reddish brown above, with dark blotches. A series of twentyeight quadrate, dorsal, uniform black blotches from head to anus, each from two to three scales long, and seven to nine wide, separated by regular brownish-yellow intervals of one and one-half to two scales. The blotches anteriorly are nearly square, posteriorly they are transversely elongated. Opposite the intervals, and, indeed, bounding them on either side, is a second series of small cirewar blotches on the fourth to the eighth lateral rows, and separated only by a narrow interval from the corner of the dorsal blotches. Sometimes there are faint traces of small blotches between the upper lateral series. Intervals between the lateral rows of blotches yellowish or reddish brown, darker than those on the back; outer dorsal rows greenish or yellowish white. On the tail there are fifteen black half rings, interrupted on the subcaudal scutellz, the scales on the tail larger than on the greater part of the body. In young specimens there is distinctly visible a second series of still smaller blotches, below the one just mentioned, there being two of these opposite each one of the former, and placed on the second, third, and fourth exterior rows. Beneath greenish yellow, with obsolete greenish-brown blotches, indistinctly visible through the epidermis, Sometimes more conspicuous in young specimens.
There is a transverse black or dark bar on the forehead, crossing the posterior half of the postfrontals, involving only the anterior edge of the vertical, and the anterior corners of the superciliaries. Behind this a dark patch, with its anterior margin a little back of the middle of the vertical, and involving the adjoining margin of the superciliaries and occipitals, together with the greater portion of the occipitals; sometimes with a light spot in the middle; the light space included between the two patches appears to extend continuously backward to ° the neck; above, a dark vitta from the back part of the orbit to the posterior labial, itself a continuation of the frontal vitta. An elongated harrow vertebral spot behind the junction of the occipitals, and gencraily isolated from them, on each side of which is a similar patch widening behind.
This species is subject to great variations of color. Sometimes the sides of the dorsal blotches pass insensibly into the ground color, so as to become transverse bands. At others they are light internally, with anarrow margin of black. Occasionally there is much black on the abdomen (in young specimens). The ground color varies from gray to

<<<Page: 789>>>

bright yellow, and sometimes even red. It may also happen that, by the confluence and extension of the darker margins, we have light bars on a dark ground, as on a specimen from the Scioto Valley, Ohio, where, with the other characters similar, the color is of a dark brown above and on the sides, with transversely quadrate brownish ash-colored spots along the back, some one and a half or two scales long, nine or ten wide, and at intervals of about three scales. Of these spots there are twenty-eight from head to anus, and about nine on the tail,
where they form half
‘little larger than them-
selves. About forty specimens display the normal col\ oration. In eleven the N lateral spots of the first ps row join the spots of the “y \ median row, inclosing sees the light intervening INNA dorsal spaces as spots. US In four other specimens
this fusion is imperfect. The light spots have acquired so dark a shade as to have disappeared in the black color variety, called by Dr. Holbrook Heterodon niger. Among numerous specimens of this torm in the national collection there are two (Cat. Nos. 1168 and 9105) in which traces of the usual spots remain.
One specimen of this form is a true lead color, with a black band extending posterior to the orbit (Cat. No. 16489),
The specimens on which Baird and Girard proposed the name Heterodon atmoides difter from the normal form in a less production of the free acute edge of the rostral plate. No other character reenforces this peculiarity, and it intergrades with the usual type. It can be looked upon only as an individual characteristic. Individuals of this kind are more frequently sent from the eastern part of the Austroriparian region than elsewhere.
The specimen on which the H. cognatus (Cat. No. 1271; Indianola, Texas) was proposed by Baird and Girard is lighter colored than usual, but not otherwise different, except in the possession of only two temporals in the first row on each side. The absence of the small superior temporal is not by itself indicative of important diversity.

I find the caudal scutelle to vary in number from thirty-nine to fiftytwo in nine normally colored specimens, and from forty-two to fifty-six in five black specimens.
The Heterodon platyrhinus, when disturbed by man, throws itself into vigorous contortions, spreads the anterior ribs, and opens the mouth widely, after the manner of a venomous snake. If turned on its back and its abdomen be gently stroked, it will sometimes lie quietly in that position for a long time. I once observed the singular conduct of an individual which was kept in a cage with a water snake (Natrix sipedon) and a copperhead (Ancistrodon contortrix). Both of the harmless species were evidently greatly frightened on the introduction of the copperhead into the cage. The water snake sought the lowest spot in the sand on the bottom of the cage, and coiling up, kept close to the ground, not even raising his head. The Heterodon, on the contrary, inflated his long lung, swelling the greater part of his body into the form of a cylindrical bladder. He at the same time extended the anterior ribs, so that this part of his body resembled the thin blade of a paper cutter. He then plunged its nose into the sand and covered the top of his head with as large a pile of that substance as it would carry. In this disfigured condition he paraded slowly about the cage in front of the copperhead. The latter moved but little, and showed no disposition to provoke a quarrel with its singular companion.
Prof. O. P. Hay” has collected the following facts in regard to the breeding habits of Heterodon platyrhinus, the hog-nosed snake, viper, or spreading adder, as it is popularly known:
Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel, Illinois, reports*® that eighty-seven young spotted spreading adders were taken from the body of a wounded female. The author of the
1 Heterodon niger. 2Proc. Ind. Acad. Sci., 1891, p. 114; Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., XV, 1892, p. 393. 3 Amer. Nat., XVI, 1882, p. 1008.

<<<Page: 791>>>

note did not see this done, but got his information from persons who did seeit. I am strongly inclined to believe that the reptile was a Tropidonotus sipedon. Another
writer! in Pennsylvania gives an account of over one hundred young snakes issuing *
from a wound in the side of a female spreading adder. These young were each from 6 to 8 inches in length and all were active and blowing vigorously. Neither did the author of this note see the escape of the snakes, although he did see sixty-three of the young in alcohol. There may easily have been an error in the determination of the species to which these young snakes belonged. One who has examined the eggs of this species can not easily believe that so many young snakes could, with such readiness, escape from a wound in the mother’s side. Moreover, these snakes deposit their eggs in the earth some time before the young are ready to lead an independent existence.
Dr. Bumpus? states that a female Heterodon in the National Museum brought forth 111 young, but Dr. Bumpus informs me that he did not himself observe this.
Prof. F. W. Cragin reports® the finding, on September 10, of 22 eggs of this species; they were buried in the sand at East Hampton, Long Island. Two of the eggs which he had in his possession hatched four days afterwards. ‘Troost appears to have dissected a black specimen, in which he found 25 eggs. Dr. C. C. Abbott says‘ that he has frequently in May found the eggs of the hog-nosed snake in considerable numbers a few inches below the surface of the ground, and in early July he once found a family of 17 very small and apparently just hatched young. These resented all interference, snapped, hissed, and flattened their heads precisely as an older snake would do. The size of the young is not given, but on another page (p. 295) he implies that they were less than 4 inches in length. I think that this species, like most other species, produce their young rather late in the season, but I see no reason for not believing that some individuals may bear their eggs over the winter and lay them in the spring.
A female (Cat.No, 17951, U.S.N.M. ), sent me from Veedersburg, Fountain County, Indiana, contained 15 eggs, the posterior 4 of which lay in the left oviduct. I could discover no signs of embryos. Each egg was covered by a thick, tough, yellowish coat, inside of which was a thinner and more delicate membrane.
Through the kindness of Dr. L. Stejneger, curator of the department of reptiles in the National Museum, I have been enabled to make some observations on the eggs and living young of this Heterodon. On the 31st day of last August there were brought into the laboratory of the department from some point in Maryland not far from Washington a lot of 27 eggs, which the finder said were the eggs of the copperhead. Itwas reported that the eggs were thrown up out of the ground by the plow, and that the mother snake was near by and had resented the disturbing of her treasures. She had been killed, but had not been sent along with the eggs. Since it was supposed that the copperhead produces living young, the occupants of the laboratory were anxious to learn if this opinion were erroneous. Accordingly one of the eggs was opened, and in it was found a young hog-nosed snake, fully developed and ready to assist himself on thescene of action. This Heterodon quite closely sesembles the copperhead, and most people are not accustomed to make nice distinctions amoug snakes, This close resemblance may account for some of the statements of the large number of young produced by the copperheads.*
The eggs referred to were between 1} and 1} inches long and about seven-eighths inch in short diameter. The egg covering was thick, tough, and flexible, resembling a piece of parchment. There is little if any deposit of lime in it. Of these eggs, some were found to have hatched during the night of September 6; others, which were buried somewhat deeper in some clay, escaped from the eggs later, but all were out by the afternoon of the 8th. The length of such as were measured varied

CROCODILIANS, LIZARDS, AND SNAKES. 767 between 7 and 8 inches. From the moment of escape from the egg all were quite active, and manifested many of the characteristics of the adults. Some of the little fellows were quite saucy, and would make a pretense of striking at the approaching finger, but their efforts in that line were rather feeble. A faint hiss was sometimes uttered, but that may not have been voluntary. One would sometimes flatten its head and body and rear up with the anterior third of its length free from the ground. If one did not know well their inoffensive natures, one would be excused for fearing to handle them. An extremely singular habit possessed by the adults is that of feigning death. On being struck or teased, they will roll over and over, as if in the intensest agony, and then throw themselves on the back, and lie there as if dead. Out of some fifteen of the young experimented with, I succeeded in getting only two or three to go through with this performance, but these did it to perfection. On being lightly struck a few times, they would turn over on the back, writhe about a while, and then lie perfectly still. If turned right side up they would again turn on the back. If left undisturbed for a little while they would turn over and creep slyly away. The others of the young would not act in this way, however much they were teased. It would be interesting to know whether all the adults possess this odd habit, or only a portion of them.
The cuticle of the young Heterodons is shed very shortly after their escape from the egg coverings. Within a few minutes after one had left its prison the skin was observed to be broken about its head. It had left the egg at half past 1 and by 4 o’clock the skin was pushed back half the length of the body. The next morning the skin was wholly shed, revealing the brighter colors of thenewskin. While getting rid of the cuticle the little fellow kept crawling over the clay and among the roots of the grass.
The opportunity was embraced to observe the use which is made of the egg tooth. The tooth itself is easily seen in the just hatched snake. Its lateral borders are more nearly parallel than those of the tooth of Bascanion figured by Weinland. Seen from the side, the anterior or upper outline is concave, the posterior outline convex. Thus the tooth projects forward and is slightly turned up. The anterior face is also concave from side to side, so that there is, on each side, a distinct cutting edge. The tip is cut off square. The tooth appears to have a ligamentous attachment, and may be lifted a little, but not much depressed. It seems quite evident that the tooth is first engaged in the egg covering, and then made to do its work by a forward push of the head. An examination of the covering, after the snake had left it, gives ample proof that it has been cut and not merely torn. The edges are as smooth as if they had been slashed with a razor. A long slit is sometimes made as if by a single effort. In other cases several attempts appear to have been made before the covering has been open enough for the snake to get out. In one or two cases a tooth has not been inserted deeply enough, and the only result was a scratch on the inside of the covering. The egg tooth having performed its office becomes loose and drops out. This occurs usually within twenty-four hours.
When the slit has been successfully made, the little snake may sometimes be seen pushing its head carefully out as if to survey the surroundings. Should there be any movement, the head will be quickly withdrawn.
I have been able to collect some facts concerning the pairing of the sexes of Heterodon platirhinos. Prof. U. O. Cox, of Mankato, Minnesota, informs me that he found two individuals uniting some time in May. A second male was entwined with the two other snakes. The latter were separated with difficulty. The male intromittent organs are described as being of an oval form, an inch long, and over half an inch thick. :
Two observers have seen black specimens, formerly called H. niger, pairing with the spotted individuals. Prof. W. S. Blatchley! found a black and a spotted one copulating on April 19. He speaks in a letter to me of the intromittent organs as

Frontal plate as broad as long, generally longer than the parietals. Rostral broad and high. Azygos encircled by three to five small plates. Mouth very short. Dorsal rows twenty-five, the three or four externals smooth. Dorsal series of thirty-five blotches, with one alternating series on each side. Abdomen yellowish, scarcely maculated. A narrow black band across the forehead in front of the frontal and passing through the eye across one labial to the angle of the mouth. _
Frontal plate subheptagonal, sometimes nearly triangular; with three sides anteriorly, the lateral against the prefrontals, the middle against the azygous plates, the sides very obtusely angled. Superciliaries rather short, broad. Parietals very short, almost as long as broad. Prefrontals moderate, the exterior angle scarcely reaching the angle of the loreal; the two separated by three small plates posterior to the azygos. Internasals not much smaller. Azygous plate resting anteriorly against the rostral and touched by the inner angle of the internasal. ‘There is a small plate on each side, between it and the notch at the junction of the anterior and prefrontals, while behind, the space between it, the

prefrontals, and the frontal is occupied by the three small plates already mentioned. This azygos is thus surrounded on the sides and posteriorly by three small plates (this number is sometimes greater). Rostral broad and high, much recurved. Eyes moderate, situated posterior to the center of imaginary line connecting the last labial and rostral, which would pass nearly through its center. Loreal subtriangular, acute above, scarcely reaching to the exterior angle of the postfrontal, a small plate sometimes intervening. Nasal plates rather short and high; nostril occupying most of the posterior one, its infero-anterior wall constituted by the first labial, its lower by a small inferior nasal plate. Labials eight above; in one specimen of the six examined, there are seven; they increase very rapidly from the diminutive first; fifth and sixth largest; all much higher than broad. Lower labials nine. Curve of upper jaw very convex and short. Temporals four on both sides in five specimens; three on both sides in one.
Seales back of the head short, curved, obsoletely carinated. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-five, outer rows smooth, sometimes only three, the carination slight, increasing to the medial row. Scales shorter and broader than in the other type, becoming narrower on the back; those behind rather narrower than before. Body contracted at the anus, then expanding or swelling on the tail, which is thick throughout, tapering to the tip. Scales on the tail longer and broader than those of the upper part of the body in front; carination not very distinct, inferior three rows truncated behind, especially the highest.
A dorsal series of transverse black blotches, thirty-five from head to tip of tail, the twenty-seventh opposite the anus. These are sometimes oblique, but generally transverse, and with the anterior and posterior margins parallel. They are about nine scales wide and three to four long, with light-brownish yellow intervals one or one and a half scales wide. On each side and opposite the intervals is a distinct series of subquadrate or cirealar black spots on the sixth to ninth rows, not touching those on the back, and between them a dusky shade opposite the dorsal spots. Below these again are usually two smaller blotches to each spot. Intervals between the spots mottled yellowish-brown. Beneath yellowish, with obsolete small brown blotches. On the tail there are nine half-rings rather wider than the light intervals and somewhat contracted above.
A narrow black line crosses the forehead on the posterior half of the prefrontals, and just margining the frontal; this passes through the center of the eye and is continued to the posterior labial. A medial patch of black, expanding behind, starts from the commissure of the parietals, from which plates others, one on each side, pass across the angle of the jaws, the three confluent with the dark color in the parietals. In H. platyrhinus this medial patch is isolated and not in contact with the occipital one.
Some specimens from Abbeville, South Carolina, vary in having the

rostral separated from the prefrontals by two or three small plates, and the azygos entirely cut off from the internasals by intervening plates. The lower wall of the nostril is constituted by two small plates; there is a second small plate above the loreal; in fact, a general tendency to break up into small plates. The markings on the back are restricted to a dorsal series, with a dusky shade opposite, and a lateral series opposite the light yellowish intervals; the ground color of the sides a quite uniform yellowish-brown. Specimens from Mississippi have the dorsal spot smaller and nearly circular.
This is the most robust and the shortest species of the genus. Its range is the Austroriparian region, omitting western Texas, where the H. nasicus replaces it.

Frontal and parietal scuta usually wider than long, the parietals often shorter than the frontal. Head short; rostral plate very large and strongly recurved. No inferior nasal plate cut eff from the postnasal. Two or more loreals. Inferior labials*eight, all much higher than long. First row of temporals generally four. From three to twenty-four accessory scales beside and behind the azygous plate. Scales in twenty-three rows, all keeled except the first three on each side. Proportions of body more slender than in H. simus.
Color light yellowish-gray above, with a medium dorsal series of rather closely placed brown spots and with two alternating series of brown spots on each side. Three brown short longitudinal nuchal brown bands and a brown band from each eye posteriorly. Belly either entirely black cr tessellated with black and white.
This is the Western representative of the H. simus, to which it is nearly allied. It can be always distinguished, however, especially in its typical subspecies, by the characters given. A single specimen out of the many in the U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 4961) from Texas displays an inferior nasal plate.

In the H. n. kennerlyi in three out of six specimens the parietal scuta are shorter than the frontal. In sixteen of the H. n. nasicus, ten specimens have the parietals shorter than the frontal. In the small number of accessory scales the H. n. kennerlyi approaches nearer the H. simus than does the H. nx. nasicus. The same affinity is indicated by the smaller amount of black on the belly. It represents the genus in the Sonoran region, while the H. n. nasicus occupies the Central.

Head broad, very short anteriorly. Rostral plate very large. Loreal plate very small, sometimes absent. Only two supplemental plates behind azygos; the latter is sometimes replaced by two symmetrical contiguous plates and without any supplemental. The internasal and prefrontal in contact with the posterior process of the rostral. Dorsal row of scales twenty-three, all carinated except the first and second, which are perfectly smooth. Ground color light yellowish-gray; a dorsal series of rather indistinct rounded or subquadrate brown blotches; a second series of smaller circular spots much darker and more distinct; below this a third and more indistinct series.
In its general form and appearance this resembles the Heterodon nasicus nasicus, with which it is sometimes found associated. The body, however, is rather shorter and thicker than in that form, and the head is broader, with the part of the head anterior to the eye decidedly Shorter. The nasals are not as well developed longitudinally asin A. n. nasicus, but the result of this shortness of the anterior part of the head is seen in the very small loreal, which is frequently wanting entirely. There is never more than one loreal, while frequently two are seen in H. n. nasicus, in which the loreal is in every case strikingly larger than in H. n. kennerlyi. The most striking difference in these species is in the number of small plates surrounding the azygos, or postrostral. While in H. n. nasicus there are always at least ten of these, one or two of which margin the inner edges of the prenasals and prefrontals, there are never more than two, and frequently but one, additional plate in H. n. kennerlyi, and the prenasal and prefrontal are always in contact with the posterior process of the rostral. The azygos is short, nearly as broad as long, and usually there are just behind it two contiguous plates of about the same size separating it from the postfrontal, but not from the prefrontal. Frequently, however, the azygos is longitudinally divided and without any additional plates, but in contact with the rostral anteriorly and the vertical posteriorly, and not separated from the postfrontals. The frontal parietals, superciliaries, and labials are much as in H. n. nasicus, though generally less developed longitudinally. The rostral is as large as in H, n. nasicus.

The two outer dorsal rows are both perfectly smooth; in H. n. nasicus the second is distinctly though delicately carinate.
The ground color is light yellowish grey, with a dorsal series of rather indistinct subquadrate or rounded blotches, two to two and a half scales long, and separated by intervals of one or two scales, rather wider anteriorly. Below this is a series of very distinct purplish black cireular blotches, covering four scales transversely and two longitudinally; below this one or more indistinct series of spots. This pattern of coloration is very similar to that of H.n. nasicus, but the ground color is always lighter and less distinct. The upper lateral series is of a purplish black, and much more distinct, forming a prominent character.
Abdomen nearly entirely black, except afew yellow scuta. The head is marked as in H. n. nasicus except that the nasals, prefrontals, and rostral are all yellowish, while in the latter species they are dark in front of the light transverse line which crosses the crown behind the rostral; and in H. n. kennerlyi the light line across the superciliaries and vertical is much broader than in H.n. nasicus. This species differs from H.n. simus in many of the same features as does H, n.nasicus, These, together with the sinall or absent loreal and small number of supplemental plates, readily distinguish it.

Frontal broader than long. Rostral excessively broad and high. Azy gous plate surrounded behind and on the sides by many small plates (9-24). A second loreal. Labials short and excessively high. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three, exterior alone smooth. A dorsal series of about fifty blotches, with four or five others on each side. Body beneath black. A narrow white line across the middle of the superciliaries; a second behind the rostral. A broad dark patch from the eye to the angle of the mouth, crossing the last two labials.
Frontal plate very broad, subhexagonal. Parietals short. Rostral very broad, high, more than in the other species, outline rounded. The interval between the opposite frontals, the rostral, and the frontal occupied by a number of small plates, from nine to twenty-five, arranged

with symmetry on each side and behind the small azygos. The base of the rostral between the opposite anterior nasals is generally margined by these small plates, which sometimes, too, are seen between the frontal and the anterior portion of the superciliaries. This crowding of plates causes the anterior part of the forehead to be broader than in H.n. simus. Eye small, its center rather posterior to the middle of the imaginary line connecting the tip of rostral with the lower angle of the postlabial, which line scarcely crosses the eyeball.

eight above, all of them higher than long; indeed, their vertical extension is much greater than in any other species; the sixth highest, center of eye over the junction of the fifth and sixth.
Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three, outer row smooth, rest all distinctly carinated, the keels extending to the ends of the scales; those just behind the parietal plates truncated, with obsolete carinze. Seales on the hind part of the body rather broader and shorter than anteriorly; the inequality scarcely evident in large specimens.
Ground color light brown or yellowish gray, with about fifty dorsal blotches from head to tip of tail; the thirty-ninth opposite the anus. These blotches are quite small, rather longer transversely, subquadrate, or rounded, indistinctly margined with black, (obsoletely on the outside); they cover seven to nine scales across, are two to two and

<<<Page: 801>>>

one-half long, and separated by interspaces of one and one-half scales, which are pretty constant throughout, though rather narrower on the tail. On each side of the dorsal row may be made out, under favorable circumstances, four alternating rows of blotches; the first on the contiguous edges of the scales of the first and second exterior dorsal rows; the second on the scales of the third row, and the adjacent edges of those in the second and fourth; the third on the scales of the fourth, fifth, and sixth, and the adjacent edges of the third and seventh, and the fourth on the scales of the sixth, seventh, and eighth rows, and the adjacent edges of those of the fifth. This last is opposite the intervals of the dorsal series; the rest alternate with it. The central inferior surface of the abdominal scutelle is black, sharply variegated with quadrate spots of yellowish white; the portion of the scutellz entering into the side of the body is yellowish white, with that part opposite the dorsal intervals dark brown, thus, in fact, constituting a fifth lateral series of blotches, alternating with the lowest already mentioned. The throat and chin are unspotted. The head is light brown, with a narrow whitish line finely margined before and behind with black, which crosses in front of the center of the vertical and through the middle of the superciliaries; a second similar but more indistinet line runs parallel to this, just behind the rostral, and extending down in front of the eye. <A third equally indistinct and similar line crosses the posterior angle of the vertical and runs back on theside of the neck, behind the labials and temporal shields. There is a broad brown patch from the back part of the eye to the angle of the mouth, across the penultimate and last labial. The coloration is thus very different from that of H.n. simus, where there is a distinct narrow black band across the forehead scarcely involving the vertical, and passing through the eye to the angle of the mouth across the last labial. Behind this a much broader yellowish band, continued without interruption into the neck behind the angle of the mouth, In H. n. nasicus the most conspicuous feature is a narrow white band, much narrower than the darker patch before and behind it. The dark patch, to the angle of the mouth, is much broader, continuous, as it were, with the broad bar between the middle and anterior light lines, which corresponds with the narrow black line of H.n. simus. The other distinguishing features are evident. The three dark patches behind the head are much as in H.n. simus.
In the larger specimens from Sonora and the copper mines the ground color is yellowish gray, each scale minutely punctate with brown. The blotches are all obsolete, only one dorsal and two lateral on each side being defined by darker shades. The blotches on the sides of the abdomen are wanting, but the black in the middle is strongly marked. Theother characters, however, are preserved, except that the exterior row of dorsal scales is more or less carinated.

LEPTOGNATHIN 42. There are three genera of this subfamily, which differ as follows:
Geneial plates paired, longitudinal. ............. Petalognathus Duméril and Bibron. Geneial plates paired, transverse ................Leptognathus Duméril and Bibron. Geneial plates inclosing a median shield......................---2Mesopeltis Cope.
I have referred to this family several genera from the Oriental (Paleotropical) Realm, as Pareas, Asthenodipsas, Dipsadoboa, ete.; but an examination of the penial and pulmonary structures shows that Pareas belongs to the Calamarinie, and I suspect that the other Oriental genera are allied to it. Thus reduced, the Leptognathine include only Neotropical species, and none of these are found in the West Indian district. The species are numerous in the Central and South Ameri

<<<Page: 803>>>

can districts. They are snakes of fragile structure, inhabitants of brush, with feeble dentition. The head has the appearance of that of a foetal snake, with the short nose and large eye. They are said by Duméril and Bibron to live on Mollusca. Their immense tracheal lung distinguishes them from the Dromicinze, which they resemble in penial characters.
The hemipenis in Leptognathus is not bifureate, but the sulcus is deeply so. It is calyculate from the bifurcation of the sulcus to the extremity, and the calyes are fringed. Below them the organ is furnished with hooked spines halfway to the base. Below them the sur-
face is smooth. COLUBRIN XX.
This subfamily includes representatives of the Calamarinz, Cozonelline, Lycondontine, Colubrine, and Dryadinz of authors, and includes burrowing, ground, and arboreal types. The group is especially characteristic of Palearctica and Nearctica, but numerous forms occur also in the Oriental, Ethiopian, and Neotropical realms. There is a general similarity in penial structure, the diversities being of minor importance and some of them not yet fully understood. I have been able to abolish the division Coronelline, which never had any real standing, and also to show that Hallowell was right when he referred the Lycodon rufozonatus of authors to the neighborhood of Coronella. The genera of burrowing habits and generally small size, which were variously referred to the Calamarine and Coronelline, generally have the ruching of the hemipenis reduced and replaced by spines. This is conspicuous in Stylasonia, and especially in Conopsis, where there is but one row of calyces, and in Adelphicus and Trimetopon, where the cups are replaced by unossified papille.
In the typical species of Ophibolus the calyces are much reduced in number and replaced by spines. Some genera have the borders of the calyces conspicuously papillose, while in others they are smooth, but intermediate conditions connect them. In some forms there are smooth patches on the apex of the organ, but the value of this character is uncertain. In Cynophis I have found a remarkable apical awn, but as I have had the opportunity of examining but one individual, I am not sure how constant itis. In the Tropidoclonium lineatum, where a similar character is present, I have found it to be entirely constant. I give the following synopsis of the genera which I have been able to examine:
I, Hypapophyses not piercing esophagus.

This subfamily includes the ground snakes which are characteristic of the two great northern land areas, Eurasia and North America, but numerous species occur in the regions to the southward, especially in the Oriental and Neotropical realms. The dentition is isodont or coryphodont, between which no line of demarcation exists, although a few forms (Zamenis for example) present in some of the species the diacranterian type. In a few (for example, Dinodon) the median teeth are longer than those that immediately follow them. In this subfamily, as in most of the others, a tendency to a burrowing habit and fusiform shape appears. The beginning of this is seen in Coronelia, and in Ophibolus, and it becomes very pronounced in a number of genera which inhabit the warmer parts of North America and the Central American district of the neotropical realm. All the truly burrowing genera of the Colubrine are American, and they display affinities to genera in which this habit is less marked. Thus the burrowing Stylosoma is related to Ophibolus of the spotted type and Cemophora to the annulate type of the allied genus Osceola. Other fusiform burrowing genera are Chilomeniscus, Geagras, Conopsis, and Ficimia. On the other hand, the passage to arboreal types is easy. In the Oriental region Dendrophis is the typical tree snake, and in Africa we

This species is very constant in the scale formula, preserving fifteen rows in twenty-seven specimens in which I have counted them. The labials are always seven, the only exception being a specimen which had met with an injury on the top of the head (Cat. No. 1495), The fourth labial on the right side and the first and fifth on the left are abnormally divided obliquely. The relation of the loreal to the nasal is changed in four specimens on both sides, and in one, on one side, by the fusion of the two plates. In two specimens there are two preoculars on both sides, and in one on one side only. In another (Cat. No. 434) the oculars are 2-3.
The Liopeltis vernalis has a rie range, embracing the entire Eastern, Austroriparian, and Central regions. It is found in the hilly parts of New Mexico, but is rare in Texas. Florida specimens are highly colored. It is in the North that the species especially abound, being much more common in my experience in Massachusetts than in Pennsylvania. Professor Verrill gives it as commonly found at Norway, Maine. It is absolutely harmless.

The number of scale rows I found to be constantly seventeen in thirty-two specimens examined, as also the superior labial plates, which are always seven. The loreal plate I found rudimental on one side of one specimen, and once confluent with the nasal on one side only, as is sometimes the case on both sides in Liopeltis vernalis. I found two preoculars on one side in two specimens only. In one there are anomalously three on both sides (Cat. No, 1447). In the same specimen there are two loreals, one above the other, on both sides. In three specimens there is but one temporal of the second row on both sides, and in those there is one of the second row on one side only. The length of the

tail var’es from two and one-third times to nearly three times in the total leugth. The twenty-two specimens measured run as follows: Two and one-third times in total length, Cat. No. 9586; two and twofifths, Cat. Nos. 1447, 12027; two and one-half, Cat. Nos. 1502, 1460, 1433, 1646; two and three-fifths, Cat. Nos. 1439, 9692, 7196; two and two-thirds, Cat.

No. 1437; two and six-sevenths, Cat. No. 7197; two and nineteen-twentieths, Cat. No. 1436b.
Baird and Girard have proposed certain individuals as a distinet species under the name of Leptophis majalis, on account of the somewhat shorter tail. Individuals from New Mexico have shorter tails than those from the Atlantic region, but the gradation in length is complete. Floridan specimens differ ‘rom others in having the keels of the scales stronger and in having the second row strongly keeled like the third, while it is smooth in other specimens; but no other character coincides with this one.
I have described a peculiar habit of this species.!

Boulenger distinguishes two principal divisions of ground Colubridze as genera under the names Zamenis and Coluber on dental characters. In the former the maxillary teeth increase in size posteriorly, while in the latter the posterior teeth are not longer, and may be shorter than

<<<Page: 813>>>

the anterior. That this distinction is valid in many instances is well known, but it is admitted by Boulenger that in other instances the transitions are complete. An examination of the penial characters leads me to the opinion that each of these groups is a series of genera rather than a single genus. Thus in the Zamenis gemonensis, the type of the genus, we have the normal colubrine structure, from which two divergent lines may be traced. In one of these, represented by the Z. ventrimaculatus, the calyces preserve their character, but the few papille are ossified as acute spines, the character defining the genus Acanthocalyx. In another direction the walls of the calyces are thickened and support several series of papille. This is seen in the Z. ravergierii. In the next type these numerous papille are ossified, giving us the genus Gonyosoma. A greater modification is seen in the Z. florulentus. Here the thickening of a part of the calyx walls is greatly increased, while other walls, including all of the longitudinal ones, disappear. The result is a mass of papillose pads, a character quite different from anything else in the order and one which defines the genus Tylanthera, The explanation of this structure is rendered possible by that of the Zamenis ravergierti.
The North American species referred to Zamenis by Boulenger have been separated under the name Bascanium by Baird and Girard. Most if not all of these species differ from the typical Zamenis gemonensis in possessing one or two large hooks at the proximal part of the spinous tract, which remind one of the Natricine, and which are not found in the typical forms of Zamenis. The Drymobius pulcherrimus Cope possesses a similar peculiarity, which separates it from the typical species of that genus. It differs from the species of bascanium, however, in having the large spines distad to the spinous tract and_ not proximad.
The proposition of Boulenger to combine the forms into the genus Zamenis, which have been hitherto separated, throws light on the subject, by emphasizing the weakness of the dental characters regarded by Duméril and Bibron as definitive of the genera so included. My discovery of the penial characters, however, shows that this aggregate includes several genera, which may now be satisfactorily defined. Without these Boulenger’s Zamenis is as.difficult to define as a whole as any of the whole groups which he has included in it. How far some of these penial characters are definitive of genera remains in some cases to be ascertained. Thus the disposition of the large spines in the American species is constant in all of them excepting in the Z, constrictor, where it is not constant; but I have not yet ascertained how far this inconstancy goes, or whether it precludes the ultimate adoption of the genus Bascanium or not. The definition of this group is as follows:
Head distinct; cephalic plates normal. Teeth increasing gradually in size posteriorly, not grooved, Scales smooth, in an odd number of

<<<Page: 814>>>

series, with two apical fosse. Subcaudal scutellie in two series; anal plate divided. Two preoculars; loreal present; two nasal plates. Form elongate.
The species of this genus are elongate in form and active in movement, so that the popular names of “whip-snake” and ‘racer” are appropriate. Although at home on the ground they climb bushes and low trees, rarely ascending to any great height. They are skillful in capturing young birds, as well as small mammals and reptiles. They are distributed over al! North America south of the boreal region, and are represented, like most of our other genera of snakes, by a greater multiplicity of forms in the southwestern section of the continent. One species inhabits Mexico exclusively. The species are distinguished as follows:
I. Scales in seventeen rows; superior labials seven. (Frontal plate nearly as wide

<<<Page: 815>>>

Some of the species above admitted are nearly allied, and young specimens are sometimes not readily referred to their proper places. In the first place, although the eyes of young Vertebrata are relativély larger than those of the adult, yet the superciliary plates in this genus encroach more on the frontal in mature than in young specimens, so that in the former the frontal plate is more narrowed posteriorly than — in the latter. The color characters of young individuals of Z. lateralis and Z. teniatus are sometimes not fully developed, so that their reference is difficult. In ail of the species the head plates are pale-bordered in the young, and this character may or may not be continued to maturity in Z. teniatus. Z. constrictor and Z, flagellum are crossbanded and spotted in youth, but this character disappears except on the anterior dorsal region of the latter species, where it is frequently retained.
The species are distributed as follows:
Eastern region: Z. constrictor.
Austroriparian region: Z. constrictor ; Z. flagellum.
Central region: Z. constrictor; Z. teniatus.
Pacific region: Z. constrictor; Z. flagellum; Z. teniatus; B. lateralis.
Sonoran region: Z. flagellum; Z. piceus; Z. schottii; Z. lateralis; Z. ornatus; Z, teniatus. ;
The number of rows of scales is very constant. Apparent exceptions are referred to under the head of Z. lateralis. The number of labial scuta is very constant except in the Californian representatives of Z. constrictor. The small inferior preocular plate is very constant in Bascanium, its only absence being noticed in a very few specimens of the Californian form of Z. constrictor. The temporal scales are always normally 2-2-2, and rarely vary from it.
The anterior and posterior parts of the body are frequently differently colored in this genus. This is especially the case with Z. flagellum, Z. f. semilineatus, and Z. ornatus, where the posterior region is paler than the anterior, and is lacking in the pattern. In Z. constrictor the transition from the black to the green variety is first seen in fading out of the black on the tail and posterior part of the body.
As regards the striped forms we have evidence how the young differ from the adult in Z. semilineatus and Z. teniatus. In these the tendency to form distinet wider bands is stronger than in the adult, where they are subdivided and more or less obliterated. Thus the young of both these forms resemble more Z. lateralis than do the adults. We may then regard Z, lateralis as representing a primitive form for this series. The primitive form for Z. flagellum and Z. constrictor was probably a cross-banded form, but no such species isknown. In this respect the last-named species resemble the species of the genus Drymobius, where the young are cross-banded or spotted. Some spotted Drymobii are known where the adults are spotted.

The remains of a Zamenis were found by Mr. C. M. Wheatley in the bone cave at Port Kennedy, Pennsylvania, which furnished so many species of extinct Mammalia.

lustrous pitch black to brownish green above, and beneath from greenish black, sometimes tinged with greenish white, to yellow. Chin and

throat white. The young are olive, with rhomboidal dorsal blotches; beneath greenish white.
Frontal plate much longer than broad, pentagonal, anterior margin convex, the lateral strongly concave, the plate rapidly diminishing to half its length, thence the sides nearly parallel, terminated by a rather obtuse angle; a little shorter than the parietals. Superciliaries large, rather broad. Rostral rather broad and high, wedged to a slight extent between the prefrontals. Eye large, its center before the middle of the commissure and over the fourth labial. The lower anteorbital very small, wedged in between the upper anteorbital, the loreal, the third labial, and the eye. Loreal trapezoidal, oblique, moderate. Labials above seven; the first, third, and fifth smaller than the rest, the third and fourth entering into the orbit; the fourth the only one in contact with the lower postorbital; sixth and seventh largest. Lower labials eight, the fifth much the largest. Tworows of temporal scales bet ween the labials and occipitals. Exterior row of dorsal scales very large, diminishing gradually on the back. Scales very thin, the posterior angle moderately truncate, so as to give an elongated hexagonal shape to the exposed portion. Exposed surface of exterior row nearly as high as long.
Color above uniform lustrous pitch black, beneath slate color, sometimes tinged with greenish white. Lower jaw and chin and sometimes edge of the upper labials white. Specimens from the West and Southwest exhibit a more or less bright olive green with the whole under surface greenish white to bright yellow. In one or two specimens there is but one anteorbital.
The young of this species are variegated in color instead of being uniform. The ground color is dark olive, with a succession of darker rhomboidal dorsal blotches from head to tail. These are about nine scales wide, and four or five long, separated by lighter intervals, which, narrow along the kack, widen of course rapidly toward the abdomen. The edge of each scale is obsoletely lighter than the center, the dark centers in some scales being of such intensity as to produce the impression of distinct spots, especially on the sides. Along the vertebral region the margins of the blotches are narrowly darker, and those of the intervals lighter than on the sides. Beneath greenish white, each scutella with from two to four dark spots on the edges. Top of head yellowish gray, posterior margins of both pairs of frontals dark chestnut, as are the contiguous edges of the superciliaries and vertical, and posterior edges of the superciliaries and occipitals as well as a small blotch on the outer edge of the superciliaries, and a broad patch in the center of the occipitals running up into the vertical. Sides of head white, especially labials and orbitals; tinged with bluish behind the eyes, and spotted with dark brown.
Specimens over 18 inches lose the blotching, and become more and

<<<Page: 818>>>

more uniform, although to a considerable size showing traces of the spots on the abdominal scutelle.
Transitions between the Eastern black and the Western green forms of this species are frequently met with in the region connecting the two habitats. Thus in Michigan the species is generally of a bluish ereen or greenish blue tint above, and is known as the * blue racer.” Similar specimens are in the U.S. National Museum from New Orleans. On th: yellow-bellied form of the Plains, Say proposed his Coluber flaviventris, which was regarded as a distinct species by Hallowell and by Baird and Girard. I, however, do not find it to be more than a geographical color race. The same color characterizes specimens from the Pacific district, which are also inferior in size to Eastern individuals, and frequently have the head a little shorter. In spite of this fact they incline to develop an additional labial plate, the number being occasionally in this region eight on one or both sides. Thus of eleven black Eastern specimens only two have eight superior labials on both sides. Of twenty-two yellow-bellied specimens, three have the labials, seven on one side and eight on the other, and nine have eight on both sides. Of the twelve specimens thus exceptional, seven are from the Pacific region and five from the great basin of Nevada aud Utah, of the Centralregion. This is the Bascanium vetustum of Baird and Girard. In the type specimen the sixth upper labial reaches the lower postocular; but this is exceptional and rarely occurs in Californians or other individuals.
A remarkable color variety of this species was described by me under the name of Bascanium anthicum. In this form the general color is as in the dark-bluish tinted variety, but numerous scales on all parts of the body are a bright yellow. Th» yellow scales are rarely regularly arranged, but sometimes show a tendency to a distribution in chevronshaped crossbands. <A specimen of this kind was sent me by my friend Prof. Pendleton King, from near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The typical specimen, which is in the U. 8S. National Museum, is of uncertain locality, but was alleged to have been brought from Siam, most probably erroneously.
Another color variety is represented by a single specimen (Cat. No. 10481) from Galveston, Texas. It is of the yellow-bellied type, but the dorsal color is yellowish brown, and small black specks rather sparsely mark the gastrosteges, and from two to four inferior rows of scales throughout the length. The loreal is as high as long.
A black Zamenis was described by Baird and Girard as having been brought from California, under the name of B. fremontii. The specimen is a typical Z. constrictor, and was taken probably in the Eastern region. The Bb. foxii Baird and Girard is the same.

The length and diameter of the tail vary considerably, some being quite slender and others quite robust. Of the slender-tailed forms, two (Cat. Nos. 8298, 4498) are females. The lengths are as follows: B. ¢. constrictor: three and one-fifth in total length, Cat. No. 8298; three and three-fifths, Cat. No. 4447; three and two-thirds, Cat. No. 11440; three and three-fourths, Cat. Nos. 1764, 4448; four and two-fifths, Cat. Nos. 7194,1788; four and one-half, Cat. No. 4444; four and three-quarters, Cat. No. 10650. B. ¢. flaviventris: three and two-fifths, Cat. No. 10717; three and two-thirds, Cat. No. 12588; three and four-fifths, Cat. No. 4418; three and six-sevenths, Cat. No. 2132; four, Cat. No. 1741; four and one-tenth, Cat. No. 7812; four and one-third, Cat. No. 7812); four and two-fifths, Cat. No. 12581.
The Zamenis constrictor is the “‘black snake” of the East and the “blue” and “ green racer” of the West. It is everywhere an active, vigorous snake, getting over the ground or through the branches of bushes with great rapidity. It is courageous, and will sometimes attack, movying forward’with the head raised from 1 to 2 feet above the ground. It, however, quickly turns about and runs if the enemy preserves a bold front. In confinement it is sometimes quite irascible, showing attack on every movement of its captor. It is, however, easily tamed, and then takes food, being said to be especially fond of milk. Of all our snakes it is the most useful to the farmer, from the great number of moles and mice which it consumes. It is also a robber of birds’ nests.
Dr. Henry Brons gives the following account of the courtship of the green racer of the Kansas plains:!
The manner of union of the sexes at this season is rather instructive. The female among the racers ( Bascanium) is larger and darker than the males, and not so grace-
1 American Naturalist, 1882, p. 365.

<<<Page: 820>>>

ful in form or movements. She, at times, seems to toy with the male, indisposed to yield to his importunities, though pressed with ardor. To avoid his suit, at times, she will dart through grass, among stones, or enter a crevice. Should he be able to reach his mate while within a hole, he is not slow in bringing her to the surface, again to be repulsed. Upon an unbroken ground the sexual communion is less prolonged. Here she is unable to free herself from his quick and effectively directed moves. In case she attempts to quit him, a coil is thrown about her body, and his head laid flat upon her neck, and replaced as promptly as dislodged, evidently in the endeavor to propitiate her.
The constricting power of the black snake is not sufficient to cause inconvenience toa man, but might seriously oppress a child. The pressure exercised by a strong individual wound round the arm is sufficient to compress and close the superficial veins, and cause the muscles to ache, but it is easy to unwind the snake with the free hand and arm. The black snake is harmless, and its bite, which it rarely inflicts, only amounts to a serious scratch.

This species and the last one are founded on a single specimen each, which were obtained in nearly the same region of country. They resemble each other considerably in proportions, size, and coloration. The differences are, however, so numerous and important that it is impossible to regard them as belonging to the same species. They

<<<Page: 824>>>

differ equally from all others, the nearest approach to the Z. stejnegerianus being made by abnormal individuals of the flaviventris form of Z. constrictor, which have eight superior labial shields. The very different form of the loreal plate, and its subdivision, in the latter, together with the contrast between the color of the head and the dorsum, will distinguish it.

Kight superior labials; scales in seventeen rows. Frontal plate narrowed posteriorly, only half as wide as the supraoculars at the same point. Muzzle projecting slightly conic, profile decurved; form slender. The young with transverse spots, more numerous than in Z. constrictor.
This widely distributed species is represented by several color forms. These may be aggregated into two types or subspecies, which differ as follows:

rest of the scale more or less mottled with the different shades of brown. The darkest tint is usually seen near the tip of the scales, this ou the tail forming a distinct margin. Beneath, the color is yellowishwhite, on the anterior fifth more or less blotched with brown or nearly uniform brown, posterior to which it disappears more or less entirely, being represented only by occasional dashes. The ends of each scutella, however, on their margins exhibit the brownish or yellowish blotches, and are colored much like the sides of the body at that place. Anteorbital mostly yellow; postorbital frequently so.
The tail is about one-fourth the total length, but varies within the following range: Three and two-third times in total, Cat. No. 8175; three and three fourths times, Cat.

The color variations of this species are as follows: In half-grown Eastern specimens the head is light brown, with darker cross shades on the head and nape. In adult Eastern specimens the head and from one-fourth to two-thirds the length of the body are deep brown. In Texan adult specimens the anterior regions are sometimes of a strong brown color, but generally they are pale, the top of the head only being of alight brown. In adults from the Sonoran and Pacific regions the posterior part of the head and several wide cross-bands on the nape are of a dark brown or even of a blackish color. In specimens from Arizona these are followed by pink cross-bands, which appear only on the anterior fourth or fifth of the length of the body. In Californian specimens in the National Museum these pink cross-bands appear indistinctly. In specimens from La Paz, at the southern extremity of Lower California, the entire body is a citron yellow, with some black appearing between the scales when the skin is stretched. The head and nape are spotted as in the Californian individuals. » In young specimens from Georgia and Florida, as well as from the West, the chin throat and anterior part of the belly for a short distance are spotted by ill-defined spots of light brown. These are represented by cloudy shades, or are entirely lost in the prevailing brown color in Eastern adult specimens. In Texan specimens they disappear entirely in some large adults. In Sonoran and Californian specimens they continue permanently, the spots forming a row on each side of the anterior part of the belly, and blotching the inferior and superior labials. The speckled brown of the temporal region is divided by a pale line extending from the eye posteriorly.
In younger specimens the blotching beneath is more decided. In addition to the colors described, the back is crossed by indistinct bars of darker, eight or nine scales wide and half a scale long. This color is also seen on the skin between the scales under the dark bars, where the bases of the scales themselves are darker instead of light. There is a tendency toward stripes on the side: First, one of light brown on the outer edge of the abdomen; then an interrupted yellow one at the Junction of the abdominal scutellze and outer scales; then brown again through the centers of the rows. This, however, is not very conspicuous. Sometimes the dark shades on the sides are vinged with reddish. The obsolete transverse bars are seen at intervals of one or two scales.

A specimen from Fort Webster or Copper Mines shows the stripes
on the sides much more distinctly, running through all the dorsal rows ©
anteriorly, and crossed by the indistinct bars already referred to. The contrast between the dark chestnut-brown spots on each side and its deeper center, with the clear yellow of the edges, is very distinct. Beneath yellow, with the blotches reduced to mere dull spots.

Specimens in which the dark cross bands behind the head are very pronounced have been referred by Dr. Stejneger to a distinct subspecies under the name of Z. f. frenatus. It is true that all specimens from west of the Rio Grande exhibit this character, but in Cat. No. 15970 from Yuma, Arizona, and Cat. No. 4388 from Lajoya, New Mexico, the spots are absent, save a few traces only. They are, in fact, a persistence of the immature coloration, as is especially conspicuous in the type of Z. f. frenatus, where the cross bands are present on the greater part of the length. The character is, to my mind, too variable to offer a definition.
I have met with this species in Texas, where it is abundant. I
obtained specimeus from near Dallas, Houston, Brenham, Helotes, and_
the upper waters of the Guadalupe and the Llano rivers. Those from Dallas, Brenham, and Houston, which are in the rainy region of Texas. have the greater part of the length a blackish-brown. Those fron: Helotes, the Guadalupe, and the Llano are entirely pale clay-color. This relation of color to moisture is similar to that observed by Dr. J. A. Allen to prevail among the rodent Mammalia. This is a swift species, and is generally known everywhere as the ‘“‘ whip snake.”
This species ranges south into Mexico on the plateau, and southward on the western slope. Thus I have recorded it from Chihuahua, Guanajuato, and Guadalaxara:

Bascanium piceum Corr, Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., XVI, 1893, p. 625.
Form elongate, tail three and three-fifth times in the total length. Head elongate, muzzle narrowed forward, moderately protuberant, not flattened, slightly decurved. Rostral plate slightly recurved above; internasals longer than wide. Frontal half as wide as superciliaries behind. Parietals openly truncate, emarginate at posterior margin. Loreal large, longer than high. Temporals 2-2-2. Superior labials eighth, fourth and fifth bounding orbit, sixth subtriangular, seventh and eighth larger and nearly equal, and longer than high. Inferior labials

ten, fifth largest; postgeneials not longer than pregeneials. Scales in 19 longitudinal rows, moderately narrowed in the type, but in other specimens in only seventeen rows. Gastrosteges, 195; anal, 1; urosteges, 108.
Measurements.—Total length, 1,263 mm.; the tail, 355 mm.; end of muzzle to rictus oris, 34 mm.
Color above, to, and including the extremities of the gastrosteges, black. Inferior surfaces light yellow, the anterior fifth of the length with brownish blotches, which are posteriorly few and distant, but become larger and more approximated, until the anterior 30-40 gastrosteges are brown or anteriorly black like the superior surfaces. Labial plates with some pale shades on their middles. Preocular with a light middle, postoculars black. Top of head a little paler than back.
This form might be regarded as a melanistic Z. flagelliformis but for the increased number of scale rows, and longer tail. The fact that the

<<<Page: 830>>>

inferior surface does not generally take part in the darkened color indicates a normal color type.

between those of Z. teniatum and Z. lateralis, and part like that of Z. flagellum. Its adult characters ally it most nearly to the last named, but its appearance is quite distinct.
The scales are in seventeen rows, and there are eight superior labials. The posterior part of the frontal is only half as wide as the superciliary plate at the same point. The temporal scales are 2-2-2. The fourth and fifth labials bound the orbit below. The loreal is larger than high. The postgeneials are a little larger than the pregeneials. The muzzleis not decurved, and is moderately protuberant, viewed in profile; from above it is elongate wedge-shaped. The tail is long, entering the total length in the specimen before me (Cat. No. 1981) three and one-seventh times.
The general color is a light brownish clay-color (in spirits), the free border of each scale with an elongate whitish spot on each side. The color becomes darker anteriorly so as to be on the anterior fourth of the length, a plumbeous green, with the top of the head light brown.

<<<Page: 831>>>

There are no markings on the superior surface of this region, but the sides are striped, the stripes disappearing on the second fourth of the length of the body. These stripes are bounded by a brown line on the middle of each scale of the second and third rows. Between these the color is like that of the back, while the adjacent halves of the third and fourth rows are light yellow. A fainter brown line runs along the — middle of the first row. Belly and throat immaculate light yellow, except a few puncte along the end of the first dozen gastrosteges. Middles of nasal, loreal, and preand postocular plates yellow. Superior labials yellow, with a blackish superior border, extending from the rostral plate back. Temporal region like the top of the head, immaculate. A few black specks on the geneial margins of the inferior labials.
Gastrosteges 201, anal 1; urosteges, 134+. Total length (Cat. No. 1981), 1,185 mm.; of tail (extremity wanting), 375 mm.
A young specimen (Cat. No. 8434) is interesting as showing the distinct: ness of the color characters as compared with those of corresponding age of the Z. teniatus and with the adult Z. schottii and Z. lateralis. In the first place, the stripes are much more distinct in this specimen than in the adults, as is the case also with the Z. teniatus. Moreover, they extend farther along the length of the body, being traceable on the middle third, though they are wanting posterior to it. The stripes are a yellow one on adjacent parts of the third and fourth rows, bounded below by a brown one on the adjacent parts of the second and third rows. A yellow stripe succeeds on the adjacent parts of the first and second rows, while another and paler brown stripe runs on the adjacent parts of the first row and the extremities of the gastrosteges. This pattern, it will be observed, is quite different from that which obtains in any of the other striped species, as the M. teniatus, ornatus, schottit, or lateralis. The head is entirely uniform greenish slate color above and on the temples. The superior labials are yellow, the posterior bounded above by a black line from the orbit to the neck. The muzzle of this specimen is broken off.

ZAMENIS LATERALIS Hallowell.

Form slender, head oval, distinct from body, tail a little less than onethird the total length. Scales in seventeen longitudinal rows; superior labials eight, the fourth and fifth bounding the orbit below. Muzzle not elongate nor decurved, but flattened, and its extremity but little prominent. Rostral plate slightly recurved on upper surface of muzzle. Internasals as wide as long. Frontal narrowed behind, half as wide as superciliary in adults. .Parietals truncate-marginate posteriorly. Dorsal longer than high. Sixth superior labial truncate above; seventh and eighth longer than ‘ high. Nine inferior labials, the fifth largest. Postgeneials longer than pregeneials. Temporals 2-2-2. ~ Color above, including ends of gastrosteges, plumbeous brown; below yellow.

Cat. No. 11776, U.S.N.M. scales. Lateral head plates from the preoculars forward, with yellow centers. Superior labials with brown splotches above, forming an irregular border, not brown bordered below. A yellow temporal spot.
The posterior labial plates are longer than high, but are not so extended asin the Z. aurigulus. The inferior labials anterior to and including the fifth are also less elongate, the fourth being nearly square, while it is parallelogrammic in the Z. aurigulus. The muzzle, and hence the loreal plates, are shorter than in that form. The spotting of the inferior surface is confined to the chin, throat, and a dozen or so of gastrosteges. It consists of scattered brown spots which are nearly symmetrical on opposite sides, and which fall into two more or less irregular rows, each a short distance within the extremities of the gastrosteges.
The seventeen rows of scales, together with the coloration, distinguish this form from the Z. schottii and the Z. teniatus. Young specimens of the latter, however, resemble it closely, since the Spaces between the dark lines of the first, second, and third rows are apt to be solidly darkcolored at that age. They may be distinguished, apart from the smaller

<<<Page: 833>>>

number (fifteen) of scale rows, by the different distribution of the lateral stripes. In Z. l. lateralis the yellow stripe is confined to the third and fourth rows, and the dark band below it covers the extremities of the gastrosteges. In the Z. teniatus the yellow stripe extends to the fifth row of scales, and the inferior band only reaches to the middle of the first row, not attaining the gastrosteges. In Z, schottii the superior lateral stripe is as in Z. l. lateralis, but the belly is dark anc there is a yellow stripe on the adjacent edges of the gastrosteges and first row of scales. The head is unicolor and not spotted, as in the Z. l. lateralis. The yellow temporal spot of both forms of the Z. lateralis is to be noted as always absent from the allied species. The Z. semilinatus agrees with the lateralis in the possession of seventeen rows of scales, and the young is more fully striped than the adult. It may be distinguished at all ages by the arrangement of the lateral stripes and, the uniform coloration of the head. The yellow stripe is, like that of the Z. lateralis, on the third and fourth rows only, but the dark band below it only occupies the adjacent parts of the second and third rows, instead of extending to the gastrosteges. There is a yellow band on the adjacent parts of the first and second rows which is absent in the Z. lateralis, and there is a dark stripe on the adjacent part of the first row and the gastrosteges, where the inferior yellow stripe is present in the Z. schottii. The belly is light, and not dark, as in the last-mentioned species.

Scales in seventeen rows, those of the median series very elongate. Crown and muzzle very plane, supercilium and canthus rostralis prominent; eye moderate, muzzle more elongate than in any other species of the genus. Rostral plate rounded, slightly prominent, recurved above. Frontal elongate, posteriorly half as wide as each superciliary, not in contact with preocular. Parietals elongate, posteriorly

als eight, fourth and fifth entering orbit; the eighth equal in elevation and length to the penultimate; both much longer than high. Inferior labials ten, fifth largest; postgeneials longer than pregeneials.
Color above brown, becoming nearly black anteriorly. Cephalic plates light brown, shaded with yellow. A narrow yellow band passes round the muzzle from eye to eye. A spot on the temporal region, one on the postoculars; all the labials, the chin, and anterior part of the abdomen bright golden and unspotted, as are also the sides of the neck and anterior fourth of body to the fifth row of scales. On the second and third rows of scales of the latter region is a black band regularly interrupted at intervals of about seven scales, which bounds a yellow lateral stripe above it where present. It finally becomes continuous, and with a band upon the first row almost excludes the yellow ground color upon the posterior and middle parts of the body. Abdomen dirty yellowish, unspotted.
Proportions slender, but the specimen does not include the posterior half of the length. This curiously marked species mostly resembles the Z. lateralis. The lateral stripe is confined to the third and fourth rows opposite the lateral black stripe, but at the interruptions extend

<<<Page: 836>>>

to the fifth. The muzzle is more elongate, hence also the nasal and loreal plates and the penultimate and ultimate superior labials are longer. The tendency of the coloration is to produce two series of alternating yellow and black spots along the anterior part of the length. The narrower form of the posterior superior labials distinguishes the type from most individuals of the Z. lateralis lateralis, but in a specimen of the latter from Baird, California, these scales approximate nearly the form in the present subspecies.
According to Mr. Van Denburgh this species is quite rare, the explorations of the California Academy of Sciences having brought to light only one other specimen.

of the outer dorsal row and the abdominal scutellx, involving only the adjacent angles; the second similiarly constituted in relation to the third and fourth rows (not running through the centers of the scales). The portion of the third and fourth rows not involved by the upper white line is black, as is also a narrow margin above the lower white line, of the same diameter with it. The upper angles of the scales in the first row, and the whole of those of the second row, are of a lighter olive than the back. All the scales on the back between the upper

yellow lines of the opposite sides are margined with yellow along their basal edges, only evident on separating the scales. Anteriorly is a short yellow line along the junction of the second and third rows of scales, extending to about the twenty-fifth abdominal scutella.
Color beneath, with the greater part of the scutelle, closely and minutely blotched with greenish slate. Anteriorly a shade of yellow appears, and near the head the blotching is in two series, as in the rest of the genus. The tail also is nearly unspotted yellowish, except anteriorly. On the external fourth of the abdominal scutelle the blotching is more confluent, forming a well-defined margin to the lower yellow line. Anteriorly the side of the abdomen is of a dull red. The upper jaw is yellowish white, excepting the lower edges along the first to the sixth labials, which are black. Orbitals, loreal, and nasals with a yellow central spot.
The lateral stripes become obsolete at about three-fifths of the length from the head, so that the body posteriorly is nearly unicolor above. Upper labials yellow, unspotted, but margined below (except the last two) with black, and margined above with greenish slate posterior to the orbit, and brown anterior to it. The nasals, loreal, and preocular have yellow median spot each, but the temporal region and top of head are a uniform greenish slate.
Baird and Girard give the following scutal formula, and measurements in inches: -
Eagle Pass, Texas; gastroteges, 201+1; urosteges, 138; total length, 544; tail, 173.
But two adult specimens referable to this species are known, and they agree in every respect, and differ in coloration and the form of the frontal plate from eight specimens of the Z. lateralis, which species they most nearly resemble. The latter all possess also seventeen rows of scales, while the Z. schottii possesses fifteen. Some young specimens, however, are in some respects intermediate. So far as regards the form of the frontal plate their characters may be those of immaturity. Thus Cat. No. 11423 has in all respects the coloration of the Z. lateralis, but has only fifteen rows of scales. Cat. No. 1982 has a trace of the inferior lateral stripe of the Z. schottii, but the space between it and the superior lateral stripe is lined, and the head and labial plates are spotted, both characters of the Z. teniatus. Cat. No. 1974 has a trace of the inferior stripe on the middle third of the length, while the superior stripe extends on the anterior two-thirds. The coloration of the head is exactly that of the Z. schottii. It may indicate a subspecies of this species.

The sixth labial scarcely touches the postorbital, in one specimen being Separated by a small plate. The loreal is elongated, lower than in Z. flagellum. Labials, eight above, penultimate largest; nine or ten below, the fifth largest. Rostral broader than high, the reverse being the case in Z. flagellum. Dorsal rows of scales, fifteen. The scales are broad, very large, thin, and perfectly smooth. The edges are nearly straight, tip truncated and rounded off. They are decidedly broader than in Z, flagellum.

skin between the scales dark, beneath yellowish, blotched with black; anteriorly the blotches are in the form of two quite contiguous rows of broad, mottled spots, which become broken posteriorly, and overspread the abdomen; anteriorly these are dark brown, posteriorly they are lighter and tinged with red; the tail is immaculate, reddish white. A narrow yellow line along the contiguous edges of the abdomen and outer dorsal rows. The fourth row of scales with the adjacent edges of the third and fifth, are yellowish white, with a well-defined black line through the center of the former. Down the center of all the rows as well as the fourth, is a black line, most intense on the first and third rows. At successive intervals along the back are seen broad, transverse light bands, produced by the obliteration of the black line in the fourth row, and by all the dorsal scales between the light lines being yellowish white, with more or less of purplish black toward the tips. There are about eight of these*dorsal marks on the anterior three-fifths of the body, the first being indicated by a light bar on the nape.

The above specimens are adult. The relative lengths of the tail in ~
two of them are: Cat. No. 1970, two and twelve-thirteenths in total length; Cat. No. 1971, two and nine-tenths in total length.
They differ in coloration only in the degree of paleness of the longitudinal stripes and cross-shades, the colors being less contrasted i in some than in others.
Although this species has the scale formula, and some resemblance in coloration to the Z. teniatus, I can not now refer it to that species. The head is elongate, with narrow protuberant muzzle more like the Z, flagellum and Z. piceus than the Z. teniatus and Z. lateralis. The Z. ornatus displays the unusual peculiarity of a striped species with a tendency to become annulate.

Inferior labials nine, tne fifth the largest. Postgeneials a little larger than pregeneials. Scales in fifteen longitudinal rows, those on the anterior two-thirds of the body elongate, those following, wider.
Baird and Girard give the following scutal formule and measurements, the latter in inches:
Cat. No. 4384, U.S.N.M.
California; gastrosteges, 209 +1; urosteges, 157; total length, 108; tail, 14. I add the following, measurements in millimeters: Provo, Utah; gastrosteges, 207-++1; urosteges, 138; total length, 1100; tail, 337.
A longitudinal dorsal band, six and two half-seales wide, olive-brown, each scale with a rather deeper spot in the center; the four and a half scales on each side of this band yellow, each row with a narrow brown stripe through its center, fading out in the tail. There are thus five dark stripes on each side, the fifth above margining the dorsal band. Of these stripes, the first and third are narrow, each showing a stripe of yellow of the same size on each side of it; the second and third are closer to each other and broader. Beneath yellowish, with a distinet dark stripe on each side, just within the external row of dorsal scales. The seutelle otherwise immaculated, except a few scattered dots

toward the head, exhibiting a tendency to arrangement in two rows. Extreme bases of all the scales black.
The above expresses the condition of specimens of medium age. In young examples the head plates have pale margins, and this character sometimes persists in specimens of considerable size. The dark stripes on the extremities of the gastrosteges is absent in half the specimens. The lines on the middles of the dorsal scales are sometimes wanting, so
that the back is uniform brown. Sometimes the space between the first.
and third rows of scales is darker than that between the latter and the middle of the fifth row, thus imitating the I. laterale, but with thelight stripe thus outlined one row of scales higher up.
The lateral plates from the postoculars forward are yellow with brown borders; the temporals are brown with yellow borders, thus differing from the M. schottii, where they are unicolor. The superior labials have their superior and inferior edges brown bordered or rather blotched, except the eighth, which has the lower edge yellow. Inferior labials and genials marked with black specks or blotches.
A young specimen (Cat. No. 3123) has the tendency to a yellow stripe on the third, fourth, and fifth rows of scales above referred to, well marked. The head shields above have narrow pale margins. The frontal plate is not so narrow posteriorly as in the adult from the same and other localities. Still younger individuals (Cat. Nos. 1982, 11423) have the lateral yellow stripe more distinct by the suffusion of the third, second, and half the first rows with brown, thus producing an appearance much like that of the Z. lateralis. But only the third and fourth rows have the yellow stripe, and the brown band covers the ends of the gastrosteges of that species. It was this resemblance that induced me to combine the two species, with the remark ! “‘the young, of the form lateralis, the adult, the teniatus.”
Measurements.—The measurements of the tail in nine specimens are as follows: Three and one-seventh times in total length, Cat. Nos. 8432 and 4384; three and one-fifth, Cat. Nos. 9520, 8120, and 11422; three and onefos th, Cat. Nos. 13618 and 1979; ties and one-third, Cat. Nos.
8122; three aad one-half, Cat. No. 1983.
The distribution of this elegant snake is throughout the Sonoran region north to Salt Lake and western Colorado, and in the Pacifie north to Baird, Shasta County. I have met with it in the Rio Grande Valley as far south as Laredo, Texas. I observed a specimen strung through the branches of a screw-bean thicket. It eyed me for a time, perfectly protected by the hard spines of the bushes, which prevented
me from seizing it. On being stirred up it moved off ie tre and graceseid = ough the branches.

Salvadora BAIRD and GIRARD, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serpents, 1853, p. 104.— Copg, Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, pp. 57, 72. :
Phimothyra Corr, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 566; Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 38.
Form elongate, head distinct from body. Cephalic plates normal, except rostral shield, which is expanded laterally with more or less free margins, and is recurved on the summit of the muzzle. Two nasals. Preocular divided. Scales smooth bifurcate. Anal and subcaudal scutelle divided. Teeth longer posteriorly. Pupil round.
This genus is more like the Lytorhynchus of Peters of Africa and the adjacent parts of Asia, and like it, inhabits, as to its typical form, the S, grahame, dry and rocky regions. It has the same _ peculiarly expanded rostral plate as the genus Phyllorhynchus Stejneger, and displays a similar tendency to division of the lateral head shields. Three species of Salvadora are known, all of which are found within the political limits of Mexico, and one of them (S. grahami) occurs also in the Sonoran region within the United States.
I proposed! to change the name of this genus, because it had been previously given by Linnzus to a genus of plants. As it is not now regarded as necessary to maintain uniform difference between plant and animal generic names, | have recurred to the name of Baird and Girard.

All of the species have seventeen longitudinal rows of scales. They differ as follows:
I. Tail one-fourth of total length or shorter; superior labial plates eight. Rostral plate wider, more free laterally ; temporal scales 2, 3, 4; bluish or yellowish, with a brown stripe on each side of a yellowish dorsal stripe. S. grahamie Baird and Girard.
Rostral plate narrower, less free laterally; temporal scales 2, 2, 3; olivaceous, -
with two brown stripes on each side of a narrow light brown dorsal stripe. S. bairdii Jan.! Il. Tail one-third total length; superior labial plates, nine.
Rostral plate narrower, less free at the sides; temporal scales 22-2. Yellowish, with two brown bands on each side of a dorsal stripe, anteriorly broken up into parallel narrow lines and crossed by brown crossbars near the head.

produced slightly between the postnasal and the loreal, on the sides of thehead. Frontal subpentagonal, much elongated, tapering posteriorly without being pointed. Parietals elongated, posteriorly truncated, sides rounded. Prenasal larger, subtrapezoidal; postnasal subquadrangular; nostril situated at the anteroposterior angle of the postnasal. Loreal subtriangular, base in a horizontal line with the head; apex upwards produced between the postfrontal and the upper anteorbital. Oculars 2-2 or 3-2. Upper anteorbital large, angular, produced to the upper surface of the head between the superciliaries and postfronta!s. Inferior anteorbitals small and quadrangular, lowest situated on the commissure between the fourth and fifth labials. Postorbitals angular, equal in size. Two pretemporals, shields somewhat larger than rest, which are searcely larger than the scales. Mouthdeeply cleft, undulating. Upper labials eight; seventh largest, the three anterior ones comparatively small. Lower labials not conspicuous, ten in number, fifth largest, the three posterior ones scarcely to be distinguished from the scales. Posterior pair of mental scutella much smaller than the anterior, extending to the middle of the fifth inferior labial. Symphyseal plate very small.
Body subcylindrical, elongated, tail subconical, tapering, forming about the one-fourth of the total length. Scales elliptical, disposed in seventeen rows; outer row somewhat broader, the rest slightly diminishing towards the dorsal region.
Surface of head brown. An ochraceous vitta extends from the occiput to near the end of the tail, embracing anteriorly three rows of scales, and posteriorly one row, and two adjoining halves to opposite the anus; on the tail it covers two half scales. On each side of this a brown vitta runs parallel, and covers the same number of scales anteriorly and posteriorly, except on the tail, where it is narrower, and embraces only half a scale. The anterio-inferior margin of the scales in the black vitta is yellowish green. The remaining portion of the flanks, embracing four rows of scales, and the extremities of the scutellie, is uniform yellowish green, with the bases of the scales blackish, as is also the skin. The abdomen is uniform dull yellow.
Sonora; gastrosteges, 180+ 1; urosteges, 97; total length, 28} inches; tail, 7} inches.
Considerable variations are presented by this species. Thus in four specimens (Cat. Nos. 4673, 4470, 14064, 17175) a narrow brown band extends along the fourth row of scales, in addition to the usual one on each side of the median line. In Cat. Nos. 4470, 2082 the superior Stripe is partially broken into spots. In Cat. No. 9001 the bands are obsolete, being represented by blackish shades at the bases of the scales, Several specimens (Cat. Nos. 2082, 9101, 5347, 12638, 13811, 16339) have a small loreal below the usual one. In five (Cat. Nos. 2082, 4470, 9101, 13811, 16339) a second inferior ocular is formed from the summit of the fourth superior labial plate, so that the fifth only enters the orbit. On a specimen of this kind was proposed the Phimothyra hevalepis,

<<<Page: 845>>>

which has also wider brown dorsal stripes than any other individual. In Cat. Nos. 13811, 16339, and 17175 there are nine superior labials.
The S. bairdi resembles this species considerably, but has the rostral plate much narrower, and with more closely appressed edges, quite as the S. mexicana. One or more of the temporal scales of the inferior row is larger than in the S. grahamice. The colors are darker. The S. mexicana is a larger species than either of the others, and its general appearance is a mixture of the Zamenis teniatus and the Z. flagelliformis. The head is longer and flatter than the other species, and the temporal __ scales are in four vertical rows, the upper row larger.
The Salvadora grahamie ranges from Guyamas, Sonora (Cragin), Batopilas, Chihuahua (WaT oS, and Cape St. Lucas (Xantus), on the south, to Cottonwoad Canyon, Utah, onthenorth. The locality given on the authority of Yarrow, ‘“‘ Ogden, Utah,” i in the following list, requires confirmation, as it is much further north than it is to be looked for.

PHYLLORHYNCHUS Stejneger. Phyllorhynchus STEJNEGER, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XIII, 1890, p. 151.
Head slightly distinct, short; tail short; palatine teeth present; dentition diacranterian; rostral plate greatly enlarged, with free lateral borders, and produced backward so as to separate the supranasals entirely; anal undivided; no scale pits; pupil vertical; two nasals; loreal present; supralabials not in contact with orbit; one pair of geneials only.
This genus is a curious example of those snakes in which the rostral shows a most extraordinary development. In the present instance this shield resembles a thick leaf loosely attached to the front of the snout and turned over on top of the muzzle. It approaches very closely the Lytorhynchus Peters of the desert regions of North Africa and India, differing only in the greater posterior prolongation of the rostral shield. Two species are known, both from the Sonoran region. They differ as follows:
Scales keeled on posterior two-thirds of body; tail one-eighth of total length; about
fifteen dorsal and no lateral spots -. ........-...---.--------Ph. browni Stejneger. Scales all smooth; tail shorter, about one twelfth the length; about thirty dorsal spots and one or two rows of lateral spots ..............---..Ph. decurtatus Cope.

Rostral very prominent and broad, recurved on the top of the snout so as to separate the supranasals entirely and the prefrontals partially, with free lateral edges which are rather sharp and thin; lower side of rostral deeply concave; two prefrontals; frontal large, hexagonal, as broad as long; parietals scarcely longer than frontal, their width equaling their length; at their posterior border a broad but very short shield

<<<Page: 847>>>

with a median groove in continuation of the interparietal suture; nostril large, opening between the two large nasals and overhung by the prominent lower edge of the supranasal; the Icreal proper high and narrow, surmounted by a small supraloreal which joins the supranasal, the upper preorbitals, and the prefrontals, being a detached portion of the latter; between the loreal proper and the supralabials two small subloreals; three preoculars, upper largest and not in contact with the frontal; two suboculars; four postoculars; three anterior temporals, upper largest; six supralabials, the two posterior largest (on the left side a narrow portion ef the last is divided off anteriorly by a vertical suture not shown in the figure), none in contact with orbit; nine infralabials, the first five largest; mental triangular, with two well-defined concavities on the anterior border; only one pair of large, broad geneial shields, with a straight anterior border joined in its whole length by the posterior border of the first infralabials, the lower border of the second infralabial only meeting the lateral border of the geneial; a small scale wedged in’ between the geneial and the fourth and fifth infralabials probably represents the second pair of geneials. Scales

nearly equal, in nineteen rows, those on the anterior third of the body nearly smooth, but becoming gradually more distinctly keeled posteriorly; gasterosteges, one hundred and fifty-nine; anal entire; urosteges, thirty-one pairs. Tail rather blunt.
Dimensions.—Total length, 325 mm.; length of tail from anus, 42 mm. ; proportion of tail to total length = 1:7.75.
Coloration (in alcohol).—White, with fifteen “seal brown” blotches on the back from head to tip of tail, becoming pale posteriorly; the first of these blotches, which begins three scale rows behind the parietals is of a uniform dark color, rather long and nearly hourglass-shaped, its anterior border being concave, and the antero-lateral corners produced to the angle of the mouth, and nearly meeting the posterior ends of a broad line of dark color which runs from the upper posterior labials on one side through the eye across the interorbital space down to the hinder labials on the other side; the other blotches are more or less square with rounded corners, the middle portion being lighter—the dark color only “‘powdered” over the white ground—with dark borders. The anterior and posterior borders wider than the lateral ones, the

white interspaces faintly “‘ powdered” with brown on the sides; hinder supralabials with the posterior margin dark brown; lower surface uniform white.
This species differs in many important points from the previously described Ph. decurtatus, from Lower California. It is of stouter build, with a proportionately longer tail; the dorsal scales are decidedly keeled on the posterior two-thirds of the body, while in Ph. decurtatus they are all smooth; the number of gasterosteges is larger and the urosteges fewer; in Ph. decurtatus the rostral seems to be thicker, and the shields on the sides of the face are fewer; finally, the coloration is very different, Ph. browni having only fifteen dorsal blotches and no lateral spots, against double the number of dorsal blotches and very pronounced lateral spots in Ph. decurtatus.

Rostral as in Ph. browni, but apparently thicker and not produced quite so far backward, as its posterior apex only just touches the suture of the prefrontals; under side of free lateral border of rostral very distinetly folded transversely; two prefrontals; frontal hexagonal, longer than broad; parietals as long as frontal and as long as broad; no shield behind parietals; nostril and nasals as in Ph. browni; loreal rather large, joining the prefrontal above, and meeting (on the right side) the second supralabial and a rather large subloreal below, which is wedged in between third and fourth supralabials, while on the left the upper portion of second supralabial is cut off so as to form a small second subloreal; three preoculars as in Ph. browni; two suboculars; three postoculars; two anterior temporals, on right side upper smallest, on left lower smallest; six supralabials, three posterior largest; infralabials and geneials as in Ph. browni; scales smooth, slightly decreasing in size toward the middle of the back, in nineteen rows; gastrosteges one hundred and seventy-seven; anal entire; urosteges twenty-six pairs.
Dimensions.—Total length, 350 mm.; length of tail from anus, 29 mm. ; proportion of tail to total length=1: 12.
Coloration (in alcohol).—Ground color whitish, with about thirty-two ‘chocolate brown” blotches on the back from neck to tip of tail; shape and size more or less irregular, but usually more or less concave in front and behind, pale in the middle, the brown color being merely sprinkled over the white ground; on the sides a row of smaller brown spots, two or three scales large, in a more or less double series, and, as a rule, alternating with the dorsal blotches; on the head a broad line from above each angle of the mouth running upward and forward through the eyes and meeting on the prefrontals; a few irregular spots on posterior portion of frontal, on parietals and anterior portion of neck, as well as on some of the supralabials; lower surface unspotted.
The above description is derived from the typical specimen, which was brought from the northern part of Lower California by Mr. William M. Gabb, and is preserved in the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
Another specimen is in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 12639), and was collected by Mr. L. Belding at La Paz, near the southern extremity of the peninsula. According to Stejneger this specimen agrees with the type in all essential points. The scutellation is identical with the right side of the type (one subloreal only), except that there are three anterior temporals, lower largest; gastrosteges one hundred and seventy-two; urosteges twenty-seven pairs. ’
Dimensions.—Total length, 300 mm.; tail from anus, 28 mm.; proportion of tail to total length=1:10.7
The coloration is also quite similar, the number of dorsal blotches being twenty-nine.

Colubrid snakes with equal teeth, subeylindric body, and two rows of caudal scutelle. The pupil round; the rostral and nine superior cephalic shields normal; two nasals and one preocular plates. Two pairs of geneials; scales of the body with two apical pits, keeled or rarely, smooth. Preanal shield divided.
This genus embraces a number of species of the northern temperate regions of the world. Six species belong to Eurasia and ten to North America. Three others extend to within the tropics of Mexico and Central America.
The proper application of the Linnean generic name Coluber only appears after considerable criticism of the work of the earlier writers on reptiles. The first author to use the name after Linneus was Laurenti, in 1768, in his Specimen Synopsis Reptilium, published at Vienna. He includes in it ten species, of which eight can be determined. Of these, three are Viperid, one is a crotalid, and four are harmless snakes. All of the venomous and three of the harmless species bear Linnzan names, and all of them are members of the Linnean genus Coluber. It remains to be determined for which of these types the name Coluber of Laurenti must be retained. The evidence is furnished by the author in the following foot-note attached to the generic character:
Colubri venenati absque ulla injuria accepta ferocissime irruunt in hominem.
In the opinion of Laurenti the Colubri were poisonous, and this was probably due to the fact that the only species of his list with which he was acquainted by actual observation were the European vipers he included in it. The poisonous species are then the types of the Coluber of Laurenti.
The next author to use the name Coluber was Treviranus.! He indicated but one species, C. natriz. As this species is the type of the Natrix of Laurenti of 1798, it can not be used in that connection.
Oppel, in his work on Reptilia published in 1811, gave the following species under the genus Coluber:
C. melanocephala Linnzeus. C. natric Linneus.
C. cursor. C. myclerizans Linn:eus. C. esculapit Gmelin, Linnzeus, 1728. C. ibiboca.
C, canus Linnzus. C. cyaneus Linneus,
C. viperinus Linnzeus. C. carinatus Linnieus.
1 Biologie ad Philosophie d. Natur, Géttingen, 1802.

<<<Page: 851>>>

Of these species the O. cursor and OC. ibiboca are not Linnean, and the C. viperinus and C. natrix belong to a genus which had been already established, the Natrix of Laurenti. We are therefore restricted to six species in our search for the type of the genus Coluber. They received generic names at the following dates:
C. melanocephala; Tantilla Baird and Girard, 1853. C. esculapii; Coluber Giinther, 1858.
C. canus; Pseudaspis Cope, 1864.
C. mycterizans; Passerita Gray, 1825.
C. cyaneus; unidentified.
C. carinatus; Herpetudryas Boie, 1826.
Giinther in 1858 selected the C. wsculapii as the type of Coluber, and to this species that generic name must be applied.
Mr. Garman, of Cambridge, has followed Duméril in using the name Coluber for the C. constrictor Linnzus. The way in which this conclusion has been reached is as follows:
The first author whom we have to consider is Fitzinger, whose Neue Classification der Reptilien appeared in June, 1826, in Vienna. Seventy-one species of Coluber are enumerated in this work (page 57), of which only twenty-two are of Linnzan origin, and to these we must therefore confine our attention. In the following list of them the names of the genera to which these species were successively referred is given, and the date of each:

The latest date only can be considered in this connection, since the names of genera are retained in accordance with the priority of date of each. The latest date at which species of this restricted division Coluber are referred to other genera is 1853. In that year four of them
, Paap

<<<Page: 852>>>

were referred to genera distinct from Coluber, and of these genera three were newly established. These three are Bascanium Baird and Girard, Dromicus Bibron, and Haldea Baird and Girard. Now Duméril, who published the prodromous of his classification of the serpents in 1853, expressly retains the name Coluber for the C. constrictor of Linnus, type of Bascaniwm. But as the OC. constrictor is not included in the Oppelian genus Coluber of 1811, it can not be considered here at all.
Shortly after the appearance of the work of Fitzinger, Boie furnished a synopsis of his systematic work on reptiles! He gives a list of thirty-five species of the genus Coluber, of which only six are Linnean. Of these but three appear in the list from Fitzinger, given above. These are C. cyaneus, C. hippocrepis, and C. constrictor, thus restricting the name to the C. constrictor.
Soon after, however, Boie gave a list of the genera of snakes, with a typical species for each.? Here he cites the C. elaphis (Elaphis quaterradiatus Gmelin, Duméril and Bibron) of Europe as the type, and adds “u,v. a,” meaning, und viel andere—species belonging to the genus. What these other species are may be derived from a perusal of a previous paper by Boie,* where he describes three closely allied species from Japan, the whole belonging to the genus Elaphis of Duméril and Bibron, and one of them (Coluber conspicillatus) being a member of the genus Coluber of Giinther. Dr. Giinther has regarded this reference as an indication of the meaning of Boie in his use of the name Coluber, and this determination must stand on the ground of previous determination by Oppel.
The North American species are of inoffensive habits, but are destructive to birds and mammals. Some of them reach considerable dimensions, but they are exceeded in this respect by some of the species of the allied genus Spilotes. The C. guttatus and C. rosaceus are of brilliant colors.
The North American species are closely allied, and form gradations of characters which must be carefully estimated in order to learn the definitions. It is not difficult to distinguish the C. vulpinus, C. guttatus, and C. emoryi, but the group of which the C. spiloides is the type is more difficult to unravel. It embraces that species, C. conjfinis, C. quadrivittatus, C. obsoletus, C. frenatus, and C.letus. All the North American species (except possibly C. confinis, of which but one specimen is known) have twenty-seven rows of scales, some species (C. vulpinus) varying to twenty-five, and others (C. emoryi) varying to twenty-nine. The most important characters are the number of rows of scales which are keeled, and the length of the tail, as indicated by the number of urosteges. The coloration has a typical value, but displays many transitions, especially in the spiloides group.

keels on any of the dorsal series of scales, and in one of C. emoryi a few dorsal rows have faint traces of keels. In a specimen of C. obsoletus (Cat. No. 5503) there are but sixty urosteges, the smallest number known in any other individual being seventy-four. This is abnormal. The young of the C. quadrivittatus are strongly spotted, and closely resemble the C. spiloides, as is also the ease with the young of the C. guttatus. In the young of C. emoryi there are seldom more than two scuta in the first row of temporals, the division into three being accomplished at a later stage of growth. The general result of these facts is that the C. spiloides is the primitive type from which the other species have been derived, some by one modification, some by another. Giinther retained the Linnean name Coluber for this genus, as he was compelled to do in view of the use of it by his predecessors Boie

of 1-2-3 scales on one side, and 12, 3-3 on the other. The first is a wide plate and different in form from what is found in the other species here described. Last superior labial large, nearly as high as the seventh, and little less elevated than the sixth. Postgeneials smaller than pregeneials. Scales in twenty-five rows, rather wide, the first row wider than the others; eleven median rows keeled, mostly quite distinctly.
Ground color (in alcohol) light yellowish, crossed above by thirty subquadrate brown spots, which have in some places very slight traces of a black border anteriorly and posteriorly. The spots are wider than long, except the anterior four spots, which are longer than wide. There is a series of rounded brown spots on the sides alternating with these, of which the anterior form are longer than deep, the first forming a short band. A very obscure series of spots on the ends of the gastrosteges alternates with the lateral spots. Toward the posterior part of the belly these become confluent, forming a dusky band on the upturned extremities of the gastrosteges, as in the C. obsoletus, and they form two— parallel bands on the under side of the tail, a character more or less visible in other species. The nuchal dorsal spot sends anteriorly and posteriorly from its angles short bands, the anterior not reaching the parietal plate. There are no markings on any part of the head, which is of a uniform yellowish gray above, and cream color below and on the superior borders of the mouth.
When the skin of the upper surfaces is stretched, the dark color of the spots is seen not to cover the entire surface of each scale, forming longitudinal stripes, which are distinctly indicated in the spaces between the spots.

This species resembles in color characters the O. spiloides, but is in its scutellation different from any other American species. The contracted muzzle with small rostral plate, and the very small loreal, together with the large temporals, are especial characters.
It is not absolutely certain that this is the C. confinis of Baird and Girard, the type specimen of which I have not been able to find. The description of those authors agrees with it in the number of rows of scales, and does not differ in any important respect from it. It was taken at Anderson, South Carolina.

Ground color above light-brown. A series of broad transverse quadrate chocolate blotches extending from head to tail, about sixty in number, forty-four to anus. The first spot anteriorly is divided into two on
» the nape, and occasionally the blotches anteriorly are irregular, oblique, and varying in size. This occurs, however, only on the anterior fifth of the body, behind which the intervals between the blotches are rectilinear, nearly equal, and about one and a half scales in length. The blotches are generally embraced between the fifth or sixth rows on each side, and are three to four scales long. The sides of the blotches are not linear, but obtuse-angled. On each side is a series of smaller rounded blotches on the 3d to 7th rows similar in color to those on the back, and like them with a black border, sometimes more or less interrupted. Another series of subquadrate black blotches, about the same

size as the last, is visible on the edge of the abdomen, sometimes involying the first and second rows of scales; these are opposite to the dorsal blotches. Rest of the abdomen yellowish-white, with alternating quad. rate blotches of black. The brown color becomes lighter on the sides.
A second much larger specimen from Michigan has the ground color a yellowish-brown, and there is a black streak from the eye to the angle of the mouth; a second vertical stripe under the eye. The spots on the back are only about forty-five, of which thirteen belong to the tail.
This is the most robust species of the genus, and it reaches as large a size as any. [Every character is consistent. The head is short, the parietal plates are short, the body is short, the tail is short, and the spots are short relatively to the other species of the genus.

The fox snake appears to be moderately common in some localities. It is often known as the “pilot snake,” and is supposed to have some mysterious connection with the rattlesnake. It is a wholly innocent snake, although it seems a little inclined to be pugnacious. Dr. Suckley? states that one of these snakes was brought to him alive at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. When provoked it showed its irritation by vibrating the tip of its slender tail, which, whén striking a crumpled leaf or any other small object, would produce a well-marked rattling noise, very similar to that made by the rattlesnake under the same circumstances. Other observers make mention of the same habit.
Mr. Robert Ridgway, of the Smithsonian Institution, writes me that, while hunting near Mount Carmel, Illinois, he came upon a fox snake over six feet in length. It immediately showed a disposition to fight, and Mr. Ridgway says it was the most

; viciously disposed snake that he had ever seen. An examination of the stomach showed that it had just swallowed a half-grown rabbit. Its disposition appears to be in strong contrast to that of C. obsoletus, which, so far as I have been able to learn, is very gentle.
These snakes, being wholly harmless and subsisting on vermin of various kinds, ought to receive the protection of the farmer.

Two plates in the first row of temporals; parietal plate longer than muzzle measured from front of frontal plate. Scales in twenty-seven or twenty-nine rows, only five rows of scales, and these weakly. Eight superior labials, fourth and fifth entering orbit. Orbitals 1-2. Tail short, the scutellie not exceeding seventy-one in number; gastrosteges 215 to 235.

Scales in 29 rows; head bands, excepting the postocular, wanting or rudimental; dorsal spots wider, covering 19-21 rows of scales; no lateral spots---.C. g. sellatus.
This species ranges the Austroriparian region east of the Mississippi River, and the Carolinian district of the Eastern, not, however, entering New Jersey. The subspecies C. y. sellatus is restricted to Florida. It is one of our most brilliantly colored species, and is of inoffensive manners. It is altogether terrestrial in its habits.

each other. Parietals rather narrow, longer than muzzle from frontal. 4 x Eye moderate; center rather in advance of junction of fourth and fifth labials; orbit above the whole of these labials. Labials eight above, penultimate the largest; eleven below.
Body elongated, little compressed. Tail shorter than in any species, except C. vulpinus. .Carination very obsolete, visible only on the five central rows, and there very indistinctly; not evident on the tail. Seales rather large, triangular, pointed, the exterior row little if any larger than the rest.
General color of body above light red, paler on the sides. Along the back a series of dorsal blotches, about forty-five in number, thirty-two from head to anus. These blotches anteriorly are longitudinally quadrate, gradually becoming transverse; in front they are concave beforé and behind, and with the corners produced longitudinally; exteriorly they are zigzag convex. The color of each blotch is a dark brick-red,

with a deep black margin half a scale wide. Exterior to the black is a lighter shade of the ground color. On each side of the dorsal series is a second alternating one of smaller elongated blotches, similarly constituted as to color. <A third opposite to the dorsal occurs on the edge of the abdomen, and on the first to the fourth row of scales; in this the red is lighter, and the black is confined to a few scattered seales. The lateral blotches are more or less indistinct in places, and frequently confluent with each other and the dorsal series. Posteriorly, too, they are reduced more or less to the black marks in single scales. Color beneath yellowish-white, with subquadrangular blotches of black, generally occupying half of the inferior surface of the abdominal scutell. }
The ground color of the sides extends up on the forehead in the form of a frontlet, which crosses the vertical at its anterior extremity, passes backward along the top of the head, including the superciliaries and outside of occipitals, crosses above the angle of the mouth, and runs into the sides of the neck. This is narrowly margined on both edges

with black. A second frontlet across the front of the postfrontals, narrower but similar, and bending down on each side to the anteorbital. A similarly colored blotch on the commissure of the occipitals, widening behind and constituting a center to the dark-red space inclosed by the large frontlet on the back of the neck; behind the one just mentioned is another rather larger, and the two are sometimes confluent. A dark-red stripe is included between the two frontlets just described, crossing the posterior part of the postfrontals, the upper end of the anterior frontals, and through the eye, across the angle of the mouth down the sides of the neck. Vertical edges of the upper and lower labials black.
Specimens from Kemper County, Mississippi, much larger in size, agree exactly in the pattern of coloration. The red is, however, more or less effaced, probably by the alcohol. The blotches are light hazel, and the interspaces light chocolate.
Smaller specimens from Georgia differ only in fein the blotches dark hazel, lighter centrally. The intervals are ash gray.

836 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1898. COLUBER GUTTATUS SELLATUS Cope.
Coluber guttatus sellatus Coprn, Proc. U.S, Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 387.
This subspecies Goes not differ in any structural character from the typical C. guttatus guttatus, excepting that the scales are in twenty-nine longitudinal rows. The value of this point is uncertain, as but three specimens are known. The essential differences are seen in the color. The headbands so conspicuous in the C. g. guttatus are wanting here, except the postocular, which is present, and is black-banded above and below. The parietal band is indicated by a black external border, which extends to the edge of the parietal plate. It is further faintly indicated by a shade, which joins that of the opposite side, on the front of the frontal scutum. A second character is seen in the absence of lateral spots on the body, their places being clear pink or yellowish, like
Fig. 190. COLUBER GUTTATUS SELLATUS COPE. —— |e Palatka, Florida. Cat. No. 6507, U.S.N.M.
the ground of the belly. The spaces between the dorsal spots and those between the lateral clear spaces are gray dusted. The scales at the superior edge of the lateral pale spots are sometimes black-bordered, partially outlining a lateral spot. This is most distinct anteriorly, where these borders form interrupted longitudinal lines. The dorsal spots are ‘red and have narrow serrate black anterior and posterior borders. The spots are wider than in the C. 9. guttatus, covering nineteen and twentyone longitudinal rows of scales, while in the former they cover but from ten to fifteen rows of scales. The belly is tesselated with black spots, as in C. gy. guttatus, each spot covering the external half of two or three gastrosteges. A delicate black line connects them externally, running along the angle of the gastrosteges.

allied species, as broad as it is long, with straight anterior border. Parietals longer than muzzle from frontal plate. Loreal longer than high; preocular not reaching frontal, but separated by the very narrow anterior extremity of the superciliary. Temporals 2-3-4, the posterior small. Scales of body smooth, rather wide, the first row a little wider than the second. Postgeneials smaller than pregeneials, but distinct from gular scales. Gastrosteges bent up at the sides. Tail probably long as in C. quadrivittatus, but the end is lost. The urosteges remaining number 47.
The ground color of the superior surfaces, in the rather fresh alcoholic specimen, is buff, each scale with a dusky band within and parallel to the border, surrounding a buff center. This band may be broken up into spots. The greater part of the superior surfaces is occupied by a series of vermilion-tinted pink spots, which extend across the back to within two or three scales of the gastrosteges, thus

covering from twenty-one to twenty-three scales transversely. Their length covers six scales everywhere, though as the scales are more elongate anteriorly the spots are also more elongate. The lateral spots of other species are represented by pale tracts continuous with the light yellow of the belly, which alternate with the dorsal spots, extending to an apex on the fourth or fifth row. In other words the cross bands of dusky ground-color bifurcate on the flanks, and terminate at the extremities of the gastrosteges. Below their termini at the lateral angle of the gastrosteges is a short longitudinal black bar or spot crossing one or two gastrosteges. This represents the black line which occupies a similar position in the C. guttatus. At the anterior and posterior parts of the body the dorsal spots have shert serrate anterior and posterior borders.
Four indistinct longitudinal bands traverse the length of the body on the fourth and fifth and tenth and eleventh rows of scales on each side. The inferior band is very obscure, especially anteriorly, and both are less distinct on the true skin than on the epidermis.
The head is of a reddish color above; below, yellowish. A faint dusky band extends across the temporal region and parts of the superciliary and frontal plates, meeting a corresponding one of the opposite side. This represents the space between the bands of the C. guttatus, which consist in this species of ground color only. Superior and posterior margins of upper labials obscurely dusky.
Cat. No. 14418; gastrosteges, 239-++-1; urosteges, (?); scales, 27; totallength, 970mm.
This beautiful species is of considerable interest from the intermediate position it occupies between the C. guttatus and the C. quadrivittatus. The absence of keels of the scales and the dorsal color spots ally it to the former, and especially to the subspecies C. g. sellatus; but the absence of lateral and ventral spots and head bands and presence of longitudinal stripes ally it to the latter. The width of the frontal plate is also characteristic. It is a very handsome animal.

Eyes large. Frontal plate pentagonal, slightly concave on the sides, equalling in length vhe commissure of the parietals. The lower portion of the anterior orbital is narrower than in S.l@tus. Loreal trapezoidal. Two elongated and small temporal shields in the first row. Upper labials eight, seventh largest; lower labials ten, fifth largest. Rostral hexagonal. Scales very thin, lozenge-shaped, in twenty-seven dorsal rows. Slight traces of carination may be observed on the five or eight medial rows. The outer row is composed of scales as high as long; in the second row they are perceptibly larger than the remaining ones. Ground-color above creamy yellow to brownish gray, with four longitudinal brown bands, covering each one entire row of scales and the half of the adjoining rows. The lateral bands thus extend along the

third, fourth, and fifth rows, the fourth being tne one entirely covered. The dorsal bands extend along the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth rows, the eleventh being entirely covered. The space between the dorsal and lateral band embraces four entire rows of scales, and the half of the adjoining ones. The dorsal space between the dorsal bands comprises three entire rows of scales and the half of the adjoining rows. The abdomen, head, and tail beneath are light straw-color with obscure traces of gray spots. On the removal of the epidermis the dark bands disappear to a considerable extent, and then indistinct and obsolete quadrate spots become visible on the sides, and on the back, the latter occupying the space between the median pair of bands. The edges of many of the scales are lighter.
These spots are distinct in young specimens, and disappear with advancing maturity.

An instructive series of the young of this species was sent to the U.S. National Museum by William Wittfield from Georgiana, Brevard County, Florida. They number nineteen specimens, and show how a longitudinally banded snake is developed from a spotted one. The specimens may be divided into three lots, the first including Cat. Nos. 13650, 13652, 13668, 13669, 13678, 13689, 13696, and 13706. These are the smaller specimens, the smallest measuring 525 mm., and the largest 380 mm. The dorsal region is marked with brown spots on a light ground, and there is a series of smaller spots alternating with them on each side, with a trace of a second series of spots alternating with the last on the ends of the gastrosteges. The dorsal spots have concave anterior and posterior borders, so that the angles of one spot approximate those of the adjacent ones. There are forty-two spots between the nape and vent. The angles of the nuchal spot are produced so as to form short bands, the anterior reaching to near the parietal scuta. There is a narrow brown postocular band, and a narrow one across the front on the posterior part of the prefrontal plates. The lateral spots of the body are elongate in front, the first forming a longitudinal line on the side of the neck. The gastrosteges are spotted at the ends, and the middle portions are clouded in some of the specimens.
In this stage these specimens are closely similar to the C. spiloides, except that the spots in the latter species are less numerous, ranging from 30 to 35 on the body. They can not be distinguished by the increased number of keeled rows of scales, as the keels are less evident in the young than in the adult.
The second set of specimens measure from 460 to 580 mm., and embraces Cat. Nos. 13646, 13657, 13681, 13703. Here the lateral angles of the dorsal spots are connected by a faint longitudinal stripe, thus forming the superior pair of stripes of the adult; and the lateral spots show a trace of a similar connection on the anterior part of the body. ‘The marks on the head are present as in the smaller specimens, or they are broken into spots or are nearly absent. The clouded marks of the belly are present or absent.
The third set varies from 580 to 620 mm., and includes Cat. Nos. 13656, 13670, 13675, 13686, 13691. Here the lateral stripe is fairly distinet, and the head and belly are immaculate. Traces of the dorsal and lateral spots may be distinctly seen. ,

<<<Page: 866>>>

Associated with these specimens from the same locality is a young 0. guttatus of 550 mm. length. It displayed all the characters of the adult, and does not vary in the direction of the C. spiloides, as do the young of the present species.

eye, and the edges of the labials in front also black. Some blotching on the top of the head, which is too indistinct to define and is sometimes entirely wanting.
Compared with S. vulpinus the eyes are larger, the parietal plates longer, the nostrils more anterior, the carination more obsolete. Body more elongated. Abdominal scutelle more numerous. Spots longitudinal, not transverse. Seales shorter, broader, more obtusely angular.
This species is closely allied to S. guttatus, but is quite distinct. Its full characters can best be seen in larger specimens; the young are more easily confounded with those of S. guttatus.

In young specimens of this species (as Cat. Nos. 8981, 14094) the keels of the scales are very obscure, or absolutely wanting, even up to a length of 430 mm. (Cat. No. 14094, Texas). The brown prefrontaland postocular bands are also very distinct, but there is no trace of the parietals. With increasing age the marks become obscure, or disappear altogether, and the abdominal spots become less distinct. Apart from the wide head and compressed neck and body, the young of the C. spiloides can only be distinguished from that of the C. quadrivittatus, by the greater strength of the colors and the smaller number of the dorsal and lateral spots in the former.
The number of temporal scales varies much in the C. spiloides. There are usually three vertical rows, but sometimes there are four, and even five. In the latter case a large scale of the labial or parietal border covers two rows.
The habitat of this species is the entire Austroriparian subregion.

Mr. Morris Gibbs sent me a specimen from Kalamazoo, Michigan, which is the most northern locality known.
Professor Hay ' thinks that this species is a color form of the C. obsoletus. He bases this conclusion on the spotted coloration of the young of the latter, but I do not find this to be a valid argument. The young of C. quadrivittatus are spotted much as in the C. spiloides and some C. obsoletus. The range of the C. spiloides is less extensive than that of the C. obsoletus, which includes the Eastern subregion.
This is the only one of our North American snakes which displays the compressed body which is not uncommon in the Colubrine snakes of the tropics. This character distinguishes it from the other members of the genus found within our limits, but is shared by the C. triaspis Cope, of the Central American fauna. This peculiarity implies more or less climbing habits, and I suspect that when the C. spiloides is better known it will be found to climb on bushes and low trees.

Two plates in the first row of temporals; eight superior labial plates. Parietal plate longer than, or equal to, length of muzzle from front of frontal plate. Scales generally in twenty-seven rows, seventeen rows keeled; tail long, scutelle not exceeding ninety-two; gastrosteges from about two hundred and thirty to two hundred and forty-five.
Black or brown above, with or without darker subquadrate spots; head not banded; belly very darkly clouded.
This somewhat variable species is represented by two subspecific forms, one of which shows affinity to the C. quadrivittatus. They differ as follows:

This species ranges throughout the entire Austroriparian region from the Rio Grande, and the Eastern, excepting only the Hudsonian district. The form C. o. lemniscatus is restricted to the Gulf States, but the C. 0. obsoletus extends as far north as Mount Tom, Massachusetts, on the Connecticut River, according to Dr. J. A. Allen. Dr. Holbrook records it from the Highlands of the Hudson River, New York. Professor Verrill does not enumerate it among the species taken near Norway, Maine. :
This species is not rare in the Middle States. It is, like other members of the genus, of very inoffensive habits, and is useful in reducing the numbers of the small Mammalia. It is much less active than the Zamenis constrictor, which it resembles in nothing but color. It is known as the Mountain Black Snake, or Pilot Snake.
COLUBER OBSOLETUS OBSOLETUS': Say.
Parietals moderate, their commissure equal in length to the frontal. Orbits moderate, above the fourth and fifth labials, center about midway between the snout and angle of the mouth. Anterior orbital large, extending nearly to the outer angle of the vertical. Loreal trape-

zoidal, highest anteriorly, nasals moderate. lLabials eight above, moderate, posterior small, twelve below; posterior very small, sixth and seventh largest. Nine rows of scales between labials and abdominal scutellee at the angle of the mouth. Outer three to seven rows smooth, then carinated very obsoletely, and then more decidedly and in increasing degree toward the back.
Color above black or dark lead color, marked by a dorsal series of
quadrangular blotches, about thirty-four from head to anus, rather acutely emarginate before and behind, occupying a width equal to about fifteen seales. The lozenge-shaped intervals between these blotches are from two to three scales long centrally, diminishing and becoming more linear posteriorly. On each side, and alternating with the dorsal series is a second alternating one, composed of subrectangular elongated blotches, and alternating again with these is a second indistinct series along the edge of the abdomen. The entire system df coloration is _very difficult to define, the general appearance being that of a blacksnake with irregular obsolete mottlings of white. The intervals between the blotches may be indicated as being white, with the center and apex of eae each seale lead color, the proCOLUBER OBSOLETUS OBSOLETUS SAY. portion of the latter being ates Ea ht very small on the sides and Eat No: 1660, SNE increasing to the dorsal line. The scales in the centers of the blotches have the basal half narrowly margined with white, as is the case, to some extent, with the lateral spots. Beneath greenish-white, with the centers of the scutelle mottled with dark slate-blue, increasing backward. Chin and throat immaculate yellowish-white, scales on the sides with a bluish spot on the apex.
The colors described are those as preserved in alcohol. The color of the animal when alive is, at least in individuals from west of the Mississippi and Texas, red in the markings, which are white in spirits.

<<<Page: 871>>>

In the general obsoleteness of the markings the blotches may some-
times be detected as more or less confluent between the different series. _ In two other specimens, Cat. Nos. 10578, 10651, the belly is nearly —
uniform yellowish; the black of the upper parts is replaced by umberbrown. The blotches are visible, but very obsoletely.

This species shares with the C. vulpinus the distinction of reaching a
larger size than any other member of the genus. This species is found over the entire Eastern district of the United States. It is gentle in its disposition and sluggish in its movements. In the few specimens in which the lateral spots may be discriminated they are seen to be of elongate form, with few exceptions (such as Cat.
No. 2421, Louisiana). In some specimens they are so elongate as to —
form a narrow lateral band for a short distance anteriorly, as in two specimens from Wheatland, Indiana (Cat. Nos. 10578, 10651). Such forms prepare us for the subspecies C. 0. lemniscatus. In the Texan specimens, referred to a distinct species under the name of S. lindheimeri, the ground color is lighter, and the spots are distinct and square, and do not form bands on the neck. I can not see that it is more than a variety. This is the ** pilot snake” of the Allegheny mountaineers.

It is of an inoffensive disposition and may be handled with impunity. The following observations concerning C. obsoletus obsoletus are made by Prot. O. P. Hay: !
Of the Colubers I have been able to make observations on C. 0. obsoletus alone. It is likely that others have observed and written on the subject, but I have not met with their statements. Dr. G. B. Goode reckons? this species among those which are ovoviviparous, but I am inclined to question this. My son, W. P. Hay, captured two of these snakes near Indianapolis while they were in sexual union. This was on June 19. The male (Cat. No. 17948, U.S.N.M.), was 5 feet 5 inches long, the female (Cat. No. 17949, U.S.N.M.), 6 feet 3 inches. When they were separated, the intromittent organs of the male were everted some 3 inches. <A dissection shows that the hollow portion of the organ extends behind the vent 3 inches, while the retractor muscles form a cord which extends back nearly to the tip of the tail. On opening the female I find in her sixteen eggs. Of these eggs four lie about in the middle of the reptile’s body, while the other twelve occupy a much more anterior position, the one farthest forward being within 8 inches of the snake’s snout, the hindermost one only 9 inches farther back. Several of these eggs are lying apparently loose in the body cavity. It might be supposed that they had just left the ovary and were about to enter the oviduct; but they are surrounded each with a covering nearly as thick and tough as that of the Heterodon. Could these eggs have been in the oviducts and then squeezed out into the body cavity during the time of being entwined with the male?
I have had an opportunity of dissecting a recently captured female, the length of which was 4 feet 4 inches. The ovaries lie in the region situated about two-thirds the distance from the head to the vent. Each oviduct ends close to the corresponding ovary. It seems evident, therefore, that at least some of the eggs of the specimen described above are really lying loose in the body cavity. In the specimen dissected the ovarian eggs are very immature, none of them exceeding about a quarter of aninch in length. It may be of some interest to add that this female had the anterior three-fourths of the body ornamented with blotches of a decided red color, the red occupying both the surfaces of the scales and the skin between them. The blotches were separated by scales, which were partly yellow. Soon after death a great part of the red disappeared. The stomach contained eight wild mice, six of them young.

Dr. Stejneger adds the following note in the same publication: !
“ ¥7 we ee
Iam able to state that Coluber obsoletus obsoletus is oviparous. Mr. Thomas Mar-—
ron, of the National Museum, early in April, 1889, collected a number of snake eggs
in a hollow stump near the Potomac River. They were opened and found to contain |
fully developed young of this species. (Cat. No. 15334, U.S.N.M.)
Prof. O. P. Hay? gives the following further account of the habits of |
this species:
Coluber obsoletus spends its time in hiding about hollow logs and in holes about
standing trees. It often ascends trees in search of birds and their young. Mr. A. W. Butler, of Brookville, Indiana, says they are the most destructive to birds of all our snakes. Besides birds, they no doubt prey on mice, rats, rabbits, and other small animals. The disposition of this serpent is gentle, and it makes little resistance when surprised and seized by head and tail. It will open its mouth in an attempt to bite, but struggles little. Under such circumstances a Racer would make a lively
disturbance. One put into a box with a mouse would strike at the latter whenever _
it showed too much familiarity, but it was not harmed. In the stomach of one individualI found a number of young mice; in another were two old and six young mice.
This species probably reaches a greater size than any other snake that we have. Mr. Robert Ridgway tells me that he killed one at Mount Carmel, Illinois, which he estimated to be over 9 feet long. It made no resistance when attacked, and was as easily killed as an ordinary snake 2 or 3 feet long. This species has the habit, common to many snakes, of vibrating its tail so as to make a rattling or whirring sound. This probably serves to warn the larger animals of its presence so that they may avoid it.
Dr. G. B. Goode includes this snake among those which are said to “swallow” their young; that is, when danger threatens they open their mouths in order to allow the young to pass down the mother’s throat for safety. More observations need to be made on this point.
I have been able to find in print no observations on the breeding habits of this snake. When and where are the eggs laid? How many of these are there? How soon do they hatch? These are a few of the things that many a farmer’s boy might be able to find out for us. Two individuals were taken at Fall Creek, Marion County,
while in sexual union. This was on June 19. The male was 5 feet 3 inches long;
the female was 6 feet 3 inches. The female contained sixteen eggs. They have a thick covering and must be laid before hatching. Professor Blatchley writes® that he kept one, 5 feet 7 inches long, for some time in confinement. It would on being disturbed vibrate its tail in such a way as to make arattling sound. When
theroom was entered at night with a lamp the snake would hiss with a loud, gurgling
noise. A large horned owl kept in thesame room was attacked by the snake, tightly enveloped in its coils, and so badly crushed that it soon died.
Maximilian + has confirmed the popular notion that the snake will eat fowls’ eggs. One entered his room, climbed to a vessel of eggs, and swallowed a number of them. After the eggs had passed down the throat the shells were crushed by a powerful constriction of the walls of the stomach.
The relative sluggishness of this snake probably accounts for its rarity as compared with the black racer (Z. constrictor) in the more settled portions of the United States.

COLUBER OBSOLETUS LEMNISCATUS Cope. Coluber obsoletus lemniscatus CopPE, Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., 1888, p. 386.
This subspecies agrees with the C. obsoletus obsoletus in the number of ils urosteges and the number of rows of scales that are keeled. It presents in the typical specimen the probable anomaly of three temporals of the first row, like a specimen of the C. 0. obsoletus from Texas. The characters which distinguish this one from the typical form are exclusively those of coloration,
The ground color above is a light brown. This is marked on the body by thirty-one nearly square or longitudinally oblong dark-brown spots, which are, like those of half-grown individuals of the C. cuadrivittatus.
Fig. 195. COLUBER OBSOLETUS LEMNISCATUS COPE =e Whittield County, Georgia. Cat. No, 4710, U.S.N.M.
connected at the angles by a longitudinal stripe on each side. The sides are marked by a wide, brown, longitudinal band which extends from the neck to the anus over a width of from four to six scales, including the first on each side. Belly yellow, tessellated with square, black spots, which become confused on the middle of the length, and finally blend in a nearly unbroken blackish brown, which extends to the end of the tail. Head brown, without markings, except a faint postocular band. Superior labials, with narrow, brown borders; inferior the same, but less distinct. Gular region uniform yellow.
Cat. No. 4710; gastrosteges, 2464-1; urosteges, 75; scales, 27; total length, 936mm. ; tail, 218 mm.
These specimens and another one in my private collection from Mobile, Alabama, are distinctly four banded, as in the (. quadrivittatus; but
NAT MUS 98 o4

<<<Page: 875>>>

they differ from that species in celoration in the much greater width of the lateral band and in the dark coloration of the abdomen. Although the scale characters of the C. 0. lemniscatus are those of the C. obsoletus obsoletus, it might be regarded as a distinct species from it were it not for the intermediate characters presented by two other individuals— one ‘from Georgia (Cat. No. 8798, U.S.N.M.), and one from Mobile, Ala. | bama. In these serpents the longitudinal bands are present, but the lateral shows distinct traces of the spots of the ordinary form, which are, indeed, separated from each other at the middle of the length, thus interrupting the band for a short distance. The postocular band is more distinet. Dorsal spots thirty.

This form is intermediate between the C. quadrivittatus and the 0. obsoletus. The lateral band is much wider than that of the former species. A specimen was sent me from Mobile, Alabama, by Dr. Joseph Corson, United States Army, and it is therefore probably found in Florida, though it has not yet been actually obtained there. A second specimen is in the U.S. National Museum from Whitfield County, in northern Georgia. Two other specimens—one from Mobile and one from Georgia—show the lateral bands interrupted into spots posteriorly, and hence connect with the C. 0. spiloides Duméril and Bibron (C. 0. confinis Baird and Girard, Cope, formerly).

Although known to me from but one specimen, this species must be regarded as distinct, occupying a position between the C. spiloides and the C. emoryi.
The head is but little distinguished from the body, which is cylindric and not compressed. The muzzle is rather narrow, and the rostral plate is also rather narrow, and the frontal is a little longer than wide. The supraorbitals are abruptly narrowed in front, and the parietals are rather small, although longer than the muzzle from the frontal plate. The loreal is well developed, and the two postoculars are subequal. ‘emporals 3-4-5, the third row extending from the posterior side of

the last (eighth) superior labial. The sixth and seventh superior labials are of equal elevation, and a little higher than the eighth. Inferior labials 14. Postgeneials much smaller than pregeneials. Scales in 29 rows; the fifteen median rows keeled, most of them distinctly. First row a little larger than second.
The ground color is brown, and it is crossed on the back (in the typical specimen) by 29 spots anterior to the vent, which have rounded angles and are of a dark brown color, with darker borders, and these again with paler borders on the median dorsal region. These spots are wider than long except the three or four anterior ones. They alternate with large brown spots on the sides, which are elongate antero-posteriorly on the anterior part of the body. Each one corresponds to two smaller, very indistinct spots below it on the ends of

the gastrosteges, which are, on the posterior two-thirds of the body, confluent into a dusky band. These bands continued on the inferior side of the tail. The abdomen is unspotted anteriorly, but near the middle has traces of spots on each side, which are soon lost in a general cloudiness, bounded by a light streak on each side, at the position of the angle of the gastrosteges.
On each side of the nape is a dusky band which extends forward across the external border of the parietal plate, over the entire supra. orbital plate, and crosses to meet that of the opposite side, involving the entire prefrontal plates except the anterior border. A similar band connects the lateral bands across the posterior part of the frontal plate. No postocular band nor labial borders, but the yellow of the superior labial plates is bounded above by the border of the dark color of the

<<<Page: 877>>>

temporal regions, which extend from the orbit to the inferior posterior angle of the seventh superior labial. Throat immaculate, yellowish.
Cat. No. 2257; gastrosteges, 244-+1; urosteges, 77; scales, 29; total length, 708 mm.; tail, 143 mm.
This species resembles in general the C. spiloides, but there are important differences. Besides the increased number of the temporal scales the form of the head and body are different; the head being less distinct and the body not compressed, and there are more of the dorsal scales keeled. The dorsal spots show none of the produced angles of the C. spiloides. The continuation of the nuchal bands over the supraorbital shields to the prefrontals is peculiar to this species, since in all the other banded species the nuchal bands unite on the middle line of the frontal, or parietals, and the prefrontal band is in line with the postocular. Here there is no postocular.

I have not been able to find the type of Baird and Girard, which may be lost. The specimen above described agrees with it in essential particulars except in the number of gastrosteges, which number in the type 227. The latter is from a locality not far from that of the present animal, viz, the Red River in Arkansas.

Plates and shape of head much as in C. guttatus. Three well-developed scales in the first row of temporals. Frontal plate more elongated than in the species of allied color, being decidedly longer than broad. Head rather narrow. Eye larger than in C. guttatus, its center a little posterior to the junction of the fourth and fifth labials. Postorbitals resting on the fifth labial, as in the other species. Anteorbital large. Loreal elongated, acute angled behind. Upper labials eight, sixth and seventh largest; lower eleven, sixth largest. Dorsal rowsof scales 2729, all smooth, except traces on central five or six, in a very few individuals; exterior row largest; rest nearly equal.

to the anus (in one specimen only thirty-three anterior to the anus). These are ten or twelve scales broad, two or three long, and separated by intervals of one or two scales. They are narrowly margined with black. On each side of the dorsal series, and alternating with it, is a series of smailer, nearly circular, but similarly constituted blotches extending between the third and seventh or eighth rows; below this and on the second and third rows is a still smaller and quite distinct third series, and occasionally traces of a fourth on the first and second. The ground color or space between the blotches is grayish ash; each scale minutely mottled with dark brown or black; the extreme border

generally pure ash, especially on the sides. Beneath yellowish white, with rather indistinct blotches of brownish ash, thickest behind.
Head grayish ash, with a somewhat curved broad brown vitta on the back part of the postfrontals, which, involving the commissure of the anteorbital and superciliary, passes back through -the eye, and, crossing the angle of the mouth on the adjacent halves of the ultimate and penultimate labials, extends into the blotches on the sides of the neck. A second nearly effaced bar crosses the anterior frontals, leaving an ash-colored band half the width of the first-mentioned bar. The anterior dorsal blotch is replaced by two elongated ones running up on the head to the center of the occipitals, parallel with the postocular vitta, with an ash-colored stripe between the two, which extends from the superciliary backward on the sides of the neck. As in the other brown

<<<Page: 879>>>

marks, these stripes are margined with black. The adjacent edges of the fourth and fifth labials are brown. This is the only species, except C. guttatus, in which the postocular vitta crosses the angle of the mouth and passes down the side of the neck. There is scarcely any indication of elongation in the lateral spots except anteriorly.
This species differs from C. vulpinus in the gray color, much larger eye, longer head, narrower vertical, etc.; from C. letws in much the same points, as well as in having the dorsal spots transverse, not longitudinal; from C. obsoletus in lighter color and absence of white margins to the basal ends of the dorsal scales, and from all in the smooth dorsal scales. :

This is a southwestern species of the Eastern region, not having been yet found east of the Mississippi River nor north of Kansas. Its range extends at least as far south on the Mexican Plateau as the city of Chihuahua, where it has been found abundantly by Mr. Edward Wilkinson.

<<<Page: 881>>>

longitudinal bands behind frontal region; all the markings becoming obsolete in a general brown color with maturity.
The head is rather long and narrow. The prefrontals are each longer than wide; the frontal is not narrowed; the parietals are truncate behind. The suture between the loreal and prefrontal is oblique, running posteriorly downward, so that its superior border is only half as long as the inferior. The preocular does not reach the frontal. There are, as in other Mexican species of the genus, but two postoculars. The eye is over the fourth and fifth labial. None of the labials behind the fifth is elevated, but the sixth is elongate so as to border the ends of the three long temporal scuta. The inferior of these covers the seventh and part of the eighth labials and supports above it two others like it, all being directed downward and forward. The superior incloses a little scale with the superior postocular. Inferior labials, eleven; geneials well developed, the posterior smaller and separated by scales.
In a young specimen 450 mm. in length, where the color markings have not become obsolete, there are seventy-six dorsal spots, of which fifty-one are between the nape and the vent. These spots are transversely quadrate, covering eleven scales transversely and two and a half scales anteroposteriorly. They are dark brown with light edges and paler centers. The interspaces are less than two scales long. The lateral spots are opposite the intervals and are in one row; they are subround or suboval. There are two brown stripes on the nape which, instead of uniting at both ends, as is the case in the C. flavirufus, are separate posteriorly and diverge anteriorly, extending to above the posterior part of the orbits. Between them another band occupies the middle line, but is more or less broken. A broad brown band convex forward between the fronts of the orbits. A brown spot behind orbit. Below, immaculate. Gastrosteges, two hundred and eighty-two; anal double; urosteges, one hundred and nine.
Measurements.—Total length, 1.090 mm.; tail, 235 mm.
Slight variations sometimes occur in the C.mutabilis. One specimen has thirty-five rows of scales; another has but two rows of temporals on one side; another has nine superior labials on one side.
Of the Coluber mutabilis I have before me four specimens from Vera Paz,from Mr. Hague; one from the plateau of Costa Rica, from Mr. Zele_ don, and one from the central or elevated part of the State of Oaxaca, from Mr. Sumichrast. I have examined a seventh specimen in the collection of Prof. Alfredo Dugés, who took it in the State of Guanajuato. Dr. Dugés informs me that it has been also found near Leon, so that there is no doubt that it belongs to the plateau of Mexico as well as to that of Guatemala. According to the same author it occurs also in San Luis Potosi and in Guerrero.
Dr. Boulenger, in the Catalogue of Snakes in the British Museum, has confused this species with the (C. triaspis Cope. The differences between the species are enumerated in the analytical table on page 828.

This genus embraces the largest ground snakes of the Neotropical realm, together with a number of species of smaller size of the Paleotropical. It differs from Coluber in its entire anal plate, resembling in this respect Pityophis, Epiglottophis, and Rhinechis. It approaches the last named most nearly in characters, but the rostral shield has not the production anteriorly and posteriorly seen in that genus.
The Asiatic species have a compressed form of the body which is not seen in the American forms. Some of the latter have a roof-shaped body with subtriangular section (C. sulphureum), while in others (8. corais) the body is subeylindric. The scales assume a slightly transverse direction in some of the American species. But one species is found in the United States, and this is a Neotropical species which ranges from Brazil through Mexico and the Gulf States to the Atlantic coast.
It may be found necessary to separate the American species from this genus, as has been done by Boulenger, under the name of Phrynonaxr Cope. I do not at present, however, know of any character which requires this. The difference of dentition pointed out by Dr. Boulenger isinsignificant, as his definitionindicates. Theintegrity of theanal plate is a definite character that can always be observed, which is more than can be said for the slight differences of dentition referred to. The character of the anal plate is not quite constant in one of the Asiatic species (C. virgatum), according to Boulenger.

Specimens from the Lower Rio Grande have a good deal of brown on the bases, edges, or tips of the scales, thus approaching the form melanurus. On the other hand, specimens from the sea islands of Georgia are everywhere pure black, except some brownish-red shades on the throat and chin. Specimens from this locality have in some instances but seven superior labials, and I do not know of any which has eight on both sides. Two specimens (Cat. Nos. 4457, 4458) have seven on one side and eighton the other. The species Spilotes couperii was proposed by Dr. Holbrook for this form, but I find no characteristic to separate it from the individuals from the other Gulf States and Texas, except the number of labials, and this is, as observed, variable.

Head distinct, elongate. Rostral plate rounded in profile, much elevated; posterior angle right, not reaching postfrontals. The latter, three times the size of the prefrontals. Vertical longer than broad, the anterior border straight, as long as the occipitals. Five or six small temporals on each side. Nasal plates large; loreal longer than high. Preoculars one or two, postoculars three. Superior labials eight or nine, liable to irregular subdivision; fourth and fifth or fourth, fifth, and sixth entering the orbit. Twelve inferior labials; postgeneials very small. Scales small in twenty-seven rows, the median ten keeled. Tail very short. Gastrosteges, 234-244; urosteges, 69-72. General color of a specimen long preserved in spirits, above light brown; beneath paler. The head is without markings. On the anterior part of the body, two black bands, two and two halves rows of scales apart, extend for four times the Jength of the head and terminate each in a narrow elliptic annulus. The latter are nearly confluent with the succeeding pair of annuli, which are very narrow. These increase in breadth posterior!y until near the middle of the body they become confluent on the median line, forming geminate open spots; near the tail they lose the geminate form. Their whole number is thirty-six pairs, separate or united. Alternating with these is a smaller series of annuli, which, become elongate anteriorly, and finally become short black lines, parallel to, and three scales from the median pair. A few spots on the extremities of the gastrosteges or the posterior part of the abdomen.

This species was originally described from a specimen in*the museum of the Philadelphia Academy from Jalapa. It therefore inhabits both the Austroriental and Austroceidental districts. The LH. pleurostictus

<<<Page: 887>>>

is found in the Austrocentral and Austroccidental districts, as well as in the Chihuahuan of the Sonoran subregion. The LH. lineaticollis is also reported by Giinther from Durnas, in Guatemala.
Though this species differs widely in color characters from the £. pleurostictus it resembles it closely structurally. Boulenger places the two in different sections of the genus Coluber, one of which is charac— terized by a more, and the other by a less, distinct vertical angulation of the ends of the gastrosteges. I, however, find no difference between the two species in this respect. The following characters may, however, be noted: The head in the EF. lineaticollis is larger relatively to the general dimensions than in the EZ. pleurostictus. Thus the cephalic plates are of equal length in two specimens of these species, of which the EF. lineaticollis measures 950 mm. and the HL. pleurostictus, 1,145 mm. The gastrosteges and urosteges are more numerous in the #. lineaticollis. In this species there are in two specimens, gastrosteges 242, urosteges 72, and gastrosteges 234, urosteges 69. Boulenger counts 2444.69. In two specimens of H. pleurostictus I find, gastrosteges 228, urosteges 58, and gastrosteges 221, urosteges 54. Boulenger gives gastrosteges 209-233, urosteges 51-67. My three specimens of EH. lineaticollis, like Giinther’s, have twenty-seven rows of scales, and the three of EH. pleurostictus before me have twenty-nine. Of seven specimens of the latter in the British Museum three have twenty-nine rows and four twenty-seven, according to Boulenger. Finally, the relations of the frontal and supraocular plates differ in the two. In the Z.lineaticollis the supraoculars are narrow and the frontal wide; in the EH. pleurostictus the supraoculars are relatively wider. The shorter head of the latter species is shown in the loreal, which is as deep as long, while in the #. lineaticollis it is a little longer than deep.
Measurements.—The longest specimen of this species in the U. 8. National Museum measures 1,320 mm.; tail, 190 mm. The British Museum specimen measures 1,500 mm. The longest H. pleurostictus (Cat. No. 9065) in the U.S. National Museum measures 1,145 mm.; tail, 165 mm. The British Museum catalogue gives 1,690 mm. as the ’ greatest length.

at one time thought to be allied to Pityophis in view of the presence of the two characters in question, but the absence of the epiglottis and undivided prefrontals show that it is distinct. There are several minor characters, not generic, which show that its affinities are not with the species of Pityophis. Such are the peculiar forms of the inferior labial, prenasal, and loreal plates, and the very fine bristle-like spicules of the hemipenis, in the American species at least.
Two species are known, which differ as follows: Seales in from 27 to 31 rows. Tail less than one-sixth the length. Brownish gray,

as to depress the form of the prenasal, a peculiarity I have not observed in any other North American snake. Prefrontals not so long as their posterior width. Frontal very wide in front, the lateral borders contracting posteriorly so as to greatly diminish the posterior lateral angles and to give the plate a subtriangular outline in adults. It follows that the superciliaries are triangular, with an oblique posterior outline. Parietals a little longer than wide, subtruncate posteriorly. Nostril in a fissure, which extends obliquely downward and backward, rendering each of the nasal plates subtriangular.. Loreal considerably longer than high, with the superior border oblique downward and posteriorly. Oculars 1-2, temporals 2-4, the anterior elongate, and bounding the summit of the large seventh superior labial. Superior labials eight, fourth and fifth entering orbit; higher than long from the third to the sixth, inclusive. Seventh larger than usual, exceeding the sixth and eighth together, longer above than on the labial border. This size explains the absence of the usual second row of three temporals. The inferior labials are peculiar for their large number and unusual form. They number from thirteen to fourteen, and are all, therefore, deeper than long. This is especially the case with those from the third to the sixth, inclusive, which are produced in long points backward to the geneial plates. The seventh is the longest plate, but is separated by a scale from the geneial. Pregeneials of moderate length; postgeneials much shorter and narrower, and separated by 2-4 rows of scales. Behind these there are three transverse rows of small scales, anterior to the first gastrosteges.

The ground color above is a grayish brown, growing paler at the median line. This is crossed by from fifty-five to sixty-five transverse brown spots anterior to the anus, which have the anterior and posterior borders a little darker than their central portions. These extend over twelve or thirteen rows of scales and are separated by spaces of one and a half or two scales in width. On the side is a series of spots, each of which is opposite a space, and is deeper than long. The scales of this region have their centers brown shaded, so as to obscure the distinctness of the lateral spots in some specimens. Belly yellowish-white, unspotted. On the nape two wide longitudinal stripes extend from the anterior transverse spot to the parietal plates. A blackish streak from eye to angle of mouth. Labials unspotted in adults, but with a spot under the eye in the young.
This species is subject to some variations. Thus in Cat. No. 4266 there is a small inferior preocular. In Cat. No. 14676 there are only

twenty-seven rows of scales, and there is a row of three temporais between the usual 2-4 scaled rows.
This species is restricted in its range to the Sonoran region. The most southern locality yet known is near the city of Chihuahua. The most northern is north of the Cimarron River, probably in New Mexico.
Mr. Bocourt objects to my placing this species in the genus Rhinechis, as he says that the FR. scalaris has the anal plate divided. It is true that Duméril and Bibron state that this is the case, but on examining four specimens from the Bonaparte collection in the Museum of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, I find that the anal plate
is entire. Thinechis elegans Kennicott.

This genus of Colubrine snakes includes rather large and robust species. They are restricted exclusively to the Nearctic realm and the Lower Californian district of the Neotropical. They are entirely terrestrial in their habits, preferring dry and even sandy regions to any other. They are of a harmless disposition as a general rule, but the P. sayi bellona defends itself vigorously when attacked, The peculiar epiglottis, first observed and described by Dr. ©. A. White, of Washington, aids these snakes in emitting an unusually loud hiss on the

<<<Page: 891>>>

expiration of the air contained in their voluminous lung. This sound, although it can not be called a voice, is sufficiently loud to be alarming, and serves, no doubt, as a defense.
The question as to the number of species included in this genus is a difficult one to decide. The P. melanoleucus may be always distinguished by color characters from the forms found west of the Mississippi River. From some of these it also differs in the shape of the head and muzzle, but the most eastern of the western forms, P. sayi sayi, resembles it in these respects. The Lower Californian form may be distinguished from the P. melanoleucus by color characters and by the shape of the head and muzzle, but between it and the P. sayi of the western Mississippi region there is a complete transition in most of the characters. The California form resembles that of Lower California in form,

but differs in color, while the Arizona form is in every respect intermediate between the Pacific form (P. catenifer) and the P. sayi of the plains. These forms are tolerably constant and can be generally recognized. The form of the rostral plate is the most characteristic peculiarity, but from the nature of the case transitions occur. Under the circumstances, I have adopted four species, of which the P. sayi has two subspecies, one of which, P. s. bellona, is intermediate between its typical form and the P. catenifer, the latter differing, however, in the greater smoothness of the scales.

The head stripes consist of a band extending from the eye to the angle of the mouth; another from the eye to the upper lip below it, and another connecting the orbits across the front of the frontal plate. These stripes are present in the young of the species, which lack them at maturity. The increase in the number of spots is accomplished by the division of those on the posterior part of the body.
The number of the labial plates is apt to be unequal on the opposite side. Thus in seventy-two specimens examined, fifteen have nine labials on one side and eight on the other. The P. catenifer displays the greatest irregularity in this respect, six out of sixteen specimens having labials 8-9.

Nostrils vertically oblong, situated in the middle and between both plates. Loreal ovoid, small, horizontal. One large anteorbital, with its anterior margin convex, of the same width above as below. Three postorbitals, proportionally large. Temporal shields small, three or

four in the first row. Upper labials eight, seventh largest, fourth coming into the orbit. Lower labials fourteen, fifth and sixth largest, the five posterior ones quite small. Posterior pair of mental shields onethird of the size of the anterior pair, and reaching backward to opposite the middle of the lower sixth labial. Tail conical and tapering, forming © about the seventh of the total length.
The ground color, when living, is white; as preserved in alcohol it is light yellowish brown. The head is spotted in the young with black

spots, but nearly white in the adult; frontal bar rather wide; postocular vitta broad in the young, but wanting in theadult. A dorsal series of very large blotches, of a deep chestnut-brown, broadly margined with black anteriorly and posteriorly. These blotches are twenty-four in number from the head to opposite the anus, and six on the tail, where they extend laterally down to the subcaudal scutelle. More or less confluent, and consequently irregular in shape on the anterior third of the body, they are posteriorly subround or subquadrate, emarginated in front and behind, and separated from each other by a light space

<<<Page: 894>>>

embracing four scales, while the blotches themselves cover six scales. The flanks are blotched but very irregularly; on the anterior region of the body the blotches elongate in the shape of longitudinal bands or vitt; on the middle region three indistinct series may be traced, alternating and often confluent by their corners; posteriorly there is only one series opposite to the dorsal, and often confluent with it, so that the corresponding blotches form single patches, extending from the back to the abdomen, and tapering on the sides. The abdomen is dull yellow, with a series of distant blackish brown patches along the extremity of the seutell, often extending to the outer row of scales.
Specimens from Florida have the dark colors, rusty or rufous, instead of deep brown or black, and the outlines of the spots are not so well defined.
This species ranges from New Jersey to Florida, preferring the sandy pine woods of the coastal plain. It is the largest snake of this region. It is of a very harmless disposition, and may be handled with impunity.

Head with the rostral plate more or less prominent forward and produced and narrowed upward and posteriorly. Superior labial plates 8-8 to 9-9. Scales in from twenty-seven to thirty-three rows, keeled, except Six rows on each side. Dorsal spots more numerous than in P. melanoleucus, varying from fifty to sixty-five on the body, sometimes as few as forty. Two to three rows of spots on each side. Generally no subeaudal stripe. Head with three bands, one extending between the orbits, one from the orbit directly downward to the labial border, and one from the orbit to the angle of the mouth. Temporal scales small, generally 3-3 to 4-4, rarely 2-2.
This species occupies the entire interior of the United States and the Mexican plateau to the valley of Mexico. Eastward it crosses the Mississippi River into the prairie country of Llinois. It is represented by two forms, which only differ in the form of the rostral plate. One of these (P. s. bellona) inhabits Arizona and New Mexico only, and is

transverse jet-black bars across the tail. Abdomen yellowish, thickly maculated with black patches.
Head proportionally large, ovoid, distinct from the body. Snout pointed. Parietal plates small. Frontal broad, subpentagonal, slightly concave on thesides. Superciliaries large. Internal prefrontals rather narrow, elongated; external prefrontals quadrilateral, a little broader forward. Internasals irregularly quadrangular. Rostral very narrow, extending halfway between the prefrontals, convex, and raised above the surface of the snout. Nostrils in the middle line between the nasals, the posterior of which is a little the smaller. Loreal trapezoidal, proportionally large. Inferior anteorbital very small, resting upon the fourth upper labial. Postorbitals varying in comparative size. Temporal Shields small, resembling scales. Upper labials eight to nine, sixth and seventh the larger. Lower labials twelve, sixth and seventh largest. Posterior mental shields very small, extending to opposite the junction of the seventh and eighth lower labials. Scales proportionally small, in twenty-nine to thirty-three rows, the six outer ones perfectly smooth and somewhat larger than the remaining rows.
Ground color yellowish-brown, with three series of dorsal black blotches, forty-five to sixty-five in number, from the head to opposite the anus, with twelve on the tail, in the shape of transverse bars. Those of the medial series the larger, and covering eight or nine rows of scales. On the anterior part of the body they are subcircular, embracing longitudinally four scales; posteriorly they become shorter by one scale. The light spaces between are a little narrower than the blotches themselves for the twelve anterior blotches and wider than the blotches for the remaining length of the body. The blotches of the adjoining series alternate with those of the medial series, being opposite to the light intermediate spaces, across which the blotches of either side are generally united by a transversal narrow band. The flanks are densely covered with small and irregular blotches, forming three indistinct series, confluent in vertical bars toward the origin of the tail. Inferior surface of the head yellowish, unicolor. Abdomen dull yellow, with crowded brownish-black blotches in series on the extremity of the scutella.

This subspecies ranges from western Canada to the Valley of Mexico, inclusive. It is the common species of Texas, and even occurs in Sonora. It is a curious fact that this form has both the extreme northern and southern ranges, while the Arizonian form is so restricted,
Two living specimens of this form were under my observation for a number of months. Their hissing was remarkably loud and prolonged, and they threw the tail into rapid vibrations, as do rattlesnakes, ete. They would not eat, and died of starvation.

Head elliptical, rather pointed, little compressed. Vertical plate very broad anteriorly. A second anterior vertical, small, and subcordiform. Anteorbitals two; postorbitals four. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-nine to thirty-three; the seven outer rows smooth. Tail about one-twelfth of total length. Head maculated with black; transverse frontal bar extending from one orbit to the other, well marked; the oblique postocular vitta rather narrow, and reaching the angle of the mouth. Color of the body whitish yellow, sometimes reddish yellow, with a dorsal series of deep black blotches, or of deep brown, margined with black, forty-five to sixty-three in number, from the head to the origin of the tail, and a series of smaller spots on each side. Ten transverse jet black bars on the tail. Flanks erowded with small and irregular blotches. Abdomen dull yellow, maculated with black blotches more or less crowded.
Head broad behind, and well separated from the body by a con

tracted neck, very much tapering to the end of the snout, subquadrangular from the eyes forward. Upper surface flattened; snout elevated and rounded. Occipital plates triangular, as broad anteriorly as long. Superciliaries longer than either the vertical or occipitals. Frontal subpentagonal, very broad anteriorly, as broad as long, and very much tapering posteriorly; its sides concave. A second small subcordiform anterior frontal sometimes present; is situated between the external prefrontals, which are comparatively the larger. Internal prefrontals irregularly triangular, and smaller than the internasals, which are irregularly quadrangular. The rostral is triangular, wide below and narrow above, and raised but little above the surface of the snout, not dividing, however, the prefrontals. Nasals subquadrangular, anterior one alittle larger; nostrils situated between the two plates, but more in ‘the posterior one. Loreal very small, narrow, and elongated, horizontal in position. Two anteorbitals, inferior one very small; upper one very

regular, slightly convex on its anterior margin. Postorbitals four in number, oceasionally only three, the two upper ones a little larger. Numerous small temporal shields. Upper labials eight (rarely nine), sixth and seventh somewhat larger. Lower labials thirteen, seventh largest; the six posterior ones the smallest. Dorsal scales elliptically elongated, constituting twenty-nine to thirty-three rows, the six outer of which are smooth, the others carinated, the five outermost very sensibly the larger.
The ground color is whitish yellow; on the anterior third and upper part of the body, the bases and sometimes the two anterior thirds of the seales are jet black, so as to make the ground color appear black. There are fifty-one large chocolate-brown dorsal blotches, margined with jet black from the head to opposite the anus, and ten on the tail. On the anterior portion of the body these blotches are subcireular, or rather elliptical, covering in width seven or eight rows of scales, and

<<<Page: 899>>>

four and two half-scales in length; the spaces between embrace about two scales. Posteriorly the blotches become quadrate, and the intermediate spaces increase so as to be at first equal to the blotches, and toward the origin of the tail they are actually wider by one scale than the blotches themselves. On the tail the blotches assume the shape of narrow transverse bars, tapering downward. On each side of the dorsal blotches is a series of much smaller and somewhat irregular blotches margined with black, the blotches being opposite to the light spaces, alternating, but not confluent with the medial blotches. On the anterior third of the body a series of small blotches is observed on the

flanks, and beneath it a series of elongated black patches, all of which exhibit a tendency to become obsolete vertical bars, more apparent posteriorly in very large individuals, giving to the flanks a nebulous appearance. The head above is yellowish brown, with small black spots on the vertex and occiput. Frontal black bar distinct in small individuals, obsolete in very large ones; postorbital vitta narrow; suborbital spot small. Inferior surface of the head and abdomen light straw color, with an external series of distant black spots on each side, confluent under the tail, and constituting a medial band. Tail neither ringed nor longitudinally striped below with brown or black.

Some specimens from Oregon are intermediate between it and the P. catenifer.
The geographical range of this subspecies is the Great Basin from Oregon south, the basin of the Colorado, and Arizona,
The typical specimen of the Churchillia bellona Baird and Girard, which can not now be found, came from the valley of the Rio Grande, which is also the habitat of the P. sayt sayi. The second specimen enumerated in Baird and Girard’s Catalogue under the P. bellona is from western Texas, between San Antonio and El] Paso, and hence from the same region as the type. This specimen belongs to the P. sayi sayi.

Of seventeen specimens examined, seven have the superior labials 8-9; eight have 8-8; and two have 9-9. Four have twenty-nine rows of scales; ten have thirty-one rows; one has thirty-three; and one has thirty-five (Cat. No. 2243). The number of spots on the body is very variable. One has thirty-six dorsal spots (Cat. No. 1546); one has forty-six (Cat. No. 1532); seven have between fifty and sixty; four have between sixty and seventy; and four have over seventy, the highest being seventy-nine (Cat. No. 1816). The specimen (Cat. No. 5741) on which the P. wilkesit Baird and Girard was tounded is abnormal in the nondivision of the prefrontal scuta; the only example I have observed in the genus.
The range of this species is coterminous with the Pacific region, extending from San Diego on the south to Puget Sound on the north. It is found in the Mohave Desert, and at Pyrmont, Nevada (Cat. No. 8139). Northward it extends to eastern Oregon and to Walla Walla, Washington.

Posterior maxillary teeth larger and more robust than the anterior, not separated from them by an interspace. Hemipenis colubriform, with numerous fringed calyces. Cephalic plates normal; anal plate entire; urosteges two rows. Scales with two apical pits.
This genus is intermediate between the Coronelline type of snakes and the Colubrine. The scutellation and dentition are identical with those of the genus Ophibolus, but the hemipenis is of a very different character, being identical with that of Coluber, Phrynonaa, ete. The dentition separates it rather weakly from the latter genus. It ranges from the eastern district of the Medicolumbian to the Columbian region of the Neotropical realm, inclusive.
I know of but two species of this genus. They were formerly referred to Ophibolus. They differ as follows:
Temporal seuta 2-2-3; scales in 21 rows; a loreal; spotted or annulate, larger. O, doliata Linnzus. Temporal scuta 1-2-3; scales in 17-19 rows; no loreal; annulate; smaller. O. elapsoidea Holbrook.

Loreal small, longer than high; one preocular, two postoculars. Temporals 2-2 (rarely 1-2). Frontal rather wide, narrowing the superciliaries in front. Parietals rather wide, the length a little less than that of frontal and prefrontals combined. Seven superior labials, all higher than long except the first, the third and fourth bounding the orbit. Geneials, the anterior about twice the size of the posterior. — Size medium to small.
The ground color of the superior surfaces varies from ashen to bright yellow, but it only appears as transverse spaces between the broad reddish-brown to crimson spots or saddles which cross the back. The extent to which these spots preserve their outlines or surround the body like rings forms the indication of the characters of various subspecies. The coloration of the head varies from red or black abruptly cut off posteriorly, to banded with two chevrons, a brown within a yellow one, with a yellow cross-band on the nose.
The variations of this species are remarkable and form the subjent of some remarks I made on former occasions, and which I now quote:!
The most northern and the most southern forms of the genus Osceola, the O. triangula and O. coccinea, have always been regarded as distinct species; and so numerous are their differential characters in coloration, size, and squamation that this view would seem to rest on a satisfactory foundation. I find, however, that individuals exist which represent every stage of development of each character which distinguishes them, although certain types appear to be more abundant than the interme— diate ones. O. triangula is a species of larger size, with two temporal plates, a row of large brown dorsal spots, and other smaller ones on the sides, on a grayish ground, with a chevron, and often other marks on the top of the head, and a band posterior to the eye. 0. coccinea is a small snake with a small loreal plate and one temporal shield; color red, with pairs of black rings extending round the body, and no markings on the head excepting that the anterior ring of the anterior pair crosses the posterior edge of the occipital shields, forming a half collar. The transition is accomplished thus: The lateral borders of the dorsal spots of O. triangula break up, and the lateral spots become attached to their anterior and posterior dark borders. The chevron of the top of the head first breaks into spots, and then its posterior portions unite with each other. The borders of the old dorsal spots continue to the abdomen, where the remaining lateral portions finally meet on the middle line, _ forming a black line. This breaks up and disappears, leaving the annuli open; and these are then completed in many specimens. The general colors become more brilliant and the size smaller. The head is more depressed; in immediate relation to this form, the loreal plate is reduced in size, and the two temporal shields of O. triangula are sometimes reduced to one. Every form of combination of these characters can be found, which represent five species of the books (in North America), viz: O. triangula, O. doliata, O. annulata, O. gentilis, and O. coccinea. The oldest name is the 0. doliata Linn. Another series of specimens resemble very closely those of the subspecies coccinea; in fact, are identical with them in color. The loreal shield is, however, extinguished, and the rows of scales are reduced by one on each side. These specimens simply carry one degree further the modifications already described. Yet, on account of the constancy of these characters, I am compelled to regard these individuals not only as a distinct species, but, on account of the absence of the loreal plate, as belonging to another genus. This is the Calamaria elapsoidea of Holbrook; the Osceola elapnonies of Baird and Girard. It affords an illustration

<<<Page: 908>>>

of the principle, which I have elsewhere insisted on, ‘that adjacent species of allied genera inay be more alike than remote species of identical generic characters,” which indicates that generic characters originate independently of the specific.
The transitions above noted are not, however, without mutual correlations. The characters are found so associated in such a great majority of the specimens as to indicate the existence of subspecies whose definitions are given below. Exceptions to these are given under the head of each subspecies.

The more detailed transition from the simple head coloration of the O. d. coccinea to the complex pattern of the O. d. triangula is accomplished as follows:
A yellowish spot is seen on the superciliary plate of the single specimen of the O. d. parallela known, and on three of the fifteen specimens of the O. d. syspila. It appears in all of the thirteen O. d. doliata, and in two of these they nearly join across the front, and in three they join forming a cross band. In four specimens of the O. d. doliata a notch of the black anterior border of the nuchal collar appears on each side. The depressing of this notch till it reaches the eye defines the two postocular stripes of the subspecies of Section II of the preceding table.

<<<Page: 909>>>

It has not quite reached the orbit in Cat. Nos. 7849 and 2192 of the 0. d. collaris. The superciliary spots have not united across the front in any of the five specimens 0. d. coilaris, excepting in Cat. No. 5449. In Cat. No. 2433 it isnearly completed. Theinterorbital and postorbital bands are complete in the subspecies 0. d. clericaand O.d. triangula. Finally,
the completion of the head ornamentation is seen in the perfect defini-—
tion of the anterior boundary of the brown band in front of the interorbital light band. Thisis seen in three individuals of the O. d. doliata, in four of the O. d. collaris, all of the O. d. clerica, and in three of the five 0. d. triangula. In one of the latter it is simply indistinct; in another it is converted into a median spot by a yellow band, which extends from the interorbital band around the canthus nostralis and end of muzzle.
This species furnishes them a most instructive illustration of the
origin of color characters.
The geographical distribution of the Osceola doliata extends from latitude 48° through the eastern Austroriparian and southern part of the central district, and throughout Mexico and Central America to Panama. It is wanting from the Pacific and from the Sonoran districts. It does not appear on the west coast of Mexico north of Colima and Michoacan.
The phylogenetic relations of these subspecies may be sketched as follows:
Which is the ancestral form is uncertain, but as the region inhabited by the O. d. triangula is much older geologically than that where the O. d. coccinea is found, the former is probably the primitive type.
The geographical distribution of the subspecies is related to their characters. 0. d. coccinea is exclusively a form of the Gulf border, and O. d. triangula is northern, and is not recorded from south of Washington, District of Columbia. The other found in the same series occupy
the intermediate latitudes. The polyzona, occipitalis, and annulatas’
are Mexican, and the O. d. parallela is Floridan. The color increases in brilliancy to the south, as the O. d. triangula is brown spotted and the O. d. coccinea crimson. The size diminishes in general in the same direction, the species recovering its size in Mexico.

pitals. General color above yellowish-gray, with a dorsal series of large blotches, fifty-five in number from the head to the tip of the tail, the forty-fifth opposite to the anus. These are transversely elliptical, about four scales long, covering twelve to fifteen scales across the back (more anteriorly than posteriorly), and separated by intervals of one and a half to two scales, all of nearly the same width. The spots themselves are grayish-brown or chocolate, with a broad black border, and finely mottled internally (as isthe ground color on the sides) with black. The blotches become narrower posteriorly; on tie tail their confluence with the lateral series forms black half rings. On each side, and involving the second to the fifth rows, is another series of much smaller and nearly circular blotches, black with the centers brown. These alternate with the dorsal spots. Alternating with the series just described is still another similar to it, but entirely black, on the margin of the abdomen, and on the contiguous spots of the first, second, and third rows. These two lateral series are sometimes confluent. The anterior dorsal blotch is elongated, so as to cover the posterior half of the

<<<Page: 911>>>

vertical plate, and in it is a central elongated spot of the ground color behind the occipitals. A double light spot is seen on the junction of the occipitals. There is a dark band across the posterior half of the postfrontals, and another from the eye to the angle of the mouth. The labials are edged with black.
The abdomen is yellowish-white, with square black blotches, alternating with those already described.
The number and size of these spots varies somewhat in different specimens, though rarely less than forty from head to anus. The young differ in having the dorsal blotches bright chestnut-red inside of the black margins. ‘The intervals are sometimes white or clear ash.

This subspecies, the common “milk snake,” is abundant in the Middle States. It is very harmless in its manners, and useful in its habits. It lives on the small Mammalia, which are so injurious to the farmer. I once caught a specimen of this species which had captured a family of the Arvicola riparia, which it held in the following manner: One it had swallowed, one it was in the act of swallowing, and two others were securely held in two turns of the body so tightly as to render them incapable of biting their captor.
This form ranges farther north than any other representative of the genus. It is recorded by Professor A. E. Verrill as being common at Norway, Maine.

This subspecies is intermediate between the O. d. doliata and the O. d. clerica, as may be learned from the analytical table. In its head coloration there is variation in the development of the interorbital light cross band. It is complete in Cat. Nos. 2433 and 5449 only; in Cat. Nos. 2192 and 7849 it is represented by large superciliary spots, and in Cat. No. 9745 by small ones. The yellow postocular band is not complete in Cat. No. 7849. In Cat. No. 2433 the yellow half collar is interrupted on each side by the slight contact of the dark borders of the head color and the first saddle spot, showing how the neckbands of the two subspecies clerica and triangula are formed.

OSCEOLA DOLIATA SYSPILA Cope.
Ophibolus doliatus syspilus Corr, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 384.
Head small, flattened above, with the snout rounded; neck slightly contracted; body elongated, rather slender; scarlet above, and marked with black rings, in pairs; between each pair is a white ring.
The vertical plate is pentagonal, with an acute angle behind; the superior orbitals are oblong-quadrilateral, broadest behind, and not projecting over the eye; the occipitals are polygonal, and very large; the frontals are broad and pentagonal, narrowest externally, where they descend to join an elongate quadrilateral, loreal plate. The anterior frontals are also quadrilateral, smaller than the posterior, and broadest externally. ‘The rostral plate is large, heptagonal, and concave below. There are two nasal plates, the posterior square, the anterior lunated behind for the nostril, which does not enter the posterior, but comes out at its anterior border. There is a single anterior orbital plate, oblong, slightly concave behind, and two small, subround, posterior orbitals. The inferior wall of the orbit is made up of the third and fourth superior labial plates, of which there are seven.
Fig. 216. OSCEOLA DOLIATA SYSPILA COPE.
The nostrils are lateral and near the snout. The eyes are small, the iris bright reddish gray. The neck is but slightly contracted, and is covered with small, smooth, subhexagonal scales. The body is long, tolerably stout, and covered above with scales similar to those of the neck, but larger. The tail is rather short, thick at its root, but soon becomes smaller, and terminates in a tip.
The anterior top of the head is crossed with a black band at the extremities of the occipitals, and the dark color may extend as far as the prefrontal plates, inclusive. The body is scarlet, banded with twenty-two pairs of jet-black rings, with a white ring between each pair of black. These rings do not completely surround the body, as in Osceola elapsoidea, but the lower part of the anterior ring of one pair is continued within the margins of the gastrosteges, with the posterior ring of another pair, but always at a considerable distance on each side of the middle line.
The belly is marked with a single series of medium black spots, which are opposite the spaces between the dorsal saddles, or opposite the yellow rings. These spots represent the confluent lateral spots of the

<<<Page: 917>>>

O. d. doliata, clerica, etc., aS shown in the analytical table of the subspecies. Their complete fusion with the black rings, and the obliteration of the lateral closing lines of the saddle spots would give us the 0. d. annulata. The division of these median spots on the middle line, and their transposition to the sides, with the efevation of the lateral closing lines of the saddles to a point above the gastrosteges, would give us the O. d. doliata.
This subspecies is well sustained by sixteen specimens in the U.S, National Museum.
There are four partly distinct types of head coloration among these specimens. In Cat. Nos. 13008, 12925, 8345 the front is black to the end of the muzzle. In Cat. Nos. 1846, 2296, 4291 the end of the muzzle only isred. In Cat. Nos. 303 and 7850 the top of the head is reddish brown, and superciliary spots are present. In Cat. Nos. 13361, 13380, and an unnumbered specimen the top of the head is a uniform red or reddish gray; and in Cat. No. 21163 the upper surface is red, except the frontal plate and a broad band to the black collar, which are black. In this specimen there is no loreal plate on either side. There are only nineteen rows of scales, and the superior temporal of the first row is abnormally small. In these respects it approaches the O. elapsoidea.

The top of the head is reddish brown bounded posteriorly by black, which crosses the posterior border of the occipital seuta. This is followed by a yellow half collar, which is followed by the black exterior border of the first dorsal saddle, and which turns backward along the ends of the gastrosteges like the others. <A yellowish black-edged spot on each superciliary plate, and a similar one on the canthus rostralis, which sends a short branch along the anterior border of the prefrontal.

This subspecies occupies an interesting intermediate position between O. d. annulata and O. d. syspila. It differs from the former in the nonfusion of the lateral saddle borders and the absence of a black collar; from the latter in the absence of intermediate spots on the middle of the belly and the close approximations of the borders of the saddles.

Ground-color dull red, encircled by twenty-five pairs of black rings, the twenty-first opposite the anus, each pair inclosing a third ring of yellowish white. The black rings are conspicuously broader above, the three crossing eight scales on the vertebral row anteriorly, and toward the anus about five. Anteriorly the intervals between successive pairs consist of about five scales, posteriorly only of two or three, thus diminishing considerably. The black rings contract as they descend,
those of each pair reced-
ing slightly from each
other, so as to cause the
yellow portion to expand
about one scale. The
black rings are contin-
uous on the abdomen,
those of contiguous pairs
(not of the same pair)
sometimes with their in-
aS tervening spaces black.

being very rarely observ-
able on the red portion. The anterior black ring of the first pair is
extended so as to cover the whole head above, except the very tip;
the yellow ring behind it involves the extreme tip of the occipitals.
The black rings extend on the back so that the contiguous rings of
adjacent pairs run into each other. There are twenty-eight pairs of
rings, the twenty-fifth opposite the anus. The lateral borders of the
saddle spots are fused into a single large median black spot on the
abdomen, inclosing the extremities of the gastrosteges within the area ~
of the dorsal saddle. The abdomen opposite the yellow interspaces is not spotted.

The markings of this subspecies are quite as in the O. d. annulata, except that the black edges of the dorsal spots do not approach each other in that form. The scales are also narrower in the O. d. gentilis. The form is rare, as only one specimen is known to me.

Abdomen between the yellow rings black. Top of head entirely black, this color extending posteriorly upon the occipitals in an acute angle. <A broad occipital yellow ring.
General appearance similar to O. d. gentilis. The form is stouter, the head shorter, broader, and more depressed, and the eye smaller. The dorsal scales are different, being much broader; the lateral rows

in O. d. annulata are higher than long, and those of the central are nearly as wide as long. In O. d. gentilis, those of the lateral rows are considerably longer than high, and those of the central nearly twice as long as wide. There are twenty pairs of black rings from head to vent, which do not diverge on the sides, each ring covering two to two and a half scales longitudinally on the vertebral region and narrowing but little laterally. The inclosed yellow rings are one and a half scales wide on the vertebral region. The first three pairs of black rings behind the head are, with those inclosed, a little wider. The intervals of red ground-color occupy four or five scales on the middle of the body, and one or two more anteriorly and posteriorly. The yellow rings are of nearly uniform width, and completely surround the body. The Spaces between them on the abdomen are black. There are no black spots upon the body.

The variations presented by this series are instructive as showing the connections between these forms. In Cat. No. 7116 the abdominal black patches are divided by a pale longitudinal median line, which constitutes such a separation of the inferior borders of the saddle spots as characterizes the O. d. parallela. The head has the normal color. In Cat. No. 17031 these black patches are obsolete except as to the posterior four or five. It thus approaches the O. d. conjuncta Jan of Mexico, which it also resembles in head coloration. Cat. No. 17032, from the same locality, is colored typically.
The most northern locality from which I know this species is San Angelo, Texas, from which place I have received it from Mr. Otto Lerch. .
The O. doliata conjuncta' is from Mexico generally, but it has not yet been found near the border.
The 0. d. polyzona? is also very abundant in Mexico, especially in the
Sierra Caliente. It ranges as far south as Panama. It is brilliantly colored, and reaches the full dimensions of the species.

five or six scales. Anteriorly their intervals are eight or nine scales long, posteriorly somewhat less. The black rings, as they descend on the sides, separate somewhat, so as to leave an interval of about three scales; they are also somewhat narrower than above. On the abdomen they are generally interrupted, the corresponding ends of the same ring sometimes meeting and sometimes alternating. ‘The posterior bleck ring of the first pair does not continue under the throat. The anterior black ring of the first pair crosses the posterior part of the. occipitals, extending across between the angles of the mouth. The head in front of this is black, except the end of the muzzle and the adjacent labial plates, which are red. The narrow spaces between the black rings are dusted with black. The posterior edges of the labials are black.

Three other specimens are more. peculiar. Cat, No. 2299 has the front reddish, with a small, yellow, brownedged spot on the common suture of the parietals, which foreshadows the median spot or chevron of the O.d.triangula. Of Cat. No. 2312, from northern Louisiana, one has but one temporal on one side, and the superior temporal very narrow in the other; and in both the face is red and the muzzle prominent and depressed, as in Osceola elapsoidea. In one of them the loreal is wanting from both sides, while iv the other it is present on both sides. These specimens are annectent to the species above named.

While this form graduates on the one side into the Osceola elapsoidea, it approximates, on the other, nearly to the O.d. conjuncia Jan of Mexico on the other. In fact, it is principally distinguished from the latter by its inferior size.

The color is a delicate red with a black tip upon each scale. The

<<<Page: 924>>>

body is completely encircled by ten or more pairs of jet-black rings, which vary in the degree of their distinctness, and are continued across the belly. The space included in each pair is three or four scales wide, and is red, each scale having a black tip. The tail is ornamented with two pairs of black rings and a black tip. Anterior to the first pair of rings a black collar four seales wide encircles the neck, scarcely touching the tips of the occipitals; the superciliary frontal, except its anterior border, and the occipitals within a line drawn diagonally from the posterior termination of their suture to the lower postocular, are black. A spot below the eye, one on the chin, the end of the muzzle, and the posterior borders of most of the other plates of the head are black. The spaces inclosed between the black spaces, which cross the parietal and internasal plates, are yellow.
This brilliantly colored subspecies varies very much in the development and relations of the black rings. Several of the forms are beautifully figured by both Bocourt and Giinther, as above cited. Boulenger gives the following variations as having come under hisobservation :! A. Annuli separated by broad red interspaces; red scales not tipped with black.
B. Annuli separated by broad red interspaces, the scales of which are tipped with black.
. Black rings, irregular; belly black.
. Black with yellow rings, the red color appearing on each side as rounded spots.
. Red above, each scale tipped with black, the rings reduced to mere traces here
and there. . Almost uniform black, with very indistinct traces of light annuli.
The presence of twenty-three rows of scales is not uncommon.
This subspecies belongs to the Central American subregion of Neotropica, and I have not seen it from the plateau, but described it from three specimens from Jalapa in the Tierra Templada, in the museum of the Philadelphia Academy. Duges, however, records it from Guanajuato, and Boulenger mentions specimens from the City of Mexico and from Amula, Guerrero, so that it must be introduced here. Boulenger’s A and B are the most common varieties, B more so than A.

lated to produce confusion. It is generally understood that of two names simultaneously published, an author has the right to select whichever one he chooses when the two apply to the same thing. Moreover, Boulenger regards it as a full species, whereas formerly he agreed with me that it can only be maintained as a subspecies of the Osceola doliata. If one examines the analytical table or compares the diagnoses of this and the allied forms in the Catalogue of the British Museum he will not find-any characters given to substantiate this
change of view, but rather evidence that the first opinion of Dr. Bou|
lenger was the correct one. = Sumichrast in his manuscript notes, says of this subspecies:
Among the numerous Mexican snakes which are called “coralillas,” this one attains the largest dimensions. It is distributed throughout the warm and temperate regions, but disappears in the alpine region, where, at least, I have never observed it. This snake prefers shaded localities, as plains covered with tall herbs and along rivers. Although of a very harmless disposition, it is not easily caught, since on
being alarmed it glides swiftly through the vegetation and is not long in disappear~ ing in the gallery excavated by some other animal. It also lives in the enormous | nests of the ant Orcodoma whexicana, on which it warms itself in the sun. Although |
entirely inoffensive, it does not escape the charge of being poisonous, as all the coralillas are supposed to be by the natives.

The relations of this species to the O. doliata coccinea are interesting. The characters of typical examples of the two are clear enough, but in one specimen and another they all fail. Florida specimens are generally true to those of O. elapsoidea, but in the other Gulf States exeeptionsoccur. Thus, Cat. No.5560 (Columbus, Georgia), is a coccinea with

<<<Page: 926>>>

only nineteen rows of scales. In Cat. Nos. 10743, 9689, 20137, otherwise true elapsoidea, a loreal plate is present. In Cat. No. 17924 otherwise a true elapsoidea, the first row of temporals consists of two scales, the — upper well developed on one side and rudimental on the other. In the following specimens there are only seventeen rows of scales: Cat. Nos. 2305, 11988, 13644, 17391, 18030, all from Florida. These are all elapsoidea in scutal characters except Cat. No. 11988, which has a loreal on one side. I have in my private collection a specimen with one loreal. The rostral plate is more prominent in the O, elapsoidea than in the O. d. coccinea.
I suspect that this species has been derived from the O. d. coccinea by a process of reduction of scale formule, accompanying reduction in size. The transitional stages have been in fact discovered, as above pointed out, in a few individuals, which are much less numerous than those of the two types.

Posterior maxillary teeth larger and stronger than the anterior. Head but little distinct. Cephalic scuta normal. Rostral plate not modified; loreal present; one preocular. Scales smooth, with two apical pits. Anal scutum entire; subcaudal scuta in two rows. Pupil round. Hemipenis with very few calyces and many spines; former apical, not fringed.
This genus represents in North America the Coronella of the Old World, but is abundantly distinct in its entire anal scutum, its double seale pits, and the reduced number of its penial calyces. Its six species form a very homogeneous group, and although they present abundant differences to the eye, critical examination shows that their characters are by no means easy to determine. Some of them (0. getulus) otter a degree of variation within themselves which is not equaled by any other North American species with the exception of the Hutenia sirtalis. They afford excellent lessons in the evolution of specific types.
The subtraction of the former 0. doliatus and its reference to the Osceola, leaves Ophibolus exclusively Nearctic in distribution, and it is found in every part of the realm except the extreme Northwest and the Canadian district.
The species differ as follows:

The distribution of these species is as follows: The O. getulus has nearly the same Eastern range, not reaching so far north by 10°, and covers the Sonoran and Pacific regions besides, but is scarcely found in continental Mexico. The O. pyrrhomelas inhabits the Sonoran and southern part of the Pacific regions. The 0. rhombomaculatus oceupies the middle regions east of the Appalachian Mountains, and the 0. calligaster the corresponding region west of those mountains, and extends west as far as the Pecos River of Texas.

imperfect, darker margins, and sometimes with a faint areola lighter than the ground color. On each side and alternating with this series is a second on the second to the sixth outer rows, and-about a seale Jong; then a third again, alternating on the first, second, and third rows, Sometimes involving the edges of the scutelle. These, though smaller than the dorsal spots, are similar. They are sometimes confluent with each other, though rarely with those of the back. There is sometimes a faint stripe from the eye to the angle of the mouth, but this is frequently wanting. A short wide longitudinal band like the

dorsal spots on each side the nape, embracing in some specimens a similar longitudinal spot on the parietal scuta.
The head is very little distinct from the body, and the muzzle is obtuse, with the rostral plate four-fifths as high as wide. The loreal plate is small, and generally more nearly square than in Osceola doliata. The eye is small, and the inferior of the two postoculars isonger than deep. Temporals 2-5-4. The superior labials are deeper than long, except the first and the last. The scales of the body are in twenty-one rows. They arerather wide and graduated in dimensions, the increase in size of the first and second rows not being abrupt.

This species was for a long time rare in our museums, but recently a good many specimens have been taken, especially from the neighborhood of Washington, District of Columbia. Its range is from Georgia to the Potomac hiver, so far as known. Two, and probably three, specimens have been recently taken on the Virginia side of that river; one near Alexandria,and one near Munson’s Hill by Dr. A. K. Fisher. Dr, Fisher showed me his specimens, which belongs to the Museum of the United States Department of Agriculture, in a fresh state. It did not exhibit the bright salmon red of the belly described and figured by Holbrook, but was of a cream color with large pale reddish spots.
The affinities of this species to the Osceola doliata are not close, on account of the wide difference in penial characters. The color pattern and shades are quite different, but apart from this the external distinctive features are few. The uniform presence of three temporals in the second row is contrasted with the usual occurrence of but two in the O. doliata. The penial structure allies it to the Ophibolus calligaster and is widely different from that of the Osceola doliata.

This species is quite constant in its characters, but a few variations occur. Thus there is but one temporal of the first row, and the loreal is fused with the postnasal on both sides in Cat. No.15329. In Cat. No. 16294 there are twenty-three rowsof scales. Cat. No.17444, a young individual, presents many anomalies. There is but one nasal plate on both sides, and on one side there is a second loreal above the normal one. The first and second superior labials are fused on one side, and all the superior labials posterior to the fourth on both sides. The inferior temporals of two rows are fused on one side, and there is but one above it in the second row, so that the formula is 2-2. Other specimens of the same size are entirely normal.

This handsome species ranges the Mississippi Valley, at no great distance on either side of the river, from Wisconsin to Texas, and it extends throughout northern Texas almost to the Pecos. It was originally described by Say, but remained unknown to other American naturalists until its rediscovery by Kennicott thirty-five years later.

rather broad, outer series not abruptly enlarged. In one specimen all] the black annuli to the middle of the tail are divided by the red, thus leaving the black as a margin to it; hence the number of these annuli is fewer. They are four scales wide behind the middle of the body. In another specimen only four anterior rings are completely divided, those on the following third of the length being divided by red on the sides; the remaining annuli black, three scales wide; white annuli one and onehalf scales; anterior, or nuchal, red annulus widest, its anterior black margin attaining parietals; an ochraceous band from gular region, not quite completed across parietals. Muzzle, prefrontal plates, and labial

This species has a longer body than the known red-ringed species, and is, indeed, most closely related to the O. boylii.. It will always be distinguished from the latter by the much more numerous annuli (twenty-eight in boylii).

This species occupies a position between the Osceola doliata and Ophibolus getulus boylii. Itis, in fact, an Ophibolus getulus boylii of slender form and reduced size, in which the black spaces between the white rings are more or less split by red. This division, when complete, gives the snake the appearance of the Osceola doliata occipitalis, and, to a somewhat less degree, of the O.d. coccinea. Such are specimens Cat. Nos. 8174, 4292, 10200. When the black is complete just at the middle line of the back, we have a form like O.d. gentilis, as Cat. No. 8435, In Cat. Nos. 7845, 11753, 13571 the red only appears on the anterior part of the body, and divides completely only a limited number of black rings behind the head. These approach nearest the Ophibolus g. boylit. The species further varies in the extent to which the black of the front covers the muzzle. The latter is white to the posterior part of the prefrontal scuta in Cat. Nos. 7845, 8174, 10200; it is speckled at the end and on the sides in Cat. Nos. 8435, 4292, and it is totally black in Cat. Nos. 11753, 13571. The yellow half collar crosses the posterior parts of the parietal plates in this species, advancing farther forward than in any of the subspecies of Osceola doliata excepting the 0. d. occipitalis.
The increased number of scales on the body and on the temporal region indicate that the affinities of this species are stronger with the Ophibolus boylit than with the Osceola doliata. It inhabits a hotter and a dryer region than the O. boylii, and as the conditions of the country are of later geologic origin than are those of California, the habitat of the O. boylii, we may conclude that it is a descendant of the latter. It appears in the dry southern part of California. It illustrates how, under a semitropical sun, a brilliant color makes its appearance little by little, and probably in a way totally different from that in which it appeared in the case of the Osceola doliata coccinea.

Form similar to that of Osceola gentilis, but the head and eye larger.

Head black above. Snout broader and more depressed than in Osceola gentilis. It is also

The black rings are each two scales wide on the vertebral region, narrowing to less than one scale laterally. On the fourth lateral row the two rings of each pair begin to diverge, the anterior uniting on theedge of the abdomen with the posterior ring of the pair in advance, the posterior becoming confluent with the anterior of the succeeding pair. Thus the the middle of the body these spots are two or three scales wide on the vertebral region, four or five on the sides, and but one on the first row of scales. Anteriorly the red intervals are greater; posteriorly they narrow slightly, but toward the tip of the tail they are entirely lost, as in Osceola doliata and gentilis, by the confluence of the black rings. The black rings extend but a short distance upon the abdominal scuta, leaving the abdomen destitute of blotches, though it is faintly and sparsely punctulated.

The number of rows of body and temporal scales and the more numerous rings will distinguish this species from Osceola doliata, and those above compared with it. From the Ophibolus pyrrhomelas it differs in the eight superior labial plates.

Head little distinct, conical, not depressed, the muzzle slightly compressed and the rostral plate projecting beyond the lower jaw. Rostral plate moderately recurved on the superior face of the muzzle. Frontal rather wide, produced posteriorly. Loreal small; oculars 1-2. The eye not large, resting on the third and fourth superior labials. Temporal scales 2-3-4, Superior labials seem higher than long, except the first, sixth,and seventh. Inferior labials ten, fifth largest; postgeneials shorter than pregeneials. Scales in from twenty-one to twenty-five rows, rather short, the sizes graduating insensibly. Tail short.
Ground color black, marked above and below with yellow or white spots and bands, the latter generally transverse, rarely longitudinal. Labial plates light colored, with dark borders. Top of head black, with larger or smaller white or yellow spots.
This species ranges the entire Nearctic Realm, as far north as about latitude 40°. It is not found in the Neotropical Realm, unless the Lower Californian district be émbraced in it.
The variability of this species is in some respects considerable, while in others it is quite constant. A number of distinct species have been proposed on its forms, most of which I felt compelled to reduce to this one as subspecies at the time of writing my Check-list in 1875. Further reduction is made now. The number of rows of scales is not constant. In the subspecies O. g. getulus they may be twenty-one or

<<<Page: 935>>>

twenty-three; and in the 0. g. boylit they may number twenty-three or twenty-five. The characters based on color indicate natural geographical subspecies, but the transitions from one to the other are not lacking. The subspecies are defined as follows:
1. Seales in 21 to 28 rows. Seales with yellow centers, sometimes collected into cross bands on the back; head yjellow-spotted above oss see sereseee eta bise eels cieeestecei O. g. sayi.

Black, with more or less numerous longitudinal stripes above and on the sides; parts of annuli present or absent; top of head black; top of muzzle white. O. g. california.
The geographical distribution of these subspecies is well defined. Thus the 0.9. sayi belongs to the Austroriparian region west of the Allegheny Mountains, and of the central region north to latitude 429. The O. g. getulus occupies the Austroriparian and Eastern regions north to about latitude 42°. The 0.4. splendidus is the type of the Sonoran
_district, and the 0. q. boylii of the Pacific. The O. 9. californie probably comes from the Lower Californian, but our specimens came from the southern part of the Pacific region.
This is the largest species of the genus, and is beautiful in all its forms. It is thoroughly harmless to mankind and can be handled to any extent without showing fear or anger.

Body, as in most of the other species, very tense and rigid, with difficulty capable of being extended after immersion in aleohol. Vertieal plate triangular, wider than long; outer edge slightly convex, an angle being faintly indicated at the junction of the superciliaries and occipitals; shorter than the occipitals, which are short, longer than broad. Postfrontals large, broad; anterior smaller. Rostral small, not projecting, slightly wedged between prefrontals, Eye very small, orbit

about as high as the labial below it; center of the eye a little anterior to the middle of the commissure, over the junction of the third and fourth labials. One anteorbital, vertically quadrate; loreal half its height, square. Upper labials seven, increasing to the penultimate. Lower labials nine; fourth and fifth largest.
Scales nearly as high as long, hexagonal, truncated at each end. Dorsal rows twenty-one, exterior rather larger, and diminishing almost imperceptibly to the back, although all the scales in a single oblique row are of very nearly the same shape and size.
The scales on the back and sides are lustrous black, each one with a ~ central elliptical or subcircular spot of ivory white, which on the sides occupy nearly the whole of the scale, but are smaller toward the back,

where they involve one-half to one-third of the length. Beneath yellowish white, with broad distinct blotches of black, more numerous posteriorly. Skin between the scales brown. The plates on the top and sides of the head have each a yellowish blotch; the labials are yellow, with black at their junction.
Other specimens agree except in having bright yellow instead of white as described; the spots, too, are rather smaller, and manifest a slight tendency to aggregation on adjacent scales, so as to form transverse bands. This is seen more decidedly where the back is crossed by about seventy short dotted yellow lines; the fifty-sixth opposite the anus. The scales between have very obsolete spots of lighter, scarcely discernible. The sides are yellow, with black spots corresponding to

<<<Page: 937>>>

the dorsal lines; indeed, there may be indistinctly discerned two or three lateral series of alternating blotches.
In larger specimens from the West, this tendency in the spots to aggregation is still more distinct. The back is crossed by these dotted lines of the number and relation indicated, at intervals of four or five scales; the spots on the intervening space being obsolete. These lines bifureate at about the ninth outer row, the branches connecting with those contiguous, so as to form hexagons, and these extending toward the abdomen again, decussate on about the third outer row, thus inclosing two series of square dark spots on each side. These lateral markings are, however, not very discernible, owing to the confusion produced by the greater number of yellow spots. On the edge of the abdomen are dark blotches, one opposite each dorsal dark space, the centers of the scutelle being likewise blotched, but so as rather to alternate with those just mentioned.
Specimens from Indianola exhibit all varieties of coloration.

Black, crossed by about thirty narrow, continuous yellow lines, which bifurcate on the flanks, the very obtuse angles embracing on each side a series of very much elongated patches, and in fact, by the union of the branches with each other, dividing the back into a succession of large black hexagons.
Very similar in. general relations to O. sayi, although the body appears rather stouter, and the head and eyes somewhat larger in proportion. The color above is deep lustrous black, crossed by about thirty-three continuous yellow lines, the twenty-sixth opposite the anus. These lines, which on the middle of the back are narrow, onehalf or one scale in width, widen rapidly till they meet the lateral series of black blotches, when they extend longitudinally in either

direction, and anastomose with their fellows. On each side, and alternating with the dark inelosures on the back, is a series of deep black blotches, extending from the abdomen (where those of opposite sides are generally confluent) over the first and second outer rows of scales. These blotches are rounded above, five or six scales long, and separated from the nearest dark part of the back by one or one-half scale. The outer edge of the abdomen and the exterior dorsal rows between these blotches being yellow causes the chain pattern to be continuous, inclosing a series of elongated dorsal spots from seven to ten scales long and about seventeen wide. Center of abdomen largely blotched with black, usually confluent with the blotches already meutioned. The plates on the head are black, with yellow spots.
The pattern as here described is subject to some irregularities, the chain being sometimes broken, and the lines oblique, not transverse, and the dark blotches of opposite sides not truly opposite to each other.

In his pamphlet on the Serpents of New York (Albany, 1854), Professor Baird remarks that this species is quite maritime in its northern distribution, being rarely found in the Northern States excepting near the coast. It is occasionally seen in Long Island, New York, according to DeKay, and more frequently in eastern New Jersey. It is not cited by Dr. J. A. Allen in his Catalogue of the Reptiles and Batrachians found in the vicinity of Springfield, Massachusetts,! nor is it included in the list of species found in the State which is included in the paper. In its western distribution it is not known from west of the Mississippi River.
This form is said to be an enemy and devourer of other snakes, espe— cially of the venomous Crotalide. I have not personally met with a case of it. It is entirely inoffensive to man, making no hostile demonstrations. My daughter, when a girl of six or eight years, had several individuals as pets. They drank miik readily from a cup which she held in her hand.
Prof. O. P. Hay? says:
It is extremely active and strong. Holbrook says of it thatit is found abundantly in moist and shady places, although it never takes to -water or trees. It feeds on moles, small birds, or such reptiles as lizards, salamanders, toads, and the like, that fallin its way. He further says that it is commonly believed that it is the great enemy of the rattlesnake, but there is no great evidence of this. He, however, tells of one that had as a fellow-prisoner a Crotalophorus milarius, or Southern ground rattlesnake, and swallowed him. I found that in Mississippi this snake had the reputation of destroying rattlesnakes, and it received protection on this account. Dr. Elliott Coues* says that the black snake (Zamenis constrictor) and Ophibolus getulus sayi wage a constant warfare against rattlesnakes and moccasins. They are said to be uniformly victorious and to eat their victims. It is on account of their prowess in thus destroying peisonous serpents that they have received the name of king snake. Mr. J. T.

larger body. The moccasin was killed, its bones crushed, and, beginning at the head, the king snake swallowed 16 inches of the moccasin’s body. Chloroform was then adininistered and both snakes preserved. The king snake had previously, while in captivity, eaten seven snakes. Dr. Yarrow! describes a specimen of getulus in the National Museum that has two perfect heads. One head is a little larger than the other. The two gullets unite to pass into th. one stomach.
The following is Yarrow’s description of the black form of this subspecies called by him Ophibolus getulus niger:
Color entirely black, with the exception of the under part of the head; upper and lower labial marked like the typical O. getulus getulus. Head plates entirely black, not spotted, and in one of the specimens examined light central spots on the head scales are to be seen. Frontals, parietals, and superciliaries more elongated and narrower than in the normal type; frontals and prefrontals about the same. Abdominal scutelle plumbeous, white spotted, not yellow. A peculiarity of the type specimens from which this description is prepared is that the third, fourth, and fifth postabdominal scutelle:
are entire, not divided; but this last trait Fig. 228.
has been noticed in other species of the OPHIBOLUS GETULUS LINN.©US. genus. In the specimen described, on the Black variety. second and third row of scales are a few Cat. No. 12029, U.S.N.M.
sparsely scattered white spots resembling
those of O. getulus sayi, but there is no approach to regularity, nor is there any indieation of a pattern. Seven upper labials on both sides; nine lower on one, ten on the other; twenty-one rows of scales, one anteorbital, two postorbitals. Length, 4 feet 6 inches, ;
_ A younger specimen, 3 feet 4 inches long, is similar in appearance to the older one, but there seems to be a tendency to a greater display of the white spots on the sides. Color of the back, lustrous black; belly dull black, with milk-white maculations. Isolated and minutely punctulated spots on the back show a decided approach to a pattern of coloration as in O.g. getulus.

It is uncertain whether this form is a true subspecies or not. The transition between it and the O.g. sayi is seen in Cat. No. 2362 of the latter, from Tennessee, where the spots are very few in number.

varieties of 0. g. sayi and 0. g. getulus. There is a series of dorsal black blotches from head to tail; in one specimen sixty-three, the forty-ninth opposite the anus; in the other, fifty-two, the forty-first opposite the anus. These are four or five scales long and six or seven wide. The lighter intervals between are constituted by one or two transverse rows _ of spots, each one on a separate scale. ‘The scales on the sides (from the first to the seventh or eighth rows) are black, each one with an elongated white blotch in the center. These blotches occupy nearly the whole scale on the exterior row, but diminish in amount toward the back. A series of rhomboidal darker spots is seen on each side opposite the light intervals, produced by the less amount of white on the scales at that place, and sometimes extend to the abdomen. The ~

abdomen is white, blotched not very deeply with black two or three scales wide, and a continuation of the dark shade in the prolongation of the lateral rhomboids. The blotches of the opposite sides are sometimes confluent and sometimes alternate. In one specimen the black patches are rather wider, extending nearly to the abdomen. Head less blotched with yellow than O. g?boylii. Differs from O. g. boylit in having the light intervals in the form of spots in the centers of dark scales, instead of covering the whole space. The lateral blotches are alternate with those of the back, not continuous and opposite. The blotches are more numerous.

This form approaches near to those of the O. g. sayi with transverse rows of spots on the median dorsal region. The head and nape are much less spotted than in the latter, and I have not found any variation in the different scale formulas of the two.

row of scales, where they begin to widen, so as to embrace from five to seven scales on the outer row. They continue of this width to the middle of the abdomen, where they are either confluent with the white of the opposite side, or are opposite to the black interval on the other side. The black interval between the cross bands is some eight to ten scales long, narrowing on the sides as the white spaces enlarge, until on the outer dorsal rows it occupies them to four scales, and is continued to the middle of the abdomen; owing to a slight obliquity of the dark patches on the back their abdominal extensions are very apt to alternate with each other on the middle of the abdomen, instead of being directly opposite and confluent.

The variety which I called conjunctus differs from the typical boylit in having the white scales black at the base, so that the annulate pattern

is much obscured, and a slight approximation to the subspecies splendidus is presented. According to Van Denburgh the young can not be distinguished from that of 0. g. boylii. On the other hand, the type called by Yarrow multicinctus has the white cross bands more numerous than in the typical L. g. boylii.
This hand:ome form inhabits regions of diverse climate, ranging from the comparatively rainy region of northern California to the dry southern extremity of Lower California and the arid deserts of southerm Arizona and southern Nevada. It has not been taken east of Arizona. The form conjunctus is from the southern extremity of Lower California, while the multicinctus type is from southern California.
Dr. Merriam, in his report on the Death Valley Expedition, gives the following note in regard to the distribution of this species:
This large and conspicuous snake, whose cream-colored body is sharply marked by rings of black, was first found in the valley of the Lower Muddy, near an abandoned mill at Overton, Nevada, where several were secured in dense thickets of Atriplex torreyi. About dark they began to emerge from these retreats, making a great noise in crawling over the dry leaves, and were soon found in the open. The species was obtained also in Pahranagat Valley, Nevada, a little north of the
middle of the valley. On the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, in California, specimens were collected in Kern Valley, at Three Rivers, and on the east fork of Kaweah
River.

Plates of the head similar to those of O. getulus boyli: One anteorbital, three postorbitals, seven upper labials, ten lower labials, twentythree rows of scales on body; difference, so far as the head is concerned, being an increase in number of postorbitals and lower labials.
Color markedly different from the type of O. getulus boyli. The first white annulus, three scales wide, begins eleven scales posteriorly to the parietals. There is then an interval of five scales to the third white annulus, which, instead of passing down toward the abdomen, expands at the

Eight seales behind this ring a longitudinal white line one and one-half scales wide commences, which extends the length of body to opposite the two hundred and seventh abdominal seute, or about the thirtieth from the anus. This line is absolutely continuous, but breaks off into annuli at the place mentioned. There are then a triangular white blotch, three annuli, another blotch, and

the dorsal line begins again, and ends at the tip of the tail. At distances of four and seven seales below this dorsal line, on both sides, are indications of lines, which are nearly complete in one of the specimens; in others they are broken into whitish blotches longitudinally arranged. Color of head and upper part of body pitchy. lustrous black; middle, lower third, and tail blackish brown.
This subspecies presents a very different facies from the O. getulus boylii. The head and neck resemble 0. g. boylii in markings and coloration, but the appearance of the body and tail is entirely different.

The transition between this form and the 0. g. boylii is accomplished by specimens Cat. Nos. 11747-87. In these the crossbands are numerous; in the former there are four on the anterior part of the body and seven on the posterior part anterior to the tail, the latter being also crossbanded. In Cat. No. 11787 a longitudinal median stripe extends through much of the length, but the sides have vertical blotches representing the corresponding crossbands on the O. q. boylii.
In De Blainville’s type of this species there are no transverse bands, and the lateral stripes are but little interrupted. The dorsal stripe is, on the other hand, interrupted at several points.
In a specimen without locality in the U. 8S. National Museum, the body and tail are black above and yellowish-white below. A pure white stripe runs on the vertebral line from the nape to the end of the tail, and another on the first and second rows of scales on the anterior four-fifths of the length. Mr. Van Denburgh describes a specimen from Cape St. Lucas which is black above and below, including the head, except a cinnamon-colored vertebral stripe and some cinnamon-colored spots on the nape and on the superior aspect of the tail, where the stripe is wanting.

Body slender, cylindrical; tail short; head not distinet from body. Rostral prominent, but not recurved; no prefrontals or loreals. One — nasal. Scales smooth. No scale pits. Anal entire. Teeth smooth.
This genus is probably a degraded ally of Ophibolus. Dr. Stejneger suggested an affinity to that genus, and my examination of the penial structure confirms this view. It is interesting to find the only species in Florida, where occurs also the Osceola elapsoidea, the most reduced form of its genus.

Kye moderately small. One nasal, with nostril in tha center. Prefrontals large, in contact with the second and third labia. and forming, with the latter, the anterior border of the orbit. Frontal hexagonal, the anterior angle obtuse. Superciliaries short and broad. Parietals large, bounding the postorbitals behind and touching the fifth labial. Two small postorbitals, the lower one resting on a notch between the fourth and fifth labials. Three temporals in a horizontal series, the first lying between the fifth and sixth Jabials and the

Nineteen rows of dorsal scales, lozenge shaped and perfectly smooth. Abdominal scutelle, 235-260. Subcaudals small, in 40-44 pairs. Ground color silvery-gray, with sixty-one dorsal spots of dark brown with blackish border, from head to anus, and eleven on the tail. Anteriorly the spots are from two to four scales long and from five to seven wide, posteriorly becoming smaller. The interspaces are about equal in length to two spots and have the three median rows of scales mottled with pale red. Under surface of body silvery-gray, much blotched with black, which runs up on the three exterior rows of scales, opposite the intervals between the dorsal spots. On the sides each light scale is finely punctuated with black. An elongated triangular dark patch on the parietals pointing backward, and a small dark blotch just below it on each side of the neck. A dark bar running back from the

eye on the upper margin of the labials. The fore part of the head and chin and throat much maculated with black.
Measurements.—Total length of specimen, 532 mm. (21 inches); length of tail, 50 mm. (2 inches).
Dr. Stejneger! remarks on this subject as follows:
The type specimen of Stilosoma extenuatum is described as possessing no separate prefrontals (these being fused with the internasals), no loreal, and no preoculars. The large internasals join the supralabials and enter the eye, and the parietals join the supralabials behind the postoculars, excluding the temporals from the latter.
The three additional specimens seem to prove that the only normal and stable characters among the above are the absence of the loreal and the joining of the parietals and supralabials. The absence of the preocular is only found in *he type, while the fusion of the internasals with the prefrontals is found in the type and in one of the Orange County specimens as well, but not in the other two, in which they are normally separated.

The typical specimen still continues to be the only one known.
This species so much resembles the Contia mitis as to lead to the suspicion that its generic peculiarities are abnormalities of the head scuta. The relations of the loreal plate are, however, symmetrical, and the frontal plate is wider than in the C. mitis. The coloration is identical in alcohol. The head is relatively shorter; and to this fact are to be ascribed its tegumental peculiarities. It isin any case a type of recent origin.

Body slender, cylindrical, tense, and rigid. Dorsal scales rhomboidal, rather elongated. Vertical plate very large, cordiform or subhexagoual. almost as broad anteriorly as long; obtuse angled before, acute angled behind; the two outer sides short, parallel. Occipitals large, a little

Kye small, its center over the third labial, and over the middle of the commissure. Postorbitals two; anteorbital one. The superciliaries are very small and narrow, in one specimen looking like an upper postorbital. One line of temporal shields. Loreal small. One nasal; nostril situated in its center, with a rounded groove to the lower edge, sometimes to the upper, apparently separating two nasals. Upper labials six, the third constituting the greater portion of the orbit below, with the lower postorbital resting upon it and on the second; all the labials nearly equal in size, fourth and fifth largest. Lower labials eight, fifth largest.
The back and sides are embraced by about twenty elongated longitudinal black rings (the sixteenth opposite the anus), their anterior and posterior sides on the dorsal line, their lateral resting on the outer dorsalrow. Across the back the black is well defined and continuous, about two scales long; on the sides, however (from the first to the third rows), the black is interrupted more or less, sometimes reduced to a few scattered scales. The intervals between the successive rings are yellow, with the centers of the scales dusky (they sometimes have only a narrow margin of yellowish), and on the sides may be seen a distinct rhomboidal black spot opposite each dorsal light interval. This is sometimes broken up and confused with the black of the rings on the sides. The large spaces inclosed by the rings themselves are yellowish red (said to be crimson in life), six to nine scales long, and about thirteen wide; they are variable in length, being larger at about the anterior third than elsewhere. Beneath uniform yellowish white. The first ring crosses just behind the occipital plates, and in front of it is a narrow black band crossing the middle of the occipitals, from one angle of the mouth to the other, sometimes connected with the first ring by a narrow black line. Rest of the head yellowish. Another specimen has twenty-six rings, the twentieth opposite the anus.
A specimen from Prairie Mer Rouge has the whole lower wall of the orbit constituted by the third labial, with both anterior and posterior orbitals resting upon it. The vertical is more elongated. The anterior dorsal ring, instead of being continuous, is divided anteriorly, and the ends, after approximating, are bent back on the occipitals and extend to the eye. The snout, too, is rather more pointed. In a second speci-

men from the same locality the third labial only enters the eye on one side, and the second and third on the other, in the usual way.
In this species the loreal plate makes various approaches to the border of the orbit, in some instances entering it, according to Professor Jan, who figures it in a specimen from Tennessee. He regards the character as indicating a species which he calls Cemophora copei; but in a Floridian specimen the character is so intermediate as to show that it has no systematic value.
The Cemophora coccinea is a species of the Austroriparian region, but it has not been found in the Texan district, nor does it ascend the Mississippi River as far as the region extends. It is especially abundant in Florida.

tion of the fourth and fifth upper labials, about opposite the middle of the commissure. Postorbitals two, lower in noteh between the fifth and sixth labials, although resting more on the latter. Anteorbital large, resting on the fourth labial, the fourth and fifth labials constituting equally the inferior part of the orbit. Loreal elongated, horizontal, trapezoidal; well developed. Nasals apparently double, perhaps a single one very much excavated. Two temporal shields between the occipitals and Jabials. Labials eight above, seventh largest; eight below, fifth largest. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three, all perfectly smooth ; scales rhomboidal, nearly equal, but rather narrow above. Abdominal scutelle two hundred and six; posterior one entire. Subcaudal scutellze forty, all entire.
The body is crossed by about thirty-three quadrate black blotches, the twenty-seventh opposite the anus. These are nearly of the same length, and of the same distance apart throughout, four scales long, and extending between the second external rows, where their sides are rather rounded or angulated. The black is very deep and continuous

on the four or five central rows of scales, whence to the flanks it is varied by having the centers of each scale reddish yellow. The intervals between the blotches are exactly the reverse; above they are uniform pale red, aud on the sides the centers of each scale are black. Sometimes scattered black scales may be observed on the back in the light spaces. Beneath yellowish white, unspotted. The two outer rows of scales of the same color, but with a short black bar extending from the middle of each light and each dark space, perpendicularly to the abdomen, the extreme edge of which is sometimes involved. The head and half its length behind are black, spotted with yellowish on the sides. The snout and labials yellowish, the plates nargined with black.

This species displays remarkable variations in coloration. In Cat. No. 5168 the large blotches are perfectly distinct, and their lateral interspaces have but faint traces of markings. In Cat. Nos. 2020, 2023, 2030, 2031, 11743, 11784, all of small size, and Cat. No. 2016, fully grown, there is a vertical black spot between the dorsal blotches on each side. In Cat. Nos. 8376, 4471, 4472 the entire space on the sides between the dorsal blotches is marked with a black spot on the center of each scale. Cat. Nos. 8021 and 8022 are more like the first noted variety, but carry the peculiarity further. The dorsal blotches are perfectly distinct from each other and are truncate, and not narrowed at their inferior border. Very few of the scales have light centers, and there are no intermediate lateral spots. Belly spots sparse. In Cat. No. 8022 a wide longitudinal median black band forms, with the occipital spot, an anchor-shaped figure. This variety is approached nearly by the second and only other ~ species of the genus, the R. antonii Dugés, which has the black crossbands fewer in number and wider. It is from Mazatlan. Individuals also differ in the relative size of the loreal plate and number of crossbars. In one from the Canadian River there are thirty-seven rings; in one from the Llano Estacado twenty-six. In another from the same locality the abdomen is black, tessellated; in all others, white.
The range of the Rhinochilus lecontei is throughout the Sonoran district. The most eastern and northern locality known for it is Garden City, in southwestern Kansas, where Professor Cragin, of Topeka, obtained a specimen. It presents the anomaly of having the loreal plate to enter the orbit below the preocular.
Mr. S. W. Garman! names a “var. tessellatus,” with the sole description: “Labials, eight. Infralabials, ten. Ventrals, one hundred and seventy-eight. Subcaudals, thirty-seven entire, plus fourteen pair.”

In this genus we have a reduction of the cephalic pholidosis in a type which has its extreme representative in the burrowing genus Ficimia, It stands in general features allied to some of the species of Chionactis, as the C. episcopus, and Boulenger unites it with his partly synonymous Contia. Chionactis has internasal plates, while they are absent in Conopsis, with anomalous exceptions. In Contia there are no grooved teeth. But one species of Conopsis is known.

Upper surface of body olivaceous, spotted toward the front with black. Head slightly convex in the prefrontal region. Rostral a little depressed and pointed at the extremity to form an angle when viewed in profile, but rounded transversely. Two well-developed prefrontals.Frontal hexagonal, longer than wide, having an obtuse angle in front and an acute one behind. The parietals rather wide, and relatively short. Seven supralabials, the third and fourth outlining the inferior border of the ocular disk. Nasal pierced in the middle and not in contact with the preocular, where the loreal is wanting or reaching it by an angle only. Loreal square. One preocular, two postoculars. Three temporals, the first a little larger than the two following. Two pairs of geneials, the second much shorter than the first, and separated from each other by a scutella. Six inferior labials, the first four in contact with the anterior geneial. Four or five pairs of gular scales, followed by 110-134 gastrosteges, of which the first two or three are rather narrow. Tail a little longer in the males than in the females, having on the under side 29-38 urosteges. Trunk scales convex behind, arranged in 17 median longitudinal series. Measurements.—Total length of a male specimen, 266 mm.; length from the end of muzzle to anus, 217 mm.; length of tail, 49 mm. Upper surfaces of the body olive yellow, spotted with small angular black marks, which are arranged in indistinct longitudinal lines. Below the eye, on the fourth supralabial, there is sometimes a blackish spot. The lower surfaces are yellowish white, with gray dots at the right and left of the ventrals and caudals. : This species is subject to variations consisting of the fusion or abortion of plates. The loreal plate is occasionally absent on one or both

<<<Page: 959>>>

sides, and rarely the postoculars may be fused, and two superior labials may be equally rarely fused. According to Giinther and Boulenger the forms with internasal plates are only variations of this species, and the form of the rostral may vary from obtusely rounded to angulate, and to angulate with concave superior surfaces. That this incredible range of variations is characteristic of this species is sustained by the existence, according to these authors, of two individuals in the British Museum in which the internasal is present on one side and absent on the other. The great majority of specimens are, however, according to these authors, constant in these respects. Thus Boulenger enumerates thirteen individuals with internasals present on both sides and sixteen in which they are absent on both sides. Under such circumstances the irregularity in question would seem to be rather an anomaly than an indication that all the specimens belong to one species. This view is confirmed by ten specimens at my disposal which come under the definition of Conopsis nasus as given by Boulenger. Five, which I refer to the C. nasus, constantly lack internasals, and five which I refer to Toluca lineata, Chionactis diasti, and Chionactis varians, as constantly possess them. All possess loreals except the two individuals of Toluca lineata, where the nasal articulates with the preocular; and one side of two individuals of Conopsis nasus, where, on the contrary, the nasal terminates posteriorly in an acute angle, not reaching the preocular.
The small black dorsal spots are obsolete in four of the five specimens before me. These were sent me by M. Boueard, of Paris, without especial indication of locality.

The shallowness and position of the groove of the last maxillary tooth in this genus does not entitle it to be placed in the Opisthoglypha. It may be perhaps in a condition from which the true groove of the opisthoglyphous tooth may have arisen.

This is a characteristic species of western Texas. It is common west of Fort Worth to Fort Concho and about Helotes in the south. It exhibits a great range of color variation, since it is evident that the C. isozonus must be reckoned as one of its varieties. Thus its range extends to Utah and Arizona.

Lower labials seven; the fourth very much the largest. The dorsal scales in fifteen rows; they increase regularly in size from the central rows, which are much the smallest, to the first lateral row, which is higher than long. The color of the entire upper parts of head and body is uniform light olive brown tinged with green, but on close inspection each scale is seen to be very minutely mottled with black toward the center, and upon stretching the skin the base of each scale is black. A rose-colored vertebral stripe in life. The abdomen is uniform whitish green. Ina specimen from Rio Seco the exposed base of each scale is black, giving the body somewhat of an indistinctly mottled appearance even when the skin is not stretched. The colors become lighter after soaking long in alcohol, and the black at the bases of the scales becomes more or less effaced.

I have also numerous specimens from West Texas from between Fort Worth and Fort Concho on the north to San Antonio on the south. Twelve of these are from the Wichita River and were collected by Jacob Boll. Of these, seven are normal, three have no loreal on one side, and one has no loreal on both sides; one has two temporals of the anterior row instead of one. A specimen from a more western locality, San Angelo, Texas, is anomalous in having no loreals, and in having the two postoculars fused into one on both sides.

Light yellowish brown above, with a median undefined orange band. Top of bead from anterior part of frontal plate to near posterior border of parietals black. A black half collar behind the parietal plates extending to the third row of scales on each side, exclusive.
In one specimen the third and fourth rows of scales black at their bases, forming a double lateral stripe, extending from the end of the half collar to beyond the middle of the body. Ina second specimen these lines are absent. Lips and below, immaculate. Gastrosteges one hundred and forty-three; anal divided; urosteges thirty-eight.
I have but two specimens of this variety, of which one is known to be trom northwestern Texas, and the other of uncertain locality, but probably from the sameregion. In the smaller, the third superior labial is almost excluded from the orbit; in the latter tt has the usual share. In the latter also the top of the head is brown, as is often the case in the usual variety.
Boulenger has regarded this species as distinct in consequence of my ascription of 183 gastrosteges to it. This number, which appears in my original description, is a typographical error for 143.

I have a specimen from Prof. W. T. Cummins from the Tule Canyon in the Staked Plain of Texas.
I suspect that the Sonora semiannulata of Baird and Girard was established on an abnormal specimen of this species. That specimen is remarkable in having the superciliary plate divided symmetrically on each side by a suture, which cuts off a plate whose apex reaches the parietal, and which Baird and Girard term a third postocular. The muzzle was somewhat wrinkled, so as to produce folds of the integument. This led to the mistaken belief that the nasal is divided. Omitting these two characters, there remains only a slightly more protuberant rostral plate, which is not more, in my opinion, than an individual peculiarity. The coloration is identical with that of the C.e. isozonus. More specimens will be necessary to settle the question definitely. Should the identification here suggested prove necessary, the name of the species will stand as Chionactis semiannulatus, with the subspecies episcopus, torquatus, and semiannulatus.
This form is further variable. In Cat. No. 14096 the number of gastrosteges and urosteges is less than in the C. e. isozonus; the nasal and loreal plates are of different shapes, and the rostral is more prominent. The color is also different. Otherwise the plate and scale forms are the same. .
The rostral is narrower when viewed from above, and is more produced both forward and backward. The nasal is produced backward

<<<Page: 965>>>

to a narrow but obtuse angle. Loreal minute, with an acute apex forward. First temporal longer than deep; it is as deep as long in C. e. isozonus. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-four; urosteges, forty; the latter vary from fifty to fifty-three in the C. e. isozonus. ~ The ground color is similar to that of the C. episcopus, and there are black crossbars which are less numerous and narrower than in the C. e. isozonus. There are twenty-two on the body and some obsolete specks on the tail. Lower surfaces everywhere immaculate. The crossbars appear as spots on the fourth and fifth rows of scales, and are better defined between these rows, and are one and a half to two scales wide. In C.e. isozonus the black bands are three and four scales wide and are equidistant, and those of the tail are distinct on both superior and inferior surfaces. Measurements.—Total length, 238 mm.; tail, 44 mm.

Head slightly wider than neck. Rostral plate prominent, anguiate in profile, rounded from above, superior surface with a small concavity, and equal to two-thirds the length of the distance to the frontal plate. Occipitals longer than frontal, lateral borders concave posteriorly, and emarginate at the point of junction behind. Nostril pierced anterior to middle of nasal plate, which is truncate posteriorly and in contact with the subquadrate loreal. Oculars 1-2; temporals 1-2; three temporals bounding the occipitals larger than nuchal scales. Superior labials seven, all higher than long. Pregeneials rather elongate, bordered by four inferior labials, of which the fourth is the largest of the series. Postgeneials very small, separated by a scale. Gastrosteges one hundred and thirty-six; urosteges, thirty.
Measurements.—Total length, 272 mm.; length of tail, 39 mm.; length to canthus oris (axial), 10 mm.
Ground color above brown, with small spots longitudinally arranged ; below yellowish unspotted. In the specimen in the national collection there is a series of small, brown, light-edged spots on the middle dorsal line, which cover the halves or wholes of two scales both transversely and longitudinally. On each side of these is a more indistinct smaller dark-brown spot which may be confluent with them; and further laterally there are traces of another series of spots. The brown ground color is produced by a dense speckling or reticulation of deep brown on a lighter ground, and these fine markings cover the cephalic scutes, and extend to the extremities of the gastrosteges. According to Bocourt there are sometimes three very indistinct longitudinal stripes?
This species is well distinguished from the other members of the genus by the form of its occipital plates, and by the longer pregeneials. The same characters distinguish it from the Conopsis nasus. The coloration is also characteristic. The form of the occipital shields is only partially displayed in Bocourt’s figure, as cited, and none of my specimens of the C. nasus have even the small posterior emargination shown in Bocourt’s figure of that species. In the regular rotundity of the outline of the occipitals the Conopsis nasus agrees with the species of Chionactis excepting C. varians.

PSEUDOFICIMIA Bocourt. Pseudoficimia Bocourt, Miss. Sci. Mexique, Reptiles, 1883, p. 572.
Grooving of posterior maxillary teeth obsolete. Nasal plate divided below the nostril, which is below the internasal suture. Internasal plates present; rostral prominent. Anal and subcaudals divided. Pupil round.
This genus is nearly allied to Chionactis, but the teeth can not be said to be grooved, and the nasal is partly divided. For these reasons I formerly referred the typical species P. frontalis to Geagras, but Dr. Boulenger points out that that genus is characterized by the position of the nostril at the junection-ef the nasals and internasal, which is not the case in this species. But one species of this genus is known.

Color below uniform pale yellow; above grayish brown, becoming more rufous medially, with about thirty-six rhombic, dark-edged brown spots, six scales wide and four long, whose angles are produced as vertical lateral bars. Together they become nearly crossbands posteriorly, when they are separated by a pale spot on the vertebral line. A brown cross-band across prefrontals and frontal; a longitudinal band on each occipital and side of nape.
This is one of the species which range from the Sierra Caliente at Colima to the Austroccidental plateau at Guadalaxara.

Size small, body stout, subceylindrical, deeper than wide. Tail short and thick. Head short and broad, wedge shaped, almost continuous with the body. Snout much depressed, acutely pointed, and projecting beyond the lower jaw. Crown arched throughout. Cephalic plates normal. Frontal very large, subhexagonal, the anterior extremity elongated in a narrow process to the internasals, thus widely separating the prefrontals. Occipitals shorter than frontal, nearly as broad as long. Superciliaries small. Rostral proportionally large, turned back upon the crown, the apex obtusely pointed, and its center forming the acute point of the nose, not concave above. Nasal pentagonal, much elongated, pointed posteriorly. No loreal. One small subpentagonal anteorbital, as long as high; two postorbitals, upper slightly largest; seven upper labials, all higher than long, first much smaller than the second and succeeding rows; lower labials, six. Temporals, 1-2.
Dorsal scales in seventeen rows, smooth. The scales of the first lateral rows are higher than long; those of the central rows narrower, the outer row largest. Postabdominal scutella divided; subcaudal all divided. Color above uniform Jight brownish ash, with three imperfect longitudinal blackish stripes, each on a single row of scales.
Besides the typical specimen I obtained a second from the Valley of Toluca, which agrees with it in all respects. I am not therefore inclined to agree with Boulenger that the characters it presents are anomalous, and that it is a form of Conopsis nasus. Besides the four plates in front of the frontal, and the postfrontals separated by the frontal, the coloration is also characteristic. The Conopsis lineatus of Bocourt is a different species in my estimation, and, owing to the presence of two pairs of regular plates on the muzzle, and a loreal, referable to the genus Ogmius.

This genus introduces us to a type which is especially Mexican, and which includes the genera Ficimia Gray, Ogmius Cope, and Conopsis Giinther. Stenorhina Duméril and Bibron is probably so allied, as well as perhaps Geagras Cope. They all have protuberant rostral shields, which are in the first three genera named more or less recurved. Besides the G. canum, there is but one species of Gyalopium, the G. publium Cope,' which has been found in Yucatan.

This genus of burrowing snakes is analogous to Stenorhina in the union of the nasal and prefrontal shields. The form of the muzzle and inferior position of the mouth indicate affinity to Chionactis.
There are three species, which differ as follows:

This species resembles the C. ephippicus in general appearance, but the seutellation is very different. In the wide separation of the nasal and preocular plates it resembles the C. stramineus, but it differs from both species in the more numerous inferior labials and larger pregeneials.

These wie: spots are about forty-eight in number, upon the body; they extend transversely from the seventh to the fifteenth rows of scales, and are three or four scales in length. On the posterior part of the body they sometimes divide longitudinally, their moieties alternating or becoming confluent into a zigzag band. Alternating with these on each side is a series of small spots formed by the brown borders of scales of the fifth and sixth rows. Another series of small spots opposite to the dorsal row is formed by the shading of the adjacent borders of the fourth and fifth rows with the same color. Many of the scales of the second row are also tipped with brown. There is a large brown spot on each side of the neck, sometimes confluent with an elongate central one, which extends to the occipital plates. A brown stripe passes from the eye to the neck spot, entirely covering the last upper labial. Top of the head brownish gray, indistinctly spotted with pale brown. Labial plate paler; frontals and rostral ochreous. Beneath yellowish white, immaculate.

This form occurs in Lower California, Sonora, and Chihuahua.
The form which I described as H. chlorophea differs in its colors somewhat from the usual type. It is found in Arizona. Its characters are as follows:
Number of labials and rows of scales the same as in the last species. The scales of the body are, however, more elongate, and partly on this account are arranged in rows more oblique in an antero-posterior direction. The vertical plate is a little broader, and the head is narrower in proportion to its length. The body is rather more slender.
The color is a greenish ash, much darker than in the preceding species. The dorsal spots, instead of being brown, are black and separated by intervals of two scales in width. They are much smaller, occupying only the space from the ninth to the thirteenth longitudinal rows, and are one scale and a half long. They frequently divide and alternate, and their number on the body amounts to from fifty-eight to sixty-six. Two rows of smaller alternating spots appear on the sides, one upon the sixth and seventh rows of scales, the other on the fourth. The distribution of colors on the head and neck is much as is in the typical form, except that the neck spots are a little longer. The brown is, however, replaced by black, and the ochreous by olivaceous. The crown and muzzle are thickly punctuated with black. Beneath pale

This group is intermediate in penial character to several others. It is allied to the Calamarine through Grayia, and to the Dromicinze through Homalosoma. Pseudaspis shows resemblances in the hemipenis to the Natricine, and Anomalodon is similar to Homalopsis. I find that the flouncing of the penial structure is not sufficient to define the group as I at first thought.

The genus Natrix is the water-snake form of all temperate regions and of tropical Asia. The European NV, natrix is terrestrial for the most part, but the North American and Indian species are very aquatic, diving to the bottom of the water to escape enemies on the Shore. The genus Hutenia, for the most part North American, includes many species of terrestrial habits, and they are all often found far from water. The LH. saurita takes to the water if alarmed. A number of North American genera are degenerate forms of Natricine, which have adopted a terrestrial and even a burrowing life like that of the Calamarine. Storeria is like a Natrix reduced in the lateral head plates and with feeble jaws. Tropidoclonium is related in the same way to Hutenia. Haldea and Amphiardis have a more decidedly fusiform character. Haldea displays the hypopophyses continued to the caudal region, as in the other members of the subfamily.
The African members of the family are few in number, as but one species of Natrix (N. mortuarius) occurs there.

Teeth generally longer on the posterior than the anterior parts of of the maxillary bone, ungrooved. ‘Two internasal, two prefrontal, and two nasal scuta; one loreal; parietals distinct. Anal plate divided. Scales keeled; scale-pits double. Gastrosteges well developed, not angulated or keeled.

south as Vera Cruz from its North American range. In the Old World two species only, 7. mortuarius and T. ferox, are found in Africa, and several species occur in the Malaysian Archipelago. They are all aquatic in their habits, living chiefly in and on the shores of fresh waters and feeding on small fishes and other aquatic vertebrates, especially frogs. Some of these species grow to a considerable size, and often present a savage appearance, owing to the small eyes and wide gape of the mouth. Even in these specimens the teeth are not large enough to inflict more than slight and harmless scratches.
An allied genus accompanies this one in the East Indies (Amphiésma Duméril and Bibron), in which the scales have no pits. In North America another allied genus (Hutcnia) also has no pits, and is further characterized by the undivided condition of the anal scutum.
I find twelve well-distinguished species in North America, which are characterized as follows:

Of these species N. leberis and N. fasciata are distributed over both the Eastern and the Austroriparian districts. The other species belong to the Austroriparian district except the NV. valida, which is the only species of the Sonoran district. The N. grahamii extends up the Mississippi River to north of the Austroriparian limits to northern Ilinois and Indiana, and is not known from east of the latter State. 1. rhom

bifera has a similar distribution, except that it remains within the boundaries of the Austroriparian district, not extending north of southern Illinois and Indiana. N. cyclopiwm has not been found out of this district, while the N. compressicauda and N. usta are restricted to Florida. NV. taxispilota is confined to the eastern part of the Austroriparian region and Florida, while N. rigida has a similar range, omitting Florida, and apparently extending north to Pennsylvania. JN. bisecta is known from but one specimen.

The head is proportionally small, and conical forward. The eyes also are small. The frontal plate has the shape of an elongated quadrangle. The parietal plates are quite small in consequence of lateral and posterior subdivisions. Rostral low, twice as wide as high. Internasals much longer than wide; prefrontals nearly square. Superior labials eight, the middle of the orbit over the fourth plate, the fifth excluded by the lower postocular; sixth and seventh very large, sometimes subdivided. Inferior labials eleven, the seventh the largest. Postgeneials not larger than pregeneials. There are two large post

orbital plates. The superciliaries are narrow and elongated. Temporals more numerous than in any other species of the genus; two in the first row smooth, the remainder small, keeled, and nearly similar to the body scales.
Ground color reddish brown, with three series of subquadrangular blackish blotches about forty-six in number, the twenty-sixth opposite the anus.. They embrace transversely from seven to ten rows of scales, and longitudinally three scales on the two anterior thirds of the body, and two scales on the posterior third. The space between the blotches is equal to the blotches themselves. The lateral series are isolated ; that is to say, not contiguous to the dorsal series except sometimes toward the origin of the tail and along the latter region. The blotches extend over nine or ten lateral rows of scales, and affect from three to five scales. Equilateral on the anterior part of the body, they become narrower on the posterior part, and taper upward. The space between is narrower by one scale. On the tail the dorsal series of blotches has almost entirely disappeared; now and then an irregular patch may be seen confluent with the lateral series, which remain conspicuous to the very tip of that organ. The lower surface of the body is yellow, with irregular deep chestnut blackish-brown patches, the lateral ones contiguous to the lateral series. These may be so extended as to cover the greater part of the gastrosteges. Head uniform dark-brown; gular

This species is a very distinct one and is remarkable for various peculiarities. One of these is the great reduction in size of the parietal scuta, which frequently do not exceed the prefrontals in dimensions. This reduction has been supposed by Professor Heilprin to be exceptional in the species, and he has accordingly named a specimen front Florida as a variety brockii. The character is, however, normal in the species. The sixth and seventh superior labials are very large, and their superior portions are occasionally cut off, as in Cat. No. 13887. In Cat. No. 10700 there are abuormally three postoculars on both sides, but this abnormality reaches a remarkable degree in Cat. No. 6409. Here a complete circle of scales which surrounds the eye, as in JV. cyclopium, consists of three preoculars and four or five postoculars. There are ten superior labials, of which the last three are divided longitudinally. The frontal plate has an incomplete median groove and the parietals two incomplete grooves, pointing to a subdivision of head plates, such as occurs in some of the East Indian water snakes, as the genus Cerberus.

This is the largest American water snake. Its range is coextensive with the austroriparian subregion, extending from the Atlantic region from the Potomac River to Florida and west to Louisiana, inclusive.

not as narrow as in some species, superciliaries much narrowed anteriorly. Parietals large, obliquely truncated by a large second temporal, exceeding in length the muzzle in front of the frontal plate. Nasals short anteroposteriorly, the anterior elevated and narrow; postnasal making asuture with prefrontal. Loreal longer than high, very obliquebehind. Preocularone, postoculars two ; suboculars two, separating the orbit from the superior labial plates. Temporals one, three; the first long, bordering two labials and a scute; those of the second and third rows not keeled. Middle of eye above the fourth superior labial. Superior labials eight, sixth and seventh large, sixth twice as high as wide. Inferior labials twelve, the seventh largest. Postgeneials shorter than pregeneials.
Color brown above and yellow below. On the upper surfaces there are on each side two rows of alternating short crossbars of a darker color, which are about one and one-half scales wide, and are separated by interspaces of about three scales. The median line for a width of four scales is not spotted, or is very imperfectly so, forming a broad vertebral band of a color darker than the general ground. In young specimens the pattern is very distinctly seen, but in adults the ground becomes so dark as to obscure it very much. The head is uniform brown, the oral edge of the superior labial plates only being yellow. On the yellow ground of the inferior surfaces there appear, on the anterior third only of the length, dark shades on the anterior parts of the gastrosteges. These extend and blend so that on the posterior two-thirds of the length in the adult the color may be said to be blackish-brown with yellow spots.

This well-marked species is much less abundant than its allies, the N. rhombifera and N. taxispilota. The few specimens in the U. S, National Museum come from the three extreme points of the austroriparian districts, namely, Florida, New Orleans, and southern Illinois.
The NV. cyclopiwm is nearest the NV. rhombifera. The pattern of coloration is quite different, and the scutellation also differs in several important respects. In the WN. cyclopium the nasal plates are shorter anteroposteriorly, and there are only two scuta which are properly postocular. The posterior temporals are smoother and not heeled, and the large scales are emarginate, which they are not in the NV. rhombifera.
The possession of a series of scales below the orbit, while present in all known specimens of this species, is not confined to it. I have seen it in a specimen of the NV. tavispilota, and it is found in the only known specimen of the Natrix anoscopus” Cope, from Cuba.

Fifth excluded from the orbit by the inferior postoculars; sixth and seventh much larger than any of the others. Inferior labials eleven, fifth and sixth largest; postgeneials a Jittle longer than pregeneials. Ground color, above brown; below yellow. Above, three rows of transverse black spots, one on each side and one crossing the middle line, alternating with the laterals. The adjacent angles of the spots of the middle and lateral series are connected by oblique black bars, which thus inclose with the dorsal spots a series of transverse diamondshaped or hexagonal spaces of the ground color on the middle region of the back. The lateral interspaces are partly closed below by two semicircular spots of brown on the two gastrosteges below them; and the two gastrosteges below the lateral spots also have brown spots of a triangular form in continuation of them, The semicircular ventral

spots are nearer the middle line than the triangular. The middle line is unspotted or has but feeble traces of spots. I counted thirty-five dorsal and as many lateral spots on a specimen from New Orleans (Cat. No. 13354).
The head is a uniform brown above; and on the nape is an obscure chevron-shaped black mark, with an obtuse angle forward. The superior labials have black posterior borders and are tinged with yellow medially. The inferior labials are similar, but more distinctly yellow. Scales of gular region uniform yellow.

In thirteen specimens in which I counted the rows of scales I found but one in which the number is not twenty-seven. This wasin Cat. No. 10759, a small and starved individual, which had twenty-five rows. In dimensions this water snake rather exceeds the J. s. fasciata, and is only exceeded in one fauna by the NV. taxrispilota.
The Lower Mississippi is the headquarters of this species, where it is very abundant. It is not yet known from east of that river, but ranges north to the limits of the Austroriparian region to southern Illinois and west throughout Texas. It is the only one of our water snakes which extends to the Tierra Caliente of Mexico, having been brought by the exploration commission from Misantla, in the State of Vera Cruz..

These subspecies belong to the Austroriparian region, except JN. s. sipedon, which is nearly confined to the Eastern, and J. s. transversa, which belongs to the Texan district.
It is semiaquatic in its habits, being usually found on the border of the water, where it takes refuge when alarmed. It is an expert swimmer and a skillful fisher, since fishes form a large part of its food.It captures fishes by quick movements below the surface of the water. When cornered it is pugnacious, but its bite is insignificant. Its average adult length is three feet, but it frequently exceeds that size.

Ground color above in the adult uniform blackish brown, lighter in the young, crossed by transverse lozenge-shaped’ blackish patches irregularly tapering on the sides throughout the length. There are from thirty to thirty-eight subtriangular or vertical oblong red spots extending between three cross-bands to the abdominal seutelle. The twenty-sixth of these red markings is opposite to the anus, and twelve smaller ones may be observed along the tail, gradually diminishing posteriorly. A black vitta extends from the posterior rim of the eye to behind the angle of the mouth, above and below which a light elongated patch tinged with red may be seen. Labials dusky, margined with reddish brown. Belly yellowish or reddish, marked with

darker reddish spots on one side or the other, which are more or less black bordered, or the entire gastrostege may be black edged, and in some specimens the black edges are so wide as to cover almost all of the plate, so that the belly and under side of the tail are black. (Cat. Nos. 13024-13028; New Orleans.)
The number of spots crossing the back is very variable. They are usually wider than in the N. /. sipedon and in some individuals are of double or treble the width. In that case the interspaces have an oblique direction. Such specimens are most common in Louisiana, while those with short cross-bands, separated by narrow intervals, are more usual in Florida. In a specimen from Volusia, Florida, in my collection there are thirty-three cross-bands anterior to the tail, and the gastrosteges are yellow, with a narrow brown border at the base. These borders spread out at the end of every second or third scutum into a reddish-brown spot.

This snake has considerable resemblance in color to the moccasin, Ancistrodon piscivorus, Which inhabits the same localities, so that it is commonly mistaken for it by uncritical observers. Its more slender form should, however, distinguish it, even on the most casual obser-

In some specimens (Cat. No. 13779) the transverse bands are very distinct, as in young individuals; in Cat. Nos. 19798 and 11444, they are connected by the same color along the median vertebral line.
This subspecies is restricted to Florida. It approaches the V. compressicauda in the coloration of the belly.

General color dull brown, exhibiting narrow transverse bands of lighter, margined with dark brown or black; these bands generally about a half a scale in width and their margins more or less parallel immediately on the back. This is especially the case posteriorly, where they are usually at right angles to the axis of the body, anteriorly they are more or less oblique, and widen rapidly toward the abdominal scutelle. Sometimes the general brown line is so predominant as to render the transverse marks more or less obsolete, and the general tint then appears uniform above. The abdomen is always dull yellowish, each scutella with large blotches of light brown, margined with black.
In young individuals and in those generally in which the epidermis has been removed, the normal type of coloration is seen to consist of three series of nearly quadrate dark brown spots, with still darker bor-

der, one dorsal and one on each side. These are so disposed that the two corresponding lateral spots are opposite the interval between the two dorsal, and thus appear to be connected by alight line. The longitudinal diameter of the dorsal spots, amounting to three or four scales, is the greater; just the reverse of what is the case with the lateral. Of these lateral spots there are generally about thirty, two on each side from the head to the anus, the spaces between to or less than the spots, not greater, as in 7. fasciata. While the pattern is generally quite distinguishable on the posterior half of the body, anteriorly it becomes confused, the lateral blotches standing opposite to the dorsal and becoming confluent, so that the back appears crossed by lozenge-shaped blotches extending to the abdominal scutelle, and this separated on the sides by triangular intervals of a lighter color.
Occasionally the color appears to be a dull and rather light brown,

Scutellation as in the species generally; scales in twenty-three rows, the inferior more weakly keeled and of larger size than the others. Internasals longer than wide; oculars 1-3; middle of orbit above suture between fourth and fifth superior labials.
The color characters are quite peculiar. On the anterior part of the body brown bands cross the ground color reaching to the gastrosteges, the lateral parts having parallel sides, and being separated by spaces wider than themselves. The dorsal parts of these cross-bands gradually disappear and posterior to the middle or last third of the length are wanting, so that the coloration consists of lateral erect parallelogrammic spots separated by spaces of a yellow or gray ground color, equal to or a little wider than themselves. Belly yellow, with brown, rounded spots on the anterior parts of the gastrosteges; spots few on the anterior third in the type. Head brown without markings; labials lighter.

The head is broad behind and tapers forward, very much flattened above. The labials are eight above and eleven below; the fifth, sixth, and seventh the largest on both jaws.
Ground color dusky, with a dorsal series of subquadrangular brown blotches, alternating with the lateral series as far as the head; with anterior and posterior margins nearly parallel, rarely tapering downward and reaching the abdominal scutelle. The fuscous space between the lateral blotches is wider than that occupied by the blotches themselves. Along the tail both the dorsal and lateral blotches are small and subcireular. Underneath the color is yellowish, and the scutelle in the young margined posteriorly with black, while in the adult the middle region of the scutellz is unicolor, The head is brownish-black,

with a double yellow spot near the commissure of the occipital plates, and two spots of the same color on the commissural line between the vertical and supercilliaries. A black vitta extends from the posterior rim of the eye to the angle of the mouth.
This form has normally two more rows of scales than the subspecies fasciatus and sipedon. The alternation of the dorsal and lateral spots is more universal than in either of them, while the unspotted abdomen relates it to the subspecies N./. erythrogaster of the same geographical region.

Head elongated, narrowing forward. Gastrosteges most numerous of all the subspecies of the Natrix sipedon. Three postorbitals. An elevated loreal. Dorsal rows of scales, twenty-three, sometimes twentyfive, in number, all very strongly carinated. Uniform dark bluish black above, lighter on the sides; a lateral or external band of dull blue extending on the abdominal scutelle. Body beneath (in alcohol) uniform dull yellow, tail bluish.
The head is proportionally narrow and elongated, flattened above and convex on the snout. The frontal plate is elongated and subpentagonal, broader anteriorly than posteriorly, with the sides slightly concave. The postorbital plates, proportionally small, are three in number. Loreal large and polygonal, higher than long. There are three or four temporal shields very much developed, but one in contact with postorbitals. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-three or twenty-four in number, strongly carinated with the keels on the posterior third of the body, constituting very conspicuous and continuous ridges, the intermediate depressions or furrows giving to the body and tail a canaliculated appearance. The lateral or outer row, however, is but slightly carinated. The tail itself is subconical, very much tapering, forming one-fourth of the entire length.

A singular form of this subspecies was taken by Dr. H. C. Yarrow in Virginia (Cat. No. 13572). It is steel gray above, and dirty white below, the belly with gray punctulations increasing in density posteriorly. Traces of dark gray spots on the ends of the gastrosteges, most distinct on the posterior third of the length. No head markings. Another peculiar specimen is Cat. No. 10732, from Florida, in which district the subspecies seems to be rare. The median dorsal line is crossed by pairs of dark brown cross-bands, the spaces they inclose representing the spaces between the spots of the NV. s. sipedon. They

Seales in twenty-five longitudinal rows, all keeled. Form moderately robust. Internasals nearly triangular; prefrontals wider than long; frontal with parallel sides, which are longer than the anterior border.

<<<Page: 1002>>>

Rostral broad, low, divided in two by a vertical suture. Loreal higher than long. Oculars 2-3, the superior anterior shorter than the inferior; the inferior posterior so produced forward as to exclude the fifth superior labial from the orbit. Superior labials nine, the fourth only entering the orbit. Temporals 1-3, the superior of the second series elongate. The color is olive-brown above, dirty white below. There is a row of blackish spots along the sides, of small size, which cover the adjacent parts of three scales of the first and second rows, and which are separated by an interspace of one and a half scales. These spots are wanting from the anterior fourth of the length. Above the interval between them there is, on each side, a longitudinal dusky spot, which is entirely separate from that of the opposite side, and which is separated from the adjacent ones by a space of a lighter brown than the ground color. These longitudinal spots begin at the head and disappear near the middle of the length, after acquiring a tendency to extend obliquely downward and backward. Head without marks, except three pale spots on the parietals; one on each side of the median suture, and one at the angle of the frontal. Belly unicolor, except at the lateral spots, which extend over the posterior angle of the gastrosteges. Inferior surface of tail black-speckled. Cat. No. 14643; gastrosteges, 143--1; urosteges, 67; length, 271 mm.; tail, 66 mm. A single specimen of this species was found in the grounds adjacent to the central station of the United States Fish Commission in the heart of the city of Washington, and no second one has been obtained. It is a singular circumstance that this species should have remained so long unknown. By its scutellation and color pattern it is absolutely distinct from any other species of the genus, either of America or any other country. It is probably one of the rare species like the N. rigida and the Hyla andersonii, which are only seen at long intervals.

bifer, and does not taper from the anus, but narrows abruptly at onethird its length from the base. Dorsal rows twenty-one, all distinctly carinate. The scales are rather broad and much rounded posteriorly, those of the first dorsal row disproportionately small. The head is elongate and rather narrow posteriorly, but very deep and but little depressed on the snout. All the plates of the crown are large; the frontal very broad and short, the loreal longer than high, the upper and lower postorbitals small, but the central elongated so as to reach the Jabial plates.
The ground color is light olive brown, crossed on the anterior half of the body by wavings or somewhat zigzag transverse black bands, covering two or three scales longitudinally, and separated by intervals of one or two scales. These bands do not taper regularly on the sides, as in T. sipedon, but are constricted upon the sixth row on each side, but are wide upon the third, as upon the vertebral row. Posteriorly these bands become narrower, and finally break up into a dorsal series of vertically elongated spots, and a lateral series of small circular ones, which do not alternate with the dorsal series, as in N. f. sipedon, taxispilota, and others. or two inches behind the head the transverse bands are replaced by four distinct longitudinal black lines, the lateral ones covering the third, fourth, and part of the second rows, the upper ones covering the seventh, eighth, ninth, and part of the tenth rows; these black lines are separated by a little over one scale of ground color. None of the black markings involve the first dorsal row, which is yellowish olive, excepting some irregular dark mottlings. The head is yellowish olive, with the middle of the parietals and frontal and a patch extending from the eye back above the labials black. The rostral is yellow, distinctly margined above with black. All the labials above and below, and the inframaxillary plates are yellow, prominently margined with black. The abdomen is yellow, with two lines of black blotches.

Some specimens from Georgiana, Florida, present the following characters: They represent the supposed form bivitatus, but are only young of the typical form. Head oval, distinct from neck; tail long, moderately compressed at base; less than in types. Rostral plate elevated; internasals longer than wide; frontal elongate and with parallel sides. Loreal oblique, longer than high; oculars, 1-3, the inferior posterior not below the orbit, but nearly cutting the fifth superior labial out of its border. Temporals, 1-3; superior labials, eight; middle of orbit above suture between fourth and fifth. Inferior labials, ten; postgeneials larger than pregeneials. Scales of body in twenty-one series, all keeled.
Ground color above, light brownish ash; below, light yellow. The

<<<Page: 1005>>>

former region is crossed in the typical specimen by thirty-six blackishbrown crossbars, which are wide and close together on the median dorsal region, and tapering, and therefore separated on the sides. The dorsal parts of the spots unite and form two wide longitudinal bands on the anterior fifth of the length. A pale brown band passes from the superciliary plate to the side of the neck, leaving a dark postorbital band below. All the plates of the lips and throat are yellow, and have narrow black borders. On the yellow of the belly there are black spots on the gastrosteges which incline to fuse transversely, leaving a part of the ground visible in the middle. Anteriorly this arrangement assumes the form of two longitudinal black bands, which are well defined on the anterior fourth of the length, leaving a yellow band between and one on the outer side of them.

In this form the striping which appears on the neck of the form compressicauda is extended the entire length. It bears thus a partial resemblance to the Natrix clarkii, which is not far removed in affinity from the NV. compressicauda. The form described as NV. fasciata pictiventris connects NV. compressicauda with the N. fasciata.

The scuta of this subspecies are quite as in the last; as in the form of the rostral, internasal, and frontal plates and the relation of the orbit to the superior labials. Its chief peculiarities are in its twenty-three rows of dorsal scales, and in its coloration. In the latter it approaches the

These bars become wide on the part of the body near the head, and are split by the ground color without forming bands, except two short ones which form a V on the parietal plates. No postorbital band. Labials dusky, yellow bordered in front; geneials the same, with a large median yellow spot on each.

Natrix compressicauda obscura La:NNBERG, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., XVII, 1894, p. 330. I have not seen this form. It is thus described by Dr. Leennberg: Seales in twenty-one rows. The color of the back is dark bluish gray, ‘soot color.” On this ground the three series of spots can scarcely be distinguished, except on the anterior part of the body where they form transverse bands; the head is too dark to show any postocular bands; upper and lower Jabials, as well as mentals, with yellowish spots; the ground color of the belly is gray, a little reddish. On cach side on the dorsal margin of the gastrosteges there is a small light spot; a median black band extends from the first gastrosteges to the tip of the tail. On the anterior part there is a yellowish spot on each gastrostege in this black band, and the thirty anterior spots cover this band nearly completely, but farther back they become smaller and less distinct, disappearing on the tail.

One rather narrow preocular; postoculars three, the lowest very small. Vertical and superciliaries elongate; lateral border of the former scarcely converging; the latter narrow. Superior labials eight; fourth and fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials nine. Tail slender, slightly compressed at the base, three-tenths of the total length. Gastrosteges, 126; adivided anal; urosteges, 67.
Measurements.—Total length, 400 mm.; tail, 86 mm.
Above, blackish brown, darkest anteriorly. Very indistinct pale transverse bands are apparent. They are irregularly oblique and separated by intervals of two or three scales wide. Superior and inferior labials more or less completely margined anteriorly with yellow; geneial and gular plates spotted irregularly with the same. General color beneath a peculiar stone brown. A darker shade occupies the center of the gastrosteges as far as the vent. This is almost excluded anteriorly by a central series of transversely elliptical yellow spots, one near the anterior border of each gastrostege. These become narrower and broken, and upon the postezior two-thirds of the belly are almost lost. There is a very indistinct row of smaller spots upon each side of it anteriorly.
This species should be compared with N. f. sipedon and N. valida. It differs from the first in the numbers of rows of scales, and from all three in the form of the muzzle and coloration of the lower surface.

The only known specimen of this subspecies was found at Key West, Florida, and is preserved in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The color above is entirely uniform light brownish ash (clay color beneath epidermis), with about every alternate scale on the fourth and fifth rows marked with black on each side near its base. Posteriorly the scales of the first row are faintly marked with black at their bases. These black markings are not prominent and only perceptible upon close examination. The head, including the upper labials and rostral, has more of an olivaceous cast. The abdomen is entirely uniform pale grayish yellow, the tips of the scutelle being, however, tinged with the ashy brown color of the back.

Frontals small, the anterior almost triangular. Nasals and loreal rather large, the posterior border of the latter very oblique. Preocular one, postoculars three, superior labials eight, eye resting on the fourth and fifth, sixth and seventh largest and bounded above by the first temporal. Remaining temporals four on each side. Inferior labials ten, sixth longest. Posterior geneials longer than the anterior. General form rather slender, tail one-fifth the total length. Gastrosteges, 145; one divided anal; urosteges, 71.
The general color is leaden black above and below, with the following paler markings: A band of leaden gray begins upon the neck, occupying the second, third, and part of the first rows of scales. This extends to the anus, becoming darker and leaving the first row of scales poste

riorly. Upon the anterior third of the body irregular narrow vertical bands extend from this, separated by black spaces of one and a half or two scales in width, which spaces are sometimes inclosed by the confluence of the bands on each side of the black vertebral line.
This subspecies may be distinguished from those called Eutenia by Baird and Girard by its divided postabdominal scutelle. It, however, bears quite a close resemblance to some of them, for example, HE. pickeringi.

Yellowish brown, with four longitudinal bands of deeper brown. Abdomen dull yellow, with two clouded brown bands dotted with black. One anteorbital. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-one, all carinated,

<<<Page: 1012>>>

Head elongated, conical from occiput to the extremity of the snout, depressed above, subconcave on the occipital region, slightly sloping on the snout. Cephalic plates very much developed. Frontal subpentagonal, broader anteriorly, though slightly tapering. Internasals quite large. Three, or sometimes only two, postorbitals, variable in comparative size; when there are three the lowermost is suborbital. One anteorbital, large. Loreal well developed, longer than high. Upper labials eight, fifth and sixth largest, the latter very large. Scales of the body elliptical, rounded posteriorly in twenty-one rows. Outer row somewhat larger than the rest and very slightly carinated.
Color of head dirty brown, occipital and temporal region blackish. Each of the four longitudinal bands of deep brown covers two rows of scales. The intermediate yellowish brown spaces embrace each two rows of scales also, except the dorsal one, which has three rows. Hach of the abdominal clouded bands embraces one-fourth of abdominal space, inside of which is left a yellow space one-fourth of the width and exteriorly another yellow space one-eighth of the width of abdominal space. The tail beneath is blackish, owing to the confluence of the abdominal bands, interspersed with yellowish macule.
This is the western representative of the Floridian NV. compressicauda, and, like it, the basal part of the tail is compressed, but not to so high a degree. Its head is more acuminate than in either that species or the N. valida. The coloration of the belly is a good deal like that of the N. compressicauda, but the dorsal striation is totally distinct. However, a beginning of this character also may be seen on the anterior part of the Floridian species, for the dorsal spots are split, and their halves unite into two longitudinal bands.

Greenish brown above; two deep brown vittwe along the dorsal region. Contiguous edges of the outer row of scales and abdominal scutell finely margined with brown. The middle region of the outer row like the abdomen, as is that of the second row, but less distinctly. Abdomen reddish yellow, with two series of black spots on the middle region, approaching each other toward the anterior region of the body. Dorsal rows of scales nineteen, carinated except the outer row, which is smooth.
Head proportionately larger than in FR. leberis, much less depressed and shorter on the snout. Its upper surface is flat, the snout convex, the high and large rostral making it less sloping. Front piate subhexagonal and elongated. Parietals truncated _ posteriorly. Superciliaries narrow and_ tapering forward. Anterior pair of a frontals very small. Two postee

much larger than the lower. Loreal subcireular or oblong. An elongated and narrow temporal shield, followed by two or three smaller, Upper labials seven, fifth and sixth very large. Lower labials eleven, sixth and seventh largest. Scales elliptical, narrower along the middie line of the back, carinated, except the outer row, which is perfectly smooth, and furthermore distinguished by the scales having their height greater than their length. The second row is noticeable for its size, and sometimes for its want of carination, which in all cases is obsolete.
The ground-color is uniform greenish brown, but each seale on the flanks is marked with a small blotch of deeper brown at its base. The brown vitte of the back cover each one entire row and the half of the two adjoining rows, separated on the dorsal line by one row and two half-scales of the ground-color, Beneath dull yellowish. Along the middle region of the abdomen there are two series of elongated deep brown blotches approaching each other toward the anterior region and under the tail, sometimes, however, not extending beyond the anus.
This species approaches near to the V. grahamii, but differs in the

only adult specimen at my disposal in the very short muzzle, and long parietal shields, and absence of the lateral yellow band, with the presence of a median dark dorsal band. From JN, leberis it may be readily distinguished as to squamation, by the absence of keel on the first row of scales, and the rather wider lateral scales. In a small specimen from Palatka, Florida, the large loreal reaches the orbit by an angle between the two preoculars.

Chestnut brown, with a lateral yellow band, and three narrow, black dorsal vitte. Abdomen yellowish, with four brown bands, two of which are lateral and two medial. Dorsal rows of scales 19, all carinated.
Head small, little distinet from body, depressed, flattened on the region behind the orbit, sloping anteriorly. Rostral plate low, nearly twice as wide as deep. Internasals wider than long. Frontal parietals elongate equal distance from their front angle to rostral. There are two anteorbitals, the upper one the larger; and two postorbitals, the upper one the smaller. The loreal is large and higher than long. One temporal shield only in the first row; two or three large ones in the second. Upper labials seven, third and fourth entering orbit, fifth and sixth largest. Lower labials ten, fifth and sixth largest. Scales regularly elliptical, slightly notched posteriorly, and all of them earinated, gradually diminishing in width from the sides toward the middle line of the back. Those of the outer row one-third broader than the rest, and posteriorly subtruneated.
Ground color dark chestnut or chocolate brown above, marked with three narrow, black vittw or bands, one covering the medial row of dorsal scales, and two (one on each side) following the fifth row. A lateral yellow band occupies the upper half of the outer row and the

whole of the second row, thus broader than the black bands above. Immediately below, and contiguous to it, a somewhat larger brown band covers the lower half of the outer row of scales and the extremity of the abdominal scutelle. The abdomen is yellowish, provided along its middle region with two approximate brown bands, similar, though a little narrower, and interrupted by the yellowish edge of the scutelle. The tail beneath is almost rendered uniformly brown by the confluence of the bands.
This species inhabits a wide range of territory, and displays very little variation in any respect. It is entirely aquatic in its habits,

calls to mind that of the Carphophiops amenus of Say. It is, however, much larger, and the scales are very strongly carinated. The carinz are found on all the longitudinal rows of scales, of which there are nineteen exclusive of the belly scales. The external row is almost as sharply keeled as those on the back, even to the tip of the tail. The dorsal scales are narrow and elongated; the sides nearly parallel except near the ends. As already stated, the head is very small, the vertical plate is subhexagonal, the two anterior sides forming a very obtuse angle; the external edges are very convergent posteriorly. The nostrils in the middle of the two plates. There are one anteorbital and two postorbitals; there are six labials above and seven below, in addition to the rostrals. The ground color of this snake is a light purplish brown, with four rows of large, nearly circular, blotches covering the whole back and sides. They are arranged so as to alternate; the outer blotches on the outer row are a little larger than
A those on the two central i AN ones, and are of the width Wee of four or five scales. The Se belly is of a pale brick
red, fading to brownish F yellow in alcohol, with a well-defined blotch of black near the exterior

the abdomen, and there is also an obscure series ; of dark blotches on the anterior edge of the scales in the exterior dorsal row. The dots in this series are separated by intervals of two unmarked scales. The spots of this row alternate with those of the larger series immediately above. On separating the scales the skin is seen to be colored like the adjacent scales. It is black in the dark blotches and very light in the intermediate space, giving rise to the appearance of a whitish edge to the scales. There are thus four series of large spots on the back and sides, two on the belly, and two on the exterior dorsal rows, making eight in all. The last-mentioned row is sometimes very obscure, the others are always distinct. Kennicott referred this serpent to the genus Tropidonotus (Natrix), although it is different from the known species. It is somewhat like the N. rigida, but is differently marked, the latter having the two abdominal rows of spots close together on the middle of the belly instead of being separated. Neither is there any indication in NV. rigida of the four series of dorsal blotches. In fact there is no North American species more strongly marked than this.

Abdominal scuta, 123, the last one divided; subcaudal, 59. Dorsal rows of seales, 19.
Measurements.—Length, 488 mm., of which the tail measures 112 mm. As yet this species has only been detected in the northern central part of the eastern region, where it is not uncommon, The specimens obtained have been found in the woods, generally under logs. Its habits are thus not like those of a Natrix. It is rather sluggish and not very pugnacious.
In its distribution this species is one of the group which is restricted to a few of the northern States of the Mississippi Valley. These are Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.

Professor Hay remarks: !
This species is common about Indianapolis, almost as common as Lutainia sirtalis. It is found in Monroe County (D.S. Jordan); Crawfordsville (Beachler) ; Winchester (Engle and Wright); rare about Terre Haute, common in Putnam County (Blatchley).
This is a handsome species of snake, and one that is wholly innocent; nevertheless it exercises the right of the innocent, and when attacked makes a show of selfdefense. It has a habit of flattening itself excessively, so that it becomes very broad and thin. It will strike vigorously, but does no harm. It appears early in the spring, and is seen late in the autumn. Ina mild winter and on a sunny day, I have seen it on January 25. On the other hand, I have seen it as late as the middle. of October; indeed, it appears to be more abundant late in the autumn than in the summer. About this date, several half-grown ones were found. On the 21st of March one was dug up out of the mud on the margin of a pond. A specimen from Winchester, Indiana, contained eight eggs. These had apparently not begun development, and were only about 0.44 inch long. The species probably produces living young.

oculars; of the latter, the inferior is the smaller. Postoculars three; in contact with one broad temporal, which separates two labials from the occipital. Superior labials seven, or six from confluence of two, sometimes of the third and fourth, which bound the orbit. Inferior labials seven, fourth largest; postgeneial equal pregeneial, separated by scales. Frontal shield longer than broad, outlines straight, posterior angle less than right; occipitals nearly as long as from their border to rostrals, emarginate behind. Gastrosteges 120-135; anal 1-1; urosteges 37-51. Color olive-brown (one specimen light brown), with dense, minute punctuations above and below, and about fifty-four lightedged black crossbars extending over six rows of scales, alternating with shorter ones on the sides; both are broken into spots on the neck, where there is a large postoccipital blotch on each side.
Measurements.—Total length, 230 mm.; length of tail, 66mm.; length to rictus oris, 10 mm.
This species has a strong resemblance to the species of Storeria, and is placed in that genus by Boulenger, on account of the equality in the length of the teeth. It is found in the southern part of the plateau, and, according to Boulenger, in the highlands of Jalisco.

Seminatrix Copk, American Naturalist, 1895, p. 678.
Hemipenis undivided and with simple sulcus spermaticus; no papille. Tnternasals and prefrontals separate. Anal divided. Scales smooth, without pits.
This genus includes true Natricine with simple penis, divided anal plate, and smooth pitless scales. In one or the other of these characters it differs from all the genera of Natricinee. It will be necessary to discover whether some of the smooth-scaled snakes of other countries referred by Boulenger to Tropidonotus, do not belong to Seminatria.
But one species is known from the Medicolumbian fauna, which is thus characterized :

arched. ‘The center of the orbit anterior to the middle of the lip margin. The rostral is visible from above; the nasals approach so as to reduce the internasals to a subtriangular form each, of which the middle and posterior sutures are equal. The frontal is long and with parallel sides, its length exceeding that of the head in front of it. The parietals are still longer and wide, with subtruncate outline behind. Loreal plate higher than long, half the length of the single preocular, which does not reach the frontal. Postoculars two; temporals 1-2, the first in contact with three labials. Superior labials eight, their height subequal, the fourth and fifth bounding the orbit. Inferior labials nine, six in contact with geneials, five with the first, two with the second geneial; latter subequal. Seales in seventeen series, those of first deeper than long. Those of sides at vent and of basal two-thirds of the tail roof-shaped or obtusely keeled. About one sixth of the length in front of and behind the vent compressed, the dorsal outline keel-formed. Gastrosteges, 120; urosteges, 54.
Coloration above black, with a very faint, pale line along the center of each scale of several lateral series. The lines are more distinct near the vent and on the tail, and heighten the effect of carinze produced by the angulation of the scales. Beneath pale in the alcoholic specimen; in life, belly with the tail red; each scutum with a short black crossbar at its ends on the anterior margin. These cease a short distance anterior to the vent.
This species was discovered by Edward Tatnall, of Wilmington, Delaware, at Volusia, Florida. Since then others have been found at various points in the peninsula, among others at Lake Tarr, whence specimens have been sent to the Philadelphia Zoological Garden.
Without examining the vertebre I originally referred this species to Contia, as its smooth seales did not suggest reference to the water snakes. Subsequently Dr. Boulenger, in the Catalogue of Snakes in the British Museum, placed it in Tropidonotus. To determine the question by the penial test I later examined the male organ and found that Dr. Boulenger’s estimate of its affinities was entirely correct. I, however, think its peculiaraties entitle. it to generic separation from Natriz.
Concerning this species Dr. Einar Losnnberg! says:
SEMINATRIX PYG2A COPE, by
Florida.
I have but rarely found this little snake out of water, and in such cases only under some log or board near the water’s edge. It is common around the borders of the small Jakes in Orange County, where I have seen and caught specimens in Lake Eola, Orlando, in and around some small lakes near Clarcona, Toronto, Apopka, and other places.

The number of supralabials is variable. In most cases there are eight, but I have two specimens with only seven, and one with only six on one side. In these cases of reduction the posterior ones have become fused, as is shown by their size and the frequent preserce of an incomplete section.
STORERIA Baird and Girard.
Storeria BAIRD and GIRARD, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt. 1, Serpents, 1853, p. 135. Ischnognathus DUM®RIL, Prodrome des Ophidiens, 1853, p. 72.—DUM&RIL and Brpron, Erp. Gén., VII, 1854, p. 506.
Head distinct from the body. Cephalic plates normal. Loreal plate absent. Orbitals posterior and anterior. Nasalstwo. Body subcylin' drical; tail comparatively short, tapering. Dorsal scales carinated. Anal seutum bifid. Subcaudals divided. Teeth small, numerous, of equal lengths, ungrooved.
This genus is a reduced type of Natrix, to which it is connected by the Mexican N. storerioides Cope. Its range is nearctic, extending south as far as the plateau of Vera Paz and Guatemala.
There are three species of the genus, which differ as follows:
Oculars 1-2; seven upper labials, the posterior wide; nostril between nasals; belly
erayish white; a black spot below orbit ...-.-.-------------------------S. dekayt. Oculars 1-2; six upper labials, the posterior narrow; nostril between nasals; no black spot below orbit; belly grayish white...--.--..--..-------.----S. tropica.! Oculars 2-2; five or six upper labials, the posterior narrow; nostril in anterior nasal; no dark spot below orbit; bellyred ..---.--.-----.----S. occipitomaculata.
S. tropica agrees with the S.dekayi Holbrook, excepting in two points. Ithas but six superior labials. The diminution in the number is posterior to the orbit, and the fifth and sixth scuta are of a different form from those of the S. dekayi. They are longer and less elevated. The second character is in the color. This species lacks the dark mark that descends from the orbit to the superior labial margin in the S. dekayi.

wide as high, obtusely rounded, visible from above. Internasals wider than long. Frontal with lateral and anterior borders straight and about equal, twice as wide as each superciliary. Parietals longer than wide, truncate posteriorly. Nostril partially in the prenasal. Temporals 1-2, the first extending to middle of last superior labial. Seven upper labials on each side. Lower labials seven, of which the fourth and fifth are very large, extending quite to the mental. A second plate parallel with the sixth, rather longer. Pregeneials longer than postgeneials; the latter bounded behind by the generally undivided first gastrostege, which is separated from the labials by one row of seales. Exterior row of seales largest, rest diminishing gradually to the back; all keeled, the first weakly.
Color grayish brown, sometimes chestnut-brown above and on the sides, with a dorsal stripe extending from occiput to the end of the tail, of a decidedly lighter tint, and about three and two half-scales in width. This is bordered along each outer edge by a series of rounded brown dots, occurring at intervals of about two scales; of these there are
Fig. 268. STORERIA DEKAYI HOLBROOK. xX 2. Racine, Wisconsin. Cat. No. 1858, U.S.N.M.
about seventy pairs from occiput to anus. Each dot occupies generally a_single scale, but is sometimes seen on the skin on each side. On separating the scales, the skin on each side of the fourth lateral row of scales exhibits a second series, similar to and alternating with the first. A third series, opposite to the first and alternating with the second, is seen along the second row, and there are even traces of a fourth between the abdominal and first dorsal series. Of these only the firstmentioned series is visible under ordinary circumstances, and is generally only to be made out on separating the scales, the color only oceasionally being shown on their margins. The first pair of dots just behind and across the angle of the jaw is enlarged into a crescentic patch, coneave before. A second narrow vertical patch of black across the sides of the head, anterior to a point halfway between the first and the eye; this sometimes interrupted in the middle. The posterior margins of the third and fourth (sometimes the second) labials black, showing two vertical lines below the orbit. Plates on top of head mottled chestnut-brown.

<<<Page: 1026>>>

Color beneath grayish white, with one or two black specks near the
exterior edge of each scale.

In some specimens the brown of the sides increases in depth to the
dorsal stripe.
In some, too, a transverse bar connects the lateral spots
across the back.
In a very young specimen from Grosse Ile, the colors are dark chestnut above, with the interval between the occipital patches and the cephalic plates and orbit white, crossed by a vertical black line on the angle of the mouth.
Measurements.—Length, 45 inches.
Anomalies in the scutellation of this species sometimes occur. The most frequent is the longitudinal division of the first abdominal seutum, which then forms a third pair of geneial plates. This character has been made the basis of the variety “‘ anomala” of Duges.! It occurs in Cat. Nos. 1860, 2215, 4918, 6474, U.S. National Museum. In Cat. No. 2275 there are two preoculars on each side. In Cat. No. 1860 there is a small superior postnasal on one side.
This species is distributed throughout the entire eastern and austroriparian regions of North America as far west as Kansas. Southward it extends into Mexico on the table-land, and to the State of Vera Cruz. The largest specimens come from about New Orleans.
Like its allies of the Natricine, the Storeria dekayi is viviparous. It is abundant and is gentle in disposition, making no attempt to bite. It is entirely terrestrial in its habits, and I have never known it to be
found near water. : Storeria dekayi Holbrook.

This species is not readily exterminated by the increase of population; its fecundity, obscure colors, and small size protecting it. A vacant lot on the outskirts of Philadelphia has been noted as a place for finding them, and the boys that know can generally procure specimens there when they are desired.

Coluber venustus HALLOWELL, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., III, 1847, p. 274; VI, 1849, p. 245.
Orbitals, two anterior, two posterior. Dorsal scales in 15 rows. Above gray, or chestnut-brown, sometimes with a paler vertebral line; beneath red or salmon-color. Three distinct light-colored spots behind the head and a smaller one on the fourth and fifth upper labial.
Nostril almost entirely in the prenasal plate, in some cases the postnasal not entering at all into it. Six upper labials, eye over third and fourth, all higher than long except the fifth ann sixth. The fifth is about twice as long as high, and the sixth is rather shorter. Temporals 1-2, the first pointed posteriorly and extending over more than half of the sixth superior labial. Lower labials 7, fourth and fifth of equal length, but fifth wider. Pregeneials longer than postgeneials, the latter bounded by first gastrostege, which is never divided. Vertical plate

hexagonal, shield-shaped. Muzzle rather broad, eyes larger than in ~ S. dekayi.
Color above light chestnut-brown, sometimes chestnut-gray, at others olivaceous; a paler vertebral line from occiput to end of tail, about three scales in width; on each side of this may be seen a series of minute brown spots, produced by the brown bases of the scales in the
_third row on each side from the central series. Sometimes the brown covers the whole scale, and gives rise to two dorsal lines; at others it is almost entirely wanting, and this, connected as it generally is with aless distinct vertebral band, gives the impression of a uniform tint above. Upper margin of the exterior dorsal lines brighter yellowish, giving the effect in some cases of a lateral narrow light line. Abdomen in life salmon-color, in aleohol whitish yellow, with the sides finely mottled with dark-brown, sometimes obsoletely, at others constituting very distinct bands. These generally do not encroach upon the dorsal scales. Occasionally, however, the middle of the exterior row of scales exhibits a dark stripe. Immediately behind the occipital plates, and on the median line, is seen a dull salmon-colored blotch, on each side

of which, over the angle of the jaws, is a similar smaller one. The intervals between these blotches sometimes darker. A small salmoncolored spot on the fourth or fifth upper labial, behind the orbit. Plates on the top of the head blotched with darker. Lower jaw minutely dotted with brown.
The following description of a living specimen caught at Westport, New York, August, 1847, is from Prof. S. F. Baird’s manuscripts:
Iris dark chestnut, rather lighter above and externally. General color above dull chestnut-brown. Attentively examined, however, when wet, there is seen a faint dorsal stripe of lighter color, bordered by a line on each side of darker, which fades off to the abdominal scutell until the color is the same as the dorsal line, or even lighter. Behind the head are three light yellowish brown occipital spots. Whole under parts, except the chin or throat, bright brick-red. Chin and throat white, mottled finely with gray and black, like pepper and salt. An irregularly defined stripe of the same mottling along the sides, from head to anus, crossing the abdominal scutellie near the outside. :
A strongly marked variety is seen in individuals from Charleston and Anderson, South Carolina, in which the body is dark slate-blue, except the middle third of the abdomen, which is yellowish white. The dorsal lines of black dots are visible through the ground-color; the lateral

<<<Page: 1029>>>

lighter line is scarcely perceptible. The three occipital spots, and that on the labials, are distinct.
Another variety is seen in a specimen from Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where, in addition to the coloration just mentioned, the vertebral stripe is light chestnut, contrasting strongly with the ground-color.
Another specimen which I found at Johnsonburg, Elk County, Pennsylvania, in a rugged region, is a very dark brown with the dorsal band obseure and the under surfaces black. The throat and chin are whitish, and the black is darkest in a row of spots on each side of a dozen anterior gastrosteges.

This small snake is generally distributed in the Eastern and Austroriparian regions, having about the same range as the S. dekayi. It extends south also to Vera Cruz, Mexico. It is less common in the United States than the S. dekayi, but I have found it more abundant in western Massachusetts. Like its congener, it is entirely inoffensive, and is found on the ground and in the woods in dry places.

Head subelliptical, distinct from the body. Cephalic plates normal. Two nasals; posterior one not invaded by the nostril. Postfrontals and loreal entering into the orbit, and suppressing the anteorbitals. Superciliaries well developed. Mental scutelle two pairs. Pupil circular. Scalessmooth. Postabdominal scutella bifid. Subcaudal scuta all divided.
The distinctness of the head from the neck, and the relatively narrow frontal plate in this genus, resemble conditions common in the Hatricine. The lateral head scuta are like those of Rhabdosoma and its immediate allies.

The specimens show considerable variation in the number of the postocular scuta. Thus in two specimens from Fort Towson, Arkansas (Cat. No. 2055), there are three on each side; in Cat. No. 12023, from Mount Carmel, Illinois, there are two on each side, and in Cat. No. 13632, from Helotes, Texas, the two are fused into a large one on each side.
The differences between this species and the V. valerie are restricted to the form and number of the scales. Beyond these I have not been able to detect any.

Amphiardis Corr, Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 391.—BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 290.
Head not distinct; teeth equal. Scales keeled; anal and subcaudal scuta divided. Cephalic scuta of upper surface normal. Rostral not prominent; two internasals. Two nasals, one loreal which extends to the orbit. No preocular. Pupil round.
This genus embraces, as yet, but a single species. It is most nearly allied to Haldea, from which it differs only in the presence of two internasal plates. The species is little known.

Moderately stout, slightly depressed; head small, not distinet from the neck, subconical; tail short,*tapering to a point. Snout short, blunt. Eye moderate. Nostrils anterior, directed horizontally in the anterior portion of the divided nasal. Nine head shields. Rostral very small, not reaching the top of the head. Two internasals (left smaller in each specimen). Loreal elongate, with the prefrontal forming the anterior border of the orbit. Prefrontals as broad as long. One postorbital. Temporals 1+1. Labials five, third and fourth in orbit, fifth largest. Infralabials six, fifth largest. Posterior submentals half as large as the anterior, Scales carinate, lustrous, in seventeen rows; dorsal narrow; outer broad and faintly keeled; ventrals 125-129. Anal divided. Subcaudals thirty-six pairs.
Uniform brownish olive on the dorsal rows. No band on the occiput. Ventrals whitish, tinged with olive on the bases. Largest specimen, total length 10,3; inches; tail 1,4, inches.
Two specimens of this species are known, both found near Dallas, in northern Texas. I have had the opportunity of examining them in the Museum of Comparative Zoology through the kindness of Dr. Agassiz and Mr. Garman.
HALDEA Baird and Girard.
Haldea BAIRD and GIRARD, Cat. N. Amer. Rept., Pt.1, Serpents, 1853, p. 122.— BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 290. Conocephalus BIBRON, Prodrome des Ophidiens, 1853, p. 46.
Head elongated, ellipsoid, distinct from the body. Internasal plate single, Prefrontals large, entering together with the loreal into the orbit, thus suppressing the anteorbitals. Postorbital one. Two nasals. Pupilcircular. Scales carinated. Postabdominal scutella bifid. Subcaudals divided.
This genus has the form and probably the habits of the Calamarina, but the continuity of the vertebral hypapophyses throughout the vertebral column and the characters of the hemipenis indicate that its aftinities are with the Natricinz, of which group it is probably a degenerate offshoot.

Loreal elongated, situated above the second and third labials, and forming, with the postfrontal, the anterior part of the orbit. Eyes circular. Superciliaries proportionally large. One angular postorbital,
elevated, the fourth labial forming the lower portion of the posterior part of the orbit.
Temporal shields of medium size. Mouth deeply cleft. Upper labials five; fourth and fifth very large. Inferior labials six; fifth disproportionally the largest.
_ Body slender, subcylindrical; tail short, and very much tapering. Scales lanceolated, in seyenteen rows, all carinated, very narrow along the back; outer row conspicuously broader, with an obsolete carination.
Grayish brown above, soiléd yellow beneath (said to be reddish gray above, and salmon-colored beneath, in life), a narrow light chestnut band across the middle of the occipitals, spreading over the angle of the mouth. ;
This small species is distributed over the Austroriparian district, and extends into the Eastern, but how farisas yetunknown. Fort Jackson, Minnesota, is the most northern locality in the following list, but for its accuracy I can not vouch. Richmond, Virginia, is the most northern locality in the East.

Head not distinct from body. Teeth equal. Seales keeled; anal plate entire; subeaudal scuta divided. Cephalic scuta normal; two internasals, rostral not prominent. One nasal and one _ loreal. Hemipenis with two apical papillie.
This genus shows its position to be in the Natricinz by the presence of the vertebral hypapophyses on the posterior part of the column. In its entire anal plate, and in its pattern of coloration, it resembles the genus Hntenia, and especially such species as /. brachystoma Cope and FH. leptocephala Baird and Girard, where the head is not very distinct. It is probably a terrestrial modification of that genus, as the Natriv kirtlandii is of Natrixz. But one species of the genus is known. The peculiar apical papille of the hemipenis I find to be entirely constant.

entire length of the scale; tail short and tapering toa point; abdominal scuta, 138; subcaudals, 34; a single preanal.
Brown above, with three narrow yellow dorsal vittse, the middle occupying one row and a half of the adjoining row of scales; head above brown; upper jaw light yellow; abdomen and under part of tail yellow, with a double row of triangular spots of a bluish-black color along the middle of the former and base of the latter; these spots are sometimes confluent at their bases; the spots beneath the epidermis are perfectly black.
This species is especially characteristic of the western part of the Mississippi Valley, occurring in the western part of the Eastern, and the Texan part of the Austroriparian subregions. It is not uncommon in northern Texas, the Indian Territory, and southern Kansas, extending north to Iowa and Ohio, inclusive.

Cephalic plates normal; two nasals, one loreal. Eye resting on superior labials. Scales keeled, without pores. Anal plate entire; subcaudals divided. The maxillary teeth are rather abruptly longer near the posterior extremity of the maxillary bone than elsewhere, as in the genus Natrix, with two exceptions. These are the species H. multimaeulata Cope and EH. melanogaster Wiegmann. I have on this account distinguished these species as constituting another genus which I called Atomarchus, the character distinguishing it from Hutenia being the equality in length of the maxillary teeth. As the excess in length of the posterior teeth is small in some of the species of the latter, I have not for the present retained this genus, although it may be found to be advisable to do so hereafter. The two species mentioned are more aquatic in their habits than the Eutzniz proper.
This genus was established by Baird and Girard in the Catalogue of Serpents of North America, published in 1853, on species which had been previously referred to the genus Natrix (Tropidonotus). To the three species previously known these authors added four; and nine names were proposed for what are in my estimation either subspecies or individuals of the seven species actually distinguished. In the year 1860 Kennicott added five species. At various dates between 1860 and 1885 the present writer added nine species, and referred to the genus a species long previously described by Wiegmann. In 1890 Brown added a species, and a species is described for the first time in the present review. The total number of species is, then, twenty-four.

<<<Page: 1039>>>

Eutienie are the most abundant snakes in North America and Mexico. Where all other species are absent, either through hostility of the climate or of enemies, individuals of this genus remain. ‘This persistence may be ascribed to several causes. One of these is their great fecundity. Professor Baird mentions a specimen of /. sirtalis which produced eighty young at a birth. Another cause is their readiness to seek concealment in water, so that they most readily escape observation.
Several of the species are pugnacious in their disposition. Such is the case with the two which have the widest distribution and greatest abundance of individuals, the /. sirtalis Linneus and LH. elegans Baird and Girard. Their bite, it is needless to remark, is perfectly harmless. Some of the species possess great elegance of form, as those of the H. saurita group. Others have much brillianecy of color, as the metallic green of some forms of the FE. proxima and the red and black of the LE. sirtalis concinna,
The genus Hutenia presents especial attractions to the student who desires an illustration of the phenomena of variation and constancy in the physical characters of animals. In few genera do we find so well illustrated the persistence of specific characters exhibited side by side with variations of the same. We have here, therefore, examples of the appearance or disappearance, as the case may be, of characters in connection with or without apparent connection with the environment.

The aftinities of these species may be expressed in the following diagram :
The £. sirtalis presents the greatest number of points of contact with other species. It also inhabits the region of geologically the greatest age, or that region which has been a frog land area for the longest time. Although large portions of the west of North America were elevated at the close of the Cretaceous period, and probably before the genus Hutenia was in existence, the ancestors of Hutenia may be safely believed to have inhabited the area which was land prior to the Cretaceous. so that the descent of Hutenia was new and possibly in the eastern rather than in the western half of the continent. It is thus rendered probable that Hutenia sirtalis is the ancestral form. This is also confirmed by the fact that it is a spotted species, since the unicolor species, as EL. saurita, have spotted young.

The above table gives but a very general view of the distribution of the species, since some of them are restricted to districts of the regions only, while a few species are known from so few examples that their range is unknown. Of the latter class are HL. butlerti, HE. brachystoma, EH. rutiloris, BE. augustirostris, and E. nigrilatus. The EH. sackenii is restricted to Florida, and the EH. radix to that part of the central region that lies east of the Rocky Mountains, entering the eastern region. The widely distributed species, as H. sirtalis and FE. elegans, are represented in special districts by peculiar subspecies, which look very different from each other. The H#. proxima has a range which does not coincide with any zoological district, inhabiting eastern Mexico, Texas, and the Mississippi Valley.
The study of the several hundred specimens of species of this genus which are contained in the U.S. National Museum and my private collection shows that in most of the species the number of rows of scales and the number of the labial plates are quite constant. In only one species, the LH. leptocephala, is the number of scale rows varied by the presence or absence of a single row on each side, and in none is the number of labial plates frequently variable. The position of the lateral stripe is, as stated by Baird and Girard, very constant. The relative length of the tail is constant within certain limits and in certain species.. In some of the species it varies a good deal. The coloration varies within limits in each species, and often characterizes subspecies with considerable precision, transitional forms in some such cases being rare and in others more frequent. The species of the Pacific coast present the greatest difficulties to the systematist. Here the eastern LH. sirtalis comes into contact with the western LH. elegans, and some close parallels in coloration occur. Thus the LH. s. parietalis resembles very much the FH. elegans ordinoides, and the £. s. sirtalis resembles considerably the /. e. lineolata. The H. infernalis intervenes between

<<<Page: 1043>>>

the LH. sirtalis and FE. elegans in scale formule. The L. leptocephala appears quite distinct from the southern west coast forms, but it has melanistic phases which resemble melanistic forms of the LH. sirtalis from the northwest coast in Washington, such as L. s. pickeringii.
The colors of the young afford some clew to the order of probable appearance of color marks in the adults. As already remarked by Baird and Girard, the spots are more distinct in the young than in adults, both as to isolation from each other and in distinctness of color. When spots disappear and are replaced by a uniform tint, both lighter (E. elegans vagrans) and darker (H. elegans lineolata and E. sirtalis obscura), the change first appears on the posterior part of the body. The tendency to form cross-bars or spots appears first on the anterior part of the body. This is slightly developed in the JL. sirtalis semifasciata but extends throughout the greater part of the length in the EF. phenax. In species in which the top of the head is pale, as LH. elegans vagrans, it is very dark or black in the young. This dark color is paler also in the H. e. couchii, and in the HL. e. marciana, but leaves its posterior portion as a pair of large black nuchal spots.

and sometimes these also disappear. In the type specimen the dorsal stripe is represented by a half-inch posterior to the head; no spots or markings on the gastrosteges.
In seven specimens the proportion of the tail to the total length is as follows: Cat. No. 10589, two and three-fourths, two and four-fifths; Cat. No. 10693, two and four-fifths; Cat. No. 11987, two and five-sixths, two and nine-tenths, two and nine-tenths; Cat. No. 12596, three.
This species is distributed over Florida generally, and ranges as far westward as Mobile, Alabama, from which point specimens were sent me by my friend, Dr. Joseph Corson, United States Army. It is the most slender species of the genus, and is characterized by the form of the first row of scales. These are narrow, differing very little from those of the other rows. Like them they are strongly keeled, and are notched at the apex. The form originally described has no dorsal stripe. Specimens of this kind were sent me from Volusia. Specimens from Georgiana, belonging to the U.S. National Museum, and from Mobile have a dorsal stripe with blackish borders. Two Volusia specimens have seven superior labials, while one has eight. Two specimens from Mobile have eight superior labials, and ten from other parts of Florida have the same. In one of the specimens from Georgiana the colors, including the stripes, are obscure.

.The superior labials are constantly seven in twenty-six specimens examined.

A series of small spots along the superior edge of the lateral stripe is seen in the only young specimen in the collection.
The seven superior labials and the color distinguish this species from the H. sackenti. The carination of the scales is also not so strong as in the latter.
The Lutenia saurita ranges the eastern and austroriparian districts, except Florida and Texas. Specimens in Yarrow’s Check-list said to be from the latter districts belong to the H. sackenii and HE. proxima, respectively. 1t is especially abundant in the Middle States, but is not known to extend north of Massachusetts. It is an elegant creature, and is generally found near water, in which it swims readily, being more aquatic in its habits than the H. sirtalis, which is found in the same localities.

In thirty-eight specimens the labials are constantly eight above; in one specimen (Cat, No. 13051) they are eight on one side and seven on the other, and in one (Cat. No. 13050) they are seven on both sides.
A young specimen of 300 mm. is unspotted.
The Eutenia proxima ranges throughout the Mississippi Valley to the mouth of the Mississippi River, throughout Texas from Dallas to

the mouth of the Rio Grande, and in eastern Mexico as far south as Orizaba. The individuals from the Mississippi Valley from New Orleans to Indiana: and Wisconsin are generally blacker above than Texan specimens, and they have been regarded as a distinct species under the name of /. faireyi. This is, however, only a melanistic phase of the HL. proxima. Specimens occur in my collection from Dallas, Texas, and another black one in the U.S. National Museum comes from so far west as Fort McKavett, which formerly stood on the Upper Llano River.
Besides the shorter foal this species is readily known from the two species just before described, by the increased difference in form between the scales of the first and those of the other rows. Their form is distinctly different from that of the latter, but the diversity is not so great
as in the H. radix and other species which follow. A remarkable variety of this species comes from Fort Stockton, A pale shade represents the dorsal stripe, and the generally

A few of the scales have narrow black spots on their edges, but these are not prominent, and never extend over a scale, appearing as indistinct mottlings of black on the ground color, always on the rows next the strips. The head above is light olive ash. The lateral strip is on the third and fourth rows, and is narrower than in 7. provima, covering rather less than two scales. The
‘color below the lateral stripe is a little lighter than that of the back. The exterior dorsal row is much wider than in any of the allied species, each scale being as high as long. The second row is much narrower, though a little wider than the third. The eye is strikingly large and

the pinerciligtios are raised, rendering the fore part of the crown an inclined plane, yet the tenis is higher than in L. prowima. ; The Hutenia megalops connects the species of the H. saurita group — with the ordinary types of the genus with the larger number of lateral — plates and dorsal scales. It is confined to our southwestern border and — to the northern part of Mexico. It is evidently the most abundant — snake in Chihuahua. The large number of specimens sent from near the city of that name display very little variation, and agree with one — from New Mexico, described by me as above. ‘The lateral band gener: ally occupies only the third row of scales, but sometimes borders the — fourth. The dorsal band very frequently occupies but one row of scales, but occasionally covers the halves of the adjacent rows. Cat.

of scales on each side, and the median row with the adjacent halves of the adjacent rows. The brown space between the stripes is marked by two alternating rows of square blackish spots, and a single similar row marks the brown ground below the lateral stripe. Belly greenish white; each gastrostege with a black spot near the lateral extremity, extending various distances from the base. The superior labial plates are bordered posteriorly with black, sometimes narrowly, sometimes broadly. The color of the sides is continued onto the head, without the isolation of the anterior portion as a black spot on each side of the nape. Sometimes the superior labials are bordered with black posterior to the postoculars, sometimes not.
In twenty-nine specimens I have found three with eight superior labials on one side, and two with eight on both sides. In eighteen specimens I have found one with nineteen rows of

scales, and this one is the type Fig. 279. of Baird and Girard’s original EUT2NIA RADIX BAIRD AND GIRARD. . ; ile SC * us pripulon : 2 Mouse River, Montana. This is a species of the central Cat. No. 9588, U.S.N.M.
plains, not passing the Rocky Mountains to the west. It extends south as far as Dallas, Texas, and north into Canada, and east to Lake Michigan and Ohio, exclusive.
There are three color forms of this species which do not differ sufficiently to deserve distinction as subspecies. The species from northern localities, including the type, are dark colored, the ground color obseuring the spots, which can be, nevertheless, always discerned. Southern individuals are much lighter colored, the ground being a light olive, so that the spots both above and below the lateral stripe are very distinct, and the lateral stripe is little contrasted. The third form, represented by two specimens from Indiana, is also brightly colored, and the spots on theends of the gastrosteges are prolonged posteriorly so as to form a black stripe on each side of the abdomen; but this is interrupted, the stripe being only continuous in sections, including from two to five scuta.
The first of these color forms includes the type specimen, which has, however, the stripes a little narrower than usual, and has the peculiarity of having only nineteen rows of scales. To the average typical form the name F. radix tiviningii Coues and Yarrow, has been given. The second form is the Hutenia haydenii Kennicott. The other is the FE. r. melanoteenia Cope.

Dr. Henry Brous thus writes of the habits of the Hutenia radia:'
Several of the summers I passed upon the plains were preceded by rainy springs, swelling to unusual height the small streams, which became inhabited by small fishes. During the drought of hot summers the receding waters left the fishes in shallow
pools within creek beds, an easy prey to their numerous enemies.
The midday heat caused numbers of snakes to seek shelter from the sun, and the garter snake Zutenia radix) in particular chose water at this time. unable to escape or to find deep water, were unwilling cotenants with the snakes. The latter are fond of fish, and would devour great numbers of the smaller ones, chasing them from one part of the shallow pool to another. , in water too shallow to swim in, or were struggling upon the sand, they would be seized by the snakes, who would feed upon them until unable to contain more. The snakes would follow the fish through the water, diving and remaining submerged
some time. I did not observe “her swallow air ee Am. Nat., Jan., 1880).

evince more than ordinary energy and sagacity in capturing fish; half a dozen will congregate within a small pool, all acting in concert.
Mr. J. L. Wortman, who-had charge of a scientific party last year, informs me that while fishing one day he canght numbers of chub (Cyprinida) and, throwing them on the sand, was surprised to see that but few remained. While quietly continuing to replace those so singularly missing, he observed a garter snake seize and swallow one of the fish 6 inches in length. There were two of these snakes reaping the reward of Mr. Wortman’s skill. Upon opening the snakes one was found to contain six fishes.

This species has been found in Arizona, whence two specimens were sent to the Zoological Garden at Philadelphia. They are of plain brownish colors, and resemble at first sight the LW. sirtalis sirtalis. Previous to this discovery of its range, the subspecies was chiefly

known from the valley of Mexico. I took three specimens at the lake of Xochimilco and at Chapultepec, and Dr. Dugés sent me a fourth from Guanajuato. Mr. Bocourt sent a fitth from some part of Mexico to the National Museum. These all differ from the type of #. macrostemma, which is also from the valley of Mexico, in the general indistinctness
of their markings and in the absence of the parietal spots. On loss —
of the epidermis the markings come out, except the parietal spots. This is a water snake in its habits, but spends much of its time on the banks. My friend, Mr. Julius Flohr, of the City of Mexico, took
me ou a boating excursion on the lake of Xochimilco, near that city,
and I had the opportunity of observing the habits of this snake and of comparing them with those of the HE. melanogaster, which inhabits the same locality.

venerable structure. On examining this vegetation at my height above |
the ground, I encountered in the thick of it around eye. Exposure revealed first the head and then the body of a snake of this species, which found a congenial abode in that position.
This is the species which appears on the arms of Mexico. Tradition states that Cortes adopted the arms after observing an eagle (Polyborus) sieze a water snake and carry it to a large cactus (Opuntia) in its talons.!
I have seen this brightly colored form from Guanajuato (Dugés); Mexico (Hoeje), and Vera Cruz (Sartorius and the Geographical Commission).

Butenia butlerii Cope, Proc. U. 8S. Nat. Mus., XI, 1888, p. 399. Tropidonotus ordinaius var. butlerii BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, p. 212.
Scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, the inferior much the widest and keeled. Superior labials seven, inferior labials eight. Temporals, 1-1; the second large, extending from parietal to labials. Oculars, 1-3. Parietals with the external border abruptly contracted. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-four; anal, one; urosteges, sixty-two. Head very little distinct, muzzle conical, a little protuberant; eye not large. Ground color above, olive brown, which is marked by the usual three longitudinal yellowish bands. The median covers one and two half rows of scales, and the lateral covers the second, third, and fourth rows. Both are black bordered on bothedges, the border of the latter band interrupted. The p-ements of the he Cedar Creek, Waterloo, Indiana. rior border of the lateral tan GLa band represent the inferior spots of the lateral series; the superior row is wanting from the scales. Gastrosteges and urosteges olive, yellowish in front, dark behind, with a vertical black spot at the anterior border of each end of each of the gastrosteges. Labial scuta without black borders; head olive above, without markings, except two small, yellow, black-edged parietal spots in the usual position.
I have seen but two specimens of this species, one of which belongs to the collection of Purdue University, at Lafayette, Indiana (Cat. No. 264), and which is labeled as from Richmond, Indiana, It is remarkably distinct from everything which occurs in the United States, and has only superficial resemblances to the HL. macrostemma Kennicott of Mexico. Its peculiar characters are the great width of the lateral color band, which covers three rows of scales, one more than in any other species; the black borders of the bands; the absence of well-defined dorsal lateral spots, and the absence of markings on the head and labial scuta. Besides these color marks, the presence of a large second temporal plate extending to the labials is peculiar to this species, and the small number of inferior labials distinguishes it from the L. sirtalis group; and the narrow conical head is characteristic. In the &. macrostemma the general appearance is somewhat similar, but the labial plates are broadly black edged, and the lateral band covers but two rows of seales; there is a large postoral yellow dark-edged crescent, and the second temporal plate is smaller and does not reach the labials,

A second specimen, received from northern Indiana, shows that the spei cies ranges over the entire State. It only differs from the type in : rather darker colors. 7 This handsome species is dedicated to Mr. A. W. Butler, of Brookville, Indiana, who lent me the type specimen for examination, and whose interest and labor in the natural sciences have resulted in many inter— esting discoveries. |

Mr. G. Reddick reports’ that the Indiana University summer school took a single specimen of this species at Turkey Lake, Kosciusko County, Indiana. He says:
It is 14} inches long. It is short and chubby, and its movement is very characteristic of it. It does not have the gliding movement of /. saurita, nor the swilt and active movement of the Natrix sipedon, but seems rather to exert a lai ge amount of force to do little crawling. The movement is so characteristic that I believe any one having once seen the peculiar way in which it tries to hurry itself away would ever after be able to recognize it at a distance.
EUTAENIA BISCUTATA Cope.
Eutenia biscutata Corn, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1883, p. 21.
Of this species I have only two specimens, which agree in the following characters: They differ in the number of rows of scales, however, one having twenty-three and the other having twenty-two. All the rows of scales keeled, the median ones very strongly. Labials eight, the eye resting on the fourth and fifth. Two preoculars; three postoculars. The muzzle is rather short, the frontal plate exceeding in length the region anterior to it and equaling the common suture of the parietal secuta. Nasals rather short; loreal as long as high; inferior preocular nearly square; superior preocular not reaching frontal. Superior labials all truncate above and none of them elevated, the sixth touching the inferior postorbital. 'Temporals, 1-2-3; the anterior are rather large. Pairs of geneials subequal.

1The Eutenia rutiloris (Cope, Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc., 1885, p. 388) which is compared with the Z. butlerii in the analytical table of species, is from Cozumel Island, Yucatan.
It resembles in coloration and in the keeled first row of scales the Z. sackeni of Florida. It differs in the shorter tail, which is one-third the length in the Z. sackent, in the eight superior labials, and in the generally stouter proportions, as well as in the red lips.
This species was taken by the naturalists of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross on Cozumel Island, off the east coast of Yucatan.

and fifty-six; urosteges, seventy-nine. In the specimen with twentythree rows of scales, the length of the tail euters the total four and twosevenths times; in the one with twenty-one rows, it enters four and onetenth times.
Color everywhere black, except on the chin and throat and on the inferior side of the tail. The former was reddish in life. There are very faint traces of stripes on the second, third, and fourth, and on the median dorsal rows of scales. Marksof the lateral stripe are more evident on the fourth than on the second rows of scales. No traces of spots on the parietal scuta.
This species is allied to the HL. elegans, from which it differs in its two preocular plates, in the position of the lateral stripes, and, supposing the individuals to be adult, in its small size. The color is different from that of any of the forms referred to that species.

Seales in twenty-one longitudinal rows, the inferior as deep as long, very faintly keeled, and not notched. Scales of other rows keeled, the second a little deeper than the rest, the apices feebly or not notched. Superior labials eight, fourth and fifth bounding eye, those posterior to the orbit deeper than long. Loreal deep as or deeper than long; oculars, 1-3;

<<<Page: 1058>>>

The color is variable, but a more or less distinct lateral stripe is present in all except the melanistic forms, on the second and third rows of seales. In all except the melanistic forms there is one row of lateral square spots above the lateral stripe, and in most there are two rows of spots. There are no well-defined markings on the abdominal seuta.
The labial and scale formule in this species are quite constant. In two specimens of the LH. e. plutonia the labials are eight, and the scales in twenty-one rows. In two of H.e. elegans the figures are the same. In one of HL. e. brunnea the figures are the same. In eight of the #. e. lineolata the figures are the same. In four of the H.e. hammondii the figures are the same except in one individual, where there are but nineteen rows of scales. In twenty-two specimens of LH. e. vagrans there are twenty-one rows of scales in all, and in five specimens there are seven superior labials on one side. In one only are there seven superior labials on both sides. In all the others there are eight labials on both sides. In twelve specimens of HL. e. marciana all have eight upper labials, and all but two twenty-one rows of scales. In the two the scales are in nineteen rows. Thus in fifty-one specimens there are three departures from the regular scale formula, and one entire departure and five partial departures from the labial formula.
There are seven well-marked color forms of this species, which mostly occupy distinct geographical regions, and are abundantly entitled to be called subspecies. It is indeed possible that some of them might be as well regarded as species, but the existence of transitions and the lack of importance in the characters themselves induce me to consider
them as subspecies. They are, however, in the great majority of cases”
easily recognized. The characters of these forms are as follows:

<<<Page: 1059>>>

FE. ec. elegans has been found so far in northern and central California only. The LF. e. lineolata is from the same region and from Oregon and Washington as well. The LH. e. vagrans is characteristic of the entire region between the Sierra Nevada on the west and the eastern border of the Great Plains on the east, and belongs to higher parts of the Rocky Mountain ranges as well as to the valleys between them. The B.ec. hammondii is characteristic of southern California and southern Arizona and New Mexico. The H. e. marciana belongs to the valley of the Rio Grande and adjacent regions in Texas and Mexico. It is seen from the above that the Hutenia elegans inhabits all of the Nearetic realm excepting the eastern region.
As regards transitions between the subspecies, they will be mentioned under their respective heads. I refer now to the number of the spots in each dorsal row which they present. In HE. e. vagrans this extends from eighty-four to one hundred and three in six specimens in which I counted them. In EL. e. marciana they range from fifty-two to fifty-eight in four specimens, while there are seventy-three in an otherwise typical specimen. We have here a considerable interval between the ranges. This is filled up by the LF. e. couchii, where they run from seventy-four to ninety-one in five Specimens. The number of spots is then tolerably constant, but insufficient to enable us to define species.
I have endeavored to ascertain whether there is any constancy in the number of temporal scales in them. Thus, in the typical form, LH. e. elegans, there are three rows of seales bordering the postorbital superior labials above, while in the LH. e. lineolata there are as often four as three. In one of the latter (Cat. No. 10848) there are, however, but three rows. In the HL. ¢. vagrans five specimens have four rows and five have three rows. Inthe lL. e.hammondii three have three rows and one (Cat. No. 866) has four. In the specimens of FE. e. marciana, seven have three, and three have four. The rows always have the formula 1—2-3-4,

of every other row of scales along the median and lateral stripes. On stretching the skin, these marks are seen to be parts of narrow brown crossbars, a superior row alternating with an inferior row, each occupying about a scale in width. The number of these bars is generally greater than in any other subspecies or species, ranging up to 103, but
sometimes they are as few as 84, thus equaling some of the specimens —
of EL. couchii. The ground color is alike between all of them. There is in adults a blackish cordiform mark on the nape, which represents the nuchal spot in the H. e. couchii, ete., and the top of the head is like the back, brownish clay color.
In the specimen which has served as my type (Cat. No. 8731) the tail enters the total length four and one-third times. Gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty-eight; urosteges, seventy-four; anal, one.
In young specimens the dorsal spots are more distinct, but never so large and distinct as in the H. e. lineolata. The top of the head is darker, and there are distinct nuchal spots, thus approaching the H. e. couchii. There is considerable difference in the distinctness of the spots im adults. Thus, Cat. No. 8727 (Taos, New Mexico), and Cat. No. 5497 (Fort Bridger, Wyo-
Fig. 287. ming) the spots are well marked
EUTHNIA ELEGANS VAGRANS BAIRD AND GIRARD. as in FE. e. marciana, but those
mat below the lateral stripe are not
aren Ney Seta so distinct, being represented by
traces only. In Cat. No. 926 the
top of the head and nape are black, and the labials are bordered with
the same. The specimen is small. On the other hand, in Cat. No. 3418,
no spots appear on the scales, and their existence is only discoverable by stretching the skin.
Measurements of sixteen specimens show the proportions of the tail to the total length. Cat. No, 906, three and four-fifths times; Cat. No. 8730, four and one-third; Cat. No. 8735 (2), four and one-fifth and three and four-fifths; Cat. No. 11725, three and four-fifths; Cat. No. 9514 (3), four and four and two-fifths; Cat.

This form inhabits the central regions of North America, including the three topographical divisions—the Great Plains, the Colorado Basin, and the Nevada Basin. It is not known from the Sonoran region, and occurs doubtfully in the Western, but reaches it at Walla Walla, Washington. A specimen (Cat.

Form rather slender, the tail about one-fourth the total length. Head very narrow and much elongated; the snout very narrow, but rather obtuse. The back above the third row of scales is dark uniform brownish lead-color without band, except a light olivaceous yellow; first row of scales a little darker, and similar to the abdomen, being of a very dull whitish olive. Bases of the scales of the first row black, forming a row of from 74 to 80 small spots; bases of abdominal scutes the same, the color broader toward their extremities, and generally concealed by the incumbent scute. A narrow slate-colored line along the middle of the abdomen posteriorly. Head above, dark olive; superior labials very light olive yellow, margined with black posteriorly, excepting the eighth. This is black anteriorly, its posterior end being occupied by a yellowish patch which is confluent with the yellow of the neck. Lower postorbitals yellow. Two small yellow occipital dots and a small yellow dot on each side of the posterior part of the vertical plate; these sometimes absent.
Young specimens, and older ones, after the removal of the epidermis, exhibit faint indications of a very narrow dorsal stripe upon a single row of scales, but in one there is no trace of this, even upon the neck, where it is usually visible. These specimens also exhibit traces of two series of large alternating spots, which present somewhat the appearanee of a zigzag line. In a young specimen there is a distinct series of spots on the first dorsal row, each spot covering one scale, and separated from those adjacent by two seales. Only one specimen is without the dark line upon the abdomen posteriorly. There are no irregular black blotches upon the abdomen as in LH. angustirostris. In Cat. No. 11775 the small lateral spots are ninety-one in number, thus equaling that seen in the H. e. vagrans.
The length of the tail varies within limits. Thusin Cat. No. 52196 it enters the length four and one-tenth times; in Cat. No. 8584, four and three-fifth times, and in Cat. No. 8745, four and two-third times.
Adults of this subspecies are generally easily recognized. Small specimens approach corresponding ones of the EH. e. vagrans, since they agree in the dark colored ee surface of the head, nuchal spots, and labial borders. An adult (Cat. No. 866) from the Pitt River, California, resembles an adult H.e. vagrans more than usual, but has no dorsal stripe except on the anterior frontal of the length. The nuchal spots are distinct, and the labials are blackish bordered, but the gastrosteges have black blotches at their middles and bases, as is not the case in the other specimens of H.e. couchti.. In this individual the muzzle is elongate and more compressed than usual, resembling that of the KE. multimaculata. There are also four rows of temporals. This individual represents a local race, and its habitat is out of the usual range of the species. It is the one from which the description of the E. couchii was drawn by Kennicott.
The range of this subspecies is Southern California and Arizona.

“RAPE ee
The markings about the head are generally very constant and distinct. Viewed laterally, we see first the large dark-brown patch at the back part of the head, extending as far back as the posterior extremity of the jawbones. In the anterior part of this patch is seen the erescentic patch (concave before) of yellowish white, with a more or less narrow dark-brown margin anteriorly. The next black band starts ‘rom the posterior edge of the superciliaries, and passes obliquely downward and backward along the posterior edge of the sixth upper labial. Similar black margins are seen on the posterior edges of the fifth and fourth labials, the intervening spaces being yellowish white, particularly on the fifth upper labial. Occasionally the posterior margins of the seventh and third labials have the black line as well as those mentioned, which frequently extend across to the posterior margins of the corresponding lower labials. The white spot on the anterior portion of the occipital suture is always margined with black.
The six series of black spots are arranged so as to Se a alternate with each other. EUTENIA ELEGANS MARCIANA BAIRD AND GIRARD. The lower or third series r eh
Sonora, Mexico. on each side is below the the ACN indistinct lateral stripe. The posterior edges of each abdominal scutella shows a black margined spot on each side. The dorsal line is generally a single scale in width, occasionally including portions of the lateral, and itself sometimes encroached upon by the black spots. Each spot is about a seale or a scale and a half long and about three scales broad. The number in the dorsal series from the head to the anus varies from fifty-six to sixty, but in Cat. No. 860 they number seventy-three. Posterior edges of scales very slightly emarginate, if at all. All are decidedly keeled.

The tail measures into the total length as follows: Cat. No. 844 (type),
four and one-tenth times; Cat. No. 7235, four and three-fifths; Cat. No. 404, four; Cat. No. 5351, four; Cat. No. 8416, four and two-fifths; Cat. No. 1418, four and one-fourth.
Asin FE. e. vagrans, the top of the head is black in young specimens. In very large specimens an approximation to the LH. e. vagrans is seen the paling of the dorsal spots by the restriction of the black color to
the skin and its disappearance from the scales.
The spots below the
lateral lines become especially indistinct, and this is important, since these are one of the distinguishing features of the species (Cat. Nos.
8116, 8117).
so that the subspecies is always easily distinguished.
The range of this species is rather restricted, being confined to the Rio Grande Valley and a limited region on each side of it to its mouth. In Texas it extends as far east as San Antonio.

This form is quite different from any of those enumerated as subspecies of HH. elegans, but it resembles considerably the LH. sirtalis

The distribution of colors is quite the same as in that form,
but the red between the lateral spots is of a chestnut color, and not

Besides the characters mentioned, this form has a yellow dorsal stripe which is well defined, covering one and two half rows of scales, The lateral stripe is defined below by a brown shade, which fades into the brownish olive of the belly below. The spots of the inferior lateral row are large and are confluent above with the wide black dorso lateral band. No nuchal spots, but the dark color of the back continues inte the brown of the top of the head. Superior labials brownish olive; the posterior narrow by brown bordered; chin and throat yellow. Gastrosteges unspotted, 156 in number. Tail injured; the base with a triangular section. Length of body, 490 mm. One specimen from San Francisco, California. Baird and Girard enumerate their specimens all from California, and two of them from San Francisco.

EUTAENIA ANGUSTIROSTRIS Kennicott.
Kutenia angustirostris KeNNIcoTT, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 332.— Cork, Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 41.
Body moderately stout; tail less than one-fourth the total length and very small. Head exceedingly elongated and narrow, more so than any other of the genus; snout very long, narrow, and pointed. Crown plane above; eye large. Upper labials eight, sixth largest, seventh scarcely smaller, Dorsal rows twenty-one; outer row large, very faintly carinated ; the second smaller but broader than the third; the next rather Fig. 290. large and elongated, and strongly WUTANIA ANGUSTIROSTRIS KENNICOTT. carinated.

The back above the third row of scales is dark brown without spots, but with each scale bordered with darker. The scales of the second and third row are grayish olive, with distinct yellow borders. The first

<<<Page: 1072>>>

and abdomen are ashy olive, with irregular heavy black blotches upon the latter, more numerous along the middle third, but offering no indisation of a narrow black line asin LH. elegans couchti. On the first three rows some scattered scales have black spots on their bases and edges. Head above dark olive; upper labials light olive with vertical edgings.
A young specimen is entirely black; the dorsal stripe obsolete, being indicated only by a faint line on a single row of scales; the lateral stripes very indistinct; the first and part of the second row of scales entirely black. A whitish line along each side of the abdomen formed by a white spot at the end of each scute. These are also margined posteriorly with the same color. Throat whitish.
The remarkable elongation of the snout will distinguish this species from any others at present known, excepting H. multimaculata, from which it differs in other respects. The snout is more elongated, and decidedly more pointed than in FH. e. couchii or EH. leptocephala; the head is not at all depressed anteriorly as in H. leptocephala, and the eye is strikingly larger, The colors of the back and abdomen are darker, and the rows of scales are twenty-one, not nineteen. As compared with EH. e. couchii, which it most nearly resembles, beside the difference in the form of the snout, the head is depressed posteriorly (not anteriorly); hence the crown is quite plane throughout, while in EE. e. couchit the crown is somewhat arched, this form being more observable upon the occipital and frontal region. In LH. angustirostris _the general form is stouter, while the head is longer, and hence a greater elongation of the frontal and parietal plates. The scales of the upper rows are also larger and more elongated, and more strongly carinate. The tail is stouter, being considerably less than one-fourth the total length, while in HL. e. couchii it is fully or more than one-fourth. This member is also very slender, the body tapering abruptly near the anus in the former species. The dorsal stripe, though narrow, is not wanting, and the abdomen is much darker, being ashy olive, with heavy black blotches throughout, instead of light yellow or grayish olive, and there is no indication of the central line. The young specimen is strikingly different from the young of FH. e. couchii.
Temporals 1-2-3 on one side and 1-3-4 on the other. The tail is longer than in F. elegans, entering the total length three and one-fourth times.
But one specimen has been thus far obtained. The elongate muzzle, narrow labial plates, and longer tail distinguish it from the allied species. The coloration is also quite peculiar, and may be characteristic, as the specimen is small.

Ground color above, light reddish brown; below, pale green. Three longitudinal stripes above, the median narrow more or less of its length on one row of seales, the lateral on the second and third row of seales. Two rows of black spots occupy the space between the stripes. These spots generally combine into a single row of large spots on the anterior part of the body, but do not in one specimen (Cat. No. 8067, the type). They also frequently join at their angles, forming a zigzag black band. A row of large jet-black spots below the lateral stripe alternates with the spots of the inferior row. Belly immaculate.
This well marked species has the slenderness of body, and in one form the length of tail, of the Hutania proxima, but it has a head and scales of the FL. elegans type. It is characterized by the narrowness of the dorsal stripe, together with the huge black nuchal spots.
It is represented by four subspecies, which differ as follows:
I. Dorsal stripe on three rows of scales on anterior half of body. Stripes yellow, not black bordered. No conspicuous spots below lateral stripe.

Eutania cyrtopsis KENNicor?, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 333.—CopkE, Check-list N. Amer. Batr. Rept., 1875, p. 41.
Form very slender, but little stouter than that of H. sawrita, but with shorter tail, one-fourth the total length. Head large. Eye very large. Superior labials eight, sixth and seventh largest. Three postorbitals, upper much the largest. Scales in nineteen rows. Color above olive brown, appearance of a zigzag line. Dorsal stripe whitish, narrow, distinct to the tip of the tail. Lateral stripe on the second and third rows of the same color, broad, distinct from head to anus. A series of black spots on the first dorsal row; abdomen uniform greenish white. Orbitals whitish; occipital spots obsolete.
This snecies somewhat resembles H. marciana in the pattern of coloration, which, however, has the lateral stripe upon the third row only, instead of the third and seeond. The difference in form is most striking, the body being almost as slender as in
J. saurita. The scales are rather larger than in #. marciana, and those of the first row more elongated. The ground color above the lateral stripe is olive brown. The first dorsal row is whitish olive or greenish white. The abdomen is uniform greenish

Cat. No. 8062, U.S.N.M, seute. The whitish dorsal
row occupies one, and less
than two half rows of seales, and is encroached upon by the black dorsal blotches, which sometimes reach the central row. The lateral stripe is also encroached upon by the spots above and below it, though never entirely interrupted by them near the head, as in 4. marciana. The head is dark olive above; labials margined vertically with black, somewhat as in H. marciana, except the seventh plate, which in the former is heavily bordered with black on both edges; in the latter slightly upon the anterior edge alone. There is a vertical light patch at the angle of the mouth crossing the posterior upper labial, and confluent with the white of the neck and not distinct and crescentshaped, as in #, marciana. Behind the occipital plates is a very large double black blotch. Behind this there are three or four perfect square blotches extending quite from the dorsal to the lateral stripe, each three scales in length, and separated by intervals of about two scales wide. Behind these the general pattern of spots is seen. It consists of two

series of large, oblong, rhomboidal, alternating spots, each about four scales long, and somewhat confluent with each other at the adjacent corners, giving the appearance of a zigzag line upon each side. On the first and second dorsal rows is a third series of very distinct black spots, each on parts of three scales, and the extremities of two abdominal scutes, The intervening spaces of greenish white ground color are equal in width to the spots.

Other specimens have the dorsal stripe on a single row of scales and the lateral stripe has its upper border regular and distinet, without interruption from the middle series of spots, the lower edge as in the specimen above described. Instead of the distinet spots upon the first and second rows in that specimen, they are here broken up into black borders of three approximated scales. In the only large specimen of this variety the keels of the first dorsal row are not parallel to those of the rows above, being directed obliquely downward and backward, so that the posterior end of one keel falls below the anterior end of the next succeeding, instead of forming a continuous line. The nose of this specimen is also more pointed than in the typical one.
The lengths of the tails in this subspecies are as follows: Cat. No. 8067 (2) three and one-half and three and one-twelfth times in total length; Cat. No. 5023, three and one-fifth times.

Scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, the inferior smooth anteriorly, but keeled posteriorly. Eightsuperior labials; loreal higher than long; temporals 1-2-3, the anterior large. The lateral band on the second and third rows of scales cream-colored; dorsal band extending to the end of the tail, orange red. The usual alternating square black spots between the two bands; the scales in the light interspaces black or deep brown. Anteriorly the lateral black spots unite into a single series of subquadrate spots. The lower borders of the lower series of spots invade the lateral band, sometimes cutting it entirely off into seetions of regular length. Below the middle of each section, and therefore alternating with the inferior lateral spots, is another black spot,

relating to the arched light bar above it, as pupil to eyebrow. The superior lateral spots in like manner invade the median dorsal] band, either cutting it off entirely or giving it a laterally undulatory course. Its width is alternately one and one and a half rows of scales. A dark-
gray shade connects the lateral
olive-lead colored; the gastrosteges with blackish bases at the extremities. A large black spot behind the occipital plates, extending to below the angles of the

are without black borders. The dorsal stripe occupies the middle and parts of two adjacent rows of scales on the anterior half of the length, and one row on the posterior half, and is continued to the end of the tail. The lateral stripe covers two entire rows of scales except on the posterior half, where it occupies the second row only. It is bordered ° below by a band of a rather lighter brown than that of the space above it, on the first row of scales, and on the angles of the gastrosteges which enter between the separate scales of the latter. Every other scale of tle first row has a black speck at its upper and lower base. Belly immaculate yellow, except a black shade at the base of the extremity of a few of the scuta, which is only visible on stretching the latter apart.
This handsome form resembles the Hutenia elegans brunnea in general form and appearance, but the latter has no nuchal spots nor black labial borders nor band beneath the lateral stripe. It belongs to a

I have seen but one specimen of this species, which I obtained near
Lake Vailey, in southern New Mexico. There is no specimen in the United States National Museum.

EUTANIA BRACHYSTOMA Cope.
Lutenia brachystoma Corr, American Naturalist, 1892, p. 964, fig.—BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, p. 418 (#. leplocephala).
But one specimen of this species has yet been obtained. It is small, but not young, and it belongs to the group of which #. sirtalis and E. leptocephala are members. It resembles both these species, but differs in important particulars. The labial plates are six above and eight below, instead of seven above and ten below. The head is not distinet from the neck, resembling in this respect the Tropidocloniwm lineatum. The parietal scuta are convex in outline and not contracted posteriorly. The head plates are otherwise as in those species, including oculars 1-3, temporals1-2; and postgeneials longer than pregeneials. Scalesin nine-
teen series, all keeled except the inferior row, which has a trace of a
keel. Gastrosteges, one hundred and thirty-two; anal, one; urosteges, seventy-two.
Color below and upper lip light olive, unspotted; above darker olive, with a broad, brown band on each side, which extends from the fourth

<<<Page: 1080>>>

to the middle of the ninth row, inclusive, leaving a pale dorsal stripe of ground color one and two half scales wide. Chin and anal plate yellowish. No parietal pair of spots visible to the eye, but traces appearunder a magnifier,
Measurements.—Total length, 286 mm.; tail, 71 mm.
The reduction of the number of labial plates is not effected by the fusion of the fifth and sixth of the FH. sirtalis, as I at first suggested, since the abbreviation of the plate, which, though longer than those adjacent to it, does not equal the two plates in the H. sirtalis, and the sutures of the last two labials in no wise correspond with those of the other species. The normality of the structure is confirmed by the reduction of the inferior labial series by two scales, all of which are of perfectly normal form. The gastrosteges are fewer in number than in any #. sirtalis or H. leptocephala known to me, while the number of urosteges remains as in those species. The inferior scale of the second row of temporals is almost obliterated on one side. The absence of spots on
the gastrosteges distinguishes it from Fig. 296. most of the subspecies of HF. sirtalis. EUT®NIA BRACHYSTOMA COPE. The general form is that of TropiSh
doclonium, aud the distinctness of the TYP: two nasal plates is the only external feature which separates it from that genus. It is one of the forms—of which several are now known— which, while retaining the general features of the water snakes, have adopted a terrestrial life and more or less burrowing habits.
Dr. Boulenger, in commenting on this species, supposes it to be a FR. leptocephala, questioning the correctness of the locality. There is, however, no mistake as to this latter point. It has a superior labial less and twelve gastrosteges less than the smallest number L have met with in that species.

Measurements.—Type: Total length, 590 mm; of tail, 128 mm.
Color varying from light reddish brown to black, with dorsal and lateral stripes present or absent. When the lateral spots are present they are small, are ranged along the borders of the stripes, or their positions, and are not in contact with each other. Belly varying from black to olive with blackish shades on the bases or more of the gastrosteges, and without definite spots on the extremities of the latter.
This variable species may be distinguished from £. sirtalis, its nearest ally, by the narrow, scarcely distinct head, more strongly grooved preocular region; the small size of the dorsal spots when present, and the absence of spots on the ends of the gastrosteges. There are, however, Some specimens in which the head is of much the shape of that of the BP. sirtalis, and some of the latter (/. s. graminea) have no spots on the ends of the gastrosteges. The majority of the specimens of the E. leptocephala differ further in the presence of two preocular scales, and about half of the specimens have but seventeen rows of scales. On specimens of the latter kind the W. cooperit and H. atrata were established, Of twenty-six specimens examined, twelve have the scales

in seventeen rows, and fourteen in nineteen rows. In some of those with nineteen rows the additional row extends but a short distance on each side, so that for all but a small part of the length there are seventeen rows. In thirteen individuals there is but one preocular on each side; in two there are one on one side and two on the other, and in eleven individuals there are two on each side. Two preoculars prevail in the spotted types, for of eight of these but three have a single preocular. Five of the black and well-striped specimens have two preoculars on both sides, and two have two on one side and one on the other, while all of the uniform colored specimens, whether light or dark, have but one preocular on both sides. The grooving of the preocular region is generally, but not invariably, present. In several specimens the secoud or third rows of temporals are represented by a single plate, appropriately to the small size of the head.
The color varieties are as follows: Brown, with blackish spots, moderately distinct stripes (eleven specimens); black, with the dorsal and generally the lateral stripe well defined (eight specimens); black, with stripes and spots very indistinct (five specimens); black with dorsal stripe only (2. atrata) (one specimen); uniform brownish or olive (three specimens).
These forms have no distinct geographical range, examples of all of them coming from Puget Sound. As a whole, the species belongs to the Pacific coast, not south of San Francisco. How far east it ranges is not known, but I have never seen it from central Oregon or Washington. One specimen (Cat. No. 5208) in the U. S. National Museum collection is marked as coming from the ‘*‘ Rocky Mountains.”
An interesting series of eight specimens was obtained by Mr. 8. N. Rhoads—five from Tacoma and three from Victoria, British Columbia. He did not obtain it from any locality east of the latter point. In my paper on the “ Characters and variations of the snakes of North America,”! I state that of the specimens in the U. S. National Museum rather less than half have two preocular plates, and one-half have seventeen and the other half nineteen rows of scales. Of the eight specimens brought by Mr, Rhoads, six have two and two have three preoculars, one of the latter coming from Tacoma and one from Victoria; six have seventeen rows of scales and two have nineteen, both the latter from Tacoma. The distinctive characters of the species are thus confirmed. The ground color in two of the Tacoma specimens is black and the others brown. All of the Victoria specimens are brown, and two of them have a red dorsal stripe.

Tropidonotus scalaris BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 204.
Form moderately slender, the tail a little less than one-fourth the total length. Head narrow, elevated, the profile sloping in front; muzzle obtuse. Temporal small, not attaining the reduced last upper labial. Front of plate narrow, half as wide as long, with concave or parallel lateral borders. Occipitals elongate. Loreal plate higher than long; one preocular, three postoculars. Superior labials, seven; tourth and fifth entering the orbit. Inferior labials, ten. Anterior geneials longer than posterior. Scales in nineteen rows, not emarginate; lateral stripe on the second and third rows. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-three; an entire anal; urosteges, fifty-nine pair.
Beneath and upon the first row of scales, dark, ashy olivaceous, the latter frequently black at their bases. Second and one-half the third row of scales a little paler. The vertebral and the borders of one row on each side of it yellowish. The color of the remainder of the upper surface is brown, anteriorly shaded with olivaceous. This is crossed from the lateral to the dorsal stripe on each side by black or deepbrown transverse bars, numbering, from the head to the origin of the tail, about sixty. There is a pair of large spots just behind the occipital plates, and one involving the temporals and the whole of the occipitals, its anterior border trilobate and produced upon the vertical and superciliaries. A short yellowish vitta, extending from the posterior

Eutenia cyrtopsis var. phenax Bocourt, Miss. Sci. Mex., 1893, p. 778.
This is a handsome and peculiar species, being the only one of the genus which is cross-banded.
Seales in nineteen rows; all keeled except the first. General form much as in HL. sirtalis. Head rather short, muzzle obtuse, eye large, superciliary plates arched. Diameter of eye equal from same to rostral plate along the labials. Frontal shortened behind, with straight sides, equal to .75 of parietal common suture. Parietals truncate behind. Upper labials, eight; fourth and fifth in orbit. Loreal longer than high, one preocular, temporals 1-2. Inferior labials nine, sixth largest; geneials equal. Gastrosteges, one hundred and sixty-one; anal, one; urosteges, sixty-three.
Measurements.—Total length, 23 inches 5 lines; tail, 5 inches; to rictus oris, 6 lines.
Above, reddish olive, crossed by thirty-six transverse spots, which are of a bright brownish-red with a narrow black margin. They are separated by transverse intervals of only a scale in width, hence the black margins appear as paired crossbars. These crossbars extend to the first row of scales and are as often continuous on the side as not. There is no lateral stripe, but there are black spots on the corners of the ends of the gastrosteges. The margin of the first brown spot is in form of two black lines diverging from the parietal plates backward. There is a brown bar in front of the frontal, one on the frontal, and superceiliaries behind (imperfect), and a longitudinal on each parietal. No pair of light parietal spots. Labials below eye with the last black margined, otherwise light olive. Below, a strong green, unspotted. Sometimes the brown spots are interrupted on the middle line, in the position of the dorsal stripe seen in so many species of Hutenia, but this is very exceptional, and the ground color shows no trace of stripes.
The E. phenax is one of the smaller species and is, so far as now known, confined to eastern Mexico.

Tropidonotus ordinatus var. eques BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 209.
Seales in nineteen rows. Lower row of scales smooth; urosteges, sixty-seven; a dorsal stripe; lateral stripe bordered below by a brown or black stripe; a black nuchal spot; head brown.
At first sight this species looks like the #. flavilabris Cope, but it has characters of the H. eques and adds some of its own.
The dorsal stripe, as in H. eques, occupies but a single row of scales. The lateral stripe occupies the adjacent edges of the second and third rows. The entire first row is covered by a broad brown band, which defines the lateral light band very distinctly below. This is not seen in either of the species above named. There are two rows of black spots between the dorsal and lateral bands, but the keels of all the seales involved in them are brown. There are sometimes spots below the lateral light line on the neck, due to interruptions in the lateral dark stripe. A large nuchal black spot, which is notched behind by the median band and sometimes divided. Superior labials black-bordered posteriorly, especially the sixth, where the border is sometimes very wide. Head above brown; lower surfaces uniform greenish, except tail, which is yellowish below. Occipital spots very indistinct.
The head is not very distinct from the neck. The frontal plate is wider than the supraorbitals. Gastrosteges, one hundred and fi‘tyeight; urosteges, sixty-seven.
Measurements.—Total length, 465 mm.; lengtlr of tail, 105 mm.
This handsome species varies in the intensity of its dark colors, the ground between the dorsal spots being sometimes so dark as to give the spaces between the yellow stripes the appearance of uniform bands. In such specimens the lateral dark stripe is least interrupted.
Boulenger unites this species with the H. eques. It, however, belongs to a different section of the genus.
According to Duges, this species is found in the States of Guanajuato and Mexico. I have three specimens from the State of Mexico, from Mr. Hoeje; four from the State of Puebla, from the Exploring Commission, and one from Zacualtipan (Hidalgo), from Dr. 8. Bernad.

Kutenia cyrtopsis var. sumichrasti Bocour?, Miss. Sci. Mex., 1893, p. 775.
Seales in nineteen rows; no longitudinal bands. Olive brown, with four series of small black spots, and a trace of two exterior anteriorly; eight superior labials, all higher than long except the seventh, no black margin on the sixth or posterior margin of eighth, but a strong black band from eye across posterior margin of seventh to mouth. Sides of head white, extending upward as two areas, margining each occipital; behind each a black nuchal spot separated by a narrow white line from its fellow and extending over occipital plates and half of frontal; prefrontals transverse.
The markings of this species are entirely peculiar; it is also distinguished by the transverse or narrow prefrontals and internasals.
To this deseription I add some notes taken from a third specimen. The frontal plate is wider than the supraorbitals. There are eight superior labials, and the orbit is bounded by the fourth and fifth. Temporals, 1-2; orbitals, 1-3. There is a trace of a dorsal stripe on the nape, which divides the nuchal spot into two. No postoral crescent. Below the square lateral spots on the sides of the neck is a row of smaller, alternating square spots, which serve to define a lateral stripe for a short distance. Superior labials brownish yellow, brown edged. Inferior surfaces uniform dirty yellow.
The keels of the scales are very strong, except those of the first row, which are obsolete. Gastrosteges, one hundred and forty-eight; urosteges, sixty-five.
Measurements.—TYotal length, 265 mm.; length of tail, 65 mm., or onefourth of the total.

Tropidonotus chrysocephalus BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., I, 1893, p. 203.
Seales in seventeen rows, inferior row heeled; urosteges, eighty-one; no dorsal stripe; alarge black nuchal spot; head yeilow; body slender, with a wide flat head, with a large eye. The size of the latter contracts the frontal plate, so that itis not wider than the superciliaries posteriorly. Thescuta are otherwise as usual. Superior labials, eight, none higher than long, fourth and fifth below the orbit. The inferior surfaces are darker than in HL. eques collaris, which causes a better definition of the lateral line than in that species. There are representations of two rows of lateral black spots, but they are merely black scale borders, those of the inferior row the more distinct. A similar row of black edges on the first row of scales. All of these spots become distinct on the sides of the neck. Nuchal spot large, black, and with a shallow notch behind, no occipital or other spots on the head. The gastrosteges have black bases, a character not seen in any of the other species referred to.
Gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty-one.
Measurements.—Total length, 430 mm.; length of tail, 135 inm., or one-third the total.
This handsome species was obtained at Orizaba by Dr. Sumichrast. Boulenger ' records it from Omilteme, in the State of Guerrero, which is at an elevation of 8,000 feet.

Head distinct oval; muzzle and orbit medium. Body moderately robust; tail between one-fourth and one-fifth the total length, very rarely shorter than one-fifth or larger than one-fourth. Superior labial plates eight, all higher than long, except the first and second. Loreal not longer than high; oculars ‘at 3; temporals 1-2-8. Frontal much wider than superciliaries; “qe rather short. Scales in nineteen rows, not very narrow, not emarginate except the inferior three rows; the first as deep as long and feebly keeled. Postgeneials longer than pregeneials, generally separated to the base by small scales.
Color varying from light green through olivaceous to black, traversed by three longitudinal stripes, of which the laterals are not well defined below, and all three may be wanting. Spaces between them uniform, or marked by two rows of alternating black or brown spots, of which those of the superior row may or may not be confluent with each other. In most of the forms there is a round black spot on the anterior part of each gastrostege about 5 mm. from the end. Belly generally light bluish green, but varying to darker and black.
This species ranges over all North America, being limited to the north by its capacity for enduring cold and extending south to Guate. mala. In its essential characters it is quite constant, but it varies in color so as to include several races or subspecies. Of one hundred and two specimens examined but three have twenty-one rows of scales, the rest having nineteen. Of the same number examined but six have eight superior labials on both sides, and the additional labial is generally smaller than the others so as to be an evident abnormality, though sometimes itisregular. In nine specimens the additional labial appears on one side only. These abnormalities are distributed as follows:

Transitions between these forms are common. The disappearance of the spots and stripes of EH. s. sirtalis, which culminates in the HF. s. graninea, does not occur abruptly, but transitional specimens are not difficult to find. Transitions to the dark form, E. s. obscura, are not rare, the spots becoming, as in the corresponding case in L. elegans, confused and blended on the posterior part of the body first. The transition to the absence of spots also appears first posteriorly, Cat. No. 7798 having anteriorly the color marking of FE. e. parietalis, and posteriorly that of HE. e. dorsalis. On the other hand, the #. e. parietalis shows every gradation to the form EF. e. obscura, by confluence of the spots. The spots are largest and fewest in LH. s. sirtalis, where they range from seventy-six to seventy-eight. In H.s. parietalis they are more numerous, ranging from eighty-three to eighty-eight. LH. s. dorsalis covers both Series, ranging from seventy to eighty-one.

This form is the extreme in the direction taken by the L. s. ordinata, where the bands are entirely wanting, but the quadrate lateral spots remain. In the entire absence of black marks on the labial and abdominal plates, this form differs also from its immediate allies. The coloration is that of Cyclophis wstivus.
In a second specimen (Cat. No. 14642) from Tuckermuck, Massachusetts, a smali spot is to be seen on a few of the gastrosteges, while on two from Columbus, Fig. 298.

In the most typical specimen of this species (Cat. No. 5222; northern Alabama), the dorsal spots of the superior row connect across the middle line, and do not connect with the spots of the inferior row. The form which is common about the eastern shore of Buzzards Bay and other parts of Massachusetts (Cat. No. 13330) has the same char-. acter, but the spots are larger and the general colors darker.
This form or subspecies passes in one direction into the H. s. graminea, and in the other into the EF. s. sirtalis, as the spots and bands are more or less distinct. The spots are very indistinct in Cat. Nos. 1023, 1047, 1049, 1050, 7808, 8991, and 14752, and traces of the stripes are visible in Cat. Nos. 996, 1023, 1049, and 14732.
A specimen (Cat. No. 1033) from Blount County, Tennessee, is a melanistic form of this subspecies. The color is entirely black, except that the narrow interspaces between the large square alternate; lateral spots are a little paler; chin, throat, and superior labials below orbit, yellowish.

Color above the lateral stripes dark olive, in old specimens dark brown, beneath greenish white. A narrow, rather indistinct vertebral greenish-yellow line. Three series of small indistinet spots on each side, of about seventy from head to anus. The first series is along the exterior dorsal row, the spots about two scales apart. This is sometimes entirely wanting. The second series is on the third, fourth, and

fifth rows from the abdomen; the third upon theeighth and ninth. In many cases the last-mentioned rows have the spots on opposite sides more or less confluent, giving the appearance of a single median series. These rows of spots are sometimes of a dark chestnut-brown, at others nearly black, and often so blended with the olivaceous of the back as to be searcely discernible. Numerous short white lines visible on stretching the skin.
Although the first, second, and third exterior dorsal rows of scales are colored like the abdomen, yet a lighter shade on the second and third gives indication of a lateral stripe.
The bases of the abdominal scales on each side near the outer extremities have a black blotch. There is also the usual double spot on the oeciput, not areolated. The dark spotting on the sides belongs more or less to the skin between the scales, in some cases merely tinging the edges of the latter.
The relative length of the tail to the total, as observed in 38 specimens, is as follows: Five and one-fifth times in total length, 1 specimen; five and one-fifteenth, 1 specimen; four and eleven-twelfths, 1; four and five-sixths, 2; four and four-fifths, 2; four and three-fourths, 5; four and three-fifths, 1; four and two-fifths 3; four and one-third, 1; four and one-fourth, 1; four and one-fifth, 1; four and one-eighth, 2; four and one-sixth, 3; four and one-tenth, 1; four and one-twelfth, 2; four, 2; three and nine-tenths, 1; three and three-fourths, 2.
The definition of the spots in this subspecies varies, some having them of smaller and others of larger size, thus exposing more or less of the ground color.
The H. s. sirtalis is the most abundant snake of the eastern region, and it iscommon in the Austroriparian, including the Floridan district. Its occurrence in the Texan district is uncertain, as I have not seen it from west of Dallas on the north and Galveston on the south. From the fact that it occurs in the wet portions of eastern Mexico and Guatemala I suspect that it will be also found in southern Texas.
Specimens derived from the Central, Pacific, and Sonoran regions, referred to this subspecies by various persons, I find on examination to be referable to other species or subspecies. No specimens of the EL. sirtalis sirtalis have come under my observation from those regions. The most western locality from which the National Museum possesses a specimen is Fort Kearney (now Junction City), Kansas, which is at the western limit of the eastern third of that State; Cat. No. 621.
A color variation is exhibited by Cat. No. 1008, from Bedford, Long Island, New York, where the black spots of the superior rows connect with each other across the median dorsal stripe, cutting the latter into sections. A corresponding peculiarity is seen in some specimens of FE. s. ordinata. In Cat. No. 9992 the spots approach, but do not join.!

Scales in nineteen rows; superior labials, seven. Lower rows of scales wide, smooth. The head is not very distinct from the neck. The frontal plate is wider than the supraorbitals. Gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty-eight; urosteges, sixty-seven.
Measurements.—Total length, 465 mm.; of tail, 105 mm.
The dorsal stripe, as in KH. eques, occupies but a single row of scales. The lateral stripe occupies the adjacent edges of the second and third rows. The entire first row is covered by a broad brown or black band, which defines the lateral light band very distinctly below. This is not seen in either of the species above named. There are two rows of black spots between the dorsal and lateral bands, but the keels of all the scales involved in them are brown or yellow. There are no spots below the lateral light line, either on the neck or elsewhere. A large nuchal black spot, which is notched behind by the median band. Fifth superior labial yellow; the sixth black, with a yellow spot in the superior anterior corner. Seventh, black-edged in front; others blackbordered behind. A yellow postoral spot. Head above black or brown; lower surfaces uniform greenish-yellow, except tail, which has a median dark line below. Occipital spots very indistinct.
This handsome species has been sent me froin Pueblo and central Mexico and from Zacualtipan Hidalgo. The typical specimen was received from Dr. Dugés, of Guanajuato, but the exact locality is unknown. It may enter the Nearctie fauna.

Prof. O. P. Hay! gives the following account of the habits of Hutenia sirtalis sirtalis :
As to LE, 8. sirtalis, Prof. . W. Putnam ® states that a female taken July 22 contained forty-two nearly developed young. Each of these was 54 inches long. The mother snake was 35 inches long. Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel, Illinois, writes* that seventy-eight were taken from a female. He implies that he saw this done. C.

<<<Page: 1095>>>

Few Seiss says' that the sexes of this species copulate in early spring and produce from thirteen to eighty young. That he has seen the latter from a single snake he does not say. Drs. Coues and Yarrow refer? to the habits of Eutewnia sirtalis parietalis as observed by them in Montana during the monthof August. ‘At this season of the year all the female individuals observed were gravid with nearly matured embryos. Like others of the genus, this species is ovoviviparous, the young being 6 inches in length when born.” In aspecimen of EL. s. sirtalis (No. 17960, U.S.N.M.), captured near the city of Indianapolis by Dr. Alex. Jameson about August 1, I find thirty-nine partially developed young. Of these, twenty-five are in the right uterus, The young measures 6 inches in length. There is a considerable amount of yolk still remaining attached to these young, a fact which indicates that they will increase in size before birth. An examination of the mouth of some of these little snakes shows that the egg-tooth is present. The membrane which surrounds each egg is quite thin. The female bearing this lot of young is 33 inches in length. Another female (No. 17961, U.S.N.M.), from Paris, Illinois, of nearly the same size, contained about thirty-five young snakes, these being packed together so densely in the mother’s body that it was difficult to determine the number accurately without removing them. They are each 7 inches long, and are evidently just ready to be expelled. An examination of about half a dozen of them failed to reveal the presence of the egg-tooth, which has therefore been shed. Nor could I determine with certainty that any egg-covering was present. The yoik of the egg, also, is wholly consumed. On opening these young snakes I find little or none of the yolk within the body. In this respect they contrast strongly with the young of the rattlesnakes. The young garter snakes must from the first depend on their own activities for support. This accords well with the report of Mr. C. Few Seiss, that the young of a female kept in confinement began to feed shortly after birth, struggling vigorously with one another for the earthworms thrown them. At what time during the summer the Paris, Illinois, specimen was captured I do not know. Seiss’s statement that the sexes of LH. s. sirtalis pair in the early spring has already been mentioned.
Prof. F. W. Putnam® informs us that on July 1, in a female 35 inches long he found forty-two nearly developed young, each of which was 5.5 incheslong. Dr. J. Schneck, of Mount Carmel, Illinois, says * that from a female 35 inches Jong he took seventy-eight young from 3 to 7 inches in length. They were pressed from the vent. The first twenty were free, the others confined within the egg coverings. A female from Paris, Illinois, contained thirty-five young, each 7 inches long. The food-yolk was all gone and the egg-tooth shed. It appears that the young are born late in the summer or early in the fall. The sexes are said to unite in September or in October, but it seems probable that this also occurs early in the spring. This is one of the snakes which has the reputation of swallowing its young when they are in peril. Col. N. Pike, who is an accurate observer, assured Dr. Goode* that he had seen the garter snake afford its young family temporary protection in its throat, from which they were soon noticed to emerge.
On the approach of cold weather these snakes seek some opening in the earth and then become dormant. In some instances they appear to collect in considerable numbers where they pass their winter slumber. We thus occasionally hear of bundles of snakes being plowed up. E. L. Ellicott relates® having seen very early in the spring, in Maryland, a bundle of garter snakes in which some hundreds of them could be counted. It is altogether probable that such assemblages are determined partly by the sexual impulses. The garter snake leaves its place of hibernation apparently as soon as the first warm days come, although they may relapse again into the dormant condition. At Irvington I have taken them as early as the 7th of March.

Dr. Benjaman Sharp! observed the process of exuviation in the garter snake, Two specimens were kept in an aquariam. When observed one had just crawled out of the water-and then shrugged and shook itself. Finding a narrow place, it pressed itself in so that the skin parted along the jaws. ‘This was pushed back behind the head. Then the snake crawled through the opening, escaping from the skin and leaving it turned inside out. The operation required less than a minute. One of the skins was without rent or loss of a scale. This occurred on April 13. Some specimens that I kept for a while shed the skin about June 1. In case the snake can not have access to water the shedding of the skin is a more prolonged
operation. Butania sirtalis sirtalis Linnwus.

A specimen described by Baird and Girard under the head of Hutenia sirtalis, from Westport, New York, is uniformly blackish between the longitudinal stripes, when the epidermis is removed, and brown when it is present, the black spots being entirely fused. The keels of the scales are of a lighter brown. The belly is grayish green, with black spots near the ends of the gastrosteges, extending from

In no other specimen have the spots disappeared by fusion, leaving the stripes intact, so perfectly as in this specimen. In those individuals (Cat.

In a specimen in my private collection from Mitchells Bay, Ontario (Dr. J.H.

It resembles in general the LH. s. sirtalis in colors and proportions. The lower surfaces and the stripes are olivaceous, and the lateral and median stripes are separated by two rows of spots, which occupy the entire width of the space on the skiu, but which do not touch each other as scale markings, the upper row being ranged along the median stripe Fig. 302. and the lower along EUTZNIA SIRTALIS SEMIFASCIATA COPE. the lateral stripe. The ee peculiarity of the form eae: consists in the fact that on the anterior fifth or sixth of the Jength of the body the spots of the inferior row extend across the lateral stripe, breaking it up into sections. In many of the specimens the spots of the superior row become opposite to those of the inferior row and join them, and the latter again join a row which is below the lateral stripe. The three rows of spots thus become confluent from crossbars interrupted only by the median dorsal stripe, as in the Lutenia scalaris. The bars are much less regular than in that species, the part that crosses the lateral stripe being distinctly contracted and the superior part being much widened.
Young specimens recently hatched (150 mm.) exhibit the same color character as the adults.
In four specimens (Cat. No. 8070) of this form the tail measures, respectively, four and eleven-twelfths, four and two-fifths, four and three fifths, four and five sixths of the total length. Gastrosteges in one of the same, one hundred and fifty-three; anal, one; urosteges, sixty-one.
Measurements.—Length of same specimen, 520 mm.; length of tail, 104 mm. Length of a larger specimen, 914 mmn.; of tail, 196 mm. In sey-

This subspecies is quite distinct in appearance from the L. s. sirtalis in life, and may be also readily distinguished in spirits after the disappearance of the bright red colors. It has also a definite geographical range.

Lower surfages and lateral stripe olivaceous; gastrostegeés with a small black spot near each end. Dorsal stripe red, with a delicate black or deep brown border on each side. Space between dorsal and lateral stripes brown, marked with a single series of small black spots, which occupy parts of three rows of scales next to the lateral stripe, and do not, therefore, reach the dorsal stripe. Spaces between the lateral spots red.
The gastrostegal spots are smaller than in the H. s. sirtalis,and are more isolated and rounded; sometimes they are not present on some of the gastrosteges. The labial plates are very little or not at all blackbordered. Parietal spots distinct.

The range of this subspecies is the same as that of the H. elegans marciana, namely, the drainage basin of the Rio Grande. The locality, “Platte River,” given by Yarrow, requires confirmation. Other localities given by the same author are erroneous.

Above light-olive brown; beneath slate color. Longitudinal stripes greenish. Spaces about and between the dark spots on the sides, brick red, these colors belonging to the skin, not to the scales.
Above dark olive, beneath light-slate color, except the inferior surface of the head, which is yellowish white. A broad longitudinal dorsal line of one and two half rows of scales, and an equally distinct one on each side on the second and third dorsal rows, of a greenish slate. The sides of the abdomen and the exterior dorsal row are darkslate brown. When the skin is stretched, there are seen on each side, between the dorsal and lateral rows, two rows of quadrate black blotches, the first quite distinct, between the third and sixth rows; the second between the sixth and vertebral line, the spots confluent above with each other; the blotches about one scale apart. The intervals between the blotches of a vivid brick red, which color, as well as the black, is sometimes seen on the bases of the adjoining scales. None of the short white lines of EH. sirtalis are visible. More or less of white on the inferior surface of the tail. No spots on end of gastrosteges.
The color when living, as described by Say, is dark-brown above, beneath bluish green, head beneath white. A vertebral greenish yellow line, and a lateral pale-yellow one; about eighty concealed red spots or semifascize on the skin and lateral margin of the scales.

<<<Page: 1101>>>

In twenty-two specimens in which the length of the tail was examined, the following results were obtained. Tour and three-quarters times in total length, 4; four and one-half times, 1; four and one-third, 2; four and one-fifth, 1; four and one-tenth, 4; four and one-twelfth, 1; four and one-fifteenth, 1; four, 3; three and seven-eighths, 1; three and _six-sevenths, 1; three and five-sixths, 1; three and six-sevenths, 1. Variations in color exist which connect the LH. s. parietalis with several other subspecies. Thus in Cat. Nos. 954 and 7798 the superior row of spots is obsolete on the posterior two-thirds of the length and the dorsal stripe is bordered by a narrow black line, thus approaching the EH. s. dorsalis. In Cat. Nos. 664 and 4775, both from Kansas, and a specimen in my private collection from Fort Harker, Kansas, the spots of the superior row are distinct, and not confluent into a band. This form differs from the LH. s. sirtalis only in having the spaces between the spots red instead of olive brown or green. Cat. No. 8374 has the same character. In some specimens from Oregon the red spaces between the spots of the inferior row are very much contracted, and in some nearly closed, with black, thus approaching most closely the form JH. s. trilineata of the Pacific
Fig. 304. coast. Finally, in four EUTAINIA SIRTALIS PARIBTALIS SAY. specimens from Califor=i. nia there are eight supe-
Fresno, California.
Cat, No. 12576, U.S.N.M. pon labials, regularly
arranged. In two of these, from San Francisco (Cat. Nos. 865, 893), the confluence of the spots of the superior row with each other and with those of the lower row is imperfect, and on the hinder part of the length nonexistent. In the others (Cat. Nos. 864, 896) the colors on the posterior half of the body are arranged as in LH. s. dorsalis, the anterior half conforming to the definition of the FH. s. parietalis.
This subspecies represents the 4. s. sirtalis in the central region of North America, which it completely replaces. It is the most abundant species of the northern parts of the Pacific region, ranging from Walla Walla to the coast, and as far south as Fresno, California. On the coast proper it is associated with three other subspecies. Its habits are semiaquatic. I have seen it in large numbers on the shores of the lakes of Oregon, where it lies in wait for frogs, toads, ete. It haunts the high grass of the creeks and rivers of the great plains, in which it quickly glides when pursued.

This is
produced by a diminution in the size of the red spots anteriorly, and their obliteration on the posterior part of the body and on the tail.

Length of tail entering the total length four and one-fifth times. The superior labials eight, the anterior rather crowded, so that it may be the normal number is seven instead of eight, in which case this form Should be referred to the LH. sirtalis rather than to the L. infernalis The loreal is as high as long, and the temporals are 1-2-3. The frontal wider than the superciliaries, and does not reach the preocular. The postgeneials are longer than the pregeneials. Gastrosteges, one hundred and fifty-eight; urosteges, sixty-eight.
Measurements.—Total length, 800 mm.; length of tail (tip lost), 118 mm.
The ground color is seen in the dorsal stripe and in the belly as high as
the third row of seales, inclusive. This is bluish olivaceous. The scales mentioned are black at their bases and on their adjacent edges, and in the first \ row of scales the black covers the angular extremity of the gastrosteges. Noregular spots on the gastrosteges, as in most subspecies of EL. sirtalis. There is no distinct lateral stripe. The dorsal stripe covers one

which also covers one and two half rows of scales, and which extends to the base of the tail. Exterior to this on each side is a red stripe, which also covers one and two half rows of scales. Exterior to this on each side is a second black stripe on each side, which covers one and a half rows of scales, and extends to the base of the tail, beyond which it is broken up into a series of black spots. It is also broken up into spots for a short distance posterior to the head. These spots have no connection with the superior black band. Head olive gray, with two pale parietal spots; no nuchal spots. Superior labials with narrow black posterior borders on the fourth, fifth, and sixth. Throat and chin yellowish, unspotted; no black marks on middle of belly and tail below.
The color pattern of this subspecies is entirely different from that of any other, and is the result of a confluence of the spots, one phase of which is seen in the #. sirtalis concinna, As in that form, the inferior row of spots has become a longitudinal band; but, unlike that form, the red spaces between the superior row of spots has also become a stripe, jnstead of remaining separate.

Head small; body rather stout. Black, with a dorsal light stripe, and the Usual two rows of lateral spots and stripe replaced by a single series of distinct salmon-colored spots.
Above, intense black, with a dorsal greenish white line one and two half seales wide, and extending from head to tip of tail. On each side is a series of vertically elongated distinct spots of a reddish salmon color, and seventy-five in number between the head and anus. They occur on the second to the sixth rows of scales, and are half a scale long, the same color being visible on the adjoining skin. The dark intervals are one scale longer than the spots themselves. Beneath, greenish black, tinged with white anteriorly. Whole head reddish yellow, tinged above with brown.
This subspecies carries the fusion of colors further than the JL. s. parietalis, since the belly is black. This color joins that of the inferior series of black spots, and as the superior series are contluent, the intervals between the former are isolated.

In this subspecies melanism is carried farther than in any of the others. The typical specimen is of an intense black, tinged with bluish below. There is avery narrow greenish white vertebral line, beginning at the nape, where it occupies one and two half scales, and gradually narrows to the carina of the middle dorsal row, becoming obsolete at the anus.

In another specimen, Cat. Ne. 5279, with the general color very dark, the vertebral line occupies one and two half scales throughout. The black on each side appears formed by the confluence above of about seventy-six spots from head to anus, each spot from one and one-half to two scales long. In other words, there is a stripe of black three and one-half scales wide on each side of the vertebral line, confluent with which is a series of black spots on each side, as indicated. The lateral stripe is on the second lateral row of scales, of a greenish white color, and confluent with the intervals of the spots, also of the same color. The stripe is not well defined, but swells and narrows like a knotted cord. Exterior row of dorsal scales and sides of abdomen deep blueblack, becoming greenish toward the middle of the abdomen; anteriorly the color shows more white. The intervals between the lateral spots are very narrow, and anteriorly are wanting, producing the coloration of the EH. s. trilineata. Scuta, 170-1-86.

Type in Museum Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.
Form moderately stout, about as in FZ. sirtalis. Tail short. Head short and broad, flattened on crown. Frontal and occipitals short and broad; superciliaries short in front; one anteorbital, much elevated and pointed above, in contact with the fronto-external angle of the frontal; — three postorbitals, the lower one lying on the fifth and sixth superior labials; upper labials eight, sixth and seventh largest; lower labials ten, sixth largest. Eye rather large, center just behind the suture between the fourth and fifth labials. A vertical series of three temporals in contact with the postorbitals, the lower one small and lying on. ‘the sixth and seventh labials. but mainly on the sixth; the middle one:

<<<Page: 1108>>>

above and behind it is much larger and elongated; the upper one, somewhat smaller than the last, is in contact with the occipitals. On one side in this specimen the large middle temporal is divided into two portions, the anterior being the smaller. Two scales in second row on both sides.
Twenty-one dorsal rows of scales, the outer one but little larger than the second, the former smooth anteriorly, faintly carinated toward the tail; carine on the remaining rows increasing toward the dorsal line.
A golden yellow stripe occupies the median row of scales from nape to tip of tail, widening slightly on the edges of the contiguous rows at the anterior end; a lateral stripe of same color very indistinct anteriorly, where it is mostly confined to the third row, but better defined on the posterior third of the body, where it invades the upper half of the seeond. Color above the laterals brownish olive with two series of alternating dark spots (sixty-six pairs in this specimen from head to anus), the lower series on the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows, the upper on the seventh, eighth, and ninth; below the lateral lines, the first and lower half of the second rows (anteriorly, occasionally to the lower half of the third) with the ends of the abdominal scutellz, are lustrous pitchblack. The upper surface of the head in frout of the occipitals is greenish olive; behind that, to the neck and the sides of the head, including the seventh and eighth superior labials, blackish brown, slightly maculated with dull chestnut just behind the occipitals, the dorsal yellow line being slightly indicated on the dark patch. Beneath white, with a creamy tinge anteriorly, becoming pale greenish on the
~subeaudals. The labials are margined with blackish brown; a post-
oral cream-colored crescent with the concave side forward; a similar band passing down on the postorbitals widens on the sixth upper labial and runs into the throat color, and a third light band is indicated on the anteorbital, becoming lost on the fourth upper labial. Iris bright copper color. Seuta, 156-163.
Measurements.~ Total length, 510 mm.; length of tail, 110 mm.
The general affinity of the species is to the F. elegans marciana, since when the epidermis is removed the spots have much the same character. It is especially characterized by the large number of temporal scales of the first row, which are more numerous thau in any other species of the genus. The contact of the preocular and frontal plates is also uncommon. The broad black lateral band is characteristic.
The only specimen known was taken near Tucson, Arizona, and was
‘sent to the zoological garden of Philadelphia by Mr. Herbert Brown.
During life it was of an aggressive disposition, like several other species of the genus. It is now in the museum of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences,

its ocular plates, having them 2-2, 2-3, 1-3, or 2-4, 2-3 being apparently the most common arrangement. The food of both these species is the Rana montezume Baird, and another species allied to R. halecina. The life of this lake is in other directions exceedingly prolific, especially in fishes and in minute Crustacea.
I am indebted to my excellent friend, Dr. Julius Flohr, of the city of Mexico, for a canoe excursion on the lake Xochimileo, which is 17 miles from the city, in the valley of Mexico. Here I had an opportunity of seeing the botany and zoology of the very irregular shores, which are so curiously constructed by the art of the natives. The shores are indented in the form of long, narrow docks, and extended in the form of piers into the waters of the lake. The ends of these piers are sometimes more or less detached below, so as to be readily moved, from which the later statements regarding the floating islands have originated. The piers are planted with crops of vegetables or flowers, which are sold in the adjacent city.
The ends and shores of the piers are the resting place of innumerable water snakes, which can be readily observed from a canoe. The wife of our Indian boatman was particularly acute in detecting these animals before either my friend or myself could see them. We caught a considerable number, and found that they belong to the two species above named. The habits of the two differ somewhat. The H. macrostemma is the more active, sooner seeking the water, where it swims, keeping close to the shore, and remaining more or less in sight until it conceals itself in a hole. The H. melanogaster, on the other hand, lies quietly so as to be more easily taken in the hand; but, if it once takes to the water, it seeks the depths and is no more seen. It is much less disposed to bite than the 7. macrostemma; the latter being, like its ally, the F. sirtalis, a very pugnacious snake.

Teeth isodont. Scales in twenty-one rows, all keeled excepting the inferior one. Superior labials eight, all low and rather long, the orbit bounded by the fourth, and cut off from the fifth by the inferior postocular. Loreal low, much longer than high. Preoculars two, both subquadrate, the superior the larger, the inferior resting on the fourth superior labial. Postoculars three, the median the smallest (the apex of the inferior cut off to form a fourth on one side). Temporals 1-3, the anterior large, bounding the sixth and seventh labials above. Rostral not prominent, wider than deep, truncate above. Internasals longer than wide, rarely separated in front, and from the rostral by a pentagonal azygous plate.

rior angles touching the superior preoculars. Superciliary plates convex, subtriangular, and nearly acute in front. Parietals elongate, posteriorly acute, and much divaricate. Muzzle quite narrow, eyes directed laterally.
Color above ash gray, with six or seven longitudinal series of brown spots. Those of the median two or three rows are sometimes united, forming short crossbars. Those of the inferior series are on the first row of scales and are blacker than the others. Below creamy ashen, with irregular black blotches on the anterior part of each seutum. Tail nearly uniform ash above and below, excepting a blackish line along the junction of the seutelle. Throat yellow; inferior labials yellow with blackish posterior borders; superior labials less bright yellow with brown posterior and superior borders. Top of head brown, with darker brown markings as follows: A dark shade in the middle of each parietal; a narrow X opening forward on the frontal; a longitudinal line on each superciliary, and a transverse waved line across each prefrontal.
The above description is taken from the _ typical specimen which I caught in the San Francisco River, which is one of the head tributaries of the Gila, in southwes:ern New Mexico. Subsequently the National
EUTNIA MULTIMACULATA COPE. Museum received numernatn aA ous specimens from near
the city of Chihuahua,
Mexico, where it is evi-
dently abundant. The specimens display a remarkable variability in coloration, and also prove that the azygous plate which exists between the prenasal plates of the typical specimen, is an abnormality. In one of the Chihuahua specimens there is an azygous plate between the internasals, which is of shorter form than in the type; while in another there is an azygous plate between the prefrontals. In all of the others azygous plates are wanting. The ocular plates are normally 3-3, but the following variations occur: 2-3—2-3, one; 2-3—3-3, one; 2-2—3-3, one. The lorealis normally quite elongate; in one specimen it is shortened. The color varies from uniform brown above, to spotted in two styles. In one of these there are seven rows of brown spots with paler or rufous centers; in the other the brown borders of the spots have disappeared, and the rusty centers are represented by small rusty orange spots. The under surfaces are yellow, the gastrosteges with

dark shading at the ends. In young specimens the head is more or less marked with obscure blackish marks. This species is distinguished by its long compressed muzzle, as well as by its peculiarities of squamation.
The only specimen of this species which I have seen living was taken in a Seine net with which I was fishing near the bank of the San Francisco River. It dove into the net, seeking the bottom of the water as a place of concealment, as is the habit of the E. melanogaster, and contrary to that of the L. saurita and E. macrostemma, which swim preferably on the surface, seeking concealment under the banks.

Rostral plate turned over on the superior face of the muzzle, and with a truncate posterior border; the transverse extent three times the length. Internasals a little longer than wide; the prefrontals decurved laterally. Nasal long and rather narrow, slightly recurved on the upper face of the muzzle in front.

rior labials; geneials elongate, the pair subequal. The head is an elongate oval, narrowed anteriorly, and quite distinct from the neck. The tail is one-fourth the total length. Scales in twenty-one longitudinal rows, all strongly keeled except the first and second on each side; all
poreless. Gastrosteges one hundred and seventy-seven; urosteges
entire, four; divided, thirty-three.
General color above light brown, olive shaded on the head. The anterior half of the body is marked with six rows of small alternating bright rufous or orange spots, each of which occupies one, and sometimes an adjoining scale. They stand on the first and second, the fifth, and on the eighth rows, respectively. On the posterior third of the length they are wanting, and are indistinct posterior to the middle of the length. The lower surfaces are pale brownish gray; the base of each gastrostege with blackish markings. Labial plates light; head without spots. There is an inferior preocular higher than long on one side of this specimen.
This species is nearly related to the FH. multimaculata, and better specimens may prove them to be identical. However, there is a constant difference in the shape of the rostral plate, which has the form usual in Hutenia in the HL. multimaculata, while it is so peculiar in the present species as to have given ground for its separation in a distinct genus. This plate is obliquely truncated laterally and produced posteriorly at the middle of the posterior border, in the L. multimaculata; while it is low and truncate posteriorly, having a transversely ovate form in the EH. rufopunctata. Its border is slightly free all round in the latter, which it is not in the former; but this appearance may be a result of drying, though I do not see exactly how it can have so arisen. This species further differs from the HL. multimaculata in the two superior labials entering the orbit; in the rather more elongate internasals and prefrontals; in the more poster.orly-produced loreal, and in the superior labials, of which the third nearly enters the orbit. However, some specimens of the H. multimaculata approach it in one or the other of these respects, and the narrowness of the labials has been somewhat exaggerated by the partial drying to which the specimen has been subjected. To the same cause may be ascribed some errors in the original figure and description. Thus the nasal plates are not confluent, nor does the loreal plate quite enter the orbit as has been stated.' The figure omits the postocular plates, which were simply turned into the orbit by drying. The rostral plate is accurately represented.

This superfamily presents no such diversity of character as to indicate that if embraces more than one family, the Dipsadidz. The subfamilies of the Dipsadidz correspond quite closely with those of the Colubride. They are defined as follows:

These subfamilies correspond with those of the Colubride, as follows:
Colubride. Dipsadidee. Xenodontine. Erythrolamprine. Dromicine. Scytaline. Colubrine. Dipsadine. Lycodontine. Homalopsine.
The distribution of the subfamilies of corresponding pairs is nearly identical. Thus the first two of both columns are South American, and the third of both columns is nearly cosmopolitan. The fourth group of each column is nearly restricted to the African and Oriental regions. Still closer correspondences will be pointed out in the characters of some of the genera of corresponding subfamilies.
In this subfamily the sulcus and hemipenis are bifureate in the known genera.

The groups into which this subfamily is divided correspond closely with those which are found in the subfamily Dromicine. Group VI, including only the genus Heterodon, is the only one of the latter which is not represented in the former. Apart from penial characters, the genera of the corresponding groups sometimes resemble each other, but frequently they do not. Thus, Alsophis resembles Philodryas, and Rhadinea resembles Coniophanes, and Acanthophallus resembles Tomodon, in general characters.
This subfamily is exclusively neotropical, with the exception that four species of the Central American subregion wander over the border into the Toltecan subregion, one of them extending to within the political boundaries of the United States at its extreme southern limit.

This genus is allied to Tomodon Duméril and Bibron, but the pupil in that genus is round and the scales have apical pits. As all my specimens are females, I have been unable to learn the penial characters. But one species of Manolepis is certainly known, but discrepancies in the figures and descriptions of authors leave the question somewhat uncertain. The characters are briefly as follows:

Supraoculars broad; occipitals rather short; longer than broad, the length equal that of the frontal; two unequal postoculars in contact with one temporal. One preocular just touching frontal; one longitudinal loreal, higher behind, frequently wanting. One elongate nasal, the nostril anterior to its middle and frequently connected by a suture to the margin below. Superior labials, eight; third, fourth, and fifth entering orbit; inferior, ten; five in contact with pregenials, which are longer than postgenials. Anterior maxillary and mandibular teeth longer than median. Pupil round. Scales broad, thin, poreless, in nineteen rows. ‘Tail rather slender. Gastrosteges, 173-9'; one divided anal; urosteges, 69-73.
Measurements.—End of muzzle to rictus oris, 13 mm.; total length, 582 mm.; tail, 112 mm.
General color light brown, punctulate with dark brown, especially thickly on head and sides. A darker brown band three and two half seales wide, from occiput to end of tail, which is nearly broken into spots on the nape. Ends of scuta and first two rows of scales darker, especially anteriorly where the band is sooty and spreads over the lips and chin; a faint longitudinal band above the shade; a short yellow, dark bordered streak from postorbitals to penultimatelabial. Abdomen with many short punctulate streaks. With age the bands become more indistinct, so that nothing remains of the one on the dorsal region but its external borders.
Of the seven specimens at my disposal three have a loreal plate and four have none, its place being taken by the decurved prefrontal. In one specimen there are eight superior labials, the excess appearing in front of the line of the orbit.
In all of my specimens the frontal plate is relatively narrower than in the specimens figured by Jan, and described by Boulenger. Its least width enters the length from three to four times, while those authors give it as entering two and a half times.

columbian region, although the specimens in the U.S. National Museum are from the Tierra Caliente.
Sumichrast says of this species:
This serpent is peculiar to western Mexico. It is not common and is found especially in sandy regions, sometimes in the interior of the forest, sometimes on the borders of streams, Its extreme agility renders its capture difficult. Without being aquatic, it has the manners of the Tropidonoti, with which one is inclined toconfound it on first sight, if the retrousé muzzle did not give it an entirely peculiar expression. =
I would addthat the black color round the mouth and chin adds to its decidedly suspicious physiognomy.
There is some doubt as to the correct name of this species. The description of Jan in 1863 is scarcely sufficient to sustain his name, and in 1862 I described a species as Liophis putnamii—a species which belongs to the genus Dromicus. It was not, however, called Dromicus putnamii until after 1863.

Elongated grooved tooth separated from others by an interspace. Hemipenis bifurcate, apex with a few calyces, between which and the spinous portion it is flounced.

This genus holds a rather isolated position among American genera, but itis quite similar to and probably allied to the genus khamphiophis Peters, which inhabits the sandy parts of Africa. Both genera have the decurved muzzle and claw-like rostral plate, which is designed for scooping a cavity in the soil by a downward movement, as opposed to the upward movement usual in other snakes.

Conophis sumichrastii Corr, Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1875, p. 137. While this form resembles the typical subspecies in coloration, the form of the head and of its plates differs considerably. The muzzle is narrower, so that the prefrontals have a relatively greater anteroposterior extent. The greater relative elongation is seen in the frontal plate as shown in the diagnosis, an elongation in which the supraoculars

This genus is restricted to Central America and the adjacent parts of the Columbian region, since a species (C. dromiciformis) is found on the Pacific slope of the Andes, near the equator. The remaining nine species belong to Central America and Mexico, and one of them has been taken in the United States, on the lower Rio Grande. The typical species are brown or red, with black stripes, and are of delicate and handsome tints. Another pattern is seen in the H. lateritius Cope, of western Mexico, which is a red species, with black head and neck. The species known to me are characterized as follows:

Size rather small; scales in nineteen longitudinal rows, thin, elongate, obtuse. Head scarcely distinct, short profile of muzzle not elevated. Anterior plates of the head small; loreal a little longer than high; one preocular, two postoculars. Superior labials seven, third and fourth entering the orbit. Vertical plate elongate, lateral borders convergent, posterior angle acute. Occipitals long. Inferior labials nine; geneials two pairs, nearly equal. Gastrosteges 118-130, anal divided; urosteges 82.
Measurements.—Length of tail, 133 mm.; total length, 362 mm. The stump of the tail appears tetragonal in section. Coloration above, light brown, every scale densely punctulated with darker, especially near the margins. From the first to the fourth row of scales this is deeper, giving the sides adarker shade. The vertebral row of scales from the occipitals to the end of the tail is also darker. Top of the head densely and obscurely vermiculated and punctulated. The dark shade on the fourth row of scales becomes a band anteriorly, and is bordered above and below with white on the neck. The lower white border is discontinued on the neck, but reappears as a spot three scales back of the occipitals. Inferior half of rostral, upper and lower labials, chin, throat, and belly light brownish yellow, densely punctulated with brown. Each labial with a darker spot in the center. Fewer punctulations on the urosteges.
This form differs from the typical C. imperialis not only in its very narrow dorsal stripe, but normally has only seven superior labials. This character is, however, inconstant, and it is probably best to look upon the form as a subspecies of the C. imperialis.

The whole body is bright vermillion, punctulated with brown, passing through orange to golden on the belly. The head and neck for ten scales posteriorly is black, the labials bordered and traversed by yellow lines, and the occipitals dotted with the same. Throat and chin yellow; black spotted. The head is broad posteriorly and the outline converged rapidly to the acute prominent muzzle. Loreal square, one preocular, two postoculars; seven upper labials; eye over third and fourth; fifth very large. Ten inferior labials; scales in nineteen rows. Vertical plate nearly as broad as long. Anal divided.
Measurements.—Total length, 606 mm. Of this the tail is 175 mm. in length.
But one example of this handsome species has come under my observation. According to Boulenger the Tachymenis melanocephala is the same. Peters describes his specimen as follows:
It was founded on a young specimen ‘‘ which possibly belongs to T. bipunctatus, Giinther, with which it agrees in respect to its pholidosis, and in the punctulation of the head shields and the markings on the infralabials. The ground color of the head, including the nape, to the tenth row of scales posteriorly, is blackish brown, behind which there is a yellowish collar around the neck four scales wide, while the
remainder of the body is yellowish brown above; the underside yellowish, without black punctulations.”

TRIMORPHODON Cope. Trimorphodon Corr, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1861, p. 297; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 32, 1887, p. 68.
Posterior maxillary tooth elongate, grooved; anterior teeth of both jaws elongate; intermediate teeth of the maxillary series shorter. Head plates normal; two nasals; two loreals, one in front of the other. Pupil vertical. Head very distinct. Scales smooth, subequal. Anal scutum divided; subcaudal scuta in two series.
This genus includes species which inhabit Central America, Mexico, and the adjacent parts of the United States. It is allied to Sibon, from which the elongate anterior teeth and the divided anal scuta distinguish it. No species of Sibon is known to possess two loreals, one anterior to the other. The species of Trimorphodon, with their wide triangular head, narrow neck, and slitlike pupil, considerably resemble venomous snakes, which their pugnacious disposition does not diminish. They differ as follows:

Scales in twenty-one (in some specimens, for a short distance, in twentythree) rows rather broad posteriorly and upon the middle of the body, not larger upon the vertebral line. The body anteriorly is slender, contracting toasmallneck. Tail less than one-sixth of the total length. Head very distinct, the temples much swollen, so that the greatest

anterior. Side of the head constricted at the orbits, the muzzle rather narrow and truncate. Rostral plate broader than high, with but four sutural borders, the superior very long; the apex apparent upon the surface of the head. Prefrontals much broader than long; one-third the size of that part of the prefrontals visible from above. Upon a vertical view, the postfrontals appear longer than broad. Occipitals, superciliaries, and vertical developed; the last presenting a right angle posteriorly, and having the lateral borders slightly concave and converging; the first not longer, and about as wide as long, in contact with a large scale in their posterior, common emargination. Nasal plates distinctly divided, very small, higher than long. Loreal plates two, the anterior higher than long, intercalated superiorly between the prefrontal and postfrontal, posterior as long as high. Preocculars three, the © superior largest, not in contact with the vertical; the inferior bounded anteriorly by the third upper labial. Postoculars three, the inferior a

little the largest. Superior labials nine, fourth and fifth entering the orbit, sixth largest, higher than broad. Inferior labials twelve, the third and fourth narrow, and much produced posteriorly. Geneials two pairs, the anterior longest. Gastrosteges, 236; one divided anal; urosteges, 70.
Measurements.—Total length, 696 mm.; tail, 108 mm.
Seven teeth upon the superior maxillary bone, of which one posterior is elongate and grooved, three central, small and recurved, and three anterior, very long, the first longest and least recurved. The central three are not separated from those anterior and posterior to them by spaces wider than those existing between themselves. Palatine teeth six, the anterior three the longest, all longer than the pterygoids. The three anterior mandibular teeth longer and more widely spaced than the posterior, having an outward direction as in Hormonotus Hallowell.
The ground color is a light gray. The muzzle is crossed by an indistinct ashy band, which extends upon the anterior part of the postfrontals. The posterior half of these plates is involved in a deep brown band, which crosses the head between the eyes, and whose posterior border is very concave, extending upon the superciliaries to the vertical plane of the pupil of the eye. This band is continued posteriorly upon the inferior postocular and sixth upper labial. A pair of broad diverging bands begins one band on either side of the center of the vertical, crosses the superciliary and occipital shields, and following the expanded outline of the temporal and tympanic regions, contracts and becomes longitudinal and parallel upon the neck. A brown spot upon the posterior extremity of the vertical plates with a posterior elongation, completes the resemblance of this figure to a lyre, or still more to that musical (?) instrument known to children as the “Jew’s-harp.” The ground color appears upon the vertex as an anchor-shaped figure, and on the cheek as an oblique band. The back, as far as the anus, is ornamented with twenty-one pairs of deep brown spots, their gemination only apparent anteriorly by the punctulate character of the scales in intervals between the pairs. These intervals are always about three scales wide, the lesser, two and a half anteriorly, one and a half posteriorly. Dorsal spots seven scales wide; as the scales are broader posteriorly, the spots are also. There is an irregular series of lateral spots, one opposite each of the intervals, sometimes confluent with the dorsal spots; anteriorly they form a very narrow broken band. Another series of spots involves the tips of pairs of the gastrosteges, which are separated by two, three, four, or even five immaculate ones. Ten confluent pairs of spots on the upper surface of the tail. Whole under surface whitish.
This species is most nearly allied to the 7. lambda Cope. From this one it will be always distinguished by the two parallel stripes on the neck, which extend to the superciliary plates. Sometimes (Cat. No. 8760) the stripes do not connect with the superciliary stripes and join on the parietal plates.

<<<Page: 1127>>>

. This species presents, in several of the specimens examined, the peculiarity of having an even number of rows of scales—twenty.

Parietals narrowed posteriorly. Inferior labials eleven, the fifth in contact with pregeneials, and none in contact with postgeneials. Postgeneials much shorter than pregeneials. Guastrosteges, 231; anal, 1-1; urosteges, 77. The body is compressed, and the head is very distinct.
Measurements.—Total length, 272 mm.; tail, 45 mm.; head to rictus oris, 9.2 mm.
General color, gray; the back is crossed by narrow black cross bands at rather remote intervals. These bands are pale bordered and narrow to an apex below, which is above the gastrosteges. They become narrower posteriorly, and on the tail form half-rings. On the extremity of

every third or fourth gastrostege there is a small black spot throughout the length to the tail. There is a larger black spot on the sides between the extremities of a few of the cross bands. The superior bor-
der of the sixth and the adjacent part of the fifth superior labial is |
black. On the top of the head are three large round black spots; one is on the center of the frontal and one is on the anterior part of each parietal. No cross bands on the muzzle. The dark cross bands are only two scales wide on the posterior part of the body; on the anterior part they are three or four scales wide. The interspaces vary from twelve anteriorly to seven posteriorly.
One specimen, Cat. No. 14268, was sent from near the city of Chihuahua by Mr. Edward Wilkinson to the U.S. National Museum. This species is nearest the 7. biscutatus Duméril and Bibron in squamation, but differs greatly in coloration from this or any other species of the genus.

Pupilvertical. Hemipenis undivided with bifurcate sulcus spermaticus, and numerous spines below and calyces above. The latter present a free margin to the superior spinous region, that is, the organ is capitate.
This genus has near allies among the Dipsadine group, to which it belongs. From Dipsas it is distinguished by the divided preanal plate; from Himantodes by the double scale-pits, that genus having but one. From Trimorphodon it differs in the equality of the ungrooved maxillary teeth and the single loreal plate. The greater number of species of this genus are Mexican and Central American, one species (S. annulatum) extending its range throughout tropical South America. One species only has been found on the Rio Grande River, and extends within our borders. The species are closely allied and are subject to some variation. One only (S. rhombiferum Giinther) I have not seen, and I give its characters on the authority of Giinther. All the species known have but one temporal plate in the first row.
In some of the forms the head is less distinct posteriorly than is characteristic of the typical genera of this subfamily, giving a coronelline form and forming a transition to the more fusiform types.
The S. annulatum is the only species which ranges over Brazil; the others are all Central American (= Mexican).

SCOLECOPHIS Cope.
Scolecophis Copk, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, p. 259; 1861, p. 74.—BocourRT, Miss. Sci. Mex., Rept., 1883, p.577.—BOULENGER, Cat. Snakes Brit. Mus., III, 1896, p. 210.
Platycranion JAN, Elenco Sist. Ofid., 1863, p. 40.
Cephalic plates normal; a loreal. Anal plates divided.
Two species of this genus are known from the Central American region of the neotropical realm. These are the S. atrocinctus Schlegel, of the strictly Central American countries, and the S. michoacanensis! Duges, of Mexico proper. To these Boulenger adds my species, Procinura ceemula, which I referred to a distinct genus on account of the tubercular carination of the robust tail. This is very different from the characteristic of the other species, where the tail is smooth and slender. However, the value of this character may be for the present problematical, so I provisionally follow the Catalogue of the British Museum.

above, presenting an obtuse angle posteriorly. Top of head flat. Prefrontals much wider than long, their external canthal border equal to that of the internasals. Frontal wide, sending along angle backward. Parietals short, wide; temporals 1-2, the first small, as deep as long. Superior labials seven, all except the first deeper than long, the third and fourth entering the orbit. Preorbital vertical, narrow, not reaching frontal; postorbitals two, equal and small. Loreal quadrangular. Inferior labials eight, fourth largest; pregeneials three times as long as postgeneials and separated from gastrosteges by six rows of scales. The dorsal carine first appear on the twenty-second transverse row of scales anterior to the vent, and occupy the median nine series. Al the

caudal series are keeled, and as they are wider than long, the free apices of the keel, projecting, give them a depressed pyramidal form. Gastrosteges, 148; urosteges, 41.
In the coloration of the body this species is an almost exact repetition of the Elaps fulvius. It is surrounded by wide black rings, which are broadly bordered with yellow and separated by red interspaces of twice their width. The scales of the red spaces have each a central black spot, which is more distinct than in EH. fulvius, on the anterior part of the body, above the sides; posteriorly they are weaker. The black annuli pass round the belly, but are all somewhat broken anteriorly. Between them the gastrosteges have black shades. The coloration of the head differs from that of the H. fulvius in having merely a large black spot covering the parietal, superciliary, and frontal plates, and extending round the eye, but not reaching the edge of the lip. Muzzle and chin unspotted.
Measurements.—Total length, 364 mm.; length of rictus oris, 11 mm.; length of tail, 61 mm. .
Although this curious and handsome serpent so much resembles the Elaps fulvius, it is not yet known that the two species inhabit the same region.
This species is near to Scolecophis atrocinctus, but the peculiar tubercular carination of the tail distinguishes it. It inhabits a rocky, mountainous region, and I have little doubt that this peculiar character enables the animal to force itself into the earth or beneath stones. The tail is used as a fulcrum in pushing against rough and resistant bodies.

The geographical distribution of these genera is East Indian.
The habit of the subfamily is aquatic, and it embraces the fresh-water snakes of all countries. Many of the East Indian forms are partially marine, living in tide water or on the coast,.as Homalopsis, Cerberus, etc. Hipistes imitates in its appearance the sea snakes, and is often taken with them, and with eels, in their nets by the Malay fishermen. Herpeton inhabits the Cambodia and other rivers of Farther India, and has a vegetable diet. Most of the other aquatic genera are piscivorus.
I have been able to examine a limited number of species of this superfamily, and must therefore present an imperfect synopsis of the genera. I have examined enough of the species to affirm that they present variations of type similar to those seen among the superfamilies already considered. All the forms that I have seen have a bifurcate sulcus and all are spinous.

It is to be observed that much the largest number of genera belong to the Australian realm. The majority of the species belong alsé to Australia, the genus Denisonia alone including some nineteen species. The genus Ogmodon with one species belongs to the Fiji Islands only. No genus or species occurs in the Western Hemisphere, where they are represented by the Elapidz.
The Najide, aithough of an organization inferior to that of the Solenoglypha, embraces some of the most venomous snakes known to us. Such are the species of Ophiophagus, Naja, and Bungarus,in India, and Acanthophis and Pseudechisin Australia. The cobra (Naja tripudians Linneus) causes more deaths than any other snake, not only because of the energy of its venom, but because of its courage and activity. In Australia the Pseudechis porphyriacus (the black snake) causes more fatalities than any other. The death adder (Acanthophis antarctica) is a dangerous species, but it is less active in its movements. The Ophiophagus elaps of India is the longest venomous snake, reaching a length of 12 feet. It is fortunately rare. Many of the smaller Australian Najide are not dangerous.
The only genera of this family which I have examined are EHlaps and Vermicella. The hemipenis is alike in both; that is, it is bifureate, with each half with a spinous apex. The extension of the spines downward differs with the species. Thus they extend but a short way in Hlaps corallinus, but extend far down in in H. surinamensis and HL. imperator. The usual definitions of the genera are as follows:

This genus embraces from twenty to thirty species of the neotropical realm, three of which have their principal habitat in the southern portions of the nearctic. They are of rather elongate body and short tail, and have small eyes. They approximate in general appearance the Calamarine Colubrid, so that their discrimination, except on examination of the dentition, from snakes of this group can only be accomplished by experts in species characters. The scutellation of the head is exactly that of the genus Tantilla. The coloration is brilliant, consisting of red and black, with less yellow, arranged in rings or parts of rings. The red is generally the ground color, and the black rings are either single or in sets of three. The latter may be much narrower than the ground color, or may be so wide as to reduce it to very small proportions (f. semipartitus, HE. imperator). The epidermis is beautifully iridescent, especially on the black spaces. The colors are much like those of the mineral labradorite, and are probably due to a similar physical cause, namely, a microscopic lamination of the surface. On direct and antero-posterior views the color is peacock purple; on transverse views it passes from brassy yellow through brassy green to maroon and brown. ‘The colors do not appear if the scales are wet.
The bite of some of the larger species, as EH. surinamensis and E, marcgravii, is said to be dangerous, but that of the smaller ones is innocuous to man and the larger animals.
Three species are found within the limits of the nearctic realm, which differ as follows:
{. Temporal seales, 1-1; a black ring immediately behind head; internasals much smaller than prefrontals.

The red may be considered as the ground color of the body, though the black rings occupy nearly as much space above as the red, so as to give the general appearance of a succession of red and black rings. The yellow is intermediate. The anterior part of the head from the posterior point of the vertical plate, embracing the orbits, is black, as is also the tip of the lower jaw. <A yellow ring passes across the occipital region down to the inferior surface of the head, embracing the space between the posterior rim of the eye and the angle of the mouth. Then comes a black ring, covering eight dorsal scales, margined posteriorly with yellow. From this region to the origin of the tail the

black and red rings, from fourteen to nineteen in number each, alternate, being separated from each other by a narrow band of yellow. The black rings cover seven entire scales and two halves, the intermediate red Space five entire scales and two halves, and the yellow either one and two half-scales or two halves only. Some red spaces nay occasionally cover nine and ten seales. The tail is alternately black and yellow; the first caudal ring is black, and embraces ten scales; the second is yellow, and covers three scales. Two black and two yellow succeed and cover the same ground. The tip of the tail is black on five seales, The tip may be either black or yellow, for, according to the size, there are either three or four black rings. Underneath, the colors are the same, but dull; occasionally one or more black rings may not surround the body. The reddish spaces are irregularly blotched with deep black, as also sometimes on the upper surface.
Specimens from western Texas (Indianola on the Gulf of Mexico and the Pecos River on the north) differ somewhat from those from farther east, and furnished the bases for the Supposed species EF. tener Baird and Girard. Generally the frontal plate is not wider than the superciliary, but in one specimen it is as wide as in the typical form (Cat. No. 8574).

Dr. Einar Leennberg writes of this species as he observed it in Florida as follows: '
This is the only species of Elaps I have found in south Florida, where it is rather common. It is known under several names, as ‘‘coral snake,” ‘‘American cobra,” “‘oarter snake,” and “candy stick.” It is perhaps the most dangerous snake in Florida, because it is not somuch dreaded as the big rattlesnake or moccasin, though beiug quite as poisonous. As the last mentioned names show, it is regarded as a “pretty little snake.”” lew people know or believe that it is poisonous, it looks so harmless, and as a consequence they catch it and handle it rather roughly; the snake gets angry, bites, and a human life is endangered. I know personally of such a case. A Swede at Oakland, Orange County, found an Elaps, and because of its beautiful color he caught it and tried to put it into a bottle of aleohol. ‘The snake bit him, but the wound was not large, and as it did not swell he did not care much about it at first. After a while he was taken very sick, went to bed, asked for a physician, and drank whisky; but it was then too late. He died the next morning, about twelve hours after the snake had bitten him. During the last hours he was unconscious, but before that he suffered most excruciating pains. I have heard of several other cases of boys dying from an Elaps bite.
In other cases people have been bitten by an Llaps fulvius without suffering from it in any way, but I suppose that in such cases the Elaps had not been able to inject any poison into the wound, as it has a rather small mouth. However that may be, I can not agree with Cope that the bite “of the smaller ones (meaning smaller species of Klaps) is innocuous to man and the larger animals.” It is to be observed that the Elaps bites differentiy from the Crotalids and Viperids. The latter snake throws its head forward in striking, and draws it back again immediately. The Llaps fulvius I have seen and heard about have acted in an entirely different manner. The poor Swede above mentioned had to pull the snake from the wound, and other specimens that I had induced to bite into sticks kept the stick in the mouth for a good while. This habit probably signifies an intention to press as much poison as possible into the wound, which makes the snake the more dangerous. Elaps fulvius is, however, a good-natured snake, and it does not bite unless it is very much provoked. If not handled too roughly, an Ejlaps may be allowed to crawl on one’s hands from one to the other. I have allowed it myselt once, but I hardly think I would do it over again, and would not advise anybody else to try it.
Thave found Elaps fulvius under logs, and digging in the ground as well as erawling about on the surface, but I think it prefers dry land.
The largest specimen I have seen was from Oakland, Orange County, and measured exactly 1 m. from the tip of the nose to the anus, and the tail was90 mm. This big specimen had fourteen black rings on the body and three on the tail. Other specimens have but twelve black rings on the body and three on the tail, but one of these has four on the tail. The yellow rings cover from one to two rows of scales.

times in the total in Cat. No. 8265). Dorsal scales small. Plates of the head generally larger than in EF. euryxranthus; rostral broad and not as high as in the same. Internasals rather small, and slightly elongated laterally; prefrontals large, pentagonal, as broad as long. Superciliaries quadrangular, elongated, narrow. Frontal pentagonal, rather large, but narrow, the pointed posterior extremity inserted between the occipitals, as in HL. fulvius.
The ground color of the body in the alcoholic specimen is reddish brown, probably brighter red in life, with twelve to fourteen very narrow, black rings from head to anus. At the edges of the black rings the reddish color becomes indistinctly lighter for haifa scale, but there is no well-defined light ring bordering the black as in the other species. On the tail are five to seven broad black bands separated by narrow light rings. The anterior part of the head back to the middle of the occipitals and the upper jaw to the fourth labial is black, but this color does not extend on the lower jaw at all, and the lower edge of the rostral and upper labials is light. On the posterior part of the head is

the usual light rings, but situated farther back than in EZ. fulvius, its anterior border passing across the middle of the occipitals a little beliind the vertical, and thence down and forward to the fourth labial, expanding below upon the whole of the lower jaw. On the neck, behind this light ring, is a black one, about five or six scales in width, which does not run entirely around the body, being interrupted for a short distance on the abdomen. Behind this the black annulations are perfect, each four or five scales in width, and separated by intervals of fifteen to twenty scales of the ground color. The black annulations are broader on the vertebral region than laterally and beneath, where
they cover three or four dorsal scales and the same number of abdomi-.
nal scutelle. The black rings on the tail are about eight scales wide, and separated by light intervals of only two or three scales.
The narrow black rings, separated by very wide intervals, will at once distinguish this species from any of the others here described. There are also no blotches or dots of black on the red intervals, and if the colors of the specimen described have not been much altered by soaking, the absence of distinct light rings of a third color between

<<<Page: 1148>>>

sad, +
the black and red ones will form a striking character. The color of the light occipital ring and of the light rings on the tail is probably yellow or white in life.
The characters which distinguish this species from the Elaps fulvius are those of color only, as in structural characters the two are identical. Many of the species of the genus differ in such characters only, and they are often very constant. The present species displays equal constancy in the known individuals.

The forepart of the head is black, but the black, instead of passing forward from the anterior part of the occipitals to near the eye and thus leaving the three posterior labials yellow, as in HL. fulvius and L. distans, involves nearly the whole of the occipitals and passes backward entirely behind the angle of the mouth, and involves the whole of the lower jaw to behind the posterior labial, leaving a broad emargination in the black on the occiput, in the bottom of which emargination are seen the white posterior tips of the occipitals. Behind this is a creamy-white ring (probably yellow in life), which is situated more posteriorly than in H. fulvius, and involves only the posterior tip of the occipitals and none of the labials. Next behind this white ring, instead of a black ring as in the other species, is a broad light-brick red one involving eleven scales. A creamy-white ring three and a half scales wide separates this first red ring from a black one eight scales in width. Behind this are alternate immaculate black and red rings seven or eight scales wide, and separated by white rings three to three and a half sca es in width. There are eleven black and eleven red rings on the body separated by twice as many white ones. The tail is ringed with black and white, without any red. All the rings run entirely around the body of the same color, and are wholly without spots above and below. The plates of the head and peculiar style of coloration in this strongly marked species can not be mistaken. The three colors, each immaculate, glossy, and clear, form a striking contrast, and the red is probably bright carmine in life, thus affording the most beautiful coloration possessed by any North American snake.
The proportions of the head plates in this species are very different from what is observed in FE. fulvius and other species, and mark it as one of the most distinct species of the genus. Its geographic range is the Sonoran region, beyond which it has not been found.

The species of this family are aquatic and marine in habitat, and they are found in the seas bounding the Paleotropical and Australian realms. One species—the Hydrus bicolor—extends its range across the Pacific Ocean and to the coasts of South and Central America, extending as far south as Peru and north to Mazatlan, Mexico. It has not been yet found on the coasts of the United States. Admiral McCauley, U.S. N., informs me that he has sailed through shoals of sea snakes, probably Hydrus bicolor, off the coast of Peru. The genus Hydrophis is represented by a cousiderable number of species, while those of the other genera are less numerous. They are mostly dangerous to men who venture into the water which they inhabit. The species of Platurus are more terrestrial in their habits and are sometimes found far from the coast. The other species only leave the water to deposit
their eggs.

The only species in which tbe hemipenis is known is the Atractaspis corpulentus Hallowell. Here the sulcus and entire organ are furcate. and spinous to near the extremity. The latter is furnished with wrinkled Jamin which inclose a few irregular calyces at the apex, and below these are transverse farthest from the sulcus, and longitudinal nearest to it. The spines are in longitudinal series. The only species examined (Bb. corpulentum Hallowell) is not deeply bifureate, and the bifurcation of the sulcus corresponds with that of the organ.
Several species of Atractaspis are known from Africa. They are ground snakes of small and medium size and of dark colors. They have the form of some Calamarian genera, with indistinct head and tail and sinall eyes. They are not reported to be dangerous.

The characters are in general like those of the typical Solenoglypha.
The genera of Causidie are Ethiopian, except Azemiophis, which is Indian, but has not been found out of Farther India. There are three species of Causus, and one each of the other genera. The African genera are Yenodon-like in form, and of terrestrial habits, and the species of Causus are generally distributed in Africa. None of the species of the family reach a large size.

Tam unacquainted with the penial structure of the last two genera. The Viperidie are restricted to the Old World; that is, to the Palearctic, Paleotropical, and Ethiopian regions. The genera are distributed as follows:
Palearctic. Paleotropical. Ethiopian.

The genera Vipera and Cerastes approach close to the confines of the Paleotropical in western Asia. Africa has the greatest number and the most formidable species. The best known are the puff adder, bitis arietans, and the rhinoceros vipers, Clotho rhinoceros and C, nasicornis,
These are large and brightly-colored snakes, of most dangerous char-
acter. The two Indian species are even better known for the fatalities they occasion. These are the Daboia russellii, or Ticpolonga, and the Echis carinata, or Krait. The Daboia is a robust snake of medium size, handsomely ornamented with a pattern of large spots in brown and yellow. The Krait is a very small snake of alight brown, with pale spots and delicate lines marking the keels of the seales on the back. By reason of its small size it is easily overlooked, and as it is extremely venomous, it causes many deaths in India. It makes a scraping or rustling noise by folding itself and rubbing the scales of its body

together. The species of Cerastes are mostly dwellers in the deserts of Africa, Arabia, and Persia, and, like other desert forms, they are of pale colors. They have also horny processes, chiefly from the superciliary region, agreeing in this respect also with the spiny character of many desert reptiles and plants. The species of Cerastes are of small size, and are very poisonous. The species of Vipera are not numerous, and are distributed in Europe and western and northern Asia. The V, berus Linneus is the common viper of northern Europe, and the V. aspis is the asp of Mediterranean countries. The V. ammodytes, or sand viper, of the latter region has a considerable production of the rostral plate, so as to simulate a tactile organ.
The African tree vipers belong to the genus Atheris. They are of rather small size and of bright green and yellow colors, so as to be readily concealed in foilage. Their tails are especially prehensile, like those of the Boide. Four species are known.
In the Crotalidie we have the highest efficiency of the venom apparatus, and therefore the most specialized type of snake structure. The species are predominatingly American, but a number are found in the Paleotropical region, a distribution which is almost unparalleled among vertebrates. The genera are distributed as follows. None are found in the Australian or Ethiopian realms:
Paleotropical. Palearctic. Nearctic. Neotropical. Ethiopian. Hachesis 22. see | Ee Pa ere Se ny ee SoA Re Daten ee a | Bachasisueccsesces \edalch +e ott Peltopelorm seceesces Se tea: teens Wile ea te RES cee Bothriopsis......(ooo)... ae

Of the above genera, Lachesis embraces the larger number of species, and they oecur in the Neotropical region everywhere, as well as in India and Indo-Malaysia. Two especially dangerous species occur in America—the ZL. atrox, of the mainland, and the ZL. lanceolatus (Fer de Lance) of some of the southern islands of the West Indies. Some of the species are more or less arboreal, as L. bicolor, of Brazil, and are of green colors, while those which live on the ground are of brown hues. The Indian species are largely green in coloration. In Ophryacus and Teleuraspis we have species with tegumentary processes above the eyes.
The Teleuraspis schlegelii of Central America is an arboreal form, which is often found wound around the stems in the center of banana bunches. In handling the bunches men are frequently fatally bitten. The species of Bothriéchis are also arboreal, and those of Bothriopsis

<<<Page: 1154>>>

are terrestrial. Lachesis includes a few species of large size, and the caudal apex is much produced in anticipation of the rattle of the true rattlesnakes. In Ancistrodon we have robust species of the ground, the A. piscivorus being, however, largely aquatic in habit. It is one of the largest of the family. Sistrwrus includes a few rather small species, which prepare the way for the true rattlesnakes. The latter are principally abundant in species in North America and northern Mexico. The heaviest of all venomous snakes is the Crotalus adamanteus of the southern regions of North America, which attains a length of 8 feet. Its bite is generally fatal. Other large and dangerous species are the C. molossus of the United States and Mexican boundary region, and the C. durissus, which inhabits the warmer regions of the Neotropical realm.

Nine symmetrical plates on top of the head, the superciliary bound. ing the orbit above. Nasal plates, two. Scales keeled, bifossate. Anal plate and caudal scuta undivided. No rattle. Body and tail cylindric.
Three species of this genus are known, two of which belong to the Nearctic and one to the northern part of the Neotropical realm. They are snakes of robust habit and their bite is highly dangerous. One is terrestrial in habit and the other semiaquatic. They differ as follows: I. No loreal; two small plates behind the parietals; eye resting on labials.

Baird and Girard have proposed to separate the A. piscivorus as type of a genus Toxicophis, on account of the presence of a pair of postparietal scuta and the absence of loreal. The A. bilineatus is, however, intermediate between that species and the A. contortrix in having traces of the postparietals and a loreal plate.
Several characters are common to the species of Ancistrodon, which are also found in other genera of Crotalidz. Asin all genera with scuta on the top of the head, the superior plane of the muzzle makes a right angle with the sides, forming a strong canthus rostralis, which is continued around the apex of the rostral plate. The fossie of the epidermal scales are situated farther back than in the genera of the harmless snakes, and a small tuberosity of the true scale fits into each of them. There are frequently several divided urosteges near the end of the tail, but their number is irregular, and they are sometimes absent, as in Ancistrodon contortrix, Cat. No. 10361. The last of the caudal vertebree consists of an osseous splint with acute apex, which is ensheathed in three modified scales, two above and one below, which is better developed than in most harmless snakes. This process is thrown into rapid vibration when its possessor is alarmed, and produces a buzzing sound when among dry leaves or other objects. It foreshadows the rattle of the Crotali. It is especially developed in the Neotropical genus Lachesis. It is variable in size in the Ancistrodons.

No superior loreal. Inferior wall of orbit bounded by third labial; twenty-tive dorsal rows of scales. Dark chestnut-brown, with indistinct vertical dark bars. Line from superciliary along the edge of the head through the middle of the temporal scales. A second line, from the lowest point of the orbit, parallel to the first, across the superior labial plates.
Seales all wide and strongly keeled, including those on the sides and back of head, except the inferior row of temporals, which are smooth. First row of dorsal scales with weaker keels than other 1ows. Two nasal plates with the nostrils between them, the anterior deeper, the posterior longer. Internasals two, one above the other; the upper extending from the eye to the posterior nasal, the lower linear and forming the upper wall of the pit. Lower and posterior wall of pit constituted by a narrow plate (inferior loreal) resting along the third labial and terminating on the second. Second superior labial elevated, forming the anterior border of the maxillary fossa and of its superior anterior angle, the largest narrowing upward, and third labial constituting the inferior wall of the orbit, of which three seales form the posterior wall. Upper labials eight, large and broad; the first and eighth longer than high, the others higher than long; lower labials eleven, fifth largest; seventh to tenth deeper than long. Postgeneials much shorter than pregeneials, separated by two scales. Parietals sueceeded each by a triangular plate, which is rather smaller than an internasal. Temporals 6-5, 5-4, 6-5, the inferior row much the largest.
General color dark chestnut brown, with darker markings. Head above, purplish black. An obsolete chestnut-brown streak passes from the posterior end of the superciliary along the upper edge of the head through the middle of the second row of supralabial seales. A narrow yellowish-white line passes from the third labial, or begins just below the lowest part of the orbit, and passes backward parallel with the first stripe on the side of the neck, where it is confluent with the yellowish white of the throat. On the lower labials are three short, nearly vertical light bars on the fourth, sixth, and seventh; the rest of the jaw itself, as well as the interval between the stripes on the sides

In some specimens from western Texas the superior labial plates have a slight anterior position at the expense of the second, which is somewhat narrowed, especially toward the labial border. In one specimen (Cat. No. 822) this plate is a triangle with the apex downward, which does not reach the labial border. In another it enters the border by a narrowervedge than in typical forms. The character is thus variable. The same displacement of the labials brings the fourth labial into the border of the orbit by a short edge in some specimens, but this character is also quite inconstant. On such specimens Baird and Girard proposed their Toricophis pugnax, but under the circumstances the form does not seem to be distinguishable.
In the young of the Ancistrodon piscivorus the colors are brighter, more contrasted, and the pattern therefore more distinct.

Austroriparian region, having a range about equivalent to that of the Siren lacertina, and thus characterizing the region. It extends from southeast Virginia to the Rio Grande and throughout Florida. It ascends the Mississippi to middle Illinois and the Ohio to the Wabash River. It inhabits swamps and the borders of water courses, and catches fishes with ease. It generally seeks the water on being disturbed, but will turn on the pursuer if cornered. Its bite is very dangerous. When about to strike it displays the white interior of its mouth for a short time; hence the name ‘cotton mouth.” In spite of its size and dangerous character fatalities from its bite are less frequent than those occurring from the bites of other Crotalidwe which inhabit places more used by man.

General form robust, but less so than in the A. piscivorus. Rostral plate truncate above and not appearing on the superior face of the muzzle, the lateral borders a little concave. Prefrontals much larger than internasals. T'rontal about as long as wide, the lateral borders about as long as the superciliary borders. The superciliary plates are large, and extend both anterior and posterior to the frontal. Occipitals shorter than parietals, and longer than frontal, and longer than wide. Prenasal about as long as postnasal and much deeper. Loreal as deep as long, its superior border shorter than the inferior. Three preoculars, the superior the largest, longer than deep, and sometimes touching the postnasal above the loreal. Middle preocular narrow and bounding the pit above, cutting off the loreal from its border. Inferior preocular minute, followed anteriorly by the narrow inferior loreal which bounds the pit below. Superior labials generally eight, but frequently seven, the deficiency in number, when present, posterior to the orbit. Second | superior labial twice as high as long, bounding the pit in front and

Temporals 5-6, all smooth; those of the inferior row a little smaller than the labials, the row succeeding upward a little smaller, the rest quite small. Seales of the occiput and nape small, the former smooth, the latter weakly keeled. Inferior labials ten, fourth largest; those following longer than deep. Geneials very short, the posterior shorter and separated by scales.
The body seales are in twenty-three rows and all are keeled, but the first row very indistinctly, the development of the keels increasing upward. Those of the first row are rounded, and they become more— angulate in successive rows to the median line; but they are not narrowed at the latter region.

abdominal seutelle, and suddenly contracting about the middle of the side, so as somewhat to resemble an inverted Y. These blotches extend to the vertebral line, where they may be truncated or end in a rounded apex. Generally those of opposite sides alternate with each other, but frequently they are confluent above, forming continuous bands. They are so disposed that the intervals between the successive blotches are pretty much of the same shape and size, though inverted. The centers of the blotches are lighter; in some cases so much so as greatly to increase the Y-shaped resemblance. Color beneath dull yellowish, with a series of distinct large dark blotches, 35-45 in number, on each side. Chin and throat unspotted. Sides of head cream color; the line of demarcation very distinet; this passes along the upper edge of the head, in front of the eye, and involving the lower three-fourths of the orbit, intersects the middle of the second postorbital plate (counting from above), and extends along the first row above the labials to the posterior edge of the last labial; the line then comes back through the middle of the lower labial range, where it is marked by a narrow black line. Rostral of the same color. A small areolated dark spot near the inner edge of each occipital plate.

In eleven specimens six have the superior labials 8-8; two have them 7-8; and three have them 7-7. The reduction to seven may be regarded as abnormal, since in that case there is generally irregularity. It arises sometimes from the fusion of the seventh and eighth plates, and sometimes from the exclusion of the sixth or seventh from the labial border by contraction below. In the latter case the plate becomes subtriangular and resembles a temporal. The modification is of the same character as that which sometimes affects the second superior labial in the A. piscivorous.

In Sistrurus the hemipenis is finely flounced as is Ancistrodon adding this point of resemblance to the possession of similar headShields. In Crotalus the organ is strongly calyculate, the lower rows becoming flounces in C. basiliscus and C. confluentus, but not in C. horridus, C. durissus, nor C. molossus. My statement that the spines are not ossified in the C. durissus, is due to the fact that I examined a specimen not fully grown, although it was not a very small one.!
This subfamily is characteristically Nearctic. There is but one species (Crotalus terrificus) which is characteristically Neotropical, and there are two other Crotali (C. lugubris and C. basiliscus) which may range into the Neotropical. <A Sistrurus (S. ravus) may overlap in the same way. The greater number of species belong to the Sonoran region.
The geographical distribution of the Crotaline is exhibited as follows—the genus Ancistrodon is added in illustration:

Tail with a rattle at extremity. Head with nine symmetrical plates above. Nostril between two plates. Urosteges undivided. Scales carinated.
This genus, aS is immediately perceived, differs from Crotalus only in the possession of the nine cephalic scuta common to most harmless snakes, the Proteroglypha, and the genera Trigonocephalus and Ancistrodon in Crotalide. The species do not reach so large a size as those of Crotalus, and they are hence less dangerous. Their range is also more restricted, since no species is known from South America or Mexico south of Vera Cruz.
Three well-detined species are known, which differ as follows:

This species has some marked characteristics as compared with other species of the genus. The body is robust at the middle as compared with its extremities; it tapers especially posteriorly, so that the tail is unusually slender. The rattle is proportionally reduced in size, and is smaller than that of other species of the same dimensions. Its form is acuminate and the segments are so small as to have suggested to Linneus the name of the species. The body is at its middle parts compressed toward the middle line, or obtusely roof-shaped. The neck is narrow and compressed, and the head oval in outline.
The canthus rostralis is sharply defined, more so on account of a shallow groove within it on the superior face of the muzzle. The rostral plate is perpendicular, and is not recurved on the muzzle. Its lat

<<<Page: 1165>>>

eral borders are concave but vertical in adaptation to the prenasal plate; below it is slightly expanded; above it slightly truncates the otherwise triangular internasals. The prefrontals have an open angle at the junction of the superciliary and frontal scuta. The frontal is but little wider than each superciliary and presents an open angle forward. Posteriorly it has a parabolic and nct an angular outline, and its apex is on a line with the posterior angles of the superciliaries, with which it incloses a deep notch. Each parietal is sbout the size of the frontal; it is short and is broadly rounded behind.
Both nasal scuta are higher than long, the postnasal the narrowest. One loreal higher than long, entirely separating the postnasal and preoculars. One or two small scales below it and in front of the one which borders the pit. Two preoculars, the inferior sometimes divided into a short posterior and a longer anterior. Superior labials, ten or generally eleven, separated from the front of the orbit by one scale, from the rest of it by two scales. Temporals, except lowest two rows, keeled. Three pairs of geneials separated by a groove; the anterior pair largest. Gular scales smooth. Dorsal scales in twenty-one, sometimes twentythree, longitudinal rows, all carinated, the first and second rows slightly. On the terminal fifth of the tail the urosteges are in two rows. The rattle is a miniature of that of other rattlesnakes, and has a gradual acumination of form. The gastrosteges are fewer in number than in other species, ranging as low as one hundred and twenty-three.
Ground color grayish ash of various depths, punctuated with dark brown. A series of from thirty-eight to forty-five subcircular dorsal blotches extending from head to tail, dark brown, each with a narrow distinct yellowish border. Interval rather narrower than the spots themselves. A broad band of purplish red passes from head to tail through the blotches. On each side may be distinguished three series of blotches, the first on the first and second lateral rows of scales and partly on the abdominal scutelle. The second, alternating with this, on the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows of scales, and opposite the dorsal series. The third, alternating with the second and the dorsal series, on the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows of scales. The latter series is dusky and obsolete; the others are uniform and distinctly black.
The shape of the blotches is subjected to some variation, according to individuals. Generally subcireular or slightly oblong, they become sometimes a transversely elongated quadrangle, three times as long as wide. Their shape varies, according to the region of the body on which they are found. On the anterior third they are subquadrangular, anteriorly and posteriorly emarginated; on the middle region they elongate, and toward the posterior third become nearly circular. Backward of the anus the five or six blotches of that region extend on the sides, without, however, meeting on the lower surface. The blotches of the first lateral row are subquadrangular and a little smaller

<<<Page: 1166>>>

than those of the second and third rows; the blotches of the second row being transversely oblong and largest on the middle region of the body. Side of the head purplish brown. A narrow distinet white line. A deep chestnut-brown vitta, is observed, of the same length, but broader, and lined above with a narrow, dull yellowish margin. Two undulated dark-brown vittie extend from the vertex to the first dorsal blotch and confluent with it. A double crescentic blotch is observed on the frontal scutellie, leaving a transversal fulvous band across the head between the orbits. The color underneath is reddish yellow, marmorated with brownish-black blotches and minute dots.

The distribution of this species is throughout the Austroriparian region of the Nearctic fauna. The distance to which it ascends the Mississippi is as yet unknown. A color variety occurs in Sonora, according to the record of the U. S. National Museum (Cat. No. 6067), which is distinguished by the small size of its dorsal spots. They are two scales long and three wide anteriorly, and one long and seven wide posteriorly, becoming thus transverse. They are widely separated.

There are about forty-two dorsal brown and irregular blotches margined with deep black and encircled with a yellow fillet from the head to the tip of the tail—the thirty-fourth opposite the anus—the last three passing to the sides of the tail but do not meet below. Subcirealar on the posterior half of the body, the blotches on the anterior half are longer transversly than longitudinally; emarginated anteriorly only.
The blotches of the two lateral series are proportionally small. The blotches of the upper series are more or less obsolete and alternate with the dorsal ones. Those of the second lateral series are the smallest and alternate also, being of as deep a color as the dorsal ones, but do not extend beyond the anus, occupying the second, third, and fourth rows of seales. The first and lower series affect the first and second rows, and only one scale. The belly is of a light straw color dotted and sprinkled irregularly with brown.

The characters of the squamation of this subspecies have been already described under the head of the species. It is distinguished by the erect narrow rostral plate, which is truncate above, by the welldefined canthus rostralis, and especially by the trapezoidal loreal,

<<<Page: 1170>>>

which permits the contact of the postnasal and the superior preocular. There are two small scales between it and the labials, and no seales between the circumfossal scale and the labials. One row below orbit in front, and two rows behind the fifth superior labial. Parietals broadly rounded, rather larger than superciliaries. The frontal is narrower than the superciliaries, and does not extend so far posteriorly. Its posterior portion contracts rather abruptly to the median angle. Four or five rows of temporal scales, which aresmooth. Seales of body in twenty-five rows, of which the first is smooth and the second nearly so.
The ground color above is brown; the blotches are deep chestnutbrown blackish externally, and with a yellowish white margin. The dorsal blotches are twenty-four in number from the head to the region opposite the anus, most of which are transversely and irregularly oblong, anteriorly and posteriorly emarginated, less so, however, posteriorly; eight are subcircular. Five or six exist on the tail from the anus to its tip, extending on the sides, the last two forming sometimes a complete ring. The next series on either side is composed of small blotches, but as intensely colored as in the other series. They alternate with the dorsal ones. They have no regularity either in outline or position. The second lateral row is composed of the largest lateral blotches. They are transversely oblong or oval on the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of scales, and opposite the blotches of the dorsal series; consequentiy alternating with the third series above. The first lateral series again is composed of blotches intermediate in size between those of the third and second series; they occupy the first and second rows of scales, and extend somewhat to the abdominal scutelle, and alternating with the adjoining series. Two undulated vittie extend from the supraorbital plates along the neck to the first dorsal blotch, and often confluent with the latter. A linear vitta margined with yellowish white extends from the posterior edge of the eye to the sides of the neck; the inferior yellow margin is the broadest, and passes from the pit close to the angle of the mouth, turning forward to the middle of the lower jaw, inclosing a semielliptical brown patch. Two elongated yellowish spots may be observed diverging from both sides of the pit to the lip. The cephalic plates are deep chestnut brown; a transverse light-brown band extends across the head from one orbit to the other.
The color underneath is blackish brown, intermingled with yellowish.

<<<Page: 1171>>>

specimen in the U. 8. National Museum has nine joints and a button. Measurements.—The entire snake measures 777 mm. in length, of which the rattle is 39mm. (Cat. No. 12752), from Lucknow, Ontario. As the largest species of the genus, the Sistrurus catenatus is the most dangerous. According to Prof. O. P. Hay,' this species is abundant in some parts of Indiana, but he does not confirm its occurrence south of Indianapolis. In this connection he remarks:
D. C. Ridgley reports it from Wabash County. I have seen specimens from Laporte, Hendricks, Hamilton, and Montgomery counties. They appear to be abundant in the swampy grounds in the neighborhood of Lake Maxinkuckee, in Marshall County. The black specimens are frequently found in Indiana. They were once described as a distinct species, but their dark coloration is probably nothing more than an individual variation. We have a very similar case in the differently colored forms of Heterodon platyrhinus, Coluber obsoletus, and Natric sipedon.
This species is, on an average, considerably smaller than the banded rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus. It is, on that account, less to be feared than that serpent, since the fangs would naturally penetrate less deeply, and the amount of poison that is injected into the wound would be less. Indeed, Dr. Kirtland, of Ohio, is quoted as saying that its bite is scarcely worse than the sting of a hornet. But having had a good deal of experience with and knowledge of these snakes, I think they are not to be tampered with. Animals that have been bitten by them, such as dogs and cows, suffer much and have troublesome swellings. The rattle is less powerful than that of its larger relative, but may be heard at a sufficient distance. The snakes appear to prefer low, wet grounds as their habitation, but they are not aquatic. Yet they may often be found far away from water, in dry fields. On the prairies of Illinois, before the country became thickly populated, these reptiles were extremely abundant, and the killing of two or three dozen of them in a season was not an unusual thing for any farmer’s boy. Now, in that same region not one is seen in years. This disappearance of these snakes has been supposed to be due to the destruction wrought among them by hogs. Yet on those prairies in those days there were no roaming hogs, The extinction of the snakes may be due to the breaking up of the soil, the draining of the ponds, and the clearing away of the rank vegetation, which furnishes them protection. At the present day it is only in swamps and marshes that they are found.
It appears that these snakes shed their skins at least twice a year; and since, fur. ther, Garman has shown that the segments of the rattle represent a retained portion of the sloughed epidermal covering, it seems quite probable that two or more joints of the rattle are produced each year. In any case, the age can not be determined by the number of segments, since the terminal ones are continually being worn off and lost.
The young of this species are brought into the world alive. They are about six in number at each brood, and when born are about six inches long. They appear about the Ist of September. This species has been included by Goode in his list of those whose females allow the young a place of safety in the stomach. The writer has published an account of the observations made on two females of this snake by aman of credibility, who had captured them and kept them until they had produced young.2 According to these observations, the young passed freely into and out of the mother’s mouth until they were a month old. After this time the mother was very attentive to the young, as I saw myself.

Urosteges undivided; tail terminating in a jointed rattle. Top of head covered with scales. Body cylindric.
The above simple diagnosis embraces the characters which distinguish the genus Crotalus, This type, the most specialized form of the order Ophidia, is chiefly distributed in North America, to which, if we regard the Mexican plateau as a part of it, twelve of the fifteen species are restricted. Two species are found in South America, but none occur in the West Indies. Within the nearetic region the distribution of species is very unequal. Thus but one species, the C. horridus, is confined to the eastern district. A second, the CO. adamanteus, exists in the austroriparian district, but extends itself from this region westward across and throughout the Sonoran district as far as the Pacific Ocean, occupying also the Lower California district. This distribution is only imitated by the Zamenis flagellum among North American reptiles. The Central and Pacific districts are occupied by another species, C. confluentus, which also extends over the northern part of the Sonoran. To the Sonoran district we must go for five species: C. molossus, C. tigris, C. cerastes, C. lepidus, and C. pyrrhus,

<<<Page: 1173>>>

which are all of rather small dimensions, except the first named. Two others are confined to the Lower California peninsula, C. mitchellii and C. enyo, while two are restricted to the Mexican plateau and its western slope, the C. polystictus and OC. basiliscus.
The variations in structure of these species is not great, and they form a compact generic division. Dr. Coues has proposed to separate the C. cerastes as type of a separate genus, distinguished by the prolongation of the free border of the superciliary plate into a horn-like process. Were this process distinctly articulated at the base from the superciliary plate, as is the case in the viperine genus Cerastes, we should be compelled to adopt such a division; but at present I do not see the way to separate it, especially as the process is often but little pronounced. I have also proposed a generic division for the C. lepidus based on the single nasal plate, but the plate is sometimes divided in part, and for the present I do not adopt the division, or at least until: I can see more specimens of the species.
The origin of the curious epidermal structure at the end of the tail, known as the rattle, is as yet a subject of speculation only. We have, however, so many rudiments of it in other generic divisions oi the Crotalidze that its origin from some of these is evident, and that it occurred at no very late period of geologic time is probable. The terminal caudal vertebrie are coossified, compressed, and expanded into a vertical body, which enters the first or basal button of the rattle. Such a modification is found in a rudimental condition in the genus Lachesis, where it is covered by a simple horny sheath, grooved at the sides. In Sistrurus the rattle is of absolutely and relatively small size, and here we can see the beginnings of the segmentation and inflation of the joints, which constitute the perfected structure. The manner of formation of these segments has not been studied as yet, but the general theory of the origin of the entire structure is probably the same in this case as in others in the animal kingdom. ‘The violent vibrations into which most snakes throw their tails when excited has determined nutritive processes to its extremity and produced the excessive growth.
The species of this genus are of rather sluggish movements, and are not quick to bite unless trodden on. They throw the body into a coil and sound the rattle, giving a sigmoid flexure to the anterior part of the body, on which the head is poised with open mouth ready for action. At this time drops of the poisonous saliva fall from the fangs, and by a violent expulsion of air from the lungs are thrown at their enemy. In the act of biting the movement is threefold. First, there is the spring of the body, which never exceeds two-thirds of its length; second, the bite proper, caused by the seizing by the jaws; and, third, the clutch with the fangs themselves, which are moved freely backward and forward by the flexor and extensor muscles of the maxillary bone on the prefrontal as a fixed point. This grasping movement may be observed in Crotali when very much excited and anxious to bite,

and may be performed by the snake’s head when severed from the body. I had a narrow escape from being bitten in this way by the head of a Crotalus molossus, which was attached to the body by skin only.
Rattlesnakes live in all kinds of ground, but natura!ly persist longest in rocky regions, where they have abundant places of concealment. Some of the species grow to a very large size, particularly the C. adamanteus of North and the C. durissus of South America. The former is probably the larger of the two; at least we have information of larger specimens. Iam credibly informed that specimens have been found on the islands off the Gulf coast of Florida of 8 feet in length. Some specimens of the western subspecies C. a. atrox also reach a large size. The third species in dimensions is the C. horridus, which grows on the coast of North Carolina to a length of 5 feet and proportionate thickness. The species of the plains, C. confluentus, rarely reaches so large a size. Its gray-greenish color readily conceals it in the sparse vegetation and it is only observed when closely approached. It is very abundant north of the Missouri River and extends north to the Saskatchewan, beyond the line of distribution of any other species.
From the effective character of their weapons of offense and defense, rattlesnakes have a great advantage in the struggle for existence against all animals except man and his domestic companion, the pig. Hence in unsettled localities in North America they are abundant, especially in the warm regions of the South and West. In many places they are the most abundant species of snake, as, for instance, on the plains, where no species is as often seen as the Crotalus confluentus. That they have been much more abundant in many wild parts of the East than at present, is indicated by the great quantities of their bones which are found in the caves of the limestone regions of the Mississippi Valley. The pig, as is well known, will destroy and eat rattlesnakes with impunity. It is said that the poison is not sufficiently introduced into the circulation to cause death, owing to the thick adipose layer with which the domesticated pig is covered.
The following synopsis of the characters of the species of Crotalus is the result of long familiarity with them. Some of the forms originally regarded as species are treated as subspecies, owing to the evanescence of their characters. In spite of the subdivision of their head plates, the homologues of the plates of harmless snakes may be traced. Thus, there are from two to three preoculars and from one to four loreals. The nasals are never more than two, and the nostril is always between them. There is one pair of geneials. The species of Section I display homologues of internasal and prefrontal plates, while the same, more divided, are seen species of Section II.
The transitional forms or subspecies in this genus, as is usually the rase, furnish instructive evidence as to the evolution of the character of the species. It is not improbable, as already remarked, that their

<<<Page: 1175>>>

origin is from some genus like Lachesis, which had a scaly head and no rattle.

middle of the orbit. Labials eighteen above, fifth and sixth largest; seventeen below. Dorsal rows of scales twenty-nine. Two external rows small. Tail uniform black. Color roll sulphur, a series of chestnut-brown transverse lozenges, with exterior corners produced to the abdomen. Centers of lozenges with one or two spots. Hach scale but one color. A brown patch below and behind the eye.
Head very broad in front; outline nearly rectangular. NRostral small. Two internasal frontals; behind these four plates, the exterior resting on the superciliary; behind these two other plates, between and in contact with the superciliaries. Anterior nasal subtriangular. Top of head with numerous smooth subtuberculous scales. Suborbitals large, extending to the anterior canthus. General aspect smoother than in Crotali generally, scales rounded at the posterior apex, carinated but slightly.
General color above that of roll sulphur, beneath pale yellowish, posteriorly very faintly clouded with brownish. Tail black. Anteriorly the scutellie are entirely immaculate. Along the back is a series of transverse reddish or chestnut-brown lozenges embraced in a width of twelve or fourteen scales and four or five scales long, and with the exterior angles produced to the abdomen. These lozenges are frames with the outline generally one scale in width and with the centers of the ground color; sometimes divided by a median line of brown, so as to show two yellowish spots inside of the lozenges. The scales exterior to the lozenges are rather lighter. Sometimes the brown rings and the lozenges widen at the abdomen and indicate lateral spots of four scales; at others, and especially anteriorly, the rings are obsolete, and the brown is in a dorsal series. In fact, for the anterior fourth of the body we have a dorsal patch of brown, showing alternately at successive intervals one large yellowish spot and then a pair of smaller ones, owing to the confluence of the successive lozenges. The superciliaries and seales anterior to them, as well as a broad patch below and behind the eye, light greenish brown. ‘Tail uniform dark brown above, paler beneath. Only one button with two necks, no rattle.
A remarkable character of this species is that each individual scale is of a uniform tint to its base, and does not show two colors, as in other species.

This large species is the only one within our political limits which possesses the characters of the head scales found in the Neotropical species. Among these it approaches nearest the C. basiliscus Cope.! That species has, however, well-defined dorsal rhombs, as in C. terrificus, C. adamanteus, ete. Its habitat is southern New Mexico and Arizona and northern Sonora and probably Chihuahua. It is the largest and

most dangerous species of that region, where it is known as the “black tail.”
Near Lake Valley, southern New Mexico, I killed a fine specimen of this species, which I discovered in the act of springing through a bush. When I struck it, it was suspended over a branch, looking at me. It was heavy in its movements, except at the moment of leaping.

This is the largest species of the Tierra Templada of Mexico, and it ranges over the whole of it. Dr. Dugés has found it near Guanajuato, and it oceurs in the Valley of Mexico. I described it from a specimen from Colima, and the Geographical Commission of Mexico found it afterwards in the State of Puebla. It has not yet been found within the linits of the United States. Boulenger does not distinguish it from the C. durissus of South America, which occurs in the Tierra Caliente of Mexico.

This species presents greater variations than any other known, and its subspecies have been regarded as species. I find transition from one to the other of these forms, however, and they forbid recognition of more than one species. This form ranges from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the warmer parts of North America, and descends to Chihuahua and Cape St. Lueas to the southward in Mexico. This is the largest and most formidable species of the genus, examples eight feet in length having been reported to me from the Gulf coast of Florida by Admiral McCauley, U.S. N.
The subspecies differ as follows:

rower posteriorly than in C. lucifer, and the nose is much more depressed, the rostral being triangular and as wide as high, while in C. lucifer it is —athird higher than wide. There are two small subtriangular or subcircular internasals in contact, and behind these is a row of four seales, the outer and largest one lying directly over the nostril; posterior to these is a third row of five or six scales connecting the anterior extremities of the superciliaries, the external scale of which row is a little in advance of the rest; behind this row two very large scales connect the superciliaries, behind which the crown is covered with plates much larger than in C. lucifer. The space between the superciliaries is narrower than in C. lucifer, and is occupied in front by but two longitudinal rows of scales, while there are six to eight in the former species. The rattle is more slender than in any other species excepting C. cerastes. The markings on the body of this species are much as in C. atrow and

The ground color is light yellowish or brownish ash; on the middle third of the body there is a dorsal series of rhomboidal blotches more or less truncated before and behind; anteriorly they become elongated longitudinally, and not only truncated, but sometimes emarginate on the longitudinal angles, while the lateral angles are rounded, leaving the blotches subcircular. Posteriorly the dorsal blotches continue to have the lateral angles acute and perfect till they become confluent with a lateral series, and form nineteen half rings, six of which are on the tail. In the middle third of the body the dorsal blotches are included in eleven or twelve dorsal rows and are four to four and a half seales in longitudinal extent; anteriorly they become longer longitudinally, and only nine to ten scales in transverse diameter. The dorsal blotches are light brown, bordered for the width of one scale with darker. They are separated along the backs by a line of the ground color one and a half to two scales in width, and imme

<<<Page: 1183>>>

diately bordered by a narrow line lighter than the ground color, as in 0. confluentus, C. a. atrox, and C. a. adamanteus, this line being about a hali scale in width. Posteriorly the light intervals betweeu the rings widen to three or three and a half scales, while the rings themselves become much narrower, being only two to three scales wide. On the middle third of the body below, and opposite to the dorsal series, is another row of small rhomboidal or sometimes triangular brown blotches on each side. They involve four to six scales and extend from the second to the fifth lateral row of scales, and are bordered by light lines like the dorsal series, from which they are separated by a single scale. Indications are seen of another series of small blotches resting directly upon the abdominal scutelle, alternating with and a little lower than the first lateral series. The abdomen is whitish yellow without distinct blotches. A light line from posterior angle of superciliary and orbit to angle of jaw above labials, and another from before the eye to labials. The markings of the head of this species seem to be very nearly the same as in C. lucifer. There is, however, indications of a light border to the external edge of the superciliary, and the rostral and entire space in front of the nostril and pit, as well as a little posterior to these, is as dark as the crown, while in C. lucifer they are distinctly lighter.
Though this subspecies so closely resembles O. adamanteus atro.v, it will be readily distinguished by the large plates of the head and by the dorsal rhombs being more imperfect in their outlines anteriorly and posteriorly. The type specimen (Cat. No. 5021), and another (Cat. No. 8669), might be properly referred to Section I of the genus with the C. molossus, Since the anterior head scuta are quite identical with those of that group, but Cat. Nos. 14225 and 14278 show division of these plates. The tendency to form parietal scuta is peculiar to this subspecies. Like the C. molossus, its habitat is on either side of the United States and Mexican boundary, where it is not uncommon. I have not seen specimens from south of the city of Chihuahua. Dr. Boulenger! records it from Huamautla.

Head wide posteriorly; muzzle obtuse, not especially elevated. Nasal plates distinct from each other and separated from the two elongate preoculars by two loreals, of which the superior is the smaller, being sometimes quite small. Two rather small internasal plates which are connected with the superciliaries by two large plates of the canthus rostralis, the posterior one of these being quite large. Seven or eight rows of smooth scales between inner edges of superciliaries. Three rows of scales between orbits and superior labials. The latter number fifteen, the inferior eighteen. The scales of the cheek are smooth. Seales in twenty-seven or twenty-nine rows, the two inferior rows smooth, the third and fourth obsoletely, the rest strongly keeled.
Seales on the back and sides not conspicuously different in size except the lower two or three rows. Posteriorly, near the tail, all the scales are carinated; except the lowest.
General color, yellowish gray, with rhomboidal black blotches, lighter in the center, and with all the angles perfect. Or rather there is a series of dull yellowish lines crossing obliquely from one side of the abdomen to the other over the back, following the oblique series of scales, and occupying generally the posterior half of each scale, the basal portion being black. These lines, of which there are about thirty-six crossing from each side, from head to tail (nine on tail), decussate first on the fifth or sixth lateral row, and then on the back, where they are more or less confluent three or four rows. The rhomboids thus enclosed and crossing the back are generally black for one and one half or two scales within the yellowish lines, and the most central portion is dark yellowish brown, mottled with darker. The intervals on the sides between the lines are mostly dark yellowish brown, minutely mottled with dark brown. These intervals constitute a lateral series of transverse rhomboids, sometimes with the lower angle truncated. Opposite to the dorsal rhomboids is a series of small triangles in the angles of the first decussation. The distance between

<<<Page: 1185>>>

two parallel transverse stripes generally consists of five rows of scales, occasionally of six.
On the sides and posteriorly these markings are more or less indistinct, though generally recognizable. The tail usually exhibits a good deal of black. The under parts are dull yellowish white, or greenish

white, clouded toward the sides with brown. No regular spots visible. The black on the tail does not constitute complete rings, but is interrupted in the middle of the lower surface, and in fact the black patches alternate with each other, and are not opposite. . The last patch, however, forms a complete ring wider than the rest, so that the end of the tail is black. This is peculiar to the subspecies OC. a. adamanteus.

The top of the head is light brown, with occasional black scales. A dull yellowish streak starts at the posterior edge of the superciliary plate, and passing obliquely backward, through two rows of scales, extends to the angle of the mouth. A second band starts on the plate in advance of the superciliary, and crossing the anterior orbitals, expands till it involves the seventh, eighth, and ninth upper labials. Interval between the first two stripes dark brown. There are also indications of a second vertical light bar in front of the nostril, and two below the pit.

The largest specimen now in the U. 8. National Museum is 6 feet in length, or 2.025 mm.; the tail measures 235 mm., of which the rattleis 70mm. The latter, though broken, has twelve joints and a button. The rhombs on the posterior part of the body are very obscure, and the tail bands are not so black as in younger specimens. Professor Holbrook mentions specimens of 8 feet in length and Admiral E. Y. McCauley, U.S. N., assures me that he has seen specimens of that size on the island off Pensacola, Florida. This is, then, the most bulky of the venomous snakes. The Najid Ophiophagus bungarus exceeds it in length, but is a slender snake.

Dr. Einar Leennberg! writes of this species as follows:
In the interior of Florida the diamond-backed rattlesnake is scarce, but not so along the coast and on some of the Florida keys. In the neighborhood of Ozona, in Hillsboro County, I heard of the killing of nine rattlesnakes within two weeks in October, 1893. It evidently prefers the neighborhood of the water, and is a good swimmer, not afraid to cross over from ‘‘ key” to ‘‘key.” If not too often disturbed this species is slow and does not rattle unless offended. I saw one in the latter part of October in the pine woods near Toronto, Orange County, coiled up under a palmetto bush. A dog following us went up and sniffed at him, with his nose hardly a foot from the snake. We called the dog back, and a man ran forward with a whip and struck the snake several times. After the second blow the snake began to rattle and make himself ready to strike. This shows plainly the slow nature of the snake, In other cases they are more easily offended, Those kept in boxes and cages often begin to rattle as soon as they see anyone approaching. They are easy to keep alive, and take food without trouble. I saw one that was kept in a small box and was fed with toads; it did so well there that it changed its skin twice ina summer, They are often kept in the shops of taxidermists and in ‘ curiosity stores,” where northern tourists buy them, paying good prices. The skin is often used for ornaments or for the manufacture of pocketbooks and similar objects.
People are very seldom bitten by rattlesnakes in Florida. The rattling, the strong odor, and the slowness of the snake are protective. The snake is often caught by placing an empty barrel over the coils, after which a board is shoved under the snake and the whole thing turned over.

General style of coloration somewhat as in C. adamanteus. Groundcolor above dull yellowish brown, with a series of subhexagonal patches from the head nearly to the tail, in an uninterrupted series, separated throughout by narrow lines. We may refer the markings to the intersection of light yellowish lines, about forty in number, crossing obliquely from each side across to the other, along the anterior half of as many oblique series of scales. The lateral decussation is along the sixth row

of dorsal scales; on the back, where they cross, the lines are confluent for a breadth of five or six scales, making a series of transverse lines across the back, truncating the obtuse angles of the rhomboids, which would otherwise be produced. Sometimes the acute lateral angle of the rhomboids are also truncated. Laterally, the yellowish lines are more or less obsolete, leaving a more or less distinct chain pattern. The rhomboids or subrhomboids inclosed have a narrow margin of dark brown, lighter toward the center. In all cases the interval between the successive rhomboids is but one or two half scales in width. The lateral rhomboids and triangles referred to in C. a. adamanteus are indicated by two alternating series of dark brown blotches, the first along the third and fourth lateral row, opposite the apices of the rhomboids; the second along the sixth and seventh, and alternating with the

same; the spots occupy one scale, or part of four contiguous ones. Space between these rhomboids and the yellowish lines is dull yellowish brown. Beneath nearly uniform yellowish, slightly clouded on the sides of the scales. On the tail the blotches are confluent into three or six dark brown half rings, interrupted on the under surface. General distribution of lines on the head much as in C. a. adamanteus; a narrow light line from the posterior end of the superciliary backward, directly to the angle of the mouth; a second from the anterior extremity, nearly parallel with the first, the two inclosing an indistinct patch, and separated on the labials by four and one-half scales. There is also a single narrow light line across the superciliary obsolete in old specimens.

<<<Page: 1189>>>

It may readily be distinguished from C. a. adamanteus by its light color and the truncations of the rhomboids, as well as the general obsoleteness of the lateral markings. The rhomboids are longer in proportion and more rounded. The two lateral rows of scales are smooth, the next two more strongly carinated than in C. a. adamanteus. The fifth upper labial is largest, and transverse; the rest nearly uniform. The stripes on the head are less distinct. The last black band on the tail is not so wide, and does not embrace it so as to form a black termination of that organ. The subspecies atrox has in general the paler characters which western representatives of eastern species so often present, excepting in regard to the black bands of the tail, which are quite as deep in color as in the eastern adamanteus.
As compared with the Crotalus confluentus, which this subspecies resembles at first sight, these color characters always distinguish it. These are in the latter: First, the passage of the dark postocular band above the angle of the mouth; second, the absence of black rings on the tail, and third, the nonrhombic form of the dorsal spots.

Four specimens from near Cape St. Lucas, Lower California (Cat. No. 12645), all have two loreals as in the subspecies adamanteus. In all other respects these specimens are like the true atroxv, except that in one the posterior canthal plate is smaller than usual, but not so small as in the subspecies ruber. A specimen (Cat. No. 467) from the Great Basin has the bleached appearance of the form. C. confluentus lecontet, which inhabits the same region.
This form has the manners of the typical subspecies. I observed a pair of fully grown ones on the headwaters of the Colorado River in Borden County, Texas. They were rather sluggish. One I caught in a noose and suspended it on a stick until dead. The other one retreated among the rocks as fast as pursued, and. was allowed to escape.

Muzzle shortened. Rostral plate a little wider than high; plates ot upper side of canthus rostralis smaller than in other species, the posterior especially, being smaller than the anterior, and descend laterally, obliterating the canthus rostralis and the superior loreal. One loreal. Five rows of scales between orbit and labials; eight rows between superciliary plates.
The color is light red or reddish brown, marked above with deep red or reddish spots. These are of a longitudinally oval form anteriorly, but posteriorly they have a diamond-shaped form. They have no distinet lateral borders, either light or dark; but they are separated on the median line of the back by a single row of yellow-tipped scales. Traces of brownish-red indefinite spots opposite their lateral angles as well as their interiorals. Head without marking, except a faint trace of a pale line from the eye to the border of the mouth below it. Inferior surfaces, yellow. Tail, white with five black cross-bands, of which all but the first are complete rings.
Cat. No. 9209; scales, 27; upper labials, 17; gastrosteges, 186; urosteges, 26; total length, 1,245 mm. (with rattle); length of tail, 122 mm. (with rattle); rattle, 44 mm. (seven joints and a button).
The accession of three specimens besides the type, since its description, enables me to define this form more exactly, and to raise it to the

<<<Page: 1191>>>

rank of .a species. All the characters ascribed to it turn out to be constant, excepting that probably the red color is in some specimens replaced by chestnut brown. Its affinities are with the C. adamanteus atrox, but its general appearance is more like that of the C. confluentus lucifer. The cutting off of the labial part of the first inferior labial plate is present in all the specimens of the C. ruber. This is frequently

met with in C. a. atrox, but does not occur in any other species. The direction of the postocular band and the coloration of the tail is also as in C. a. atrox, On the other hand, the reversed relation of size between the internasal and posterior canthal (or lateral prefrontal) is not found —
in the C. a. atrox nor in any of the forms of the C. adamanteus or C. confluentus, and its lateral decurvature is only approached by some

specimens of the OC. ¢. lucifer. It is in the dorsal coloration that the C. ruber resembles the C. c. lucifer, but the broad, ill-detined postocular band not passing beyond the canthus of the mouth and the white tail with black rings easily distinguish it from the common form of the Pacific coast.
This is a large species; besides Cat. No. 9209 above measured, Cat. No. 20381 measures 1,400 mm. and Cat. No. 19269; 1,180 mm.
Dr. Stejneger remarks! that the characters by which I originally defined this form ‘*do not seem to hold in a larger series.” I find on examining the same material that the characters are fully substantiated.
The habitat of the C. ruber is southern California as far north as San Francisco. Mr. Van Denburgh reports a head from Ensenada, in the adjacent part of Lower California, but as he remarks that the only peculiarity it presents is that of color the identification may be for the present regarded as doubtful.
In young specimens the color markings are better defined. This is the case with Cat. No. 8856, where the dorsal spots are rhombic on the posterior three-quarters of the body, and are parallelogrammic on the anterior fourth, and the pale lateral borders are very faintly indicated. Details as follows:
Cat. No. 8856; rows of scales, 29; upper labials, 15; gastrosteges, 194; urosteges, 21; total length, 600 mm.; length of tail, 52 mm.; rattle, 22 mm.

Color light brown, with one row of dark brown spots usually paler edged, on the median line of the back, which are generally longer than wide anteriorly, but soon become transversely oval, and ultimately assume the form of cross-bands. Tail of the same color as the body, with cross-bands of the color of the dorsal spots. Belly unspotted, but with dark shades in some forms.
Four well-defined subspecies are embraced in this species; they are defined as follows:
Cephalic scales larger; 4 rows between superciliary plates, 4 rows below orbit; dorsal spots and cephalic bands light edged; few posterior cross bands. --confluentus Cephalic scales intermediate; 6 rows between superciliaries; 3 rows below orbit
(probably sometimes 4) ; dorsal spots square, with the head bands, not light edged;
posterior cross bands more numerous; color dotted with brown specks. pulverulentus

The distribution of these subspecies is as follows: The typical one inhabits the plains including western Texas and southern California, also C. c. lecontei belongs to the Great Basin. The C. ¢. pulverulentus is a form of the Sonoran district; while the C. ¢. lucifer inhabits the Pacific district to its eastern limit, the northern Rocky Mountains.

consists of six, not four as in C. atrox. Superciliaries more prominent. Labial series mach smaller. Upper anterior orbitals much smaller, as also is the anterior nasal. Scales on the top of the head Jess carinated. Seales between superciliaries smaller and more numerous, five or six in number instead of four. Two lateral rows of scales smooth, first, second, and third gradually increasing in size. Scales more linear than in C. atrox.
General color yellowish brown with a series of subquadrate dark blotches, with the corners rounded and the anterior and posterior sides frequently concave, the exterior convex. These blotches are ten or eleven scales wide and four or five long, lighter in the center, and margined for one-third of a scale with light yellowish. ‘The intervals

along the back light brown, darker than the margins of the blotches. Anteriorly the interval between the dark spots is but a single scale; posteriorly it is more, becoming sometimes two scales, where also the spots are more rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped ; nearer the tail, however, they become transversely quadrate. The fundamental theory of coloration might be likened to that of Crotalus adamanteus, namely, of forty or fifty light lines decussating each other from opposite sides; but the angles of decussation, instead of being acute, are obtuse, and truncated or rounded off throughout. Along the third, fourth, and fifth lateral ‘rows of scales is a series of indistinct brown blotches covering a space of about four scales and falling opposite to the dorsal blotches; between these blotches, and opposite to the intervals of the dorsal blotches, are

<<<Page: 1195>>>

others less distinct. Along the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows is a second series of obsolete blotches, each covering a space of about four scales, and just opposite the intervals between the dorsal spots. The dorsal and lower series are separated by an interval of three scales, this interval light brown. Beneath, the color is dull yellowish, and ten or twelve darker half rings are visible on the tail.
In point of coloration the principal features, as compared with C. a. atrox, lie in the dorsal blotches, being disposed in subquadrate spots instead of subrhomboids; the intervals thus forming bands across the back perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. This tendency to assume the subquadrangular pattern has broken up the chain-work into isolated portions, as in Osceola doliata triangula, or Sistrurus tergeminus. The intervals of the dorsal blotches are wide and darker in the middle, while in C. a. atrox they are narrow, not linear, and unicolor.
The sides of the head present the usual light stripe from the posterior °
extremity of the superciliary; it passes, however, to. the angle of the jaw on the neck, along the second row of scales above the labials. A sgcond stripe passes in front of the eye to the labials, widening there. A small light vertical bar is seen below the pit, and another on the outer edge of the rostral. On the superciliaries are seen two light transverse lines inclosing a space nearly one-third of the whole surface. In CO. a. atrox there is a single median line. Sometimes, as in C. a. atroa, the single blotches on the nape are replaced by two elongated ones parallel to each other.

This rattlesnake is a universal companion of the prairie marmot, Cynomys ludovicianus. IL have observed them together from near the Canadian border in Montana to the southern extremity of the staked plains in central western Texas. Not only do the marmots provide them food, but their burrows furnish them a safe refuge. In some regions the wild rat Neotoma does the same service. I well remember a large Crotalus which dwelt in apparent harmony with a rat and her family near a camp north of Clarendon, in the Panhandle of Texas. Both the snake and the rat were fat, but no young rats were in sight.
This is the familiar rattlesnake of the plains. They are frequently found near the camp of the traveler, and, like others of their genus, inflict no injury unless provoked or hurt. The bite is, however, frequently fatai if fairly delivered. When the head is raised in the act of attack the light stripes of the muzzle and lips present a handsome appearance.
Dr. H. A. Brons gives his experience of the relations between the rattlesnake, prairie marmot, and the prairie owls in the following language:!
Prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) seem to have a most intense dread of rattlesnakes (Crotalus confluentus). This little animal dreads not only its venomous bite, but more the loss of its young, which serve as food for these snakes that enter their burrows, take possession, and drive them from their homes. Where does one find a
prairie-dog town but that it is teeming with snakes and the strange little owl (Speotyto cunivularia) that ‘‘ducks” to ye in ludicrous solemnity? These do
agneniean Wataralist XVI, 1882, p. p. 565.

<<<Page: 1197>>>

not constitute a happy family. The owls, though they generally occupy an abandoned hole or burrow, destroy the young dogs. Nor do the eggs and nestlings of the owls fare with any better treatment from the snakes; between these exists much enmity. One afternoon, while passing through one of these dog towns in Wallace County, Kansas, we heard a most unusual noise and stir (in the town), as though they were holding a bellicose council. They were collected around a hill, into which they were scraping dirt vigorously. On examining the burrow it was found to contain a large rattlesnake that the dogs were trying to entomb. I noticed this several times, as did other members of our party. To leave no doubt upon the subject, we dug out the snakes after shooting them.

Lake Valley, New Mexico. Collection of E, D. Cope.
Cephalic scales intermediate; six rows between superciliaries; three rows below orbit (probably sometimes four); dorsal spots square, with the headbands, not light edged; posterior cross bands more numerous; colors dotted with brown specks. The ground is a yellowish brown, and the belly is light yellow. The dorsal spots are a darker brown, and are composed of dense punctulations of uniform tint throughout. Bands on head indistinct.
The C. c. pulverulentus at first sight resembles the Crotalus mitchell, having much the same coloration, but the head scales and plates are quite different. 1t gives out a powerful musky odor when excited, which I have not noticed in the typical form of the species.
I have two specimens in my collection which I took near Lake Valley, Sierra County, New Mexico, about 60 miles north of the border of Mexico. I nearly stepped on one of them on a hot day, and‘ he violently resented the intrusion. At a safe distance I annoyed him by tossing pebbles, sticks, ete., at him, and he made unsuccessful efforts to reach me. As he lay with head erect and mouth open, the poison

dripped from his fangs and, with his violent expiration or hisses, was thrown toward, without reaching me. My ascription of this habit to rattlesnakes in my Synopsis of Snakes of North America! brought out in the pages of Forest and Stream some vigorous protests and assertions that I was quite in error. Among my critics was Capt. Charles Bendire, who has seen a great deal of rattlesnakes in the West. However, the circumstance occurred as I now state it. At the same time it is the only time that I have observed it. The habit is probably not common among rattlesnakes, but it is nevertheless usual among venomous snakes, and the genus Crotalus is not likely to be an exception.

This form is the ©. confluentus of the Great Basin. Although it is quite different from the typical C. confluentus, 1 can not distinguish it as a species. It is indeed more closely allied to the Californian subspecies C. ¢. lucifer, and although it is not difficult to distinguish most individuals of the two, the differences rest largely on color and form of the head and other features of no great constancy.
Cephalic scales smallest; eight rows between superciliaries ; four rows below orbit; dorsal spots and headbands light-edged or not; numerous posterior cross-bands. The general appearance is that of a

bleached-looking C. c. confluentus, with a peculiarity in the dorsal spots. These consist of a dark brown circumference only, the centers differing little from the ground color. The bands and stripes on the head are wanting or obsolete, the postorbital being faintly indicated. Instead of these there are irregular blackish splotches more or less confluent on the top of the head between the orbits and behind that region. The tail bands are very distinct.
Cat. No. 4617; rows of scales, 25; upper labials, 16; gastrosteges, 169; urosteges, 23; total length, 828 mm. (with rattle); length of tail, 97 mm. (with rattle); rattle, 48 mm.
This subspecies agrees with the C.c. lucifer in the small size of the scales which cover the head, but differs from it greatly in color. While this forms the palest of the subspecies, the OC. ¢. lucifer is the most deeply colored, in agreement with the general law of Allen, namely, that the pale types inhabit dry regions, and the dwellers in moist climates are more heavily pigmented.

Seales in front of the superciliaries variable. In one specimen there are two rows of four each, of considerable size; in another they are larger than the rest, but irregular. Scales on the cheeks large, flat, smooth.
Ground color, light brown above. Along the back a series of subhexagonal or octagonal blotches, formed by a skeleton of dull yellowish, constituting a dorsal chain. The space thus inclosed of the groundcolor is margined faintly with dark brown. The width of the interval between the successive blotches is from one-half to one and a half scales. These spots are frequently confluent, two and three running together. Where most distinct the spots are four scales long and eleven wide. On each side of this dorsal series is a second, separated by a single row of scales, the blotches extending from the abdominal scutelle to the fifth or sixth row. These are smaller than the dorsal

and subeireular. Opposite the transverse light bands, and in the open space between four contiguous blotches on the sides, smaller blotches are indistinctly visible. Posteriorly the spots on the back and sides are confluent and darker, in one specimen forming seventeen half rings, encircling the back, leaving about twenty-four dorsal blotches. Abdomen greenish yellow, more or less clouded with brown at the bases of the scales. Head dark brown; a light line from posterior portion of the superciliaries along the fourth row of supralabial scales back to the angle of the jaws, on the occiput, where it expands into the color of the under part. Upper labials of the same light color behind, rapidly widening anteriorly so as to include whole front and side of the face, leaving only the top of the head dark. The space about the facial pit darker.

<<<Page: 1201>>>

The theory of coloration is that of decussating lines, which, when they intersect, unite so as to have the angles of intersection truncated.
The species has a general resemblance to C. a. atrox in the arrangement of the blotches, but is darker, and has about seventeen dark half rings posteriorly instead of four or five. In C. a. atrox the head is narrower and more triangular, the space between the superciliaries narrow, and occupied by angulated larger scales instead of small tuberculous ones. In C.a. atrox the row bordering the superciliaries is much larger than the rest, and the scales on the top of the head generally more angulated. In C. ¢. lucifer the line on the side of the head, instead of going directly from tbe posterior end of the superciliary to the commissures, passes back nearly parallel to the mouth, crossing along the fourth row of scales above the labial. The second line in front of the eye is much wider below in C.c. lucifer, and the face generally shows more of white, while the dark portions are much darker.
In small specimens the colors are much brighter and the pattern better defined. Such individuals graduate into the C. c. confluentus of corresponding age which are found in southern California. On the other hand, the large specimens become obscure in the pattern of coloration, and lose various marks; for instance, the superior border of the postocular band and the lateral borders of the dorsal spots. This _ form is simply the dark-colored phase of C. confluentus, characteristic of a relatively wet climate.
As already remarked, this subspecies is directly connected with the typical one C. ¢. confluentus by the intermediate form C. c. lecontet. This gradation is especially evident in specimens from the mountains of Arizona, where the colors are apt to be dark; as for instance in specimen, Cat. No, 8397.

Dr. Stejneger, in his report upon the reptiles of the Death Valley Expedition, says:
The present species is characteristic of the interior valley and slopes of California as contrasted with the Great Basin, and the boundary between the two forms seems to be quite sharply drawn, at least in the regions visited by the expedition. There is probably no stronger contrast among the reptiles of the same genus met with by the Death Valley explorers than that between the pale and clay-colored rattlesnakes in the desert plains and mountains, and the dark-colored C. lucifer which they obtained only in the San Joaquin Valley and in the mountain slopes encircling it.
The distribution of this subspecies is given by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the same publication, as follows:
This species does not inhabit the Great Basin, but was found in a number of localities on the west or costal slope of the Sierra, and in the San Joaquin Valley. Speci

The ground color of the alcoholic specimens is a light yellowish gray above and a dirty white below. The median dorsal line is crossed by numerous transverse hexagons of a brown color, which is punctulated with a darker brown. The interspaces of two scales on the middle line are pigmented probably yellow in life. On the inferior four or five rows of scales opposite the lateral angles of the hexagons is a series of vertical brown bars or spots. Near the anterior fourth of the length these fuse with the hexagons, forming cross-bands, which continue to the end of the tail. They are wide at the middle and narrow at the sides of the body, and are separated on the median line above by the pigmented

The colors of the head are indistinct. There is a brownish-gray postocular band which extends to the angle of the mouth, the superior border not well defined, the inferior one a yellowish band, which is as wide as the eye and reaches the labial border below it. A large spot on each side of the nape above the suspensorium of the lower jaw, which sends forward a shade to the inner border of the superciliary plate on each side.

The lateral spots are represénted by traces only on the anterior third of the length. The dorsal spots have brown borders, while the interiors are but little darker than the ground color, and are not punctulate. The interspaces are not yellow. The head markings, except the postorbital band, are wanting.

The large number of specimens of this species obtained by the Death Valley exploring expedition enables me to add considerably to the knowledge of its characters. The division of the supraorbital plate is present in all of the new specimens, but in various degrees. It is indistinctly indicated in one -of the types, and may have been indicated in the other, but have been obliterated by long soaking in weak spirits. This division, when complete, is into three parts—an anterior smaller and a posterior larger, and a still smaller marginal, produced by the bifurcation of the transverse suture. This marginal scute is frequently only half defined. This structure is, in some of its conditions, probably similar to that which gave origin to the horn of the C. cerastes, which is a prolongation of a fold of the supraorbital plate defined by two grooves. The number of loreal piates varies from one to three, but one is the more common number.
This species is nearest the C. enyo Cope of the Lower Californian Peninsula. It differs from that species in the smoothness of the head scales, which are strongly-carinate in C. enyo; also in the presence of keels on all the body scales, except sometimes one row, instead of the five and six smooth rows on each side. The color is materially different, since the C. tigris is a pale form apparently adapted to desert surroundings, while the colors of the C. enyo, especially the head bands, are bright and strong. The pattern is not very different, but the lateral angles of the dorsal hexagons have a black apex in the C. enyo, which is wanting in C. tigris, and head bands are wanting or very indistinct.

The distribution of this species is commented on by Dr. Stejneger in his report on the reptiles of the Death Valley expedition as follows:
The ‘‘tiger rattler,” of which the expedition has brought home quite aseries, is one of the rarest species in collections. Discovered during the survey of the boundary between the United States and Mexico, and described by Kennicott, the habitat of the species was given in general terms as ‘ Deserts of Gila and Colorado,” but I can find no evidence of specimens recorded from anywhere except from the Sierra del Pozo Verde,' in Arizona. A specimen was afterwards collected by Dr. Irwin at Fort Buchanan, Arizona, and recorded by Dr. Yarrow in his Catalogue of the Reptiles and Batrachians in the U. 8. National Museum (No. 5271). Dr. J. G. Cooper has since enumerated C. tigris from the California side of the ‘Colorado Valley,” but whether he based his record upon specimens actually collected (in which case, probably near Fort Mohave), or only upon the general statement in the report of the Mexican Boundary Survey, I do not know.
It does not appear to have been collected by any of the many parties of the Pacific Railroad Surveys, nor was it brought home by the herpetologists of the Wheeler expedition west of the one hundredth meridian.
The extension of its known range by the present expedition is therefore very material, and is the more interesting since it was found almost over the entire desert area visited. So far from being restricted to the Colorado Valley proper, as surmised by Dr. Cooper, it seems to be chiefly confined to the desert mountain ranges, in which it ascends to a considerable altitude, as shown by the table below, while horizontally its range has been extended over quite a considerable area of southern Nevada.
A study of the present-series convinces me that the nearest affinity of the “tiger rattler” is with the true Crotalus confluentus of the plains, in spite of the rather striking and, in many respects, peculiar aspect of the former.
Dr. Merriam gives the following note in his report on the results of the Death Valley expedition:
The known range of this exceedingly rare rattlesnake has been greatly extended by the expedition, specimens having been secured at frequent intervals from Owens Valley, in California, to the Great Bend of the Colorado, on the boundary between Nevada and Arizona. It was usually found in rocky places in the desert ranges— rarely in the intervening valleys.
When passing through Emigrant Canyon, in the Panamint Mountains, in California, April 15, two large rattlesnakes of this species were killed at one shot by Mr. Stephens, at an altitude of 1,400 meters (4,600 feet). They were on a ledge of rock, and were standing erect with their heads near together, apparently playing. In Indian Spring Valley, north of the Charleston Mountains, in Nevada, one was found in a wood rat’s nest that was dug open to secure a large scaly lizard (Sceloporus magister) which had taken refuge there. Its stomach contained a kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) and a pocket mouse (Perognathus), indicating nocturnal habits. Others were killed in the upper part of Vegas Valley (near Cottonwood Springs) and Vegas Wash, Nevada, and in Owens Valley (on Independence Creek), Coso Valley, the Argus Range Slate Range, Panamint Range,and Grapevine Mountains, California. In the Argus Range nineteen were killed in or near Shepherd Canyon, during the latter part of April and first week of May, by Dr. Fisher's party.
U. S. and Mex. Bound. Surv. (See I, Pt. 1, p. 121, and Pt. 2, p. 70). This range is situated on the boundary between Arizona and Sonora, nearly due south of Baboquivari Peak, and about 50 miles northwest of Nogales. A spring known as Agua del Pozo Verde (Green Well) is situated at the foot of the western slope near the southern end of the range.

CROTALUS PRICEI Van Denburgh.
Crotalus pricei VAN DENBURGH, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci., 1895, p. 856. I copy the following description from Van Denburgh, as I havenotseen the species:
Small; internasal and prefrontal plates large; anterior nasal in contact with rostral; supraocular normal; nine supralabials; 153-159 gastrosteges; two rows of small dorsal spots; belly dark slate.
Head subtriangular; rostral nearly as broad as high; two nasal, one loreal, and two preocular plates; two internasals; four prefrontals; one to three rows of scales between supraoculars; nine supralabials; nine infralabials, first pair in contact on the median line; one row of scales between labials and orbit; scales in twenty-one rows, parts of the lower two smooth; gastrosteges one hundred and fifty-three to one hundred and fifty nine; urosteges twenty-one to twenty-seven, the first and from two to nine of the posterior ones usually divided; rattle very slender and delicate.
The general ground color is olive gray so thickly covered with minute brown dots as to give the animal a decidedly brownish hue. A narrow dark brown band of uniform width runs back and down from the eye just touching the upper angles of the eighth and ninth labials without involving them. The scales below this band are vinaceous cream. ‘There are two small seal brown spots on the occiput. The geneials and gulars are yellow tinged with vinaceous laterally. The rest of the head is unicolor. Along each side of the back is a series of from fifty-four to sixty small brown blotches. Anteriorly these have a tendency to alternate, but posteriorly they unite with one another to form crossbars. There are seven similar brown bars ou the tail. The dorsal blotches are seal brown, palest centrally, and are edged with very pale brown or white. They are about one and one-half scales long, and

<<<Page: 1208>>>

from two to three rows of scales wide. They are separated from the other blotches on the same side of the back by about one and one-half scales, and from those of the opposite side by the width of one scale. There are two or three rows of smaller alternating brown spots on the sides. The gastrosteges, except anteriorly, are dark slate. The edges of the gastrosteges and of the scales of the first row are whitish. The tip of the tail is bright salmon or flesh color.

One of the five specimens has ten supralabials on one side of the head.
Habitat.—The Huachuca Mountains, southeastern Arizona. Museum of the Leland Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. W. W. Price, collector.
This interesting species has relationships with both the C. tigris and the C. lepidus, judging from the description. It seems to be quite distinct from both in the small number of labial plates and the number and size of the dorsal spots. The urosteges are more than usually divided.

Kansas. Cat. No. 4621, U.S.N.M.
Upon the top of the extremity of the muzzle there are two subtriangular shields (internasals) in contact with each. other. A large oval shield covers the region over each eye (superciliary). These shields are in contact anteriorly with the prefrontal, and forms upon each side the external shield of a cross series (postfrontals) immediately behind the prefrontals, which is usually composed of five plates. The remaining part of the upper surface of the head is covered with small subtuberculous scales.
The shields bounding the upper lip (superior labials) are from twelve to fourteen in number, the fourth or fifth the largest; those bounding the lower lip (inferior labials) thirteen to fifteen. Three rows of scales separate the eye from the superior labials. Two plates in front of the eye (preoculars), the lower usually reaching the pit in the side of the face; the upper larger and separated from the hinder of the two plates, between which the nostril is pierced (nasals) by two or more small plates (loreals). The scales of the body are in twenty-three or twenty-

five longitudinal rows, all keeled, the two rows on each side next the shields of the abdomen (gastrosteges) faintly.
The ground color above varies from bright yellowish tawny or fulvous to dark brown; beneath from whitish yellow to black gray. A light line extends from the superciliary plate to the angle of the mouth, behind which is a dark band or blotch. Upon each side of the medial dorsal line there are two series of brown or black spots. The spots of the upper or medial series are larger, rhomboid, running obliquely upward and backward. ‘They are frequently confluent across the middle line of the back anteriorly; always upon the posterior half of the body. The spots of the lower series encroach slightly upon the gastrosteges, and posteriorly unite with those of the middle series to form zigzag cross bands. Anteriorly they sometimes alternate with the central series, or rather become confluent with an indefinite alternating series, and joining the extremities of the former inclose the ground color, which thus forms a series of light spots. Of these transverse bands or rows of spots there are twenty-one, more or less, from the head to the anus. In Southwestern specimens a narrow rufous band frequently extends along the median dorsal line throughout the whole length. Tail nearly always entirely black.
This species is found from Maine to Kansas and from Louisiana to Florida.

The largest individual of this species which I have seen is from near Fort Macon, North Carolina. Its length is 5 feet and its diameter that of the full sleeve of an ordinary house coat.
This species has the widest range of all the species excepting the tropical C. durissus. It was formerly abundant in the eastern district everywhere, but it has been exterminated from the well-settled regions and is only abundant in the wilder regions. Itis not uncommon about Lake George in northern New York and in the Berkshire Hills in western Massachusetts. Thence it is to be found throughout the Alleghany Mountains to Georgia and Alabama. I have not seen a specimen from Florida.

Prof. O. P. Hay' gives the gies account of the habits of Crotalus horridus:
In its free state this species appears to inhabit wooded districts, although it may probably sometimes be found on the prairies. It especially delights in taking up its abode where there are rocks and débris, among which it can find at short notice a safe retreat. Its movements of locomotion are rather slow. When surprised, it will often seek to escape without inflicting injury on its enemy. When, however, it is pressed, or there is no time for retreat, it delivers a blow with such rapidity that the motion can hardly be followed.
Rattlesnakes do not appear to try to injure one another by biting. Indeed, Dr. Mitchell states that the poison does not affect the snakes themselves. He says that
he has over and over injected under the skin of a rattlesnake its own venom or that.
of a moccasin, or of another rattlesnake, but he had in no case seen a death. He often kept from ten to thirty-five rattlesnakes together without any of them harming the others. If a large snake were suddenly dropped on the others they would show no resentment, whereas if any other animal were thus dropped on them it would immediately get a blow. In captivity they are extremely sluggish, not moving, and for long periods refusing to accept food. Usually. after about a year without food, they will kill and eat animals. Dr. Mitchell fed his numerous specimens by putting a long funnel down their throats and pushing the food into their stomachs. They were very fond of water, and would drink large quantities of it and lie in it for hours.
They shed their skins at different times. If they did not have water, the skin would come off in patches. He says nothing about the relation of the shedding of the skin and the acquisition of new segments of the rattle. It has been noted by observers that a variable number of segments of the rattle is acquired each year, although the popular idea is that one is the number. As high as four have been observed to be added in a single year. The terminal segments, too, are constantly

ea PDS: sat
+? «00%

<<<Page: 1212>>>

being worn off, so that the number of segments present is no indication of the age of the snake.
Holbrook states that Mr. Peale, of the Philadelphia Museum, kept a living female rattlesnake for fourteen years. She had eleven rattles when she came into his possession. Several were lost annually and new ones formed. When she died, there were still eleven. During this period the snake had grown 4 inches in length.
The number of young appears to be about nine. I found this number of eggs in a female about 37 inches long, brought from Pennsylvania. The eggs were 1.5 inches long by an inch in diameter. Of these there were four in the left oviduct. There were evidences that development had begun.
Where these snakes are numerous, they are inclined to gather in considerable numbers in caverns in rocks and similar places in order to undergo their winter sleep. Such places form the rattlesnake dens about which we hear occasionally.

Rostral plate low, in form a nearly equilateral triangle: nasals two, the anterior in contact with the rostral; numerous small scales anterior to the pit. Thirteen or fourteen superior labials, the posterior small; fourteen and fifteen inferior, the second, third, and fourth in contact with the geneial. Two rows of smooth scales and the infraorbital circle separate the labials from the orbit; the scales of the former continue smooth upon the temporal region, and are larger than the labials. Scales of the body rounded, short upon the sides, especially those of the first three rows, Which, near the middle of the body, are not at all, or scarcely,

keeled. Total number of rows twenty-three, the median very strongly keeled, none rugose striate as in C. adamanteus atrox. Crepitaculum moderate, its segments diminishing in breadth toward its extremity. Gastrosteges, one hundred and sixty-six. Urosteges, twenty-three single, three pair double.
Measurements.—Total length (including crepitaculum), 29 inches 9 lines; tail, 4 inches 3 lines.
General color above light grayish brown, shaded with yellow; vertex rugous, marked with a pair of small brown spots. A light band bordered with dark crosses each superciliary plate; from the inner border of the same plate begins a chestnut brown band, which diverges from its fellow on the posterior part of the head, where it is either interrupted or continuous with a broader one which nearly joins that of the opposite side on the neck; here they are either interrupted, or continuing, unite on the neck, and form the first spot. A brown band extends from the eye to the canthus oris, involving the last labial plate, and is continued beyond, forming a spot on each side the throat. A series of about thirty-three spots are longer than broad, emarginate anteriorly and posteriorly; opposite to each is a black spot upon scales of the first, second, and third rows. The dorsal spots become broader, resembling transverse rhombs, with light borders outside the black; the lateral angles become confluent with the lateral black spots, forming vertical black bands on the sides. They finally assume the form of transverse brown bands. The tail is crossed by five of these, upon a brown ground. Beneath yellow; tips of many of the gastrosteges blackish. Inhabits Lower California, whence specimens have been sent to the Philadelphia Academy and Smithsonian Institution by Mr. John Xantus. Type 4663. Xantus collection.
This species bears considerable resemblance to CO. molossus in its style of coloration, and, like it, is a beautiful animal. The latter species is scutellated upon the muzzle, as in OC. durissus, the rows of scales are more numerous than in C. enyo, and it is without the head stripes.

Fig. 344, CROTALUS LEPIDUS KENNICOTT. —ils Rio Grande, Texas.
Head ovoid, tapering to the nose, which is narrow, pointed, and depressed. Nostril small, circular, and placed near the point of the nose in about the middle of a nasal plate, which is usually only divided from the nostril downward. Two elongated internasals in contact, extending behind the nostrils. Superciliaries and other large plates smooth. Rostral subtriangular, broader than high, the apex turned back slightly upon the crown. Upper preorbital small and separated from the postnasal by the width of two larger loreal plates. Labials rather large, twelve above, ten to twelve below. Color of head yellowish ash.
The head is much depressed, the general outline ovoid, tapering regularly from about opposite the angle of the mouth to the nose. The crown is remarkably smooth and the occipital scales are very faintly carinated. There are two large internasals elongated laterally and posteriorly, with their inner ends in contact. They are convex on their external and concave on their internal edges, and extend for nearly half their length back of the nostril. Behind and fitting into the emargination formed by these are two -subquadrangular and smaller plates in contact. Immediately behind these is another similar pair. On each side of these last two pairs, at the edge of the crown, between the superciliaries and anterior frontals, is a larger plate. The superciliaries are rather small, and, like the other larger plates, quite smooth; the space between the superciliaries is quite narrow and filled with three rows of irregular large scales; the posterior part of the crown is also covered with rather large and smooth scales. The lower preorbital

<<<Page: 1215>>>

is, as usual, small and elongated over the pit, but the upper, very small and quadrangular, is separated from the nasal by two plates, each larger than itself. In all the other species the upper preorbital is large, more or less elongated, and in contact with the postnasal or only separated from it by the width of one smaller plate. The suborbital chain is complete, and there is only a single row of scales between that and the labials. The color of the head is uniform yellowish or light brownish ash without any distinct spots or stripes, though each plate is minutely mottled with brownish and with a few scattering black dots, and there is a very faint indication of the usual posterior facial stripe extending over the angle of the mouth.
It will be at once distinguished from C. tigris by the single nasal, number of loreals, number and comparative size of labials, and number of rows between the suborbitals and labials, and by the narrow, pointed nose instead of the broad, blunt snout of C. tigris. It disagrees also with C. c. lucifer in all of the above characters excepting the size of labials and the narrow nose, and differs widely from that species in the depressed snout, wide rostral, and perfectly smooth plates and scales on the head. By the smoothness and size of the plates and absence of the horn it will be at once distinguished from C. cerastes. It will be impossible to confound it with any of the Eastern species.
The color above is a greenish gray, which is crossed by nineteen jetblack rings on the body, which do not extend on the abdomen. These rings are two and a half scales wide on the middle line and narrow downward on each side, so as to cover but one scale in width. The scales which border the annuli are half black and half green, the effect of which is to give the edge of the ring a turreted outline. The edges of the ground color are paler than any other part of the scales, thus throwing the black into greater relief. A large black spot, shaped like two hearts side by side, with the apices posterior, marks the nape, and there is an irregular small black spot on each side of the occiput; some black specks between the orbits; no other marks on the head. Near the middle of the gray spaces of the body some of the scales of many of the rows have black tips. The tail is light brown above and has a basal broad black and two other narrow brown annuli. Below dirty white, with closely placed shades of brown. :
The following specimen is in the museum of the University of Kansas, and is from the Magdalena Mountains, New Mexico. It furnishes the following data: Rows of scales, 23; upper labials, 12; gastrosteges, 153; urosteges, 27; total length, 555 mm. ; rattle, 74 mm.
In the typical specimens the nasal plates are not divided. In three specimens since received the plates are separated from the nostril downward. In two specimens the cross-bands are uninterrupted. On two others (from Fort Huachuca, Arizona) the bands are broken at the ends on the sides, along the middle of the length, giving rise to a row of lateral spots. In both the tail is salmon color, with two dark cross bands.

This is a peculiarly handsome species and is the only one to which the term “green rattlesnake” can be correctly applied. In the arrangement of its dark colors it approaches nearer to the C. horridus of the East than any other form. In the arrangement of its head scales it approaches the C. polystictus.

In this species the subdivision of the lead scales is carried further than in any other. The rostral is separated from the nasal by one or two series of scales, and there are from two to five loreals, the posterior two representing the anterior parts of the preoculars of other species. There is no distinct canthus rostralis, and the scales of its external border are identical in character with those that separate them on the median part of the muzzle and front. All of these scales are rather small and are striate. Six to eight rows separate the superciliaries. The latter have a strongly convex external border. The muzzle is short and wide, and the nostrils are somewhat vertical in position. Three rows of scales separate the orbit from the labials. Superior and inferior labials both fifteen, the first inferior divided transversely, so that the postsymplhyseal part is a separate element. The symphyseals taken together cordiform; rostral a triangle, a little wider than high. The seales of the body are in twenty-three to twenty-five rows and are rather obtuse. ‘They differ little in size, except that the median five or six rows are narrower. All are rather weakly keeled except the two exterior. They are in addition finely striate ridged toward the base. The rattle of the type specimen displays eight joints and a button.
The color above and below is grayish yellow. The upper surface of the head is shaded, that of the body coarsely and densely punctulated with brown. The irregular aggregation and deepness of these punctu

lations form a series of about forty-two dorsal spots. These are transverse, with produced lateral angles, extending across twelve rows of scales from angle to angle, separated from the adjacent ones by a bright band of ground color one and a half scales wide. On the posterior fourth of the total length they form brown cross bands. Five upon the tail are black on very light ground, asin C. a. atrox. Anteriorly there is an ill-defined series of spots, which are opposite those of the dorsal line. A yellow band extends from the nasal plates anterior to the eye, involving from the ninth to the last superior labial. Superior to this is a brown band extending from the eye and ceasing on a line with the angle of the mouth. Some indistinct brown marks on the top of the head are arranged as follows: One on the inner border of each superciliary; three posterior to these, the median short and broad; four further posterior, the median pair longer, diverging, reaching the neck.

The typical specimen from which this species was described was taken at Cape St. Lucas. A specimen from Arizona which subsequently came to hand differed so widely in squamation and color that I referred it to a distinct species under the name of C. pyrrhus. Thus, while the Cape St. Lucas specimen had two loreals, the Arizona animal had four, and while the Cape St. Lucas snake was pale gray, with scarcely discernible dorsal spots, the Arizonian was red, with dark-red quadrate dorsal spots. Dr. Stejneger subsequently observed that specimens from California, in about the latitude of the Arizonian locality, had the color of the Cape St. Lucas specimen, and that the number of loreals was not constant. Still later Mr. Van Denburgh, of the California Academy of Sciences, has shown that the number of loreal

row of large spots of a mahogany red, which are quadrate on the anterior part of the body, become transversely hexagonal, then lenticular, and finally form cross-bands. There are thirty-two such spots on the body, and six annuli on the tail, which are interrupted by the urosteges below. These are of the same color as those of the back, except the last three, which are nearly black. Inferior surfaces light salmon color. The ends of the gastrosteges are marked with alternate blotches of yellow and mahogany, each covering the extremity of one or two scuta. There are no distinct color marks on the head, but the lips are lighter. Formula:

only separated from prenasal below the nostril, and from preocular by a large loreal. Three rows of scales below orbit. Scales on top of muzzle smooth, four on each side larger than the others, two bordering the nasals above, and two smaller ones bordering the superciliary in front. Scales between superciliaries small, in five rows. Those behind them and on the cheek keeled. External border of the superciliary plate produced, sometimes considerably to an obtuse apex, which is grooved longitudinally below. Scales of the body strongly keeled, except the two inferior rows, which are smooth.
General color light yellowish or brownish gray above, dirty white below. The upper surface is crossed by a median series of transverse brown hexagons, the color marked with numerous black punctulations. Opposite the lateral apices of these, on the fourth row of scales, is a small spot of the same color, and between these, on the first and second rows, and the end of the adjacent gastrostege is a rather larger

dusky spot. None of these spots have dark or light borders except the median series, which are narrowly black edged anteriorly and posteriorly on the middle part. The dorsal bands increase in relative transverse diameter on the posterior part of the body, but it is only on the tail, and a part of the body of equal length anterior to it that they extend, that they are united with the lateral spots. The extremities of the gastrosteges are shaded opposite the lateral and median spots, but they are elsewhere unspotted. The head is in the specimens in alcohol without markings on the pale ground color, excepting a dusky postorbital band, which passes above the rictus of the mouth. The space anterior to it, and below the eye, as far as the maxillary fossa, is very light colored, probably yellow in life. The superior border of the postorbital band is not defined; the inferior border is marked with some small black spots.

We have but few specimens of this species, five only having come
under my observation. It is neazest the C. tigris Kennicott, but has
even fewer scales on the body, presenting the smallest number known in the genus. The labial plates are fewer, and the gastrosteges materially less numerous (28). The partial fusion of the nasal plates is also characteristic of the C. cerastes as of the C. lepidus.
A small rattlesnake has been long known to the Arizonians as the ‘‘sidewinder,” from its habit of progressing sidewise instead of in the usual way. It has been ascertained by Dr. J. L. Wortman that the species which possesses this peculiarity is the Crotalus cerastes. During an ethnological exploration of the valley of the Salt River, a tributary of the Gila, in Arizona, he frequently observed the snake and its habits.
In his report on the results of the Death Valley expedition Dr. Merriam gives the distribution and habits of this species as follows:
The horned rattlesnake, or ‘‘sidewinder,” as it is locally known throughout the region it inhabits, is the characteristic snake of the Lower Sonoran deserts of the Great Basin, from southern California easterly across southern Nevada to Arizona and southwestern Utah. It inhabits the open deserts, while its congener of the same region (C. tigris) lives in the desert ranges. Its local name is derived from its peculiar mode of progression. When disturbed it moves away sideways, keeping its broadside toward the observer instead of proceeding in the usual serpentine manner. Its bite is said to be fatal, which is probably not the case under ordinary
circumstances. A large number were secured by the expedition, and many others
were killed, but no one was bitten by it. It was found on both sides of Pilot Knob, in the Mohave Desert (April 5 and 6); in Pahrump Valley, where four were caught ina space of a mile and a half (April 28 and 29); in Veyas Valley (May 1); in Vegas Wash (May 3); in Indian Spring Valley (May 29), where one was shot containing a kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) and two pocket mice (Perognathus); in the Amargosa Desert (May 31), and in Sarcobatus Flat (June 2). It was common in the valley of the Virgin and Lower Muddy (May 6 and 7), and was said to inhabit Pahranagat Valley, though we did not find it there.
During the latter part of April and the early part of May these rattlesnakes were often found in pairs, and were doubtless mating. At such times they remained out in plain sight over night instead of retreating to holes or shelter under desert brush, and on two occasions they were found by us on cold mornings so early that they were too chilled to move until considerably disturbed. I stepped on one of these by accident as it lay in a compact coil with its head in the center, but it was held so firmly by my weight that it was unable to strike. A moment before, I had killed its mate. I killed three on the mesa east of St. Joe, in the valley of the Muddy, in eastern Nevada, May 7.

As is well known, the aggregates of organic beings called faunze and floree correspond in part with the natural land divisions of the earth’s surface, but not exactly. The first classification of the primary faunz was proposed by Dr. P. L. Sclater in 1858, as follows:
1. Palearctic.—Europe, Northern Africa, Northern and Central Asia.
2. Ethiopian.—Africa south of the Great Desert, and Madagascar.
3. Indian.—Southeastern Asia and the Malay Archipelago.
4. Australian.—Australia with New Guinea and the adjacent islands, New Zealand, and Polynesia.
5. Nearctic.—North America as far south as Mexico.
6. Neotropical.—Central and South America and the West Indies.
Subsequently Dr. A. R. Wallace proposed that the name Oriental be used in place of Indian.
In 1868 Prof. T. H. Huxley proposed that the world’s areas be arranged in two divisions, Arctogeea and Notogwea; the former including the Palearctic, Indian, Ethiopian, and Nearctic of Sclater, and the latter

<<<Page: 1223>>>

including the Australian and Neotropical regions. To the last two he added the Novo-Zealanian for New Zealand, and he proposed to change the name of the Neotropical to Austrocolumbian.
In 1871 Dr. J. A. Allen proposed the following faunal divisions: I. Arctic Realm; Il. North Temperate Realm; III. American Tropical Realm; IV. Indo-African Tropical Realm; V. South American Temperate Realm; VI. African Temperate Realm; VII. Antarctic Realm; VIII. Australian Realm.
In 1874 Sclater modified his system as follows: He retained the term Arctogea in the Huxleyan sense. To the Neotropical region he gaye the name of Dendrogiea, and to the Australian he gave the name of Antarctogea, omitting New Zealand and Polynesia, which he constituted a fourth division, Ornithogiea.
In 1878 Heilprin proposed the name Holarctic to include Sclater’s Palearctic and Nearctic regions. He also proposed two transitional regions; that of the Old World he called Mediterranean and that of the New World the Sonoran, the latter a term already introduced by Cope for a division of the Nearctic of Sclater.
In 1884 Gill proposed the following primary divisions or realms: 1, Anglogwean (North American); 2, Eurygeean, or Eurasian; 3, Indo gean; 4, Afrogean; 5, Dendrogean, or Tropical American; 6, Amphigean, or Temperate South American; 7, Austrogean, or Australian; 8, Ornithogean, or New Zealand; 9, Nesogzean, or Polynesian. Profascr Gill justly insisted on pie importance of fresh-water fishes as furnishing definitions of natural faunal realms and regions.
In 1890 Blanford published a system of geographic zoology in which he adopted the primary divisions of Huxley, and divided the Arctogean region into the following: Malagasy, Ethiopian, Oriental, Aqui-
lonian (—Palearctic and northern part of Nearctic), and Medio-
Columbian (southern part of Nearctic).
In 1896 Lydekker proposed the following divisions: I. Notogzie Realm; regions: 1, Australian; 2, Polynesian; 3, Hawaiian; 4, Austromalayan. II. Neogeiec Realm; region, Neotropical. III. Arctogezic Realm; regions: 1, Malagasy; 2, Ethiopian; 3, Oriental; 4, Holarctie; 5, Sonoran. Lydekker makes use of paleontologic evidence in this connection. While this treatment of the subject is important from the point of view of origin, 1t is often irrelevant, since the distribution of vertebrate life in each geologic age was different from that in each other geologic age.
In an essay on the geographical distribution of North American Reptilia published in 1875, the present writer adopted the first system of Sclater. After a lapse of twenty years, the light thrown on the sub ject by various investigators suggests the following modifications: In the first place the recognition of the close similarity of the life of the northern regions of the earth, requires more definite formulation than was accorded it in Sclater’s first system, by the union of his three divi-

<<<Page: 1224>>>

sions of Nearctic, Palearctic, and Indian into one, for which the name Arctogea is appropriate. The inclosure of his Ethiopian division in it, aS proposed by Huxley, does not seem to me to be proper, in view of the important types of fishes and reptiles which characterize it; for instance, the Crossopterygian, Dipnoan, and Scyphophorous fishes, and the Pleurodire tortoises. In the fishes, indeed, the Ethiopian region has as much affinity with the Neotropical fauna as with any other, in its Characinid and Cichlid families, and in the Dipnoan subclass. The presence of the Dipnoiand the Pleurodire tortoises allies it to the Australian fauna as well. It is for these reasons that Professor Gill proposes to combine the southern hemisphere realms into a single ‘“ Kogan” division. The northern aftinities of the Ethiopian Realm are, however, too many to permit us to regard this arrangement as a just expression of the facts. Thus, it has Inseetivorous Mammalia, Firmisternial Anura, and Cyprinid fishes, none of which are Australian or Neotropical types. The course that remains under the circumstances is toregard the Ethiopian Realm as fully distinct from the other three. The definitions of the four primary divisions are then as follows:
The Australian Realm is peculiar in the absence of nearly all types of Mammalia, except the Ornithodelphia and the marsupials; in the presence of various Ratite birds, in great development of the Proteroglyph serpents, and absence of the higher division of both snakes and frogs (that is, Solenoglypha and Firmisternia); in the existence of Dipnoi (Ceratodus) and certain [sospondylous families of fishes. On the other hand, many of the lizards and birds are of the higher types that prevail in India and Africa, namely, the Agamide and the Oscines.
The Neotropical Realm only possesses exclusively the Platyrhine monkeys and the great majority of the humming birds. It shares with the other southern regions the Edentate and Tapiroid mammals; Ratite, Pullastrine, and Clamatorial birds; Proteroglyph snakes; Iguanid Sauria, the Agamids being entirely absent; Arciterous frogs; and Characinid, Chromid, Osteoglossid, and Dipnoan fishes. It has but few types of the northern regions; these are a few bears, deer, and oscine birds. Insectivorous Mammalia, Viperid serpents, and Ginglymodous, Halecomorphous, and Cyprinid fishes are wanting, except on the northern border.
The Ethiopian Realm is that one which combines the prevalent features of the Arctogzean Realm with the southern hemisphere types already mentioned, together with some found elsewhere only in the Indian region, and avery few peculiar. The two latter classes not being mentioned elsewhere, they may be here enumerated. This region shares, with the Indian alone, the Catarrhine monkeys, the Elephantide, Rhinocerotide, Nomarthrous Edentata, and Chameleons. Its peculiar types are the Lemuride, Hippopotamidze, and Protelidie, Cryptoproctide, and Hyracoidea among mammals, and Polypteridse and Mormyridie among fishes. It possesses in common with the Neotropical Realm Characinid, Cichlid,

and Dipnoan fishes, Pleurodire tortoises, and Ratite and Trogonoid birds; and differs from it in the absence of Arciferous Batrachia and Crotalid snakes, and presence of Dendraspid, Causid, meds and Viperid snakes.
The Arctogean Realm is characterized by the absence of types conspicuous elsewhere, and by the presence of a few peculiar forms. Among fishes it lacks Dipnoi and Crossopterygia, Osteoglossidx, Characinide, and Cichlid. It lacks Pleurodire tortoises and Ratite birds. Ginglymodous fishes and Urodele Batrachia are nearly confined to it, merely extending a little over the border of the Neotropical. Its Cryptodire tortoises extend both into the Neotropical and Ethiopian. Anguid lizards are confined to it. It shares most of its Mammalia with other regions. The Insectivora it shares with the Ethiopian, and its deer and camels with the Neotropical. The genus Ursus is very characteristic, one aberrant species only extending into the Neotropical.
From what has preceded it is seen that the primary differences between the faunz of the realms are to be found to a large degree in the lower Vertebrata, the fishes, Batrachia, and Reptilia. These forms furnish stronger distinctions than the birds and mammals, owing to their greater inability to traverse natural boundaries. Neglect of these indications has led to much of the difference of opinion in the question of geographical distribution, which has been founded principally on
the conditions presented by the birds and Mammalia. .
In this system fragments of existing or old continents, which have been subjected to conditions unfavorable to particular forms of life otherwise prevalent in them, are, as in the system of Sclater, disregarded. Thus, islands generally are not regarded as presenting conditions definitive of divisions of the first rank, as was done by Huxley and Gill in the case of New Zealand, and Gill and Lydekker in the Polynesian Islands. The temperate regions of Africa and South America are certainly not separable from the tropical portions as divisions of primary rank, as was done by Allen, who is followed as to South America by Gill. With equal propriety western North America might be separated from Mississippi and Atlantic North America, on account of the great deficiency of its fish fauna, In estimating faunistic affinities one has to give similarities over a given area more weight than differences, where the differences are only due to absence of types.
Finally, it must be remembered that there are geographic points of transition between all the realms.
This realm includes three regions, namely, the Indian, the Holarctic, and the Medicolumbian. I have already defined the first two in general terms. The third is the Transitional of Heilprin, the Sonoran of Merriam and Lydekker, and the Neotemperate of Townsend. It embraces what is left of the Nearctic of Sclater after the subtraction

<<<Page: 1226>>>

of the Holaretic. As the name Sonoran has been previously given by me to one of the districts of this region, | have preferred to use for it the name given by Blanford.
The faunal characteristics of these regions may be enumerated as follows:
Indian Region.—Presence of Holostomatous fishes. Absence of Ginglymodous, Halecomorphous, and Salmonid fishes. Presence of Creciliid Batrachia. Absence of Trachystomatous, Amphiumid, Cryptobranchid, and Arciferous Batrachia. Presence of Agamid lizards, and Angiostomatous and Viperid snakes. lresence of Phasianid, Kurylemid, Nectariniid, and Pittid birds. Absence of Tyrannid and of several nine-quilled oscine families. Presence of Nomarthrous Kdentata, of Viverridie, Hywnide, Tupieiidie, and Tarsiidie. Presence of Rhinocerotidie, Tapiridie, Proboseidia, Catarrhine (uadrumana, and Anthropomorpha. Absence of Didelphyide, Procyonidiw, and Scalopide.
Holaretic Region.—Absence of Holostomatous and Halecomorphous fishes. Presence of Ginglymodous and Salmonid fishes. Absence of Trachystomatous, Amphiumid, and Cieciliid Batrachia, and absence of the Arcifera, except the family Discoglossidie (two species of Hyla excepted). Absence of Angiostomatous and presence of Viperid snakes. Presence of Phasianid, and absence of Euryliemid, Nectariniid, Pittid, and Tyrannid birds, and of several nine quilled oscine families or subfamilies. Absence of Nomarthrous Kdentata, of Viverride, Hyenide, Tupeiide, Rhinocerotidie, Tapiride, Proboscidia, Quadrumana, and Anthropomorpha (except Homo).
Medicolumbian Region.—Absence of Holostomatous fishes; presence of Ginglymodous and Halecomorphous fishes. Presence of Trachystomatous, Amphiumid, Arciferous, and lirmisternial Batrachia, and absence of Creciliidee. Presence of Iguanid, and absence of Agamid and Chamieleonid lizards; absence (except three species) of Angiostomatous and of Viperid snakes. Absence of the Indian types of Passeres mentioned, and presence of Tyrannid Clamatores, and several groups of nine-quilled Oscines (Icteridie, Mniotiltide, Tanagridie). Absence of all the specially Indian Mammalia, and of the Holaretie Erinaceid, and presence of Didelphyidie (one species), Talpidie, and Procyonide.
In defining these regions I have restricted myself necessarily to types of tolerably high rank, and have not referred to species. This is because species are not generally characteristic of entire divisions, but only of parts of them. One can not, however, be absolutely exact in such major definitions, since a number of the conspicuous types in each are not universally distributed over these areas.
In comparing the Holarctie with other realms, I have already referred to the number of types which it possesses in common with the Ethiopian, not found in the Neotropical. It has also several in common

<<<Page: 1227>>>

with the Neotropical, which do not occur in the Ethiopian. These are the Arciferous Batrachia, the Crotalid snakes, and the deer (Cervide). The Medicolumbian division of the Holarctic shares other forms with the Neotropical. These are Didelphyidz and Procyonide among Mammalia; Tyrannid, Icterid, and Tanagrid birds; Cinosternid tortoises, and the Arciferous Batrachian family Hylide.
Some of the forms of the Holarctic region are not uniformly dis tributed over it. Thus the Ginglymodous and Polyodontid fishes only occur in the eastern parts of the eastern and western continents. The same is true of the Siluroid genus Ameiurus and the Loricate genus Alligator. The Crotalid snakes are not found in the western part of Eurasia. The Batrachian Cryptobranchid have the same distribution.
This region was formerly included in the Nearctic of Sclater, and the area thus constituted has the following geographic boundaries: To the south it includes the plateau of Mexico, including the central valley. The Neotropical area bounds it to the east and west, occupying the lowlands, or Tierra Caliente, to a point 150 miles south of the Rio Grande on the east,' and to Mazatlan, or some point not far from it, on the west. The high land of Oaxaca is its extreme southern outpost. Its northern boundary is thus described by Merriam: ’
The Boreal (Holaretic realm) Province extends obliquely across the entire continent from New England and Newfoundland to Alaska, conforming in direction to the trend of the northern shores of the continent. It gives off three long arms or chains of islands which reach far south along the three great mountain systems of the United States, a western arm in the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, a central arm in the Rocky Mountains, and an eastern arm in the Alleghanies, and these interdigitate with northward prolongations of the Sonoran (Medicolumbian) province, which latter completely surrounds the southern islands of the Boreal (Holarctic) system.
The faunal relations of the Medicolumbian realm may be tabulated ~ as follows:

Baird! divided this region into three districts, which he termed the Eastern, Central, and Western. The Eastern occupied eastern North America to the central plains, where they exceed 800 feet above sea level. The Western included the territory between the Caseade and Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. In my paper of 18752 I adopted the Eastern, Central, and Western districts (calling the last the Pacific), and proposed two other districts, namely, the Austroriparian for the Louisianian division of the eastern of Verrill, and the Sonoran for the southwestern and Mexican Plateau faune. Merriam,* in 1890, proposed a different arrangement. Using the name Sonoran for the entire Medicolumbian Region, he divided it into—
(1) an Arid or Sonoran subregion proper, occupying the table-land of Mexico, reaching north into western Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and southern California; (2) a Californian subregion, occupying the greater part of the State of that name; (3) a Lower Californian subregion; (4) a Great Basin subregion, occupying the area between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, extending as far north as the plains of the Columbia; (5) a Great Plains subregion, occupying the plains east of the Rocky Mountains, and extending north to the plains of the Saskatchewan; and (6) a Louisianian or Austroriparian subregion, occupying the lowlands bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi, and extending eastward south of the Alleghanies to the Atlantic seaboard where it reaches as far north as the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.
According to his arrangement the Eastern region of Baird and myself is not mentioned,
This classification may be applicable to birds and mammals; but it is not applicable to the fishes, batrachia, and reptilia, which are much more exact indicators of the histories of fauns, owing to their inferior powers of migration. The eastern district or subregion is more nearly allied, from this point of view, to the Austroriparian than the latter is to the Sonoran proper, or arid region. This is due, as Baird previ-

ously pointed out, to the great difference in rainfall between the part of the continent lying eastward of the one-hundredth meridian aiid that part which lies west of it. This difference is coincident with a profound difference in geologic age between the regions west of that meridian and the eastern district, the former having a short continental history as compared with the latter.
I, however, agree with Merriam in the abolition of the “Central” as a subregion of Medicolumbia.
The relation of the several zoological divisions to these subregions are as follows: The eastern subregion is the original center of distribution of all the fishes peculiar to the Medicolumbian region, except only the Plagopterine Cyprinide. It is the center of distribution of all the Batrachia, with the following exceptions: The degenerate types of Trachystomata and Amphiumid probably originated in the Austroriparian subregion, and the species of ufo in the Sonoran. The eastern subregion is also the source of the aquatic Testudinata. On the other hand the Sauria of the eastern and Austroriparian subregions are an overflow from the abundant lizard life of the Sonoran 1egion, excepting the family of the skinks, and the genus Anolis, the latter
being of Neotropical origin. The snakes also are mainly Sonoran .
types, including especially the true rattlesnakes. The copperheads and ground rattlesnakes are on the contrary indigenous to the eastern subregion. The Pacific subregion has close affinities with the Sonoran, but of a largely different kind as to its lizards, while the Batrachia have the character of the eastern types as far as they go.
The distribution of types indicates six principal subdivisions, which I call the Floridan, Austroriparian, Eastern, Sonoran, Western, and Toltecan subregions. The Floridan subregion includes the greater part of the peninsula of Florida, being bounded approximately on the west by the Suwanee River. The Austroriparian subregion extends northward from the Guif of Mexico to the isothermal of 77° F. It begins near Norfolk, Virginia, and occupies a belt along the coast, extending inland in North Carolina. It passes south of the Georgia mountains, and to the northwestward up the Mississippi Valley to the southeastern part of Illinois. West of the Mississippi the boundary crosses Missouri, extends south along the southern boundary of high lands of Texas, and reaches the Gulf at the mouth of the Rio Grande. The Eastern subregion is the most extended, reaching from the isothermal line of 77° F. north and from the Atlantic Ocean to the elevati d plains west of the Mississippi River. Many of its forms extend up tle bottoms of the rivers which flow to the eastward through the plains. The Sonoran subregion extends from the limit of the Eastern as far west as the Sierra Nevada, and south, including Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Sonora, and the Plateau of Mexico, including the State of Chihuahua, and, perhaps, Durango. It does not cross the Sierra Nevada, but includes the entire peninsula of Lower California. It extends north-

<<<Page: 1230>>>

ward on the east side of the Sierra Nevada as far as, including the arid region of British Columbia. It occupies the valley of the Rio Grande, and extends into Texas as far as the Rio Pecos. It extends southward in western Mexico as far as Mazatlan. The Western subregion extends from the Pacific coast to the Sierra Nevada to an uncertain distance on the Lower Californian peninsula. At the north it crosses the Sierra Nevada, skips the narrow strip of the Sonoran in Washington, and extends to the Roeky Mountains, including northern Idaho and western Montana. The Voltecan subregion includes the States of Guanajuato, Mexico, and the adjacent elevated regions of Michoacan, Oaxaca, and Puebla, including the Alpine regions of the southern Sierra Madre. It is probable that another subregion should be added, the Tamaulipan of Townsend. This is a dry region extending from near the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Rio Soto la Marina, in the State of Tamaulipas. More information regarding the fauna of this country is desirable.
The faunal peculiarities of these subregions are well marked. The three subregions included in eastern North America differ from all the others in the abundance of their turtles and the small number of their lizards. Prolific of life, this area is not subdivided by any marked natural barriers. Hence, though its species present great varieties in extent of range, it is not divided into districts which are very sharply defined. The warmer regions are much richer in birds, reptiles, and insects than the cooler; and as we advance northward many species disappear, while a few others aré added. The natural division of the eastern part of the continent is then in a measure dependent on the isothermal lines which traverse it, which accord also quite closely with its geologic history.
The Floridan subregion is distinguished by the presence of several peculiar genera of Batrachia and Reptilia, and by a number of peculiar species. A special feature is the almost total absence of Batrachia Urodela. The genera are:
BATRACHIA. Lithodytes. Pseudobranchus.
Stilosoma. Rhadinea.
Seminatria. Liodytes. SAURIA.
Rhineura. Spharodactylus.
Lithodytes and Spherodactylus are West Indian Neotropical genera, and Rhadinwa, besides being Neotropical, extends into the eastern part of the Austroriparian subregion. Five genera are then peculiar. The

<<<Page: 1231>>>

peculiar species will be enumerated later. Several species of mammals are confined to this subregion. The genera of birds that do not range north of it are, according to Allen:
Certhiola. Aramus
: : , | Waders.
Zenaida Audubonia
Oreopelia Pigeons. Phoenicopterus.
Star nenas Hatliplana lq erns.
Rostrhamus Anous {
Polyborus ephones The isolation of the Floridan subregion is due to the fact that the nucleus of the peninsula (which is of Kocene age) was separated from the continent during the greater part of Neocene time. If at any time connected with the Antilles, the period was of short duration.
The Austroriparian subregion possesses many peculiar geuera of reptiles not found elsewhere, while the region north of it possesses none, its genera being distributed over some or all of the remaining regions. The number of peculiar species in all departments of animal life is large. It presents the greatest development of the eastern reptile life. Sixteen genera of Reptiles and eight of Batrachia do not range to the northward, while ninety-nine species are restricted in the same manner. The peculiar genera which occur over most of its area are:
SAURIA. TESTUDINATA. Anolis. Macrochelys.
SERPENTES. ' LORICATA. Hlaps. Alligator. Haldea. BATRACHIA. Cemophora. EHngystoma, Tantilla. Manculus. Compsosoma. Amphiuma. Farancia. Siren.
I have omitted from this list ten genera which are restricted to one or the other of its subdivisions. Siren, Cemophora, Anolis, and Alligator are the most striking of the above characteristic genera. No genus of lizards is peculiar excepting Anolis, which has its greatest development in other than the Nearctic continent. Among serpents a few genera of Neotropical character extend eastward along the region of the Mexican Gulf, as far as the Atlantic coast, which are not found in any of the northern regions; such are Compsosoma (Central American), Tantilla, and Elaps (Sonoran). On the other hand, Abastor, Virginia, Haldea, and Storeria embrace serpents whee it shares with the Kastern region.
This region is the headquarters of the Bone tae especially of the

tailed forms. The majority of species of the tailless genera are found here, especially of Hyla (tree toads), Rana, and Chorophilus.
There are no less than nine genera of birds which do not, or only accidentally, range northward of this district. They are, according to Allen:
Plotus. Conurus. Tantalus. Chamepelia. Platalea. Campephilus. Blanus. Helinea., Tetinia.
All these genera, excepting the last, range into South America or further.
Among mammals, but few species and one genus (Sigmodon) are confined to it. Lepus aquaticus and L. palustris, the cotton rat, ete., and a few others, are restricted by it. The fish fauna is very similar to that of the Eastern region.
The Hastern subregion ditfers from the Austroriparian almost entirely in what it lacks, and agrees with it in all those peculiarities by which it is so widely separated from the Sonoran subregion. No genus of mammals is found in it which does not range into other regions, excepting the Insectivorous genera Parascalops and Condylura (star-nosed mole) ; but numerous species are confined to it, not extending into the Austroriparian. These number from twenty to twenty-five. Among birds, the following genera are, according to J. A. Allen, shared with the more southern region only: Quiscalus, Siurus, Helmitherus, Protonotaria, Parula, Mniotilta. No genus of Reptiles, and but one of Batrachians (Gyrinophilus), is contined to this region; but it shares all it possesses with the Austroriparian. It has but four genera of lizards, namely, Sceloporus, Cnemidophorus, Liolepisma, and Humeces.
The Sonoran subregion is characterized in the lower vertebrate fauna by great poverty in fishes, batrachians, and tortoises, and abundance of lizards and snakes. Among fishes it lacks the orders Ginglymodi, Halecomorphi, and Chondrostei, and possesses only one peculiar group, the Plagopterine, a division of the Cyprinidie. Of usual Holaretie types it possesses only [sospondyli (Salmonidie) and Plectospondyli; Percomorphi and Nematognathi being absent. The rivers that intersect its central district contain these types, but they must be reckoned as belonging with their bottom lands to the Eastern subregion; the high plains only belonging to the Sonoran. The true drainage area of the Sonoran subregion is that of the Colorado.
No genus of Batrachia is peculiar to it, and the following divisions are wanting: Proteida, Trachystomata, Amphiumoidea, and all Urodela, except Amblystomidie (one species). The genus Bufo is the only one that is well represented,

<<<Page: 1233>>>

The following genera of reptiles are peculiar to it:
Uta. Anota.
Uma. Lichanura. Sauromalus. Phyllorhynchus. Callisaurus. Chionactis. Dipsosaurus. Chilomeniscus.
It shares the following genera with the Toltecan subregion and the Central American subregion of the Neotropical Realm only: Ctenosaura. Eublepharis (also in the Indian region). Phyllodactylus (also in the Columbian Neotropical). Heloderma, Hypsiglena. Salvadora. Rhinechis (also Holarctic of Eurasia), Chionactis. Trimorphodon. Tantilla (also in Brazilian Neotropical). Cinosternum (also in Brazilian Neotropical). The following genera of the Sonoran subregion enter the Texan district of the Austroriparian subregion :
Holbrookia. Hypsiglena. Crotaphytus. Rhinochilus. Phrynosoma. Cinosternum. Gerrhonotus.
Many species are peculiar to this subregion, as will be shown later on.
The Western subregion is distinguished by the absence of most of the types of fishes of the humid part of the continent, and the presence of a few. Thus, the Ginglymodi, Ilalecomorphi, and Catostomid are absent, while Percomorphi are present. The Batrachian fauna lacks the Proteida, Trachystomata, and Amphiumoidea, while Urodela are abundant, excepting Cryptobranchide. All the families of Salientia characteristic of Medicolumbia are present except the Engystomide. Among reptiles the genus Charina is entirely characteristic, and Gerrhonotus of the Toltecan and Sonoran fauna ranges its entire length. It is especially distinguished by the absence of the following genera: First, all of the Iguanidz exclusively characteristic of the Sonoran fauna, there remaining only Crotaphytus, Sceloporus, and Phrynosoma, which also enter the Texan district of the Austroriparian; by the absence of Heloderma, Ophisaurus, and Liolepisma. Among snakes, by the absence of true water snakes (genus Natrix), and the small burrowing Natricinz of Opisthoglyph forms, and of poisonous snakes of the genera Elaps and Sistrurus. No genus but Charina can be cited as of universal distribution, which is not at the same time found in some other subre-

gion; but several genera occur in one or the other of its districts which do not occur elsewhere. Similarly, no genus of birds or mammals can be exclusively assigned to its entire area; but Chamea otf the former class and Haplodontia of the latter are restricted to particular portions of it.
The Toltecan subregion is characterized by the genera it lacks as well as those which it possesses. Thus, it lacks all the genera of Sauria above cited as characteristic of the Sonoran subregion, including those enumerated as passing over into the Austroriparian except Phrynosoma. It also lacks the following genera of snakes which are found in the Sonoran:
Lichanura. Chilomeniscus. Pityophis. ; Zamenis, Ophibolus. Phyllorhynchus.
From the Austroriparian subregion it differs in the lack of all the humerous genera of fishes and Batrachia Urodela, which characterize it, excepting only Spelerpes. It lacks also the following genera of snakes: Cyclpphis, Virginia, Haldea, and Carphophiops; and Natrix is very sparsely if at all represented.
In its positive characters the Toltecan subregion combines certain forms of both the Sonoran and Austroriparian subregions. Of the former character are Spea, Phrynosoma, Barissia, Gerrhonatus, Hypsiglena, and Salvadora; of the latter kind, Spelerpes, Liolepisma, Osceola, Storeria, and Sistrurus. Characteristic of Medicolumbia generally: Amblystoma, Rana, Sceloporus, Humeces, Diadophis, Eutenia, Crotalus, Peculiar genera.
Stiredon. Conopsis. Thorius. Epiglottophis. Malachylodes. Ophryacus.
Neotropical genera: Gidipus, Anolis, Celestus, Atractus, Ninia, Drymobius, Bothriechis.
The fauna of Batrachia and Reptilia of this subregion is characterized by what it lacks as much as by what it possesses. The namber of species which occupy its entire extent exclusively of other subregions is small, while a larger number are restricted to parts of it. Verrill divided it into four districts, namely, the Carolinian, the Alleghenian, the Canadian, and the Hudsonian. These are distinguished by the ranges of mammals and reptiles, and the breeding-places of birds. The Carolinian fauna extends in a belt north of the Austroriparian subregion from Long Island, south of the hill region of New Jersey, to the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania, and thence inland. It embraces a wide belt in Maryland and Virginia, and all of central North Carolina, and then narrows very much in passing round south of the Alleghenies

<<<Page: 1235>>>

of Georgia. It extends north again, occupying East Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, the greater parts of Illinois and Ohio, and the southern border of Michigan. It includes southern Wisconsin and Minnesota, all of lowa, and the greater part of Missonri. The Alleghenian embraces the States north of the line just described, excepting the regions pertaining to the Canadian fauna, which I now describe. This includes northern Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, with the Green Mountains, the Adirondacks, and summits of the Allegheny Mountains as faras Georgia. It includes Canada east and north of the lakes. The Hudsonian fauna is entirely north of the isothermal of 50°. It has great extent west of Hudson Bay and is narrowed southeastward to Newfoundland.
The information as to the distribution of the Batrachia and Reptilia now at hand, points to the following conclusions: The Hudsonian fauna need not be further referred to here, as it is part of the Holarctic region. The Canadian is sustained, as defined by the range of certain Batrachia. The demarkation between the Alleghenian and Carolinian is determined by the northern limit of most of the species common to the Kastern and Austroriparian subregions. An important division is indicated by the boundaries set to the range of certain species by the Allegheny Mountains. This division affects chiefly the Carolinian district of Verrill, and I therefore propose to abolish that name, and replace it by the two terms Cisalleghenian for the Eastern and Transalleghenian for the Western districts. They are separated from each other by the Alleghenian district of the foothills and the Canadian of the summits of the Allegheny Mountains.
The species which are found over the entire Eastern subregion, and not elsewhere, are the following:
Amblystoma jeffersonianum Green. Plethodon cinereus Green.
Rana silwatica Le Conte.
Rana palustris Le Conte.
Osceola doliata triangula Boie. Natrix fasciata sipedon Linnzeus. Hutenia sirtalis graminea Cope.
The Canadian district is characterized by the following species, which are restricted to it:
Amblystoma jeffersonianum laterale Hallowell. Gyrinophilus porphyriticus Green. Desmognathus ochrophea Cope.
Desmognathus nigra Green.
Bufo lentiginosus fowlervi Putnam.
Rana cantabrigensis Baird.
Rana septentrionalis Baird.
The list above given as universally distributed in the Eastern subregion characterizes the Alleghenian district. I know of no species
+ 4 ut : ‘

that is restricted to it. The genera which do not extend north of it are the following:
BATRACHIA. SERPENTES. Chorophilus. Carphophiops. Hyla. Coluber. Hemidactylium. Cyclophis. Cryptobranchus. Natrix. Necturus. Ophibolus.
SAURIA. Heterodon. Sceloporus. Ancistrodon.
San Tae Sistrurus. Crotalus.
The two remaining districts include the large number of species which are common to the Eastern and Austroriparian subregions enumerated under the latter head. The Cisalleghenian is further characterized by the following:
Hyla andersonii Baird. Rana virgatipes Cope. Ophibolus rhombomaculatus Holbrook. To these must be added from the Austroriparian list: Abastor erythrogrammus Daudin. The following species are peculiar to the Transalleghenian district: Chondrotus microstomus Cope. Spelerpes maculicandus Cope. Rana areolata circulosa Rice and Davis. Carphophiops vermis Kennicott. Coluber vulpinus Baird and Girard. Ophibolus calligaster Say. Eutenia radix Baird and Girard. Eutenia butlerti Cope. Tropidoclonium lineatum Hallowell. Natrix kirtlandii Kennicott. Sistrurus catenatus Ratinesque.
Probably Futenia brachystoma Cope belongs to this district, but only one specimen has been found.
The following species enter this district only from the Austroriparian:
Natrix grahamii Baird and Girard. Eutenia proxima Say.
Of the species peculiar to the Transalleghenian district, Ophibolus calligaster and Tropidoclonium lineatum extend into the northern limits of the Texan district.
The genera which do not range northward of the Cisalleghenian district are Cnemidophorus, Liolepisma, and Abastor.

Il. THE AUSTRORIPARIAN SUBREGION.
This subregion is the range of a large number of species of Batrachia and Reptilia, only a part of which occupy it to the exclusion of all other subregions, and another series of which occupy parts only of its area. Three centers of distribution within its borders may be discerned—the Ocmulgian, the Louisianian, and the Texan. The Texan is especially characterized by the combination of the Austroriparian fauna with a considerable number of the species of the Sonoran subregion. The characteristic Austroriparian species are the following:
Siren lacertina Linnzeus. URODELA.

The species which enter the Texan territory from the Sonoran extend
to various distances to the north and east. Thus, Crotaphytus collaris ranges to southern Missouri, and Holbrookia maculata to Arkansas. Sceloporus spinosus extends along the Gulf States to western Florida. Phrynosoma cornutum extends eastward to Dallas, Texas. Rhinochilus lecontei, on the other hand, has not been found eastof Austin. Several species from the extreme southwest of Texas have not been included in the above lists, since some of them are well known to belong to the Central American fauna, while the range of others is probably similar, but is not sufficiently known. Of the former kind are Drymobius margaritiferus Schlegel, Sibon albofuscum Lacépéde, and Coniophanes imperialis Baird and Girard, of the latter are Lysoptychus lateralis Cope, Holbrookia proprinqua Baird and Girard, and Hypopachus cuneus Cope.

This subregion presents several natural divisions, as follows: I. The Lower Californian district, including only the region at the extremity of the peninsula of Lower California; II. The Chihuahuan district, embracing the State of Sonora, Mexico, the northern part of the Mexican Plateau, Arizona south of the San Francisco Mountains; most of the peninsula of Lower California, and most of New Mexico; ILI. The Basin district, embracing the Great Basin of Utah and Oregon, to Vernon, British Columbia; and IV. The Central district, which includes the high plains east of the Rocky Mountains, from Texas northward, excepting the river bottoms which cross it from west to east. This great subregion is bound together by the general distribution of numer-— ous genera; but I do not know a single species which covers its entire area which is not found elsewhere. These define the districts.

Three species of Testudinata are peculiar to this district, namely, Cinosternum henrici Lecépede; C. flavescens Agassiz, and Xerobates agassizii Cooper. This district possesses a larger number of peculiar species than any other in the Medicolumbian Region.
The Basin district has but few peculiar species. Its southern boundary may be regarded as the San Irancisco Mountains in northern Arizona. The Crotalus tigris, which is restricted to it, has been shown by Dr. Merriam to inhabit only the mountains, and its northern limit is as yet unknown. The following are the species of the Great Basin:

This subregion presents two distinct modifications, a northern and a southern. The boundary between the two has not yet been defined ; it represents the demarkation between the greater humidity of the north and the arid conditions of the south. The name Diegan has been given by Mr. Van Denburgh to the southern region; to the northern I propose to restrict the name Pacific, which I formerly used for the entire subregion, which had been previously named the Western by Baird. The Pacific district extends farther south along the Sierra Nevada than in the San Joaquin Valley. Some of the forms of the Diegan district extend north to the latitude of San Francisco, but the majority of the species are restricted to more southern latitudes. How far the Diegan district extends on the Lower Californian Peninsula is uncertain. The separation from the Chihuahuan district is also undetermined, and the species of both districts mingle in some degree on their borders.
Species peculiar to the Diegan district are the following:
BATRACHIA. Rufo columbiensis halophila Baird and Girard. SAURIA.
Uta repens Van Denburgh.
Uta mearnsti Stejneger.
Sceloporus orcuttvi Stejneger. Sceloporus vandenbergianus Cope. Phrynosoma cerroénse Stejneger.
Anota goodei Stejneger.
Xantusia vigilis Baird.
Xantusia riversiana Cope. Xantusia picta Cope.
Zablepsis henshavii Stejneger. Amebopsis gilbertii Van Denburgh. Verticaria sericea Van Denburgh. Cnemidophorus tessellatus multiscutatus Cope. Cnemidophorus tessellatus rubidus Cope. Anniella pulehra Gray. SERPENTES.
Lichanura orcuttii Stejneger. Diadophis amabilis amabilis Baird and Girard. Orotalus ruber Cope.
To these must be added the species already enumerated as common to the Diegan and Lower California districts, and the following list of species which occur also in the Chihuahuan district:
Crotaphytus wislizenti Baird and Girard. Callisaurus draconoides Blainville.

<<<Page: 1249>>>

Uta stansburiana Baird and Girard. Sceloporus biseriatus Hallowell. Lichanura roseofusca Cope. Crotalus adamanteus atrox Baird and Girard. The following species are common to the Diegan and Pacific districts:
Diemyctylus torosus Eschscholtz. Hyla regilla Baird and Girard.*
Phrynosoma blainvilli Gray.. Gerrhonotus multicarinatus Blainville.* Gerrhonotus burnettii Gray. Eumeces skiltonianus Baird and Girard.
Charina botte Blainville.

Pityophis catenifer Blainville.
Ophibolus getulus boylii Baird and Girard.* EHutenia elegans couchit Kennicott.*
Hutania infernalis infernalis Blainville. Crotalus confluentus lucifer Baird and Girard.
These species are then characteristic of the Western subregion as a whole, except those marked with a star, which occur elsewhere.
The Pacific district is especially characterized by certain genera and species of Batrachéa. No certainly known genus of scaled reptiles and a limited number of species and subspecies are peculiar to it. Conspicuous among these are the species of Hutenia, which display great variety, while they are but sparsely represented in the Diegan district. The peculiar species are as follows:
Amblystoma macrodactylum Baird. Amblystoma epixanthum Cope. Chondrotus paroticus Baird. Chondrotus decorticatus Cope. Chondrotus aterrimus Cope. Chondrotus tenebrosus Baird and Girard. Batrachoseps caudatus Cope. Batrachoseps attenwatus Eschscholtz. Plethodon intermedius Baird. Plethodon oregonensis Girard. Autodax lugubris Hallowell.

This subregion includes three districts which possess characteristic species and which differ in climate. The Austroriental is a humid region, with abundant rains and fogs, and includes the eastern face and slope of the central plateau, with the mountain elevations, including parts of the States of Puebla, Vera Cruz, Hidalgo, and San Luis Potosi. It is cut off to the north from the Austroriparian subregion by an interval in the States of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. The middle or Austrocentral district includes the valleys of Mexico and Toluca, and the region northward to the edge of the Sonoran subregion, including the State of Guanajuato, and perhaps farther north. The climate of this district is much less humid than that of the Austroriental district. The Austroccidental district includes the high lands of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Jalisco. It is the most arid of the three divisions and extends farthest to the south and west.
The northern boundary of the Toltecan subregion is not yet determinable; hence it is not possible to state whether species from the States of Durango and Zacatecas, such as Hutenia angustirostris, should be referred to it or not. A small collection made by Wilkinson in southern Chihuahua at Batopilas' has the character of the Chihuahuan fauna, with the following species not otherwise found in it:
Anolis nebulosus Wiegmann. Uta bicarinata Duméril. Scolecophis emulus Cope.
The humid and dry districts of the Toltecan subregion repeat in petto the differences between the Austroriparian and Sonoran subregions. The Austroriental district is distinguished by the larger number of batrachian genera and species and of certain genera of Crotalide. It also includes some genera which may be regarded as immigrants from the Central American region of the Neotropical realm.
The characteristic species of the Austrocentral district are:?
Siredon mexicanum Shaw. Amblystoma tigrinum Green.
Bufo compactilis Wiegmann. Bufo intermedius Giinther. Spea multiplicata Cope. Spea hammondii Baird. Hyla eximia Baird.
Hyla arenicolor Cope.
Rana montezumae Baird.

Barissia imbricata Wiegmann. Sceloporus variabilis Wiegmann. Sceloporus microlepidotus Wiegmann. Phrynosoma orbiculare Wiegmann. Hutenia pulchrilatus Cope. Species found in the Austroriparian subregion. Liolepisma laterale Say. Storeria dekayt Storer. Storeria occiptomaculata Holbrook.
To the Austroriental list might be added Spelerpes bellii Gray, which is stated by Sumichrast to inhabit also the Tierra Caliente; and Anolis nannodes Cope, which the same authority says ranges from the Tierra Caliente into the Alpine district. The water-snake Natrix rhombifera Hallowell may occur in the Austroriental district, but this needs confirmation.
The Austroccidental district is inhabited by a number of peculiar species, together with some which occur in the other two districts of the 'Toltecan subregion. One peculiarity of this district is the poverty in Batrachia and the absence of Urodela. The peculiar species are the following:
SALIENTIA. Leptodactylus melanonotus Hallowell. Hypopachus variolosus Cope.

PLATE 12, Hemipenes of representative types.
The figures on Plates 12 to 31, excepting fig. 9, Plate 22, represent the hemipenis of a side split open so as to show the struetures that are exhibited by the entire circumference. Each figure is therefore twice as wide as the organ in its normal condition. Where the organ is bifureate one branch only is split, the other being represented as invaginated, and with a portion of the retractor musele continuous with its apex.
