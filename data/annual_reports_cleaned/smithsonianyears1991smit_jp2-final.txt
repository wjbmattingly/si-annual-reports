Appendix 7
Donors to the Smithsonian Institution in
Fiscal Year 1991
The Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian join with the entire staff in thanking all of the Institution's friends for the generosity they have shown with their financial support, gifts to the collections, and inkind donations. Gifts are recorded under the title of the recipient bureau or office, with a brief description of the gift where appropriate. If perchance the name of any donor has been omitted from these lists, it is an inadvertence and in no way diminishes the Institution's gratitude. Many gifts were received from donors who prefer to remain anonymous; the Smithsonian wishes to thank these people, as well, for their support.
