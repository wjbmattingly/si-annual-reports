The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

The Attic Refurbished
THIS IS THE YEAR of the Bicentennial, and this Institution can take pride in its accomplishments after nearly ten years of preparation. It is a year in which a new Smithsonian museum, newly opened on July 1, 1976, the National Air and Space Museum, played host to two million visitors in its first forty-nine days of existence, surely a record of some kind. It is a year in which we successfully looked backwards to a hundred years ago, with the opening of “1876: A Centennial Exhibition,” a simulacrum of the great Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, using the same materials, and displaying them in the building on the Mall originally built to house the fortytwo carloads of material given to the Smithsonian at the time the Philadelphia exposition closed. After a year and a half of the most painstaking restoration and refurbishing, that exhibit opened on May 10, 1976, one hundred years to the day from the opening in Fairmount Park, complete with carriages, prayers, the Hallelujah Chorus, release of pigeons, and the John Philip Sousa music composed for the occasion. Each of these great exhibits, the one celebrating the achievements of America’s first hundred years, the other celebrating the triumphs of American technology of our second hundred years, creates an atmosphere of excitement, of sheer pleasure, and of enthusiasm which is contagious.
Nor were these all. The rest of the Smithsonian celebrated alike, each museum or bureau with a triumphant series of exhibitions, the best Festival of American Folklife ever, and a marvelous array of traveling exhibits, portfolios, courses, lectures, and visiting smaller exhibits of exquisite beauty and rarity. Truly the Bicentennial year has been a triumph for collections, the justification of all that has

<<<Page: 15>>>

gone before. These magnificent exhibitions remind us of our national esprit, and of our special human qualities—innate curiosity combined with memory, and the insatiable will to discover.
And the people came. Several years ago we predicted that there would be a vast turnout of visitors during the Bicentennial summer. Perhaps the expectations of the business bureaux were overly aroused, for the final city figures and those of hotels, motels, and so on, have been lower than expected this spring, right up and down the East Coast. But the Smithsonian visitation, after a rather slow start, has been picking up steadily since the glorious Fourth, and indeed that last week of July and the first week of August, for example, our visitors were up a full 20 percent over the year before. We are conducting a study to determine who they are, and why and where they are staying. In any case, it appears likely that earlier news reports of light visits to Washington in the spring produced more tourists later, as well as a different manner of coming, hard for the business or other count-takers to assess; namely, the use of campers, trailers, or backpacks by many people who may just come by for a day, and camp out of town somewhere at night, even bringing their own food. The National Park Service seems to agree with us that visiting was heavy, but the manner of visits has changed.
But the visitors have written in; witness this visitor from South Carolina:
“Dear Sirs,
I must take this opportunity to say ‘Thank you’ for your part in making this a wonderful vacation to your city.
People like you, proved all the ‘wild tales’ I’d been told were false.
The week I spent in Washington, ‘The days at the Smithsonian’ will be a memory I'll cherish.
I hope to return in the near future.
God Bless— Sincerely”
Certainly this Institution is proud to be part of Washington, and proud too to have the great collections which make us the ““Magnet on the Mall.” The collections are as much a part of the Smithsonian as any other. In the original Act of Congress of 1846 occur the

words: “All objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States
.. Shall be delivered . . . and shall be arranged in such order, and so classed, as best to facilitate the examination and study of them, in the building . . . for the Institution.” By 1857, it had been definitely settled that Congress would make the necessary appropriations for the museum’s maintenance. As Paul Oehser in his book’ on the Smithsonian has written, and as the early Annual Reports of the Institution amply demonstrate, Joseph Henry, the first Secretary, “ .. would rather have seen the museum separate from the Smithsonian. He did not relish the idea of having to depend on annual Government appropriation for Smithsonian activities. It would, he thought, ‘annually bring the Institution before Congress as a supplicant for government patronage, and ultimately subject it to political influence and control.’ He wanted the Institution to ‘mingle its operations as little as possible with those of the general government... .’” But that was not to be, for under the original Act as quoted above, the Smithsonian was specifically charged with the museum collections function, and so by 1858 an appropriation of $4,000 was made for the arrangement and care of the national collections, and appropriations in increasing amounts, as the collections and the visitation (and inflation) have increased, have continued ever since.
By 1877, it was obvious—the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition (in which the Smithsonian had played a leading part in arranging the Government exhibitions) having resulted in a shower of gifts to the Institution—that additional space must be secured. This was the genesis of the Institution’s second building, the Arts and Industries Building, so-called, which we reopened in Centennial style. As the Regents of the time proposed to the Senate, it would be necessary for the nation to pay for the maintenance, care, and upkeep of these national collections. So Senator Hiester Clymer averred, introducing the bill for the appropriation of construction funds for the new building: “It may not be disputed that the acceptance of them (the gifts) by the Government imposes an obligation that they shall be
1 Sons of Science, page 67 (New York, N.Y.: H. Schuman, 1949).
Statement by the Secretary / 5

<<<Page: 17>>>

preserved and exhibited for the gratification and instruction of the people... .”
Public instruction has been the cornerstone of the policy of every generation of Regents and Secretary alike in this Institution. For the purposes of public instruction, the need for continuing federal support is clear, whether the means adopted be exhibits, traveling exhibits, publications ranging from guidebooks to encyclopedias of knowledge, or kindred forms of diffusion.
Similar sentiments were expressed in Congress, and by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905, when Charles Lang Freer indicated that he would give his collections and funds for a building to be part of the national heritage. Roosevelt writing to the Board of Regents urged the gift upon them:
“All that is asked of the government or the Regents of the Smithsonian now is that they shall accept this magnificently generous offer. . . . Congress will have to take some steps to provide the comparatively small sum necessary to take care of what will be a national asset. . . . I hope the Regents will feel warrented to close with the offer; for they are the national guardians of such a collection.”
Congress in subsequent years has often reaffirmed this principle, as in the Act of May 17, 1938, describing the purposes of the National Collection of Fine Arts.
“... (a) It shall be the policy of the Regents to maintain a worthy standard for the acceptance of art objects for exhibition in the Gallery . . . and the Regents are hereby authorized to solicit and receive private donations of works of art and contributions of funds from private sources for the purchase of works of art....
“.. . (b) In order to encourage the development of contemporary art and effect the widest distribution and cultivation in matters of such art, the Regents are hereby authorized to solicit and receive funds from private sources, to acquire (by purchase or otherwise) and sell contemporary works of art or
copies thereof, to employ ... artists... .
Statements such as these continue over the years: in 1946 (establishment of the National Air Museum, Public Law 722); in 1962

<<<Page: 18>>>

(establishment of the National Portrait Gallery, Public Law 443); and all echo the words of Joseph Henry when in 1855 he stated: “The principal aim, therefore, in taking charge of all the specimens (of every kind) is not to swell the Smithsonian collection, but to preserve them from destruction, and to render them immediately available,” (and here he writes of everything from natural history specimens to “a valuable collection of engravings by the first masters’’ —who were they, I wonder, for these were presumably lost in the fire ten years later?). And Henry goes on, “.. . with the hope that Congress will, at some future day, make a liberal appropriation to support a national collection.”
And so it has proved, for Congress has indeed taken the Smithsonian most seriously, as a special trust responsibility to which it pledged “the faith of the United States” in 1836, and has been generous in its stated purposes to improve and protect the national collections.
Congress now appropriates about one hundred million dollars a year to maintain collections, to provide for their study and display, and to support other operations of the Institution. A much appreciated and generous figure indeed, but one which deserves a brief assessment. It is my suspicion that the collections of scientific materials, art objects, books, and historical materials amassed by the Institution over the years, while obviously priceless to the nation in general terms, could be valued to surpass Mr. Smithson’s original seed money of somewhat over $500,000 by a factor of at least ten thousand, or something between five and six billion dollars. If the annual interest on such a vast sum were to be reckoned as the appropriate amount to be made available for collections maintenance and operations, it would be seen that our current levels of funds represent about a third of what could prudently be spent without exceeding our income.
In this connection it has always been hoped that a “liberal distribution of the duplicate specimens should be made to societies and other establishments in this country and abroad” (quoting Henry’s Ninth Annual Report, page 25, 1855). Although Secretary Spencer Baird, who followed Henry, attempted to furnish materials to a number of early scientific societies in this country, the later development of scientific methods requiring series of duplicate specimens for certain studies somewhat cramped the fulfillment of this
Statement by the Secretary / 7

<<<Page: 19>>>

ideal concept. As a result, the Smithsonian has never been able freely to open up its “riches” and lavishly distribute duplicates to kindred museums. Sensible exchanges, trade-offs, and deposits, particularly in the scientific fields, but also in the art field are sometimes made, but always with committee or commission approvals, and sometimes with specific scrutiny by the Regents according to a set of rules adopted by the Board.
It has always seemed sad that objects of great importance or exhibit potential were not more plentiful, for every year the Institution is petitioned to start a satellite museum here or there in the country at large. But there are simply not enough objects of exhibit quality to go round to develop a collection of subsidiary museums. That is partly why the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service has come into its own, as a source of surrogate exhibitions which can be shared across the fifty States, and enjoyed by additional millions of viewers. And this Bicentennial year has been a notable one for our Service, with 200 exhibitions traveling to forty-eight States. Dennis Gould, our Director, deserves great credit for his persistence, and the ability of his organization to deliver on time. We estimate that these exhibitions alone have been seen by over eight million people in this past year.
Even so, the collections continue to mount in number, and demands for space proliferate. As I wrote in last year’s annual report, Smithsonian Year 1975, “museum keepers know that the supply of objects, whether made by man, or great natural objects such as whales or pandas, are finite in number and will inevitably run out in due course.” We continue to be offered many things, and even with a discriminating eye, there are certain things which we must legitimately accept. We can turn things down, as I reported last year, or we can redirect them to places which seem more appropriate, especially, for example, objects of preeminent state interest which should go to state institutions. But there are always objects which fit in, or which fill an important gap, and these we continue to receive, fulfilling our basic responsibility.
Last year I wrote that one of the things that we would dearly love to secure for our collection of transportation was a donkey engine, as its absence was a serious gap in our history of railroad evolution. Such a miniature, narrow-gauge creature is of considerable rarity in this day and age. Having heard that these little gems

can still sometimes be found rusting away in some southern pineland lumber yard, I prayed—‘’Oh Georgia-Pacific, Oh Weyerhaeuser, where is thy benison? Where in some neglected forest glade lies maundering that rusting hulk?”
But romantic prayers fell on deaf ears, and nary a peep or chirrup of recognition came from the busy giants of the lumber industry. It is no wonder, for all the great timber companies of the world today seem to be intent on besting their competitors in cutting down the tropical forests of the world. I am told by the New York Botanical Garden that these tropical forests, either through lumbering or burning off, are being cut at the rate of 49.2 acres a minute, day in, day out, over 22 million acres per year.
Rather, an answer to prayer has come from a Mr. Gerald M. Best of Beverly Hills, California, who all these years has preserved and lavished attention on “oLtomana,” a donkey engine from the Island of Maui in Hawaii. Mr. Best has promised that he and his wife will give us “OLOMANA,” and so the final jewel has been placed in the diadem of the Museum of History and Technology’s Department of Transportation. “oLomaNna” will take her rightful place beside the great Southern locomotive, No. 1401, and the San Francisco Cable ’ our oldest horseless, belching monster of the rails. It will be interesting to see if our curators can reconstruct the

voice of “OLOMANA,” on tape, to ring out every so often, and amaze the children of all ages who throng the Hall of Transportation, and are so enraptured by the thunderous song of the Southern locomotive. That one has a wonderful taped voice including the word “bo---ard” among the roars, the pants, and puffs of the start-up, the shattering passage down the track, and the final mournful whistle echoing over the distant prairie at the end.
And yet all these objects take care and conservation, whether books, or paintings, or early transportation. Our paramount need is still a museum’s support center, in nearby Maryland, on land already in public ownership, which will give us the conservation, storage, and work areas that make collections come to life, and keep the Smithsonian where it should be in the vanguard of preservation, retrieval, and conservation. Without this facility, and without an appropriate library for our History of Science collections, the nagging dilemma will continue, the reception of collections with inadequate facilities to house them and the gradual deterioration as a

result, or the rejection of needed materials—to moulder and lie a-rusting somewhere else.
But what we have done this past year has been a triumph. The quality and style of exhibitions all over Washington have been an appropriate tribute to the Bicentennial, and have indeed made this city a focal point in a way nothing else could have so illumined the event. For perhaps obvious reasons there are common purposes to be discerned in the assembling of exhibitions either in science, history, or art, which have to do with the celebration of a Bicentennial. As mentioned earlier, two exhibitions have, it seems to me, a common theme. One is the creation of the great Air and Space Museum with its extraordinary exhibit of fact, which in truth outdoes fiction. The design and the settings in which man’s conquest of air and space is depicted are almost as handsome and as symbolically diverse and sophisticated as the creation of the objects themselves. They are highly appropriate. The history of air and space involves technological design and inventiveness of the first order. The objects are displayed in the awareness of these technologies and the results are meet and right. The building is in perfect scale, and the effect is not unlike a novel art museum, in which objects and display suit each other perfectly. This then is the epitome of the last eighty years, and of much of which the United States can be justly proud.
The “1876” exhibition similarly tells us what we were most proud of one hundred years ago. It is the history of the development of the United States as we conceived it at that time. Our pride was in the possibility of the mastery of the Continent. The horrible Civil War was behind us. Now we should turn our minds to the real priorities, to the unification of the Continent from “sea to shining sea.” Thus 1876” represents a kind of microcosm of the previous hundred years, and a sense of where we thought the priorities lay.
Another theme which seems to run through the exhibitions has had to do with the discovery of the Continent by foreigners and their impressions of the setting or the new-found objects or peoples. Thus at the National Gallery of Art there was a superb and fascinating exhibition, “The European Vision of America,” organized by Hugh Honour. Here one could delight by reflection in the marvels, some of them fanciful, of the new worlds across the seas, as seen by artists and naturalist draftsmen. In the same vein, but in a slightly different context, the National Portrait Gallery has mounted
10 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 22>>>

a triumph in representation of what the eighteenthand nineteenth-century travelers from abroad saw and thought about us all then. As John Russell said in the New York Times” “Nothing in American museum life is quite like the exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery... . They are about people . . . brought alive by paintings, photographs, objects and letters which document what they said, what they did, and what they saw. . . . What we experience at the National Portrait Gallery is resuscitation in depth.”’ It is a great show, and it does a great deal to tell one what America seemed like, truly or not, in foreign eyes. And as we all know we Americans are always immensely curious to know what others think of us.
A third theme might be described as what America has done to people, the people who came, and how they reacted. The Hirshhorn Museum has a fascinating exhibition, “The Golden Door,” which surveys the immigrant artists who came to America, and what they then proceeded to do in the Land of Opportunity, and how it managed, often subtly, to affect their style and their transition into a new consciousness in the New World. A monumental exhibit at the Museum of History and Technology called, ““A Nation of Nations” tells us about immigrants in general to this country, who came, and when, where from, and where they went, east and west, north and south. In the process we can see how ethnic roots have been preserved, and at the same time how the land and the setting have inevitably moulded customs and traditions. Styles of making things changed from region to region, even though the roots of the styles, or the utility of the objects, were held in common. Finally the homogenization of the late twentieth century is shown in glaring detail, but still with ethnic variety, e.g., McDonald’s signs in Japanese.
A third exhibit within this theme has been the major Bicentennial exhibition at the National Collection of Fine Arts, “America as Art.” Here is a sensitive interpretation of the evolution of indigenous art in America, what the country did to the eye of the artist—as a symbol—as a theater for the evolution of local character in opposition to European values. Here, landscape became a romantic notion, evoking moral values and an approach toward understanding

<<<Page: 23>>>

philosophic truths in nature. In a later state there is shown the paradox of sympathy for the noble savage in an idealized sense coupled with the frenzied exaltation of frontier conquest. Still later comes urbanism, the masses, the new realism, accompanied by the growth of a new liberalism, provoked perhaps by the vestiges of transcendentalism and moral superiority. At the end there is something of the current struggle of artists to decide how to break away from homogenization, to develop an identity out of uniformity.
A variant on this theme could be described as what people have done to America, and here the National Museum of Natural History has presented an ecological succession exhibition which graphically depicts changes in the environment of Washington, D. C., taken at a point where Rock Creek debouches on the Potomac River. Beginning some 10,000 years ago when the forest was primeval indeed, with tree boles of sycamores and other hardwoods as large as sequoias, down through the first cultivation by native Americans to the present parklike setting with benches, litter, rats, and sparrows, it is all there, a panorama of change pointing to a wholly uncertain future.
Other museum exhibits have been historic moments in time, depicting a stage in some cultural succession, or a glorious moment perceived and now lost. Thus, the Freer Gallery of Art chose to represent something of where culture or stages in life, as depicted in painting, stood in Asia in 1775. All over the world the late eighteenth century had life and vigor and style, and so it was in India, China, and Japan. The exhibit is exquisite in its selection and refined in taste. If there are intimations of revolution there, they escaped me.
An exhibition, celebrating a moment perceived and lost, has been “The Eye of Thomas Jefferson” at the National Gallery of Art. Romantic to the hilt, the objects brought together represent all the varied influences of the art and culture of Europe, a kind of impressionistic grand tour, which might have influenced Jefferson as a man for all seasons, architect, philosopher, aesthetic interpreter of life itself, and yet somehow a man of action, a superb politician, whose pen was mightier than many a sword. The exhibition was a glorious assemblage of objects of the time, a depiction of the surroundings of an enigma, an aristocrat and an elitist who could be a violent revolutionary in a time when revolutionaries tolerated gen-

tlemen and aesthetes among their company. How is it possible? It is too romantic for today. The moment has been lost in the stirring swirl of history, and we can view such diversity of style and character with pure nostalgia, convinced that we will not see such times, or such heroes again.
Then there have been small special exhibitions sent from abroad to honor the Bicentennial. One of them reached the Museum of History and Technology. It was an exhibit sent over especially to mark the visit of the Spanish King and Queen, but one which had taken years to plan, an exhibit about Columbus and with the artifacts connected with his voyages. There was the great Juan de la Cosa Map of 1500, never before seen outside of Spain, painted on a sheepskin as a guide to travelers to the new hemisphere, with symbolic representations of travel, such as the Three Kings journeying to pay homage to the Christ Child. There was Columbus’s copy of Marco Polo’s travels, appropriate reference reading for someone searching for the Indies. There were Columbus’s meditations in jail when the Bible became his support and comforter. There were documents, paintings, tapestry, and artifacts which made this a treasure trove to view, and transported the imagination back nearly five hundred years. Yes, nearly five hundred years; what will there be to commemorate in 1992?
A particularly precious exhibition was loaned to the Smithsonian, and to the Los Angeles County Museum by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain. This was a collection of anatomical drawings by Leonardo da Vinci from the Library at Windsor Castle. These drawings, with Leonardo’s enigmatic script notations, are so far ahead of their time (as witness contemporary anatomical drawings) that they excite wonder, admiration, and awe. Visiting scholars and students came from all over the Eastern States to see the exhibit, taking advantage of a very rare opportunity.
Additionally, for the visit of the Queen herself, we had the stylish exhibition of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and Silversmiths of gold and silver plate of all periods. This was in the original Smithsonian building, the “Castle,” where Her Majesty was greeted by the Chancellor and Regents, shown the tomb of James Smithson, and presented with a Joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States commemorating what is perhaps the largest philanthropic gift ever made to one nation by a citizen of another, the bequest of
Statement by the Secretary / 13

<<<Page: 25>>>

James Smithson. Thus the Congress was right to commemorate the event in this way, and it would seem as if Her Majesty, in this year of revolutions, should be pleased to think of what a Britisher had done for the United States, and what the results in subsequent years have been.
To measure all of the results of Mr. Smithson’s bequest would be an impossible task, I feel. We can only suspect that nothing quite like the present Institution could have been foreseen, or even planned a hundred and forty years ago, when the Act of acceptance was finally passed and signed into law. No comparable set of circumstances has existed in any other country. One of the joys of the creation of the Smithsonian has been that it inaugurated a vehicle by which the nation might be given things, and a way in which they might be accepted. Over the years the magnitude of the gifts—Smithson, Hodgkins, Sprague, Freer, Gallatly, the Walcotts, the Barneys, Dibner, Roebling, Mellon, Vetlesen, Winston, Link, Forrest, Bruce, the Ramseys, Reeves, Lilly, Becker, Johnson, Hirshhorn, and Post—more than justifies the funds from various sources spent annually to keep them up. We must take all possible steps necessary to assure that what we now possess is well cared for and thoroughly catalogued, or else fail in our trust to the donors. We would otherwise fail in our responsibility to the Executive and to the Congress, and thus imperil the very mandate of 1846, that “all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,” etc. . . . “shall be arranged in such order and so classed, as best to facilitate . . . the study of them... in the building . . . for the Institution.” This is a charge which we are solemnly obligated to carry out with the help of the Congress, God willing.
And we must keep “The Nation’s Attic” (as it is suspected Bernard de Voto first called us) in proper order so as to keep safely our stake in the future as well as the past. Let no one call the Smithsonian derelict in pointing out the urgent necessity of preserving the testament of the past in order to assure our future. For, as has been said before, history gives us ample reminders of the probable way of the future. If the Bicentennial has reminded us of anything, it has brought home to the Smithsonian the interest of our citizens in being reminded of the past, and the kindred interest in knowing more of the root stock from which we are all sprung. As I had

predicted, July Fourth was celebrated with a big bang, but there was more to it than that, more to it than the thrilling nostalgia of the Tall Ships. There was indeed a sense of rededication and newly reborn pride in being an American, after what now seem numbing years of uncertainty and denigration. Can we discern something? Through the smog of oral and visual logomania which surrounds us, can we perceive a new will, a new desire for humanity, for honesty and tolerance? If we can, then indeed our Bicentennial will have been worthwhile.
Tuis PAST YEAR has brought sadness to the Smithsonian in the untimely death of Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, scholar, poet, and expert administrator, whom we shall long mourn. Mr. Brooks had been with the Institution a scant five years, but had already endeared himself to his colleagues with his fair-minded outlook and good humor. Less than a year after joining the staff, we have also lost our Coordinator of Membership and Development, Lawrence E. Layborne, a valued new addition indeed. We shall miss his style and gentle spirit.
Another loss has been the nation’s gain, for this year Professor Daniel J. Boorstin, Senior Historian, National Museum of History and Technology, has left us to become the nation’s twelfth Librarian of Congress. The appointment is particularly welcome to the Smithsonian, symbolizing as it does the traditional partnership in scholarly exchange and book collection that has illuminated the entire history of our two institutions.
As Assistant Secretary for Administration, John F. Jameson, a relative veteran of the Smithsonian in spite of his years, has been appointed to assist me in integration of the management functions of the Secretary’s office. As Chief Budget Officer of the Institution, he has developed a particular view of the whole operation which is invaluable.
Dr. Kevin Sullivan has been appointed Director of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies after serving for five years on that staff. He succeeds Dr. Francis S. L. Williamson, who decided to resign after a year’s leave of absence in order to continue as Commissioner of Public Health and Social Services for the State
of Alaska.

Professor Herbert Gursky has been appointed Associate Director of the Center for Astrophysics (Optical and Infrared Division), Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Among our affiliates, Miss Ruth Graves has taken the position of Director of Reading Is Fundamental, and Messrs. Donald Elliott and Harold Leuba have become Vice Presidents of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange. Mr. George Packard has become Deputy Director of the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars to replace Professor Prosser Gifford, who has returned to Amherst College as Dean after a year’s leave of absence.
Retirements this year included Dr. Waldo Wedel, Senior Anthropologist and distinguished authority on Indian archeology, from the staff of the National Museum of Natural History, and Dr. Helmut K. Buechner as Biologist from the National Zoo. Sadly, Dr. Buechner has recently died after a long illness. His ecological research studies, particularly of ungulates in East Africa, are classics in their field.
Finally to all those unsung heroes and heroines of the Smithsonian staff who kept the wheels rolling, and who performed unstintingly and with unfailing politeness to keep this Institution’s Bicentennial observance on a plane above any single other equivalent ceremonies that I know of, may I say how grateful America must and should be to you all!

Board of Regents
THE BOARD OF REGENTS met in fiscal year 1976 in the autumn, winter, and spring, as is customary. At the autumn meeting on September 30, 1975, it was attested that Dr. John Nicholas Brown and Thomas J. Watson, Jr., had been reappointed as Citizen Regents. The Secretary reviewed the financial report of the Smithsonian and described the present schedule of the Bicentennial programs. Of particular significance was the report that the National Air and Space Museum would be completed on time and that the costs for construction would be under the original estimate.
Progress was also reported on the joint sponsorship by Wells Fargo and Company and the Smithsonian of the Bicentennial Essay Contest authorized by the Regents which would serve to focus attention on the more positive and exciting prospects that face our country in its third century. Nine distinguished Americans agreed to serve as national judges to vote on submissions made by various categories of contestants on the subject “Toward Our Third Century.”
Two recent legislative actions were noted. The first reserves for Smithsonian use in the future the last remaining site on the Mall, located between Third and Fourth Streets and Independence Avenue and Jefferson Drive. The second measure authorizes the preparation of plans for museum support facilities for the care, curation, conservation, deposit, preparation, and study of the national collections of scientific, historic, and artistic objects, specimens, and artifacts; for related documentation of such collections of the Smithsonian; and for the training of museum conservators.
The first anniversary of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden was celebrated after the Regents’ meeting at the Museum. The Museum has a visitor attendance of 1.8 million in the year.
The winter meeting of the Board of Regents was held on January 22, 1976. Special recognition was given to Mr. James E. Webb as an outstanding Regent and Chairman of the Executive Committee. The financial report of the Institution was summarized by the
Statement by the Secretary / 17

<<<Page: 29>>>

Secretary for the Board, and a full discussion of the finances of the Institution will be found in this report.
The Board of Regents determined that the Smithsonian Institution is financially unable to operate Hillwood as a nonprofit museum under the terms specified in the Agreement between the Institution and Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post and therefore directed, in accordance with the provisions of Mrs. Post’s will, that title to Hillwood pass to the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of D.C. on July 1, 1976.
In commemoration of the nation’s Bicentennial, the Regents voted to award a number of medals to the following recipients for distinguished achievement in areas of Institutional interest: The Smithsonian Medal to Nancy Hanks, the Langley Medal to Grover Loening and James E. Webb, the Henry Medal to Dr. Martin H. Moynihan and Dr. T. Dale Stewart, the Matthew Fontaine Maury Medal to Dr. Robert M. White, and the Redes Medal to Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond.
The designation of the ‘Doris and eee) Dreyfus Memorial Study Center” in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design was approved in recognition of the contributions of Henry Dreyfus to the field of industrial design. The generous donations of Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Heinz II to the Cooper-Hewitt were underscored by the naming of the “Drue Heinz Study Center for Drawings and Prints.” The Regents also approved the name “Waldo L. Schmitt Conference Room” for a room in the Invertebrate Zoology area of the National Museum of Natural History in honor of Dr. Schmitt’s outstanding contributions to invertebrate zoology.
A number of legislative proposals were approved for submission to the Congress, including measures to authorize appropriations under the National Museum Act, to eliminate the ceiling on appropriations for the Barro Colorado Island at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and to authorize the construction of a museum support facility. The Secretary reported that the two measures, approved by the Board of Regents in 1974, to authorize planning of a museum support facility and to remove restrictions on the collection of portraiture by the National Portrait Gallery have been enacted.
The Secretary discussed plans for the forthcoming visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the Smithsonian Institution. It was

agreed to request a Joint Resolution of the House and Senate to express the American people’s gratitude for the bequest of James Smithson
The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was convened on May 10, 1976. At this meeting the Regents paid tribute to the Smithsonian’s late Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, hailing particularly his outstanding classical scholarship and his remarkable administrative career. The Secretary introduced to the Regents John F. Jameson, newly designated as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Administration.
The financial reports were summarized by the Secretary and accepted by the Board, including the estimate for the “transition quarter” from July 1 to September 30, 1976, occasioned by the change in the beginning of the fiscal year from the first of July to the first of October.
The Secretary reported developments at the National Zoo, including the renovation of the elephant house, the new bird yards, and the glockenspiel provided by a bequest. The first portion of the new “William M. Mann Lion and Tiger Exhibit” was opened to the public on April 9, 1976. This exhibit received a design award in 1975.
An underground parking garage on the Mall was again considered by the Board as a possibility for the future. A recent up-date ~ of an earlier study indicates that 3,200 parking spaces could be constructed under the Mall. It was decided to continue to examine possibilities for the construction and financing of this parking facility in cooperation with the National Park Service and other interested government agencies.
Noting progress on a number of legislative matters, the Board of Regents reviewed the language of the proposed Joint Resolution of the Senate and House on the occasion of the visit of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design having progressed on schedule toward its opening in the renovated Carnegie Mansion in New York, the next meeting of the Regents was scheduled to precede that opening in early October.

Smithsonian Year « 1976
THIS REPORT coveRS the fiscal year 1976 and the added three months’ “Transition Quarter” (July 1-September 30, 1976), reflecting our change in fiscal year to conform with the new federal year beginning October Ist.
In this period the Institution continued to benefit from both strong governmental support and growth in nonfederal income. As shown in Table 1, federal appropriations received for operating purposes rose 12.7 percent to $84,004,000 in fiscal year 1976, with an additional $23,150,000 for the Transition Quarter; together, these appropriations amounted to 77 percent of the total operating support in the 15 months’ period. Research grants and contracts provided another 11 percent, while nonfederal funds from gifts, endowments and our various auxiliary activities and concessions supplied the remaining $16,438,000 or 12 percent of the total. For construction purposes, the Institution received an additional $13,922,000 of federal appropriations and $560,000 of gifts from private sources.
The increased income for the most part went to meet inflationary cost increases and to make possible the outstanding Smithsonian Bicentennial programs for the nation’s capital, including the opening of the new National Air and Space Museum, a summer-long international folk festival on the Mall, and a wide variety of major exhibitions. Nearly $10,000,000 of federal construction funds were used to continue the modernization of the National Zoo, while renovation of the Carnegie Mansion in New York City for the

<<<Page: 41>>>

October opening of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and construction of the new Associates Court, public and staff restaurants and educational facilities in the National Museum of Natural History, were completed with nonfederal trust funds, derived principally from our fund-raising and Associates activities. This period also saw the completion of our Museum Shop construction and modernization program which will benefit visitors and the Institution alike.
A further step was taken toward the building of our present relatively small unrestricted-purpose endowment funds to a level capable of assuring stable financial support for nonfederally supported Institutional needs in the future; continuation and enlargement of this effort remains a goal of highest priority.
An overall picture of the application of all of these funds for operating purposes (exclusive of foreign currency and construction funds) by individual bureaux and offices may be seen in Table 2.
The $81,564,000 of federal funds received for Institutional operating purposes in the 12 months of fiscal year 1976, exclusive of funds for the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., and the Excess Foreign Currency Programs, was an increase of $10,858,000 over fiscal year 1975. Well over half of this increase ($6.0 million), however, was provided merely to meet costs of legislated and other uncontrollable increases in federal salaries, plus sharp increases in utility rates and other inflationary cost increases. A further $2,800,000 was made available to equip and staff the new National Air and Space Museum, and $700,000 was added for our Bicentennial Program. A large part of the remaining $1.4 million was needed for maintenance, protection, conservation, and other program support activities, with relatively little available for any expansion of programmatic efforts themselves. The resulting allocation by broad program categories is set forth in Table 3.
As the year progressed, it became possible to hold costs to lower amounts than originally anticipated; as a result, some $1,271,000 of the $104,193,000 combined appropriations for operating purposes in fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter was returned to the United States Treasury.
For the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, $1,940,000 was provided for fiscal year 1976, and another $521,000 for the

Transition Quarter. The operations of this bureau have continued to expand both as to contribution into the research project data bank and also in providing summaries of such data requested by its customers. Payments for the latter services, suggested several years ago by the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress as an alternative to increased appropriations, are growing steadily and have proven very successful in allowing the Exchange to meet its total increase in costs with only minimal added federal support.
Federal funds for the Smithsonian’s Foreign Currency Program, which provides grants to United States educational institutions for field research in those countries where these blocked foreign currencies remain available, were curtailed sharply in fiscal year 1976 to only $500,000. Thus, usage of these funds, together with remaining prior-year balances, was limited primarily to supporting priority ongoing research needs (see Table 4).
Federal appropriations for the Institution’s construction purposes in fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter totaling $13,922,000 included $2,500,000 to complete the National Air and Space Museum, an amount which was $500,000 less than anticipated at

the beginning of construction. Another $9,830,000 of the total allowed the continued gradual renovation of the National Zoo in accordance with its previously approved Master Plan. Major specific projects paid for with these appropriations included the service facility to consolidate support functions, new bear exhibits, continued planning for Beaver Valley exhibits, planning and installation of educational graphics, and repairs and renovation of Zoo facilities at the Rock Creek and Front Royal locations. An additional $1,592,000 was granted for restoration and renovation of other Institutional buildings.
Grants and contracts from federal agencies also provided substantial support to the Institution research programs over the past 15 months. During fiscal year 1976, $11,525,000 was expended, roughly the same as in the prior fiscal year, and a further $3,987,000 was expended during the Transition Quarter, primarily for work in the scientific disciplines. The major granting agencies are listed in Table 5 for this and prior periods representing hundreds of different grants and contracts each year.

structure as they have been ever since the Institution was established in 1846. In order for the Smithsonian to continue its position as an outstanding cultural and scientific resource for the entire nation, this important and flexible source of support must be maintained and strengthened. Efforts toward this goal were continued successfully in this Bicentennial period.
Most encouraging perhaps has been the continued success of the Associates program, including the Smithsonian magazine, and also our Museum Shops and related programs featuring sales of products based on interesting and informative items in the museum collections. National Associate memberships again rose sharply from just over 900,000 in June 1975 to about 1,300,000 in the Transition

order catalogue. Improved results, however, are anticipated for the future, particularly with the completion of all the Shops, including those in the National Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of Natural History.
The unrestricted funds derived from all of these various programs have been used to cover Institutional administrative costs, to continue a program of small research grants, and to benefit the individual bureaux which share in the income from the concessions, Shops, and Product Development Program. The Associates, school children, and other visitors have benefited during the past year from the addition of new facilities in the Natural History Building. Income from the unrestricted funds enabled the Institution to take another step in its high-priority program of increasing its relatively small unrestricted-purpose endowment funds. With the addition

of $1,750,000 during the 15-month period, these unrestricted endowment funds now total approximately $7.5 million.
Special Purpose Funds, shown separately in Tables 2 and 6, include gifts and other income received directly by individual bureaux for their general use or set aside by Smithsonian management from general unrestricted funds for bureau programs or other specific uses. Income to these funds shown in Table 6 totaling $1,420,000 in this period is only that portion received directly—from gifts, for example, or from Zoo parking receipts reserved for future expansion of its parking facilities, or from miscellaneous sales, performing arts admissions and rentals. Including funds from such items as interest payments and sharing of shop proceeds, royalties and concessions earnings, total income to these Special Purpose Funds in this period equaled $2,665,000 and expenditures $1,248,000. The balance in these funds as of September 30, 1976, was $2,488,000, compared to $1,071,000 on June 30, 1975 (see Balance Sheet on page 58 of this report).
A major portion of Smithsonian trust funds is restricted to specific bureaux or activities by designation. During fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter, the Institution received $7,788,000 of these restricted funds. Of this total, $2,137,000 was income from Restricted Endowment Funds, $4,965,000 was gifts and grants from individuals, foundations, and corporations, and $686,000 represented miscellaneous receipts, such as those from sales desks, benefits, and membership fees.
The major units receiving these funds are shown in Table 9. The Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau were both provided for in large measure by endowment dedicated to their use; the other restricted endowments, detailed more fully below, support a wide range of projects throughout the Institution. Principal activities benefiting from gifts and grants during this period include the Maritime Hall project of the National Museum of History and Technology, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Division of Performing Arts (which produced the extended Festival of American Folklife on the Mall), and the Hillwood Museum, which at the end of the fiscal year was transferred to the Marjorie Merriweather Post Foundation of D.C. Gifts and grants also represent a major source of support for programs in other areas, and the Institution is extremely grateful for this public sup-

The Archives of American Art, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, and the Freer Gallery of Art also support their activities through such fund-raising efforts as auctions and tours, as well as sales desks, which are included under miscellaneous receipts.
Generous support was also received during the year for the renovation of the Carnegie Mansion of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. Due in great measure to a matching grant in this period from the Carnegie Corporation, as well as a gift from Mr. Henry J. Heinz II, the Museum was able to open to the public in October 1976. A welcome and specific bequest from the Estate of Dr. Ivy A. Pelzman allowed us to construct a glockenspiel in the National Zoological Park.

consists of the Freer Fund, whose income supports the operation of the Freer Gallery of Art, Endowment Fund No. 3, used for oceanographic research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida, and a great number of smaller restricted and unrestricted funds (listed in Table 13) for a variety of research and museum projects. Unrestricted endowment funds totaled $7,477,000, or 17 percent of the total. Separate accounting records are, of course, maintained on each of these various endowments, but for investment purposes they have been pooled since June 1, 1974, into the one fund. Market values of the Consolidated Endowment Fund since 1972 are shown in Table 11.
Financial Report / 45

<<<Page: 56>>>

The investment management of the endowment funds of the Institution, with the exception of $1,000,000 on permanent deposit and the miscellaneous securities, is conducted by three professional advisory firms, under the close surveillance of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer, and is subject to policy guidelines set by the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents. As described in prior reports, the Institution follows the total return policy, adopted by the Board of Regents in 1972, under which income is paid by each individual endowment fund at the annual rate of 41/2 percent of the running 5-year average of market values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital.
As indicated previously, the Smithsonian in this last fiscal period was able to transfer $1,750,000 from current unrestricted income into endowment funds, in furtherance of its goal to increase such funds to a level more in proportion to the present operations of the Institution. Every effort will be made to continue this practice in future years.
The changes in the Consolidated Endowment Funds over the past 15 months, due to transfers, reinvestment of income, donations, and values in the securities markets, are shown in Table 12. The increase in market value during this period indicates a market performance roughly in line with the major market indexes. Income of $2,467,000, net of managers’ and custodial fees, was paid out during the 15-month period under the total return policy; this was $565,000 greater than the $1,902,000 from dividends and interest yield. A breakdown of the income to the various funds participating in the Consolidated Endowment Funds is shown in Table 13, together with the book and market values of these funds. Table 10 provides detail on the types of securities held by the Institution. A listing of the individual investments held in the Consolidated Endowment Funds at September 30, 1976, may be obtained upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution.
The nonfederal Trust Funds of the Institution are audited annually by independent public accountants as they have been at the direction of the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents since 1909. Their report for fiscal year 1976 and the Transition Quarter
46 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 57>>>

is contained in the following pages, including a comparative balance sheet and a statement of the changes in various fund balances.
The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit on grant and contract moneys received from federal agencies. In addition, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are subject to audit by the General Accounting Office which, at year’s end, was conducting a general review of Smithsonian finances. The internal audit staff continued its program of selective audits during the year, contributing to continued improvements in administrative
and financial management.

The Board of Regents Smithsonian Institution:
We have examined the balance sheet of the Trust Funds (formerly designated as Private Funds) of Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1976 and the related statement of changes in fund balances for the fifteen months then ended. Such statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments, bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under Federal appropriations as detailed in note 2 to the financial statements. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution at September 30, 1976 and the changes in its fund balances for the fifteen months then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

a. The statement of changes in fund balances reflects transactions for the fifteen months ended September 30, 1976, as a result of a change in the Institution’s fiscal year from June 30 to September 30.
b. Accrual Basis—The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution—Trust Funds (previously designated as Private Funds) (note 2) have been prepared on the accrual basis, except for depreciation of plant fund assets as explained in note 1(i) below, and are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles included in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit Guide “Audits of Colleges and Universities.”
c. Current funds include capitalized improvements and equipment used in income-producing activities having a net carrying value of $1,069,862 and $597,610 at September 30, 1976 and June 30, 1975, respectively. Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for provisions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers to the plant fund.
Separate sub-fund groups of current unrestricted funds have been reflected in the statement of changes in fund balances for auxiliary activities (representing primarily the revenue and expenditures of the Smithsonian Associates program, including the Smithsonian Magazine, and museum shop sales) and Special Purposes (representing internally segregated funds for certain designated purposes).
d. Fund Accounting—In order to ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of “fund accounting.” This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to specific purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its institutional purposes.
Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be

utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.
While quasi-endowment funds have been established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, receivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.
All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted resources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.
. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition when acquired by gift.
f. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.
. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution’s magazine and associates’ activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the applicable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current unrestricted funds.
. The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide 412% of the five year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received.
. Capitalized improvements and equipment used in income-producing activities purchased with Trust Funds are capitalized in the current unrestricted fund at cost (see note 1(c)), and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years. Depreciation expense of $186,660 for 1976 is reflected in the expenditures of the current funds.
Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not recorded.

All the other land, buildings, fixtures and equipment (principally acquired with Federal funds), works of art, living or other specimens are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
j. The agency funds group consists of funds held by the Institution as custodian or fiscal agent for others.
k. Pension costs are funded as accrued.
l. The Institution has a number of contracts with the U. S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract revenues are recognized as expenditures are incurred.
2. Related Activities
The Trust Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, from Federal grants and contracts and from certain activities related to the operations of the Institution.
Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements, provide major support for the operations and administration of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s many museums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for the fifteen months ended September 30, 1976 and the twelve months ended June 30, 1975.

. Pension Plan
The Institution has a contributory pension plan providing for the purchase of retirement annuity contracts for those employees meeting certain age and length of service requirements who elect to be covered under the plan. Under terms of the plan, the Institution contributes the amount necessary to bring the total contribution to 12% of the participants’ compensation subject to social security taxes and to 17% of the participants’ compensation in excess of that amount. The total pension expense for the fifteen months ended September 30, 1976 was $1,404,788.
Income Taxes
The Institution has been recognized as exempt from income taxes as a nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as described in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Recognition of this dual status will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service. Should the Institution’s position not prevail, income taxes in a substantial amount might be imposed on certain income of the Institution, under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code dealing with unrelated business income as defined therein.

Smithsonian Year + 1976 SCIENCE
THE BICENTENNIAL YEAR has brought a greater recognition among the general public of our common heritage; it has also intensified doubts prevalent in this country during the past decade concerning cherished ideas and institutions. Many organizations and beliefs have adjusted to the times or simply disappeared. Throughout this period of uncertainty and skepticism the Smithsonian has been willing to accept divergent viewpoints and in its research and in its exhibits has adhered to a truthful portrayal of our universe and of man’s role in its development. This is a proper function for the Smithsonian and one which under no circumstances should be abrogated.
Due to its unique nature, the Smithsonian is in a position not only to chronicle the past but to chart the future toward the third century of American development. The conquest of air and space which we celebrate in the new National Air and Space Museum and the work of our own scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge will be instrumental in unlocking the mysteries of the universe. While progress is assuredly slow at times, no one in Philadelphia in 1876 would have thought that today we would have reached the Moon and Mars, with promise that by the last quarter of this century the outposts of our own galaxy and beyond will be accessible.
The serious question of our ability to sustain life on earth at the time of our Tricentennial is a problem to which we must address ourselves. Depletion of our floral and faunal heritage is of particular concern to the National Zoological Park and the National Museum of Natural History. It is hoped that with increased atten-

<<<Page: 76>>>

tion and research on endangered species, especially through programs at the Zoo’s Conservation and Research Center and the National Museum of Natural History’s Department of Botany, we will be able eventually to repatriate such species to the wild with practical plans for their rational management.
Health problems continue to plague the world, and scientists at our Tropical Research Institute are studying how the life cycle and behavior of tropical wild animals relate to human health. Studies have already linked the sloth as a possible vector in the spread of a form of encephalitis and yellow fever. In conjunction with health officials, our scientists hope to provide clues which will solve the riddle of these debilitating diseases. At our Radiation Biology Laboratory, scientists are studying the problems of ultraviolet light and its relationship to skin cancer and plant growth. Further research on ultraviolet light should lead to greater food production and lessen the risk of skin cancer.
While we in science will always have our critics and be tempted to explore fleeting trends, our hope, and that of the country in our third century, is to be concerned with the long term. Through the stabilizing influence of such institutions as the Smithsonian, our society is protected against temporarily fashionable research, so that, thanks to our firm resolve, forthcoming generations may expect a better world and the realization of many of the dreams of our forefathers.
Center for the Study of Man
Research on American Indian problems has been a prime activity over the past year at the Center for the Study of Man. Investigation of the American Indian ecumenical movement continued, with invited attendance at the Southwest Regional Meeting at the Navajo Community College and at the general meeting on the Stony Indian Reserve in Morley, Canada. The Center was also represented by invitation at the first meeting of the Fourth World Tribal Peoples in Port Alberni, British Columbia, Canada.
The Handbook of North American Indians is a comprehensive encyclopedia written from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and linguistics. Hundreds of scholars from all over the world

<<<Page: 77>>>

have submitted articles for this twenty-volume work, which is now being assembled by a staff under General Editor William C. Sturtevant, Curator of North American Ethnology in the National Museum of Natural History.
Most volumes will be studies of tribal culture and history by area, e.g., the Northeast, the Southwest, and the Plains. Several others are thematically organized, e.g., technology and the visual arts, and the history of Indian-White relations. Volumes on California and the Northeast are expected to appear in 1977.
Founded a year ago by Dr. E. Richard Sorenson “as a means to forge beyond the too narrow view of the human condition as biological organization or collections of artifacts,” the National Anthropological Film Center is now taking advantage of the scholarly potential of the visual media to explore and reveal the range of human qualities and behavior in our diverse and changing world. Bridging science and the humanities, it draws upon the materials and methods of both.
Research this year centered on Dr. Sorenson’s Study of Child Behavior and Human Development in Cultural Isolates. As patterns of behavior and interaction take hold of and mold a growing child, they can reveal how basic human potential may respond to various conditions of life and how the patterned responses characteristic of a culture emerge.
Using techniques of phenomenological inquiry developed by Dr. Sorenson to obtain data suitable for study without first having to decide what might be important or significant, the Center is now examining child behavior and human development in isolated societies in New Guinea, Brazil, Micronesia, Afghanistan, and Mexico.
To sample as broad a range of human expression as possible, a World Ethnographic Film Sample is being planned to preserve examples of the range and variety of human life. Bodies of film already made are being searched out, and new collaborative film studies of existing cultural survivals are aimed at filling the gaps in the range of cultural expressions of humankind. Special attention is being given to threatened social and cultural enclaves which represent vanishing or changing expressions of human organization and behavior.

With great freedom bestowed on them to explore objects and places at will, the Fore children of New Guinea reacted to unanticipated, new, or surprising occurrences by seeking bodily association with others—similarly to the way they learned new things as infants. To Fore infants and toddlers, this physical contact was a sanctuary of nurture and warmth, in which curiosity and interest could be safely maintained. Supplying cues to appropriate response, this sanctuary was also a retreat when the children’s cognitive or response capabilities were overtaxed. Research film analysis by Dr. Sorenson showed this pattern persists throughout childhood. This pattern of response to the novel or unknown left the freely ranging young child relatively safe in his exploratory quests. His automatic reaction to novelty was to approach it in the company of a “more knowledgeable” hamlet-mate. (Photo credit: E. Richard Sorenson)

A National Research Film Collection is being developed as a means of preserving the irreplaceable film records which document divergent expressions of human potential, organization, and behavior in natural, social, and cultural contexts.
A temperature/humidity-controlled film vault has been installed, thanks to a gift from Drs. Jerry and Lucy Waletzky and the National Endowment for the Humanities; and the developing film collection is now being preserved at 40° F. and 35 percent relative humidity. The capacity of the vault—2,500,000 feet of 16 mm film— will allow continued accessioning for several years.
This year, 312,538 feet of film were accessioned into the National Research Film Collection, bringing the total number of feet to 554,338. This growing body of irreplaceable documents represents aspects of life in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Brazil, the Cook Islands, Ghana, India, Mexico, Micronesia, Nepal, New Guinea, the New Hebrides, and the United States.
In an effort to improve location and identification of existing anthropological films and to help establish priorities for urgent anthropological filming, a central National Union Catalog of anthropological films is being developed. Anthropological film historian Emilie de Brigard is organizing this catalog so that it will be compatible with existing indexes to the anthropological literature and ethnological collections.
Developed from the small Ethnofilm Training Program for Developing Nations initiated two years ago by a grant from the WennerGren Foundation, the Ethnofilm Training Program has been designed to train students to obtain film samples, suitable for research, of human behavior of vanishing and changing cultures. Based on the belief that individuals from other cultures enrich such samples, because of their different, often more expert, cultural perceptions, the Program purposely involves members of non-Western cultures.
The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies (res) was founded in 1973 as a unit within the Smithsonian Institution’s Center for the Study of Man. The mission of ries includes research, dissemination, stimulation, and facilitation of interdisciplinary

study, and consultative services on the broad range of knowledge of United States immigration.
RIES is unique among institutions studying immigration in at least two ways: (1) stress on the new immigrants entering the United States since 1965, and (2) explicit inclusion of American extraterritorial jurisdictions among those topics studied. Such a focus complements the Research Institute’s goal of achieving a fuller understanding of the new immigration, its patterns and characteristics, and its ongoing impact on American society and discernible implications for the future of the international community.
Since its inception, the Research Institute has provided consultative services, been host to and advised research fellows, and sponsored activities aimed at fostering in-depth study of issues related to international migration, ethnicity, development, and other critical areas, as they influence domestic and international relations. Within the Smithsonian, rues personnel have contributed to the activities of the Interdisciplinary Communications Program, the Division of Performing Arts, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Office of Symposia and Seminars, the Smithsonian Associates program, and the Office of Academic Studies.
Planning and evaluative services have also been provided to public and private organizations concerned with national and international programs and activities. Among these organizations are:
Association of Caribbean Universities and Research Institutes (UNICA) Carnegie Foundation
Ford Foundation
House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs
National Endowment for the Humanities
National Institute of Mental Health
National Urban League
Organization of American States
Phelps-Stokes Fund, Washington Bureau
In observance of the Bicentennial, many Smithsonian Institution units have emphasized such subjects as immigration, ethnicity, cultural pluralism in the evolution of American society, and technological and cultural developments. ries has been one of the few units within the Smithsonian Institution to stress a truly contempo-

rary phenomenon—post-1965 immigration to the United States and its various implications.
As its contribution to the Bicentennial, rmes has planned a twoyear activity aimed at the convening of a national conference on the new immigration to the United States and the publication of a technically definitive volume on the same subject. The conference will combine public panel discussions and selective scholarly seminars. The panels will discuss policy issues, such as refugees and illegals, and will present progress reports on research concerning policy-oriented aspects of the new immigration. The scholars will participate in two sequences of seminars, on international and domestic implications of the new migration. In addition to national and international dignitaries, key participants will include important academicians, researchers, and policymakers.
In order to realize more effectively its goals for the Bicentennial, ruES has established regional ad hoc committees of individuals to assist the rues staff in the design of the Bicentennial program. These individuals are highly respected professionals from the diplomatic

corps, private industry, academia, government, and other public international and national agencies, as well as public-interest groups. They are chosen on the basis of reputation for knowledge of relevant literature, professional experience, or participation in the new immigration. These ad hoc advisory committees embody many racial and ethnic groups and, as an added dimension, bring to bear interdisciplinary viewpoints on the formulation of programs or activities. In addition to Washington, D.C., sites visited by the ries staff as part of its work with these groups were: Miami, Florida; San Juan, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Camp Pendleton, California; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
As part of its preliminary activities for the Bicentennial, r1Es planned a series of mini-conferences. These mini-conferences had several objectives: to stimulate cross-country enthusiasm for the general topic; to identify prospective participants and subthemes; and to establish working ties with organizations and agencies with special interest in the new immigration.
rues also sponsored selected individuals to participate in panel discussions on “International Immigration as a Policy Issue,” held at the International Studies Association’s Annual Convention in Toronto, Canada. The ries session, which stressed Western Hemisphere immigration, included papers on the comparison of United States and Canadian immigration policies, Third World immigration, and analyses of Caribbean emigration and immigration.
Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies
In the spring of 1976, Dr. J. Kevin Sullivan was appointed Director of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies (csces). Before joining the Smithsonian Institution in 1971, Dr. Sullivan spent seven years with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Michigan, where he was involved in environmental studies on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.
Associate Directors for Science and Education were also appointed in 1976. Dr. David Correll, formerly a research chemist at the Smithsonian Institution’s Radiation Biology Laboratory, was named Associate Director for Scientific Programs, and Dr. John

<<<Page: 83>>>

Falk, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, was named Associate Director for Education Programs.
Activities at the Chesapeake Bay Center include ecological research and education programs. Principal themes in research include comparative ecology of terrestrial communities, with emphasis on the effects of past land use. Estuarine research is concerned with the response of biological populations to physical and chemical factors. The integration of these two programs is accomplished by an extensive program of monitoring and analysis of runoff from the Rhode River watershed through a system of permanent gauging stations.
The long-range goal of the Upland Ecology Subprogram is to gain a better understanding of the comparative ecology of the various land uses found on the Rhode River watershed. This past year’s participants in the Upland Ecology Subprogram, led by J. Lynch and B. Tremper, are concentrating their efforts on the characterization of nine intensive-study sites, each of which is 1 to 10 hectares in size. These sites were selected on the basis of past land use, time period since abandonment, and the types of plant communities presently found on the sites. This research is supplemented by a land-use history project in which deed records and oral histories are being used to develop a detailed understanding of past land-use practices on sites undergoing contemporary comparative research, The investigations are analyzing population data on birds, small mammals, ants, understory arthropods, and litter arthropods.
These study sites are representative of successional stages. For example, two sites have never been clearcut or burned since colonization in the 1650s. Both are characteristic of mature plant communities.
In comparison, another site is a previously cultivated field which was abandoned only six years ago. The soils of this site are relatively low in nitrogen.
In addition to these baseline studies on the animal and plant communities of each site, Dr. Correll and his colleagues are beginning to examine the mechanisms underlying observed distributional patterns. Rates of nutrient depletion and pH decrease when land is abandoned from agriculture are being studied. An experiment in-

One species responsible for a dense dinoflagellate bloom in the Rhode River estuary was identified as Prorocentrum mariae-lebouriae. This scanning electron micrograph shows its almost spherical, strongly compressed, saucer-shape. Its surface has an evenly distributed pattern of small projections and ridges at the cell periphery.
volving the manipulation of nutrient availability in an old forest has also been designed, and preliminary survey data are being gathered. One goal of this study is to determine whether mineral nutrient limitations are the restricting factor for plant species composition and animal population size in southern Maryland forests. In addition to studies of the upland sites in the Rhode River Watershed, Dr. Patricia Mehlhop has also been conducting studies on small-mammal distribution at the Poplar Islands. Owned and administered by the Smithsonian, these small islands are located 2 miles off the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in the Chesapeake Bay. In 1973, Dr. Mehlhop and Sheila Minor surveyed the islands for small mammals. They found mammal diversity and populations to be very low. Meadow voles were found on two Poplar Islands, and Norway rats were found on one. Later in 1973, the Norway rat became extinct. Interviews with past residents indicated that other mammals, such as squirrels and mice, had once inhabited Poplar.

In the watershed subprogram, Drs. Correll, Pierce, Faust, and Wu are measuring mass balances for a series of parameters on subwatersheds which vary in size from 2 hectares (5 acres) to 1000 ha (2500 acres). A major goal is to determine how land management, climate, and other factors influence the movement of materials from a watershed into an estuary.
The watershed of the Rhode River is composed of small basins which drain directly or through creeks into the estuary. The basins have been mapped according to land use, and instrumented sampling stations have been constructed to monitor the runoff from each basin. These stations record the volume of water discharged while taking volume-integrated samples. The runoff is analyzed for organic matter, nutrients, bacteria, sediment, cations (including heavy metals), and pesticides. Rainwater is also collected and analyzed.
Analysis of the 1974 data revealed the following findings:
1. For the entire year, runoff from residential land contained more nitrogen and phosphorus per unit area than runoff from any other land-use type. Cultivated cropland had the second highest yield rate for these nutrients. The nutrient yield rates for forests were consistently low throughout the year.
2. Rainwater deposited more nitrogen in the estuary than upland runoff. For example, rain deposited 4.1 tons of nitrogen in the estuary, compared to 3.7 tons of nitrogen from land runoff.
3. Cropland and pasture are not exporting most of the incoming loads of nitrogen to the Rhode River. Substantial amounts are probably lost to the atmosphere as nitrogen, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. On the average, farmers applied 0.16 lb. N/acre day to cultivated land and 0.13 lb. N/acre day to pasturelands. The yearly average loading rates of nitrogen from cropland and pasture were 0.011 Ib. N/acre day and 0.0085 lb. N/acre day, respectively.
4. Residential land had the highest loading rate of sediment for the year, followed by cultivated cropland, pastureland, and forestland.
5. Freshwater upland wet areas were found to be nutrient and sediment sinks; average loading rates for wet areas, especially in the spring and summer, were negative.
6. Fecal coliform concentrations in the Rhode River exceeded standards for shellfish waters at certain times of the year. This

contamination was entirely from runoff and from drainage areas, with average densities of only 1.6 animals/acre and 0.8 persons/ acre.
The watershed program is funded by the National Science Foundation-Research Applied to National Needs (NsF-RANN) through the Chesapeake Research Consortium and by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The goal of the estuarine subprogram is to develop a more adequate understanding of the relationship between biological populations of an estuary and physical/chemical factors. Some of the more advanced research projects in this subprogram focus on phosphorus cycling and flux in an estuarine environment.
David Correll and Maria Faust have been investigating the role of microorganisms in phosphorus cycling. In their research, they attempted to distinguish phosphorus-uptake by algae from that by bacteria in an estuarine community. Using a differential filtration technique to separate the bacterial population from the phytoplankton, they measured the phosphorus-uptake of each. Monthly sampling was carried out in the main basin of the Rhode River estuary from March 1973 through February 1974.
The results of these experiments indicated the relative contribution of algae and bacteria to phosphorus-uptake with the season. During the period from August to May, phosphorus was assimilated mostly by bacteria, and the algal contribution to phosphorusuptake was less than 6 percent. During June and July, phosphorusuptake by algae increased to 9 percent and 42 percent of total phosphorus-uptake, respectively. The bacteria’s higher phosphorusuptake throughout the year clearly indicated the importance of bacteria as a major recycler of phosphorus in the estuarine environment.
Nutrient-flux experiments have also been conducted in tidal marshes. During 1974, various levels of phosphate were applied to a high and low marsh in the Rhode River for a period of three to four months. Samples of plant leaves, surface detrital materials, and sediment cores at various depth were analyzed for the amount and specific activity of various phosphorus fractions. Since the nutrient loading included nitrogen in the form of ammonia and nitrate, core samples were also analyzed for total nitrogen composition.
76 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 87>>>

An important implication of these results is that the contention that marshes have considerable value as nutrient-removal systems appears to be unfounded, at least for the medium salinity marshes of the Chesapeake Bay.
Another project by M. Faust focused on the survival of Escherichia coli MC-6, a bacterium of fecal origin, in an estuarine environment. The effects were measured of physical parameters on E. coli survival in diffusion chambers placed in the Rhode River. Data were collected to evaluate the combined efforts of time, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and montmorillonite (a type of clay particle) on coliform survival.
During 1976, csces continued to initiate and expand programs aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of outdoorcentered environmental education.
Initiated in 1975, the teacher-led tour program was designed to provide children with outdoor experiences which reinforced or introduced science concepts. The Center worked closely with the local Anne Arundel County School System to develop the following teacher-led activities: ‘“Micro-Trails, Macro-Trails’” for the first grade; “Animal Adaptations: Insects and Spiders” for the second and third grades; “Community Comparison: Forest and Old Field” and “Estuary Chesapeake” for the fifth and sixth grades; and “Seeing the Trees for the Forest: A Census Activity” for the seventh and eighth grades. Each activity is outlined in a brochure that includes background information for the teacher, objectives for the students, a step-by-step procedure section for the class, and suggested follow-up activities.
During the summer of 1976, the Summer Ecology Program was expanded and restructured to emphasize community-centered learning. For the first time, the Program was conducted in eight different locations instead of the Center’s research facility. This new approach helped familiarize children with the human and natural ecologies of their own communities.

setting. Each participant receives a small stipend, plus living accommodations and may arrange to receive academic credit for work completed at the Center.
Seventeen students were selected to participate in the Program during the first year. They worked with csces’s professional staff on projects in estuarine and terrestrial ecology, land-use management, and environmental education.
Another major objective of the Education Program is to convey the Center’s scientific research findings to management agencies and the general public. Recently, public groups have been especially interested in obtaining information on the extent of nonpoint source pollution from land runoff. Since nonpoint sources of pollution are measured and evaluated in the Center’s Watershed Research Program, special efforts were made in 1975-1976 to disseminate the Center’s watershed findings to the public.
In June 1975, the Center began publishing Rhode River Review, a newsletter which summarized on-going cBcEs research projects and activities on a bimonthly basis. Each issue covers major developments in the science and education programs and describes staff activities. Feature articles are also included on csces’s research findings and Bay-wide environmental issues. The newsletter has proved to be a major means of communication with the surrounding community and other regional, state, and national organizations.
Under a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the Center provided support in the form of staff time and expertise to citizen organizations throughout the Chesapeake Bay region. Support activities for these groups included organizing workshops and conferences, developing technical information on environmental issues, and helping achieve citizen participation in landand waterquality planning.
In January 1976, ceces planned and organized a major conference on Water Quality Goals for the Chesapeake Bay. Existing waterquality conditions in the Bay were described and governmental officials outlined federal and state programs that deal with waterquality problems in this region. The role of the citizen in achieving water-quality goals was also explored.
In 1976, cBces acquired a 32-foot diesel work boat from the Fort Pierce Bureau of the Smithsonian Institution in Florida.

Fort Pierce Bureau
The Fort Pierce Bureau has continued to stress its three long-term programs, as part of a consortium effort with the Harbor Branch Foundation, Incorporated, to study the estuarine and marine environments along Florida’s east-central coast and adjacent continental shelf. These programs are: the Indian River Coastal Zone Study, Life History Studies, and Submersible Exploration of the East Florida Continental Slope. The initial purpose of these investigations is to accumulate baseline information by making an inventory of the aquatic biota and by assessing the environment and sources of pollution, in order to predict natural and man-caused changes in the Indian River lagoon and offshore continental shelf.
This past year the Bureau added five personnel to its scientific staff; initiated a predoctoral/postdoctoral fellowship program; provided an electron-microscope facility for the Life Histories Section for Ultrastructural Studies; and remodeled the Smithsonian’s Butler Building to accommodate eight offices, an air-conditioned room for the reference collection of preserved specimens, and a ventilated area for the gross sorting of samples.
The Indian River Coastal Zone Study is investigating the ecological role of the two primary production bases of the estuary, the seagrasses with their epiphytes and the phytoplankton. During the past year, 79,000 benthic invertebrates have been collected quantitatively from experimental seagrass stations and analyzed for information on community structure. Data indicate that benthic invertebrates associated with seagrasses of the Indian River are heavily preyed upon, and are extremely important to the overall food web of the estuarine ecosystem. A total of 278 fish collections have added 47 species for waters shallower than 200 meters. An innovative drop net was developed to determine fish biomass and densities and to compare seagrass-bed community changes with respect to water depth. The coastal sabellariid worm reefs of the Indian River region were found to have associated decapod and stomatopod crustacean communities, consisting of about ninety-six species. Grass shrimps were found to form a major component of the seagrass and drift-algae communities.
The Life Histories Program has continued to accumulate baseline

information on the critical stages in reproduction and development of the common species in the region, for potential utilization in assessments of environmental stresses and modifications on populations of marine organisms. This knowledge of developmental pattern is basic for evaluation of the effects of environmental factors on marine animals, for individuals with highly vulnerable planktonic larvae are predictably more susceptible to the effects of pollutants than those with direct development and no planktonic stages. Three specialized techniques were devised for the Program this year: a quantitative sampling device for collecting sand-dwelling sipunculans and polychaetes for population analyses; a culturing technique to rear successfully planktonic sipunculan larvae, through metamorphosis to adulthood; and a procedure for preparing onemicron-thick serial sections of larvae and embryos embedded in plastic resins. Six different sipunculan larvae, representing four genera, were reared to sexual maturity in the laboratory. One of these, common to oceanic plankton, was reared to adulthood and spawned gametes which developed to the second larval stage—the first-known instance of the successful culturing of a sipunculan larva to a gamete-producing mature adult.
The Submersible Exploration of the East Florida Continental Shelf has continued to carry out its dual functions of reconnaissance and contribution to the inventory bank of continental-shelf organisms. Eleven of 14 proposed east-west transects, from 100 feet to 1000 feet in depth, were completed between Lake Worth and Cape Canaveral. These transects have traversed a total of 260 kilometers during 68 transect and local reconnaissance dives. Forty-nine lockout dives between 60 feet and 212 feet have collected 97 plant species, including at least 6 new records and 2 undescribed species; about 230 different invertebrates; and 27 fish species, of which 5 are new records. Many species of organisms were observed which were not collected.

On opening day, July 1, 1976, President Ford and Vice President Rockefeller arrived at the west door of the Museum, where they were greeted by Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and Museum Director Michael Collins. The party toured the Museum and emerged onto the Mall terrace for the ribbon-cutting ceremony just as the Air Force precision flying team, the Thunderbirds, made a third salutatory flight over Jefferson Drive.

After the presentation of colors by the Joint Services Color Guard, welcoming speeches were made. Referring to the Museum as “a perfect birthday present from the American people to themselves,” President Ford dedicated the building.
Symbolically the ribbon for the opening ceremony was bright red, white, and blue, and stretched between the jaws of a replica Viking spacecraft soil-sampling mechanism similar to one that was to dig on the surface of Mars a few weeks later. The taut ribbon awaited not a snip of the scissors but a signal from the Viking spacecraft approaching Mars.
After an 18-minute journey of more than 200 million miles, the signal from Mars arrived at the Museum, causing the soil-sampling

arm to retract. The ribbon fluttered to the ground, burned in half by a hot metal coil in the mechanism.
The completed Museum was then open for the first time. Visitors came at such rates that the millionth visitor was welcomed only twenty-five days after the door opened and the two millionth after only seven weeks.
July 1, 1976, marked not only the opening of the Museum but also the completion of the preparation period of the inaugural exhibition. The effort involved appears to have been by far the largest single museum-exhibit development program in history, encompassing twenty-three major galleries, two presentation centers, and a number of smaller areas. Under the direction of Michael Collins, this program was supervised by Melvin B. Zisfein, Deputy Director of the Museum. Included in this effort were the development of basic concepts for each gallery; the preparation of all written material (such as all label and audiovisual scripts) needed for gallery design; the development of conceptual and detail designs; development of all fabrication drawings and specifications; programming and recording of all presentations; preparation of all plans; and fabrication and installation of all exhibit units.
The galleries and presentation centers that were opened to the public on July 1, 1976, occupy a floorspace of some 230,000 square feet on two exhibit levels. The galleries are listed below:
Gallery 100 Gallery 102 Gallery 103 Gallery 104 Gallery 105 Gallery 106 Gallery 107 Gallery 108 Gallery 109 Gallery 110 Gallery 111 Gallery 112 Gallery 113 Gallery 114 Gallery 203

Most of the design of these galleries was initiated in fiscal years 1974 and 1975, while most of the fabrication occurred in fiscal year 1976. All gallery concepts were developed internally; numerous outside firms, however, were placed under contract to perform portions of the detail design and fabrication.
The nasm exhibits design and fabrication program was closely managed by an internal group chaired by the Deputy Director and representing all phases of museum operation. A comprehensive activity-by-activity schedule was developed for each gallery and a Coordinator was assigned to each for control of all administrative aspects of the gallery development program. Items requiring action
Over three million visitors thronged the new National Air and Space Museum during the first three months after its July 1, 1976, opening.

were assigned each week and accounted for the following week. The entire program was completed within budget and several days ahead of schedule.
To maximize the reliability and ease of maintenance of the audiovisual and electromechanical portions of the exhibits, a Museum Automatic Control Center System (mMaccs) was developed. Contained in a climate-controlled room in the basement of the Museum, MAccs is designed to: (1) feed audio and video programs to all galleries as required; (2) provide switching logic to all exhibit units (such as automated shows) requiring it; and (3) maintain a diagnostic surveillance of all exhibit areas to detect malfunctions such as film break, delamping, loss of synchronization, overheating, etc., and activate a malfunction print-out and alarm when a malfunction signal is received.
maccs is the only facility of its kind in the world. Its use has resulted in the need for a maintenance staff approximately one-half to one-quarter that of an equivalent museum not comparably equipped.
All of the nasm Departments contributed to the central gallery, Number 100, Milestones of Flight—the premier gallery in the National Air and Space Museum. Only the most highly significant flight vehicles in the national collection qualify for inclusion in this gallery. Special recognition is accorded the 1903 Wright Flyer, the first airplane capable of sustained powered, controlled, manned flight. Also in the Gallery are such historic flight vehicles as The Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, and spacecraft such as the Friendship 7, Gemini 4, and Columbia, the Apollo 11 command module that orbited the moon during the first manned lunar exploration. Also on exhibit is a lunar rock that visitors can examine and touch.
During 1976, the Departments of Aeronautics, Astronautics, and Science and Technology devoted their major efforts to the completion of those galleries pertaining to the respective Department’s specialties. Between July 1, 1975, and July 1, 1976, galleries developed from the concept and unit script stage to completion. In addition to their normal tasks of research and writing, many curators from the Departments were assigned the job of coordinating the efforts of the firms engaged in the design and construction of the exhibits.

Members of the Presentations and Education Division worked with other Smithsonian employees to: (1) organize and begin an education program; (2) equip, staff, program, and begin operation of the Albert Einstein Spacearium; and (3) equip, staff, and put into operation a highly specialized projection theater. All of these programs went into full operation the day the Museum opened.
The year began with twenty-three volunteers in the Education Unit. Recruitment during the fall of 1975 multiplied this corps of enthusiastic and capable people by a factor of ten. During the first half of 1976, 230 recruits completed the training program. About two-thirds of them have worked or now work as professionals in aerospace fields. Some are pilots; others are aerospace managers, scientists, engineers, journalists, and educators; still others are airtraffic control workers.
Volunteers served in many ways, including assisting in offices, library work, cataloguing, care and storage of collections, exhibit preparation, public information, and museum teaching.
During the past year considerable progress was made in helping handicapped visitors enjoy the Museum. A full-time coordinator of programs for the handicapped was hired. The philosophy has been to integrate handicapped visitors into all parts of the Museum rather than to have special exhibits for them. Groups such as the National Federation of the Blind, the National Association of the Physically Handicapped, and the National Association of the Deaf have been of great help in this effort.
Wherever possible the building has been designed or modified as a barrier-free environment for the physically handicapped. Various implements and materials have been and will continue to be developed for handicapped visitors. For example, mirrors with universal clamps that will attach to any wheelchair are available for persons who have little or no head movement. There are two teletype machines: one for use in the Education Office for answering inquiries from deaf persons, the other for use in the public areas for communicating with deaf visitors.
Blind persons may obtain copies of the nasm and Smithsonian brochures in either braille, large print, or on cassette tape. These sell for the same price as the regular printed editions. A building model of the Museum, marked in braille and in print, is located in the Lobby, and cassette tours of Museum galleries are provided to-

gether with a list of touchable objects. Raised-line drawings have been produced and may be borrowed by blind visitors.
On June 1, 1976, the Smithsonian Institution received a grant of $74,000 from the United States Office of Education to develop a set of guidelines for establishing museum programs for handicapped students. The nasM Education Unit directed the grant on behalf of the Institution, with participation by the National Museum of History and Technology, the National Museum of Natural History, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Other research programs, including evaluation of NaAsm galleries and presentation centers, are in the planning stages.
Volunteers have been given special training in presenting tours to groups that include handicapped individuals. A comprehensive bibliography of books that are available in braille or talking-book form has been compiled with the cooperation of the Washington, D.C. Public Library and the Library of Congress. In addition, a growing collection of tape-recorded material on air and space subjects is available in the Museum library.
The Education Unit arranged and conducted a number of special lectures. One lecture series, the Noon-Time Air and Space Forum, consisted of fifteen lectures presented by selected authorities in aviation and space science. This series began in September 1975 and continued monthly through May 1976. In past years these lectures have not been given during the summer months. This year, however, a special set of lectures, arranged with the help of the Goddard Space Flight Center, was held twice monthly, beginning in July 1976.
On December 22, 1975, the second Annual Holiday Lecture Series for high school students was given. The lectures, presented by three noted space scientists, were on the theme of “The Planets” and were supported by the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation. During 1972 and again in 1974, two complementary series of astronomy lectures were co-sponsored by nasM and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. A third series started in the fall of 1976 was titled ‘““New Windows to the Universe.”
The Albert Einstein Spacearium
Prior to the middle of this century, various individuals and groups began attempts to establish a major planetarium in the city of

Washington. The opening of the Albert Einstein Spacearium is the culmination of these interests.
During the fall of 1975 a Carl Zeiss Model VI planetarium instrument was installed in the Spacearium. This instrument, together with funds for automation of the Spacearium system, was a Bicentennial gift from the Federal Republic of Germany to the people of the United States. An interesting feature of the facility is a foreign language system that will allow visitors to hear programs in French, German, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as English.
The first Spacearium show, “Cosmic Awakening,” is a 42-minute look at how human perception of the universe has changed over the past two-hundred years. This multi-media show uses hundreds of audiovisual effects, including the Zeiss projector, to illustrate the sun, moon, planets, stars, and galaxies and mankind’s increasing comprehension of them. The automated show is narrated by Burgess Meredith, with music by William Penn of the Eastman School of Music.
The Spacearium is also used for education programs that are related to Museum-guided school activities.
Even though the Spacearium opened with the rest of the Museum on July 1, 1976, it was officially dedicated on July 15. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany presented the planetarium system and its control system to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who received the gift for the American people. A new composition, Sirius, written by the noted German composer KarlHeinz Stockhausen, was given its world premiere during the dedication ceremony. A beautiful gleaming glass sculpture, containing an intaglio of Albert Einstein, was especially designed and fabricated by Steuben Glass of Corning, New York, to serve as a dedicatory plaque. It is located beside the Spacearium entrance.
The Theater
The theater at the National Air and Space Museum is one of the world’s best equipped projection theaters. It was designed to accommodate an IMAx projector, one of six currently operational in the world. This instrument projects extremely high-quality motion pictures onto a screen 50 feet (five stories) high and 75 feet wide. Facing the screen are 483 seats in amphitheater arrangement. A highquality sound system adds the aural dimension needed to sweep

<<<Page: 102>>>

people into space to explore the accomplishments of flight. This combination of equipment and giant screen helps provide Museum visitors with the experience of flight, increasing their enjoyment and comprehension of the Museum’s artifacts and exhibits.
The premier max film is entitled To Fly. It is a “Bicentennial view of America through flight-oriented eyes.” This Francis Thompson, Inc., production was custom-made for the nasM theater and was provided to the Museum as a public service by the Continental Oil Company. The film was directed and photographed by MacGillivray-Freeman Films of California. It will be shown regularly during Museum hours for at least one year.
The period from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976, was characterized by an extremely high level of activity, directed at moving specimens into the new building, erecting or hanging these, and improving conditions at the Silver Hill storage facility.
The movement of more than 250 major air-and-space artifacts from more than two dozen locations, some as far away as the Soviet Union, presented an immediate scheduling problem. The problem was compounded by the size and weight of some items (the weight of the Orbital Work Shop, for example, exceeded 35 tons); the complexity of others (some with perhaps as many as 100 major components); and the fragility of still others (the Wright Flyer, for example).
The modes of transportation for these items included air, rail, barge, bus, and truck. Truck transportation was determined to be the restricting factor, as Smithsonian trucks were limited in size and had numerous other commitments. This problem was solved when the United States Army at Fort Belvoir agreed to provide trucks, tractors, cranes, and operators for the duration of the move. The Washington, D.C.,and Maryland police readily provided permits and escorts for the movement of large items.
During the entire program, in which more than 1,000 truck shipments were made, more than 150 objects suspended, and numerous artifacts positioned into difficult locations, only one accident occurred, involving relatively minor (and easily repairable) damage to one artifact and no injury to personnel. This accident had a useful side result. Despite the contractor’s primary responsibility, all

future lifts were reviewed by a team chaired by the Deputy Director. As a result, even so complex a task as bringing in the 70,000-pound, 23-foot-diameter Orbital Work Shop (ows) and assembling it to its full 52-foot height, was accomplished safely.
When the restoration effort at the Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Division at Silver Hill, Maryland, approached completion, as much support as possible was directed to the Museum opening.
An evaluation was made of the facility, and a long-range annual program of restoration of four aircraft and preservation of twenty others was determined to be the most useful to the Museum in terms of future exhibit requirements and the management of the collection.
The microfilming of engine materials and biographical materials is almost complete. The project was much more time-consuming than originally envisioned. The space saved by this effort will amount to more than forty-five file-drawer cases. Additional plans are underway to use microfilm to reduce storage space further.
As a result of the various attempts to improve warehousing, and indirectly as a result of model requirements for the new Museum, NASM’s model collection was inventoried and reviewed for expansion and deletion.
The National Air and Space Museum Library staff began the move to the new building on July 14, 1975. The collection of over 22,000 books, 4,600 bound periodicals, and one million documents was shelved and filed. The Library opened its new quarters to the research staff and public one month later in August. When the consolidation of materials from two warehouses and the Arts and Industries nasm collection was made, significant collections were documented. Over 1,000 motion pictures and 800 audio tapes were also moved from a warehouse to the new library.
Special collections include the William A. M. Burden collection of early ballooning books, Russian and German rocketry works, and scarce aeronautica; also, the Bella Landauer aeronautical sheet music collection and her unique collection of children’s books. A valuable 1912 edition of Hike and the Aeroplane by Tom Graham, the pseudonym for Sinclair Lewis, was discovered in the children’s collection.

The Ramsey Room houses rare and scarce aeronautica and astronautica. Included are the aeronautical manuscripts of Samuel Pierpont Langley, James Means, Hiram Maxim, Otto Lilienthal, Octave Chanute, Stephen M. Balzer, the correspondence of Professor Jerome C. Hunsaker, designer of the airship Shenandoah, and the scrapbooks of Captain ““Eddie”” Rickenbacker.
The Ramsey Room furnishings are the gift of Juanita Gabriella Ramsey (1892-1966), who visualized this room as a memorial to her husband and to all persons associated with the science and art of flight. Admiral De Witt Clinton Ramsey (1888-1961) was one of the first naval aviators and holder of the Navy Cross. At one end of the room are portraits of Admiral and Mrs. Ramsey. The painting of the admiral is by the late Thomas E. Stephens; that of Mrs. Ramsey is by Gabriella Koszorus. At the other end of the room are three bronze medallion plaques representative of three forms of manned flight: aerostation (balloons and dirigibles), aviation (all heavier-than-air craft), and astronautics (space flight).

During fiscal year 1976, the following projects were undertaken by the Office of the Curator of Art:
Richard Lippold and Charles O. Perry were commissioned to produce two major sculptures, which, by opening day, were installed outside the entrances to the National Air and Space Museum.
Richard Lippold’s Ad Astra, a 100-foot golden spire penetrating a cluster of silver stars, stands on the sidewalk at the Mall entrance to the Museum. Charles O. Perry’s 16-foot-diameter black bronze Continuum is at the Independence Avenue entrance.
Artists Robert T. McCall and Eric Sloane were asked to decorate 2,100-square-foot walls in the Independence Avenue Lobby of the National Air and Space Museum. Mr. McCall painted The Space Mural: A Cosmic View and Mr. Sloane did The Earth Flight Environment. Because progress went so well on these murals, they became an important factor in the decision to preview the Independence Lobby area to the public beginning on February 2, 1976.
At the same time, the Office of the Curator of Art commissioned two other mural projects: one by Keith Ferris in the World War II gallery, depicting a number of B-17 bombers on a raid over Germany, and the other by Eric Sloane in the General Aviation Gallery, showing a cross section of weather conditions when warm and cold fronts meet.
For the first time, the National Air and Space Museum art collection was brought together from three storage areas to a permanent storage facility within the new Museum. Many of the artworks not on display in the public exhibition areas are either displayed in administrative areas within the Museum or installed upon racks in the new storage rooms.
During fiscal year 1976, about 600 new pieces of art, mostly transferred from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration collection, were accessioned and catalogued.
An art gallery was designed and built during this period, and an inaugural exhibition of 119 pieces of art by 64 artists was opened to the public. Most of the work shown was transferred to the National Air and Space Museum collection from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Also represented in the exhibition was work from the United States Air Force, Department of the Army, and many private lenders and donors. The Metropolitan Museum

of Art lent Richard Lippold’s Variations Within a Sphere: The Sun, Doris Bry lent Georgia O’Keefe’s Blue A, and Stuart M. Speiser lent from his collection a number of photo-realist works of aerospace subjects.
Personnel of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies participated in the creation of the lunar sample display in the “Apollo to the Moon” exhibit. Center personnel were also responsible for the acquisition of one lunar sample that visitors can touch. This particular display has proven very popular with Nas visitors.
Plans were initiated for a new exhibit to deal with space science. The nature of the subject will necessitate the continuous updating of the exhibit as new knowledge is acquired. Since there will be few artifacts to be displayed in such an exhibit, the available space will be used to impart scientific knowledge to Museum visitors.
The Center for Earth and Planetary Studies played an important role in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp). The Research Director of the Center, Dr. Farouk El-Baz, was Principal Investigator for the “Earth Observations and Photography Experiment” on this mission. The objectives of the experiment were for the astronauts to make visual observations from orbit and to obtain photographs of specific Earth features, processes, and phenomena. The experiment was highly successful. A description of performed tasks and acquired data was published in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Preliminary Science Report.
The southeastern Mare Serenitatis area of the Moon has been mapped at a scale of 1:250,000. Data sources included Apollo photographs, analyses of samples from the Apollo 17 site, and results of Apollo orbital geochemical and geophysical sensors. Using structural relationships within this relatively well-studied area of the Moon, it is possible to deduce age relations of other lunar basins and thus further explain their geologic history. The resulting sequences of tectonic events are also applicable to studies of major basins on Mars and Mercury.
Cooperation has continued with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the lunar mapping program. The Center Director attended meetings of the Lunar Photographic and Carto-

graphic Committee to choose sites for future lunar mapping in accordance with the scientific community’s needs, interests, and priorities. Nomenclature data for fourteen new maps at 1:250,000 scale and three large-scale maps (1:50,000 scale or larger) were supplied to the Defense Mapping Agency Topographic Center where the maps are produced. These maps are used in both regional lunar studies and detailed investigations of particular surface features of interest to scientists from several disciplines.
A computer program was devised for the lunar nomenclature file which greatly enhances the Center’s capacity to do statistical work and to retrieve information. The computerized file will be expanded by the addition of scientific details relating to the size, characteristics, and significance of named lunar features. The file will be used by the Advisory Committee on Extraterrestrial Features of the U.S. Department of Interior’s Board of Geographic Names. This committee hopes to establish a system of nomenclature that would be applicable to features of all planetary surfaces in the solar system.
The photographic library of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies has expanded. New acquisitions include Earth photographs from Gemini 3-12, Apollo 6-17, and Apollo-Soyuz: a total of 8,494 new frames. Microfiche catalogues of available imagery of Mars and Mercury will be used to select the best photographs of these planets for acquisition. The photographs will be used in ongoing research in comparative planetology.
National Museum of Natural History
The Bicentennial year saw major improvements and enlargement of the interior of the National Museum of Natural History (NMNu) in an effort to make the public’s visit to the Museum more rewarding. Improved permanent exhibits were created and a variety of new service conveniences were offered, including dining facilities, an escalator, larger lounge areas, centralized restrooms, orientation aids, and classrooms.
“Our Changing Land,” the Museum’s Bicentennial exhibit, opened in November 1975. It focuses on the history of land use in

after they were settled by man and transformed from virginland to farmland and ultimately to urban centers. It will become a permanent ecology hall. Other permanent exhibits that opened in late 1975 and 1976 as part of the Museum’s long-range exhibits-renewal program are: “South America: Continent and Culture,” showing the distinctive environments and resources of four South American regions and the different ways in which cultures have adapted to them during the prehistoric, colonial, and modern eras; ““The Moon: Its Rocks and History,” a large display of moon rocks that tells what scientists have learned from the rocks about the first one-half billion years of planetary evolution; and the “Insect Zoo,” the first such installation in the United States, in which a visitor can view the life-styles of a large array of live insects and their arthropod

relatives and discover why insects are the most successful animals on earth.
With its heavy commitment of space to exhibits, research laboratories, and collections storage, the Museum in the past was never able to find the room for a restaurant and several other sorely needed public services. But in 1975-1976 an imaginative solution to this problem was worked out by fitting a three-level service building within the Museum’s west courtyard. Originally an air and light shaft, the courtyard had become an anachronism in an age of air conditioning and fluorescent lighting, serving only as a site for a small tin storage shed. The new service building constructed in the cleared courtyard adds 45,000 square feet of floor space to the Museum. On the top level, with access from the Museum’s rotunda area, a skylit public dining area for 400 persons and a lounge area are situated next to a shop that specializes in books and items related to natural history. Restrooms are conveniently accessible one flight down on the middle level. Late in 1976 a Naturalist’s Center is scheduled to open on the middle level, designed for amateur naturalists who are interested in handling

and studying natural history specimens. This facility will be operated by the Museum’s Office of Education. On the ground level is a school-tour staging area that includes a conference room and four classrooms—also useful to the Office of Education—and separate employee and Smithsonian Associates dining areas.
In addition to services offered in the west courtyard building, the record crowds of visitors to the Museum during the latter half of the Bicentennial year enjoyed a number of other new accommodations. At the Constitution Avenue entrance to the Museum, a spacious lounge area with comfortable sofas and soft rugs opened for foot-weary visitors. Those eager to see the exhibits had a new escalator to take them directly from the ground-floor Bicentennial exhibit hall up to the second-floor rotunda area. There they obtained orientation maps keyed to large colored banners hanging at the entrances of exhibit halls around the rotunda. The banners identify the contents of the halls and add a note of gaiety and warmth to the rotunda’s grey granite facade. These improvements are part of a new program designed to insure that visitors find their way through the Museum without becoming lost or confused. New direc-

tional signs and map stands have been placed at strategic points to
assist in this effort. A rooftop greenhouse, serving as a research resource for the
Museum’s botanists, and a two-story Osteo-Preparation Laboratory have been erected in the east courtyard. The Osteo-Preparation Laboratory provides space for the dissection and preparation of bird and mammal research specimens, especially marine mammals, which the Museum is gathering in large numbers from its marine mammal beach salvage program. Another service to scientists set up at the Museum in 1975-1976 is the Scientific Event Alert Network (sEAN). SEAN is a worldwide communications system, administered by the Museum’s Director and a scientific review board, which alerts scientists throughout the world of geophysical, biological, astronomical, and anthropological events, from meteorite falls and volcanic eruptions to whale strandings and archeological finds.
One of the highlights of 1975-1976 at the Museum was the visit of Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The Emperor, who is a marine biologist, visited the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, where he spent over an hour in the privacy of a laboratory studying hydroid and mollusk specimens with the assistance of staff curators Dr. Frederick M. Bayer and Dr. Joseph Rosewater.
What kinds of animals and plants can one find on an undisturbed Caribbean coral reef? How do they interact with each other? What effects do changes in light, temperature, and wave action have on these organisms? How do populations change with time and increasing influence of man? What is the reef’s energy budget, and how much organic matter (carbon) and how many nutrients does it exchange with the surrounding sea?
At Carrie-Bow Cay, a tiny island that stands on the barrier reef extending along the coast of Belize (British Honduras), NMNH marine biologists, geologists, botanists, and paleontologists have undertaken a long-term ecological investigation that they hope will shed increased light on these questions.
The Investigation of Marine Shallow Water Ecosystems project (IMsWE) is coordinated by nmnn’s Dr. Klaus Ruetzler. He and the other scientists chose Carrie-Bow Cay as their study site because of

features that make it an ideal reef laboratory. Perhaps the most important of these features is the compactness of the reef, which slopes off sharply into deep water, making it convenient for the scientists to monitor its different habitat zones. Two other ideal characteristics are its accessibility from the mainland by charter boat and the presence of several buildings that can be used by the scientists as lodgings and laboratory space. Finally, and no less
importantly, the reef is not marred by pollution or other manmade disturbances.
In addition to carefully mapping and photographing the reef, much of the early study has been devoted to an inventory and description of the reef’s inhabitants. Samples of life have been systematically sampled from the various marine habitats off Carrie-Bow Cay and logged and distributed to specialists for identification. Quite a few of the scientists participating in the program have made frequent scuba-diving descents into the reef and lagoon waters to do their own collecting, which they prefer because they can make underwater observations that give them clues as to how the organisms they are interested in relate to the total reef ecosystem. Among this group are Dr. Ruetzler, who has inventoried the reef’s sponges; Dr. Thomas Waller, who is interested in Carrie-

Bow Cay’s bivalves, particularly the scallops; Dr. Porter Kier, who has collected over twenty different kinds of echinoids in the island’s lagoon and reef bottom; Dr. Ian Macintyre, who is studying the reef’s coral rocks; and Dr. James Norris, who is investigating Carrie-Bow Cay’s marine flora. Kjell Sandved, the Museum’s biological motion picture producer, documented all of this underwater work.
Many of the specimen collections made at Carrie-Bow Cay are now the basis for further studies. Dr. Ruetzler, for example, has been making electron microscope examinations of the blue-green algae within the cellular system of sponges, a study that illuminates the symbiotic process whereby an animal gets nutritious photosynthetic products from plants. Dr. Norris is submitting his specimens of algae and seaweed to colleagues for chemical analysis in order to discover what alkaloid compounds these plants contain that protect them from fish and other plant grazers.
Considerable research has been directed at the processes that contribute to the construction and destruction of the reef frame-

work—research that is giving scientists a better idea of how much energy the Carrie-Bow Cay reef ecosystem expends in carbonate production and breakdown. Dr. Ian Macintyre has headed this part of the project. One of his successful experiments provides a new means of determining the rates of growth of reef corals. At regular intervals, plastic bags are placed over coral head and a red dye released inside, staining the exposed coral. Eventually the coral is collected, sectioned, and radiographed. The result is a picture that perfectly preserves the history of the coral, making visible dye bands that can be read like tree rings and enabling Dr. Macintyre to see how a species of coral grows in relationship to its environment. Transplantation experiments of dyed corals suggest that at Carrie-Bow Cay light is the critical factor in determining coral form and growth. A coral can grow in a vertical column at depths where there is little light (below 50 feet), whereas in shallow areas where there is high light intensity the same species will show little vertical growth but significant hemispherical growth.
Other experiments by Dr. Macintyre are planned or are in progress. He and his colleague Dr. Walter Adey have drilled into the Carrie-Bow Cay reef substructure in initial attempts to reconstruct the historic development of the ecosystem. In another ongoing project, different types of coral plates, one-half to one-inch thick, have been spiked into the reef floor at different depths. Over a period of years these plates are expected to yield information on what types of boring organisms attack different corals and at what rate. Screened traps on upright plastic pipes record sediment accumulation rates and biological data. In several cases a rare mollusk invaded a trap in its larval, free-swimming stage and established itself in the sediment, allowing Dr. Thomas Waller to make observations of its growth.
Dr. Mary Rice is engaged in an intensive study of sipunculan worms that form burrows in dead reef coral and weaken its structure. Her investigation seeks to determine what are the diversity and density of worms in the rock; if there are some types of rock into which they bore more readily than others; and how they do the boring, a process that is poorly understood because the worms do not make the holes when they are put under observation in a laboratory.

DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY Archeology
In 1972, Robert B. Jones was bulldozing irrigation ditches in a field on his ranch near Wray, Colorado, when he turned up a quantity of bones and stone points. Jones called in Jack Miller, a Colorado anthropologist, who examined the site and identified several hundred bison bones and a large number of PaleoIndian stone and bone tools. This discovery set in motion a chain of events that led to a full-scale National Geographic Society-funded excavation directed by the National Museum of Natural History’s Dr. Dennis Stanford, an archeologist who heads a program that is trying to throw light on the settlement patterns of early man as he moved from the Bering Straits to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America.
The Stanford party’s dig at the Jones-Miller site revealed the bone remains of nearly 300 big-horned bison (the extinct Bison Antiquus), spread over a 30-meter-long by 20-meter-wide area. The bison evidently had been killed and butchered some 10,000 years ago by a band of 40 to 50 PaleoIndians. The bones had been tossed systematically into piles, suggesting that the bison were quartered and that groups of persons were organized and given specialized responsibilities for preparing meat cuts from different sections of the dead animals. Hundreds of stone and bone cutting and chopping tools were found at the site, as well as stone projectile points. The source of the stone has been traced to Plains areas in Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and the Texas panhandle, raising the question whether the stone came there through the union of several bands at the site, through one band’s roving travels, or through regional trade.
Whatever its source, the evidence shows that one or more groups of PaleoIndians evidently spent the winter in this area of northeastern Colorado and, on several occasions when they needed meat, banded together to corral and kill bison at the Jones-Miller draw.

(Photo credit: National Geographic Society)
In the scenario Dr. Stanford has reconstructed, the draw was filled with windblown snow. The hunters herded a group of bison into the draw’s snowdrifts and as the bison floundered around, dispatched them from the edge of the draw with hand-launched spears. Then the bison were butchered on the site, with the snow acting as a freezing agent to keep the meat fresh until the job was completed.
Many observers of the nineteenth-century Northern Plains Indians reported the use of a similar winter buffalo-hunting strategy and also noted that these hunts were highly ritualized occasions. In the center of the impoundment, a “medicine post” was set up and offerings were placed around it for a successful kill. Outside the impoundment, the hunt chief held a religious ceremony for several days before the hunt, burning incense on smudge fires.
At the Jones-Miller site Dr. Stanford uncovered intriguing evidence that these same rituals were practiced by the Plains Paleo-

Indians. A large post mold was found in the center of the draw. So shallowly was the post emplaced that it probably was not meant to serve any purpose in the butchering operation. Near the post mold a flutelike drilled bone and an extremely tiny but complete projectile point were dug up, both of which could have had a ceremonial purpose. West of the bone bed, a hearth area was found that contained red and yellow ochre, both associated with ceremonial activities.
The many similarities of the Jones-Miller hunt to the historical plains hunts have interesting implications. They suggest the existence of at least 10,000 years of socioreligious continuity on the northern plains, which would alter our theoretical concepts of the development of Plains Indian culture and the complexity of PaleoIndian society. According to Dr. Stanford: “It is the first PaleoIndian physical evidence we have ever uncovered that gives evidence of a high level of social organization. Early bison kills like this were generally assumed to be fortuitous happenings, but we can see from what happened at the Jones-Miller site that it was actually a highly complex, ritualized and planned event.”
Ethnology
Dr. Samuel Johnson labored for six years over his famous dictionary and now Dr. Robert Laughlin, a cultural anthropologist at the National Museum of Natural History, after an even longer lexicographic effort, has had his The Great Tzotzil Dictionary of San Lorenzo Zinacantan published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.
When he started the project fourteen years ago, Dr. Laughlin recalls that he was rashly confident he could swiftly complete it. He quotes in his dictionary’s introduction a letter he wrote to his secretary in those sanguine days:
“An extensive dictionary of the Mayan language, Tzotzil, spoken today by 78,000 Indians of the State of Chiapas—has not been compiled since the 18th century. In 1960 a vocabulary of 2,000 items of the dialet of Zinacantan was collected by Lore M. Colby. I have expanded the vocabulary to 4,000 items. It is hoped that this material will be ready for publication in a year’s time.”
He was wrong. The book was not ready for press until 1973 and in that interval, Dr. Laughlin noted ruefully, the population of the 78,000 Tzotzil Indians had grown with “fearful exuberance” to
108 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 119>>>

125,000; the vocabulary of 4,000 items had mushroomed to more than 45,000; and he had undergone searing tribulations in the process of having the dictionary programmed into a computer. He believes it to be the largest dictionary ever published of a Western Hemisphere language.
Dr. Laughlin began his study of the Zinacantec language in 1959. That year, he was invited as a Harvard postgraduate student to join Dr. Evon Vogt’s Chiapas Project. He soon succeeded in learning the language and set about documenting Zinacantec folktales and myths. Completing a dissertation on this subject, and taking a job at the Smithsonian, he returned to Zinacantan, and after a year decided to undertake the task of compiling an extensive dictionary for the Chiapas project’s use.
Most of the raw data for the dictionary was compiled between 1963-1967 with the help of two highly intelligent and articulate young Tzotzil collaborators, Romin Teratol and Anselmo Peres. Dr. Laughlin spent many months interviewing them in Zinacantan. He also brought them to the United States—to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and to his home in Alexandria, Virginia—where Tzotzil definitions were added for “such foreign elements as chaise lounges, which were promptly dubbed in Tzotzil ‘foot watchers.’ ” Identification of stars was made in visits to the Hayden Planetarium, and insects and larger animals not seen in Zinacantan were named during trips to United States museums and zoos.
Dr. Laughlin’s collaborators become increasingly foot-weary as month after month was spent walking along trails through the mountainous Zinacantan region. The dictionary has five maps, showing the 1,000 place names that the collaborators pinpointed with the aid of aerial photographs and ground surveys. Ornithologist Alexander Skutch went into the field and helped make sight identifications of scores of birds, and Dennis Breedlove, an authority on Chiapas flora, advised in the collection of more than 3,000 local plants. This part of the project was so successful that Dr. Laughlin began to worry that plants were going to engulf the whole dictionary.
As published, the dictionary is 598 pages long. The heaviness of the tome makes a mockery of the conventional wisdom that “primitives speak ‘primitive’ languages,” Dr. Laughlin believes. For him the language has genius. Its musical cadences and complex phraseol-

ogy brilliantly lend themselves to the formal discourse, gossip, and spinning of tales that are the heart of Zinacantan life.
Squash, gourds, and pumpkins (Curcurbita plants) are native to the Western Hemisphere, where they evolved in close association with bees that are especially adapted to pollinate them. But when these plants were introduced into other parts of the world, squash bees were left behind, so that less effective honeybees, native wild bees, or man himself, had to do the pollinating. These methods of pollination have never worked very well, and crops of Curcurbita plants cultivated in areas without squash bees have a poor yield.
NMNH entomologist Dr. Paul Hurd is attempting to restore this perfect and age-old squash-plant-and-insect partnership in Hawaii, an island where squashes exist but no squash bees. If Dr. Hurd’s experiment is successful, he feels that it may possibly be repeated throughout the world, dramatically increasing the production of one of man’s important food sources.
One of the first things Dr. Hurd and his two collaborators, Dr. E. Gorton Linsley and A. E. Michelbacher, had to determine was which species of squash bee would be best to export to Hawaii. After studying the distribution, ecology, and behavior of the twenty-one species of squash bees ranging throughout Mexico and North America, they selected the species P. pruinosa because of its efficiency as a pollinator of almost all domestic Curcurbita plants and its proven ability to survive in a wide variety of climatic and topographical conditions.
They chose California’s Sacramento Valley as a region to collect bees for their experiment. Deep rich soil makes the Sacramento Valley a center for the growing of pumpkins for the canning industry; a great deal of commercial and home planting of summer and fall squashes is done there, too. This abundance of pumpkins is directly related to the large populations of P. pruinosa bees that live in the area.
One of the flat, grassy, well-watered areas where the squash bees make their burrows was located, and behavioral observations were made that determined that the bees were leaving their nests for the fields shortly after 5 a.m. It was apparent that they had become adapted to flying at early morning temperatures and at low light-

<<<Page: 121>>>

intensities so that they could synchronize their foraging with the limited time in the morning that the pumpkin flowers are open.
Before the heat of the day wilts and closes the flowers and other insects arrive, the P. pruinosa bees are able to get the pollen and nectar they need from the flower and at the same time pollinate them. The plants have adaptive features that encourage pollination, including heavy, large, and adhesive pollen grains; an adhesive stigma; a large amount of sugar-rich nectar produced by both staminate and pistillate flowers; and large showy blossoms.
Once the scientists discovered the daily rhythm of activity of the squash bees, they were able to choose the best time to collect the bees for their introduction experiments. Females, they decided, are best moved immediately after their emergence from the pupate stage in early June, before nest construction has begun.
They checked on this and other critical factors by conducting a number of trial introductions. Batches of Sacramento bees were collected in the fields and released the next day, 250 miles away, near squash plantings close to the Davis and Berkeley campuses of the University of California.
A method of transporting the bees had to be developed for the trial introductions. Still in the flowers, the bees were placed in plastic bags that were put in thermos jugs or ice chests with a cardboard liner to protect them from direct contact with the ice or ice water. Usually some bees died during the trips, but most of them were ready to resume full activity on being released. Before letting them go, the three scientists marked the bees with colored acrylic paint so that later they could identify them on the plants.
Feeling that the trial introductions had worked out well enough to warrant going ahead with the Hawaii experiment, the three scientists enlisted the cooperation of the Hawaii and the California Agricultural Experiment Stations, and Dr. Toshiyuki Nishida and his associates of the Department of Entomology of the University of Hawaii. Dr. Nishida made local arrangements, including the locating of pumpkin plantings where the bees could be released.
Dr. Hurd and Mr. Michelbacher then flew a batch of captive bees to Hawaii and released them at designated sites in Hawaii and on the neighboring island of Oahu. These sites are now being monitored to see if breeding populations of squash bees will succeed in permanently establishing themselves.

Dr. Kurt Fredriksson is completing a decade of studies of the only major meteorite crater on earth that is directly comparable to lunar impact craters.
Lonar crater, in the Bulana District of Maharashtra, India, is a rimmed circular depression in basaltic rock, 1,830 meters across and nearly 150 meters deep, with a shallow lake in the center. For many years it was commonly believed to be volcanic, despite the glass fragments that had been found on the rim of the crater— evidence of a meteoritic origin—and despite the crater’s close resemblance in structure and size to Arizona’s Meteor Crater.
In 1964, the Geological Survey of India carried out magnetic, gravity, and seismic surveys at the site, but the surveyors did not uncover sufficient evidence to prove the impact hypothesis. No magnetic anomalies of significance were discovered, and studies of lake water and soils and plants from in and around the crater did not reveal any appreciable concentration of nickel or cobalt, two elements that are present in enriched quantities in most meteorites.
Unsatisfied with the scope of this investigation, Dr. Fredriksson, an authority on meteorites, suggested further tests. He knew that if Lonar was indeed a meteoritic crater, its situation in basaltic rock, which is similar to many lunar basalts, would give it singular significance. No other basaltic impact craters are known on earth, and samples of the Lonar crater would be of great value for comparison with samples brought back from the moon by the Apollo missions.
The India Geological Survey concurred with Dr. Fredriksson about the importance of establishing the impact origin of the Lonar structure. In cooperation with the Smithsonian, the Survey began a comprehensive exploration program, including geologic mapping, drilling, trenching, and geochemical studies. The work began in 1970 and although not yet completely finished, it has established beyond a doubt that the Lonar crater was produced by a meteorite that hit the earth’s surface perhaps less than 50,000 years ago (carbon-14 dating indicates an age of more than 30,000 years).
“At Lonar we can make a detailed study of debris ejected from a relatively recent basaltic impact point, including a mapping of its fall-out distribution,” Dr. Fredriksson said. “This is valuable because it is not feasible to do this with moon craters. On the moon’s

View of Lonar crater at Bulana, Maharashtra, India, where a meteorite exploded. Dr. Kurt Fredriksson of the Museum staff is completing a decade of studies of this crater, which is the only major meteorite crater on earth that is directly comparable to lunar impact craters.
surface we are left with a record of a period of intense meteoritic activity that took place during the formation of the solar system 4 to 4.5 billion years ago. During this time when one crater was formed, additional meteorites would hit directly on top of it, mixing and agglomerating the debris, and in doing so creating a very complex and confusing history. This continuing bombardment, which now takes place at a much lower rate, formed the moon’s characteristic breccia rocks (breccia rock consists of mixed fragments embedded in a fine-grained matrix).
“Indeed, for hundreds of millions of years such impacts may have been the dominant geological process on the earth, moon, and other bodies of the solar system. In order to appreciate the magnitude of the forces involved, consider the fact that a kilometer-sized meteoritic body traveling at 20 kilometers per second packs an energy perhaps 10 times greater than the energy released in the explosion of volcanoes during each year on earth.”
In the India Geological Survey’s investigation, fifty-five trenches one to three meters in depth were excavated in the main crater rim flank, reaching out in concentric patterns as far as twice the distance of the crater radii. No volcanic ejecta was found, but in six trenches, spherules and fragments of black glassy material were found that are characteristic of intensely shocked basalt.
To explore the main crater, six holes more than 300 meters deep were bored into the lake bottom. The cores that were brought up had 100 meters of lake sediment that contained small amounts of impact glass and shocked rock fragments. Below the sediment

<<<Page: 124>>>

strata, the drilling returned cores of coarse breccia, either unshocked or slightly shocked. Beneath this layer of coarse breccia, all drilling encountered a layer composed of unconsolidated to extremely friable microbreccia.
Dr. Fredriksson and his colleagues from the Department of Mineral Sciences, Joseph A. Nelen and Dr. Robert F. Fudali, and Dr. Daniel Milton of the United States Geological Survey, working in collaboration with Ananda Dube of the Division of Petrology of the India Geological Survey, analyzed the constitution of Lonar basalts, breccias, and glass ejecta, with an electron microprobe and compared them with stony meteorites and lunar materials. This work was supported mainly by the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program and the Smithsonian Research Foundation.
The analysis showed close structural and textural similarities among meteorites, Lonar, and lunar material. These data, combined with the mapping of the crater stratigraphy and impact fall-out, are expected to aid in the interpretation of questions about the source and depth at which lunar ejecta originated; how unfirm and how extensive this ejecta blanket is, and what role secondary cratering plays in the shaping of the moon’s surface.
Dr. Beryl B. Simpson is completing work on an International Biological Program (1Br) comparative ecosystem study examining the generally held theory that similar communities can evolve in two widely separated areas with comparable rainfall, temperature, soil, and other conditions.
One theory holds that a high level of evolutionary convergence of form and process occurs in similar environments, and IBP supported several programs that tried to produce ecosystem models on this assumption. But Dr. Simpson and her collaborators decided to test the theory of community convergence before accepting it as a basis for construction of models that would influence important policies of land use, management, and conservation.
Because a comparison of complex ecosystems would be an overwhelming task, they chose to study two relatively simple pairs of desert scrub ecosystems with very similar climates and geological histories. One of these comparisons was between the Sonoran Desert near Tucson, Arizona, and the Monte Desert, near Andalaga,

Argentina. At these sites, Dr. Simpson investigated the similarity of plant-pollinator relationships and the breeding systems of the dominant perennial plants.
The thirteen dominant plant species were singled out in each of the desert areas (dominance was based on numbers and ground coverage). Dr. Simpson then set out to determine how the pollinators interact with the plants; how much energy these plants apportion to nectar and flower production in order to attract pollinators; and how many pollinators are supported by the plant community. To this end she collected data on floral structure and odor, blooming schedules, amounts of flower and nectar production, sugar concentrations of the nectar, amounts of pollen produced, and daily cycles of both nectar and pollen presentation.
The determination of which insects visited the flowers was made in the study of a collaborating entomologist. Solitary bees are by far the most important desert scrub pollinator. Several hundred species were collected during the project, with more at the North American site turning out to be specialized than at the South American site.
Dr. Simpson observed that plants in North and South America depend on different major pollen carriers, invest different amounts of energy in flower production, and supply different amounts of nectar and pollen to potential animal pollinators.
An interesting difference between the two ecosystems is their blooming patterns. This difference appears to be the result of the way in which rainfall is dispersed during the year. The total amount of rain received at both sites appears to be about the same, but at the Monte Desert site rain falls only in the summer, whereas at the Sonoran Desert site rain falls at the end of the summer and toward the end of the winter. As a consequence, in Argentina the dominant plants bloom patchily for a long period during the summer, as opposed to Arizona, where the blooming is relatively synchronous during short blooming times in the spring and late summer.
Mollusks migrated into the Atlantic and Caribbean at the time these basins opened through seafloor spreading 150 million years ago. The evolutionary history of these animals over the next 90 million years is the focus of a study by Dr. Erle G. Kauffman.
116 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 127>>>

Analyzing thousands of specimens collected in widely scattered field areas and housed in the nmnun’s collections, he has been able to document the evolutionary response or patterns of these ecologically sensitive organisms to major fluctuations in the global environment.
By integrating his data with radiometric age determinations from volcanic ash falls preserved in sediments of these ocean basins, Dr. Kauffman can also measure variations on rates of evolutionary change. As expected, patterns and rates of evolution were found to vary widely between different types of organisms. Predictable variances also showed up in single evolving lineages subjected to major changes in the Earth’s environment.
But many unexpected evolutionary phenomena also emerged from these studies: nearly simultaneous, basically catastrophic extinctions among diverse groups of organisms; periods of very rapid radiation of new forms; and remarkably fast evolutionary rates, at times producing a new species every 80,000 years within a single lineage. Dr. Kauffman believes these evolutionary changes are related to geologically cataclysmic events brought about by plate tectonics, seafloor spreading, and continental drift, and he suggests that this relationship clearly alters the concepts of evolution.
According to Dr. Kauffman: “Strict Darwinism holds that evolution takes place slowly, through small changes over long periods of time, on a globe that was structurally and environmentally stable through time. It gives no mechanism for explaining periods of rapid evolution and massive extinction. But now we work with a different model of the Earth’s crust and are beginning to realize that plate tectonic movements provide logical mechanisms for biological ‘explosions’ and ‘catastrophes’ that we see reflected in the history of fossil organisms.
“The movement of crustal plates across the Earth’s surface and the resultant building and/or collapse of oceanic ridges and uplifts over the 90-million-year period I am studying, caused major fluctuations in the sea level and accompanying climatic changes which were the principal controlling environmental forces on the rates and patterns of evolution in marine mollusks.”
Essentially, the history Dr. Kauffman has documented follows this pattern: global rise of sea level took place during times of rapid plate movements and oceanic ridge building, flooding much of the low continental areas of the world with shallow continental seas

and creating vast new spaces and environments that were ideal for the habitation, spread, and diversification of marine organisms. For mollusks, evolution proceeded at a relatively slow but increasing rate during these periods; life conditions were optimal and environmental stresses were low. Dr. Kauffman has found evolutionary rates during these times that averaged only one new species every half million years within many lineages.
The slowing and temporary cessation of plate movements resulted in ultimate collapse of oceanic uplifts and ridges like the present mid-Atlantic Ridge, caused global lowering of sea level, environmental decline, restriction of space and resources, and ultimate elimination of many prime marine environments for mollusks. As a result, strong competition for food and space coupled with high environmental stress caused extinction of many mollusks and acceleration of evolutionary rates of others.
The maximum evolutionary rates recorded within molluscan lineages during these high-stress periods were approximately one species per 80,000 years—the most rapid rate ever documented for marine organisms. The more abrupt the plate tectonic event and resultant environmental events, the more dramatic the evolutionary rates and extinctions associated with them. Superimposed upon these patterns is a complex ecological response. Specialized and normally exposed (swimming, surface-dwelling) marine organisms show the earliest and/or most rapid evolutionary response to en-

vironmental stress; generalized or protected (buried) marine organisms, as well as those of brackish-to-fresh water and the intertidal zone, show the lowest level of evolutionary response.
Ornithological research at the National Museum of Natural History during 1975-1976 included publication of Birds of the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic (American Geophysical Union), by Dr. George Watson, the first comprehensive field identification guide to penguins, petrels, and other resident and vagrant birds of these areas. It is illustrated with color plates and black-and-white drawings by Bob Hines of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Sixty-seven birds are described in detail, with information on reproduction, molting, flight, habits, voice, display, food, predation, ectoparasites, habitat, and distribution. Numerous vagrants are covered in less detail. There is also an introduction to the Antarctic environment and directions on how to observe seabirds. The book is the culmination of a project that began in 1963 when the National Science Foundation approached the Smithsonian Institution about the possibility of producing such a guide. Dr. Watson made three collection trips into the Subantarctic and Antarctic areas, surveyed all of the literature (dating back to Captain Cook) on the birds of the area, and examined specimens in major museum collections, including those at the Smithsonian gathered by the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842 and Admiral Richard Byrd’s United States Antarctic Service Expeditions of the 1930s and 1940s. One of the author’s aims is to standardize the nomenclature for birds of that region, as well as suggest areas where further research is needed. He believes that his book would also benefit tourists who are now regularly traveling to Antarctica and previously had no really helpful guide to the birds of that area.
Dr. Richard Zusi continued his studies of the evolution of bark climbing in the tropical family Dendrocolaptidae. Members of this family, such as the Buff-throated Woodcreeper (not related to woodpeckers), feed along trunks and limbs, lifting mosses, poking into holes, and digging into cracks of the bark with their beaks. They support themselves with feet that are adapted for clinging and a spine-tipped tail that bends under their weight.
Dr. Paul Slud has been working in Central America, as well as

in other New World Tropic areas, on a project that correlates ecological background with bird census observations. His analysis of this information, published as Geographic and Climatic Relationships of Avifaunas with Special Reference to Comparative Distribution in the Neotropics (Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, No. 212) establishes links between the comparative distribution of birds and prevailing environmental and climatic conditions.
Dr. Storrs Olson edited the Collected Papers in Avian Paleontology Honoring the 90th Birthday of Alexander Wetmore, eighteen papers by prominent avian paleontologists. Dr. Wetmore’s career at the Smithsonian spans more than half a century. Dr. Olson also made trips to Ilha da Trinidade (off the coast of Brazil), Hawaii, and Japan, collecting many specimens of fossil and recent birds for his studies of island paleofaunas and evolution of seabirds.

National Zoological Park
Out of the construction chaos of the past years, the National Zoological Park’s Master Plan now begins to be seen in reality. The “William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger Exhibit’’ was completed and officially dedicated on May 25, 1976; the outdoor waterfowl ponds and the crane yards around the Bird House Plaza opened in July; and the enlargement of the Elephant House yards for the African and Indian elephants, Indian rhinoceroses, and Nile hippopotamuses were finished in the late fall of 1975.
Renovation started on the interiors of the Elephant House and Bird House. Construction began on new bear dens, and on the massive job of digging out the hillside along Rock Creek for the General Services Building.
Research and scientific projects grew steadily, and the amount of grant money the Zoo received likewise increased. Grants to Zoo personnel came from the National Institutes of Health, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Preservation Trust International (formerly sare International), the Noble Foundation, and the National Geographic Society, as well as from the Smithsonian’s Research Foundation and Fluid Research Fund. These grants supported such diverse projects as the evaluation of anesthesia and restraint of exotic species by monitoring blood gases and blood pH, and the study of social communication in three South American canids.
The Zoo began work-study programs with the Washington Technical Institute, the University of Maryland, and Cornell University. These programs enable students to become familiar with zoo work and to plan appropriate study for zoo careers. Participating offices include Animal Management, Animal Health, Zoological Research, Graphics and Exhibits, and Police and Safety.
Predoctoral and postdoctoral training has expanded also. The veterinary internship program, which began in 1974, fulfills our national purpose by helping other zoos improve their veterinary staffs. The predoctoral programs in the Offices of Animal Health and Zoological Research are yielding productive results.
The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) expanded their operations this past year by taking charge of the food concessions; money from these concessions goes into Zoo educational programs, such as the

puppet shows designed and produced by the Bob Brown Marionettes which were performed during July and August 1976. A character named Zoodle, the star of each show, cautioned his audience against littering as well as against feeding and harassing the animals.
The Zoo’s new glockenspiel is the imaginative gift of the late Dr. Ivy A. Pelzman of Washington, D.C. Its thirty-six bells, in three octaves, were cast in The Netherlands, and the tunes may be played either manually or electronically. Just below the clock a fiberglass lion, bear, elephant, and giraffe move when the hour strikes.
Major changes are going on in the hardy hoofstock area. Several years ago Zoo staff determined this area was being destroyed by the large hoofed mammals. At first some of the cages were decorated with plants to conceal erosion, buildings, and fences. This, however, was not successful with animals as large as the greater kudus and Cape buffaloes which trampled pens and hillsides. Thus, during the past year, the kudus and Cape buffaloes were shipped out to other zoos; in their cages now are dama gazelles and blesboks. In adjoining cages are red brockets from Mexico and muntjacs from the Far East showing New World and Old World cervids side by side. As the smaller species allow the plants to take hold in these enclosures, there has been a dramatic change: the animals together with the greenery have become the focus of the exhibit. Guy Greenwell moved to Front Royal to develop the bird incubation program for the Zoo. Emphasis is on birds which have previously bred well at the Zoo, including roulrouls, Bali mynahs, vulturine guineafowl, and Hawaiian geese. Eggs laid at the Zoo will be sent to Front Royal where they will be hatched and the young raised and returned or placed in other zoos. The unit’s incubation program was so successful in breeding Hawaiian geese in 1975 (it raised nineteen) that the International Wild Waterfowl Association presented the Zoo with its Annual Achievement Award. There appears to be a bumper crop of this endangered bird in 1976 also. The new “William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger Exhibit’ contains a large conference room and offices for the curatorial staff, a

small theater for the public, and indoor and outdoor exhibit areas for the big cats. The keeper staff has had to learn to operate the new mechanical systems, such as the electronic shift doors and complex alarm system. Mohini, the eighteen-year-old white tigress, returned from Chicago, along with her three white “grand” cubs from Cincinnati. The Atlas lions arrived from Morocco in September 1976, as part of a long-term breeding project.
One of this year’s major accomplishments and the culmination of a three-year project was the birth of an orangutan. This baby, the offspring of two animals born in captivity and raised by their own mothers, was the first second-generation captive birth of an orangutan in the Western Hemisphere, and possibly only the second in the world. Although the female proved to be a good mother, the baby died later of a bacterial meningitis. It is possible, however, that the orangutan captive-breeding program will not end when all the animals caught in the wild die—at least not at the National Zoo.
The primary function of the Office of Animal Health is to provide the best available health care for the animal collection, whether at Rock Creek Park or at Front Royal, Virginia. The delivery of veterinary care to the Conservation and Research Center is more difficult than in the Park due to the inability to watch closely and handle the herd animals in their large enclosures.
In both locations, however, the ideal approach in exotic medicine is preventive. Yearly tuberculosis tests and physical examinations are conducted on all primates, and yearly vaccinations and physical examinations are undergone by the carnivores, including the cats, pandas, and canids. The quarantine facility of the hospital prevents the introduction of any infectious agent into the existing collection. All animals are monitored by routine fecal examinations and appropriate therapy is administered when parasites are found.
The Office of Pathology’s primary functions are diagnostic medicine, teaching, and research. The diagnostic aspect is its paramount mission. Routine blood tests, urinalysis, cultures, parasite examinations, and a variety of other diagnostic tests are performed in the
124 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 135>>>

Office’s laboratories. All animals that die undergo autopsies and are completely examined grossly and histopathologically to gain insight into the various causes of death.
In the spring of 1976 an outbreak of versiniosis, a bacterial disease caused by Versinia pseudotuberculosis, took the lives of three of the Zoo’s blesboks. Through the diagnostic capabilities of the Zoo laboratories, the cause of the disease in the hoofstock was isolated. A vaccine was developed from the isolated bacterial organisms, and an all-out effort was made to exterminate the carrier vermin, which had brought the disease into the yards.
The Office began a new system of record keeping by streamlining the flow of information concerned with pathologic diagnoses. An 1BM data-retrieval system is used; it can integrate previous material generated in this Office. A similar retrieval system is used for the color-slide collection, which currently contains over 3,000 slides of pathologic and clinical conditions of zoo animals.
During the past fifteen months, the Office of Zoological Research not only continued previous programs and studies but added some new ones.
The Venezuelan field project in vertebrate behavior and ecology, coordinated by Dr. John Eisenberg, assembled valuable data concerning distribution, abundance, reproduction, and natural history of selected species of marsupials, rodents, primates, reptiles, and birds. The studies were conducted by Dr. Eisenberg, National Zoo staff, and students in two quite different regions: the montane rainforest of Guatopo National Park and the seasonally inundated llanos on the ranch of Sr. Tomas Blohm.
In June 1976, Dr. Eugene Morton began to reintroduce on Barro Colorado Island several avian species which had become locally extinct. Seven song wrens and seven white-breasted wood wrens, trapped on the mainland, were transported to Barro Colorado, marked with bands, and released. Preliminary indications suggest that some of the reintroduced birds have established themselves on the island. The problem of local extinction in a biological preserve the size of Barro Colorado is of great theoretical interest since populations in small areas may be of extremely small size, and un-

<<<Page: 136>>>

predictable environmental events, over which man has no control, may cause local extinction.
The studies of South American canid social behavior and communication, conducted by Dr. Devra Kleiman at the Conservation and Research Center, were highlighted by the birth of two litters of crab-eating foxes. Both were reared by the mothers, and detailed observations of development were recorded for the second litter. At the same time, a maned wolf was born which did not survive. The female bush dog was artificially inseminated but the attempt failed, and a proven breeding male was sent on breeding loan from Los Angeles.
The Zoo was saddened in October 1975, by the untimely death of Dr. Helmut Buechner. His energy and enthusiasm successfully launched several projects dealing with the propagation of ungulates at the Zoo. He will be sorely missed.
FRONT ROYAL, VIRGINIA In the past fifteen months since the Smithsonian was given full title to the Front Royal, Virginia, property, the Conservation and Research Center as a resource for research has grown. Dr. Eugene Morton of the Office of Zoological Research began two projects: the first concerns the nesting habits and population dynamics of the eastern bluebird; the second studies the movements and social organization of the turkey vulture using radiotelemetry. Dr. Dale Madison of McGill University in Montreal carried out a summer investigation in 1975 of the social use of space by two species of mice, the meadow mouse and the white-footed mouse. Dr. Christen Wemmer and Larry Collins began a three-year study of the social structure and behavior of the Pére David’s deer; and in the summer of 1976 Kerry Malson initiated a one-year study of nutrition and pasture-carrying capacity, also on the Pére David’s deer.
During the winter and spring, a muntjac facility was completed. It consists of seven paddocks covering about 5 acres, with a central observation tower. The yards have been planted in dogwood and the plant growth will be allowed to proceed naturally to provide adequate cover for the animals. The tower will allow keepers and researchers to observe the animals without disturbing them.
The granary built in 1916 is being renovated as a commissary.

One wing will be a rodent-breeding area, and the other will include walk-in cooler and freezer, meat saw and grinder, butcher table, food mixer, can washer, tables, and counter space. There will also be an office, locker rooms, and a drive-through section for loading trucks in cold weather.
The first residents of the Center in 1974 were one male and two female scimitar-horned oryx. Today the herd numbers nine, all of which were born in captivity, and eight either at the Rock Creek facility or the Conservation Center. There were two births this spring and one last December which was hand-reared. Other births this year include seven crab-eating foxes, two zebra, and two Pére David’s deer.
Cooperative agreements with other zoos have made the Center’s present large breeding groups possible. The Bactrian camel herd is jointly owned by the National Zoo and the Minnesota State Zoological Gardens, while the New York Zoological Society provided over one-third of the Pére David’s deer. The onager herd was established solely through the contributions of the zoos in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The Lincoln Park Zoo sent three male muntjacs to help establish breeding groups for this species of nonrelated animals.
The audience of the National Zoological Park is large and varied. According to a visitor survey completed in 1976, visitors to the National Zoo have above-average education levels and aboveaverage annual family incomes; they are predominantly white and non-Spanish-speaking, and visit the Zoo as a family experience; they also visit other zoos and natural history museums, and have a high interest in other cultural institutions. The Zoo seeks to provide a well-balanced offering of exhibits, programs, and materials for this audience.
Working as a team with the Office of Animal Management and the Office of Graphics and Exhibits, numerous interpretive projects were completed. Labels received first priority. Each label has two parts: a standard identification label containing basic species information, and a visual key which consists of a statement about an aspect of biology relating to the animal exhibit with a photo or drawing to highlight that statement. By spring 1976 all labels also

had been rewritten in a two-langauge format, English and Spanish.
More complex exhibits were completed for the three outdoor alcoves in the new “William M. Mann Memorial Lion-Tiger Exhibit.” A photo-collage and written text in each alcove deal with a single theme—habitat, predator-prey relationships, and social behavior. In addition, two films were produced for showing in the small theater in this exhibit. Tiger is a live-action profile of that endangered cat. The Big Cats and How They Came To Be is the history of cat evolution, and was animated by Film Polski, Warsaw, Poland, through a grant from the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program.
For the first time in many years, the Zoo will have a written guide: ZOOBOOK. This pictorial essay, written by this Office and photographed by Jan Skrentny, tells the story of the Zoo’s animals and of the people and programs that revolve around them. ZOOBOOK will be published in the late fall of 1976.
In addition to its ongoing dealings with the press, the information service added two innovations. Tiger Talk, the employees newsletter, was redesigned and is published weekly. A second development was the three-month trial photo-caption story, mailed to 150 selected newspapers. This was well received and plans are underway to continue this service in 1977.
The use of the Zoo’s library increased considerably in the past year, and a library technician was hired to provide more assistance to users. The generous gift of Dr. Helmut Buechner’s journal collection filled many gaps in journal holdings and over 200 volumes were bound. Also this past year a good portion of library funds was used to develop the book and journal collection at the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia.
With the Office of Education—Information, a new format for animal identification labels was designed to present information in the most effective manner. The labels are designed so they can be read easily at various distances, are legible at low light levels, are easily produced, and are flexible. The first labels in the Reptile House in 1974 revealed some problems and additional changes were made. Complete labeling of the Park, with the exception of the Bird House, was finished in September 1976.

A child studies the National Zoological Park’s brochure showing the various pictograms which will direct visitors to areas of interest.
The Zoo is attempting to provide an organized approach by which visitors may find their way around the grounds. Graphic totems, 12 to 18 feet high, using the new animal pictographs, will be located along the center road known as Olmsted Walk. These totems mark the beginning and end of six trails that pass the animal exhibits. Each trail covers a specific group of animals, such as birds or hoofstock, and is named for a conspicuous animal found on that trail, such as the crowned crane or zebra. The pictograph representing that animal will be in the largest space on the totem. The first totem was installed at the waterfowl ponds in early August 1976. The remaining ten will be in place by October. These six separate trails allow the visitor to cover the entire Zoo or just one area. The totems also include such information as the length of each walk and the approximate time needed to complete it.
During the past year the Office of Police and Safety has also undergone changes—keeping pace with the rest of the Zoo’s activities, while continuing its emphasis on service and public relations. In-service training for officers was expanded to include on-thejob training for less experienced recruits, and has resulted in an

increase in applications from minority groups. In addition, the summer work-study program with the Washington Technical Institute has turned out very well. Students in the law enforcementcriminal justice programs were hired as police aides and used in nonenforcement aspects of the police and safety program, such as internal traffic and pedestrian control, and communications and office work at the police station.
A major effort was made to prepare the Rock Creek Park facility for the Bicentennial summer, and a number of related projects were begun in addition to the ongoing Master Plan construction. They included renovating the roadway leading to the Monkey House and constructing a visitor sidewalk; building a visitor pavilion on the site of the old Puma House; and completely renovating the Mane Restaurant and the Panda Cafe.
Three major areas of construction under the Master Plan are the Education-Administration Building, the bear dens, and the General Services Building. In July 1975, construction began on the Education-Administration Building near the Connecticut Avenue entrance. When completed in December 1976, the building will include space for the library, the administrative staffs of the Zoo, and the Friends of the National Zoo, plus three classrooms and a 300-seat auditorium.
Construction started on bear exhibits in February 1976 involves two areas: one for polar bears, with three amphitheaters and underwater viewing, and the other for grizzley bears and a smaller bear, possibly the sun bear. Completion is scheduled for January 1977.
Work on the General Services Building began in January 1976. When the building opens in August 1977, all of the Zoo’s maintenance facilities will be moved into it, thereby freeing a number of areas around the Park for other uses. Included in this building will be additional parking spaces. This is the largest project under the Master Plan; the first phase is contracted at approximately six million dollars. The second phase, four parking levels providing spaces for 1,000 cars, is subject to future appropriation by Congress.
By the summer of 1976 all Bicentennial projects were complete, and the center of the Park was opened to the public.

The Office of Facilities Management is primarily responsible for the upkeep of all buildings, grounds, and related mechanical systems of the Zoo. The majority of the work consists of specific, recurring duties which make up the preventive maintenance programs. This year, however, additional responsibility came to the Office owing to progression of the Master Plan. New and renovated buildings now have multimechanical systems—sophisticated, expensive, sensitive —which must be incorporated into the preventive maintenance programs.
Office of International Programs
The Office of International Programs fosters and coordinates the international aspects of Smithsonian programs and also provides support to United States institutions of research and higher learning, including the Smithsonian, through Special Foreign Currency Program grants. Its functions are carried out by sections designated as the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program and the International Liaison Section.
The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards grants to support the basic research interests of American institutions, including the Smithsonian, in those countries where the United States holds blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. The Program is active in countries where the Treasury Department deems United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of normal federal requirements, including at present India, Pakistan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Poland. The Smithsonian has received a fiscal year 1977 appropriation of $3.5 million in “excess” currencies, which will be used to support projects in the anthropological sciences, systematic and environmental biology, astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum professional fields. The Smithsonian received a fiscal year 1976 appropriation of $500,000 in “excess” currencies that was used to grant support to over sixty projects in these disciplines.
Science / 131

<<<Page: 142>>>

Since its inception in fiscal year 1966, the srcp has awarded approximately $29 million in foreign currency grants to some eighty-seven institutions in thirty-two states and the District of Columbia. Within the framework of the Program, the Smithsonian will make a third contribution of $1 million in Egyptian pounds in support of Egypt’s efforts to save the submerged temples at Philae in Nubia.
The International Liaison Section (11s) provides liaison and assistance to individuals and units of the Smithsonian in dealing with the Department of State and with foreign governments. It handles international matters involving travel and research abroad, and foreign participation in domestic programs of the Smithsonian. 11s provides passport and visa services for Smithsonian staff, and assists in research arrangements for foreign visitors. 11s worked closely with the Division of Performing Arts in arranging Bicentennial-related participation by 814 foreign folk artists in the Festival of American Folklife, and some 150 other foreigners participating in the special Bicentennial activities of the Institution.
Radiation Biology Laboratory
The form and structure of growing plant cells are determined by the interaction of at least two qualitatively different sets of signals. One of these controlling sets of signals is within the cell, and the second is external, consisting of a wide range of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and availability of the raw materials needed for growth.
The internal instructions can be thought of as coming from a complex architectural blueprint, which is being followed by the molecular processes of the cell. This genetic blueprint, however, has a number of alternative, contingency plans that are read only if an appropriate signal is received from the environment. As the organism develops, it follows a basic pattern, so the species is clearly recognizable, but superimposed on this basic pattern are many possibie variations of development in space and time.
132 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 143>>>

One of the most important and dependable external signals is sunlight. The Radiation Biology Laboratory has been studying the growth and development of organisms for nearly fifty years. Currently, the Laboratory is emphasizing three basic areas of research: (1) the molecular nature of the pathways regulated and controlled by light, (2) the time dependency of developmental processes upon periodic changes in sunlight, and (3) a quantitative description of the time course of periodic fluctuations in environmental signals that are important for growth.
A familiar example of the control of development by light is the sprouting of a potato. In the dark, the shoot produced is white and the leaves are small. If the shoot is exposed to light, the leaves expand and develop structures within the cells, called chloroplasts, that contain the membrane and pigments, chlorophylls (green) and carotenoids (yellow), that are necessary for photosynthesis. The formation of these chloroplast photosynthetic membranes and the mechanism by which proteins are added to the membranes during growth are being studied by electron microscopy and biochemistry.
Experiments have not yet determined whether the information for controlling the synthesis of chloroplast membranes is within the chloroplast itself or is in the cytoplasm of the cell. The molecular components required for synthesizing proteins are known as polyribosomes. Polyribosomes occur on chloroplast membranes. These membrane-bound polyribosomes are attached to the membrane by proteins, since they can be released by mild treatment with the enzyme trypsin that breaks down protein. The released polyribosomes probably do not contain remnants of membrane, since they can be degraded by another enzyme, ribonuclease. The ribonuclease attacks the information-carrying nucleic acids in the polyribosomes. In contrast, treatment of membranes with the detergent “Nonidet” releases polyribosomes that appear to be attached to membrane remnants about the size of the polyribosome group. Another detergent, “Triton,” solubilizes much of the membrane, but leaves the polyribosomes attached to much larger pieces of membrane. These membrane remnants are identifiable both in the electron microscope and by analysis of their protein (polypeptide) composition. The remnants differ in polypeptide composition from the membrane as a whole. This observation suggests that the polyribosomes lie on specialized portions of the membrane.
Science / 133

<<<Page: 144>>>

Some chloroplast membrane proteins are synthesized in the chloroplast itself, and some are synthesized in the cytoplasm. These proteins are then independently inserted into the chloroplast membrane. Isolated chloroplast membranes can be made to synthesize protein in vitro and the products obtained compared with products formed in vivo. The results suggest that the in vitro system completes some membrane polypeptide chains. It is by studying such in vitro systems that the control of membrane synthesis by the interaction of information from both the chloroplast and cytoplasm may be understood.
The complexity of the chloroplast development in flowering plants has made progress slow and difficult. Another approach being pursued in the Laboratory is the use of algal cells. Many algae have developed special pigment molecules that act as light-harvesting antennae to funnel the light energy into photosynthetic membranes. These pigments have properties which allow efficient absorption of light in the color bands of sunlight that cannot be absorbed efficiently by chlorophyll alone. Thus, light captured between the red and blue absorbing peaks of green chlorophyll is transferred to chlorophyll in special protein-pigment structures (phycobilisomes) for photosynthesis. These phycobilisomes can be isolated from membranes and their structure determined. The pigment which finally funnels the light energy to chlorophyll is called allophycocyanin, and recent data show that it is in the base of the phycobilisome near the attachment point on the photosynthetic membrane. Allophycocyanin in vivo is in an aggregated state, which appears to enhance the energy transfer efficiency as seen by a fluorescence emission in the red region of the spectrum (675 nm). This year, in vitro shifts in absorption in purified allophycocyanin solutions have been produced. This is the first step in attempts to reconstitute functional phycobilisomes in vitro.
The use of such seemingly simpler single-celled biological systems has been productive. Another type of organism, the large, multinucleate single-celled fungus, Phycomyces, has been studied for many years. Aerial cells (sporangiophores) respond rapidly in a number of ways to environmental stimuli. The chief advantage of Phycomyces has been that growth responses were known to occur localized in the same region of the cell where the environmental signals are received, quite unlike flowering plants, which have a
134 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 145>>>

complex system of hormones that move from one region of the plant to another. In the past few years, data have been published that such hormones also may be involved in the Phycomyces system. It was discovered in this Laboratory that continuous exposure to high-intensity blue light will cause the sporangiophores to stop growing by elongation and, after a period of a few hours, to initiate a branch cell that elongates for many hours. The system also demonstrates apical dominance, in that two branches sometimes are formed, one of which exerts control and elongates, while the other is inhibited. If the spherical sporangium, at the upper end of the dominant branch sporangiophore, is mechanically removed, growth is initiated in the previously inhibited branch. We have been able to confirm this phenomenon and have observed that application of the plant growth hormone, auxin (indoleacetic acid), in about 50 percent of all experiments, is able to prevent branching. It appears that high-intensity blue light selectively destroys the sensitivity of the growing cell to hormonal materials being produced by the sporangium, since it has not been possible to produce branches by irradicating the sporangium alone. Each mature sporangium contains about one million vegetative spores, and the active material appears to be produced by these spores. The application of a number of auxin inhibitors and antagonists, known to interfere with the effects of auxin or the flow of auxins in higher plants, has not led to branch formation in Phycomyces.
Most fungal cells contain carotenoid pigments responsible for the yellow, orange, and red colors observed. These same compounds occur in higher plants and in animals. Some of these pigments are the accessory pigments for photosynthesis and are also precursors for Vitamin A synthesis. In many organisms the carotenoids have a protective function against adverse effects of visible light, and in addition they have other, unknown, functions.
In the orange bread mold, Neurospora crassa, blue light is required to initiate the biosynthesis of at least eight different carotenoid pigments. From experimental data using biochemical inhibitors, it has been proposed that one or more enzymes in the carotenoid pathway are absent or at low levels in dark-grown Neurospora cultures and that the activity of these enzymes increases following light exposure. One way of testing this hypothesis is to examine biochemically the precursors of the carotenoid pigments. Phytoene, a
Science / 135

<<<Page: 146>>>

40-carbon colorless compound, accumulates in dark-grown cultures. The enzyme activity that catalyzes the biosynthesis of phytoene from isopentenyl-pyrophosphate has been partially purified. Even though phytoene can be produced by dark-grown cultures, the activity is higher in cells which were exposed to blue light prior to extraction. Thus, light may regulate both the biosynthesis of phytoene, as well as its subsequent conversion to carotenoids. In order to separate these two processes, it will be necessary to investigate the regulation of each enzyme in the pathway.
Temperature changes can also regulate carotenoid production in Neurospora. The optimum temperature for carotenoid biosynthesis following a light exposure is 6°C. Mutants have been isolated which have the same optimum, but carotenoid production is relatively insensitive to higher temperatures. For example, at 25°C to 37°C these mutants accumulate more pigment than the wild type strain. The gene containing the mutation has been mapped and found to be on the right arm of Chromosome IV.
One of the pigments involved in the regulation of green plant development is the chromoprotein phytochrome. This pigment regulates a wide variety of plant responses, from flowering, stem growth, and seed germination to chlorophyll synthesis. Much effort has been devoted to characterizing this pigment because of its ubiquitous and important nature. Characterization has been hampered by two factors. One is the low concentration of phytochrome in the plant cell, and the second is the presence of other molecules which alter the structure of proteins when the plant tissue is broken up for extraction. Both of these factors have led to spurious artifacts. It was discovered by this Laboratory recently that highly purified phytochrome solutions previously thought to be free of significant contaminants contained another protein that could only be separated from phytochrome by ultracentrifugation. In addition, the structural features observed by electron microscopy and previously ascribed to phytochrome are actually due to the presence of the contaminating protein. These data led to a reexamination of the phytochrome molecule. Electrophoretic and ultracentrifugal studies confirm that phytochrome exists in solution as a dimer. Analysis of gel filtration and ultracentrifugal data led to a description of phytochrome as an elongated molecule, described as a cigar-shaped structure with an axial ratio on the order of 8 to 1. The dimer dis-

sociates as the alkalinity of the solution is increased. Even under conditions routinely used in isolating phytochrome, some dissociation occurs. Such dissociation may account for some of the conflicting descriptions from other laboratories of the properties of phytochrome.
In addition, a purported photoreversible pigment system, driven by blue and yellow light from the alga Protosiphon, was examined because of its similarities to the photoreversible phytochrome molecule. However, the data indicate that the isolated pigment is probably not photoreversible by yellow light, since it reverts to the blue-absorbing form in the dark, with nearly identical kinetics observed under yellow light. The suggestion was made that the pigment plastocyanin is involved in this system, but data from mutants of Chlamydomonas which lack plastocyanin did not support this hypothesis.
The phytochrome molecule acts as the receptor molecule for the control of reproductive development. When light signals are received from the environment, either inhibition or promotion occurs that is dependent upon both the species of plant and the time in the developmental cycle during which the signal is received. Normally, the red portion of sunlight predominates during the day, with marked increases in the far-red portion near sunrise and sunset. Experiments conducted with a long-day plant, Wintex barley, indicate that high levels of far-red light (700-800 nm), if maintained throughout the day, significantly promote the induction of flowers, when compared to plants grown with equally photosynthetically active energies but without the additional far-red light.
Once flowering is induced by an appropriate light signal, internal biochemical changes occur that are transmitted from the sensitive leaves to the vegetative buds which become flowers. The nature of this chemical stimulus is unknown. This material is carried in the phloem sap. One way of obtaining sufficient phloem sap for analysis is to take advantage of the fact that aphids feeding upon plants insert a stylet directly into the phloem tissue. Droplets of honeydew can be collected from the aphids feeding on plants that have been induced to flower, and, assuming that no appreciable chemical changes have occurred in the passage of the active material through the aphid, it should be possible to identify the flowering stimulus. Salicylic acid was identified in honeydew, and salicylic acid has
Science / 137

<<<Page: 148>>>

been found by this technique to induce flowering in test plants of duckweed (Lemna gibba). Other materials known to be present are being tested in reference to their involvement in the flowering process. In addition, salicylic acid is being tested on a number of plant species, including several different Lemnaceae.
Besides its regulatory effect upon growth processes, light is important for photosynthesis. The efficiency of light usage in photosynthesis is very low: about two percent of the incident energy is utilized. In some regions of the world, plants are grown under artificial lighting to produce prime horticultural and floricultural products. The electrical energy used is mostly produced from fossil fuels, thereby depleting a nonrenewable resource. The mode of light used for this purpose traditionally has been continuous light. However, work completed thirty years. ago under flashing light conditions produced by mechanical devices indicated an increased efficiency in the photosynthetic utilization of light. The Radiation Biology Laboratory has recently been testing a prototypical, electronically controlled, flashing fluorescent lamp system in a controlled environment for plant growth. Preliminary testing of the light utilization in the flashing mode versus continuous application of equal total energy indicates an increase of as much as 30 percent in photosynthetic efficiency. Such data should also lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms occurring in photosynthesis.
Salt marshes along the Atlantic seaboard are thought to be among the most productive ecosystems, and it has been assumed that much of the solar energy fixed as carbon compounds by photosynthesis finds its way into the adjacent estuaries, where fish and shellfish spend a part of their life cycle. In association with measurements of the incident solar radiation, measurements have also been made of the primary productivity of selected portions of two salt marsh communities. One of these communities is dominated by a sedge and the other by a mixture of two grass species. From measurements taken at different times during the growing season, estimates were made of the net carbon assimilated. More carbon was found to be assimilated by these communities than could be accounted for on the basis of measurements of the total mass of plant and animal matter in the community. These data substantiate the notion that
138 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 149>>>

these salt marsh communities are supplying significant amounts of carbon to the adjacent estuaries.
In order to make these correlations, measurements of the incident solar radiation were needed. Such a monitoring program has been in progress for six years by the Laboratory. The program for measuring and monitoring the ultraviolet erythemal (sunburn) energy (285 to 320 nm in 5nm increments) content of daylight was initiated last year. A preliminary analysis of the data indicates a pattern for this energy at the earth’s surface at various latitudes for the northern hemisphere. As anticipated, the amount of ultraviolet erythemal radiation increases from the pole to the equator, with more detectable energy at the shorter wavelengths as one moves toward the equator. Also, the amount of ozone decreases as one approaches the equator.
The data for these trends have been obtained from four scanning radiometers developed and constructed by the Radiation Biology Laboratory. Ozone calculations from the ultraviolet measurements at the Panama station indicate very little variation in ozone thickness seasonally, while measurements from the other stations indicate more seasonal variations for higher latitudes.
There have been other phenomena observed in the data. Besides an increasing variability in daily ozone measurements with increasing latitude, there is the appearance of a cycle in the ozone data at three sites simultaneously. This cycle appears to be of about 27 to 30 days and occurs in data from November 1975 to June 1976. More data will be needed to ascertain the existence of this observed cyclical event.
The data collected on the spectral quality of daylight are being analyzed for long-term trends and variability at various locations. The analysis has begun using one year of data from three locations: (1) Barrow, Alaska (71°N), (2) Rockville, Maryland (39°N), and (3) Panama Canal Zone (9°N). The analysis was performed using the daily amounts of irradiance in each of the 100-nanometer (nm)wide spectral bands from 400 nm to 800 nm, the total irradiance (300 nm—2800 nm), and the infrared region from 800 nm to 2800 nm. The data were collected using precision Eppley pyranometers and automated acquisition systems.
The analysis of the 1974 data clearly showed that the determi-

nation of the available solar energy and the spectral quality of that energy can only be obtained from direct measurements if data better than +25 percent are required. Also, it may be quite impossible to predict long-term trends without measurements taken over many years. Such things as spectral quality changes, and losses in energy such as those found at Washington, D.C., and Mount Saint Katherine, Egypt, cannot be predicted with only five or six years’ data.
Another fact clearly shown in the analysis is that there are not only major differences in the spectral quality of daylight from place to place, but large variations in the spectral distribution can occur at any one location, especially around sunrise and sunset.
For the 1974 data, the average daily amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the earth, compared to that available daily at the top of the atmosphere, is approximately 40 percent at Barrow, Alaska (71°N) and about 53 percent at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal (9°N). The variations in these values are relatively large: from 5 percent to 65 percent at Barrow, 30 percent to 50 percent at Rockville, and 48 percent to 60 percent in Panama, where the atmosphere is generally clear.
If data from a longer period of time are used—for example the data from Rockville for seven years—then different mean values for the year will be obtained. For Rockville, an average value of 46 percent of the solar energy available at the top of the atmosphere falling on the earth’s surface is obtained, with a variation in the average of only 41 percent—51 percent. The measured values of the average energy available for over three quarters of the time range from 5 percent to 75 percent. Therefore, it is apparent that the use of calculated rather than measured values of solar radiation in solar energy applications must be done with great care.
In photosynthesis, radioactive ‘carbon naturally occurring in the atmospheric carbon dioxide is assimilated. This '*C decays with time and can be used to determine the age of once-living materials. Using this technique in collaboration with the Institution staff and in cooperative research with some twenty other institutions and universities, the relationships are being investigated between changing environments and changing cultures, and research is being done on the early human occupation of the Americas. Of necessity, this requires more than the straightforward construction of chronolo-

gies, for research must be carried out in all the fields of archeology, geology, sedimentology, pollen analysis, sea-level changes, etc., in order to understand why peoples move, why cultures change.
Current reversal in the Mediterranean Basin 10,000 years ago, first noted through sediment studies at the Strait of Gibraltar, has been confirmed by similar studies at the Strait of Sicily and the underwater cone of the Nile Delta. The entire Basin was subjected to drastic environmental change, and the concomitant change in human culture must have been equally great. The documentation of a succession of rapid climatic changes in Labrador and along the coast of northeastern North America has been keyed to successive movements and occupations by Eskimo and Indian groups, and the continued dating of pollen cores throughout the area will provide confirmatory evidence of geomorphological and ecological events and parameters.
Continued excavations at Meadowcroft Rockshelter in western Pennsylvania have revealed some very early levels of occupation. Two samples, one of charcoal and the other of a simple bark textile, recovered in the 1975 excavations, have been dated and are estimated to be about 19,000 years old.

Astronomy was once concerned only with observing and charting the positions and motions of the planets and stars. Joy and satisfaction came from seeing the beauty and symmetry of these distant celestial bodies. The sense of wonder basic to astronomy naturally evolved into a desire to understand the physical composition of these celestial objects. Thus developed the science of astrophysics: the application of the prinicples of physics to the study of the stars, and, in particular at the Smithsonian Institution, the sun.
At the turn of the century, the basic tools of astrophysics were optical telescopes and spectrographs. Following World War II, astrophysics expanded to include radio observations of stars, planets, and galaxies. Now the concept of astrophysics has broadened again. The stars are no longer considered static entities, but rather dynamic bodies that change and evolve—being born, matur-

ing, aging, and dying much like living organisms. Thanks to the space program, modern astronomers can now observe radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum—from radio waves that are meters long to gamma rays, trillions of times shorter. During the past two decades, with each new wavelength revealing new insights on the complex nature of the universe, astrophysics has become an especially challenging and exciting branch of science.
To theoretical astrophysicists, the future of this science seems exciting indeed. Astronomers have discovered quasars, pulsars, cosmic masers, X-ray sources, and black holes. But even more exciting is the prospect of studying these mysterious objects with the radio, optical, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray techniques that first revealed them. Some clues have already been discovered. For example, the quasars seem to have points of similarity with the X-ray sources discovered by satellite experiments, in which a spinning disk of matter is thought to be swallowed slowly by a black hole. The quasars appear to be a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale. To generate the tremendous energy of quasars, the black holes within them would have to weigh as much as 100 million suns.
Each of these discoveries, fascinating in itself, contributes to our understanding of the processes by which the universe has expanded, galaxies have been formed, and stars have evolved over the past 15 billion years. Dying stars apparently eject new chemical elements into space, in which they are available for forming new stars and planets—some of them with life. The intellectual synthesis describing this process might be called “Cosmic Evolution,” with an impact rivaling that of the Darwinian theory of biological evolution. This synthesis may account for all the structures in the universe, from quasars to planets.
Particularly exciting is the prospect for future study of the processes that connect cosmic evolution with the evolution of life. If life originated from nonliving matter early in the history of the solar system, according to the laws of physics and chemistry, then perhaps some day we can predict which stars have life, and even which stars have intelligent life with which we might communicate.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sao) is participating fully in the exploration of the frontiers of astrophysics. Only a large, multidisciplinary organization can muster the scientific capability and technical expertise necessary to exploit and utilize the full

range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma rays. Accordingly, in 1973, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory were joined, under a single director, as the Center for Astrophysics, in order to pursue excellence in astrophysical research by developing the potential of both organizations. Today, with over 140 scientists and 500 staff members, in Cambridge and at field stations around the world, the Center represents the nation’s largest observatory.
The research of the Center is organized by divisions representing major fields of study; and, as the following summaries show, the Center is making important scientific progress.
One of the most exciting discoveries in the field of astronomy during the past year was the detection of giant bursts of X-ray emission from the centers of globular clusters of stars. The first and largest of these extraordinary X-ray sources was found by scientists at the Center for Astrophysics working with data taken by an experiment aboard the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ans). The sudden burst of energy, comparable to the 30-fold brightening of an optical object, was seen from a cluster in the constellation Sagittarius. Subsequently, at least another dozen of these so-called “X-ray bursters” were identified by Center scientists and a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the latter group using data from the Small Astronomy Satellite (sas-3).
The bursts of X-ray radiation are thought to be associated with giant black holes weighing the equivalent of several hundred suns, which may represent an intermediate stage between stellar black holes and the quasi-stellar black holes with a mass 100 million times that of the sun.
An X-ray experiment using a two-dimensional low-resolution mirror and imaging system was flown aboard a rocket. In addition to observations of extragalactic X-ray sources, the experiment obtained the data that produced the first X-ray map of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, showing both extended emission regions and the galaxy NGc 1275. That gallaxy is the most intense source of X-ray emission discovered.
Work continued on the experiments scheduled for flight aboard the upcoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration

Left. A rocket-borne X-ray telescope launched from White Sands Missile Range December 1975 produced this image of X-ray emissions from the Perseus cluster, an ensemble of some 1,000 galaxies located about 300 million light years from earth. The image shows a broad area of diffuse X-ray emission estimated as several million light years in diameter. Intense emission is seen from the Seyfert galaxy NGc 1275 at the center of the cluster, indicating that the object is perhaps the most powerful X-ray source known, some million times more luminous than the sum of all the X-ray sources in our own galaxy. Right.

(nasa) series of High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO) satellites, the first of which is planned for late 1977. A major effort has been devoted to construction of the cosmic X-ray telescope aboard the HEAO-B, due to fly in 1978. This telescope will be capable of detecting tens of thousands of X-ray sources, some more distant than the most distant galaxies now seen from ground-based telescopes.
Experiments proposed by the division have also been selected for flight on the Hea Transient Explorer satellite and the Soft X-ray and euv Explorer satellite.
The all-sky survey of high-energy gamma-ray sources using a 10-meter reflector at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, neared completion after an intense observation campaign during the past year.
Two major satellite experiments conceived and designed by Division members culminated with successful launches in the spring.

Lageos, an extremely dense, mechanically and electrically inert, passive satellite fitted with retroreflectors was launched by nasa on May 4, 1976. The satellite, which has an orbital lifetime estimated in millions of years, will serve as a stable reference for ground-based laser tracking stations, including those of the Smithsonian, thus providing data on crustal movements, polar motion, and variations in the rotation of the earth.
At an altitude of 5,900 km and with a magnitude of 13, the Lageos satellite was thought too faint to be photographed by the network’s Baker-Nunn camera; indeed, it was expected that 60 days would be needed for initial observations. Yet the Baker-Nunn camera on the island of Maui, Hawaii, photographed the satellite on its first orbit, just 90 minutes after launch, and other network cameras photographed the object shortly thereafter. Using the camera data to improve pointing predictions, the Mount Hopkins, Arizona, laser obtained returns within 3 days after launch. Lasers in Peru and Brazil were successful as well, and routine tracking of this geodetic reference point, including daytime observations, began nearly 2 months ahead of schedule.
During the next four years, geophysicists hope to obtain range data (laser-to-satellite distance) accurate to 10 cm, with the distances between the ground stations measured to comparable accuracies. By the 1980s, this accuracy is expected to be 2 cm, or about the distance that Europe and North America are suspected of drifting apart annually.
On June 18, 1976, a Smithsonian-designed and -built hydrogen maser clock, so accurate that it loses only 1 second in 10 million years, was launched by nasa on a 2-hour suborbital flight to test the equivalence principle, a cornerstone of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. In the test, time aboard the spacecraft was measured against a duplicate ground-based clock to an accuracy of 1 part in 10'*. According to Einstein’s theory, the space clock should run faster once free of the earth’s gravitational field.
The payload reached an altitude of 10,000 km with a flight time of 1"56™. The probe maser functioned properly throughout the flight, as did the ground-based equipment. Initial analysis of the data, considered some 100 times more accurate than any previous ground-based experiments, indicates Einstein’s theory is correct.

mosphere, satellite-tracking operations were conducted in close cooperation with nasa, the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, and the Institut fiir Angewandte Geodasie. As coordinator of all international laser networks, sao provided orbital elements, scheduling, and general operational support for all the overseas lasers participating in the campaign to track the Geos 3 satellite. Laser data were also acquired on a number of other retroreflector satellites for use in the development of the gravity-field and geodetic models of the earth.
An analytical theory for determining the nongravitational effects of solar radiation pressure, albedo pressure, and infrared pressure on artificial satellites, was developed for the first time.
A complex theory for ocean tides was devised that incorporates existing theories on perturbations due to the sun and the moon, as well as those due to the earth’s solid body tides caused by the sun and the moon. The new theory includes ocean tidal loading on the solid earth.
Ionospheric data collected by the doppler-tracking experiment on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astr) of 1975 were reduced. This experiment was designed to detect large concentrations of mass in the earth beneath the satellites. Work this year was devoted to removing propagation errors from raw measurements of the relative velocity between the Apollo spacecraft and the aster docking module, with the resulting data to be inverted into gravity-field anomalies. These data also represent valuable horizontal sounding samples of the ionosphere at the 220-km orbital height.
The primary research of this Division continues to focus on the study of the sun as a star, with related programs designed to understand similar physical processes observed in other stars.
Basic to this research has been the continued analysis of solar data obtained by Harvard experiments aboard the Skylab satellite during the 1973-1974 flight. These data, in the form of thousands of photographs, were taken by two different instruments—one sensitive to ultraviolet emissions, the other to X-rays—and they are being analyzed by two different groups within the Division.
The analyses have resulted in detailed numerical models describing the physical mechanisms for energy flow in the sun’s corona and

the acceleration of solar wind. It has been found that the solar wind, which strikes the earth, is controlled by a magnetic field deep within the body of the sun.
This discovery has major implications for understanding physical processes and motions below the solar surface. Moreover, this discovery may allow earth-bound investigators to predict periods of solar-wind activity through observations of changes in the sun’s surface features.
An excellent example of Harvard-Smithsonian collaboration in scientific endeavor is the establishment of the Langley-Abbot program of solar research. Funded by the Institution and using Harvard satellite data, the program will attempt to integrate current theory and observation of solar processes with historical studies of solar variability in a critical assessment of the interrelationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena, particularly long-term climatic change.
During the past year, activities in the Langley-Abbot program included analysis of possible solar “constant” variations from the original Abbot data and more modern Mariner and Nimbus spacecraft data; measurement of the differential rotation of solar magnetic fields and the photosphere; theoretical analyses of the implications of such data and related observations on the solar cycle and long-term solar variability; data analysis and theoretical studies of the interaction of solar plasma and magnetic fields in active regions; prominences and flares; and the continuing analytic studies of long-term terrestrial climatic variation and its possible relation to solar activity.
Harvard-Smithsonian collaboration in radio astronomy has been active for many years in a cooperative program designed to detect and measure the very faint radio signals emitted by molecules in interstellar space.
The list of newly discovered interstellar molecules grows every day, with scientific interest and anticipation mounting as more and more complex organic molecules are found in the space between the stars. For example, in the past year, Division scientists detected interstellar nitrogen sulphide. Although no one expects to find living organisms in space, there is hope that molecules of biological inter-

est will be discovered, thus providing a step toward understanding the origin of life on earth.
The Division also began a program that applies the techniques of ground-based millimeter-wave radio astronomy to the problem of measuring the photochemical ozone balance in the earth’s atmosphere. Scientists measured H:O and O; in the earth’s mesophere and developed mathematical models for determining the altitude distributions of the two substances. The design and construction of a millimeter-wave atmospheric spectrometer for this program were completed, and a method of predicting the millimeter-wave spectra of heavy organic molecules was developed to support this program.
Using the Harvard radio astronomy facility at Fort Davis, Texas, Center scientists participated in an expanded collaborative program of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (viB1) with a number of other radio astronomy institutions. The visi technique utilizes several widely separated radio antennas to observe celestial sources of radio emission. This technique has the effect of extending the “size” of the radio receivers to a diameter of hundreds, or even thousands, of miles. The difference in arrival time of received radio signals at the various ground stations provides highly accurate angular resolution. The initial studies of this ambitious program concentrated on radio galaxies, quasars, and oH masers, including, in one case, an unprecedented eight-station experiment to map quasars at the 18-cm wavelength. An extremely precise hydrogen maser clock, built by the same team that prepared the clock for space flight in the gravity probe experiment, was developed for use in the radio project.
By combining Harvard laboratory facilities with Smithsonian theoretical research support, programs in the Division are influenced and inspired by the diverse activities and needs of astrophysics. The goal is to provide the basic parameters of atomic and molecular physics required to understand physical processes and thus to aid in the interpretation of observational data obtained by other Center groups.
Theoretical studies in the field of atomic structure and processes concentrated on the application of model potential methods for the accurate calculation of properties of complex atoms, and the de-

velopment of a relativistic generalization of the random phase approximation for studying the properties of highly stripped atomic species.
In the field of molecular structure and processes, progress has been made in large scale ab initio calculations of potential energy curves, methods for including electronic continuum functions in molecular calculations, and the use of model potential and random phase approximation methods in molecular physics.
Atomic and molecular data have been used in theoretical studies of the thermosphere of the earth, for comparison with the in situ measurements obtained by the nasa Atmospheric Explorer Satellite system, in order to obtain a quantitative understanding of the physical and chemical processes. The absorption of solar Euv radiation and photoelectrons in the atmosphere and the photochemical equilibrium in concentrations have been calculated. Using the satellite observations, information on the O» concentration, the total ionization rate due to the solar ultraviolet flux, and the thermal budget of the ionosphere can be obtained. Some preliminary studies of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter and Mars have been carried out.
The Planetary Sciences Division is somewhat unusual in that considerably more attention is given to the smaller bodies of the solar system than to the larger ones. This emphasis has recently received a unique form of recognition: the asteroids numbered 1877, 1880, 1881, 1913, and 1940 have been named Marsden, McCrosky, Shao, Sekanina, and Whipple, respectively, in honor of the scientific contributions of these Center staff members. An astrometric program at Harvard’s Agassiz station has contributed to the awarding of those honors; more than 500 positions of faint asteroids and comets have been measured, leading to the assignment of permanent numbers to thirteen minor planets. Much of this activity has been made possible through the development of a program to reduce the uncertainties in comet and asteroid orbits and to reconcile apparently conflicting observations.
Several members of the Division maintain an active interest in comets. Investigations of comet orbit clustering have led to the conclusion that there is less evidence than previously thought for the reality of comet pairs. Work continued on the process of comet

splitting, particularly on the possibility that a very large number of new comets would be deflected into the inner solar system where the large release of cometary gases could have formed a secondary solar nebula early in the history of the solar system. Photometric studies on the properties of cometary tails continued, with a concentration on predicted observability of ‘‘antitails.’” These predictions have been verified by a number of recent observations and give interesting physical information about cometary particles in the millimeter-to-centimeter size range. Studies of nongravitational forces affecting cometary projectories also continued.
In meteor research, the Prairie Network observing stations have been closed, but analysis of network observations continues. A cooperative program with groups in Albany and Ottawa has been conducted to measure the spectra of faint meteors from ground and aircraft. These groups have had some successful runs with observations of meteor showers and are beginning the reduction of the data. This program is expected to continue for two more years.
Work relating to the outer planets included research on the properties of Saturn’s rings, particularly the structure of the gaps in the rings, which are associated with satellite resonances. Ring-particle scattering apparently plays an important role in widening these gaps, and the current estimate of ring particle size is of the order of a meter. The ephemerides of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, as well as knowledge about their diameters, have been improved through analysis of their mutual occultations. In cooperation with the California Institute of Technology, efforts are being made to discover new faint satellites of Jupiter.
A strong program of research on lunar and meteorite samples has been maintained by Division members who have also organized two consortia to coordinate research in lunar geology. One of these, the Consortium Indomitable, worked on the analysis of samples from a large lunar boulder; the other, new consortium, the Consortium Imbrium, has been formed to study ejecta from the Imbrium basin. In addition, the analysis of solar-wind gases trapped in the lunar materials has placed a meaningful upper limit on the amount of tritium in the solar wind and has allowed a positive identification of carbon 14.
Members of the Division are also engaged in a variety of theoretical programs. An investigation of the theory of Cassini states

has predicted that the lunar spin axis points to within a few degrees of the earth-moon system, and further predicts that the earth-spin axis will undergo wild gyrations about two billion years in the future. Similar studies are being applied to Venus. A new theory was developed to account for the large eccentricity of Mercury’s orbit, which involves passing the planet through two resonances with Venus and requires that a certain limit exist on the spin-down time of the sun. Evolutionary sequences of models of the primitive solar nebula were constructed, with each treating the nebula as a viscous accretion disk. According to the theoretical studies, the solar nebula should have become repeatedly unstable against global gravitational instabilities, and an investigation of the properties of the giant gaseous proto-planets that would result from such instabilities has begun. Also studied was a collision theory of lunar formation, in which a large collision in the late stages of formation of the earth inefficiently places vaporized and condensed rocky material in earth orbit, from which the moon can collect by gravitational instabilities.
The research of the Optical and Infrared Astronomy Division may be divided according to the areas and objects of interest and according to facilities and instrumentation.
In the former scheme of division, a major interest is extragalactic work. The spectra of active galaxies that emit large amounts of energy in the infrared, such as the Seyfert galaxy NGc 1068, were studied by means of both a 1-m balloon-borne telescope and a ground-based instrument at the Kitt Peak National Observatory fitted with a circular variable filter. The data show complexity in the spectrum, including line emission, which indicated that no single simple model can explain the infrared emission.
The optical variability of several quasi-stellar or BL-Lacertae objects was studied. The observations revealed large variations, the peaks of which show very great luminosities of these objects at cosmological distances.
Two techniques are being used to search for halos of faint red stars around galaxies, which could represent large amounts of mass. An essentially negative measurement was made of NGc 4565, an edge-on spiral, by use of a silicon vidicon camera. Additional studies

will continue with the ccp camera under development at the Center. Preliminary measurements with photographic emulsions and grid technique to get reliable low-contrast results were also made.
The problem of twoand three-body correlations for the distribution of galaxies was studied. This work has shown that extensive, careful red-shift measurements, combined with positional data, can be of great cosmological interest when compared with theory.
Work on the interstellar medium includes study of H 1 regions at both nearand far-infrared wavelengths, again utilizing data from both balloonand ground-based observations. Mapping of the Orion and w3 regions, and near-infrared measurements of various regions, will aid in the understanding of how energy is distributed between gas and dust.
A large proportion of the research on stars is centered on the use of optical observations in conjunction with X-ray data to study the properties of highly condensed objects interacting with normal companions in binary systems. An identification of these companions and studies of their variability were made, both on shortand long-time scales. In the latter case, the studies were made possible by the archival photographs in the Harvard plate collection. Intensive studies were made of the centers of globular clusters which emit X-ray bursts in a search for optical clues to this unusual phenomenon. A study of abundances in Sirius has been conducted to see whether mass transfer between it and its companion could have affected nucleosynthesis in this system. Ultraviolet studies of X-ray sources will be made with the rve satellite.
In planetary research, a definitive determination of the temperature of Uranus was made with the balloon instrument calibrated by means of the model for the time-dependent effective temperature of Mars.
In terms of observing facilities, the Division’s activities were many and varied. A duplicate version of the Mount Hopkins echelle spectrograph was installed on the 61-inch telescope at Agassiz Station in Massachusetts, and will be supplemented with an electrographic camera, permitting effective use of the telescope in the prevailing nonphotometric conditions. A novel fast spectrograph is being constructed to permit lower-resolution observations of fainter objects.

in the operation of the Boyden Observatory in South Africa because the remoteness of the station made research there costly and ineffective. New locations are being considered for Harvard’s Southern Hemisphere Damon patrol cameras that have been at Boyden.
The major commitment in observing facilities is at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, where the installation of the Multiple Mirror Telescope has begun, in collaboration with the University of Arizona. The Mount Hopkins complex now operates on a reliable commercial power line from the valley, and improvements to the road and water system continue.
The 60-inch telescope was refurbished this year, with recoating of the primary mirror (done at Kitt Peak) and subsequent use of the primary in testing the figure of a new secondary mirror (made by the University of Arizona’s Optical Science Center). This lightweight mirror is designed for infrared work and is now mounted on an oscillating support designed and built, together with its drive, at the Center. The improved system allows sky subtraction for infra-

During fiscal year 1976, the 24-inch telescope of the State University of New York at Stony Brook was brought into full operation under our collaborative arrangement. Used for photometry and spectroscopy, it is being designed to accept instruments from the 60-inch telescope.
The Multiple Mirror Telescope (mmr) Program jointly carried out by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory is proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The optics are essentially complete, and the active-optics alignment system is nearing completion, with both tasks undertaken at the University of Arizona. The final subcontract, for actual fabrication of the optical support structure, was let in the summer; construction and testing should be complete by February 1977. The construction of the mat housing is proceeding nearly on schedule, under the direction of Aeronutronic-Ford Western Development Laboratories, the prime contractor for all the structural mechanical work. The pier and foundation are complete, and the bearing support and yoke base have been installed by the Smithsonian. Erection of the housing and its support and drive system will take place during the summer and early fall, allowing for the completion of the yoke installation, under shelter, before the end of 1976. After the erection of the optical support structure, scheduled for February 1977, installation of the optical components can begin and should be completed during the spring of 1977. Serious testing and provisional operation of the telescope should take place during the summer of 1977.
The Theoretical Astrophysics Division performs research in a wide range of astrophysical topics, with theoretical studies often applied to the support and interpretation of observational data. Members of the Division frequently work in collaboration with members of other divisions as well as with scientists in other institutions. In addition, they contribute substantially to the educational program of the Department of Astronomy.

on the role of atomic and molecular processes in astrophysics. A relativistic generalization of the random phase approximation was developed and is proving to be a powerful new tool for the treatment of elements of high nuclear charges.
A pulsating white dwarf model for explaining the X-ray pulsars was devised, in which the pulsations are driven by nuclear burning of accepted hydrogen from a binary companion.
Similarly, a model developed for the formation of oB stars in a molecular cloud suggests that an os star can drive an ionization and shock front into a molecular cloud, which will trigger the formation of a second os star. The process repeats to form a chain of os stars.
Investigations were made of the possible noncosmological production of deuterium and other light elements; of the spatial distribution of galaxies; of the propagation of acoustic waves in stellar atmospheres, with particular application to the heating of the low solar chromosphere; and of the radiative transfer and line formation

in sources with spherical geometry and with velocity fields.
Studies of the evolution of close binary stars indicate that in an early phase of evolution the binaries were in contact and may have lost a substantial amount of mass and angular momentum at that time.
The growth of the central galaxy in a rich cluster of galaxies, due to its accretion of other cluster galaxies, was studied. Also, a variety of scenarios was developed to describe formation of a large black hole in a globular cluster.
Studies of stellar turbulence driven by tidal distortion revealed that tidally induced shear probably cannot cause turbulence in an otherwise stable star.
The unified gauge theory of weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions was used to study neutrino-pressure supernova models.
Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc.
The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc. (ssre) has had another year of growth in fiscal year 1976. Not only has there been increasing recognition of the importance of ongoing research information as a tool for the management and planning of research, but new approaches have been developed to make ongoing research information in the ssieE data base more readily available.
The Exchange sought to increase the comprehensiveness and coverage of information in its data base in a number of areas of major importance to the national interest. Two such areas were in the fields of cancer and energy research. New sources of input in both these fields were forthcoming at the national and international level, and more than 4,000 new projects were added to the system in these two areas alone.
In the field of energy research, the Exchange prepared, under a National Science Foundation grant, the first directory on Information on International Research and Development Activities in the Field of Energy, which was published by the National Science Foundation. Because of the Exchange’s success in obtaining input from five European countries and Canada this first year, the project has been extended for a second year, and arrangements have been completed for obtaining information from three new countries,
Science / 159

<<<Page: 170>>>

Sweden, Denmark, and Israel. The possibility of adding input from other foreign countries is also being explored. A concerted effort has been undertaken to obtain new national energy research information from nonfederal organizations, such as the Electrical Power Research Institute and the Petroleum Research Institute.
Through its operation of the Current Cancer Research Project Analysis Center for the International Cancer Research Data Bank program of the National Cancer Institute, the Exchange has increased its data base of information about ongoing cancer research, both nationally and internationally. The program is particularly significant not only in terms of identifying research in progress worldwide, but also in terms of the Exchange’s output products and services, which are distributed by the National Cancer Institute to scientists in this country and abroad. During fiscal year 1976, the Exchange prepared eight major directories of cancer research and some fourteen special listings of cancer research in highly specific subject areas. Copies of the latter were made available to research investigators worldwide whose research projects appeared in each of the special categories. In addition, information on all research projects in the cancer field, registered at sstE, were made available on-line through the computer facility at the National Library of Medicine. This program is expected to continue throughout the coming year and become increasingly valuable as more research information is fed into the data base.
During the year, the Exchange began preparing a quarterly directory of ongoing research information in toxicology for the Toxicology Information Subcommittee of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare’s Committee of Coordinate Toxicology and Related Programs. The directory, published quarterly by the National Technical Information Service, will have an annual cumulative index covering research projects indexed throughout the year. The response to the project was enthusiastic and the project has been continued for a second year.
The Exchange also continued to prepare directories for publication by various federal agencies in Water Resources Research, Disaster Related Technology, and Dental Research.
In 1975 and 1976 the Exchange, with the support of the National Science Foundation, began to develop a more extensive program to identify international data sources of ongoing research information
160 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 171>>>

which could be of major importance and use to research planners and managers in various scientific fields. As a part of this effort, the first International Symposium on Information Systems and Services in Ongoing Research in Science, sponsored by the unisIsT program of unesco in collaboration with sste, was held in Paris in October 1975.
The Exchange is currently preparing, in cooperation with the UNISIST program of UNESCO, a directory of ongoing research systems worldwide in order to further the exchange of information between developed and developing countries. Efforts are currently underway to identify problem areas which might develop as actual exchange of scientific information between countries becomes a reality. As a follow-up to the symposium, the uNIsIsT program expects to develop an office for ongoing research, which will have a working group of international experts in the field to help identify and suggest ways to resolve problems that might develop in the exchange of information between countries. In addition to working with unisist, the Exchange is currently exploring the possibility of bilateral cooperation with several countries, including the leasing of the sste data base, exchange of information in selected subject areas, and development of bilingual indexing terminology to facilitate exchange of information.
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
Many people living in temperate regions still regard the tropics as a “green hell” of steaming jungles inhabited by all manner of fierce and unfriendly creatures. Part of our work at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (str1) is to correct this notion. Our primary concern is to support studies that will help to place the ecological, evolutionary, and sociological processes occurring in the tropics into a proper perspective relative to the world ecosystem. Just as we have found that events in the temperate regions, such as indiscriminate use of insecticides and release of radioactive atmospheric pollutants, produce worldwide effects, so we can expect that destruction of tropical forests and pollution of coral reefs may
Science / 161

<<<Page: 172>>>

have profound and as yet unpredicted effects on the earth’s weather and ocean productivity.
The tropics contain the fastest growing segments of the human population, and the economic aspirations of this group impinge on natural areas in ways that we have only begun to understand.
In some parts of Central America more forests may exist now than existed before the Spanish exploration, when indigenous populations may have had greater acreage under cultivation; in other parts of the new world, cutting of forests is proceeding at an unprecedented rate. In tropical rain forests of the Far East, plantations of few or single species are becoming increasingly popular. Of course, such forests are more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and they can only support a much-reduced fauna compared to the mixed-species rain forest that they replace. Tropical rain forests are great storehouses of animal and plant species, and once a species is removed from the genetic pool, it cannot be restored.
sTRI is devoted to fundamental research on tropical organisms. Scientists and students seek to learn why there are more kinds of animals and plants in the tropics and how they divide the available resources. strI is engaged in a wide variety of studies; however, for purposes of this report, the focus will be on activities in two areas: forest ecology and certain aspects of the evolution of aquatic organisms.
By conducting fundamental research on the reproductive strategies of plants, ecologists on Barro Colorado Island are also learning how and why some species are better exploiters of new openings that appear in tropical forests. Clearings of various sizes appear both naturally and through human activity. Man clears forests for farms, roads, dams, etc. Nature provides clearings through single treefalls, storm-induced clearings, such as the 1.5 hectare openings produced on Barro Colorado Island in 1973; or most spectacularly, the hundreds of hectares of forest that were scoured away by the forces of an earthquake on the Colombia-Panama border last June.
Study of recolonization under natural conditions provides the kind of data needed to understand the processes of forest development, succession, and persistence. A number of workers at sTRI are looking at problems related to plant growth and success in the tropics.
Egbert Leigh went to Malaysia to continue his comparison of

lowland and montane rain forests around the world. To see whether transpiration (the evaporation of water through the stomates of leaves), which brings up water by capillary traction from the roots, plays an essential role in transporting nutrients to the tree crown, he visited montane forests in the fog belts of Costa Rica and Malaysia, where transpiration is much reduced. He hoped to discover whether the trees had adopted forms to increase transpiration rates under those conditions.
These comparisons are part of a program instituted by Martin Moynihan to determine how typical Barro Colorado is of the wet tropics around the world. Analysis indicates that the ecological organization of Barro Colorado wood and leaf production, and the spectrum of defenses from herbivores, etc., seem very similar to those of lowland Malaysian rain forests, as revealed by the 1p project there.
Mycorrhizae are specialized plant organs, formed by the association of fungi with plant roots, which absorb minerals. Almost all plant species, including many crops, can form the vesiculararbuscular (va)-type mycorrhizae. The fungi of this type have extremely broad host ranges, and are obligate root inhabitants that neither grow nor reproduce when unassociated with host roots.
David P. Janos, a str postdoctoral fellow, is developing a model of the interaction of va mycorrhizal fungus and plant communities.
Science / 163

<<<Page: 174>>>

Many canopy tree species are dependent on mycorrhizae for growth. Plant species of early successional communities are less absolute in their requirement of mycorrhizae, being adapted to greater variation in mineral and mycorrhizal fungus availability. The quantity of mycorrhizae formed in an early successional community affects the availability of inocula for subsequently colonizing species. A reduction of mycorrhizal fungus populations may impede return to climax forest.
The current study at stri is concerned first with learning whether the plant community composition reflects mineral and mycorrhizal inoculum availability. Several successional and climax species are being grown with different additions of mycorrhizal inocula and mineral nutrients. The more dependent species are expected to be incapable of growing where inocula are lacking, although this incapacity may be ameliorated by increased mineral availability. Second, stri scientists are trying to determine whether the quantity of mycorrhizae formed by the plants in a community affects subsequent inoculum availability. Repetition of the previously described experiment without further manipulation of mycorrhizal inoculum will answer this question.
Robert Silberglied joined the biological staff in January 1976. He holds a joint appointment with strr and with Harvard University as an Assistant Professor of Biology and Curator in Entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
Silberglied is studying the function of color and pattern in insect communication and orientation. Of particular interest to him are the spectacular ultraviolet reflection patterns found on the wings of certain butterflies. These patterns, visible to insects (and by photography) but not seen by man, are characterized by some of the most intense and spectrally pure colors found in nature. Since different butterfly species that appear similar to us often have radically different ultraviolet patterns, and since the sexes within a species often differ from one another in this respect, there is potential for an elaborate and very subtle communication system. By changing the colors of living butterflies in behavioral experiments, Dr. Silberglied is attempting to unravel the mysteries of this language beyond the spectrum visible to man.
Dr. Gene Montgomery has also joined stri’s permanent staff. Formerly employed by the National Zoo, Dr. Montgomery’s re-

search interests are primarily involved with the ecology of tropical mammals and so can be more conveniently pursued at str1. An expert on the radio-tracking of mammals, Dr. Montgomery will continue his studies of anteaters and sloths in Panama and Venezuela.
In an effort to further the development of a cooperative program with the Charles Darwin Research Station in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, Messrs. Rubinoff, Rand, and Borges visited there in November 1975. Discussions were held on the establishment of a marine laboratory and on the development of fellowships to encourage students to work in the Galapagos. Two str scientists went to the Galapagos in August to initiate marine studies. D. Ross Robertson was interested in the problem of resource partitioning and competition between damselfishes and surgeonfishes on coral reefs. In most coral reefs of the world, many species of both groups are found, but in the Galapagos only one species of surgeonfish is found as opposed to six species of damselfishes. During Mr. Robertson’s short trip, the patterns of spatial distribution, feeding habits, and interaction of these fish groups with the marine iguana were examined. The only marine lizard occurs there, and it is a herbivore probably competing with the fishes for food.
From October through December 1975, Tyson Roberts conducted a comprehensive biological survey of the fishes in the Fly River basin, one of the largest in Papua New Guinea. A total of about twenty-five families and eighty-five species was obtained. The fish

fauna of the Fly consists almost entirely of recent invaders from the sea or those forms that have had a long history of movement back and forth between marine and freshwater habitats.
In June a workshop met on Barro Colorado Island, to review knowledge on when and how the Isthmus of Panama was formed and to discuss the effects of its formation on the evolution of invertebrates, especially mollusks and corals. Special attention was given to possible parallels with major “crises” earlier in the fossil record, such as those resulting in extinctions of ammonites, mosasaurs, icthyosaurs, etc. Mollusks survived better on the Pacific side, which suffered less environmental disturbance, but the corals survived better in the Caribbean, largely because of trade-windinduced upwellings of deeper nutrient-laden waters in the Pacific. Where nutrients abound, algae and barnacles smother infant corals. Long absences of coral reefs are found in the fossil record, such as in the early Carboniferous items when shoal waters were probably richer in nutrients. Had this condition caused kelp beds to replace coral reefs as they do in colder, more nutrient-rich waters today?
Drs. Moynihan and Linares left for Senegal in July 1976 for a year of field work. Dr. Moynihan will be looking at the behavior of squirrels and cephalopods, while Dr. Linares will be revisiting the Diola wet rice cultivators that she studied in 1964.
A. S. Rand was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation’s United States—Latin American Cooperative Program to investigate the role of malaria in the fluctuations of the populations of lizards on Barro Colorado Island. These population changes, which do not appear to be caused by changes in food or predator abundance, may be a function of disease. Co-investigator in this study is Steven Ayala of the Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia.
In December, the second annual report of the Environmental Sciences Program’s Tropical Studies was published. Donald Windsor was the editor. This computer-assisted compilation makes possible the convenient comparison of data from 1973 and 1974 for a number of parameters. As subsequent volumes accumulate, more meaningful comparisons between annual fluctuations in environmental and biological variables will be possible.
The short-term fellowship program was expanded with a grant from the Exxon Foundation. Along with continued support from

the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation and the Edward John Noble Foundation, more than fifty students from the United States, Panama, Colombia, Germany, Great Britain, Belgium, Chile, Venezuela, and Peru were provided with fellowships to begin studies introducing them to tropical research.
Interest in tropical science is increasing, judging from the number of visitors to str1. Over 1,700 scientists and students from 39 states and 37 foreign countries, representing over 180 universities and other institutions, took advantage of str1 marine and terrestrial facilities in the last fifteen months.

Smithsonian Year 1976
Ir seems FITTING that the Smithsonian’s Bicentennial year should have turned out to be fifteen months long. As the following pages show in some detail, the history and art bureaus of the Institution produced an array of exhibitions, publications, scholarly tools and educational programs that could scarcely be expected to fit within the confines of an ordinary twelve-month year. The continuing encouragement and support of the Congress and the White House, the extraordinary dedication of hundreds of members of the Smithsonian family, the cooperation of government agencies and private institutions and individuals, and the administrative and diplomatic skills of the Institution’s Bicentennial coordinator, Susan Hamilton, made possible a program worthy both of the Smithsonian and of the great occasion we celebrated.
It will be interesting for future generations to compare our Bicentennial celebration with the Centennial that has been so brilliantly recaptured in the National Museum of History and Technology’s “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” in the Arts and Industries Building on the Mall. Perhaps our successors will see fit to do this at the time of the Tricentennial, in an exhibition called “1976,” which might be shown in the nostalgic setting of a carefully restored National Air and Space Museum.
With the Bicentennial year drawing to a close, our museums and research offices look forward to catching up on some of the important work of research, collections management, and sheer maintenance that has necessarily been deferred during the last few years. But in an Institution as vital and imaginative as the Smithsonian, that does not mean simply a return to business as usual—if, indeed, that phrase can be said to have any meaning at the Smithsonian.

<<<Page: 180>>>

The inventiveness of our directors, curators, and other specialists, the farsightedness of our Regents and Secretary, and the interested participation of our visitors and associates throughout the country all guarantee that the Institution will continue to develop in response to the needs of the time.
Archives of American Art
As a research bureau, the Archives of American Art serves scholarship by acquiring and preserving the documentary records needed by art historians and by making them known and available to researchers. The past year has seen an unusual degree of success in each of these endeavors.
Through the activities of its five regional centers, the Archives received as donations 357 collections of personal papers and institutional and business records. One of the larger of these, the papers of Thomas Casilear Cole and his family, spans a two-hundred-year period in correspondence and diaries. Other collections with useful nineteenth-century material are the papers of the sculptor John Frazee, the engraver James Barton Longacre, the painter Francis D. Millet, and the dealer J. Eastman Chase, whose records include seven Winslow Homer letters. Two important groups of letters written by the contemporary sculptors Alexander Calder and David Smith were lent for microfilming, as were the records of the early twentieth-century abstract painter Arthur Carles. Particularly useful series of letters written by Bernard Berenson, Charles Burchfield, John Steuart Curry, and Stanton Macdonald-Wright were also acquired during the year. Other twentieth-century artists represented by substantial collections of correspondence, notes, business records, photographs, and clippings are Rico Lebrun, Philip Pearlstein, Walter Quirt, Edward W. Redfield, Judson Smith, and Franklin Watkins.
Artists’ papers make up the major portion of collections received, but those of other figures in the art world are often of equal value. This year the entire corpus of records of the art historians Robert Goldwater, Millard Meiss, and Wolfgang Stechow, the curator Samuel Wagstaff, and the collector Ferdinand Howald were deposited in the Archives or lent for microfilming. The Lee Nordness Gallery

and the Finch College Museum, both significant New York institutions, also donated their records to the Archives.
A supplementary and often quite useful form of documentation is the tape-recorded interview. The Archives Oral History Program, established nearly twenty years ago, conducted taped interviews in 1976 with more than thirty artists, collectors, historians, and museum administrators, including particularly fruitful ones with James Flexner, Al Held, Marcia Marcus, Roy Neuberger, Perry Rathbone, and Otto Wittman.
“A library in disorder,” Thomas Jefferson wrote, “has little utility.” The observation applies to an archives as well, and much of the staff work of the Archives of American Art is devoted to arranging, cataloguing, and microfilming the collections it receives. During this year, 280 collections were catalogued; 2,350 catalogue and index cards were produced and distributed to each of the regional centers; and 164 rolls of film were completed and distributed.
The effect of this activity and the rising scholarly interest in American art history are reflected in the growing use made of
History and Art / 171

<<<Page: 182>>>

Archives resources. Research visits to the Archives centers by graduate students, curators, and scholars totaled 2,760, and 730 rolls of microfilm were sent out on interlibrary loans to researchers in all parts of the country. Books, articles, exhibition catalogues, and dissertations are the concrete evidence of research in primary documentation. Among the more important recent ones acknowledging assistance from the Archives are full-length books on Rockwell Kent, William Sidney Mount, Eadweard Muybridge, Grant Wood, and on the Dada movement in New York; exhibition catalogues on Peggy Bacon, Jervis McEntee, and women artists of the 1930s; and dissertations on William Zorach and on the Stieglitz circle.
In a continuing effort to reach beyond the confines of pure scholarship to a broader audience, the Archives organized several exhibitions of documents from its holdings. “Artists and Models,” installed in the Archives Gallery made available by the National Portrait Gallery, opened in December. A traveling exhibition of letters, sketches, and photographs was shown in Dallas, San Francisco, and Cleveland through arrangements made by the Smithsonian National Associates Program, and other exhibitions were prepared in connection with Bicentennial art shows in San Francisco, Detroit, Cleveland, and Toledo. Press comments and public response to these efforts were extensive and enthusiastic.
Members of the Archives staff delivered thirty-five lectures and published eight articles and one exhibition catalogue during the year, a significant increase over similar activities in the past. They also participated in seven symposia devoted to professional and art historical subjects.
Editorial work on the Archives Bicentennial project, a threevolume bibliography of American art, was completed and a publication date in 1977 established. The Archives of American Art Journal, a quarterly publication containing articles based on Archives holdings, reports from the regional offices, and listings of recent acquisitions, continued its efforts to inform the scholarly community and provide a publishing medium for those actively engaged in research.
The Archives exists for the future as well as for the present, and later generations of scholars will expect to find here records that throw light on the art of our epoch. In meeting its responsibility to
172 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 183>>>

posterity the Archives regularly acquires collections whose significance and historical relevance will become clear only as time goes on. Such groups as the correspondence of David Smith and Alexander Calder are now of obvious importance, but early letters written by a then-obscure Andrew Wyeth at the outset of his career might well have been lost if his dealer, whose name is hardly known today, had not preserved them and eventually offered his gallery’s records to the Archives.
Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design
The Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Design, opens to the public on October 7, 1976, in the renovated Andrew Carnegie Mansion at 2 East 91st Street, New York City.
The Museum’s opening exhibition, ‘“Man Transforms,” has been designed by the architect and industrial designer Hans Hollein of Vienna, Austria, working with a team of international designers, including George Nelson, Richard Meier, and Buckminster Fuller of the United States, Ettore Sottsass of Italy, Oswald Ungers and Peter Bode of Germany, Arata Isosaki of Japan, Karl Schlamminger and Nadar Ardalan of Iran, and Murray Grigor of Scotland. The exhibition is being sponsored by the Johnson Wax Company.
A series of twenty satellite exhibits in different museums, libraries, and universities in New York City is scheduled to coincide with the opening. These exhibits, all drawn from the Cooper-Hewitt collections, will serve as a reminder to New York of the rebirth of one of the oldest of the city’s museums.
The Cooper-Hewitt’s drawings, prints, wallpapers, textiles, furniture, ceramics and glass, and library are being installed in new surroundings and will once again be available to the public for study.
The Museum is offering a full range of classes, workshops, lectures, weekend seminars, and tours for the autumn semester, beginning October 1976.
In cooperation with the Book-of-the-Month Club, the Museum is preparing a series of volumes on antiques, to appear in 1977.

Benefit auction in progress in the garden of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in May 1976. All objects sold had been donated for this occasion.
These volumes will deal primarily with the collections of the Cooper-Hewitt but will also refer to collections of other museums.
A third benefit auction was held in May in the Museum garden, and approximately $90,000 was raised from the sale of objects given specifically for the auction and from a dance that inaugurated the viewing. Several benefit lectures and small exhibitions were organized by the departments of drawings and textiles, and the proceeds from these events were contributed to special conservation and purchase funds.
A total of 633 works of art were received through donation, 19 were purchased, and 30 were transferred to the Museum; the Cooper-Hewitt participated in 37 exhibitions and transferred 1 work of art to the National Museum of History and Technology in Washington, D.C. and 4 to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
The Museum received major grants from the Johnson Wax Company, Karastan Rug Mills, Carnegie Corporation, Mr. Henry J. Heinz II, and support from the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Freer Gallery of Art
In observance of the American Bicentennial, the Freer Gallery of Art assembled, from its own collections, an exhibition entitled “The Arts of Asia at the Time of American Independence.” The exhibition and the fully illustrated catalogue were arranged in three sections: Arts of the Ch’ing Dynasty, 1644-1911; Arts of the Edo Period, 1615-1868; and Arts of the Near East and India. Objects in the exhibition were selected to provide insights into the civilizations of the Far East, the Near East, and India during the period of the American Revolution.
Another special exhibition was prepared for Her Majesty the Empress of Japan, who visited the Freer Gallery of Art on October 2, 1975. Her Majesty, who is an amateur artist, specifically asked to see a number of outstanding Japanese and Chinese objects in the Freer collection. The objects were placed on exhibition and were seen by Her Majesty during her visit. Her Majesty viewed another group of Far Eastern art objects in the study areas of the Gallery.
As part of an extensive conservation project—directed toward a forthcoming major exhibition of American paintings in the collection—that was begun during fiscal year 1975, a number of oil paintings have been cleaned, and gilt frames requiring repair are being restored.
Harold P. Stern, Director, completed a catalogue and book entitled Birds, Beasts, Blossoms and Bugs, the Nature of Japan. The volume was prepared for an exhibition selected and arranged by Dr. Stern at the Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Members of the curatorial staff contributed to the first volume of the Freer Gallery handbook series. The initial volume, devoted to a selection from the Chinese and Japanese collections, will be

followed by studies based on the Near Eastern and American collections. This first handbook, Masterpieces of Chinese and Japanese Art, was made possible by the generous financial support of the Weatherhead Foundation, Mr. Richard Weatherhead, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
In fiscal year 1975, the Collection acquired a number of important objects, gifts from Mr. Toyosaburo Taniguchi, Professor Franz Michael, Miss R. K. Keith, Mr. Gordon H. Brown, Mrs. Marion Hammer, Mr. John Thacher, Dr. Kurt Gitter, Mrs. Elizabeth Reynolds, and the Estate of Edith Ehrman. Mr. Taniguchi’s generous gift to the Study Collection consisted of ninety-five hanging scrolls by Japanese artist Takashima Hokkai (1850-1931). The scrolls are part of a suite of one hundred landscape paintings, entitled Hokkai Sansui Hyakushu. Mr. Taniguchi presented the paintings to the Freer Gallery in commemoration of the American Bicentennial. Secretary S. Dillon Ripley accepted the paintings from Mr. Taniguchi at a luncheon in the Gallery on April 20, 1976.
The Ellen Bayard Weedon Foundation again presented a generous gift to the Gallery for library acquisitions in the oriental field.
During the year, the Freer Gallery sponsored its twenty-third annual series of “Illustrated Lectures on Oriental Art.”
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
The first full year of operation of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden witnessed a continuation of public enthusiasm, as attendance equaled that of the inaugural year of 1974. In the less than two years since its opening, over three million people have visited the Museum.
This interest on the part of scholars, artists, collectors, and the general public has also been evidenced by many generous offers of works of art, from which the Museum has accepted 108 paintings, drawings, illustrated books, and sculptures. These gifts enable the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden to continue the policy of its Board of Trustees in expanding the existing collections. In addition to these gifts, the Hirshhorn Museum, as authorized by its Board of Trustees, also has purchased other works of art that

add depth to the collection and maintain the Museum’s interest in fine examples of contemporary creativity.
A meaningful celebration of the nation’s Bicentennial was a Museum priority in 1976. The combined efforts of the staff, guided by Curator Cynthia McCabe, produced the exhibition ““The Golden Door, Artist-Immigrants of America: 1876-1976,” a selective survey of the immigrant-artist’s contribution to the development and expansion of American culture. The comprehensive 432-page catalogue, which contains an introduction by Dr. Daniel Boorstin, Librarian of Congress, and an essay by Mrs. McCabe, includes detailed information about the exhibition’s content: 203 paintings, sculptures, architectural models, drawings, and photographs, representing 67 artists who immigrated to the United States from 23 countries. In addition, the catalogue includes a one-hundred-year

chronology of world events, immigration legislation, and cultural history, as well as artists’ biographies and their comments concerning the impact of immigration. A generous grant from The Thomas M. Evans Foundation, New York, made it possible to enlarge and enhance this significant catalogue.
Three orientation galleries, featuring pertinent immigration documents, ship lists, photographs, newspapers, and memorabilia, served to introduce visitors to the immigrant experience and were made possible by liberal support from The Balch Institute of Philadelphia. The Balch Institute also made it possible for the Museum to print and distribute 150,000 free tabloid-format information sheets about the exhibition.
Other exhibitions presented by the Museum were: “Soto: A

cially designed for use by sightless visitors to the Museum. The suggestion for the smaller version, which made it more accessible to the touch, came from various organizations for the blind and was approved by Mr. Calder and the General Services Administration. A braille plaque described the sculpture to the blind visitor. An official ceremony marked the unveiling at which Mrs. Gerald R. Ford; Mr. Arthur F. Sampson, Administrator, General Services Administration; and United States Senator Jennings Randolph (West Virginia) spoke before invited guests and a large audience.
Research on the permanent collections continued, with archival material being sorted, analyzed, and catalogued in a master file. Over one thousand photographs were added to these official files. The Museum answered 579 research inquiries from various sources and furnished 564 photographs to scholars, publishers, and authors. The Registrar’s office catalogued 400 works in the Museum collection (including 129 new acquisitions) and added newly gathered data to the computerized catalogue of the collection. A number of practical working tools were developed from this computer file,

including artist lists, donor lists, retrieval by type of object, storeroom inventory cards, and labels for photo archive files.
With its large collection of painting and sculpture, the Museum engages in an active program of lending to significant exhibitions here and abroad. Forty-two loans involving one hundred works were made from the Museum collection to other institutions. These loans included a portrait by Robert Delaunay sent to the Louvre, paintings by Willem de Kooning and Stuart Davis circulated to Rome, Bonn, and Eastern Europe, and other objects lent to major museums in London, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Another twenty-two paintings are on loan to the White House.
In addition to this regular program of outgoing loans, two exhibitions of works from the Museum collection were circulated:
“Sculptors and Their Drawings,” a selection of twelve sculptures and twelve related drawings, traveled to museums in Charlotte, San Francisco, Akron, and Middletown; an exhibition of twentyseven sculptures by Italian artists was made available to the Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
Seven temporary loan exhibitions and three smaller exhibitions, drawn from the Museum collection, were held during the year. These exhibitions included over 400 works borrowed from other museums and collections and 150 from the Museum’s own holdings.
The Education Department of the Museum continued to interpret the collection to a diverse public, which included many visitors from abroad during the Bicentennial year. The docent program continues to be the most popular educational service in the Museum, and one of the largest in the Washington metropolitan area. During the fifteen-month period from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976, 102 docents provided tours as follows:
Number Tour Classification of Tours Participants
Elementary School Group 168 7,942 children Secondary School Group 162 7,784 children Adult Group 245 7,656 adults General (unscheduled) 2,248 33,436 adults/children Special Exhibition 333 3,545 adults/children
Total 3,156 60,363 adults/children

<<<Page: 194>>>

The docents gave approximately ten thousand hours of volunteer time. To augment the summer schedule during the Bicentennial year, the Department trained five specialist-docents to interpret the Bicentennial exhibition “The Golden Door, Artist-Immigrants of America: 1876-1976.” These docents were especially useful during the Museum’s first evening visiting hours, when it was open until 9:00 p.m., April through Labor Day.
The Education Department developed a manual for Museum volunteers that is invaluable in the training and supervision of docents.
As part of the Museum’s changing exhibition program that began in September 1975, the Education Department prepared special one-page handouts for each exhibition, distributed without cost to visitors. Approximately sixty thousand copies of these handouts were distributed during the Soto, Nadelman, and Levine exhibitions.
In addition, the telesonic guide system, which serves to interpret selected paintings and sculptures in the permanent collection, was incorporated into the Bicentennial exhibition. Thirty-eight special tapes were created for this purpose.
The auditorium program, begun in November 1974, has continued with a weekly three-part film series and a monthly program of lectures. The film series features documentaries on art and artists, as well as avant-garde and experimental cinema and a special Saturday series featuring works in animation particularly selected for children. From September 1975 through April 1976, over 25,600 persons viewed 140 different films. Highlights of this film program included premieres of many new films, talks by artist-filmmakers, screening of works by sixteen independent filmmakers, and lectures on film as an art form.
The monthly lecture series featured distinguished professionals in the field of nineteenthand twentieth-century art. Among the speakers in this program were Michael Fried, Peter Plagens, Douglas Davis, John I. H. Baur, John Hallmark Neff, David Levine, and Diane Waldman. The eight lectures given during the year were attended by 1,242 persons.
The Museum’s intern program, begun last year, was continued during 1976. The graduate program included two interns who were working toward their master’s degree in art history at George

Washington University. The undergraduate program was also continued during the summer of 1976 and included four interns, who were selected from a total of 215 applicants from colleges throughout the United States.
The Photography Department concentrated on documenting the permanent collection and producing slides and photographs required for special exhibitions. Over 7,776 original photographs were produced by the Department through September 1976. The Department also answered 564 individual photo requests during the same period.
The Conservation Department made major advances toward completing its modern laboratory. Some three hundred objects were treated, twenty requiring major treatments. More than one hundred examination and condition reports were completed in connection with the ongoing project of surveying the entire collection. The collection of outdoor sculpture was cleaned and coated to help guard against harmful atmospheric conditions. With most of its equipment now installed, the laboratory is carrying on conservation activities essential to the physical care of the Museum collection.
The Department of Exhibits and Design mounted a total of four major and six smaller exhibitions. Shown were groupings of works

by David Smith, Henry Moore, Robert Rauschenberg, Jose de Creeft, and Ben Benn, as well as a selection of drawings from the permanent collection and of paintings by artists of the San Francisco area.
Major exhibitions installed by the Museum’s Department of Exhibits and Design included a retrospective of works by the Venezuelan artist Jesus Rafael Soto, which originated with The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and a retrospective of sculptures and drawings by Elie Nadelman, which was presented in cooperation with the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Museum’s exhibition of caricatures by David Levine will tour for two years under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. Especially relevant to the Smithsonian’s Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife was the exhibition of Thomas Hart Benton’s mural, The Sources of Country Music, which included preliminary drawings and was lent by the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum. An exhibition of Stoned Moon, a series of twenty-nine lithographs by Robert Rauschenberg, celebrated the opening of the new National Air and Space Museum.
Joseph Henry Papers
On February 6, 1976, ceremonies were held at Princeton University celebrating the publication of volume two of The Papers of Joseph Henry, released by the Smithsonian Institution Press in December 1975. Highlighting the activities at Princeton were the opening of an exhibit of Henry apparatus and documents, prepared in part by members of the staff of the Henry Papers, and a demonstration lecture reproducing Henry’s electromagnetic experiments, in which some of Henry’s original apparatus was used.
Volume two of The Papers of Joseph Henry is concerned with Henry’s first three years as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Princeton (1832-1835). Documented are his initial contacts with major European scientists, Henry’s struggles to improve the quality of the scientific program at Princeton, his continuing experimentation in terrestrial magnetism and self-induction, and his early association with Alexander Dallas Bache, later to become Henry’s

partner in remaking American science. Reading notes, personal and scientific correspondence, and detailed laboratory notes are included in the volume.
Research and editing for the third volume of The Papers of Joseph Henry have proceeded on schedule. Covering Henry’s career through mid—1838, this volume will document both his professional and personal life. The core of the volume will be Henry’s diary of his first European trip (1837). Henry observed European science, technology, and culture, and compared them to their American counterparts. The reader will view Europe through the eyes of Henry the scientist, exchanging ideas with colleagues, and Henry the tourist, awed by the sights of Europe.
The Henry Papers continues to participate in various scholarly and educational activities. The nineteenth-century seminar presented speakers from assorted divisions of the Institution. The editor, with financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation, organized a series of sessions on “The Sciences in America: A Bicentennial Retrospective,” at the 1976 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, under the sponsorship of the History of Science Society. This past year the Henry Papers again participated in the National Historical Publications Commission’s fellowship program in Advanced Editing of Documentary Sources for American History, training a postdoctoral fellow in the techniques of preparing documents for publication.
National Collection of Fine Arts
What has art meant to America and what has America meant to art? These questions were asked by one of the National Collection of Fine Arts’ major Bicentennial exhibitions, “America As Art.” Including 388 works of art, many never before shown in a major national presentation, the exhibition was organized in eight distinct parts, each examining an aspect of the relationship between America and its art and culture, from the late eighteenth century to the present. Themes ranged from ‘““America As Symbol” and “The American Cousin” to “Identity from Uniformity.” Accompanying

“America As Art” was a 320-page book of the same title by Joshua C. Taylor, with an additional essay by John Cawelti, an illustrated checklist, and a study manual.
Calling attention to more contemporary matters, ‘Signs of Life: Symbols in the American City,” an elaborately installed show at the Renwick Gallery, set out to explore the various levels of meaning in the environment we have built for ourselves. Candidly looking at “The Home,” “The Strip,” and “The Street” through photographs and full-scale mock-ups, “Signs of Life’ pointed out the human values underlying much that is overlooked in conscious efforts at environmental design. The exhibition, produced by the architectural firm of Venturi and Rauch, in close association with the staff, provoked wide discussion in the national press.
As a foundation for future work in the history of American art, on July 6 the National Collection of Fine Arts (NcFA) opened to the

scholarly public its Bicentennial Inventory of American Paintings Executed before 1914, an event marked by a small explanatory exhibition. This project was begun in 1971 to locate and record works from across the nation, with particular concern for those never before recorded. With the aid of individuals and local committees throughout the country, 153,000 paintings were filed on the computer by the time the Inventory was opened for use, and an image file recording 35,000 works was established. A guide to the Inventory, outlining its contents and describing its nature and use, was published in August. Since its opening, entries have continued to expand the Inventory’s listings, and scholars have been quick to utilize its information.
As a further Bicentennial contribution to the understanding of American art, the NcFA mounted the first comprehensive exhibition of works by the nineteenth-century painter Emanuel Leutze and published a catalogue raisonné of Leutze’s known works, compiled by Dr. Barbara Groseclose. The study revealed him to be a painter of great skill and national pride, who deserves to be remembered for more than his Washington Crossing the Delaware. Throughout the summer, “1876: American Art of the Centennial,” a small but representative exhibition of works actually shown, or similar to those exhibited in the art section of the Philadelphia exposition of 1876, provided an opportunity to look back at the complexities that characterized art in that important year. The exhibit was organized by Dr. Susan Hobbs.
In addition to exhibitions related to the Bicentennial celebration, the ncFA produced fourteen exhibits that continued its policy of investigating often neglected aspects or little studied assumptions of American art. The delightful and incisive work of Peggy Bacon, well known since the 1920s but sometimes overlooked by those more interested in the avant-garde, was presented by the Department of Prints and Drawings in an exhibition of 192 paintings, prints, drawings, and pastels. A 166-page publication, with an essay by Dr. Roberta Tarbell and a complete catalogue of Miss Bacon’s prints, accompanied the exhibition. In cooperation with the artist’s family, Janet Flint, Curator of Prints and Drawings, organized a major exhibition and catalogue of prints by Louis Lozowick, an artist of the 1920s and 1930s who in his theoretical writings and
History and Art / 189

<<<Page: 200>>>

works of art celebrated technology and the American city. Lozowick’s paintings were also featured in “Urban Optimism,” the section of ““America As Art” that dealt with the urban ideal of the Twenties. Mrs. Flint also organized an exhibition and wrote a critical essay on the contribution of George Miller, the master printer who almost single-handedly provided a generation of American artists with the technical expertise to produce lithographs of artistic quality. An especially provocative exhibition was that of the colorful works of Bob Thompson (1937-1966), organized by Adelyn Breeskin. Though cut off early in his career, Thompson made his mark as a distinctive personality in American art.
Of particular importance in the reassessment of recent art was “Sculpture: American Directions, 1945-1975,” assembled by Walter Hopps, which traveled to Dallas and New Orleans after its showing in Washington. Concentrating on variety in process and content, the exhibition provided a picture of the range and power of American sculpture over the past thirty years. “Images of an Era: The American Poster, 1945-1975,” an extensive exhibition prepared by

the Office of Exhibitions Abroad (o£a), was shown throughout the United States and has been sent abroad for extended tour. The exhibition is accompanied by a handsomely illustrated publication. Also originated under o£a were “Variations on the Camera’s Eye,” a selection of contemporary works that traveled through South America, and an exhibition of American quilts, shown in Europe. The impact of commercial and industrial design on our daily lives is rarely noted. In the Renwick Gallery’s retrospective exhibition of the designs of Raymond Loewy, the influence of one man’s sense of design was impressive. From the first streamlined locomotive to a recent oil company sign, Loewy taught a whole generation to see design in his special way. Of very different character were the designs of Arne Jacobsen, presented at the Renwick in an exhibition under the patronage of the Embassy of Denmark. In marked contrast to the works of these designers for industry were the works by American craftsmen featured in the Renwick’s exhibition, “Craft Multiples.” Each crafted object shown had to be producible in sets of at least ten without losing its individual quality. Accompanied
History and Art / 191

<<<Page: 202>>>

by a well-illustrated publication, the exhibit began a two-year tour of smaller cities in the United States after its Washington showing.
The public rarely has access to the operations that support the varied activities of the NcFA, so an exhibition, “Behind the Scenes,” was organized by interns working under the Department of Education to allow the visitor an insight into the organization and support necessary to care for works of art and to prepare carefully designed and documented exhibitions for the public. The creative process in developing a large-scale work was dramatically described in “. .. And There Was Light: Studies by Abraham Rattner for the Stained Glass Window, Chicago Loop Synagogue.” Both of these exhibitions were presented in the Education Department’s “Discover Gallery,” which is devoted to such informative and visually exciting exhibitions.
During the year, 507 works were added to the collection, including a luminous landscape painting by Thomas Doughty signed in 1833, and William Sonntag’s unusually dramatic Mountain Landscape of 1854. Among other important eighteenthand nineteenthcentury works acquired were the portrait of General Giles by Joseph Wright, Robert Loftin Newman’s Flight into Egypt, and Erastus Dow Palmer’s sculpture June. Several works were acquired that were featured in exhibitions, including Seymour Lipton’s sculpture The Defender, Bob Thompson’s Two Figures, and Louis Lozowick’s drawing Stage Setting for Gas. With matching funds from the National Endowment for the Arts, several major works were added to the collection of the Department of Prints and Drawings, including Jim Dine’s Five Paint Brushes, Robert Rauschenberg’s Treaty, and Claes Oldenberg’s Pile of Erasers. The Woodward Foundation made a generous gift of 193 contemporary works to the Collection.
Staff activity and participation in professional organizations have grown steadily over the years as the ncra has been increasingly looked to for leadership among those especially interested in American art. William Walker, Librarian of the National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery, was elected chairman of the Art Libraries Society of North America, and several staff members were elected to local art councils. Several members of the staff served as judges in competitions of national stature. The staff took an active part in the 71st Annual Conference of the American

Association of Museums. Among others, Val Lewton and David Keeler met with participants to explain the Ncra’s attitude toward the design of exhibitions, and association members were introduced to the methods used by the Education Department for improvisational tours and other, more general, uses of the collections that have come to be emulated in numerous museums throughout the nation. Staff members of the Conservation Laboratory, the Library, and the Bicentennial Inventory of American Paintings conducted tours and sessions. Robin Bolton-Smith, Associate Curator of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Painting and Sculpture, who organized a loan exhibition of early American miniatures in the ncFra’s Doris M. Magowen Gallery of Portrait Miniatures, delivered a lecture on American miniatures to the Sixth Annual Symposium on American Art. This event was co-sponsored by the ncra and the University of Delaware.
National Museum of History and Technology
The impressive commitment of the National Museum of History and Technology to mount nine exhibitions in honor of the nation’s Bicentennial reached a magnificent climax in fiscal year 1976, with the opening of five exhibitions, including two of unprecedented size: “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” and “A Nation of Nations.” Two others, “Suiting Everyone” and “We The People,” were opened last year and two, “Belgian Gunmaking in American History” and
“Person to Person,” remain to be opened in the final months of this calendar year. These varied and ambitious exhibitions culminate a period of more than six years of planning and preparation. During much of this time staff members redirected their activities, some in part and others totally, from their usual pursuits to an extraordinary concentration upon exhibition-related work. This mammoth endeavor resulted in nearly 125,000 square feet of exhibits in which over 38,000 objects are displayed.
The largest of all the exhibits is “1876: A Centennial Exhibition,” a recreation of the spirit of the great Philadelphia exposition of 1876, which occupied 274 acres and some 40 buildings in Fairmount Park. Using the entire exhibition area of 54,000 square feet in the Arts and Industries Building, this exhibit utilized more than
History and Art / 193

<<<Page: 204>>>

25,000 objects, some of them originally displayed at Philadelphia. Amid great enthusiasm, it was officially opened by Chief Justice Warren Burger and Secretary Ripley at twelve noon, May 10, the exact anniversary of the opening of the original exposition.
A large proportion of the staff contributed to this enormous effort. Designed by William A. Miner of the Museum’s Office of Exhibits, the exhibition catches the enthusiasm and ebullience of one hundred years ago. Robert Vogel, Chairman of the Department of Science and Technology, served as chairman of the curators who developed the content and collections. Robert C. Post, nmut Historian, served on the curatorial committee and as editor of the handsome publication produced for “1876: A Centennial Exhibition’”—a volume consisting of more than forty essays by members of the Museum staff and others, and almost 350 illustrations. Also accompanying the exhibit is a film planned for television presentation, as well as for viewing in the Smithsonian, entitled Celebrating a Century. This film vividly recreates the dream and achievements of a few Philadelphians who successfully carried the exposition through its many vicissitudes and made it a major event of the century. The script, written by Benjamin W. Lawless, Assistant Director for Exhibits, was produced by the Film Unit of Smithsonian Exhibits Central, under the direction of Karen Loveland. It was funded by the Museum and the National Science Foundation.
As in the original fair, machinery and technology dominate the present exhibit. Nearly all of the machines had to be restored and brought back to working condition. Several operating machine steam engines are set in motion regularly to run woodworking and metalworking machinery and an early Otis elevator. Indeed, motion highlights this exhibition. One display provides a selection of early powered fans, another a rotating lighthouse. A sparkling Baldwin locomotive and several carriages are featured, and many varieties of tools, implements, and scientific instruments appear, as well as inventions of the day ranging from the fluting iron to the telephone. From time to time, some of the musical instruments are demonstrated.
A sense of the foreign exhibits that were sent to Philadelphia is conveyed in the series of national pavilions, while the flavor of the states’ participation can be found in the individual bays presenting some of the states. One of the most notable presentations—dis-

plays, products, and efforts by women—is housed in a recreation of the separate building that was erected for that purpose in 1876. The dominant feature in the government wing of the exhibit is the 51-foot model of the U.S.S. Antietam. This model was actually displayed at Philadelphia and thereafter used at the Naval Academy for training in handling sailing ships. Restoration to its original appearance required a very tedious and time-consuming project of making, fitting, and rigging sails.
“A Nation of Nations,” an exhibition that made comparable demands upon the staff, was opened on June 9 after many years of planning and development. Occupying nearly half of the entire second floor of the Museum, the exhilarating story of the transfer of peoples and cultures to America is told in terms of objects. Throughout, items displayed are identified with the national and ethnic groups that used them.
The exhibit introduces the theme by showing evidences of the first migrants, the Indians, who themselves became a complex of nations, and by showing the remarkable diversity already present when the United States proclaimed its independence. Four major periods are developed: (1) the settling of the country by Englishspeaking peoples on the one hand and a great diversity of nations on the other; (2) the persistence of old patterns in the new land; (3) the sharing of experiences, in which new Americans participated in common efforts without giving up their own cultural heritage; and, finally (4) a nation among nations that lives in instant communication with the rest of the world.
The exhibit features fine examples of a great number of objects of everyday use and some very large items, among them a rotating windmill and a log gristmill from New Mexico powered by a horizontal waterwheel. Several striking interiors include an early New England kitchen, an early twentieth-century urban school room, a World War II barracks, and a twentieth-century ItalianAmerican home. An operating pencilmaking machine and an operating amateur radio station in actual contact with the rest of the world are demonstrated periodically.
This exhibition was planned and developed by a committee of staff members under the leadership of Carl H. Scheele, Curator of Postal History; throughout preparation, the resources of the entire Museum were crucial. The design was by Chermayeff and

One of the smaller exhibitions, “American Banking,” was made possible by the support of the American Banking Association. It represents the first major attempt in the museum world to illustrate
the story of American banking and credit and related services from the nation’s beginning to the present. A supplemental history of the American banking system, entitled American Banking, was written by the Curators of Numismatics, Elvira and Vladimir Clain-Stefanelli, who also had planned the exhibition.
Two other exhibits, although small, are especially notable in bringing to this country for the first time great treasures held in other nations. ‘Columbus and His Time” presented many of the

The exhibition “Columbus and His Time,” which opened June 3, 1976, con-
tained many treasures and rare documents from Spain relating to Columbus. Especially notable was the great map drawn in 1500 on oxhide by Juan de la Cosa, navigator, geographer, and master of the Santa Maria on Columbus’s first voyage.
state documents and relics relating to Christopher Columbus and his voyages of discovery. Carried through by Silvio A. Bedini, Deputy Director of the Museum, the project necessitated his on-site search of repositories throughout Spain, where most of the objects had remained for as long as five hundred years. Securing the necessary loan agreements for a number of these materials required a heroic effort coordinated by the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica in Madrid, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Relations, and the personal intercession, again and again, of King Juan Carlos himself. Perhaps the most spectacular of the treasures is the great map of Juan de la Cosa, produced in 1500, in which the new world discovered by Columbus was delineated for the first time. Critical documents relating to the voyage, weapons and armor of the period, and even books with Columbus’s own notes are included. Portraits of Columbus and Queen Isabella and the great retablo of the Virgin Protectress of Seafarers from the Reales Alcazares in Seville are remarkable pieces. The exhibit was opened formally by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia on their visit to Washington, June 3, 1976.
The visit to the Smithsonian by Queen Elizabeth II was commemorated by a smaller, jewellike display of twenty-five of the

original anatomical drawings by Leonardo da Vinci from the Queen’s personal collection in Windsor Castle. Because the drawings had been bound into volumes, this was the first time they could be viewed side by side in context with one another. Although displayed for only one month, the exhibition drew scholars and students of medicine, anatomy, and painting from all over the country. It was opened on July 2, 1976, by Sir Robin MackworthYoung, Royal Librarian and Keeper of the Queen’s Archives.
The Museum’s public presentations were not limited to exhibitions. The Division of Musical Instruments produced two record-

ings with instruments from the National Collections. Music From the Age of Jefferson has proven to be extremely popular and a recording of Volume II of the Songs of Stephen Foster has also received acclaim. James M. Weaver, Associate Curator of the Division, prepared the musicians for thirteen live performances of “Music and Dance from the Age of Jefferson,” produced in various parts of the country in cooperation with the National Smithsonian Associates.
Despite the diversion of most of the Museum’s staff and resources to exhibition projects, the collections were enriched by the acquisition of numerous important specimens, some acquired specifically for the major exhibitions and others added to the reference collections. Worthy of particular mention are the only extant prototype of a “Geiger-Miiller” radiation counter tube; the first hand calculator; the “Huff-Duff,” the radio direction-finder that broke the wolf packs of German submarines in World War II; and a major collection of radiological artifacts and documents. Also acquired were a comprehensive collection of nineteenth-century American stoneware; a rare inlaid Pennsylvania German chest dated 1783; a Massachusetts “Sword in Hand” 30-shilling note of 1775 printed from plates engraved by Paul Revere; and the Ernst W. Puttkammer Collection of more than 150,000 German and German-

related stamps and the René Miiller Collection of Saar overprints. Additions to the ordnance collections included a rare seventeenthcentury dog lock long-fowler of the type used by New Englanders and the only known example of the repeating rifle made on the patent of Joseph G. Chambers during the War of 1812. A one-tenthscale model of the eighteenth-century tobacco ship Brilliant was donated by the American Tobacco Institute and will be featured in the Hall of American Maritime Enterprise now being planned.
Most notable among acquisitions important for their associations were a dress from the First Lady, Mrs. Gerald R. Ford; a campstool from George Washington’s field headquarters tent; and jewelry and sewing accessories owned by Martha Washington. A tall case clock was acquired, made by Peter Hill, the first black clockmaker in this country. Herbert R. Collins, Associate Curator in the Division of Political History, attended both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and collected valuable ephemera and political campaigning memorabilia for the already outstanding collection owned by the Museum.

The Museum engaged in a wide variety of educational activities. These ranged from the direct (though often unperceived) impact of exhibits, through the programs of the Division of Visitor Information and Education, to formal activities in higher education and informal participation in the work of many professional groups.
The Division of Visitor Information and Education offered more services than ever before. During the school year (October 1975— April 1976), 187 docents conducted 1,620 lesson-tours related to several themes for 31,859 students and visitors, 289 outreach programs in local schools serving 8,734 children, and 759 tailored and highlight tours for 15,561 adult visitors. In addition, 795 special programs, including tours for the handicapped, “discovery corners,” demonstrations, and films were presented to 13,123 visitors. During the other months covered in this fifteen-month reporting period (July 1975 through September 1976), 69,959 visitors participated in 2,290 mini-tours, demonstrations, ““discovery corners,” and specially scheduled programs.
In August 1975, Joseph Buckley joined the staff to develop and implement a program for handicapped visitors. Among current activities are signed tours for the deaf, outreach programs for the mentally retarded, adapted tours for the physically handicapped, and arranged tours for the elderly. More extensive use of touchable objects and raised-line drawings has increased the Museum’s accessibility to the blind. The installation of special communications equipment has enabled the Special Education Specialist to deal directly with handicapped individuals and agencies for the handicapped.
For the most part, new tours were developed around the Bicentennial exhibitions or the new exhibitions were included in existing tours; “1876: A Centennial Exhibition’’ added a new dimension to museum education at the Smithsonian. Docents, clothed in period costumes, use “living history” techniques to present the various items in the exhibit. As “salesmen” for the display, the docents not only demonstrate various objects in such areas as W. and L. E. Gurley surveying instruments and Snediker and Carr ventilating fans, but also discuss the daily affairs of 1876 with visitors.
The “discovery corners” represent another addition to the educational programs. The Spirit of 1776 Corner opened in April 1976. Its popularity led to the addition of a “discovery corner” in the

Hall of Electricity in May 1976, presenting the early electrical experiments of Benjamin Franklin.
The Bicentennial series of Frank Nelson Doubleday lectures was dedicated to “The Character of the American Achievement.” David C. Mathews, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, spoke on “Perspectives on Education.” Harold Rosenberg, art critic of The New Yorker, examined “American Art: Form and Exploration.” Thomas C. Cochran, Benjamin Franklin Professor Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, evaluated “The American Business Heritage,” and author Stephen Birmingham concluded with “Ethnicity in America.”
The Museum’s largest formal commitment to higher education has been through the Smithsonian Fellowship Program. The seven fellows appointed during the 1975 academic year reflected, even more than usual, the great diversity of its pursuits and interests. This year only one was a postdoctoral fellow: Arthur Nunes of the University of California, who pursued research in the history of welding. The predoctoral fellows were: Virginia Drachmann, State University of New York at Buffalo, whose topic was nineteenthcentury obstetrical and gynecological instruments; Leonard Reich, Johns Hopkins University, the development of the vacuum tube and radio in the United States; Scott Hambly, University of Pennsylvania, developments in the form, use, and function of the mandolin in the United States; Richard Glasow, University of Delaware, the “new American navy,” naval officers, and naval engineering; Robert Friedel, Johns Hopkins University, a study of the technical and social history of celluloid; and Susan Frey, University of Washington, a study of Friedrich Engels, the Dialectics of Nature, and nineteenth-century science. Limited-term summer appointments were served by Julie Haifley, George Washington University, whose subject was Titian Ramsay Peale and photography; and Steven Dick, Indiana University, who studied astronomical measuring instruments. The Fellowship Program continued to add a significant dimension to activities at the National Museum of History and Technology, especially as liaison between the Museum and academia. Biweekly fellows’ luncheons provided a productive medium for interaction with the staff.
Under the direction of Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research has been active in

directing fellows, in research activities, and ina variety of professional programs. Colonel Thomas E. Griess, Chairman of the History Department at West Point, served as a fellow in the 1975-1976 academic year. This summer, Colonel Alfred F. Hurley, usar, and Hans L. Paeffgen arrived to pursue individual research projects as fellows.
The Institute co-sponsored with the United States Commission on Military History, the Ninth Quinquennial Conference of the Commission Internationale d’Histoire Militaire, which was held in the Museum in August 1975. Approximately one hundred and sixty historians attended, including sixty from twenty-six foreign nations; simultaneous translation of the proceeding was provided. Two related themes were considered: ‘‘Development of Military Techniques and Technology: Its Impact on Strategy and Tactics in the Period Before the Atomic Bomb,” and “The Age of Revolution in the Americas During the 18th and 19th Centuries: The Military Impact on Society, Economics, and Technology.” Dr. Philip K. Lundeberg, Curator of Naval History, served as program chairman.
In November 1975, at the General Douglas MacArthur Memorial Library, Norfolk, Virginia, Dr. Pogue participated in the first of a three-part series of seminars on the American military occupation and reconstruction of Japan and Europe after World War II. The second part took place in April at the George C. Marshall Research Foundation and the third will meet here in May 1977. In March 1976, Dr. Pogue and Colonel Griess contributed military history dimensions to a television series entitled ‘“Transformations of American Society,” presented by Bergen Community College and the Columbia Broadcasting System. Dr. Pogue served as consultant in developing the George C. Marshall Corridor at the Pentagon, opened by President Ford in April. Also in April, Dr. Pogue joined the executive committee that will supervise the large, statewide program of the Kentucky Bicentennial Oral History Commission.
In January 1976, at the request, among others, of Dr. Robert R. Kifer, Marine Sanctuaries Coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), U. S. Department of Commerce, the Eisenhower Institute sponsored a meeting in the Museum of representatives of interested public and private groups to assist NOAA in developing a philosophical basis for its management of the recently created Monitor Marine Sanctuary. The sanc-

tuary is centered upon the wreck of the U.S.S. Monitor off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. With Dr. Pogue as chairman, the group endorsed the establishment of an advisory panel to the United States Department of Commerce, to aid in establishing requirements for research permits and policy on the recovery of Monitor artifacts.
In much of the Museum, Bicentennial exhibit commitments held research activities to a lower level than usual. There were, however, a few exceptions: Robert P. Multhauf, Senior Historian, spent much of the year in Munich and other European centers working on his history of nonmetallic minerals; Sami K. Hamarneh, Historian of Pharmacy, examined archival material in Egypt during the summer of 1975; Uta C. Merzbach, Curator of Mathematics, worked on the history of mathematics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Under a Smithsonian Research Foundation grant, Cynthia Hoover, Curator of Musical Instruments, researched collections in many parts of the country pertinent to a study of music in eighteenth-century American life. John H. White, Curator of Transportation, completed a massive history of the railroad passenger car, which was accepted for publication by the Johns Hopkins University Press.
Among the more important publications that appeared during the past year was Thinkers and Tinkers, by Silvio A. Bedini, which dealt with science and technology in colonial America. Robert P. Multhauf, who edits Isis, supervised two anthologies from Isis, one edited by Brooke Hindle and entitled Early American Science; the other edited by Otto Mayr and entitled Philosophers and Machines. Staff members were especially prominent as authors in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography, two volumes appearing during the year. Twenty-two contributions to the Dictionary came from the Museum.
In a variety of research and professional activities, the Museum reached out to other communities. The restoration of the Mexico City Cathedral’s two eighteenth-century organs was initiated this year by Smithsonian Collaborator D. A. Flentrop. Damaged by fire and considered beyond repair by the church authorities, these instruments were central to the efforts of John Fesperman, Curator of Musical Instruments, and Scott Odell, Conservator, to stimulate interest in a restoration program for a number of historic Spanish

colonial instruments that remain neglected. Work was also begun on a smaller eighteenth-century organ in Taxco, Mexico, as a joint effort of the Division of Musical Instruments, Collaborator Charles Fisk, and the Mexican National Patrimony Restoration Department.
In September 1975, Curator of the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering Robert M. Vogel was one of the delegates from the United States to the Second International Congress on the Conservation of Industrial Monuments, where he delivered a paper on “The Preservation of Industrial Monuments in the United States.”
Dr. Sami K. Hamarneh, Historian of Pharmacy, participated in the International Symposium for the History of Arabic Science held at the University of Aleppo in April. He has been appointed editor of the newly established Journal for the History of Arabic Science, to be published in Syria. The Division of Postal History and Philately participated in the Seventh Annual Stamp Exhibition held in May at Philadelphia and was host to the annual congress of the Fédération Internationale de Philatélie at the Museum in May.
Among the more important meetings of research scholars held in the National Museum of History and Technology was the Society for the History of Technology’s eighteenth annual meeting, a special Bicentennial conference on “Two Hundred Years of American Technology,” which met in October 1975. Major papers were presented by leading historians of technology. With more than one hundred and fifty registrants, everyone concerned considered the meeting an unprecedented success. Dr. Melvin Kranzberg, long-time Secretary of the Society, later remarked that ““every part of the meeting turned out so successfully that we will be hard pressed to repeat this exhilarating event in the future.”
In May 1976, the Museum was host to the Eighth Annual Meeting of the International Society for the History of the Behavioral and Social Sciences (cHEIRON). Reflecting this organization’s multidisciplinary orientation, the program included sessions ranging from social psychology to anthropology and unwritten historical sources. The program was arranged by Audrey B. Davis, Curator of Medical Sciences, and planned by Michael M. Sokal, of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, formerly a Smithsonian fellow.
In October 1975, in conjunction with the Haydn Festival and Conference held in Washington, several concerts were presented in the Museum’s Hall of Musical Instruments. In November, at the

call of Chairman John Nicholas Brown, the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board met to counsel the Museum on the display of artifacts from the armed forces. In June 1976, during the annual meeting of the American Association of Museums in Washington, a session was held in the National Museum of History and Technology on “Collecting in the 21st Century.” And in September, during the Washington meetings of the American Psychological Association, the Society for Engineering Psychologists held a session in Carmichael Auditorium on ‘Perspectives on Technology and Americans.”
The Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology, installed in temporary quarters within the Museum, will be opened in October 1976. This rare-book library includes all the classics in the history of science and represents a great research resource.
National Portrait Gallery
In terms of special exhibitions, the past year has been a particularly active one for the National Portrait Gallery. “Portraits From The Americans: The Democratic Experience,” based on Daniel J. Boorstin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book, opened in November on the newly renovated third floor of the Gallery. This area has now been restored to the American Victorian Renaissance style in which it had been decorated in the 1880s following a fire in 1877 in the north and west wings of the building. “The Americans” was accompanied by a catalogue, illustrated with portraits and other related materials, and a text, supplementing that by Dr. Boorstin, written by Messrs. Beard, Voss, and Yellis of the Gallery’s staff. The Gallery’s final Bicentennial exhibition, ““Abroad in America: Visitors to the New Nation, 1776-1914,” opened in April. It was organized by Marc Pachter, Historian of the Gallery, who also wrote the introduction for the accompanying publication, which consisted of twenty-nine essays by foreign and American scholars and writers. This volume was co-edited by Mr. Pachter and Mrs. Frances Wein, the National Portrait Gallery’s editor.
Six other exhibitions deserve note: “Christian Gullager, Portrait Painter to Federal America,” opened by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark on May 11; “Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir, Director of the Gallery Marvin Sadik, and Secretary S. Dillon Ripley at the luncheon held for the presentation of the Raphael Soyer portrait of Mrs. Meir.
A special presentation of a portrait of Golda Meir by Raphael Soyer, the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Cummings, Mr. and Mrs. Meyer P. Potamkin, and the Charles E. Smith Family Foundation, took place on December 19. The event was attended by Mrs. Meir and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, both of whom spoke. Another special presentation, a portrait bust of Henry A. Wallace by Jo Davidson, was made on January 20, the thirty-fifth anniversary of Wallace’s inauguration as Vice President. The bust was the gift of the subject’s children, who were present at the ceremony, which was also attended by Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Acquisitions during the past year included forty-four portraits by purchase and twenty-three by gift. Outstanding in the former category are splendid paintings of John Adams by John Trumbull,

Lee, done at Petersburg during the winter of 1864-1865 by Edward Caledon Bruce; a 1932-portrait of Amelia Earhart by Edith Scott; and James Sharples’s exceptional pastel of George Washington, which had descended in Washington’s family. Especially noteworthy among the portraits given the Gallery were an extremely rare mezzotint, in an extraordinary state of preservation, of Samuel Adams by Samuel Okey, a gift of Mrs. Katie Louchheim and Mr. William Louchheim; a charcoal drawing of James Russell Lowell by Samuel W. Rowse, presented by Miss Susan Norton; a striking daguerreotype of Thomas Cole, given by a descendant of the subject, Mrs. Edith Cole Silberstein; and an early self-portrait by Thomas Hart Benton, the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Jack H. Mooney.
Of great future significance to the Gallery was the enactment in February 1976 of Public Law 94209, which authorizes the collection and exhibition of portrait photographs.

Office of Academic Studies
A major unifying theme of the Smithsonian’s diverse activities is intellectual accomplishment based on professional research and the free interplay of ideas. Essential to the achievement of intellectual excellence are deep and complex ties with the national and international academic communities. Smithsonian academic programs offer a context for the Institution’s entire research faculty to collaborate with colleagues in the Smithsonian and in the larger academic world in the pursuit of knowledge. The benefits of collaborative efforts flow both ways: they stimulate and refresh analysis and interpretation by Smithsonian staff members and foster the diffusion of their findings. Because the most exciting intellectual interplay takes place face to face, the Smithsonian’s academic programs bring people together on either a one-to-one basis or in small groups.
With policy direction from the Board of Academic Studies, the

Office of Academic Studies acts as the center through which the Smithsonian’s research activities pursue their academic objectives. Academic programs reflect the character of the research and collection strengths of the Smithsonian. They deliberately avoid duplication of university-based study and research, stressing new perspectives on academic subjects and disciplines not commonly studied in the university. These academic programs are typically residential and range from experimental undergraduate studies to traditional postdoctoral research-training fellowships. They are flexible, giving assistance to individuals who need to study at the Institution for a few days and to persons who require the research resources of the Institution for a year or more. Most scholars come to the Smithsonian to pursue academic studies in an individual working relationship with a member of the research staff. Where an expanded dialogue seems promising, however, small seminars and symposia are developed which assemble colleagues from around the world.
During the 1975-1976 academic year, special attention was directed to meeting new demands on academic programs within the constraint of limited funding. For the most part, these demands stemmed from the greater participation of staff members in academic activities, from the addition of new professional staff members throughout the Smithsonian Institution, and from the addition of new research activities—most notably the recently opened Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the National Air and Space Museum. Additional support for fellowships and other student appointments was developed by the further integration of academic appointments into the major objectives of each of the Smithsonian Institution’s bureaus and facilities.
Resulting from this effort were a substantial increase in the number of fellows and students in residence at the Smithsonian Institution; an extended and improved interchange among staff members and students, at many levels; and a further diversification of the types of academic programs offered. For example: the first fellow was appointed at the Hirshhorn Museum; three new predoctoral fellowships for field research were created in conjunction with the Smithsonian International Environmental Program; two new professional internships were created, one in exotic animal medicine at the National Zoological Park, the other in anthropological
212 / Smithsonian Year 1976

archival and publication work at the Center for the Study of Man; and Smithsonian staff helped develop and participated in the new Washington Cultural Semester program of The American University.
To assist in the management of academic programs, the Office of Academic Studies increased its efforts to draw upon the experience of fellows and students during their residence at the Smithsonian Institution. Their evaluations have proved a useful tool for program management and development. They have also expressed the almost universal conviction that the academic experience at the Smithsonian Institution was crucial in the professional lives of the participants.
Under the Smithsonian’s Fellowship Program, individuals spend a year consulting the collections and conducting research at the Institution. Predoctoral fellows complete their dissertations with direction from Smithsonian Institution staff members. Postdoctoral fellows pursue advanced research training, working in close collaboration with a Smithsonian adviser. In the academic year 1975— 1976 fifty-seven fellows were appointed to study in the museums, archives, and research stations of the Institution.
To assist students in determining the scope of their anticipated research at the start of their graduate training, a Visiting Research Student Program offers the opportunity to spend ten weeks pursuing a research topic at the Institution. This year, thirty Visiting Research Students were appointed.
Increasingly, colleges and universities are offering their students the opportunity to study off-campus and receive academic credit. The value of supplementing classroom experience with work experience in related disciplines has now gained national recognition. These nontraditional work and study assignments are individually developed for each student, to profit both the student and the Smithsonian. Under this program of Museum Study, seventeen students were appointed last year.
Many investigators express a need to spend periods of a week or two consulting with the staff and collections. These visitors bring to the Institution’s faculty the welcome opportunity to maintain a regular exchange with colleagues from around the world. To encourage and facilitate such visits, the Smithsonian conducts a Short

Term Visitor and Seminar Program, under which thirty individual investigators and three staff-developed seminars were supported this year.
During the 1975-1976 academic year, some one hundred and fifty individuals participated in a program of academic study at the Smithsonian. Brief descriptions of their research and study may be found in Appendix 7.
Office of American Studies
The Office of American Studies continued its program in graduate education throughout the year. The Fall 1975 Seminar in the ‘Material Aspects of American Civilization” had as its theme leisure and recreation in American culture. Taught by the Director of the program and Professor Bernard Mergen of The George Washington University, the course had twenty-five students.
Other seminars given during the academic year 1975-1976 included: “Introduction to the Systematic Study of Vernacular Building,” taught by Cary Carson, Coordinator of Research of the St. Mary’s City (Maryland) Commission; “The American Decorative Arts in Historic Preservation,” taught by Barbara Carson; “The Material Culture of Alexandria, Virginia: 1770-1830,” taught by Dennis O’Toole, Curator of Education of the National Portrait Gallery; “The Art and Architecture of Washington, D. C.: 1791— 1929” taught by Michael Richmond, Project Director for the National Trust for Historic Preservation; and the 1975 summer course in “Material Aspects of American Civilization: An Introduc” taught by Joanna Zangrando of The George Washington University.
During the summer of 1976, David Van Tassel taught the “Introduction to Material Aspects of American Civilization.”

Jointly sponsored by the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the Smithsonian Institution, the exhibition received the ‘Outstanding Bicentennial Planning Award” of the National Capital Area Chapter, American Institute of Planners.
From September 2-9, 1976, the Director attended the Fortysecond International Congress of Americanists in Paris, France, and delivered a paper on “Economic Development of the Arctic: Future of Eskimo and Indian People in the Historical Context of the ‘Lower 48’ States.”

Smithsonian Year + 1976 MUSEUM PROGRAMS
THE MEASURE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS of an organization is its ability to face frenetic pressure and impossible deadlines while maintaining quality in performance, equanimity in attitude, and timeliness in delivery. With no fear of immodesty one can say that the Smithsonian Institution has amply demonstrated its effectiveness in this Bicentennial year, when the projects that had been in preparation for nearly a decade climaxed with the opening of the National Air and Space Museum and in a wide variety of complex exhibits and other cultural activities in all of our museums. That so much was accomplished is a tribute to the management of these museums and to the dedication of their staffs.
In these multiple activities, the units that are part of the Office of Museum Programs played varied roles. Many had to put aside some of their more traditional pursuits to assist in meeting deadlines, while others found in the Bicentennial the fulfillment of their purpose.
The satisfaction of having contributed to the success of the Bicentennial celebration has prepared us to face many tasks left unfinished and whose urgency is becoming apparent.
The vital role that museums play in preserving, interpreting, and transmitting America’s heritage is being more clearly recognized. Museums are now conscious that their responsibilities transcend narrow or disciplinary boundaries. They provide that sense of historical continuity and interrelationship that is so necessary if we are to understand the world around us and our role within it. These considerations are forcing museums to improve the quality of their performance. This dedication to improvement characterizes the rich

and varied complex that constitutes the museum functions of the Institution.
In the years ahead we must seek new ways to interpret our collections to the public, integrate our offerings within the academic tradition, and find new ways to employ our holdings as instruments of continuing education and self education.
To achieve these ends, we must develop our capability of sharing the resources of the Institution through traveling exhibitions, audiovisual devices, television, and publications. We must refine the format of exhibitions, taking advantage of the unique multidisciplinary opportunities offered by the variety in our collections and museums.
The training of conservators, the perfecting of conservation methods, and the scientific examination of processes and structures must be encouraged. The advances made by contemporary science

can be put to greater use in interpreting the past products of man’s creativity and ingenuity. Our own effort in conservation must be expanded, as it must be by other museums across the nation.
Data retrieval from our vast holdings must be perfected. Though too much should not be expected from computers, the fullest use of computer technology has not yet been made.
The usefulness of vast reserve collections, which are vital for study and which present, in many cases, irreplaceable testimony of the evolution and continuity of the natural world, must be enhanced through better retrieval methods and especially through the development of storage and study facilities whose absence, in some cases, is now jeopardizing the safety of this heritage or preventing its full use. In all of these areas, the units of the Office of Museum Programs play a key role, often unglamorous because supportive, but rewarding because necessary.

The completion of the National Air and Space Museum led to the opening of a new, revitalized branch library, located in elegant new quarters, whose holdings were almost totally catalogued. Cataloguing was accomplished in part through the Central Library’s continued efforts to improve acquisition and cataloguing processes and make greater use of the cataloguing capabilities of the Ohio College Library Center (octc). The institution was one of the first members of octc, which links research and public libraries throughout the eastern United States by a computer network that permits the sharing of resources and, to a great extent, eliminates duplication of effort. In cooperation with the National Museum of History and Technology, the Libraries also completed the transfer of the great manuscript and rare book collections donated by Dr. Bern Dibner, housed in newly completed temporary quarters.
The Conservation Analytical Laboratory, reinstalled in an expanded space, was able to provide new analytical services through greatly improved equipment and a slightly enlarged staff. The Laboratory concentrated the major part of its efforts on assisting numerous curatorial departments in preparing objects for complex exhibitions such as “A Nation of Nations” and “1876.” In spite of the day-to-day needs of exhibit curators, preparators, and others, the staff contributions to scholarly literature and participation in professional meetings continued at a high level. A series of seminars has been developed in cooperation with the National Bureau of Standards that will bring together curators, scientists, archeologists, and anthropologists to focus their disciplines on common problems. Further effort will be made in the coming years to study manufacturing methods and materials so as to gain a better understanding of technological growth and refine conservation methods.
The Archives of the Institution, keeper of the Institution’s historical “conscience,” is an invaluable research tool, not only for the history of the Institution but for the history of science and scholarship in the United States. The Archives has continued to classify and analyze hundreds of thousands of documents and to develop means for their easier retrieval. The Archives also completed its long-planned move from the Smithsonian Institution Building to larger quarters in the Arts and Industries Building. The oral archives program was expanded, and senior members of the staff have recorded new data essential for an understanding of the Institu-

tion’s growth, as well as of the growth of the interviewees’ own disciplines.
The long-planned reorganization of the Office of the Registrar was completed during the year. Each of the museums of the Institution now has its own registrarial department, which will permit far better coordination than was possible in the past between registrarial and curatorial functions. The Office of the Registrar remains a central coordinating-planning unit, responsible for assisting the development of retrieval systems for the Institution. In time it may become a key element in regional or national networks. The Registrar was made chairman of a pan-institutional Collections Management and Policy Committee whose function is to review current practices and make recommendations for future development, with the aims of avoiding duplication, identifying needs, and maximizing the use of resources. The work of the Committee is closely linked with the development of plans for a proposed Museum Support Center.
Perhaps the unit in greatest demand was the Office of Exhibits Central, which provided specialized production support for the exhibit units of each museum. This Office was also responsible for a major exhibition loaned by the Japanese Imperial Household and another that was loaned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths of London and shown in the Smithsonian Institution Building.
In late spring and early summer, a major effort was made to meet the special requirements of the Festival of American Folklife. Its unprecedented length and complexity presented entirely new problems for the Division of Performing Arts, as well as for those units called upon to give support.
The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (siTEs) circulated 210 exhibitions around the country, and, through an imaginative program co-sponsored by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration, brought to the United States an important series of exhibitions sponsored by foreign nations and sent to our country in tribute to our Bicentennial. These exhibitions, and some that are still being organized, provide a unique opportunity for museums, historical societies, colleges, and other organizations throughout the United States to show facets of foreign cultures far more directly than they could by other means. Approximately eight million people benefited from sires offerings in 1976. As in the past,

a major part of the costs of organizing and circulating sites exhibitions was provided by grants, contracts, gifts, and modest receipts from rental fees.
During the year, the Horticultural Services Division became the responsibility of the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs and was renamed the Office of Horticulture. This change signifies a new direction for that department. From being a support unit, it will become an initiator in interpreting the history of horticulture, interrelating materials that have visual appeal as well as scholarly logic. The most impressive result of this new approach is the horticultural treatment of the interior of the Arts and Industries Building. Working with the curatorial staff of the National Museum of History and Technology, the Office created a widely acclaimed evocation of the great horticultural extravaganza of the Philadelphia Centennial. The Office also took a leading part in developing the Victorian Garden in the South Yard of the Smithsonian Institution Building, that extends the spirit of the “1876” exhibition and provides a setting that emphasizes the architectural beauty and character of the Smithsonian Institution and Arts and Industries buildings.
The National Museum Act, administered by the Institution, was reauthorized for three more years, testifying to the quality of a grant program that since its inception has provided aid to the museum profession. The Act has encouraged the development of expertise in museum work, enhancing opportunities for the training of existing personnel as well as younger persons who, in increasingly large numbers, are attracted to the museum field. Through grants from the National Museum Act, the National Conservation Advisory Council has continued its in-depth analysis of the conservation needs of the country and published the first of a series of comprehensive reports.
Seminars, workshops, and internships, as well as research in specific aspects of museum management, were all made possible by National Museum Act grants that went to a wide variety of individuals and organizations. As in the past, special efforts were made to avoid duplication of the programs that are administered by the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The Office of Museum Programs has continued to develop and
222 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 233>>>

refine a series of video-tape and slide programs on various aspects of conservation. These programs are now available for national distribution. Workshops on various aspects of museum management, using the knowledge of Smithsonian staff members and invited specialists, have increased in number and have attracted colleagues from all parts of the country. This program will be developed further in the coming year.
The long-recognized need of Native Americans for expertise that would enable them to protect their heritage and develop their own museum collections and interpretive programs is now nearer to being met. Final arrangements were made to develop a training program that takes full advantage of the specialized talents of Smithsonian staff members. The aim of this program is to provide Native Americans with the skills necessary to run their own museums in a fully professional manner.
Conservation-Analytical Laboratory
The Conservation Analytical Laboratory (cAL) serves as the central research organization of the Institution in a wide variety of conservation-related fields. It possesses complex instruments permitting spectrographic, X-ray thermoluminescence analysis as well as the more traditional equipment related to standard chemical methods. Recently it added X-ray fluorescence equipment matched to computer capabilities and is rapidly developing a computerized information system.
The reconstruction of Laboratory space, initiated in 1974, was completed during the year.
The Laboratory has embarked on a joint program with the National Bureau of Standards to develop a series of seminars on science applied to museum artifacts. These seminars, intended to bring together anthropologists, archeologists, and scientists to discuss subjects of common interest, may lead to joint research projects.
A major function of cat is to disseminate information to members of the staff of the Institution as well as to others concerned with the vital problems of conservation; to facilitate this, in cooperation with the Conservation Information Program, a videotape series of eighty conservation orientation lectures was com-

pleted and is now available in-house as well as to museums and other organizations across the country. The main role of the laboratory, however, is to provide technical interpretation and chemical analysis on a wide variety of items. During the year, these ranged from the original stenciling of the Arts and Industries Building, which was discovered under numerous layers of later paint, to the identification of the gum varnish which was applied by John Henry Belter to furniture that he had assembled in 1858.
The Laboratory monitored temperature and humidity conditions in a large number of locations and was responsible for developing proper environmental controls for the objects loaned by the Japanese Imperial Household and displayed in the Smithsonian Institution Building between September 18 and October 5, 1975.
The staff was especially pressed to meet the deadlines imposed by a large number of Bicentennial exhibitions. In spite of this, numerous contributions to scholarly research were made during the year.

National Museum Act Program
The National Museum Act of 1966 reaffirmed the Smithsonian’s traditional role of providing assistance to other museums and authorized the Institution to strengthen its activities of service to them. In 1976, the Act was reauthorized to extend into fiscal years 1978, 1979, and 1980. The kinds of assistance specifically referred to in the Act include cooperating with museums in the United States and abroad in the continuing study of museum problems and opportunities, preparation of museum publications, research in museum techniques, and cooperation with agencies of the government concerned with museums. Achievement of these objectives is fulfilled through the administration of a series of program grants made available to museums, nonprofit museum-related organizations and associations, academic institutions, and individuals employed or sponsored by eligible organizations.
Projects sponsored by the National Museum Act must be of substantial value to the museum profession as a whole; they must contribute to the improvement of museum methods and practices or to the professional enhancement of individuals entering or working in the museum field.
During 1976, individual grant program descriptions were carefully reviewed and clarified, and distributed widely, in a new format, to the museum community and to those institutions of higher learning desiring to develop educational and training programs in museum management and other museum specializations. During this year there was also a continuing refinement and updating of the administrative procedures through which grant applications are received, evaluated, awarded, and reviewed.
The nine individual grant programs offered in 1976 can be grouped into three general categories: those affording increased opportunities for training and education in museum practices; those supporting special studies and research activities related to museum techniques and methods; and those offering a variety of professional and technical services to museums.
Financial resources for the National Museum Act in fiscal year 1976 amounted to $768,938, and an additional appropriation of $194,500 was made available for the transition quarter (July
Museum Programs / 225

<<<Page: 236>>>

through September, 1976). A total of 175 proposals, requesting more than $2.9 million for project support, were received from applicants during the fifteen-month period.
Applications for support are reviewed by an Advisory Council composed of museum professionals who represent a cross section of museum interests and disciplines, as well as broad geographic regions of the country. The Council also assists with the determination of policies governing the grant programs and with the establishment of standards which applicants must meet.
Members of the Advisory Council in 1976 were:
William T. Alderson, Director, American Association for State and Local History Robert Feller, Senior Fellow, National Gallery of Art Research Project, Carnegie-Mellon Institute of Research Weldon D. Frankforter, Director, Grand Rapids Public Museum Bonnie Pitman Gelles, Museum Consultant, Washington, D.C. Julia Hotton, Assistant Director, Public Affairs and Development, The Brooklyn Museum Phillip S. Humphrey, Director, Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas Arminta Neal, Assistant Director, Denver Museum of Natural History Joseph Noble, President, American Association of Museums and Director, Museum of the City of New York Barnes Riznik, Director, Grove Farm Plantation Mitchell Wilder, Director, Amon Carter Museum of Western Art Vernal L. Yadon, Director, Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History Paul N. Perrot, Chairman, Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, Smithsonian Institution
After review of applications submitted in 1976, the Advisory Council recommended that seventy-five projects be funded, for a total of $892,659. Of this amount, $295,739 was directed to conservation training and research activities to be undertaken by applicants.
Fifty-seven of the approved projects were associated with the educational programs supported by the Act and provided training opportunities in one form or another for more than two thousand individuals entering or working in the museum field. Through the Advanced Academic Degree Program, five museum professionals were able to undertake graduate studies in their areas of expertise.
226 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 237>>>

Seven individuals engaged in specialized training activities in conservation techniques under the Stipends for Conservation Studies Program. One individual, for example, studied with a leading paper conservator at the Royal Library in The Hague. Thirteen grants for Museum Internships and Graduate/Professional Education and Training made it possible for many beginning professionals to receive theoretical and practical training in various museum functions such as exhibition, administration, education, conservation, and curation. Nineteen museum professionals enhanced their professional museum skills through the study of collections, operations, and practices of museums in the United States and abroad under the Travel Program. Travel Programs benefited not only the individuals making visits to other museums, but also those colleagues with whom they had come in contact during the course of their studies. Substantial numbers of the profession were able to take advantage of continuing educational and training opportunities provided by thirteen regional Seminar/Workshop Program grants. These seminars and workshops presented topics as varied as administrative procedures for the small museum, computer usage in museums, and museum programs for the handicapped, and were attended by professionals from all parts of the United States and from Europe, Africa, and Australia.
During 1976, the National Museum Act supported eight projects under the Special Studies and Research Program, among which were investigations into uses of ultrasonics for art and architectural conservation, personnel policies within museums, and techniques of paper conservation.
Ten Professional and Technical Assistance Program grants permitted museums and museum associations to offer specialized assistance to the museum community. In several instances, assistance took the form of consultation services for individual museums seeking advice and guidance on conservation, exhibition design, lighting, and similar matters. One important assistance project provided the natural history community with comprehensive, centralized information on laws and regulations affecting the collection, accession, maintenance, and transport of natural history specimens.
A list of projects supported by the National Museum Act during 1976 is found in Appendix 3.

Office of Exhibits Central
The Bicentennial programs of the Smithsonian Institution largely dictated the direction and commitments of the Office of Exhibits Central (okc) in fiscal year 1976. In one form or another, OEc participated in virtually every Bicentennial program. Occasionally orc’s contributions were limited and specific, but more often they were continuing and extensive; all demanded special skills.
In support of the summer-long Festival of American Folklife, oEcC provided a range of services from hand-lettered signs to cinematography. orc’s work began months before the Festival, continued for its duration, and included directing many willing but untrained persons in techniques of exhibit production.
Two prominent exhibitions in which orc was actively involved on many levels were presented in the Smithsonian “Castle” in conjunction with the visits of Emperor Hirohito (October 1975) and Queen Elizabeth II (July 1976). orc designed, produced, and installed “Art Treasures from the Imperial Collections of the Japanese Imperial Household” and wrote, designed, produced, and installed “Treasures of London.” For Queen Elizabeth’s tour of the “Castle,” OEC engineered an unprecedented but elegant exhibition of the most extraordinary and priceless gems in the Smithsonian’s collections.
In addition to its special support of and participation in the exhibitions of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services, OEC assisted in some way virtually every other bureau and office of the Smithsonian.
The Motion Picture Unit of ogc received a Silver Plaque at the 11th International Film Festival for the film Festival of American Folklife, 1975. The film was presented by the American Airlines InFlight Theatre for thirty days and was shown by thirty-six television stations. The award-winning film has also been run in schools, before various special groups, and by usia at international film festivals. The Motion Picture unit also produced 1876, a 30minute film that tells the story of the Centennial Exposition (held in 1876 at Philadelphia). About 300 members of the Smithsonian staff appear in the film; its first prints have been enthusiastically received.
The occ Editors’ office served the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service in many ways, editing not only exhibition

scripts but often also writing and editing a wide range of supplementary materials. Among the most comprehensive of these programs in 1976 were “White House China,” which opened in December at the National Museum of History and Technology prior to its tour; ““Toys from Switzerland” (the larger of two versions opened in May at the Swiss Embassy in Washington); ‘Naive Art of Yugoslavia’; and “The Dye Is Now Cast,” which otc converted from a stationary exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery into a traveling version. Other exhibits in which the otc editors figured prominently were the Hirshhorn’s ““Golden Door,” a major Bicentennial exhibit; the Leonardo exhibition at mut (which like “Treasures of London” marked Queen Elizabeth’s tour of the United States; and the Columbus exhibition at MutT, opened by King Juan Carlos of Spain.
The Museum Lighting staff continued to promote energy conservation on new lighting projects and upgraded existing ones. The staff also conducted workshops in museum lighting and provided consultation and guidance to other museums throughout the nation.
The Freeze-Dry taxidermy laboratory continued to serve the Smithsonian, and assisted and trained personnel from other museums.
In addition to the Lighting and Freeze-Dry staffs, editors, designers, and others from okc served as faculty, teaching and training the professionals enrolled in workshops and seminars that were organized by the Office of Museum Programs.
Office of Horticulture
On February 29, 1976, the Horticultural Services Division of the Office of Plant Services was reorganized and transferred to the Office of Museum Programs as the Office of Horticulture (oH). At the time of transfer, the Office was given the responsibility for all interior and exterior landscaping of the various Smithsonian Institution museums and for development of the overall scientific, research, educational, and display programs of horticulture for the Institution. Although the discipline of horticulture was added to the Institution in 1972, it was first recognized in 1976 as an official museum program rather than as a maintenance operation.
Museum Programs / 229

<<<Page: 240>>>

Throughout fiscal year 1976, the Office of Horticulture has attempted to assist each of the Smithsonian’s museums and some related organizations in the presentation of their Bicentennial exhibitions. For example, oH provided consultation and horticultural plantings for the Festival of American Folklife and plants for “America on Stage” and other special events at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. In September 1975, oH provided plantings of Japanese origin for the exhibition “Art Treasures from the Imperial Collections of the Japanese Imperial Household.”
In December 1975, the Office of Horticulture designed and installed plantings for the “Centennial Christmas Ball” given by the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates. All of the decorations, including hundreds of yards of paper-cut stars, bells, and roping, were authentic to the 1876 era. The entire rotunda of the National Museum of Natural History was transformed into a botanical “conservatory.” The proceeds from this ball, totaling $20,000, were donated to on for a new ““mini-garden” between the Arts and Industries building and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s West Wall. This garden will be developed as a fivesenses garden for the visually and physically handicapped and will feature herbal and medicinal plants with aromatic flowers and foliage or unusual textured stems and will contain a major water feature. Plans are well underway for the development of this garden in fiscal year 1977.
In the fall of 1975, the Office of Horticulture installed 120,000 tulip bulbs for the spring display of 1976, followed by 120,000 summer annuals and 5,000 ornamental flowering kale and cabbage for the fall and winter season of 1976. In June, on installed a new perennial border along the Ninth Street underpass of the National Museum of Natural History.
In “The Federal City” exhibit, oH provided documentation for the horticultural plantings of the A. J. Downing Plan for the Mall of the 1850s, as well as interior plants for this exhibition.
The highlight of the Bicentennial year was the research and installation of the horticultural plantings for the “1876” exhibition in the Arts and Industries Building. The Arts and Industries rotunda was selected as the setting to evoke the great Horticultural Hall of the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The Commissioners of

Fairmount Park agreed to a one-year loan of the Foley Fountain that was the centerpiece of the Horticultural Hall. Within the “1876” exhibit, on attempted to duplicate the horticultural and botanical extravaganza of the Centennial Exposition by installing eight 25-foot Cocos plumosa, ten 25-foot fishtail palms, and one 25-foot Ficus nitida, along with hundreds of small tropicals including mahogany, dracaena, dieffenbachia, crotons, and other varieties of plants that were known to have been in the displays in Horticultural Hall in 1876. A duplicate of the “Henry A. Dreer Sales Case,” installed in the North Hall, contains replicas of dried flower bouquets, immortelles, dried grasses, floral initials, pressed flower pictures, and other decorative objects known to have been displayed by the firm at the Centennial Exposition. These arrangements were researched and reproduced by the on staff in conjunction with Ms. Sunny O’Neil of Washington, D.C.
To the west of the Arts and Industries Building, on completed the new Victorian Garden that complements the Smithsonian Institution and Arts and Industries buildings and the “1876” exhibition. This new garden opened on September 27, 1976, with authentic embroidery parterres and a geometric star bed requiring approximately 40,000 Alternanthera bettzicaina or Jacob’s Coat. These plantings were modeled after the sunken parterre at the west end of the Horticultural Hall in 1876. In addition, hardy trees, shrubs, tubbed tropicals, and annuals were installed to enhance the ambience of the Centennial. Within the Garden, Office of Horticulture displays its antique and cast-reproduction collection of Victorian urns, benches, wickets, and other garden accessories. Additional permanent plantings and floral beds will be added in the spring of 1977.
Massive Victorian floral arrangements were provided in the “Castle” building for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain, and in the Arts and Industries Building for Mrs. Helmut Schmidt, the First Lady of the Federal Republic of Germany. Mrs. Schmidt was the first official visitor to the New Victorian Garden. Special floral arrangements were also provided for the many state visits made to the Institution during the Bicentennial year.
In the summer of 1976, oH assumed responsibility for the interior and exterior landscaping of the National Air and Space Museum (July) and renovated the grounds and conservatory of the CooperHewitt Museum in New York City (September). Additional projects

under development include the relandscaping of the East Entrance of the Smithsonian Institution Building and new proposals for the east side of the National Air and Space Museum.
At the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, thirty Weeping Beeches were installed in August in the four new planter boxes on the East Plaza. In late September, twenty-two evergreen euonymus, ’ were installed around the west, north, and east walls and in the Sculpture Garden. Additional
landscaping is now under consideration.

The Horticultural Advisory Committee of the Institution met in September 1975 and May 1976 to discuss shortand long-term projects for the on, including the Victorian Garden, “1876,” greenhouse-nursery development, the Cooper-Hewitt renovation, the mini-garden for the visually handicapped, the Orchid Collection, the State Flower and State Tree Project, and many other horticultural activities. oH requested each of the fifty states to donate to the Institution at least three state flowers and state trees as a Bicentennial gift. These plants are being used in a landscape scheme around our museums and will be appropriately labeled. An Orchid Subcommittee of the Horticultural Advisory Committee was established in September 1975 to develop a research, display, and conservation collection of Orchidaceae. During the past year the Subcommittee gave recommendations and assisted oH in maintenance of the orchid collection of Hillwood Gardens.
In August, oH received the Grand Award from the Professional Grounds Management Society for the best maintained overall governmental complex in the United States. This award is based on the degree of difficulty in maintaining a landscape and general overall appearance.
Office of Museum Programs
The increasing demands placed upon museum professionals by a public evermore aware of the resources that museums have to offer and the growing use of museum collections in research and the interpretation of historic phenomena have made it more imperative than ever for members of the museum profession to sharpen their techniques. Several distinct departments within the Office of Mu-
Museum Programs / 233

<<<Page: 244>>>

seum Programs concentrate the major part of their activity on professional enhancement, as well as on research into methods which will increase the effectiveness of museum operations.
The Conservation Information Program is circulating a series of eighty video-tape lectures on the principles of conservation to museums and related organizations across the country. Since July 1, 1975, these tapes have had 505 showings, and this number is expected to increase in fiscal year 1977.
A series of slide tape programs on various practical aspects of conservation was completed and’is also being circulated nationally. There were 499 showings during the year. Programs on seven different subjects are now available and an additional five are in preparation.
Thirty workshops concerned with all phases of museum operations including management, exhibit design, educational programs, curatorial practices, registrarial methods, publication development, fund-raising, membership development, and conservation principles have been developed. Participants come from all parts of the country and the needs are so evident that the variety of these offerings will be expanded.
The Office of Museum Programs coordinates the activities of foreign and United States interns who come to Washington for a period of weeks or months to study various aspects of museum management. During the year, participants from Saudi Arabia, Botswana, England, and Nigeria were serviced. In addition, consultations and short visits were arranged for colleagues from India, Peru, Tasmania, Argentina, Uruguay, West Irian, Thailand, Romania, Nigeria, New Zealand, and England. A special training program for native Americans has been developed in cooperation with the Department of Anthropology of the National Museum of Natural History. It is expected that the program will be operational by mid-year.
A two-day conference on the requirements of museum training was conducted at the Belmont Conference Center in cooperation with the National Museum Act. The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the major museum-training programs in the United States. This meeting led to the creation, by the American Association of Museums, of a training committee that will provide

ongoing evaluation of museum-training needs and curriculum requirements.
The Museum Information Center was established as a branch of the Smithsonian Libraries. Its primary responsibility is to assemble books, periodicals, monographs, and research papers relating to museum operations and management. For the first time such materials have been assembled and collected on a systematic basis and are available for use in one location.
In its continued effort to determine the effectiveness of museum displays, the Psychological Studies Program completed a number of internal reports. The Measurement and Facilitation of Learning in the Museum Environment, by Professor Chandler Screven was
published.
Office of the Registrar
The final steps in decentralization of traditional registration functions were completed this year with the distribution of resources and responsibilities to the National Museum of History and Technology and the National Museum of Natural History. These two museums (the only ones which still lacked operational independence) now have local control over their own registration activities.
The Office of the Registrar, no longer encumbered by dual obligations, is free to concentrate fully on its primary responsibility: the information management aspect of collections management at the Institutional level. Coordination of registration activities is being provided by the Central Registrar and the Council of Registrars whose role has continued to expand during the past year. In addition to regular monthly meetings at which business is transacted and featured professional discussions are presented, the Council sponsors a variety of cooperative projects in areas of mutual concern.
The Office itself, while continuing to serve as a clearinghouse for Council matters, pursues projects of its own at the Institutional level. In addition to providing editorial and logistics support for the Institution’s current study of collections policy and management, members of the Office of the Registrar’s staff are pursuing a num-

ber of fact-gathering investigations for input to the study report. With the conclusion this year of a consultant’s study of existing information systems at the Institution’s Mall facilities, the Office has begun a detailed review of the consultant’s recommendations toward the objectives of implementing those plans deemed appropriate and feasible.
One project, which started last year as an effort to develop Institution-wide information systems for access to the national collections, progressed this year to the point where it has generated an entire family of related projects. Consequently, the Office is engaged in such things as a data-element inventory, an analysis of potential subject thesauri, a critical review of real as opposed to imagined networking needs, and a feasibility study of data-processing standards for the storage and retrieval of information pertaining to collected objects and specimens. In connection with the standards effort, the intent is to use the Institution as a catalyst for the development of published national and perhaps international standards for use by the collecting community as a whole.
Smithsonian Institution Archives
During fiscal year 1976, the Smithsonian Archives moved to new quarters in the Arts and Industries Building. New stack space ultimately will provide for 10,000 cubic feet of records and manuscripts, while the new reading room offers improved facilities for patrons. Much staff time was devoted to the production of a new Guide to the Smithsonian Archives, which is scheduled for publication in 1977.
Work continued on the records of the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of History and Technology, and the National Collection of Fine Arts. Records surveys were conducted at the National Portrait Gallery and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design. In September, the Deputy Archivist went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to survey the records of the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, and arranged for the transfer of the Center’s files to the Archives, in conjunction with the Center’s separation from the Smithsonian.
Major accessions were received from the Smithsonian Astro-
236 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 247>>>

physical Observatory, the National Museum of Natural History, and the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange. The Accession Records of the United States National Museum were accessioned from the Office of the Registrar, and the Archives serviced the records for the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of History and Technology. Other accessions of note include the papers of Leonard P. Schultz and Howard Chapelle, as well as additions to the papers of Charles G. Abbot and James A. Peters.
The Archives’ Oral History Program was continued. Since the program’s inception in 1974, over one hundred hours of tape, comprising interviews with some thirty individuals, have been accumulated. During fiscal year 1976, Program emphasis was on the history of the National Museum of Natural History.
Scholars continued to visit the Archives in increasing numbers. Several recent publications have appeared, based at least in part on material in the Archives. Among them are: Nathan Reingold, editor, The Papers of Joseph Henry: November 1832—December 1835, The Princeton Years (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975); Sally Gregory Kohlstedt, The Formation of the American Scientific Community: The American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1848-1860 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1976); and articles by Sally Gregory Kohlstedt, Nathan Reingold, Bruce Sinclair, and Henry D. Shapiro, which appeared in Alexander Oleson and Sanborn C. Brown, editors, The Pursuit of Knowledge in the Early American Republic: American Scientific and Learned Societies from Colonial Times to the Civil War (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976).
Smithsonian Institution Libraries
During the Bicentennial year, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries added approximately 20,000 volumes to the collections of catalogued library materials. The collections of the Library of the National Air and Space Museum, previously uncatalogued, were fully catalogued and in place on the shelves well in time for the Museum’s opening—a special project accomplishment by the Libraries’ Technical Services Division.
Museum Programs / 237

<<<Page: 248>>>

Dr. Bern Dibner’s gift of rare materials in the history of science and technology arrived from the Burndy Library in Norwalk, Connecticut. Among the nearly 8,000 volumes in the gift are hundreds of classical works, including 200 epochal books and pamphlets, listed in the Burndy Library catalogue, Heralds of Science. The Dibner Library is located in a handsomely decorated room in the National Museum of History and Technology Building, and formally opened in the fall of 1976. Other notable gifts are listed in Appendix 9. As in previous years, the Libraries’ collections were enriched by the many friends who donated books to the collections.
The Libraries estimated that, in addition to the more than 793,000 volumes of catalogued materials, more than 200,000 volumes of unrecorded library materials are owned by the Smithsonian Institution. In 1977 the Libraries will investigate techniques for creating a record of these uncatalogued materials, so that users will have greater accessibility to them.
The Libraries’ program placed a high priority upon the building and preservation of materials. A conservator and a handbinder were recruited for the staff, and plans are underway for a conservation laboratory at 1111 North Capitol Street. Volumes which had deteriorated were identified, and those materials which are of significance to the collections were microfilmed. This marked the initiation of a poor-paper microfilming project for the Libraries. In addition to the filming of deteriorated materials, the Libraries began to replace long runs of reference and bibliographic materials with commercial microform editions. The critical space situation in the Libraries makes this replacement imperative. In the future, an increasing number of library materials will be acquired in microform format, to save both space and money.
Various moves took place during the year. The move into the new National Air and Space Museum Library, from the old facility in the Arts and Industries Building, has been mentioned. Included in that Library is the Ramsey Rare Book Room, which contains some notable materials dealing with the history of air and space. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was physically consolidated with the Harvard College Observatory Library, although each Library maintains its own catalogue and continues to serve its own users. The Libraries’ facility at Lamont Street was moved to 1111 North Capitol Street.
238 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 249>>>

Library space on the Mall is inadequate to house all of the materials needed by the Smithsonian staff for the reasearch, exhibit, education, and public service programs supported by the Libraries; therefore, more materials will be housed at the North Capitol Street facility. Plans are underway to refurbish the space, making it into a viable unit.
The Libraries continued to make use of advanced technology. A third terminal has been acquired for communication with the Ohio College Library Center (octc). In addition to receiving catalogue cards from the more than two million bibliographic records stored at octc, in 1976 the Libraries began to contribute original cataloguing to the octc data base. The Libraries received catalogue cards of the original work, and the octc data base is enriched.
The union list of more than 14,000 serials currently received by the Libraries has been printed by the computer. This year an experiment was undertaken to produce the record in computer output microform (com), as another attempt to use microform to save space and funds. The Libraries’ converted, machine-readable files can be economically reproduced in multiple copies for distribution to the Libraries’ branches as needed.
Several units in the Libraries were reorganized. The Bibliographic Support Services unit was established. This unit supports both Acquisitions Services and Cataloguing Services by performing all of the bibliographic searching and verification required for acquiring and cataloguing materials, thus reducing duplication of effort. In addition, the Bibliographic Support Services unit is responsible for scheduling use of the octc terminals and for accepting ocLc catalogue copy when no revisions are required by professional cataloguers.
The support functions of the Libraries were consolidated in a newly created Office of Management and Development. The Office is responsible for planning, budgeting, management and fiscal information reporting, fiscal record-keeping, supplies, equipment, space utilization, personnel, and systems development.
An intensive study of a randomly selected sample of 700 Smithsonian Institution staff members was completed. The resulting ‘““Report of Survey of Smithsonian Institution Libraries Users’ was distributed to all Smithsonian units. In general, users expressed satisfaction with the Libraries’ services and collections. The results

of the survey were intensively reviewed by the Libraries’ staff and users, in order to plan ways to improve the services and collections.
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service
Fiscal year 1976 was a busy one for the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (sites). In addition to the normal inauguration of new exhibitions, exhibits produced with special congressional appropriations for the Bicentennial began their tours, making a total for the year of 48 new titles, or 114 new exhibitions counting duplicates and additional versions.
Supplementing these exhibitions were nineteen publications, among them major catalogues, such as American Art in the Making, American Presidential China, and Workers and Allies: Female Participation in the American Trade Union Movement, 1824-1976. In addition, smaller catalogues, brochures, and posters were produced by sires to accompany new exhibitions.
Bicentennial exhibitions dominated the year’s program. SITES planning for the Bicentennial began in fiscal year 1975, with a commitment to double its audience and the number of available exhibitions dealing with aspects of American history and culture. Realizing that sires was the only national traveling exhibition service that would offer such shows for Bicentennial programs, and recognizing that it would be impossible to meet the projected demand with expensive exhibitions of original artifacts, sires developed the “information core” exhibition concept. The idea was simple, new, and exciting. An exhibitor would provide his own artifacts to supplement an exhibition on a complementary theme. SITES set to work with a list of possible “information core” topics: furniture, music, photography, political history, and agriculture. Enthusiastic curators throughout the Smithsonian either volunteered themselves and their staffs to develop exhibits or recommended specialists whom sites placed on contract. Eleven “information core” exhibitions produced a total of fifty-three shows. Workbooks written and compiled by the sires education staff were provided to each exhibitor, to aid planning activities and installations.
These “information core” exhibitions, combined with panel

shows developed and produced from major Smithsonian exhibitions (such as ‘The Dye Is Now Cast” of the National Portrait Gallery and the Henry Luce Hall of News Reporting of the National Museum of History and Technology), often constituted the basic program for a community’s Bicentennial observances. For example, between six and ten sites exhibitions were seen in Junction City, Kansas; Middletown, Ohio; Wichita, Kansas; and throughout the state of Wisconsin (under the sponsorship of that state’s Bicentennial Commission). These exhibitions were supplemented by activities as varied as band concerts; bicycle parades; costumed openings; couturier workshops; demonstrations of printing presses, spinning wheels, and looms; miniature reenactments of Revolutionary War battles; and many speakers, films, and school group tours. Bicentennial exhibitions of original art and artifacts that began their tours in fiscal year 1976 include: ‘American Presidential China,” which opened at the National Museum of History and Technology; ““American Prints from Wood,” which includes a technical section on making wood prints; “Lilliput, USA,” an exhibition

The sites “International Salute to the States” program (iss), which sponsors tours of major international exhibitions, got underway in fiscal year 1976 and was highlighted by Queen Elizabeth’s visit to the “Treasures from London” exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution “Castle.” Ten other 1ss exhibitions began their tours, including: “Silverworks from Rio de la Plata, Argentina”; ‘The Fourth Part of the World,” a major exhibition from Australia; “Edvard Munch: The Major Graphics,” from Norway; and ‘Naive Art in Yugoslavia.”
Nineteen additional exhibitions are currently planned for the 1ss program. Most of these are in the final stages of organization and production, with only a few remaining under negotiation. The sires

staff has been preparing or contributing to major publications or educational materials for almost every exhibition in this program.
Support funds from the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration for the sires program and from special appropriations have contributed to a substantial increase in the size and scope of SITES program. An American Studies Office within sites has been established to maintain exhibit offerings in this field.
SITES increased its participation in professional museum services by cooperating again with George Washington University’s Museum Education Program, and training interns by holding a week-long seminar on traveling exhibitions for museum professionals, under the sponsorship of the Office of Museum Programs. Staff members also attended and spoke at various national and regional museum conferences. sites developed a fifteen-minute slide program of its activities for such conferences, seminars, and orientation sessions.
sires staff members traveled extensively during the past fiscal year, negotiating new exhibitions and inspecting those on tour. Visits were made to Argentina, Austria, France, Norway, Tunisia, Finland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Canada, Switzerland, and Iran, as well as to many cities within the United States.
SITES expanded its annual catalogue of available exhibitions, Update, to a larger format, allowing a full page for each exhibition description. Update is mailed annually to approximately 12,000 interested organizations and individuals.

Basically the summer-long Festival of American Folklife was just folks . some three to four million people from all over the country who came to share in the story of what being an American during the two-hundredth-year celebration meant to them. The Festival in Washington culminated ten years of celebrating the vital and continuing folk traditions, arts, and skills of America.

Smithsonian Year + 1976 PUBLIC SERVICE
FOR THOSE WHOSE MAIN CONCERN at the Smithsonian Institution is the vital and demanding area known as Public Service, the past year was unusual and busy, highlighted by the national observance of the American Revolution Bicentennial. New and diverse opportunities arising from the Bicentennial celebration provided the Smithsonian with the opportunity to tell audiences totaling many millions about the past, present, and future of their nation, as well as about the Institution that is viewed as the “trustee of the nation’s heritage.”
The Bicentennial stimulated all of the Public Service divisions to develop and offer activities and programs that appropriately marked the nation’s birthday and brought new facts and insights to those who came to Washington for observance. A central mission of Public Service is the “diffusion of knowledge” in a challenging era when a growing desire has been felt among Americans of all ages to learn more about their society and the world in which they live.
An enthusiastic public response greeted the summer-long Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife. Several million people attended the twelve-week event presented by the Division of Performing Arts with the National Park Service and sponsored by American Airlines and General Foods. More than 5,000 participants from each of the 50 states, 38 foreign countries, 55 unions and organizations, and 116 native American tribal groups from every region of the United States took part in the songs, dances, crafts, and activities that expressed their heritage.
In an editorial published upon the close of the highly successful Festival, the Washington Post said, in part:
“There seems to be general agreement that the Festival of Ameri-

<<<Page: 256>>>

can Folklife was among the most inspired and inspiring events in the nation’s Bicentennial celebration.”
Public Service is directing a comprehensive assessment of how, when, and if such festivals might be staged by the Smithsonian in the post-Bicentennial period. Meanwhile, wide and appreciative recognition has been paid to the imagination, skill, and devotion of the Division of Performing Arts in presenting what was probably the largest continuing outdoor event in the history of the Institution.
In addition to the Festival, the Division of Performing Arts prepared for innovations in its regular winter concert series which is so popular in Washington. A new series on country guitar was arranged with some of the finest players in America, as well as programs on “The Blues,” “American Popular Song,” and “Jazz Heritage.”
The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum continued its production of specially developed exhibitions to mark the Bicentennial: “Black Women: Achievements Against the Odds,”” which opened in late 1975; “The Frederick Douglass Years,” which will be distributed nationally through the Smithsonian Institution’s Traveling Exhibition Service; and “The Anacostia Story.” The latter two are in the final stages of production.
The Anacostia Museum’s Exhibits and Design Laboratory building opened formally in late 1975. On July 20, 1976, the center was damaged by a serious fire that temporarily interrupted production of “The Frederick Douglass Years” and ‘The Anacostia Story.” Funds are being authorized to repair the center in a manner that will reduce hazards associated with exhibits production.
The Resident Associate Program provided a quality program of continuing education for Washington area residents by offering unique educational experiences consonant with the research, collections, and exhibitions of the Institution. Even though no new members were actively sought, a net gain of 5,500 memberships was recorded for the year, and the annual renewal rate reached a new high of 79.6 percent.
Smithsonian magazine continued its remarkable growth in popularity during the sixth year of its publication. Readership grew to 1.3 million.
The Office of Public Affairs experienced unprecedented demands
246 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 257>>>

for information and published materials to assist the press and Bicentennial visitors. Outstanding among the many events for which the Office of Special Events made arrangements was the July visit of Queen Elizabeth II, during which she paused at the crypt of James Smithson, viewed the exhibit on Washington, D.C., ““The Federal City,” and was then presented with a resolution of the Congress in appreciation of James Smithson’s bequest.
The Office of Telecommunications was established as a separate entity in recognition of the importance of television, radio, and films as major means of public education and enrichment.
With a reorganized and augmented staff, the Smithsonian Institution Press significantly increased its production of Smithsonianrelated scholarly books and improved its performance in the tradebook-publishing field.
The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education expanded its teacher-workshop and school-publications program. A summer intern program brought twenty-four high school students from rural and inner-city communities for projects under Smithsonian staff guidance. The Office also coordinated efforts to promote equal access for handicapped visitors to exhibits and programs.
The Office of Symposia and Seminars organized two major activities related to the Bicentennial year. The Office conducted workshops as a part of its continuing “Your Own American Experience” program which encourages nonnative Americans to find out and record where they came from and how they got here and to trace what has happened to them since. An international conference, “The United States in the World,” brought distinguished foreign specialists together to give presentations on American influences abroad in agriculture, public health, education, labor, architecture, music, journalism, and film.
Reading Is Fundamental (r1F) celebrated its tenth anniversary as a national, nonprofit program designed to motivate children to read. The number of rir programs increased to over 400 in 47 states and the District of Columbia. One of rir’s major Bicentennial projects was a guide to book selection for general use. More than 9,800 copies of this guide were distributed to public libraries across the nation.
The Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Center performed myriad services for the Bicentennial visitors, who, though
Public Service / 247

<<<Page: 258>>>

less numerous than had been anticipated, nevertheless required the dedicated counsel of some 187 volunteers. With the permanent staff of 17, these volunteers handled more than 200,000 telephone inquiries and many hundreds of thousands of visitor demands for information. Several hundred thousand orientation brochures were distributed to visitors by the Center’s staff.
The International Exhange Service continued the program established in 1851 of exchanging publications of this country with those of other nations.
Anacostia Neighborhood Museum
Begun nine years ago as a community museum, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum (Aanm) has now grown into an institution with an audience that extends from Anacostia to cities, large and small, across the nation. Through its exhibitions, approaches to education, programs, and catalogues, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum continues to attract museologists, students, interns, and visitors from around the country and from as far away as Africa and Guam. Scholars and students from local and national colleges and universities come to share in the experience of creating a cultural institution.
The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum has worked to broaden its appeal and to involve large numbers of minorities in a participatory program that builds positive images of ethnic groups, which, for too long, have not been equitably represented in the great exhibition halls of the more traditional museums. One expression of this commitment is the Museum’s oral history program, which has its origins in the African heritage. This commitment is also evidenced in the Museum’s ongoing research of local history, documenting the contributions of blacks, German sharecroppers, English and Scottish immigrants, and others who peopled the region known today as Anacostia. The Museum has also sought collateral relationships with private and governmental museums and institutions, affording larger audience participation in this cultural awakening. One result of these collaborative efforts was the John Robinson exhibition that was presented at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The show offered a
248 / Smithsonian Year 1976 F

retrospective display of the creative talents and skills of an Anacostian Afro-American artist.
Clearly, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum has not adopted an isolationist policy: while sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the local residents, the Museum is not parochial in its exhibits, programs, or outlook. In conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, the Museum will be circulating exhibits that it has researched, designed, and produced to communities throughout the nation.
Programs conducted in the museum included a Young People’s Film Festival and activities designed to support and complement ANM’s two Bicentennial exhibits, “Blacks in the Westward Movement” and “Black Women: Achievements Against the Odds.” Audiences participated in workshops, conducted by an American Indian, that focused on the cultural and religious life of the Sioux and allowed them to share some of the Sioux nation’s customs and foods. A highly successful lecture series “Black Women Speak,” accompanied the “Black Women” exhibition. Conducted in the Museum’s exhibit hall and in the community, the series addressed a number of topics of interest and sparked provocative discussions between students, residents, and lecturers, who brought expertise from such varied disciplines as education, psychology, psychiatry, medicine, folk history, and social work. This continuing program, initiated at the beginning of the month-long celebration of the study of Afro-American life and history, opened its fall series with an address by the Honorable Shirley Chisholm. Her speech marked the observance of the Museum’s ninth anniversary.
The study, collection, and preservation of Anacostia history have led to the development of the Museum’s concluding Bicentennial exhibit, ““The Anacostia Story,” which culminates over four years of research, begun when an initiated its oral history project. A rekindling of interest in local history is evidenced by the growing membership of the Anacostia Historical Society. Community enthusiasm has been demonstrated by the involvement and participation of residents.
Through the acquisition of primary source materials and library volumes, the Center for Anacostia Studies has significantly increased its research capabilities. Archival materials now available

The Center for Anacostia Studies also houses the Museum’s first collection: tapes and video-tapes of oral history interviews, primary source documents, photographs, artifacts, and memorabilia. This collection represents an important assemblage of eyewitness accounts of early Anacostia history, some items dating back to 1792.
Division of Performing Arts
To celebrate 200 years of America’s cultural heritage, the Division of Performing Arts focused on research and presentations about the roots of American culture.

Efforts were organized around the Festival of American Folklife, Music at the Museum programs, and expanded publication of recordings under the Smithsonian Collection label. The Division combined forces with the Division of Musical Instruments and the National Associates for special Bicentennial projects, the Haydn Festival, and a national tour of a production of “Music and Dance from the Age of Jefferson.”
The Ninth Annual Festival of American Folklife in the summer of 1975 became a major dress rehearsal for the summer-long Bicentennial “museum out of doors” in 1976. More than nine hundred performers from Germany, Lebanon, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan, Italy, and Mexico, as well as workers in transportation, Native Americans from the Iroquois Confederacy, and participants from California and the Heartland States were involved in the 1976 Festival. Preparations for the Bicentennial Festival necessitated field surveys by nearly one hundred folklorists, who interviewed and selected the participants. The Festival featured 5,000 persons from 38 foreign countries, 55 unions and organizations, and 116 Native American tribal groups, demonstrating the astonishingly rich folk heritage that is uniquely American. Following the Festival, the performers from foreign countries were sent on tour, filling over one hundred engagements in more than fifty American cities. About five million persons attended the 12-week event, which was presented by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service and was sponsored by American Airlines and General Foods.
As the principal organization responsible for live performances at the Smithsonian, the Division offered a wide range of jazz, popular, classical and oriental music, and dance. Many presentations were accompanied by free workshops, master classes, and open rehearsals. Music was offered under eight different category headings, each seeking out the best of the old and the new. The cultural contributions of a number of leading American artists were thus honored at the Smithsonian, including a fiftieth anniversary celebration of the Mills Brothers, Mable Mercer in concert, an evening of jazz tap dancing, banjo music by Grandpa Jones, young virtuoso artists with Music from Marlboro, and contemporary composers featured by the Theater Chamber Players. Weekly events, sponsored with the Division of Musical Instruments of the National Museum of History and Technology, attracted some sixteen thou-

Glowing critical reception greeted release of five recordings under the Smithsonian Collection label: reissues of the music of King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, and Earl Hines; three new recordings of Classic Rags, Music from the Age of Jefferson, and Piano Music of Ferdinand “Jelly Roll'’ Morton, James Dapogny, pianist. The standard-bearer of the series, The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz, continued to reach an admiring public. The recordings, available nationally, are specially priced for Smithsonian Associates.
The program “Music and Dance from the Age of Jefferson,” produced for a Washington premiere, was recorded as Music from the Age of Jefferson, and toured five cities selected for their geographic representation: Charlotte, Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco, and Cleveland.
International Exchange Service
In 1851, the Smithsonian Institution established the international exchange system to provide a means for exchanging current Smith-
254 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 265>>>

sonian publications for the transactions and proceedings of scholarly institutions in other countries. Other learned bodies in the United States were allowed to participate by exchanging their publications with those of foreign organizations. In 1886, the service was designated as the bureau through which United States Government publications are exchanged with foreign governments for their official publications. This exchange includes the daily issues of the Congressional Register, Federal Register, the weekly issues of the Compilations of Presidential Documents, and all other publications designated by the Library of Congress for depository libraries. This program continues to provide service to many colleges, universities, scientific societies, and medical and dental libraries in the United States in exchange with similar organizations in countries throughout the world.
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education
Fiscal year 1976 brought new opportunities and new directions to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (oEsE).
In March 1976, as part of a growing national program for elementary and secondary schools, the experimental newspaper Art to Zoo was launched. This new four-page publication is designed to promote the use of museums, parks, libraries, zoos, and other community resources by students and teachers throughout the nation. Two pilot issues were circulated this past spring among 236 teachers in 35 schools across the United States. Art to Zoo will be distributed to a wider number of teachers during the 1976-1977 school year, and a series of regional workshops for school and museum educators will be given in conjunction with the publication. The first of these workshops—to be held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in November 1976—will involve the participation of two school systems and ten cultural institutions from the Lancaster area.
On the local level, in keeping with its responsibility to encourage cooperation and exchange of information among the Smithsonian education offices and between those offices and the District of Columbia schools, oEsE continues to offer a number of programs that have proven successful in the past. The first of these involves two publications designed specifically for a local audience: Let’s

Go (a monthly newsletter) and Learning Opportunities for Schools (an annual brochure). These publications, sent free to over 1,300 area schools, tell teachers of the ever-growing variety of Smithsonian services available to young people, and suggest ways of using museums as educational resources. Another local program is Teacher’s Day, held annually. Teacher’s Day in 1976 brought more than seventy Washington-area teachers and the Smithsonian education staff together for an informal program of special activities, including an introduction to the educational materials developed by oEsE for use with “1876: A Centennial Exhibition.”
Local teachers are also reached through an orse workshop and seminar program, now in its fifth year. During fiscal 1976, a total of 2,400 teachers participated in 84 workshops and seminars, including 3 summer courses at which curriculum units based on Smithsonian resources were developed for use in the classroom. Ongoing summer workshops consisted of an orientation program, “Tuesdays at the Smithsonian;” a seminar on museum teaching methods; and a 3-week special in-service course given in cooperation with the

Fairfax County Park Authority and the Fairfax County Public Schools.
In June, July, and August 1975, an oese-sponsored pilot program for summer interns brought twenty-two promising high school seniors from rural and inner-city communities to the Smithsonian to engage in learning service projects. The students worked under the guidance of curatorial and professional staff members in various parts of the Institution. One intern, Mr. Eric Seip, assisted in the dismantling of the Dunham School classroom, which is now a part of “A Nation of Nations” exhibition. In 1976, the Summer Intern Program had twenty-four participating students. A grant from the DeWitt Wallace Reader’s Digest Scholarship Fund made this effort possible.
Office of Public Affairs
The year of the American Bicentennial at the Smithsonian was an exciting, dramatic, and productive period for the mass media in their continuing coverage of the Institution. Around the world, thousands of column-inches about Smithsonian events appeared in newspapers, periodicals, and books. Radio and television, locally and nationally, featured many audiovisual originations on events and exhibits at the Institution. It was a period of unusual media interest, in which a parade of correspondents from many points came to the Smithsonian in search of articles relevant to accomplishments in the prime disciplines for which the Institution is world renowned—the arts, the sciences, and history.
A new directory of Smithsonian knowledge resources is in preparation to orient members of the media to the knowledgeable authorities at the Institution so they can talk with Smithsonian experts in fields ranging from gastropods to gallaxies, anthropology to zoology.
Major activities included assistance in arranging media coverage for the openings of the National Air and Space Museum, dedicated by President Gerald R. Ford on July 1, 1976; “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” in the renovated Arts and Industries Building on May 10, 1976; and the “A Nation of Nations” exhibit at the

The News Bureau continued to provide such services as publication of the Calendar of the Smithsonian Institution, maintenance of code-a-phones as a source of daily information for the public, publication of the employee house organ Torch, and issuance of Smithsonian Research Reports.
The Publications section revised the basic orientation leaflet for visitors, published in English, German, French, Spanish, and Japanese. More than a million copies of the English version were printed for distribution during the Bicentennial peak period. Articles about the Smithsonian to be published in encyclopedias, travel guides, and museum community periodicals were reviewed for accuracy.
The News Bureau also serviced requests from radio and television producers for features on newsworthy activities and staff of the Institution. Some 304 press releases were issued during the year.
The Telecommunications Branch developed and produced audiovisual material and worked with numerous television, film, and radio producers on projects which would bring to America and foreign audiences a better understanding of the activities of the Institution. These projects ranged from a half-hour film on the National Museum of Natural History to an Encyclopaedia Britannica filmstrip series to television and radio promotional “spots” highlighting Bicentennial endeavors.
The Special Events staff assisted in the planning, preparation, and coordination of lectures, award presentations, conferences, symposia, exhibit openings, luncheons, dinners, and other events throughout the Institution. Additional undertakings included numerous Bicentennial observations, such as the opening of “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” and assistance in the National Air and Space Museum opening. Arrangements were also made for a State Dinner honoring Their Majesties The Emperor and Empress of Japan; other foreign dignitaries visiting in honor of the Bicentennial included Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain; His Majesty Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; Her Majesty Margrethe II, Queen of Denmark and His Royal Highness Henrik, The Prince of Denmark; Their Majesties the King and Queen of Spain; His Royal Highness Harald, Crown Prince of Norway; His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan; and Her Royal Highness Princess Paola of Belgium.

Office of Smithsonian Symposia and Seminars
Preliminary to the Institution’s sixth international symposium in June 1977, the Office of Smithsonian Symposia and Seminars developed a special program of workshops, seminars, and public lectures for June 14-16, 1976, formally introducing its activities celebrating “Kin and Communities: The Peopling of America” as an educational contribution to the Bicentennial observance. Described by Israel Shenker in The New York Times as a “floating rap game,” these informal meetings were designed to stimulate each of us to discover (or rediscover) one’s own American experience by learning more about his family history and its particular contribution to the genesis and growth of our country and civilization.
A second major program of the Office also pursued the Institution’s goal of disseminating the fruits of scholarly investigations and insights about the ideas, customs, skills, and art of various cultures and civilizations: Two hundred years of American history—

what difference has it made? This was the central question posed to approximately three hundred distinguished scholars and specialists invited from over fifty countries at a major international Bicentennial conference, ““The United States in the World,” held September 26—October 1, 1976, at the Smithsonian. Working sessions were devoted to science and technology, politics, education, reform movements, business enterprise, film and television, music, architecture, and the printed media. At the end of the conference week, there were open forums during which other topics were discussed. The program committee, composed of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations (the American Studies Association, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Smithsonian Institution), made it a point to invite practicing architects, scientists, composers, business executives, journalists, etc., rather than American studies scholars, in order to obtain a fresh perspective on the United States’ cultural contributions in specific fields of endeavor and to see how these have been adopted and adapted in different societies.
Reading Is Fundamental, Inc.
Reading Is Fundamental, now in its eleventh year, continues to grow throughout the United States. More than four hundred local community projects operate in forty-seven states—in cities, small towns, and remote rural areas.
RIF was founded by Mrs. Robert McNamara in 1966 as a reading motivation program for children. Since 1968, it has been housed in the Smithsonian Institution.
Freedom of choice and pride of ownership are the basic tenets of Reading Is Fundamental. The implementation is simple, i.e., children choose from a large selection of books, keeping the ones that interest them. In this way, the purpose of r1rR—motivating children to read—is fulfilled.
Studies of this national, nonprofit organization indicate that RIF is getting books to children and generating the desired enthusiasm in the communities and with the youngsters themselves. Each project organizes and supports its own activities. The result has been the

Published in the winter of 1976, in cooperation with the Association of American Publishers, the Bicentennial Guide to Book Selection lists 3,000 titles and over 270 publishers and distributors. Mrs. Kathryn Lumley, one of the founding members of rir, compiled and edited the guide. As an author, reading consultant, and instructor of reading and language arts for the Pennsylvania State University of Continuing Education, she used her expertise to compile a comprehensive and successful guide.
The American Revolution Bicentennial Association has distributed 9,800 copies to public libraries across the nation.

Smithsonian Associates
The Institution’s membership program of the Smithsonian Associates was essentially designed for Washington area residents until the spring of 1970 when publication of the Smithsonian began. As a principal benefit of membership, the monthly magazine so stimulated interest in the program as to increase the Smithsonian Associates to more than 1,250,000 members across the country.
SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL ASSOCIATE PROGRAM Regional Program
During the past year approximately sixty-four thousand Smithsonian Associates in six cities throughout the United States were given an opportunity to share more fully in the National Associate Program. Members were invited to participate in Smithsonian events co-sponsored with museums and cultural organizations in their home communities. Charlotte, North Carolina; Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas, Texas; San Francisco, California; Cleveland, Ohio; and Tucson, Arizona were the sites of Smithsonian regional activities.
In cooperation with nine divisions of the Institution, the National

Associates presented a varied program of over fifty-one separate lectures, exhibitions, and performances in the host cities. Twenty thousand Associates responded to the invitation to expand their sense of participation and increase their understanding of the Institution’s work.
Among the offerings taken to the local Associates were: ‘Music and Dance from the Age of Jefferson,” produced by the Division of Performing Arts and the Division of Musical Instruments; “Sculptors and Their Drawings,” objects from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, “Art and the Written Word,” a sampling of the Archives of American Art, and “The National Gem Collection,” specimens from the Department of Mineral Sciences, National Museum of Natural History.
Associates Travel Program
The Domestic Tours staff continued to provide small groups of members with unusual travel experiences, rich in learning, in a variety of locales from Maine to California. Thematic weekends, for Associates from areas other than Washington, focused on a single facet of the Smithsonian’s total collection, providing an indepth study of a topic as well as an opportunity to become acquainted with the Institution and to attend a performance at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. Subject areas for the weekends included gems and minerals, the Hirshhorn collection, the National Collection of Fine Arts, and the ever popular “Christmas at the Smithsonian” program.
The Washington “Anytime” Weekend continued to be popular with the membership during 1976. Designed to give National Associates the opportunity to visit Washington and the Smithsonian any weekend during the year, the program, assisted by the Visitors Information and Associates’ Reception Center, was able to respond to the large influx of members who enjoyed the exciting Bicentennial activities.
Dedicated to a goal of providing educational and culturally oriented tours at a cost and within a time-frame affordable by a broad base of the Associate membership, the Foreign Charter Program received an overwhelming response to its initial efforts. During 1976 tours went to four new destinations and tours were repeated to satisfy the demand for visits to Great Britain and Russia. The

Program emphasized intellectual content and provided lectures, seminars, and special events in the country visited. Topics included history, literature, art, and current political, social, and economic trends. A new feature of the Charter Program introduced during 1976 was the innovative optional pre-departure program that introduced members to the Smithsonian and provided a day and a half of special lectures and social events designed to add to the participant’s understanding of the country to be visited and its people.
Contributing Membership Program
The Contributing Members of the Smithsonian Associates provide annual support for the Institution’s work in education, research, and scholarship. The Smithsonian recognizes four levels of support: Founder membership at $1,000, Sustaining at $500, Donor at $100, and Supporting at $50. In 1976 the number of Contributing Members increased from 635 to 885. Their generous support made possible, in particular, the development and expansion of educational programs for a national audience.
The Smithsonian Institution gratefully acknowledges the generous support of the Contributing Members in a listing in Appendix 8.
REEERTION GENTER: A review of the past year vividly illustrates the dramatic growth of the Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Center. Still operating from its original office in the South Tower of the “Castle,” the Center, which was established simultaneously with Smithsonian magazine six years ago, has increased its staff from two to seventeen employees in keeping with expanded visitor information programming and other added responsibilities.
Although initiated in anticipation of record Bicentennial crowds, the assignment of Building Information Coordinators in major Mall museums and galleries served necessary and timely functions; acting as liaisons between the museums and the Center, the Coordinators provided on-the-spot supervision and supplemental training for Information Volunteers, enabling them to function with greater efficiency and confidence.
To accommodate the projected number of visitors expected during the Bicentennial celebration, 187 new Information Volunteers

were recruited and trained. A total of 317 specialists, filling 56 assignments a day, produced a gratifying coverage of 90 percent for the year. Many volunteers, following special training, assumed responsibility for new information desks located in the bustling National Air and Space Museum, the Centennial exhibition in the Arts and Industries building, and in the Museum of History and Technology near the “A Nation of Nations” exhibit. From April until Labor Day, hours for all information desks were from 10 A.M. to 7 p.M., a three-hour extension of duty. All volunteers concerned with the dissemination of information were provided with yellow sashes, which insured easy identification. Installation of new, larger desks in the Museum of History and Technology, the Museum of Natural History, and the “Castle” enabled Information Volunteers to handle visitors more quickly and comfortably.

perience, responded with increased effectiveness this year to a wide variety of curatorial requests. This ongoing program, inaugurated in 1972, continues to experience significant growth. Much interest was generated by the scope and number of special Bicentennial exhibits. Short-term projects, as well as long-term regular assignments, accounted for over forty-eight thousand hours of volunteer service.
The Smithsonian Resident Associate Program was established in 1965 by Secretary Ripley to provide the opportunity for residents of the Greater Washington area to participate actively in the life of the Institution. The purpose of the Program, as defined by Secretary Ripley, is to “serve as a link between what the Institution does, whether in museum or laboratory or art gallery programs or research and publications and what the public in the Washington area can do to participate.” The Program seeks to achieve this goal through an extensive range of quality educational activities that are consonant with the research, collections, and exhibitions of the Institution. These activities include classes in the arts, sciences, humanities, and studio arts; study tours within the Smithsonian bureaus and nearby complementary facilities; lectures; symposia; seminars; film series; exhibition previews; outdoor festivals; art poster projects; and performing arts events.
In striving to provide a quality program of continuing education, the Resident Associate Program seeks to accommodate a rapidly expanding membership that is highly educated, relatively young, and the majority of whom reside in suburban Maryland and nearby Virginia.
As of July 1976, there were 39,500 members, a nearly fivefold increase over the July 1972 figure of 8,500. It was determined that in fiscal 1976, membership growth should not be sought; however, although all promotion was eliminated, unsolicited applications and a high retention rate resulted in a net gain of 5,500 memberships; 13,199 new members joined, and the annual renewal rate was 78.5 percent. The 39,500 memberships represent approximately 85,000 individuals who are single, double, or family members.
The Resident Associate Program marked its Tenth Anniversary in September 1975 with a full day of festivities. To commemorate

this event, Washington artist Gene Davis was commissioned to create a special Resident Associate serigraph and poster. The 200 serigraphs and 1,000 posters were much appreciated by the members, and sold out within a month. The Program donated an artist’s proof of the Gene Davis serigraph to the National Gallery of Art, National Collection of Fine Arts, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Proceeds from the poster sales were used to award tuition-free scholarships, based on need and interest to 339 inner-city students, for attendance at Associate classes; additionally, 38 Smithsonian docents received tuition-free scholarships to classes, and any other docents applying received one-third discount on the class fee.
The Program continued to offer a broad range of lecture classes

for adults in the arts, sciences, and humanities. Taught by Smithsonian and visiting scholars, 108 classes in these areas were scheduled in the four terms of fiscal year 1976, attended by 5,116 individuals. A total of 273 adult classes, including studio courses, photography, and workshops, were given for adults during the year, with an enrollment of 8,075 students. Of the lecture classes, those in archeology, architecture, astronomy, botany, decorative arts, and new courses related to Associate foreign travel were the best attended. The latter represented a series of foreign study courses planned as orientation for participants in Associate trips abroad. These classes were also intended as complete educational experiences in themselves. In the studio arts, photography laboratory courses surpassed all others in number of enrollment. Furnituremaking and restoration, photo-silkscreen, stained-glassmaking, weaving, and calligraphy were also extremely well received.
Through the Trips and Tours branch of the Program, members were given the opportunity to participate in scholarly tours of Smithsonian exhibitions and visits to nearby cultural, historic, or scientific locales. This year, there were 439 on-site learning experiences, 140 of which were free and open to members only. A total of 17,265 individuals participated in these field activities led by Smithsonian or other qualified scholars. Among the most popular tours were those that enabled members to explore facets of the Institution; the “Indoor Field Trips at the National Museum of History and Technology” attracted over 1,200 members; 450 members took guided tours of “The Eye of Thomas Jefferson” exhibition at the National Gallery of Art. In-depth art trips to New York City’s Soho lofts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other New York museums and collections continue to be exceedingly popular, resulting in large overflow lists. Tours to Winterthur and walking tours of the city, Alexandria, Georgetown, Capitol Hill, and Massachusetts Avenue areas were oversubscribed and rescheduled. All tours are limited in size; many have to be repeated as often as twenty-four times to accommodate registrants.
The Special Events segment of the Program includes lectures, seminars, and symposia conducted by distinguished Smithsonian and visiting scholars. Outdoor festivals, film series, and performing arts are also integral. During fiscal year 1976, 100 special events were attended by over 21,000 people. Twenty special events were

offered free to members only. During 1976, the reopening of the restored Arts and Industries Building with its “1876: A Centennial Exhibition” and the opening of the National Air and Space Museum provided opportunities for gala Associate openings. Members were also offered a special private walk-through of the National Museum of History and Technology’s major Bicentennial exhibition, “A Nation of Nations.” An ongoing cooperative venture, the Audubon Lecture Series, sponsored by the Resident Associate Program, the Audubon Naturalist Society, and the Friends of the National Zoo, was overbooked for all of the nine lectures.

The Young Associates program extends the resources of the Institution to members’ children (as well as the scholarship children noted above) through classes and special activities. The program offers learning experiences appropriate to specific age groups, ranging from four to eighteen. Over twenty classes are offered in each of the four academic terms. Special tours of Smithsonian exhibitions and of local cultural, scientific, and historic places of interest are planned for young people, as well as free films, performing arts programs, and courses and workshops. The free annual holiday party served over 1,000 Young Associates. Over 12,000 young people have participated in Young Associate activities during the past year.
Some two hundred and fifty volunteers work for the Resident Associate Program on a regular basis. Their responsibilities vary from assisting at special events to office duties to monitoring classes. A special project undertaken this year by volunteers was the reading of the Associate newsletter for the visually handicapped. Volunteers have also been working with Harold Snider of the National Air and Space Museum on Institution-wide projects to aid the visually impaired.
Smithsonian Institution Press
During the past fifteen months the Smithsonian Institution Press, under new management and with a reorganized and augmented staff, significantly increased its production of Smithsonian-related scholarly books and improved the quality of its performance, following many of the valuable recommendations of the 1975 Boutwell, Crane, Moseley, and Associates Study Report. The staff reorganization and increase enabled the Press to catch up with the impending backlog of a year ago, to meet several short schedules for Bicentennial exhibition catalogues and the generally increased publishing requirements of the Bicentennial, to rejuvenate a promising trade-book publishing activity after a hiatus during the summer of 1975, and to make a promising beginning in correcting a longstanding and unfavorable imbalance in the relationship between sales prices and production costs in its privately funded book publishing. In addition, moving and associated activities occupied a

good deal of the time and attention: the Distribution and Fulfillment Section transferred its base of operations from 24th Street, N.W. to 1111 North Capitol Street, and the editorial, design, production, and administration offices left the Liberty Loan Building to become temporary tenants of the National Museum of Natural History. With one more move, scheduled for November 1976, the Press will occupy permanent quarters in the Arts and Industries Building.
The publication in June of the 1976 Smithsonian Institution Press catalogue with its list of attractive new titles brought a prompt response from the extensive market to which it was distributed, and furnished tangible evidence of the attention the entire Press staff is devoting to these goals. Current best-sellers on the new list are Zoobook, Blue Mystery: The Story of the Hope Diamond, America As Art, The Golden Door, and Official White House China. New books of more specialized scholarly interest included volume 2 of The Papers of Joseph Henry, and The Flora of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands; the Press arranged co-publishing agreements with commercial publishers for books of wide potential appeal, such as The Indian Legacy of Charles Bird King (co-published with Doubleday, Inc.) and The National Watercraft Collection (co-published with International Marine Publishing Co.); and it collaborated with other federal agencies on books of mutual interest, of which recent examples are Worthy of the Nation and The Federal City: Plans and Realities, produced with the cooperation of the National Capital Planning Commission.
Smithsonian Institution Press editors and designers continued to reap laurels in both federal and private competitions and exhibits for the exceptional quality of their productions. Nine members of the Press staff received 1976 National Association of Government Communicators Blue Pencil Awards, with four first, a second, and third prizes in four categories of federal publications. In addition, seven Smithsonian Institution Press publications were placed on exhibit in “Design Response,” the Federal Design Council’s first annual exhibition of outstanding graphic design work performed by federal agencies; two pieces were accepted for display in the annual exhibit of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington, which embraces both governmental and commercial graphic design; and Official White House China was one of only twentyfive publications in the country accepted for the American Associa-

tion of University Presses’ 1976 Bookshow, which is toured nationally.
During the year, production costs of 220 publications were funded by federal appropriations in the amount of $1,224,565; 10 trade publications were supported wholly by Smithsonian trust funds in the amount of $292,826. The Press and the Superintendent of Documents shipped, on order and subscriptions, a total of 6,691,995 publications including books, art catalogues, brochures, and miscellaneous items; 267 records were distributed.
Smithsonian Magazine
Smithsonian magazine joined in the celebration of our nation’s Bicentennial by publishing special articles throughout the year that presented thought-provoking ideas which should be considered within the next few decades. The magazine continued to project the spirit of the Institution to its nationwide audience.
For the past fifteen months, Smithsonian magazine carried its readers from Lake Baikal to Singapore, introduced them to truckers in Alaska and tramps riding freight trains. The American art collection of John D. Rockefeller was viewed as closely as was the Elie Nadelman exhibition in the Smithsonian’s own Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The Smithsonian joins the rest of the Institution in presenting information on history, science, and the arts to the public from its vast store of knowledge.
Along with continuing success in enriching the editorial content of the magazine, Smithsonian increased its membership from 900,000 to 1,250,000.

Smithsonian Year « 1976 ADMINISTRATION
FOLLOWING THE UNTIMELY DEATH of Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, the Secretary established a new position of Assistant Secretary for Administration, to which Mr. John F. Jameson, formerly the Institution’s Budget Officer, was appointed, effective August a, 976,
The Institution’s museums, galleries, research laboratories, and other program activities are served by a number of support activities and financial services which, while operating largely behind the scenes, made significant contributions to program achievements during the Bicentennial period.
Organizations reporting to Mr. Richard L. Ault, Director of Support Activities, included the Management Analysis Office, Office of Equal Opportunity, Office of Computer Services, Office of Facilities Planning and Engineering Services, Office of Personnel Administration, Office of Plant Services, Office of Printing and Photographic Services, Office of Protection Services, Office of Supply Services, Contracts Office, and the Travel Services Office. During the year, significant improvements were made in Support Activities toward providing quality and timely services. A Management by Objectives program, implemented in the previous year, continued to supply participative, results-oriented, objective-setting and review processes.
Mr. T. Ames Wheeler, Treasurer, continued his responsibilities for the financial assets and management of the Institution assisted by the Office of Programming and Budget, Accounting Division, Investment Accounting Division, Grants and Insurance Administration Division, and the Business Management Office (which includes the Museum Shops, Product Development Program, and the Bel-

mont Conference Center). During the year, revised procedures for the entire accounting system were under development to unify federal and trust fund accounting for greater efficiency in data collection and to provide more timely financial information to management at all levels. The Museum Shops opened new shops in the National Air and Space Museum, the Arts and Industries Building, and in the West Court addition to the Natural History Building. Considerable expansion of the Smithsonian’s mail order program occurred, stemming from new museum-related products and the availability of catalogues.
The Smithsonian Institution Women’s Council continued its important efforts to represent the women of the Institution and to promote their welfare. During the year, the Women’s Council presented six programs concerning women’s interests, with particu-

lar emphasis on new laws covering credit, name change, the current standing of the Equal Rights Amendment, and a session on consciousness-raising.
The Council’s annual training seminar was devoted to the Smithsonian’s equal employment opportunity and personnel management programs, the status of women’s programs in other agencies, EEO legislation, and regulations and credit for women.
In addition, this year the Smithsonian Women’s Council established a career training and development program, instituted for the purpose of acquainting members with helpful knowledge which would be conveyed to all Smithsonian employees. Courses were taken in assertiveness, career development, and administrative procedures.

Smithsonian Year + 1976
APPROACHING ITS SIXTH ANNIVERSARY, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, recognized throughout the nation and the world as a scholarly institution of major importance, has become a distinctive, living memorial to a former president.
The Center continued to commemorate, through its residential fellowship program of advanced research and communication, both the intellectual depth and the public concerns of Woodrow Wilson. Providing leadership for first-rate scholarship in the nation’s capital, the Center embodies the humanistic, Wilsonian belief in a fruitful relationship between the world of learning and the world of public affairs.
The Fellows
The thirty-five fellows conducting individual research are the core of the Center. The quality and diversity of the fellows and their published works continue to grow. The number of applications from across the United States and around the world increases each year. As of September 1976, 197 fellowships had been awarded since the Center was established—about 60 percent to American scholars, the rest to applicants from some 32 countries.

<<<Page: 288>>>

During 1976, at one of the regular Tuesday and Friday noontime discussion hours, one might have observed in conversation: the former commander-in-chief of NATO; a former head of state from Latin America; a former foreign minister from Africa; the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London; a professor of comparative literature and culture from Tokyo University; a state senator from Wisconsin; a theologian from the School of Theology at Claremont, California; and a professor of anthropology from Stanford University. In the current year, fellows included thirty-one American college professors from a variety of departments in twenty-five different universities, chosen through open competition.
Drawing on the rich resources of the Library of Congress, National Archives, and other collections of materials often uniquely available in Washington, D.C., the fellows have pursued such varied research projects as:
“The sponsor: his role and influence in American television.”
“History of attitudes toward death in western culture from the middle ages to the present.”
“Authority and inequality in comparative historical perspective.”
“A critical study of civic education as conceived by the founding fathers.”
“Comparative study of western civil and communist revolutionary despotic cultures.”
“A history of the idea of poverty in nineteenth-century England.”
“History of Afro-American attitudes toward Africa.”
“The making of Saudi Arabia, 1902-1953.”
“A history of American trade unionism since 1945.”
“Intelligent citizen participation in the face of growing complexity and certain adverse effects of the media and the present political process.”
“A critical study of regionalism as used in the United States.”
“Renewable natural resources in an age of scarcity and climatic instability: interrelations of ecology and public policy.”
Among the distinguished guest scholars who shared in the life of the Center this year was Fernand Braudel, one of the most eminent historians of his generation. Director of the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme in Paris, and author of the classic The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II (in two volumes), Braudel worked on a sequel to the first volume, Capitalism and Material Life, 1400-1800.

The Program
Fellows at the Center worked within three broadly defined scholarly divisions: Historical and Cultural Studies; Social and Political Studies; and Resources, Environment and Interdependence. A fourth division, the Kennan Institute.for Advanced Russian Studies, was established by decision of the Board of Trustees in December 1974, with former Center fellow George Kennan as head of its academic advisory group and Dr. S. Frederick Starr as its secretary.
The Kennan Institute has launched a program of fellowships and short-term grants, enabling leading scholars from this country and abroad to utilize the unique resources of the Washington area. Simultaneously, the Institute has organized conferences, colloquia, and seminars which bring together leading specialists from academia, government, business, and the press to consider significant issues involving Russia, past and present. Three film series also have been arranged, at which little-known works of Soviet cinema are presented and discussed, often for the first time in this country.
Like the Center as a whole, the Kennan Institute’s policy is to receive and offer hospitality to those engaged in fundamental research anywhere in the world. To this end, it maintains regular scholarly contact with leading university centers for Russian studies in this country and with scholarly groups in Europe, Japan, and the U.S.S.R. As these contacts broaden, and as the fellowship and seminar programs gain momentum, the Center’s new institute is expected to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the Soviet Union.
The Center has no permanent faculty or restrictive departmental barriers within its interdisciplinary body. “Clusters” of scholars, however, often have formed around topics of major importance and mutual interest. For example, the problems of state and local government, of the ocean, food, the impact of the visual media (movies and television), and ethnicity have been subjects of informal groupings; and there is a continuing concern for studies of the institutions of American government.
Recognizing the importance of Inter-American relations, as well as the special resources in Washington, D.C. for research in this area, in 1976 the Center prepared to embark on a new three-year

program in Latin American affairs. The program will bring together a group of Latin American scholars working individually on regional research. Programmatic focus for many of the meetings will be provided by a major study of United States-Latin American economic relationships, of which Dr. Abraham F. Lowenthal, director of the program at the Center, will be a principal author.
A variety of seminars, conferences, and colloquia will complement the work under way and will involve a broad community of scholars,

practitioners, and commentators. Special support for this program is expected from the Tinker, Ford, Rockefeller, and Kettering Foundations; the Rockefeller Brothers’ Fund; the Organization of American States; the United States Department of State; and the Smithsonian Institution.
The Communicating
The Center’s effort to carry out its mandate to communicate with a wider public took a major step forward in October 1976, with the publication of the first issue of The Wilson Quarterly, a 160-page “national review of ideas and information.” The Quarterly is designed to provide educated Americans with a continuing overview of scholarly thinking on “basic social, political, economic, and intellectual issues.” The initial press run was 80,000 copies.
The Quarterly’s editors, led by Peter Braestrup, a distinguished and experienced journalist (Time, the New York Times, the Washington Post) and former fellow, draw on the talents and judgments of the Center’s fellows and former fellows, as well as on authorities at leading universities. The editors seek fresh thinking and clear writing from noted specialists across America and in major research centers overseas.
The magazine contains five sections. First, there is a broad review of significant articles from a wide spectrum of some four hundred journals, ranging from Public Opinion Quarterly to Orbis to Renaissance. Then come several essays on special topics, ranging in one issue from Soviet affairs to the American family. Each group of essays is reenforced by a review-essay of background books in the relevant field. A section devoted to “current books,” on a variety of scholarly subjects, comes next, with listings of new books by fellows and former fellows. Special reports on current scholarly research in various fields and occasional reprints of significant articles or studies from the past complete the Quarterly’s offerings.
The magazine’s initial publication was made possible by the assistance of the Smithsonian Institution and by grants from individuals, foundations, and corporations. Its circulation and promotion effort is managed under contract by the Smithsonian magazine

business staff. The Quarterly, like the Center itself, encourages diversity of viewpoint and scholarly method.
In still another effort to serve a broader public, the Center is preparing to publish a series of Guides for scholars to resources in the libraries and archives, both federal and private, in the Washington area. Each Guide will be prepared by a scholar who has done research in some of the Washington collections. The Center has received a grant from the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation for the printing of four of the Guides. The first one, covering the resources for Russian and Soviet studies, by Dr. Steven Grant, assistant professor of history and international relations at George Washington University, was nearly completed in 1976. Other Guides on Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America, and the resources for the study of film and television are planned for future publication.
In other forums, the fellows communicate the results of their research to each other, to fellow specialists, and to interested and concerned leaders of both public and private sectors in Washington and throughout the nation.
A major goal of the Center is that each fellow’s study project results in a published work, such as the book by former fellow Elliot Richardson, entitled The Creative Balance: Government, Politics and the Individual in America’s Third Century, which came out this year. Scores of magazine articles and monographs also emanate from work originating at the Center.
Preluncheon discussions are held at noon every Tuesday and Friday, providing an opportunity for dialogue among the fellows and with distinguished guests from the Congress, from other parts of the government, and from the private sector.
Late-afternoon colloquia on works in progress are led by fellows at some point in their stay here. Informed commentary, either by other fellows or by outside specialists, is invited, and critical discussion centers on key ideas, with a view to improving and sharpening the focus of the work.
Evening dialogues, sustained by a grant from the Xerox Corporation, are held on topics of major interest and importance every other week or so. From thirty to thirty-five guests with special interest in the topic are invited from leading scholarly and public institutions,
282 / Smithsonian Year 1976

and after dialogue among two or three specially qualified participants, and dinner, the discussion is opened up to all the participants, who have included a number of Senators, Congressmen, cabinet and subcabinet officers, and specialists throughout the Washington
community.

Smithsonian Year + 1976
When ConcRrESS VOTED in 1958 to establish a national center for the performing arts in the city of Washington, it envisioned a vital institution that would serve as a showcase for the finest programs of music, dance, and drama from this country and abroad; stimulate the integration of the arts with the American educational process; and serve as a catalyst for the advancement of the arts throughout the United States. In designating the Center as a living memorial to President Kennedy in 1964, Congress and the Executive Branch reaffirmed the desire that the institution become a major force for the enrichment of American life.
It is both gratifying and encouraging that in only five years of actual operation, the Center has gained international recognition as one of the most successful performing arts institutions of its kind. Thousands of the world’s foremost performing artists, writers, composers, conductors, choreographers, directors, and designers have contributed to a new creative environment; enthusiastically supportive audiences have been developed; and arts programs have been designed to reach into all areas of the country.
Since the first preview performance of Leonard Bernstein’s Mass, on September 6, 1971, nearly eight million people have attended more than 5,100 major performances, including 2,932 performances of drama and musical comedy, 637 performances of dance, 771 symphony concerts, 244 opera performances, 155 recitals, 132

<<<Page: 296>>>

choral concerts, 82 concerts of chamber music, and 234 concerts of popular music. During the past year alone, audience attendance exceeded 1.75 million, an average of 85 percent of capacity, and made the Center the envy of the performing arts world.
Performing Arts Programming
The Center’s fifth theater season proved its most challenging and successful to date. A generous grant from Xerox Corporation enabled the Center, for the first time, to develop and produce an entire theatrical season, without reliance upon outside producers. Under the guidance of a distinguished advisory panel, headed by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., an American Bicentennial Theater Season was organized to recognize outstanding achievement within the American theater during the past 200 years. The series of plays provided an overview of the development of theater in this country and the development of American life and thought as they were reflected upon the stage.
Included in the Bicentennial Theater Season were Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth, starring Elizabeth Ashley, Alfred Drake, and Martha Scott; Percy MacKaye’s The Scarecrow, with William Atherton, Barbara Baxley, and Leonard Frey; William Inge’s Summer Brave, with Alexis Smith; Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth, with Irene Worth and Christopher Walken; The Royal Family, by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, starring Rosemary Harris, Eva Le Gallienne, and George Grizzard; Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey Into Night, with Jason Robards, Zoe Caldwell, and Michael Moriarty; Rip Van Winkle, with Anthony Quayle; The Heiress, by Ruth and Augustus Goetz from Henry James’s novel Washington Square, starring Jane Alexander and Richard Kiley; and Emmet Lavery’s The Magnificent Yankee, starring James Whitmore and Audra Lindley. Irene Worth received Broadway’s Tony Award for her shattering performance in Sweet Bird of Youth, and Ellis Rabb was similarly honored for his direction of The Royal Family.
The Center also produced and presented three plays by the major contemporary American playwright, Preston Jones. Separately en-

titled The Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia, The Oldest Living Graduate and Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander and collectively termed A Texas Trilogy; the plays were presented in an unprecedented eleven-performance-per-week repertory and acclaimed by critics and audiences alike. The three productions were directed by Alan Schneider and presented by an acting ensemble, headed by Fred Gwynn and Diane Ladd. Trilogy broke previous Eisenhower Theater records with a total of 156 performances.
The Center’s success and the reputation of Washington audiences have prompted the nation’s leading theatrical producers to seek out any available booking periods. Inasmuch as the ““musical” is recognized as this country’s most unique contribution to the performing arts, it was appropriate that the Center should play host to a series of new musical productions and major musical revivals during the Bicentennial year.
Among the new productions appearing on the Opera House stage were Musical Jubilee, produced by The Theatre Guild, with a cast that included John Raitt, Tammy Grimes, and Cyril Ritchard; Harold Prince’s production, Pacific Overtures, with music by Stephen Sondheim; and Rex, produced by Richard Adler, with Nicol Williamson as King Henry VIII and music by Richard Rodgers. Pearl Bailey closed her long show-business career with a farewell engagement of Hello, Dolly!, presented by Robert Cherin, and Zero Mostel recreated the role of Tevye in a splendid revival of Fiddler on the Roof, in which the Kennedy Center participated as a coproducer with The Shubert Organization and Nederlander Productions.
A generous Bicentennial grant from the Prudential Insurance Company of America enabled the Center to develop and present a spirited musical celebration, Sing, America, Sing, which traced the history of the United States through its music.
One of the most encouraging recent trends in the performing arts has been the increased public support of dance and the strengthening of American dance companies. During its Bicentennial season, the Center presented return engagements of two of this country’s
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts / 287

foremost dance organizations, The American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet. The acclaimed Alvin Ailey City Center Dance Theater also returned to the Opera House under the sponsorship of the Washington Performing Arts Society.
In its role as a showcase for the presentation of outstanding performing organizations from other countries, the Center also sponsored engagements of Britain’s Royal Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the Australian Ballet.
The Center’s 1975-1976 opera season offered a spectacular series of productions by five of the world’s leading companies. During a fifteen-month period, the Center presented a total of seventy-seven performances of twenty-five different works.
The Bolshoi Opera engagement, in July 1975, featured productions of Boris Godunov, War and Peace, Eugene Onegin, Pique Dame, The Gambler, and a contemporary work, The Dawns Are Quiet Here. The Berlin Opera followed in November with Lohengrin, Tosca, and Cosi Fan Tutte.
The New York City Opera’s fifth annual Kennedy Center engagement included productions of The Ballad of Baby Doe, The Barber of Seville, Un Ballo in Maschera, La Bohéme, Cavalleria Rusticana, I Pagliacci, and special performances of Lucrezia Borgia, with Beverly Sills singing the title role.
With the combined assistance of the Italian Government, the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, Philip Morris, Garfinckel’s, Local 22 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and the Metropolitan Opera Guild, the Center presented the first American engagement of the legendary Teatro alla Scala of Milan. Appearing only at the Center, La Scala treated capacity audiences to productions of Macbetto, La Bohéme, Simon Boccanegra, and La Cenerentola, and to a concert presentation of the Verdi Requiem.
Completing the season were Paris Opera productions of Otello, Le Nozze di Figaro and Faust. The Paris Opera Chorus and Orchestra also presented two choral masterworks, The Damnation of Faust and Requiem, by Hector Berlioz.
Other Center-sponsored musical events included a series of performances by the Philadelphia Orchestra; a Chamber Music Festi-

val, featuring such performers as Isaac Stern, Pinchas Zukerman, Eugene Istomin, and Leonard Rose; and a memorable concert— tribute to W. C. Handy.
Vitally important to the musical year were the scores of performances presented and sponsored by Washington arts organizations. The Center’s resident National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Antal Dorati, presented a season of 137 concerts. The Washington Performing Arts Society brought to the Concert Hall outstanding performances by major world orchestras and recital artists. The Opera Society of Washington presented three major productions: L’Italiana in Algeri, Otello, and Thais. And, the Choral Arts Society, the Paul Hill Chorale, and the Oratorio Society of Washington performed many of the world’s great choral works.
The Center also welcomed independently presented productions of Scott Joplin’s Treemonisha, John Philip Sousa’s El Capitan, and Britain’s D’Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Operating within the Kennedy Center under a separate administration, the American Film Institute has brought more than 600 films and nearly 100,000 moviegoers to the Center during the past year. The 224-seat art Theater has become one of the world’s most respected repertory film theaters, and its programs include retrospectives of the works of important filmmakers, the films of a particular country, and highlights of a certain period or genre. Among the 1976 series were “Americana,” the Soviet Silent Cinema, Opera on Film, new films from Egypt, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Iran, and series-tributes to William Wyler, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, Carole Lombard, Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers. The ari also presented an educational film-lecture series and matinees of classic films for children.
Appearing personally in connection with special film presentations were such stars as James Stewart, Liv Ullman, and Cicely Tyson; directors, including Martin Scorsese, Elia Kazan, Satyajit Ray, Marcel Ophuls, Louis Malle, and Joan Micklin Silver; and producers Sam Spiegel and David Brown.
More than 26,000 people attended a special Bicentennial Film Series presented by the National Park Service in the art Theater each day from April 26th through Labor Day. In addition, the

<<<Page: 300>>>

Theater hosted such special events as the Washington National Student Film Festival and the International Women’s Film Festival.
The ari Theater is supported by ticket revenue, a major grant from the Cafritz Foundation, and fund-raising benefits organized by the Fans of AFI.
A glittering array of talent gathered on January 25, 1976, to honor Center-Chairman Roger L. Stevens in a “Bicentennial Salute to the Performing Arts.” Among those who performed on the Opera House stage, before an audience that included President and Mrs. Ford, were Marian Anderson, Pearl Bailey, Carol Channing, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Henry Fonda, Tammy Grimes, Robert Hooks, Judith Jamison, Priscilla Lopez, Martha Scott, Isaac Stern, Edward Villella, Allegra Kent, and Pinchas Zukerman. The gala performance benefitted the Center’s Performing Arts Programming Fund.
Public Service Programming
In addition to its performance programming, the Center has undertaken an extensive program of educational and public service activities, and during the fifteen-month period ending September 30, 1976, nearly one million people attended 1,491 different free events. Symposia, focusing upon all areas of the performing arts and drawing upon the expertise of many of the performers appearing at the Center, are presented on a regular basis by the Friends of the Kennedy Center, in cooperation with the National Park Service, the National Symphony Orchestra, and the American Film Institute. The Friends also sponsor weekly demonstration-lectures that explain the workings of the Concert Hall’s Filene Memorial Organ and feature recitals by Washington-area organists.
The Center’s 1975 holiday festival, “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” featured forty free programs staged throughout the building. The festival, made possible by the continued support of Mobil Oil Corporation, included the “Messiah Sing In,” one of the most popular annual events. ‘““The Spring Festival of American Music,” sponsored by McDonald’s Corporation, offered thirty-three free concerts representing the spectrum of America’s musical heritage.

The Center’s Bicentennial exhibition, “America on Stage: 200 will continue through December 31, 1976. Sponsored by a grant from IBM Corporation, “America on
Years of Performing Arts,
Stage” occupies more than 20,000 square feet of the Roof Terrace level and focuses upon the evolution of American drama, music, and dance from the colonial period to the present. Located in the exhibition area is a 230-seat theater in the form of a replica of a Chautauqua Tent. Since the exhibition opened in January, the Tent has housed more than one hundred free performances, including a special Center-sponsored summer series, Three Portraits in Repertory by Eugenia Rawls.
Free performances are frequently presented at the Center in conjunction with regular programing activities. During September and October 1975, the Center collaborated with the National Symphony, the Washington Performing Arts Society, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Library of Congress to produce a three-week festival and musicological conference celebrating the monumental career of Joseph Haydn. In addition to a major series of Haydn performances in the Opera House and Concert Hall, ten of the twelve Haydn Masses were presented to the public in the Grand Foyer.
The National Music Council is currently sponsoring an eighteenmonth-long series of free State Day concerts. The series celebrates music written by composers from each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia and features programs performed in the Grand Foyer and Concert Hall by solo artists and musical groups from each state. Termed “A Bicentennial Parade of American Music,” the series is administered by the National Federation of Music Clubs and funded by a grant from Exxon.
The Center also hosts Mobil Oil Corporation’s “National Town Meeting” series. The National Town Meetings provide a unique opportunity for direct interaction between the public and national policyand opinion-makers.
From July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976, 166,833 tickets for regular Center performances were distributed at half-price through the Specially Priced Ticket Program. This Program was designed by the Center to make its performances accessible to all, regardless of economic circumstances, and is available to students, the handi-

capped, senior citizens, military personnel in the lower grades, and low-income groups. The sale of these Specially Priced Tickets represented a total price-reduction of $841,041 for the fifteen-month period.
In 1973, the Center joined with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to establish the national Alliance for Arts Education (AAE). The ade is dedicated to incorporating the arts into the educational experience of each child and to fostering greater cooperation between established arts organizations and educational institutions. AAE committees have been established within each state to assist in the implementation of specific state arts programs.
During March 1976, the AaE sponsored a six-day Youth Music Festival with performances throughout the Center. Thirty-five student groups, representing twenty-one states, performed for a total audience that exceeded ten thousand. The aae also sponsors arts workshops for teachers and school administrators and administers an ongoing internship program designed to acquaint students with basic arts administration skills through involvement in Center operations.
Currently, the aat is presenting a twenty-eight-week Children’s Arts Series, with specially designed children’s programs performed at the Center by professional groups. The programs are participatory in nature and include music, dance, theater, mime, poetry, and puppetry. Performances are offered free of charge on Fridays and Saturdays and are designed to reach a total audience of more than thirty-six thousand children during the twenty-eight-week period. The Series is intended to culminate in a major Children’s Arts Festival in 1977.
The American College Theatre Festival, presented annually by the Kennedy Center and the Alliance for Arts Education, provides recognition to the 2,300 college and university theaters throughout the country and the more than 50,000 students enrolled in formal classes in theater arts. More than 10,000 college and university productions are presented in the United States each year, and the Festival seeks to honor the best of these, strengthen the rest, and
292 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 303>>>

encourage students everywhere to take an active part in theater as writers, designers, performers, directors, and/or audiences.
From a series of regional festivals in which more than 350 schools participated, seven productions were selected for presentation in a national showcase at the Center in April. The Festival Program also included special awards designed to recognize and encourage individual excellence in performing and playwriting. In its eighth year, the Theatre Festival was sponsored by amoco Oil Company and produced by the American Theatre Association.
Friends of the Kennedy Center
Organized as the Center’s official auxiliary in 1966, the Friends of the Kennedy Center have established an extraordinary record of service to all phases of Center operations.
Long before the Center opened, the Friends staffed a visitor information trailer at the construction site and sent speakers into all parts of the country to explain and promote the Center project. The Friends co-sponsored the first American College Theatre Festival and in so doing helped to establish one of the Center’s most significant educational traditions. Before the Center had taken on a recognizable structural form, the Friends were actively organizing arts projects for Washington-area school children and sparking the imagination of children through the “Tom Sawyer” constructionfence-painting project.
Under the chairmanship of Mrs. Polk Guest, the Friends now number nearly ten thousand from all fifty states and several foreign countries. Included in the membership are 300 active volunteers whose combined contribution to the Center totals nearly 80,000 hours each year. The volunteer office, which serves as a major information and assistance center for visitors, is staffed 365 days a year from 9:30 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. More than 400,000 visitors participate each year in tours of the building conducted by volunteer guides. For the benefit of foreign visitors, tours are available in Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Italian, and Hebrew.
The Friends also administer the Center’s Specially Priced Ticket Program, manage its souvenir stands, coordinate special arrangements for handicapped visitors and theatergoers, provide staff as-

<<<Page: 304>>>

sistance to the Center’s mail-order department, assist with logistics for the National Symphony Orchestra’s children’s concerts, and respond to tens of thousands of written requests for Center information. During the past year, the Friends have also provided invaluable assistance in staffing the “America on Stage” exhibition each day from 10:15 a.o. until 8:15 P.M.
The Friends work closely with the National Park Service, which is responsible for maintaining the Center as a national memorial, and, from July 1, 1975, through September 30, 1976, the Friends and Park Service personnel helped to provide information assistance and hospitality to more than 5.8 million visitors.
Funding
The Center receives no Federal funding for its programming, public service, and administrative expenses, which totaled $15,639,582 for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 1976, and is solely dependent upon revenue from theater operations, concessions income, and private contributions. In addition, the Center reimburses the National Park Service a pro-rata share of annual maintenance costs, on the basis of a formula devised by independent accountants for the House Public Works Committee. For the period July 1, 1975, through June 30, 1976, this reimbursement amounted to $485,440.
Grants from the American business community enabled the Center to develop one of the most successful Bicentennial efforts in the nation. In a special White House gathering on July 8, 1975, President Ford praised the Center’s Bicentennial programming and paid tribute to the generosity of its corporate sponsors. Corporate grants specifically designated for Bicentennial projects were received from amoco Oil Company, Exxon Corporation, 18M Corporation, McDonald’s Corporation, Mobil Oil Corporation, Philip Morris, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, and Xerox Corporation.
During the past fifteen months, the Center has also received substantial aid from the following corporations and foundations: American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.; Alcoa Foundation; American Telephone and Telegraph Company; Atlantic Richfield Company; the Louis D. Beaumont Foundation; Bethlehem Steel Corporation; the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation; Canteen Cor-

people of Japan to the people of the United States will provide the Center with a 600-seat facility designed for chamber music, experimental drama, and poetry. The Theater located on the Roof Terrace level, is expected to be completed in 1978.
Other national gifts included a bronze and stone sculpture, Don Quixote, by Aurelio Teno, presented by King Juan Carlos IJ of Spain; a white porcelain relief by Inge-Lise Koefoed, presented by Queen Margrethe of Denmark; a 4,600-year-old alabaster vase from the government of Egypt, presented by Mrs. Anwar Sadat; and two tapestries, ‘Poem to Fire I and II,” by Leonardo Nierman, presented by the government of Mexico.
Board of Trustees
Although organizationally a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, the Center is administered separately by a 45-member Board of Trustees composed of thirty members appointed by the President of the United States to ten-year overlapping terms and fifteen members ex officio from pertinent government agencies, the Senate, and the House of Representatives.
On October 5, 1976, President Ford announced the reappointment of Roger L. Stevens and Jack J. Valenti and named as new Center trustees Mrs. Howard H. Baker, Jr., Robert S. Carter, Orval Hansen, Mrs. Bob Hope, and John G. Spatuzza.
After serving the Center for eighteen years as Trustee and General Counsel, Ralph E. Becker resigned from the Board to assume new duties as United States Ambassador to Honduras.
Members of the Board of Trustees as of October 20, 1976, are as follows:
Roger L. Stevens, Chairman Abe Fortas

Smithsonian Year + 1976 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART
Tue Nationat GALtery oF Art, although formally established as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, is an autonomous and separately administered organization. It is governed by its own Board of Trustees, the statutory members of which are the Chief Justice of the United States, Chairman; the Secretary of State; the Secretary of the Treasury; and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, all ex officio; and five general trustees. Paul Mellon continued as president of the Gallery and John Hay Whitney as vice president. The other general trustees continuing to serve were Carlisle H. Humelsine and Dr. Franklin D. Murphy. In September 1975, Mr. Stoddard M. Stevens resigned after eight years as a trustee; Mr. John R. Stevenson of New York City was elected to succeed him.
During the fifteen-month period ending September 30, 1976, the Gallery counted 2,210,813 visitors.
A number of important works of art were acquired. The most significant purchase was the painting Lavender Mist by Jackson Pollock. Done in 1950, this work is deemed one of the key works of the artist’s classical period. It will be displayed to the public when the East Building is opened in 1978. Notable among paintings donated were Copley’s portrait of Harrison Gray and Tavern Scene by the Flemish artist David Teniers II.
Eight works of sculpture were added to the collection, including Clodion’s spirited terra-cotta model for the famous marble group Poetry and Music in the Kress Collection and Elie Nadelman’s fine plaster relief, Two Nudes.
Among the 634 works of graphic art acquired were 51 drawings,

<<<Page: 310>>>

including an Ingres portrait and Bird Perched on a Branch with Fruit by Mantegna, 17 Homer watercolors, and prints by Altdorfer, Gainsborough, Delacroix, Pissarro, and de Kooning. A major donation of 160 prints, 30 drawings, and 2 illustrated books by the most prominent contemporary American artists was added to the Gallery’s modern collection.
Twelve exhibitions were offered by the Gallery during the period. “Master Paintings from The Hermitage and The State Russian Museum” afforded viewers a selection of thirty of the old masters as well as a dozen works by nineteenth-century Russian artists little known to Americans. A small but representative display of Goya’s paintings in the Prado marked the visit of King Juan Carlos to the United States.
Two major exhibitions were mounted after years of gestation as the Gallery’s contribution to the Bicentennial. The first, “The European Vision of America,” done in conjunction with the Cleveland Museum of Art, sought to convey the impact of the discovery and opening of the Western Hemisphere on the visual arts of Europe from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries. The second exhibition, ““The Eye of Thomas Jefferson,” in a sense the reverse of the first, surveyed the impact of the classical and European heritage of art, architecture, literature, and music on Jefferson, that most nearly omniscient of the Founding Fathers. A full list of exhibitions is noted at the close of this section.
From its collections, the Gallery made loans to thirty-nine exhibitions at fifty-two institutions including fourteen abroad. Among works lent were seventy-seven paintings, four sculptures, ninetysix graphics, two oriental rugs, and one tapestry.
The Department of Extension Programs continued to make progress in revising existing audiovisual materials and developed and field-tested two new formats designed to enhance the classroom teaching of art history. These included texts, cassettes, slides, film, and reproductions. Total bookings of all programs were 35,608, an increase, on an annual basis, of 9 percent. The total estimated audience in all fifty states and foreign countries was 3,033,127. Another educational program, Art and Man, published in cooperation with Scholastic Magazines, Inc., reached over 3,500 classrooms in every state.
Total attendance at talks given by the Gallery’s Education De-

partment and at the programs presented in the auditorium was 131,654. These included the regularly scheduled auditorium lectures and films; the Introduction to the Collection, the Tour of the Week, and Painting of the Week talks; as well as special introductory presentations keyed to three of the exhibitions. There were thirtythree guest lecturers including the twenty-fourth annual Andrew W. Mellon Lecturer in the Fine Arts, Peter von Blanckenhagen, who gave a series of six lectures entitled ‘““Aspects of Classical Art.” Other distinguished scholars who lectured included Rosamond Bernier, Philip Hofer, and Sir Francis Watson, the Kress Professor in Residence.
The Conservation staff undertook major restoration on twelve paintings and minor treatment on fifty. A major research project on all the Gallery’s twenty-three Rembrandts was initiated and will continue for several years. The Chief Conservator accompanied the return of the “Exhibition of Archaeological Finds” to the People’s Republic of China. Important work was also performed on the graphics and textile collections.
The Research Project at the Carnegie-Mellon Institute of Research continued the study of the properties of both natural and synthetic varnishes and solvents therefor, and produced several publications. Additional projects dealt with deteriorating effects of light on artists’ materials including yarns used for repairing tapestries. Work continued on ten monographs on artists’ pigments.
The most noteworthy acquisition of the Library was the collection of nearly five hundred volumes belonging to Wolfgang Stechow and donated by Mrs. Stechow. More than 4,000 other books and pamphlets were received. The Photographic Archives acquired over 165,000 photographs, of which 108,869 were purchased through funds donated by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.
The sales facilities, including special catalogue desks at exhibitions, handled 343,768 over-the-counter orders and 6,689 mail orders.
In the Music Program, forty-one concerts were presented in the East Garden Court. The National Gallery Orchestra supplied the music at the eighteenth-century fireworks that inaugurated “The Eye of Thomas Jefferson” exhibition in June and represented the District of Columbia in the Parade of the States series at the Kennedy Center. In a closing salute to the Jefferson exhibition, the

Café opened in June 1976 in the Concourse beneath the Plaza, both of which will connect the new East Building with the present National Gallery of Art.
Orchestra Sinfonica Scarlatti di Napoli performed in the East Garden Court as an official gift of the Government of Italy.
The period under review witnessed impressive developments on the construction site to the east of the National Gallery’s original building. In the summer of 1975, the East Building appeared little more than half completed; but by the end of the summer of 1976, all the exterior walls had risen to their full height and were covered with marble, and the giant frame for the skylight over the central court was in place. In addition, the construction of the Concourse linking the two buildings was completed, the Plaza above it was paved, and the Gallery grounds were relandscaped to Fourth Street. In late June, the public was welcomed to the 600-seat Café/Buffet in the Concourse; the new sales area offering a wide choice of art books was opened at the end of August. During the fifteen months,
302 / Smithsonian Year 1976

<<<Page: 313>>>

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation made grants in support of this expansion program totalling $10 million.
During the spring of 1976, rapid progress was made in remodeling of the Fourth Street entrance to the original Gallery building with a new east doorway and a Main Floor balcony overlooking the Plaza and the Lobby. A large Aubusson tapestry based on Jean Arp’s Aubette mural was given by the Collector’s Committee and displayed on the landing of the escalator leading to the Concourse. This was the first work of art commissioned and completed in connection with the new building program.
