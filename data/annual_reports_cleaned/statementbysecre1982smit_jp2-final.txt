FRONTISPIECE: With the completion of the Smithsonian’s Quadrangle project serving our public and Associates alike, a new dimension in America’s comprehension of the non-Western world will be opened on the Mall. Exhibitions, performances, seminars, and discussions will enhance America’s understanding of this panorama of nations harboring two-thirds of the planet’s population. Shown are (left to right) a Korean musician, students in a seminar, a Kutiyattam performer from Kerala, India, young visitors being introduced to African life and art, and Smithsonian Associates visiting the Treasury Building in Petra, Jordan.

The Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

Know Thy Neighbor as Thyself
THIS PARAPHRASE OF THE BIBLE saying, “Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself,” a true saying, and one to be emulated if in larger affairs it had not a mocking ring, is one that I often think of in connection with the Smithsonian. To know is to learn but also to give a little. If one knows anything it is a scrap of learning. Every scrap should be shared for all bear upon a central theme. The assemblage of knowledge is like a pyramid. Its creation is the very abnegation of self, and in the process we learn to know each other, more sanely, I believe, than love would ever let us do, clouded with the mists of sentiment or tears, as that may be.
Speaking at the dedication of the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 1874, Professor Joseph Henry, first Secretary of the Smithsonian, stated that James Smithson’s memorial,
“pace =
eg atc 7 a a re

<<<Page: 13>>>

the Institution, should be a work place, a “college of discoverers,” a haven for research, “discovering new facts, new phenomena and new principles,” and making this information known to all. Knowledge should be spread abroad by museums based on this research. This is the finest memorial of all, for “what, in comparison to this, are local monuments, pyramids of flint, statues of brass or obelisks of marble!”
These two generations past have been the generations of self, on which mountains of egocentrism have been erected, eroding over the years, as always, in the sands of anomie and the washings of self-pity. I went to Persepolis not long ago and walked over the desert into the blue silk and damask tents erected to celebrate two thousand five hundred years of a dynasty that never was. Created with cunning skill by French decorators for the nonevent, the tents still stood, the curtains giving way at one’s entrance to the great banquet pavillion; within, a crescent-shaped dias with a crescent table, backed by a row of pale blue velvet tall chairs arranged on one side only, not for conversation but for the admiration of the courtiers and press. No sound broke the spell except for a faint soughing of the wind, which made the gilt candelabra sway slightly in a ghostly reverie. Oh, Ozymandias have you told us nothing?
The accumulation of knowledge must not be a selfish thing, for knowledge and learning go hand in hand, and to learn is to teach. James Smithson in his charge to his heirs—his administrators for the future—said that his Institution should serve for “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men” (i.e., mankind). One of my colleagues, Wilcomb Washburn, has recently discovered a letter of Smithson’s in French, addressed to Baron Georges Cuvier, the most celebrated French savant of his day, written from Germany in 1806, twenty years before Smithson’s death, in which he presaged the language of his famous will. A translation might be, “It seems to me, Sir, that the man of genius who through important discoveries expands the scope of the human mind is entitled to something beyond a mere and fruitless admiration

<<<Page: 14>>>

being for all nations, they themselves should be looked upon as citizens of mankind.”
It seems to me that what Smithson is writing is that as scientists or scholars of history or art at the Smithsonian, we are obligated to increase and diffuse knowledge, and in the process sweep away the cobwebs of self-pity, deriving satisfaction not from selfpromotion but rather from the rewarding tasks of increasing and diffusing knowledge. We must reach what we know and discover, as best we can, using research as a tool for illumination.
The Smithsonian Institution is embarking on a course which, if successful, will lead to an expansion on an international scale of our motto. For perhaps the first time in our history, we are embarking in a spirit of social responsibility on a creative effort to increase understanding and respect for our neighbors.
One of our mandates, the diffusion of knowledge among men (among mankind) works both ways, within and without. We can, for example, tell Americans about their history, but how can we extend that to tell Americans about the history of the rest of the world, especially about those parts and nations of which we are still so woefully ignorant. Our entire awareness of others has been concentrated until recently on the so-called Western world: Europe —extending east to Russia, south to the Mediterranean—and parts of Latin American, our traditional neighbors. Until World War II, Asia was known to relatively few Americans. Few Americans penetrated beyond Japan and China. The vast worlds of more southern Asia (except for the Philippines), tropical Asia, the southwest Pacific areas (except for Australia), and Africa and the Middle East were essentially little-known and beyond most people’s means to visit or experience.
Now this Institution has an opportunity to combine objects, collections such as those in the Freer Gallery of Art, the National Museum of African Art, collections in our kindred departments of Anthropology and History and Art, into our Quadrangle, a new Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures, to be built south of the original Smithsonian Castle. This Center will delineate to Americans as well as to the world the necessity to “know your neighbor,’ to respect our fellow inhabitants in this shrinking world, and in the process generate an increased measure of self-respect in ourselves and in our neighbors as well. Traditions and cultures

universal phenomenon of celebration and demostrates how different people mark the important events and cycles in their societies. The exhibition includes approximately 600 objects—95 percent of which have never before been exhibited—from more than 60 cultures and the collections of 9 Smithsonian museums. A related exhibition was presented later in the year at the National Museum of African Art: Life . . . Afterlife: African Funerary Sculpture, which examines the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, and afterlife experienced by many African cultures. Other notable exhibitions included two companion shows at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden—Raphael Soyer: 65 Years of Printmaking and Soyer Since 1960—honoring the very substantial output of this talented artist and contributor to the museum’s collections. The Hirshhorn was also host to the De Stijl: 1917-1931, Visions of Utopia exhibition, illuminating the art, architecture, and design of the influential Dutch movement that was characterized by elementary, geometric forms and pure, primary colors. The exhibition was one of several international events marking the two-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and The Netherlands, the longest peaceful relationship the United States has had with any foreign power.
Further reflecting significant international influences in art and design, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum opened in September a retrospective view of the history of Scandinavian design during the last 100 years, which included furniture, glass, ceramics, metal work, and textiles as part of a national celebration of “Scandinavia Today.” |
A selection from the Meserve Collection of the original glass plate negatives of Mathew Brady’s portrait photographs were exhibited for the first time in May at the National Portrait Gallery in a specially designed room, evocative of the mid-nineteenth century. This unique collection of immense historical importance also includes the only print ever made from the last photograph of President Lincoln. Perhaps the most haunting likeness of Lincoln, it was taken on April 10, 1865, in a studio four blocks south of the Portrait Gallery building just four days before his assassination.
During the past year our colleagues in the physical and natural sciences also have made lively and important contributions in exhibitions as well as in research. Of the former, perhaps the most

business manager, who have left for the vineyards of private industry. We have been fortunate to be able to promote Jacqueline Austin to the helm of the National Associates, Ann Bay to the head of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Joe Chmelik to business manager.
At the same time we should note two nearly simultaneous arrivals at the old Patent Office Building. Alan Fern, formerly of the Library of Congress, has been named director of the National Portrait Gallery, and Charles Eldredge, the former director of the Spencer Museum of Art in Lawrence, Kansas, has assumed the directorship of the National Museum of American Art. I am confident these two innovative and sensitive scholars will lead their programs in imaginative ways and in the spirit of partnership.
If the pursuit of knowledge is the aim of this Institution, then we can look forward to an enlarging era in the programs planned for the future of our new Center described in the opening of this statement. Americans long to be friends with all the world. We are frustrated by those who fail to understand that we hope that our civilization, our history of democracy and freedom is a real one, in spite of the ups and downs of our progress. If James Smithson had a vision—that somewhere across the ocean from the Europe of stratified hierarchies and iron-bound convention of the eighteenth century, this new world could achieve such an ideal—we could hardly deny that that vision was proleptic. It is in the fulfillment of that ambition of our precursor that we must proceed.
There is a time in the world for the realization of these ambitions. The eagle on the Great Seal may have arrows or thunderbolts clutched in one set of claws, but there is an olive branch in the other. Justice and equality demand that America be strong and competent in the role of peace-keeper, but peace itself demands understanding, friendship, and mutual self-respect, hand in hand with certainty. Respect above all for cultures and traditions across the face of that great arc of the world stretching from Atlantic to Pacific, from Africa to East Asia, should insure that we can “know our neighbors as ourselves,” and in this knowing, learn to respect and live with new friends for the future. For indeed there is no other choice.

standards of conduct; museum security; Smithsonian procedures for construction and repair services; and computer services.
The Personnel Committee of the Regents reported that it had reviewed the financial-interests statements of the Secretary’s top assistants and that it found no conflict of interest whatsoever.
The Treasurer informed the Regents that a self-assessment review has recently been conducted at the Institution to identify lower priority programs that might be reduced or eliminated, and alternative modes of operation that might create savings of dollars or workyears. After extensive discussion, the Regents agreed that in view of the existing security and financial constraints the Institution should eliminate summer evening hours on a trial basis, subject, if necessary, to further review by the Audit and Review Committee.
It was noted that final congressional action resulted in fiscal year 1982 federal appropriations totaling $142,534,000, some 9 percent below the amount requested. That appropriation included $960,000 for Quadrangle planning—the first federal appropriation for this project. The Treasurer also reported that the Office of Management and Budget (oms) allowance for all appropriations for fiscal year 1983 was $192,610,000, reflecting increases for Museum Support Center equipment, critical security and maintenance, and inflation in pay, utilities, and rent. In addition, oms allowed the Institution’s full request ($36.5 million) for Quadrangle construction, but did not allow the Institution’s request for an additional 99 positions to open and operate the Museum Support Center and 48 other positions to strengthen security.
The Investment Policy Committee reported that they met on November 17, 1981, to review the performance of the Institution’s three investment managers and to discuss strategies for the future. It was noted that the managers continue to out-perform market averages and that the annualized return from each of the managers for the last three and one-half years was about 16 percent per year.
The Secretary outlined the Five-Year Prospectus, FY 1983-1987 and stressed his commitment to include projections beyond the five-year period where appropriate. Priorities of the Institution were the equipment for the Museum Support Center, the completion of the Quadrangle, the enhancement of collections management activities, security, and automation. The Regents approved

noted prospects for additional foreign donations. It was noted that all gifts and pledges ($13,910,800), added to Smithsonian unrestricted fund transfer ($12,357,100), total $26,267,900—more than two-thirds of the $37.5 million goal.
The Secretary underscored the importance of the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates in the domestic fund-raising campaign, noting that the extraordinary generosity and dedication of several members has been critical to launching a sequential strategy for soliciting leadership-level gifts, to be followed by an expanded search for more moderate gifts. A series of special regional meetings will be arranged for the Secretary in this connection. A broader appeal to the entire membership of the National Associates may ensue.
One of America’s leading collectors of Near and Far Eastern art, Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, made a firm proposal for the donation of works of oriental art valued at $50 million and also $4 million in cash toward the construction costs of the Quadrangle, with the condition that the new gallery of Near and Far Eastern art will be named for him. After discussion, the Regents authorized the Secretary to negotiate terms of the agreement, subject to further review by the Board.
Mr. Ripley informed the Regents that the Museum Support Center was 65 percent complete on April 22, 1982, and that procedures are being developed to facilitate a complex, multi-stage move to the center. The Secretary reported on the status of the Institution-wide collections inventory and the progress in formulating up-to-date collections management policies.
It was noted that the Secretary received the rank of Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau just prior to the visit of the Queen of The Netherlands, in recognition of the work culminating in the Queen’s opening of the De Stijl exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, as well as, more generally, the Smithsonian’s work over the years. The Regents offered their approval and congratulations.
The traditional Regents’ Dinner was held in honor of Mr. Webb the evening of May 2, in the “Commons” of the Smithsonian Institution Building. The guests gathered in the Victorian Garden, where a model of the Quadrangle was on view. The Chancellor presented a citation to Mr. Webb dedicating the Webb Fellow-

ships in his honor: “. . . the Webb Fellowships will nurture management abilities of Smithsonian employees and visiting scholars for years to come—and will therefore continue to symbolize our profound gratitude for this sensitive and dear colleague.” The Secretary offered a toast to Dr. Fred L. Whipple, in whose name the astronomical observatory at Mt. Hopkins was to be dedicated on May 7, 1982. There followed a showing of the film In Open Air, procured through the generosity of the Allbritton Foundation in connection with the exhibition of the American Impressionists’ paintings.
The Chancellor called to order the autumn meeting of the Board of Regents on Monday, September 20, 1982, in the Regents’ Room. The Executive Committee reported on their August 25 meeting, where the Committee discussed contingency plans, should a pay supplemental appropriation not be forthcoming, and called for a staff report on the projected deficit of the Division of Performing Arts to be distributed to the Audit and Review Committee. The Treasurer reported that the Institution’s banking and cash-management systems are being simplified, streamlined, and modernized. The Committee then discussed in detail the status of the Quadrangle project and agreed to recommend proceedings as proposed (see below).
The Audit and Review Committee reported on its meeting of May 21, 1982, noting that Coopers and Lybrand had found no weaknesses in accounting and controls in their audit of fiscal year 1981 federal appropriations. Mr. Jameson presented a report on the status of equal opportunity and affirmative action, emphasizing the persisting problems of underrepresentation in professional and administrative positions. The Committee received a report on the organization of book publishing at the Smithsonian.
The Treasurer informed the Regents that the Institution received a federal supplemental appropriation of $2.7 million, some $400,000 above the Institution’s request of $2.3 million for fiscal year 1982; that Unrestricted General Trust Funds were projected to provide a small surplus of $47,000, compared to an original breakeven budget; and that substantial gains by the magazine, the National Associates, and the Smithsonian Institution Press largely offset higher administrative and program expenses and a substantial deficit in the Division of Performing Arts.

federal sources a sum which, when combined with the appropriated funds, is sufficient for the construction. Assuming approval of this appropriation (the House included it in the continuing resolution for fiscal year 1983), the Board of Regents needed to certify the availability of the nonfederal sources before any construction appriation could be obligated. Given the success of efforts to date, the strength of future prospects, and the existence of trust funds in the event insufficient funds are raised, the Regents voted to express gratitude to the Congress and the President for the authorization of the Quadrangle project and the anticipated implementing appropriation; to affirm full confidence in the ability of the Institution to secure from nonfederal sources remaining funds to total $37.5 million towards the Quadrangle project; to pledge that unrestricted trust funds of the Institution will be directed to the project to the extent necessary to guarantee its commitment of $37.5 million of nonfederal funds; and to certify therefore that, with an appropriation as requested, total project funds of $75 million are available, and construction may commence. Subsequent to the meeting, the Regents’ resolution was communicated to the chairmen of the Smithsonian’s authorizing and appropriations committees in the Congress.
The Secretary highlighted a report on the construction of the Museum Support Center, then more than 90 percent complete, ahead of schedule, and within budget. Favorable bids were received for supplying the storage equipment for “’wet” collections, while specifications continue to be developed for other kinds of storage equipment (to be bid in January 1983).
In recognition of Mr. Warren Robbins’s service to the Smithsonian and to the nation in founding the National Museum of African Art and overseeing its development from a small private venture to its present status, the Regents voted to award him the Henry Medal. The Regents also voted to appoint to the Commission of the National Museum of African Art, effective January 1, 1983, Frank Moss, Frances Humphrey Howard, Roy Sieber, David Driskell, and Robert Nooter for a term of three years; Walter Washington, Richard Long, John Loughran, Susan Samuels, and Robert Thompson for a term of two years; and Franklin Williams, Lee Bronson, John Duncan, Michael Sonnenreich, and Sylvia Boone for a term of one year.

Smithsonian Institution « 1982
Summary: In fiscal year 1982, the overall financial resources provided to the Smithsonian permitted maintenance of its extensive programs in exhibits and research, in public education and outreach. During this time of financial uncertainty, the continued strong support from Congress, from donors, from granting agencies, and from revenue-generating auxiliary activities made possible the progress and important accomplishments noted elsewhere in this report. The bar chart on the facing page summarizes the funds provided to the Smithsonian from a wide variety of sources, as well as the application of these moneys for an equally diverse range of programs. Evident from this chart is the growth of the operating budget in 1982 over prior years; as in the most recent years, however, this growth related less to program expansion than to the ever higher costs of salaries, supplies, utilities, and collection purchases. While some enhancements were possible, notably for the new Museum Support Center and for the collection inventory process, the year was characterized by fiscal restraint, self-assessment, and cost-reduction efforts. Due to partial hiring freezes and budget constraints, the full-time staff of the Smithsonian was kept to a level below that of last year.
While not unaffected by the government budget restrictions of this fiscal year, the Institution was nevertheless allowed a federal appropriation sufficient to sustain ongoing operations. After detailed and understanding review by the Congress, total federal appropriations of some $145 million were passed, including $131 million for operations; it is this appropriation which provides the Institution’s base resources for research, education, and exhibition

<<<Page: 28>>>

programs, for study and care of the national collections, and for administrative and support services. Of signal importance to the Institution was a planning appropriation of $1 million in support of the Quadrangle, the center more fully described by the Secretary in his Statement; this commitment of federal funds to a project whose costs will be met from matched federal and nonfederal funds was most welcome. (Subsequently, on October 2, 1982, the remaining funds of $36.5 million were voted and signed by the President for fiscal year 1983.) Also important to the Institution in fulfilling its public duties was the annual appropriation for the necessary, but less inspiring, task of repairing and maintaining the large and diverse physical plant. Significant funding was also received from federal agencies in the form of grants and contracts, primarily for scientific research.
In addition to the core support provided by the federal appropriations, the Institution is also dependent on nonappropriated trust funds to enrich its programs and expand their reach. Strong public acceptance of the Institution’s services continued during the year, with tangible financial return from the Smithsonian Associates programs and other auxiliary activities, as well as generous gifts and grants from individuals, foundations, and corporations. While net revenues from nonappropriated sources, after deduction of the operating expenses and sales costs of auxiliary activities, were lower than in fiscal year 1981, ongoing program commitments were met, and, as budgeted, transfers were made of $2 million to unrestricted endowment and $1 million toward Quadrangle construction reserve. Together with the transfers of prior years as well as favorable investment return, the unrestricted endowment of the Institution now totals some $37 million; continued addition to this fund remains a high priority of the Institution.
Significant progress was made during the year in securing financial support for the Quadrangle. As outlined more fully below, gifts and commitments to this project from outside sources as well as the Institution’s own resources now total almost three-quarters of the nonfederal funds of $37.5 million needed for construction. Fund-raising efforts for this major project are actively underway.

Operating Funds—Sources and Application
Growth in the overall operating budget of the Institution continued, but at a slightly slower pace than experienced in previous years. Total gross operating funds, as shown in Table 1, increased by over $17 million, or 7 percent, from $236,296,000 in fiscal year 1981 to $253,366,000 in fiscal year 1982. These funds were derived from three major sources: 52 percent from federal appropriations, 43 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 5 percent from federal agency grants and contracts.
After deducting expenses of the nonappropriated auxiliary and bureau activities, net operating income grew by only $4.4 million, approximately 3 percent, and was derived 80 percent from federal appropriations, 12 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 8 percent from federal agency grants and contracts. Application of these funds by all Smithsonian bureaux is outlined in Table 2, with further supporting detail in succeeding tables.
The federal appropriation for the core operating programs of the Institution totaled $131,170,000 in fiscal year 1982. The increase of $8.7 million, or 7 percent, over fiscal year 1981 was approximately equivalent to increased costs resulting from inflation in such areas as pay, utilities, rent, and other objects of expense. The appropriation included specific increases for these inflationary costs as well as for such high-priority programs as the inventory of collections and equipping of the Museum Support Center. These were, however, partially offset by an across-the-board reduction to all Smithsonian programs, part of a government-wide cutback aimed at reducing the nation’s overall budget deficit. In order to prevent major disruption to ongoing programs and public activities, a series of financial actions were taken. Additional control on hiring, travel, and all nonessential purchases and contracts was instituted. Based on a comprehensive management review of all Smithsonian programs, certain activities were curtailed or deferred, including elimination of spring and summer evening visiting hours in all museums except the National Air and Space Museum and the National Zoological Park. Following regulations set forth by congressional committees, funds were reprogrammed among bureaux to

for specified purposes, restricted funds provided substantial support for a wide variety of research, exhibitions, publications, and educational activities, and served as the major funding source for the Freer Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port (formerly the Fort Pierce Bureau). A particularly significant contribution was received by the Office of Museum Programs in fiscal year 1982 in the form of a three-year grant of $1.1 million from the Kellogg Foundation. This grant will be used to fund a series of fellowships, colloquia, workshops, and videotapes designed to strengthen the education role of America’s museums. Revenues to Unrestricted Special Purpose funds during the year totaled $4.7 million. Bureau activities, such as the National Air and Space Museum Theater and the membership programs of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, generated revenues of $2,925,000, while gifts, interest earned on the investment of bureau fund balances, zoo parking revenues, and other miscellaneous income accounted for an additional $1,786,000. Also included in this fund category are allocations for the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach programs, for preand postdoctoral fellowship awards, and for revenue-sharing to bureaux housing cen-

trally managed shop and concession activities. As specified by the Bylaws of the Regents, transfers were made to endowment of otherwise unrestricted bequests received during the year.
Unrestricted General Purpose fund revenue is derived primarily from investment income and net revenues of the auxiliary activities. After deduction of auxiliary activity expenses, net general unrestricted funds provided some $11 million for general Institutional purposes, a decrease of approximately $3.5 million, or 24 percent, from the previous year (see Table 6).
Several factors have contributed to this reduction in income, including lower postal subsidies to nonprofit organizations, lower museum visitation, limiting of summer evening hours to the National Zoological Park and the National Air and Space Museum, and higher expenses, particularly as related to the recording program of the Division of Performing Arts. Unanticipated costs of promotion and record production combined with an unfortunately high rate of bad debts and inventory adjustments resulted in a net loss to this activity of more than $2.5 million. Of net revenues generated by the auxiliary activities, some $8.1 million was from the Associates programs. The Smithsonian magazine was responsible for the majority of this income, continuing its success of previous years. Sizable surpluses totaling over $1.5 million were also generated by the Museum Shops, the Mail Order Division, and the Smithsonian Institution Press, which in fiscal year 1982 was reorganized to include the publishing activities of the Smithsonian Exposition Books. Income generated by concessions, parking, and food services provided an additional $1.5 million, which was somewhat below last year’s results, due primarily to lower visitation and the costs of converting two concessionaire-managed food facilities (at the National Air and Space Museum and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden) to Smithsonian-run operations.
Notwithstanding the decline in unrestricted general purpose revenues, continued support was provided a wide range of administrative and programmatic activities, including major operating support for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Office of Telecommunications, Office of Folklife Programs, and the Visitor Information and Reception Center. Special allotments were also made for fundraising efforts related to the Quadrangle construction, for the cooperative education and other programs initiated in fiscal year 1981

Special Foreign Currency Program
Foreign currencies accumulated from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 83-480, determined by the Treasury Department to be in excess of the normal needs of the United States, are made available to the Smithsonian through the Special Foreign Currency Program. An appropriation of excess foreign currencies equivalent to $4,320,000 was received under this program in fiscal year 1982. Some $3.4 million was used to continue a program of grants to United States institutions for field research and advanced professional training in the countries of Burma, India, and Pakistan. Fields of study focused on areas of traditional Smithsonian competence, including archaeology and related disciplines, systematic and environmental biology, astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum programs. The balance of funds appropriated—$960,000—was provided for the international effort to preserve the monumental site of Moenjodaro in Pakistan. This appropriation represented the first increment of a total of $4 million equivalent in nonconvertible Pakistani currency expected to be

The market value of Smithsonian Endowment Funds was $90,231,000 on September 30, 1982, as compared to $79,025,000 on September 30, 1981. The majority of these funds—$88,858,000 —is invested in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment fund under outside investment management; $1 million is on permanent deposit with the United States Treasury; and the remaining $373,000 is held in miscellaneous securities and donated real estate. Approximately 59 percent of the endowments, as shown in Table 10, are

restricted, with income available only for purposes specified by the donor. The remaining 41 percent—or $37,160,000—are unrestricted, with income available for general Institutional purposes; certain of these unrestricted funds, however, such as the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History, have been designated internally for specific purposes, as noted in Table 13, which lists all Smithsonian endowments.
Investment management of the Pooled Consolidated Endowment fund is conducted by three professional advisory firms under the oversight of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer, and subject to guidelines established by the Board of Regents. As of the end of fiscal year 1982, the firms (with their respective portions of the fund) were Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (50 percent), Batterymarch Financial Management Corp. (31 percent), and Torray Clark & Company (19 percent). The total rate of return for the fund during fiscal year 1982, as calculated by an outside investment measurement service, was +15.7 percent (including interest and dividend income as well as market value appreciation), as compared to +12.1 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and +9.9 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 average (both calculated on the same basis). Table 11 displays the market values of the major components of the fund for prior years, and the activity during the past year is shown on Table 12.
The Smithsonian utilizes the Total Return Income policy, which defines total investment return as yield (interest and dividends) plus appreciation, including both realized and unrealized capital gains. A portion of this return is made available for expenditure each

year, and the remainder is retained as principal. This total return income payout is determined in advance each year by the Board of Regents based on studies of anticipated interest and dividend yields, the Institution’s programmatic needs, inflationary factors, and the five-year running average of market values, adjusted for capital additions or withdrawals. The income payout rate for fiscal year 1982 to restricted purpose endowments in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment fund constituted an 8 percent increase over the prior year, while the payout to unrestricted endowments was reduced from the earlier level, permitting a proportionately greater reinvestment for unrestricted endowments. After the income payout of $3,275,000 during the year, a total of $2,064,000 of excess interest and dividend yield was reinvested into endowment principal.
A full listing of all endowment funds is shown on Table 13. Detail of the securities held in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment fund as of September 30, 1982, may be obtained upon request from the Treasurer of the Institution.

Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of Presentation. These financial statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (Institution) but are administered under separate boards of trustees. (See Note 2.)
The accounts of the federal funds have been prepared on the obligation basis of accounting, which basis is in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth in the Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The obligation basis of accounting differs in some respects from generally accepted accounting principles. Under this basis of accounting, commitments, such as purchase orders and contracts, are recognized as expenditures, and the related obligations are reported on the balance sheet even though goods and services have not been received. Such commitments aggregate $30,929,000 at September 30, 1982.
The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, from federal grants and contracts and from certain business activities related to the operations of the Institution. The federal funds reflect the receipt and expenditures of funds obtained from Congressional appropriations.
Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for funds control, accounting and reporting purposes into funds established according to their appropriation, nature and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
The assets, liabilities and fund balances of the Institution are reported in self-balancing fund groups as follows:
Trust current funds, which include unrestricted resources, represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific purposes are segregated from other current funds.

<<<Page: 51>>>

Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment and similar funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds. Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisitions and funds expended for plant.
Federal operating funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—Salaries and Expenses appropriations, Special Foreign Currency appropriations, and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund.
The balance of this fund represents amounts available for support of specific Institution operations including the Special Foreign Currency Program, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Appropriations, and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund.
Federal construction funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for building and facility construction, restoration, renovation and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—Construction and Improvements, National Zoological Park, Restoration and Renovation of Buildings and Museum Support Center.
Federal capital funds represent the amount of the investment of the United States Government in the net assets of the Institution acquired with federal funds and nonexpendable property transfers from Government agencies.
Investments. All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other disposition of investments are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar manner, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds.
Merchandise inventory. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or retail cost method (for those inventories held for resale).
Materials and supplies inventory. Inventories of materials and supplies are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription,

<<<Page: 52>>>

which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine are charged against income over the period of the subscription.
The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.
Works of art, living or other specimens. The Institution acquires its collections, which include works of art, library books, photographic archives, objects and specimens, through purchase or by donation of the items themselves. In accordance with policies generally followed by museums, no value is assigned to the collections on the statement of financial condition. Purchases for the collections are expensed currently.
Property and equipment. Capital improvements and equipment purchased with trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to ten years. All other capital improvements and equipment purchased with trust funds are expensed currently.
Real estate (land and buildings) purchased with trust funds is recorded at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings purchased with trust funds is not recorded.
Buildings and other structures, additions to buildings and fixed equipment purchased with federal funds are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 30 years.
Certain lands occupied by the Smithsonian Institution’s buildings were appropriated and reserved by the Congress for that purpose and are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. Property and nonexpendable equipment acquired through transfer from Government agencies are capitalized at the transfer price or at estimated amounts taking into consideration their usefulness, condition and market value. Nonexpendable equipment purchased with federal funds is recorded at cost depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Government contracts. The Institution has a number of contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract revenue is recognized when billable or received in the trust funds.
Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these statements since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.
Annual leave unfunded. The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual leave in accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the cost of leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense. The cost of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal funds.

<<<Page: 53>>>

2. Related activities
The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several separately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution facilities occupied, etc. totaled approximately $323,000 for the year ended September 30, 1982. The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1982 as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

Substantially all the investments of the endowment and similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $148.04, 290,802 units were owned by endowment, and 309,427 units were owned by quasi-endowment at September 30, 1982.
The following tabulation summarizes changes in relationships between cost and market values of the pooled investments:

<<<Page: 55>>>

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from the current funds.
In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such factors as, but not limited to: (1) 41/2°/o of the five-year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2) current dividends and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110°/o of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received. The total return factor for 1982 was $5.94 per unit to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $5.00 per unit to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds; new units were purchased for the Unrestricted Endowment Funds with the $.94, the difference in the total return factor. The total return applied for 1982 was $2,230,000 to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $1,046,000 to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds.
Endowment reimbursement represents payment of income, which had accumulated in principal of the endowment funds, in accordance with a settlement related to a lawsuit.
7. Receivables
Receivables at September 30, 1982 included the following:

8. Advance payments
Advance payments represent advances made to Government agencies, educational institutions, firms and individuals for services to be rendered or property or materials to be furnished.

<<<Page: 56>>>

As of September 30, 1982, the Institution has advances outstanding to the U.S. Government of approximately $4,084,000, principally for construction services to be received in the future. The Institution at that date also had advances outstanding to educational institutions amounting to approximately $2,150,000, principally under the Special Foreign Currency Program.
9. Property and equipment
At September 30, 1982, property and equipment which has been capitalized (see Note 1) is comprised of the following:

Depreciation and amortization expense reflected in expenditures of the current funds for 1982 was $495,000. Depreciation expense reflected in expenditures of the capital funds of 1982 was $9,619,000.
The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1982 includes $8,568,000 of unexpended plant funds.
10. Pension plan
The Institution has separate retirement plans for trust and federal employees. Under the trust fund’s plan, both the Institution and employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1982 was $2,771,000. It is the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently. There are no unfunded prior service costs under the plan.
The federal employees of the Institution are covered by the Civil Service Retirement Program. Under this program, the Institution withholds from the gross pay of each federal employee and remits to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) the amounts specified by such program.

<<<Page: 57>>>

The Institution contributes 7°/o of basic annual salary to the Fund. The cost
of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1982 was approximately $5,200,000.
11. Excess of expenditures and other deductions
The net excess of expenditures and other deductions over revenue and other additions disclosed for federal operating and construction funds in the Statement of Activity for the year ended September 30, 1982 arise because certain multiyear appropriations, having been recorded as income in prior years and carried forward as fund balance, were expended during the year.
12. Nonmandatory transfers for designated purposes
The following transfers among trust funds were made for the year ended September 30, 1982 in thousands of dollars:

(281) 241 — 40 a $(4,465) $(1,216) $4,866 $ 815
13. Income taxes
The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that section are taxable only on their unrelated business income. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a Technical Advice Memorandum to the Institution indicating that income derived from sales of certain items in the Museum Shops may constitute unrelated business taxable income. The application of this memorandum is under discussion with the Internal Revenue Service.
It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such dual status but intends to do so in the near future.
Management believes that any income taxes required as a result of settlement of these matters would not have a material effect upon the financial position of the Institution.
