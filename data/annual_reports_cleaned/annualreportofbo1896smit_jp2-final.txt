ee OAR UPON
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U. S. National Museum.
By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became the only lawful place of deposit for ‘all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States.” These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum of the United States. For many years this Museum was supported entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, and a considerable portion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or purchase.
A “museum” has been defined by Professor Huxley as “a consultative library of objects.” Not only is the National Museum such a consultative library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people of the whole country. It keeps in mind the needs of those whose lives are not occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and the skilled investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve to hundreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the United States who enter its halls every year, and through the distribution of the duplicate specimeus in the Museum, made up into sets and accurately named, to public institutions in all parts of the country.
The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been detailed in previous reports, and was made the special subject of a paper entitled “The Genesis of the National Museum.”! [or our pres-
‘The Genesis of the National Museum,” Report of the Smithsonian Institution (U.S. National Museum), 1891, pp. 273-330.

<<<Page: 35>>>

ent purpose it will suftice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as there stated. :
The formation of a national museum in the city of Washington was first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called “The National Institution,” and afterwards “The National Institute,” which was for four years exceedingly prosperous and active. The nucleus for a national museum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive, and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence. In the meantime the Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858, when the so called ‘National Cabinet of Curiosities” passed into the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term ‘“‘National Museum” was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to designate the collections in the Smithsonian building.
In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution:
Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.!
After the ‘‘national cabinet” had been delivered to the Regents, annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance. During the twenty-three years which followed, the collections were greatly increased and were made the basis of numerous important memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The pubhe halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of the collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain amount of instruction and pleasure was afforded to visitors. The appropriations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staff was so inadequate that little could be done except to keep the colleetions in good preservation.
The broad plan upon which the operations of the National Museum are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor Henry wrote:
There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.?
‘Report of committee on organization, p. 20. * Report of the Smithsonian Institution, 1853, p. 245,

<<<Page: 36>>>

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much emphasis of the difficulties attending the assumption by the Institution of the care of the national collections, and in the Report of the Institution for 1870' he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims proper to such a museum.
‘There is scarcely any subject connected with science and education to which more attention is given at the present day than that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the general denominations of museums. This arises from their growing importance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.”
In the Report for 1873? allusion was made to. the increase in the national collections, even then very great, “requiring the utmost exertions of the limited force connected with the National Museum for its proper treatment.”
Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been more liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as ever is needed in the development of its plans for the future.
The Smithsonian Institution, from its foundation, fostered explorations, and its museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many gifts were received from private sources, and valuable objects were deposited in its museum for safe-keeping. The nucleus of its collections was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.
At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized by the Government, and during their progress large collections of ethnological and natural history objects were made. Important foreign material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition, Perry’s Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Survey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps brought together great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of North America.
A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission, The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific work.
At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the United States Government and those of numerous foreign governments and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum.

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of the Smithsonian building were already overflowing with the accumulations of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requisite work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new and broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of the country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient methods of museum administration. The exhibition of 1876 had been indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of the United States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it taught as to the possibilities for good in public museums.
The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were given to the United States for its National Musem were of large intrinsic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion of the Museum itself.
In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all necessary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganization was made in 1881, under the immediate care of the present assistant secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge of a curator.
There are now twenty-eight organized departments and sections in the Museum, the larger number of which are in charge of specialists who receive no salary from the Museum. There are also seven administrative offices.
The history of the National Museum may be divided into three periods:
First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific description and theory.
Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the “National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve an educational purpose.
Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the

<<<Page: 38>>>

Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.
During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum endeavors to promote them all.
It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those materials that hatve served as a foundation for the reports upon the resources of the United States.
It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.
It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named series of duplicates.
In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accomplished since the time of reorganization in 1881.
The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows:
(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected, efficient for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occasion may require, and many capable museum experts have been trained for work in other institutions.
(2) Through the agency of the staff the materials in the Museum, the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classified, and brought under control and arranged in such manner as to insure their sefety and make them available for study.
(3) The collections have been increased eighteenfold.
(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development of a well-labeled and effectually installed exhibition series, available for the instruction of the public.
(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classification in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and which will be made available for other institutions from time to time through the publications of the Museum.

<<<Page: 39>>>

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by expertment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed eisewhere have been adopted. Our new methods are being applied in many similar establishments at home and abroad.
(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models has been advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of the experts in the employ of the Museum.
(8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of | specialists in the production of these papers has greatly enhanced the value of the national collections.
(9) Popular educational work of unquestioned value has been accomplished by participation in the great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin, London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.
(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distributed to other museums and to colleges and schools.
That the United States mnst have a National Museum worthy of the dignity of the nation is self-evident.
Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital city—centers of scientific and educational ‘activity—the treasure-house of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields of science, art, and industrial progress.!
These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character of its museums and libraries, intelligent persons, visiting a country, very properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civilization of the people.
Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable nor desirable to gather together’in this city extensive collections of ancient medieval art, but a representative series of such objects will undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public taste, promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza. tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished, attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geology and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour. agement of the arts and industries of our own people.
It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remembered that the national collections of every principal European nation are divided into several groups, each under Separate administration,
i . * > ' Most of the older nations have museums devoted to their military achievements and triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this field of work

<<<Page: 40>>>

though often within the general control of some central authority. In France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Department of Science and Art.
In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work which should properly be done by such museums 1s omitted, because no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand, much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortanate—collections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any department is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied and compared side by side. In Washington the national collections are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings. The Army Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this proximity, in connection with the long-established policy of cooperation between the two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes, united in interest.
Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the maintenance of the National Museum are small compared with those in several European countries, the value of objects given by private individuals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contributions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000 a year, and in some years it has been greater.
Among important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin Indian gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and ethnologist; the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley; the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000 conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the Rey. L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large and valuable collections of African mammals, birds, ete., made and presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr. William Astor Chanler; the Bendire and Ralph collections of American birds’ eggs, given to the Smithsonian Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of which from Philadelphia to Washington a special appropriation was made by Congress.
Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not yet come into its possession. Itis estimated that within the past fifteen years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to the Museum to the value of $100 each, or more.

<<<Page: 41>>>

The National Museum now contains more than three and a half millions of objects.
The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be expressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and priceless. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their completeness and to the labor which has been expended on them, can not be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their value would amount to several millions of dollars.
One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1896 the number of specimens is more than eighteen times as great as in 1882.
In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent, less perhaps in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire Museum is the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions, andof gifts prompted largely by the generosity of the American people.
As might be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contributions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of the collections for study by specialists and for general educational purposes.
The need of a larger fund for the purchase of specimens is yearly becoming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly offered at prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken by the museums and institutions of Europe.
The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book from which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narrative is disjointed and incomplete.
The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centuries. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has enormous deficiencies in every department. It needs, more than any museum in Europe, the opportunity to increase its resources through purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens for the National Museum since 1891 has averaged less than $7,000 a year.
For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum, from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of nearly $47,000.
; Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact stalusties are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in London is not less than $500,000 a year.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. len
Our Museum is the result of the activities of an enlightened Government. Through a thousand channels materials for the formation of a museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such materials our Museum has been built. A museum formed in this man ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome, and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies can only be supplied by purchase.
More striking present results might certainly have been attained by limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have, however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed, even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote.
The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of the Institution.
The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the “keeper of the Smithsonian Museum,” and the assistant secretary, by the usage of nearly fifty years, its executive head.
In the act of Congress passed in 1846, to establish the Smithsonian Institution, are contained the following provisions concerning the scope of the museum to be placed under its charge:
1. The act above referred to provides that ‘all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and, together with new specimens obtained by exchange, donation, or ‘otherwise, shall be so arranged and classified as best to facilitate examination and study.
2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them.
3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so classified as best to facilitate their examination and study.
4, It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to be erected for the Institution.
5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange of duplicate specimens and by gift, and directs also that they shall be appropriately classified and arranged.
The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit for all objects of art, archeology, ethnology, natural history, miner

<<<Page: 43>>>

alogy, geology, etc., belonging to the United States or eolloatan by any agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no longer needed for investigations in progress.
The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison.
The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three directions:
1, The permanent preservation of the collections already in its possession, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators and the skill of the preparators. :
2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired—
(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in accordance with law; otek.
(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from foreign governments; > Mee
(3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or for publications;
(4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special service of this nature;
(5) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for that purpose.
3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled by the best authorities.
The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large extent of the following materials:
1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumulated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smithsonian Institution.
2. Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian [nstitution in connection with educational institutions or commercial establishments.
3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of the Department of State and the cooperation of United States ministers and consuls,
4. The collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.
5. Collections made by the scientific officers of Government surveys, Such as the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Bound. ary Survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the United States Army and by officers of the Signal Corps of the United States Army stationed in remote regions.
6. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey the United States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the activities of the United States Department of Agriculture and other Departments of the Government.

<<<Page: 44>>>

7. The remnant of the collections of the old ‘“‘ National Institute.”
8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition in 1887, and the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893,
9, The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876.
10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the Philadelphia Exhibition and subsequently.
11. The materials received from museums in Kurope and America in exchange for duplicate specimens.
12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.
The publications of the Museum consist of—
1. The Annual Report.
2. The Proceedings of the National Museum.
3. The Bulletin of the National Museum.
4, The series of circulars.
Papers by members of the Museum staff, based upon the collections, have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States and in many of those of Europe.
The Smithsonian Institution, although it bears the name of a foreigner, has for half a century been one of the most important agencies in the intellectual life of our people. It has been a rallying point for the workers in every department of scientific and educational work and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other countries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes, are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientific investigator. Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of the national collection at the Capitol, and its museum is the richest in existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science to whom our country has given birth have passed their entire lifetime in working for its success.
Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by its system of international exchange, by means of which within the past forty-four years about one and a half million packages of books

<<<Page: 45>>>

and other scientiiic and literary materials have been distributed to every region of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as farreaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world.
It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other countries of American art and literature, or of American institutions generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound, vigorous, and progressive.
In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European countries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publications of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the United States as an example of what governments should do for the support of their scientific institutions.
It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, or more in accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address, admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science:
Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge.
In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.
No one has yet explained, except by conjecture, why James Smithson selected the United States as the seat of his foundation. He had no acquaintances in America, nor does he appear to have had any books relating to America, except two. Rhees quotes from one of these (“Travels through North America,” by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Society) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000 inhabitants, in which it is predicted that “the Federal city, as soon as navigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly,” and that, at a future day, if the affairs of the United States go on as prosperously as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the West and rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World.
Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realizing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organizations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of incaleulable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the United States would have been to-day without this bequest?
Well did President John Quincy Adams say:
Of all the foundations of establishments Jor pious or charitable uses

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Td
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of mankind.
The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year since 1846— intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant cooperation with the Government, public institutions, and individuals in every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed advice, support, or aid from manifold resources.
There have been, however, material results of its activities, the extent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them. The most important of these are the library and the Museum, which have grown up under its fostering care.
The library has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive system of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all parts of the world.
The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened, must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest of Smithson.’ Many of these publications are now out of print.
In return for these, and by purchase, it has received the great collection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest in the world in the publications of learned societies, and therefore of inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of every branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol, as a portion of the Congressional Library.
The Smithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred thousand volumes and parts of volumes, constituting perhaps onefourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its own upon the main floor of the new library building. The rapidity with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that more than 32,000 titles were added during the past fiscal year.”
The Institution has probably done more toward building up a great library in Washington than would have been possible had all its income been devoted strictly to library work, as was at one time seriously proposed.
‘This estimate is based upon the prices which are charged for the books by secondhand dealers, as shown in their catalogues.
*The working libraries of the National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology are distinct from the general Smithsonian library and areseparately administered. All of these are placed at the service of advanced students and specialists.

<<<Page: 47>>>

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though their number has been so largely increased year by year, now forming one of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which, it is hoped, will soon be remedied. a:
The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a considerable extent in behalf of the National Museum.
The amount expended during the past forty years from the private fund of the Institution, in the publication of books for gratuitous distribution, has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest.
These publications have had their influence for good in many ways; but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of the nation.
In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the Smithsonian Institution. The value of the collections thus acquired is estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson bequest.
The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library. It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876 that it was officially recognized as the National Museum of the United States.
But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution, the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus for a national museum.
The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smithsonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this report.
The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scientific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. In addition to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of information on scientific topics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered promptly and fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are sent Which will enavle them to find out such names for themselves in future. This work has not only an educational value, but often a great economic Importance as well, as, for instance, When some common min

<<<Page: 48>>>

eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some harmless animal feared as noxious.
The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every State and alinost every county in the United States. A careful study of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those distributed gratuitously by the Government.
Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been given to the Government than has been received. The machinery of the Institution’s action has been such that it has incidentally, in connection with its legitimate work for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, paid over to the Government the equivalent of much more than the whole original fund.
Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, property acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in value to the whole amount of the Smithson bequest?
Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources. The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con. gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.
Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution, it should be said that it is in the highest degree advantageous. It should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum, since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years it has deposited all the valuable gitts and bequests of specimens it has received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of paramount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers of the Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous correspondents.
The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not

<<<Page: 49>>>

only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render the resources of science available to the public at large.
The National Museum is a treasure-house filled with materials for the use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the people of the whole country. :
In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows:
(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few, but for the enlightenment and education of the masses.
(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to maintain.
(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an attractive as well as an intelligible form.
No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution, and no department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than the National Museum.
The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local institutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the distribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way, and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself, contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum in the world.
Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and similar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to national museums in other countries.
Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a very considerable extent directly and personally.
The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every citizen.
It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the

<<<Page: 50>>>

benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find no welzome among us.
The experience of Europe, with its magnificent public museums, and the history of the several expositions in the United States should be quite sufficient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the museum is an educational power even more influential than the public library.
The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years, not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of Great Britain, remarked to the writer:
We educate our working people in the public schools, give them a love for refined and beautiful objects, and stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave school, go into the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the gratification of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire. It is as much the duty of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their higher education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction.
In the same conversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and examinations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council of Education, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the chief agencies.!
1No new general statement relating to the history, organization, and activities of the National Museum having been prepared by Dr. Goode prior to his death, the foregoing paragraphs are repeated from the Report of 1895, with a few minor changes, bringing the subject down to date.—EDITOR.

<<<Page: 51>>>

There has been no change during the year in the number of scientific departments and sections in the Museum or in the number of administrative divisions.
Prof. C. V. Riley, honorary curator of the department of insects in the National Museum, and for many years entomologist of the Department of Agriculture, died on September 14, 1895. Mr. L. O. Howard, who was recently appointed entomologist of the Department of Agriculture, has also accepted the position held by Professor Riley in the Museum.
Mr. D. W. Coquillett has been appointed custodian of the collection of Diptera, Mr. W. H. Ashmead of the Hymenoptera, Mr. O. F. Cook of the Myriapoda, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz of the Coleopterous larve.
All of the appointments above mentioned were made under date of October 8, 1895.
Mr. George C. Maynard, of this city, was appointed custodian of the electrical collections in March, 1896, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department of Agriculture, has been made an Associate in Zoology.
Mr. R, E. Earll, editor of Proceedings and Bulletins, died on March 19, 1896. Dr. Marcus Benjamin was appointed on April 1 to fill the vacancy thus made.
A complete list of the officers of the Museum will be found in Appendix I.
There have been 1,299 accessions during the year, an increase of 76 over the record for preceding fiscal year, and of 138 over the record for the year ending June 30, 1894. These accessions embrace 73,104 specimens, and were included between accession numbers 29535 and 30833. The appended tables show, respectively, the number of Specimens received by the various departments of the Museum during the year, and the total number of specimens in those departments on June 30, 1896. It will be seen that the number of specimens now in the Museum is estimated at more than 3,500,000.

The increase in the collections during the year, resulting directly or indirectly from assistance rendered by the Executive Departments and Bureaus of the Government, or by officials whose duties have enabled them to collect for the Museum or to influence and encourage others in so doing, has been very satisfactory.
The active support which the Museum has always enjoyed at the hands of American ministers and consuls stationed abroad has been most gratifying. During the year covered by this report a series of photographs and etchings were transmitted by Mr. R. M. Bartleman, United States consul, Antigua, West Indies. Mr. Alfred Krauss, United States consular agent, Zittau, Germany, has forwarded geological material. Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State, whose generous gifts have been so often alluded to in the reports, has continued to aid the Museum. Mr. Henry C. Smith, United States consul, Santos, Brazil, transmitted a sloth, in behalf of Mr. Gustave G, Beyer.

<<<Page: 61>>>

The prompt compliance of the Treasury Department with requests for the free entry of material from abroad, and the continued courtesies extended by the collector of customs in connection with its transportation to Washington, have resulted in saving much time and money to the Museum, and the assistance thus rendered is very highly appreciated.
The Museum is indebted to Capt. J. H. Long, keeper of the lifesaving station at Fenwicks Island, Delaware, for the skeleton of a Finback Whale.
Lieut. J. H. Scott, of the United States revenue-marine cutter Forward, has transmitted a specimen of Hawk Moth, Hnyo lugubris.

Several officers of the United States Army have interested themselves in obtaining material for the Museum from various parts of the United States, South America, and the West Indies. Prominent among them are Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Maj. Charles Bendire, Capt. W.C. Brown, Capt. Henry Romeyn, Lieut. Wirt Robinson, Dr. E. R. Hodge, Dr. W. M. Brewer, Dr. D. S. Lamb, Dr. Washington Matthews, and Dr. J. C. Merrill. Mr. Isaac C. Noyes, of the Army Medical Museum, transmitted an archeological object from Virginia.
The Museum is indebted to officers of the Navy for several interesting contributions to the Museum collections. Through the aid of Lieut. Commander 8S. M. Schley valuable additions to the collections have been obtained. Dr. James M. Flint continues to act as honorary curator of the section of materia medica in the Museum.
Under the Department of the Interior, the United States Geological Survey has transmitted a large number of collections made by members of its staff while engaged in field duty. Among these should be especially mentioned Prof. F. W. Clarke, Dr. David T. Day, Dr. T. M. . Chatard, Dr. W. H. Dall, and Mr. T. W. Stanton. Hon. Charles D.. Walcott, Director of the Survey, has transmitted specimens illustrating the Lower Cambrian formation from the White Mountain Range, Inyo County, Cal., and Carboniferous limestone fossils from Berne, Albany County, N. Y. The collections received from the Survey are enumerated in the List of Accessions (Appendix It).

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. al
From the Bureau of Education was received a photograph of twin Eskimo children at Port Clarence, Alaska.
Perhaps no bureau of the Government has been in closer affiliation with the National Museum in past years than the United States Fish Commission. Since its organization in 1871 the Museum has been constantly enriched by the acquisition of large collections, especially of fishes and marine invertebrate objects. These departments in the Museum have hitherto been cared for by officers of the Fish Commission, and their honorary position as curators in the Museum, it is thought, has been a source of much mutual benefit to the Commission and the Museum. The collections of special interest from the Commission during the present year were gathered principally by, or through the cooperation of, Prof. B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, and Mr. Charles H. Townsend.
The collections received during the year from the different bureaus of the Department of Agriculture have been large and varied. The botanical collections, under the care of Mr. F. V. Coville, Botanist of that Department, have been greatly enriched. Large quantities of interesting botanical material have been obtained from different sections of the country, through the agency of collectors connected with the Department of Agriculture. In the classification of plants, ete., as well as in obtaining material, Prof. F. L. Lamson-Scribner, Dr. J. N. Rose, and Mr. J. B. Leiberg have been conspicuous in their efforts.
The services of Mr. L. O. Howard, entomologist of the Department, who succeeded Prof. C. V. Riley as honorary curator of the department of insects in the National Museum, have resulted in the addition of numerous specimens to the Museum collection. In the classification and identification of the collections of Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Diptera he has been ably assisted by Messrs. Ashmead, Linell, and Coquillett. The Museum is also indebted to Mr. E. A. Schwarz for large collections of different orders of insects collected by him.
Through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Biological Survey, types and other specimens of fishes collected by the Death Valley Expedition and described by Prof. C. H. Gilbert, have been transferred to the Museum. Fishes, crabs and shrimps, land and fresh-water shells, collected by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman in Mexico and in the western part of the United States, have been received, as well as large quantities of other material obtained by collectors attached to the Department of Agriculture.
The Bureau of Animal Industry, under the direction of Dr. D. E. Salmon, has been instrumental in adding to the Museum some very interesting material. Among the most valuable collections of parasites transmitted by the Bureau are those made by Dr. C. W. Stiles, the honorary custodian of the helminthological collections of the National Museum.
The collections which have been received from the Bureau of Eth

<<<Page: 63>>>

nology have been not only large in numbers, but of great importance. Particular mention is here made of the material obtained by Dervis Walter Fewkes in connection with his exploratious in Arizona and New Mexico, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.
Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his explorations in Africa and India, and the collections which he has forwarded | to the Museum during the year have been of unusual interest and importance. The value of the ethnological objects included in his collections has been very greatly enhanced by the fulland accurate descriptions accompanying them. A series of skins of lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar to Madagascar is of special interest. The material is carefully prepared and unusually well preserved.
An interesting collection of antiquities was obtained by Dr. J.Walter Fewkes during the summer of 1895 from the cliff dwellings and ancient pueblos near Tusayan, Ariz.
During the travels of Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, in the West Indies and South America, he obtained some desirable natural-history material for the Museum.
For several years Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, has been an enthusiastic co-operator in the work of the National Museum. In connection with the Boundary Commission between the United States and Mexico he made very extensive and valuable collections for the Museum, and has later been instrumental in various ways in adding natural-history material to its collections. During 1896 he collected for the Museum mammals, birds, and other natural-history specimens in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and along the Gulf of California.
A large collection of human bones was obtained by Gen. A. L. Pridemore, Jonesville, Va., while engaged in mound explorations in Scott County. This collection has been generously presented by him to the National Museum.
Dr. Rh. Ellsworth Call, Cincinnati, Ohio, has explored the Mammoth Cave and other caves in Kentucky. In the former he obtained several interesting specimens of bats, which he has presented to the Museum.
Outfits to be used in collecting specimens for the National Museum have been furnished to the following persons during the year: Dr. Edgar A, Mearns, United States Army, Gettysburg, Pa.; Mr. C. W. Richmond, United States National Museum, for collecting in Virginia; Prof. C. H. Gilbert, care of United States consul, Panama, Colombia, South America; Rev. P. UL. Sérensen, Jakobshavn, North Greenland; Prof. K. Ellsworth Call, 317 Walnut street, Cincinnati, Ohio; Mr. Robert Ridgway, United States National Museum, for collecting in

Florida; Mr. E. W. Vickers, Ellsworth, Ohio; Dr. Frank Furlong, care of the steamship Galilee, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Mr. Frank Burns, Suffolk, Va.; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, for collecting in Arizona, and Mr. A, W. Anthony, San Diego, Cal.
In the department of mammals the exhibition series is practically unchanged. A few specimens were withdrawn for a time for exhibition at Atlanta. The type of Chanler’s Reed Buck was put on a new stand and added to the exhibition series, and a young lion and young tiger were also placed upon exhibition.
In the department of mollusks the exhibition series is in good condition, and has been beautified by the addition of a series of mounted specimens illustrating the chief families of mollusks exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. A portion of the exhibition series in the department of insects is now displayed in the small room adjoining the hall occupied by the department of comparative anatomy. The work of renovating the mounted collection in the department of birds, which was begun during the last fiscal year, has been continued. The exhibition series of birds’ eggs and nests is in good condition, and it would be very desirable to increase it, were this course now practicable. é
The synoptic series of invertebrates has been transferred from the department of marine invertebrates to the department of comparative anatomy, and the space which it formerly occupied will be devoted to an exhibit of deep-sea fishes. Some slight changes have been made in the cases in the west hail of the Smithsonian building, and a number of deep-sea sponges and corals, together with some holothurians in alcohol and a few starfishes, have been placed upon exhibition. Labels have been printed for the holothurians, and labels for the starfishes are in preparation. All of the named sponges on exhibition have also been provided with printed labels. The table cases in this department have been provided with casters, so that they may be readily moved without danger of injuring the specimens. In the department of fishes there are five cases of plaster casts on exhibition, one case containing stuffed fishes, a large number of casts on the tops of cases, and a small group of land Gobies.
The mounting of the exhibition series of Mesozoic and Tertiary plants is now practically finished. In order to test the advantages of mounting fossils upon tiles, the historical collection of fossils in the department of geology was mounted in this manner. The results are considered to be quite satisfactory. Although the tiles are necessarily somewhat heavy, they are found to possess decided advantages over paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The study series of invertebrate fossils has received attention, but much remains to be done before an intelligent selection can be made for the final exhibition series.
NAT MUS 96 m

A considerable amount of vertebrate material is nearly ready for installation in the exhibition series, and additional space for this purpose is much needed. ; .
A great deal of detail work has been accomplished in connection with the exhibition series in the department of minerals, and as a result the appearance of the collections is much improved.
In the department of geology the historical series, the voleanic and elementary series, and the collections illustrating rock weathering and glaciation have been entirely rearranged. A large amount of work has also been done in the hall devoted to the economic series. That portion of the geological collections which is on exhibition is, all things considered, in very good condition, although, on account of the overcrowded condition of the hall and of the cases themselves, the appearance of the collections is not all that could be desired.
In the west hall, which is devoted to the department of ethnology, are exhibited the objects connected with (1) Negroid Africa, (2) the Malayo-Polynesian or Indo-Pacific peoples, and (3) various Asiatic peoples. All of the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican collections in the department of prehistoric anthropology have been placed upon exhibition. This work necessitated the rearrangement of the cases already devoted to objects from these countries. As many as possible of the unbroken vessels from mounds in the United States were placed upon exhibition.
The collection of boats has been overhauled, the larger ones being suspended from the ceiling. Many models of boats have been repaired.
In the east hall two new cases have been erected for the accommodation of the electrical collections and the series illustrating methods of land transportation.
The condition of the exhibition series in the section of graphic arts remains practically the same as at the close of the preceding fiscal year. Although the collection is not considered complete, it probably illustrates better than any other collection of its kind, either in this country or abroad, the technical development of the reproductive processes.
_ ‘The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects are exhibited in the east and west halls immediately adjoining the rotunda, In the northeast aleove the Egyptian collection is installed, consisting of casts and busts arranged around the walls, the mosaic from Carthage, the collection of coins and gems, the collection of Assyrian seals, and other objects installed in cases. The southeast aleove contains the AssyroBabylonian collection, including the temple tower, the serpent column of Delphi, the collection of Bibles and musical instruments, casts arranged upon the walls, statues, ete. Above both of these alcoves, casts of reliefs of the obelisk from Constantinople and a series of Hittite casts are exhibited. The southwest alcove contains objects of Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, while the Graeco-Roman,
Jewish, and Mohammedan collections are installed in the northwest alcove.

During the year nearly 150 requisitions for printing labels and blanks were received from the various departments in the Museum.
There were printed on the Museum press 74,831 labels, representing eight hundred and three forms; 49,000 blanks, representing twentytwo forms; 6,047 circulars, representing twelve forms; and 6,090 copies, representing thirty-six forms, of other matter, making a total of 135,968 copies.
At the Government Printing Office there were printed upon requisition by the Museum 52,200 blanks and circulars, representing ten forms, and 31,772 labels, representing one hundred and eighty-one forms, making a total of 83,972 copies.
The librarian, Dr. Cyrus Adler, states that the accessions during the past year have been as follows: Periodicals, 5,542; books, 810; pamphlets, 1,209; total, 7,561. From the accessions to the library of the Smithsonian Institution there have been retained tor the use of the Museum 7,596 periodicals, 333 books, and 1,047 pamphlets, making a total of 8,976. A list of the accessions to the Museum library by gift and exchange will be found in Appendix III,
The number of books borrowed during the year was 7,182, while 5,330 were returned, about 1,800 having been retained in the sectional libraries. Nearly 1,200 books were bound, of which, however, only about 200 belonged to the National Museum. Owing to lack of funds, it was impossible to have any more Museum books bound, although a large number require binding.
The transter of the periodical record to the standard library record has been continued, the new record containing at the close of the fiscal year 4,500 cards. There are 6,000 cards in the standard catalogue of books other than periodicals.
It is the desire of the hbrarian to have the catalogue unified, but the pressure of current work has been so great that progress in this direction has necessarily been slow.
There has been no change in the number of sectional libraries since the last report, the list being as follows:
1. Administration. 12. Marine invertebrates.
2. Birds. 13. Materia medica.
3. Botany. 14. Mesozoie fossils.
4. Comparative anatomy. 15. Mineralogy.
5. Ethnology. 16. Mollusks.
6. Fishes. 17. Oriental antiquities and reli 7. Geology. gious ceremonials.
8. Helminthology. 18. Paleobotany.
9. Historical collections. 19. Photography.
10. Insects. 20. Prehistoric anthropology. 11. Mammals. 21. Reptiles.

The Report of the Museum for 1893 was published early in the year, and the papers in the appendix have appeared in separate form. The Report for 1894 is nearly all in type and much work has been accomplished in the preparation of the volume for 1895.
Volume xvi of the Proceedings was distributed in July, and active progress has been made in printing and distributing the separate papers in Volume xvii. Nos. 1033 to 1082, with three exceptions, have appeared, and also paper No. 1032, belonging to Volume XVII, but not received from the press in time for distribution before the close of last year. Volume xvitt, in bound form, will probably be ready for distribution in the autumn, Advance sheets of the following papers have

<<<Page: 68>>>

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a”
been published: No. 1087, ‘‘ Preliminary description of a new genus and two new species of Crustaceans from an artesian well at San Marcos, Tex.,” by James E. Benedict; No. 1088, ‘Description of a new genus and species of Blind Tailed Batrachian from the subterranean waters of Texas,” by Leonhard Stejneger; No. 1103, ‘Preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United States,” by Edgar A. Mearns. Manuscripts of fourteen additional papers to be published in the Proceedings were in the hands of the printer at the close of the fiscal year, and nineteen more have been accepted for publication.
The following additional parts of Bulletin 39 have been issued: Part H, “ Directions for collecting minerals,” by Wirt Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Direetions for collecting rocks and for the preparation of thin sections,” by George P. Merrill; Part J, ‘Directions for collecting specimens and information illustrating the aboriginal uses of plants,” by Frederick V. Coville; Part K, ‘‘ Directions for collecting and preparing fossils,” by Charles Schuchert.
Circular 47, in regard to the identification of mollusks by the National Museum, has been issued.
The titles of all the papers which have appeared in the form of separates during the year are given in Appendix V.
Bulletin No. 47, “The Fishesof North and Middle America: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Species of Fish-like Vertebrates found in the Waters of North America North of the Isthmus of Panama,” by David Starr Jordan and Barton Warren Evermann, a volume of 1,240 pages, is entirely in type and will be shortly put to press. The present Bulletin constitutes Part 1 of the work. <A second volume of text and an atlas of plates will be published later.
Bulletin No. 49, “A Bibliography of the Published Writings of Philip Lutley Sclater, F. R.S., Secretary of the Zoological Society of London,” prepared under the direction of Dr. G. Brown Goode, has been set in type. It contains 135 pages, with a portrait of Dr. Sclater as a frontispiece. Mucheare has been given to the typography, with a special view to securing compactness and clearness. This work is not included in the series of Bibliographies of American Naturalists, of which five have been published (Bulletins 20, 23, 30, 40, and 41), since the scope of this Series is necessarily limited to the work of naturalists living in the United States; but, inasmuch as Dr. Sclater’s contributions to the systematic ornithology of the American continent have exceeded in extent those of anyone living in this country, it was deemed proper that the U. 8S. National Museum should publish his bibliography.
It was hoped that the second and third numbers of the Special Bulletin, the first of which appeared in 1892, would be ready for distribution before the end of the year, but owing to certain unavoidable delays this was impossible. No. 2 of the series, entitled ‘“ Oceanie Ichthyology: A Treatise on the Deep-sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, based

chiefly upon the collections made by the Steamers Blake, Albatross, and Fish Hawk in the Northwestern Atlantic,” by George Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, is an elaborate work of 553 pages, in quarto form, with an atlas of 417 figures arranged on 123 plates. The work of composition on Special Bulletin No. 3, which was partly put in type last year, has been completed, and the Bulletin is now ready for the press. This Bulletin constitutes the second volume of “The Life Histories of North American Birds,” by Maj. Charles Bendire, and relates only to land birds, extending, in the classification given in the checklist of the American Ornithologists’ Union, from the parrots to the erackles. The volume will contain 518 pages, and will be illustrated by seven chromo-lithographic plates of birds’ eggs.
A number of specimens of the genus Vespertilio were sent to Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., of the Department of Agriculture, for use in connection with the preparation of a monograph of that genus. Three specimens of Cuniculus were also lent to Mr. Miller for illustration in a forthcoming paper on the voles and their allies. Over two hundred specimens of North American weasels were sent to Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Mass., for use in connection with a revision of the eastern weasels.

Wortman, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, for comparison with fossil remains, and eighteen specimens of weasels were sent to Mr. V. Bailey, of the Department of Agriculture, for use in a revision of North American weasels. A large collection of starfishes from the West Indies was sent to Prof, A. EB. Verrill, Peabody Museum, New Haven, Conn., for study in connection with the preparation of a report upon the starfishes of that region ; a Specimen of amphipod (Orangonyx flagellatus, Benedict) was transmitted to the Rev. T. R. R. Stebbing, Tunbridge Wells, England, who desired to make a special study of the genus, and a small collection of crayfishes was sent to Dr. Walter Faxon, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., who is preparing a report on the crayfishes added to the collection in the National Museum during recent years.
From the department of birds material has been sent out as follows: A skin of Passerella iliaca megarhyncha to Mr. F. Stephens, Witch Creek. Cal., for use in determining a new subspecies from that State; a skin of young Tern to Mr. George H.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Atl
Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army, continued his study of the interesting and valuable collection of mammals, obtained by himself and Mr. F. X. Holzner on the Mexican boundary, with a view to publishing an elaborate paper based upon this material. On account of the valuable service which he has rendered to the Museum he was accorded all of the privileges enjoyed by a regular curator in the prosecution of his work. Advance editions of two papers by Dr. Mearns have been published during the year, one of which is entitled ‘‘ Preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United States,” and the other ‘“‘ Preliminary description of anew subgenus and six new species and subspecies of hares from the Mexican boundary of the United States.”
In the department of birds Mr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, was engaged for a time in certain investigations; Mr. L. M. Loomis, of the California Academy of Sciences, studied various Pacific Coast species of Shearwaters, Gulls, and. Horned Owls; Dr. Louis P. Bishop, New Haven, Conn., studied the Western Night Hawks, Bitterns, Horned Larks, Song Sparrows, ete., in connection with specimens which he collected in North Dakota; Mr. G.S. Miller, jr., of this city, made an examination of the Mexican Jays of the genus Aphelosoma; Mr. Witmer Stone, of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, inquired into the status of various Horned Owls; Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Department of Agriculture, made an investigation of the Downy Woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens and subspecies) and arranged several families of neotropical Passeres in the study series; Mr. R. M. Anderson, Forest City, lowa, spent two or three days in examining species of North American birds, and Mr. J. H. Riley and Mr. C. G. Rorebeck, Falls Church, Va., were occupied for several months in performing volunteer work and in familiarizing themselves with the birds of North America.
Although no one has been engaged in a regular course of study in the department of mollusks, many persons have been permitted to examine specimens in the study collection, and have received verbal information from the curator or his assistants. Dr. R. R. Gurley having been requested by the Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, to prepare a monograph of the American Graptolites, all the facilities which the Museum affords in this direction were placed at his disposal. Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass., spent some time at the Museum, in April, looking over the Paleozoic Cephalopoda, and Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of Natural History, studied the skulls of Titanotherium.
Miss Etta Braly and Miss Amanda Braly were engaged for about two months comparing the insects collected by them in Arkansas with species in the Museum collection. The former had in view the preparation of a list of the Coleoptera found in that State, and the latter the preparation of a list of the Hemiptera.

Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University of America, made frequent visits to the herbarium for the purpose of conducting investigations in certain orders; Prof. C. F. Wheeler, of the Michigan Agricultural College, spent several weeks in the spring of 1896 studying the genus Carex; Dr. N. L. Britton, of Columbia College, New York City, was engaged in the herbarium about the same time in making critical observations on certain eastern species; Mr. C. 8. Sargent, Jamaica Plain, Mass., examined tiie Conifere and Palmacee, and Mrs. EK. G. Britton, of New York City, was engaged for about two weeks in May in the study of mosses, especially those from Alaska.
Dr. Theodore Gill has had access to the collections of fishes while prosecuting his work upon the families and their relationship. Prof B. W. Evermann, of the United States Fish Commission, has examined the collections in the same department in connection with his work upon material recently collected by the Commission, and also in connection with the preparation of Bulletin 47 of the United States National Museum entitled “The Fishes of North and Middle America,” by David S. Jordan and B. W. Evermann. ‘This work was nearly all in type at the close of the fiscal year. Prof. A. E. Verrill, New Haven, Conn., who is engaged in the preparation of a report on the West Indian starfishes, spent about a week in the laboratory of the department of marine invertebrates, during which time he identified a large number of specimens, and selected others which he desired to have sent to him for more critical examination.
Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the United States Geological Survey, was engaged for a time in an investigation of the fluorescence of wollastonite, and Prof. R. L. Packard has continued to make use of the collections in the department of geology.
Dr. W. J. Hoffman of this city has prepared for publication a paper on the ‘Graphic Art of the Eskimos,” the work being based upon a study of the collections in the Museum. Mr. J. D. McGuire, Ellicott City, Md., who published a paper in the Report for 1894, entitled “Primitive Methods of Drilling,” has been engaged during the present fiscal year in the study of the pipes used by the American aborigines, with a view to the preparation of a paper on that subject. Dr. J. Hampden Porter has in course of preparation a paper on the foods of primitive people, and has made use of the Museum collection in this connection. Mr, H. A. Hazen of this city was granted the privilege of examining the collection of kites. Dr. J.

Prof, Charles Valentine Riley, honorary curator of the department of insects in the United States National Museum, died September 14, 1895.
The following is an extract from a biographical sketch by the Assistant Secretary, read at the annual meeting of the Joint Commission of the Scientific Societies of Washington, January 18, 1896, and afterwards published in Science:!
Professor Riley was born in Chelsea, London, September 18, 1843. His schoolboy days were passed in France and Germany, and he was but 17 when his restless spirit led bim to America.
“He went West and settled with Mr. G. H. Edwards, whom he had met in London and who had made arrangements to open a stock farm in Kankakee County, Il. Here, during three years, he acquired that experience of Western agriculture that can be gained only by farm work. Fond of all life as manifested on the farm, young Riley devoted himself enthusiastically to the calling he had chosen. Of an inquiring and experimental turn of mind, he aimed to improve on the methods in vogue, and soon won the esteem of all who knew him; and, though so young, was sought for in counsel and honored at public gatherings, at which he became intimate with Emory Cobb and other prominent farmers of Illinois. Under these circumstances, and with a deep love of nature in all her manifestations, it was no wonder that Professor Riley, as we have heard him avow, looked back to the farming days in Illinois as the happiest of his life,
“The experience gained on the farm enabled him, more than anything else, to understand the position and needs of the farmer. In writing of Professor Riley’s farm life and the reasons why he abandoned it, a Kankakee friend who knew him well remarks: ‘Young Riley was simply too enthusiastic and too bent on excelling in everything. He took no rest. Often he would be up, actually getting breakfast ready, to relieve the women folk, and milk half a dozen cows, before the others were about. When others were resting at noon in the shade, he would be working at his flowers under a July sun, There was not a sick animal of the three hundred on the place that he did not understand and help. He kept a lot of bees, got hold of the best bred colts, and some of the best heifers in the county, secured a good quarter-section, and spent his Sundays reading, sketching, and studying insects. Three years of this unceasing effort under the trying climatic extremes of central Illinois broke the young fellow’s health, for it was a great contrast to his previous life, and with every one telling him that he was wasting his talents, he finally concluded to give up the idea of farming. But had his health not failed him, my opinion is that he would be a farmer to-day, and a successful one too, for he has intense love of rural life.’
“He went to Chicago in his twentieth year, with no definite trade or profession and with little experience of city life. Money was scarce among farmers in those days, and his little property was so invested that it was not available. The trials of his first few months in Chicago are familiar to only a few of his intimate friends, but the manner in which he overcame them while yet in poor health was characteristic. Pride prevented him from asking help from his Kankakee friends, but did not prevent him from donning blue overalls and doing manual labor in a porkpacking establishment, or from adding to his slender income by making portraits of fellow boarders, or sketches which he himself disposed of at evening in the abodes of wealth on Michigan avenue. After a while he obtained an engagement as a reporter on the Evening Journal, but finally became connected with the Prairie
‘Vol, 111 (N.S.), No. 59, 1896, pp. 1-8.

<<<Page: 78>>>

Farmer, then the leading agricultural paper of the West. Besides a close application to the duties of his position as reporter, delineator, and editor of the entomological department of this paper, he devoted his time and energies to the study of botany and entomology. His industry and versatility soon made him not only popular with his associates upon the paper, but gave him a widespread reputation as a writer upon natural history, especially on his specialty of economic entomology, the importance of which he soon made apparent.” !
His adventurous temperament led him to enlist as a private in the One hundred and thirty-fourth Illinois Volunteers, in which he served for several months during the civil war, in Kentucky and Tennessee.
Before entering the army he had made the acquaintance of the man whom he joined in 1868 in establishing the American Entomologist. This friend, who was senior editor until his death, was Dr. Benjamin D. Walsh, State Entomologist of Ilnois, and it was Walsh to whom Riley always alluded as his master and the man to whom he was most indebted for his early training and inspiration. Mr. Walsh was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, in the class with Darwin, a inan of weight and scholarly attainments and a most careful and painstaking investigator. During the few years of his residence in Illinois he had done much to develop the interest in economic entomology, which resulted in the establishment of the position of State Entomologist of Missouri in 1868, which was the beginning of Riley’s public labors.
An important outgrowth of Riley’s personal activity in connection with his official work was the formation of the Riley collection of insects, upon which he began immediately after he left the army in 1864, and which at the end of twenty-five years included over 20,000 species and over 115,000 mounted specimens, besides much other material. The collection is in many respects unijue, especially so because of the complete manner in which the life-history of numerous individual species is represented. It is the legitimate outgrowth and complement of Riley’s investigations, and is a voucher for the accuracy and fullness of his personal work in entomology. This collection he gave in 1882, without condition, to the National Museum, at that time without a collection of insects. His purpose in doing this was to place iz the Museum a worthy nucleus, and to be instrumental in the formation of a collection which would be worthy of the nation. He was appointed at once honorary curator of the department of insects in the Museum, and gave much attention to the department, which thereafter made rapid advances.
It was as an economic entomologist that Riley was most widely famed. In this field he was eminent in two respects—in administration as well as in his direct contributions to the science of practical entomology, and to the art which is its outgrowth.
As an administrator, he was associated with three promineut undertakings: The entomological work of the State of Missouri, the United States Entomological Commission, and the establishment of the Division of Entomology of the Department of Agriculture.
He held the position of entomologist to the State of Missouri for nearly ten years, entering upon this work at the age of 23.
The United States Entomological Commission was in existence for five years, Riley having been its chief from the beginning.
“We all remember,” said the Pacific Rural Press in 1887, ‘‘ the sad experiences which our Western States and Territories passed through from 1873 to 1877, from locust or grasshopper ravages, which resulted in destitution and precipitated a financial crisis. These ravages seliously affected the western portion of his own State, and Professor Riley took hold of the problem with that originality and vigor which have characterized all of his work. His last three reports to the State contain the first positive and accurate knowledge on the subject that has been published.
1 Colman’s Rural World, St. Louis, May 12, 1892.

<<<Page: 79>>>

But he early saw that the subject was one of national importance and could not be fully dealt with by work in any one State. To feel a necessity was sufficient for him to act, and consequently we find him, in public lectures, in leading articles, through resolutions offered at societies’ meetings, memorials to Congress, and in every other way urging the creation of a National Entomological Commission. After various hills had been introduced and discussed, Congress finally created the Entomological Commission, with a special view to investigating the Rocky Mountain Locust, or so-called grasshopper, and Professor Riley was tendered the position as chief of the Commission, a distinction which his investigations into this insect had justly earned, for he had already not only made most important discoveries as to its habits and the best means of subduing it, but had ascertained sundry laws that govern it, so as to be able to predict the time of its coming and going and the limits of its spread. Consulted by Secretary Schurz as to the other appointments, it is no wonder that the members chosen were Dr. A. 8S. Packard, jr., a naturalist of eminence, one of the finest entomologists of the world, and a prominent author and editor, and Prof. Cyrus Thomas, who had likewise labored for the creation of the Commission, and who was the authority on the family of insects to which the locusts belonged. Both of these gentlemen, like Professor Riley, had been chosen by their respective States as official entomologists, and had a large personal experience in the West. Accepting charge of the Commission thus constituted in March, 1877, we find Riley traveling that year over most of the western country, from the Gulf to the South Saskatchawan, in British America, now in company with the governor of the State, and again with other special officials, but everywhere exhorting the farmers to action, making careful observations and experiments, and inspiring confidence.”
He was the first to demonstrate the practicability of checking the ravages of an important species of insect by enlisting the aid of the insect enemies which had kept itin check in its native habitat. This was effected by the introduction from Australia in 1888, at his instance and by two agents sent out from his office, of the Australian Vedalia, a species of lady-bird, which is the natural enemy of the ‘‘ Fluted Seale,” an insect which had found its way from southern Australia to California, and was fast destroying the orange and lemon groves.
His studies in connection with Phylloxera, the French vine pest, although not more important than many others more purely American in interest, may well be referred toon accountof the attention which they attracted in France, and the honors conferred upon him as a result. To him is generally attributed the idea of reviving etiolated French vineyards by using certain American Phylloxera-proof stocks to graft upon.
As long ago as 1873 the vine growers of France presented him with a gold medal, struck in recognition of his investigations into the history of the Phyllorera. In 1889, as a further proof of their appreciation of his services, they presented to him a beautiful statue in bronze, while the French Government conferred upon him the cross of the Legion of Honor.
Associated prominently with his name are certain practical methods for the destruction of insects: the use of kerosene emulsions to protect plants and trees from the attacks of suctorial insects, and the invention and perfection, aided by Mr. W. S. Barnard, of a very ingenious series of mechanical devices for spraying insecticides and fungicides in a liquid form—often called the Riley system.
The vast amount of work which Professor Riley accomplished is shown by the catalogue of his published papers, of which there are more than 1,600, many of them of very considerable extent, and the whole equivalent to at least 20,000 octavo pages.
Professor Riley bequeathed to the United States National Museum, through a trustee, all entomological and other natural history specimens which had come into his possession during reccnt years. A large collection of his pamphlets, relating to the subject of entomology, has been deposited in the Museum by Mrs. Riley.

Mr. R. S. Matthews, aid in the department of mammals, died on on November 13, 1895, in Atlanta, Ga., where he had been detailed for duty in connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition. Although Mr. Matthews had been connected with the Museum only a short time, he had shown marked ability, and would have undoubtedly become a naturalist of prominence.
Mr. R. Edward Earll, editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins, died on March 19, 1896. The following brief account of his life, prepared by the Assistant Secretary, is reprinted from Science: !
Mr. Robert Edward Earll, who died on March 19, at Chevy Chase, near Washington, was one of the oldest and most trusted members of the staff of the Smithsonian Institution, with which he had been connected in various capacities since 1877. He was born at Waukegan, Ill., August 24, 1853, educated in the Waukegan public schools, the University of Chicago, and at the Northwestern University, where he was graduated in 1877 with the degree of B.S. He entered the service of the Fish Commission, under Professor Baird, as a fish culturist; in 1878 was transferred to thescientifice staft, and from 1879 to 1882 was engaged in the fisheries division of the Tenth Census.
From 1885 to 1888 he was chief of the division of statistics in the Fish Gommission. He was sent in 1883 to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London, as a member of the staff of the United States Commissioner, and rendered very efficient seryice as executive officer and deputy representative. His aptitude for exposition work was so fully demonstrated on this occasion that he has been designated chief executive officer at all the expositions which have since been held, for the exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Maseum—at Louisville and New Orleans in 1884 and 1885, Cincinnati in 1888, Chicago, in 1893, and Atlanta in 1895. At the time of his death he had just completed the unpacking of the exhibits returned from the South.
Since 1888 he had been connected with the National Museum, with the grade of curator, and for three years had been editor of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum.
He was recognized by his associates as a man of fine administrative ability, which, combined with great force of character, had brought him into the position of one of the most efficient expositiou experts living. His unselfish devotion to his work and his absolute trustworthiness were appreciated by all who knew him, and he was exceedingly popular among his associates.
Notwithstanding his constant occupation in executive work, he produced and published a considerable number of important papers in regard to the methods of the fisheries and the habits of dishes. He was one of the best authorities upon the natural history of the shad and herring, and made exhaustive studies of the fishery statisties of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and of the Great Lakes. Several new fishes were discovered by him, one of which, an important food species of the southern coast, obtained by him at Charleston in 1881, is called in his honor Earll’s hake, Phycis earlii. He was also a skillful fish culturist, and had much experience in the early experimental work in the propagation of the shad and in the establishment of the cod hatching station at Gloucester.
He was a man of the purest personal character. His loss will be deeply felt by many in Washington. By reason of his peculiar abilities and his great experience, his death creates a yoid which it will be practically impossible to fill.

IlI.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.
During the early part of the fiscal year the curators of many of the departments were engaged in completing the preparation of their exhibits for the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, Ga. This Exposition opened on September 18 and continued until the close of the year 1895, Another month or more was required for the return of the exhibits and their installation in the Museum, so that for at least one-half of the period covered by the present report the curators were occupied more or less with Exposition matters. This is usually the case, however, during those years in which Expositions occur, and as the resulting disadvantages have been dwelt upon in previous reports, no extended reference to them need be made at this time. Nevertheless, it is gratifying to state that satisfactory progress has been made in all the departments, notwithstanding the difficulties encountered. The record of the present year compares favorably with that of other years in which similar conditions existed.
As stated in the last Annual Report, the curator, Mr. F. W. True, was detailed in May, 1895, to accompany an expedition to Alaska and the adjacent islands for the purpose of studying the seal rookeries. While thus engaged he was attached to the staff of the United States Fish Commission. |
The most interesting accessions to the collections of this department have been received from Dr. W. L. Abbott, who for several years has forwarded very large and valuable collections of mammals, birds, ete., from various parts of Africa and Asia. His contributions in the present year consisted of valuable skins of lemurs and other small mammals from Madagascar, and a collection from Kashmir, including a stag and amusk. In all, ninety-two specimens were received from him.
About forty skins of the very rare mole Neiirotrichus gibbsii, from British Columbia, were purchased by the Museum. Eighty-eight mammals from the Pribilof Islands, ineluding fifteen fur-seals, were collected by the curator (while in the service of the Fish Commission) and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr. A mounted skin of the Chile deer, Cariacus chilensis, was presented by the La Plata Museum. Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., collected fourteen small mammals in Margarita Island
and La Guayra, Venezuela. These he kindly presented to the National 50

<<<Page: 82>>>

Museum. About fifty mammals, which died from the effects of confinement in the National Zoological Park, have been received. They were chiefly representatives of North American species. From Dr. EK. A. Mearns, U.S. A., were received several small mammals from Fort Clark, Tex., and Fort Myer, Va., and Prof. R. E. Call donated between three and four hundred bats, which he obtained from the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky.
Mr. True states that, while the accumulations of the year included some very valuable specimens, so far as scientific value is concerned, the general average is probably below that of the last three or four years. The number of specimens received is also less. There were fifty different contributors, four of which were Government Bureaus. The total number of specimens received and entered was 1,048, including 365 bats of one or two species only.
Very little work was accomplished in the exhibition hall, owing to the absence of the curator. A considerable number of specimens were withdrawn for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, but these were returned before the expiration of the fiscal year.
Regarding the study collections the curator says:
The study series has not degenerated, so far as I am aware. A large number of skins have been taken from the vats and made up dry, and many old but valuable skins have been made over. From the want of an assistant, little has been done towards classifying and putting away the larger skins.
There are still many skins of the larger species which are in very bad form for study purposes and ought to be made over, so that they can be handled. At present they are stored in boxes.
New cases were provided in the third-story laboratory, but little has yet been put into them.
Some progress was made in transferring the valuable study series of small skulls from trays to boxes, but more remains to be done.
The alcoholics have been looked after and roughly classified in the alcohol room, but the lack of an assistant made it impossible to do much in that direction.
A paper entitled ‘“ Revision of the American Moles,” by the curator, was completed and sent to press during the year. He has also con. tinued his work on the “ Antlers of the Deer Family,” although this has been constantly interrupted by special assignment to executive duties.
The curator calls attention in his report to several explorations which have resulted in the acquisition of some very desirable material. Thus, Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., was detailed to accompany the curator to the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, in the summer of 1895, and in the three months spent there they collected eighty-eight mammals, a large number of plants, some anatomical specimens, insects, birds, and other natural-history objects. Among the mammals are fifteen fur-seals of varying ages, including a very fine old bull. Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has continued his travels in Kashmir, sent some very interesting mammals to the Museum from that country. He also made a collecting trip in southeastern Madagascar, and as a result a splendid series of skins of

<<<Page: 83>>>

lemurs and of the insectivores peculiar to that island were added to the Museum collections. Prof. R. E. Call explored the caves of Kentucky and obtained in the Mammoth Cave a large number of bats for the Museum. Mr. William Palmer made an expedition to the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, and collected a few mammals.
It is pleasant to refer here to the enthusiastic cooperation of Dr, BE. A. Mearns, U. S. A. Both in the field and in the laboratory his energies and intelligent aid have been of very great value to the Museum.
Three papers based upon collections made by Dr. Mearns and Mr. F. X. Holzner have been published by the Museum. These contain descriptions of eighteen new species and subspecies.
The curator thus outlines the general course which it seems desirable to follow in the future in connection with the development of this department:
The collections of mammals made by the Department of Agriculture in the last few years being cited in the publications of that Department as belonging to the National Museum, it is taken for granted that they do now and always will form a part of the Government collections of the Museum. Such being the case, it seems inadvisable to spend money in procuring North American mammals at this time, except of such species as are not collected by the Department of Agriculture or of which specimens are needed for exhibition purposes.
On the other hand, all kinds of foreign mammals ate greatly to be desired. The tendency of work in America at present is to follow broader lines than hitherto, and the foreign species are needed for comparison with our own.
We ought to be on the lookout, furthermore, to secure specimens of large foreign species which are threatened with extinction. Some which were obtainable twentyfive years ago are no longer to be had.
Additions to the groups of North American mammals are in view, but there is great discouragement in this direction, it being impossible at the present time to find exhibition space for five groups already prepared. A fur-seal group is now being provided for.
Mr. True, in addition to his duties as curator of mammals, has served during the year as chairman of the Committee on Publications, and has frequently been called upon to act as Executive Curator in matters affecting the general administration of the Museum.
The department suffered a severe loss in the death of Mr. R. 8S. Matthews, which occurred on November 13, 1895.
The appended statement shows the number of specimens in the collection and the number of catalogue entries made during the year:

During the year just closed a large proportion of the time of the curator, Mr. Robert Ridgway, has been devoted to the prosecution of his work on the ‘“ Birds of North and Middle America.” In a special report regarding the progress of this work he makes the following statement:
There have been completed during the year the synonymy, family diagnoses, and concomitant matter pertaining to 54 families, 335 genera, and 1,061 species. During the preceding period since the work was commenced 15 families, 165 genera, and 747 species were covered.
This statement does not by any means show the proportion of the work which has actually been completed, since a large number of genera and individual species, thoroughly ‘‘ worked up” in other connections, are in shape for the printer. How many and what proportion of the whole these would represent, it is, however, impossible to estimate.
At the present rate of progress the synonymatie portion of the work will be completed by December, 1896—possibly sooner. Much of the most difficult portion of the task will then be out of the way. In the meantime a determined effort will be made to thoroughly rearrange the collection, so as to facilitate access to the specimens, and then the finishing touches will be given the work without unnecessary delay.
Other investigations carried on by the curator included a study of the genera of the Tringillide; a study of the affinities of Procnias viridis; a partial compilation of a list of type specimens in the department of birds; determinations of some-Galapagos species, of a species of Peucedramus trom Guatemala, and of a species of Geothlypis from Mexico. He also prepared a paper on the birds collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the Seychelles and other islands near Madagascar. The curator was detailed for two months in southern Florida, for the purpose of studying the bird life of that region.
The routine work has devolved very largely on Mr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant curator. The latter has determined collections of birds made by Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, in eastern Turkestan, and in Madagascar. He has also commenced the study of a collection of birds from Kast Africa, a collection of birds from Margarita Island, Venezuela, made by Lieut. Wirt Robinson, and a series from eastern Mexico.
The number of specimens received during the year was about 3,000

<<<Page: 85>>>

in excess of the receipts for the preceding year, the number of accessions or “lots” of material having been eighty-six. The scientific value of the accessions for the year just closed exceeded that for the year 1894-95, including, as they did, a rare and extinct parrot (Nestor productus), presented by Dr. W. L. Ralph; one species doubifully extinct, many types of new species, and a number of rare specimens. Specimens or collections of unusual importance have been received from more than forty individuals and establishments during the year. The list of important contributors for the preceding year was headed by Mr. A. Boucard, Isle of Wight, England. He has been a very generous contributor, having presented during this year more than 2,800 specimens from various parts of the world. His liberality toward the Museum is very highly appreciated.
Among other important accessions the following may be mentioned: From Dr. W. L. Abbott, 217 specimens, representing 85 species, from Madagascar, and 67 specimens, mainly eagles and hawks, from Kashmir (gift); Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, 167 specimens from Margarita Island, Venezuela, and Bogota, Colombia, including types of 11 species (gift); Rev. H. T. Heyde, 1404 Erato street, New Orleans, La., 183 bird skins from Central America (purchase); H. P. Attwater, San Antonio, Tex., 367 specimens from Texas (purchase); Dr. A. Fényes, Hélouan, Egypt, 79 specimens from Egypt (gift); 190 birds collected by Robert Ridgway, in Florida and other States, for the U.S. National Museum; 8S. Dannefaerd, New Zealand, 9 specimens from Chatham and Snares Islands (purchase); F. Stephens, Witch Creek, Cal., type of Speotyto cunicularia obscura (gift); William Brewster, Cambridge, Mass., 141 specimens from Mexico and Lower California (gift); Charles KE. Kern, Washington, D. C., 85 specimens from Costa Rica and Nicaragua (gift); F. W. True, U. S. National Museum, and D. W. Prentiss, jr., Washington, D. C., 142 specimens collected in Alaska; Richard C. McGregor, Palo Alto, Cal., 119 birds from California and Colorado.
The material received during the year has been catalogued and distributed in the various series of the collection, and a considerable number of unidentified species have been determined. Mr.J.H. Riley, of Falls Church, Va., gave his services gratuitously for about six mouths, during which time valuable assistance was rendered in the matter of cataloguing. Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Department of Agriculture, has been engaged for a year or more in rearranging the neotropical series, and several families of Passeres have received attention. This work is also done gratuitously, and has been performed outside of office hours.
Mr. Ridgway states that a large amount of incidental work has been performed, such as furnishing information of a technical character in response to requests received through the mail ; the preparation of a card catalogue of the sectional library; the preparation of data relating to the type material in the department, and the reading of proof

and the verification of references in the Bibliography of Dr. P. L. Sclater, which will shortly be published by the Museum as No. 49 of the Bulletin.
A number of additional cases for the storage of specimens have been provided. Several of these cases will be placed in the west basement, and the remainder in the gallery. The extensive additions to the collections during the last two or three years have rendered an entire rearrangement necessary. Such a readjustment is made the more urgent by the fact that the collections in the west basement are more or less inaccessible, and to some extent exposed to the ravages of insects. That portion of the study series which is installed in the bird gallery is in good condition.
The material exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta was returned and placed in position during the year.
Mr. Richmond made a collecting trip to Smiths Island, Va., and Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, collected birds in Florida. Explorations resulting in additions to the collections have also been undertaken by twenty-four other persons, the names of some of them having already been mentioned in this review. The names of the others will be found in the accession list (Appendix 11).
Material for investigation has been sent to thirteen different individuals and establishments, and eight persons not connected with the Museum have visited the building and made use of the collections.
Thirty-six papers based upon material in this department have been published during the year by the curator, assistant curator, and other collaborators. In these papers one new family, four new genera, and thirty-four new species and subspecies are described.
The number of specimens received, including those added to the Department of Agriculture collection, was 8,488. This is the first year in which any large number of specimens from the Department of A griculture have been entered. Although the material is the property of the Museum, it is, as a matter of convenience, installed and catalogued separately for the present. The total number of specimens in the collection is now over 86,000. The addition of the duplicates would bring the figures up to about 100,000.
The catalogue entries for the year were as follows:

The honorary curator of this department, Maj. Charles Bendire, States that the number of accessions was slightly less than during the preceding year, but that the scientific value of the material received

<<<Page: 87>>>

during both years was about equal. The largest accession was from Dr. W. L. Ralph, Utiea, N. Y., who has long been regarded as one of the most valued contributors to the Museum. This collection consisted of 88 nests and 911 eggs, representing 206 species. Other important contributions were received from the following: Dr. James ©. Merrill, United States Army, Fort Sherman, Idaho, 6 nests and 99 eggs, representing 12 species; Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, Cambridge, Mass., 5 nests and 65 eggs, representing 14 species; United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross, through Mr, F. W. True and D. W. Prentiss, jr., 35 specimens, representing 10 species; Elmer J. Judd, Cando, N. Dak., 25 eggs, representing 3 species; United States Department of Agriculture, 32 specimens, representing 8 species. Twenty-eight eggs and 6 nests were purchased from Mr. H. P. Attwater, San Antonio, Tex.
All of the material received has been properly catalogued and labeled, and the exhibition and study series are in excellent condition. It would be very desirable to increase the former if the necessary space were available.
The honorary curator mentions the names of thirty-five persons whose cooperation has resulted in enriching the collections. The Department of Agriculture and the United States Fish Commission have also made valuable contributions to the collections of this department.
The number of eggs received during the year was 1,729, and of nests 154. The last catalogue entry in June, 1595, was 27655, and in June, 1896, 28138.
As stated in the last annual report, the curator of this department, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, was detailed in the spring of 1895 to accompany a Government expedition to Alaska and the adjacent islands for the purpose of studying the seal rookeries. Dr. Stejneger was absent for a considerable portion of the fiscal year covered by the present report, and in June, 1896, he again left for the north, having been appointed by the President a member of ‘a special commission, authorized by joint resolution of Congress, to investigate the condition of the seal herds. For these reasons the regular operations of the department of reptiles and batrachians have been considerably interfered with.
The number of specimens received and entered on the catalogue has been smaller than during the preceding fiscal year, although this 1s partially accounted for by the fact that the year last referred to was one of unusual activity. The scientific value of the material is no less in proportion than that attaching to the accessions of the previous year, some very interesting collections having been received from South America and Madagascar, as well as from various parts of the United States. Hight specimens of a blind batrachian from an artesian well

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. sy!
at San Marcos, Tex., were received from the United States Fish Commission. They represent anew genus and species, described by Dr, Stejneger as Typhlomolge rathbuni. This is regarded as one of the most remarkable herpetological discoveries of recent years. Other accessions by gift included one from Dr. W. L. Abbott, consisting of a series of reptiles collected by him in Madagascar, and one from Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, consisting of a collection of reptiles and batrachians from La Guayra and Margarita Island. A series of reptiles and batrachians from Argentina was received from the Museo de la Plata, in exchange.
The curator’s visit to the islands in Bering Sea yielded very little in the way of collections for this department, owing to the absence of batrachians and reptiles in the localities visited. A specimen of a rare salamander (Salamandrella wossessenskii) was, however, obtained in Kamchatka. It is the only species occurring there, and had not been previously represented in the Museum collection. Mr. F. W. True secured some specimens of snakes and toads on Vancouver Island, and an interesting collection of snakes from the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, was obtained by Mr. William Palmer of the National Museum.
Regarding the condition of the various series in the department, the curator Says:
The collection was gone over systematically several times, and the alcohol “strengthened and replenished as required, The exhibition series still consists only of the separate casts, the yellow-boa group and the group of North American turtles and poisonous snakes. Thestudy series is divided into the North American series, the exotic series and the duplicates. The former are all in separate jars and bottles; a portion of the exotic series is still in storage jars, while most of the duplicates are kept in tanks.
Owing to the prolonged absence of the curator, and the fact that after his return he has been engaged principally in bringing the routine work up to date, but little has been done in the way of conducting special investigations upon the material under his care, beyond the description of the new genus and species of batrachian already referred to.
Specimens have been sent to a number of individuals for study, as indicated in the chapter devoted to transactions of that character, and special facilities were accorded to Prof. EK. D. Cope for studying material in the department in connection with his forthcoming monograph.
Among those whose cooperation has been of value to this department mention should be made of Mr. Julius Hurter, St. Louis Mo., and Mr. W. L. Sherwood, New York City.
Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by the curator during the year.
There were 329 specimens received and eutered, the last number in the catalogue on June 30, 1895, being 22482, and on June 30, 1896, 22811. The total number of specimens in the collection is estimated at over 35,000.

<<<Page: 89>>>

The number of accessions to the department of fishes during the year was not so great as during the preceding year. Their scientific value was also somewhat less. A collection of fishes from Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota was received from the United States Fish Commission; also from the same source a collection of types of fishes from the Albatross collections in the North Pacific, as well as soe material obtained by the same vessel in that locality and in Bering Sea in 1890 and 1891, A collection made by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger in Bering Sea and the vicinity of Kamchatka deserves special notice. A few specimens obtained from the Island of Yesso by Mr. Grebnitzki were also received.
The honorary curator of the department, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, is still in New York City, as superintendent of the New York Aquarium. _ Mr. Barton A. Bean, the assistant curator, states that during the year the collections have been carefully attended to, the bottled specimens having been kept covered with alcohol, and the old labels replaced by new ones where necessary. The collections on the shelves in the fish hall have been condensed by placing several specimens of the same species in one jar. Considerable additional shelf space was thus secured. Some large and valuable collections resulting from explorations in the North Pacific by the steamer Albatross were installed during the year. An unusually large number of specimens were distributed, including several sets of deep-sea fishes, which were sent to some of the principal museums in Europe.
The honorary curator and assistant curator have prepared reports upon the fishes collected in the vicinity of the Commander Islands by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. N. Grebnitzki; also upon the fishes collected by the latter in Kamchatka and Japan. At the close of the fiscal year Dr. Bean had in course of preparation a report upon the fishes collected in 1887-88 by the Albatross, in South American waters. Mr. Barton Bean is assisting in this work.
In January, 1896, Messrs. B. W. Evermann and W. A. Wilcox, of the United States Fish Commission, and Mr. Barton Bean, made an investigation of the fish and fisheries of Indian River, Florida. A report upon these investigations was made to the United States Senate.
Among the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections, those already referred to indirectly were probably of the most importance, namely, those of the steamer Albatross, in the North Pacific, of field parties sent out by the Fish Commission to the western portion of the United States, and the expedition to Florida. A small collection was also made by Rey. P. H. Sérensen, in Greenland.
Material has been sent out for study on a number of occasions, and
several ichthyologists have examined the collections in the Museum laboratory.

<<<Page: 90>>>

Dr. Theodore Gill, Associate in Zoology, has published a number of papers on fishes during the year. These are based upon Museum material, some of them containing descriptions of new species. Deseriptive papers, based on the collections, have also been published by other collaborators.
Strenuous efforts will be made to improve the condition of the collections by setting aside surplus or duplicate material. The preparation of an exhibit of deep-sea fishes, from 1,000 feet and lower, is contemplated. This exhibit, it is expected, will prove of great interest.
About 3,000 specimens were received during the year, the catalogue entries embracing Nos. 47505 to 47687, inclusive. The total number of specimens in the collection is estimated at 150,000.
The honorary curator, Dr. W. H. Dall, states that there was a slight increase in the number of. accessions during the year, the total having been 118, while the total for 1894-95 was 111. On the whole, the year has not been marked by anything unusual in the growth of the collections, although many valuable specimens were added. An excellent local collection of shells from Texas, made by Mr. J. A. Singley, was purchased with funds supplied by Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York City. Many very valuable foreign Unios, and other specimens new to the collection, were derived from the same source. In addition, some works have been purchased for the sectional library during the year through Dr. Chamberlain’s generosity. Others who have steadily contributed to the collections in this department, and who are thereby entitled to be regarded as regular contributors, are Hon. J. D. Mitchell, Victoria, Tex., who presented a number of species of Unios and other specimens from his locality; Mr. and Mrs. T. 8. Oldroyd, Los Angeles, Cal.; Mr. F. F. Crevecceur, Onaga, Kans., who sent in a number of species of land and fresh-water shells; Mr. Henry Hemphill, San Diego, Cal., from whom between thirty and forty species of marine mollusks from San Diego, and other material, was received; Mr. P. B. Randolph, Seattle, Wash., who sent many specimens from his locality; Dr. C. F. Newcombe, Victoria, B. C., from whom marine shells were received; and Dr. W. L. Abbott, who sent material from eastern Madagasear. The addition of greatest importance was the Fish Commission material transferred from the Peabody Museum, New Haven, Conn. This material has been in the hands of Prof. A. E. Verrill for some years for study, and is now being gradually transmitted to the National Museum.
As stated elsewhere, the exhibition series is in good condition, and much has been done in connection with the study series. The excellent system adopted in the installation and registration of these collections will be fully appreciated only when the entire work has been completed.

<<<Page: 91>>>

This matter is thus referred to by Dr. Dall:
The entry of additions to the collection in the register of the department has been carried on as usual. The principal item of work accomplished during the year has been the thorough revision of the basement storage room, in which alcoholics and duplicates are kept. All the bottles have been cleaned and filled up, when necessary, with additional alcohol, the contents catalogued, and each bottle given a number referring to the catalogue, which has been made on cards arranged alphabetically, so that by reference to the cards it can at once be seen whether any particular species is on hand in spirits. If so, the bottle can be reached in a moment, the jars being arranged in numerical order on the shelves. In cases where there was an excessive amount of material in alcohol, the excess has been removed, dried, and cleaned, and placed in the series of dry duplicates, of which a similar card catalogue has been made, the specimens being placed in numbered covered boxes, so that by reference to the cards any species can be reached in a few moments.
The number of jars of alcoholic specimens catalogued so far is 2,002.
The number of dry duplicates in boxes, catalogued, is 4,174 species or lots. All are in perfect order, and with a view to preserving the jars better from dust, which soils them and obscures the labels, the shelves have been provided with covers of enameled cloth. ;
There is also a considerable number of jars of alcoholics in the north tower, which it is hoped to catalogue and label in a similar manner during the coming year. When these are completed, the entire collection of alcoholics and duplicate recent shells will have been put into excellent order.
Various installments of specimens have been received from Prof. A. E. Verrill during the year. These, as they were received, have been checked off on the lists, the species segregated, and transferred to the standard sizes of tubes and papertrays. I have deferred incorporating them with the reserve collection until the whoie series shall be received, so as to make one job of the transfer, which even then will involve a great amount of work.
The series of mounted specimens, illustrating the chief families of mollusks, which was prepared by Mr. Marshall and Mr. Simpson for exhibition as part of the Museum material at the Atlanta Exposition, has been placed in one of the exhibition cases in the main hall.
We have still a large amount of unregistered material, especially in the Jeftreys collection, which will be handled from time to time, as opportunity serves, until all arrearages are made up; but in the absence of expert assistance the progress in this direction will necessarily be slow.
In order to make sure that each specimen in the collection is correctly identified, and to unify the nomenclature, a large amount of work will eventually be required. Work of this character must be performed by a specialist in each group.
Dr. Dall states that he has completed a report upon the collections of land shells made during the progress of the Mexican Boundary Survey, by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army. This collection contains the largest additions to our fauna of this region for many years. A number of additions to the fauna of the coast of Texas, collected by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, have been described or elucidated; also collections made at San Pedro, Cal., by Mr. and Mrs. T.S. Oldroyd, and in Puget Sound and vicinity, by Messrs. P. B. Randolph, of Seattle, and Dr. ©. F. Neweombe, of Victoria, British Columbia.
A discussion of the land-shell faunas of voleanie oceanic islands, forming a report on the collections made at the Galapagos Islands, by

Mr. Robert John Lechmere Guppy, Port of Spain, Trinidad, whose collection of Antillean fossils was purchased by the Museum some years ago, forwarded descriptions of some supposed new species, to be printed in the Proceedings, the types being part of the National Museum collection. The new forms have been figured, and a joint paper by Dr. Dall and Mr. Guppy, on Antillean Tertiary fossils, has been completed, and is now in the hands of the printer.
Work on the Neocene fauna of Florida has been carried on as opportunity served, and will be continued until the study is completed. Mr. Charies T. Simpson has continued his studies on the Naiades. The superficial anatomy of a considerable number of species has been examined, and notes and descriptions prepared. Much time has been spent in searching the literature and preparing cards of synonymy for use in a synopsis of the Naiades.
A number of persons have been engaged in making collections with a view to working out the fauna of their respective localities, submitting all puzzling or doubtful forms to the department for examination. These correspondents in most cases donate types of new or interesting material to the national collection. Explorations carried on by Hon. J. D. Mitchell, Victoria, Tex.; Dr. C. F. Newcombe, Victoria, British Columbia; Mr. leap 6 be erabipn. Seattle, Wash., and Mrs. T. 8S. Oldroyd, Los Angeles, Cal., were especially productive of good results. Collections were also made by F. F. Crevecceur, Onaga, Kans.; Dr. Charles L. Gwyn, Galveston, Tex.; J. A. Singley, Giddings, Tex., and the Young Naturalists’ Society, Los Angeles, Cal. Reference has already been made to the material obtained.
Dr. Dall states that during the year one hundred and forty applications for the identification of specimens, for advice as to conchological literature, ete., were received from more than one hundred different individuals. The furnishing of this information involved the identifica. tion of over three thousand species, and the writing of over one thousand pages of correspondence by the honorary curator and Mr. Simpson. It has always been the practice to grant requests for the identification of material, but the number of applications in recent years has been so great that it has become necessary to formulate a set of rules! by which individuals sending specimens for this purpose should be governed. In these regulations it is stipulated that the material must be sent free of expense to the Museum, unless otherwise agreed upon, and that the localities from which the specimens were obtained, must be given. The Museum reserves the right to retain, except under special arrangement, specimens needed to complete the national collection.
No one, other than those connected with the staff, has been engaged in a regular course of study in the department. Probably as any as
1 Cireular 47, U.S. N. M.

<<<Page: 93>>>

a hundred have, however, received verbal information or have been accorded the privilege of examining specimens in the study series.
‘Twenty-one papers, based upon material in the department, have been published by Dr. Dall, and five by Mr. Charles T. Simpson. One paper has also been published by Mr. G. D. Harris. The titles of these papers appear in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv), and in the supplements to the latter will be found the names of a large number of species described, as well as of one family and several new genera.
It is proposed to continue the work on the collections now in proeress until the arrears have been registered and catalogued, the Jef.freys and Verrill collections administered upon, and the duplicates eliminated from the reserve series. This will require a considerable amount of time, owing to the extreme pessure of current work.
The total number of specimens received during the year, exclusive of fossils, was 3,173. The number of entries made in the regular catalogues of recent mollusks was 5,449. The following paragraphs contain information as to the other clerical work performed, and also as to the present extent of the collections:
Besides the entries in the register of the reserve collection there have been 175 entries in the register of drawings, 1,628 entries in the register of duplicates, and 3,630 entries on cards for card calalogues, showing a total of 12,103 entries of all kinds during the year ending June 30, 1896.
The additions to the reserves sum up 20,010 specimens, making, when added to last year’s figures, a total of 544,398 specimens in the reserve collection. <A very low estimate of the number of duplicates will place them at 12,522 specimens. The specimens in alcohol, already catalogued, amount to 20,020, while the unregistered material will add, when catalogued, about 28,000 specimens, making a grand total of about 600,000 specimens in the department of mollusks, exclusive of fossils.
There have been several changes in the personnel of this department during the year. Prof. C. V. Riley, who had served as honorary curator since 1882, and who rendered very valuable service to the Museum, died on September 14, 1895. A biographical sketch of his life and work will be found under the head of Necrology.
Mr. L. O. Howard, who succeeded Professor Riley as entomologist of the Department of Agriculture, has been appointed honorary curator of the department of insects in the National Museum. Four honorary custodians have also been appointed during the year, each having charge of a special branch of work, as follows: Mr. W. H. Ashmead, the Hymenoptera; Mr. D. W. Coquillett, the Diptera; Prof. O. F. Cook, the Myriapoda, and Mr, E. A. Schwarz, the Coleopterous larva. Mr. M. L. Linell continues to act as aid.
The accessions during the year numbered one hundred and thirtyfive, an increase of thirty-six over the preceding year. It is believed that, taking the accessions as a whole, they were five times as valua

<<<Page: 94>>>

ble as those received in 1894-95. The most important accessions were as follows:
Collection of Arachnida of Dr. George Marx, on deposit from Mrs. Minnie Marx.
Collection of insects of all orders from Texas, made by Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and C. H. T. Townsend, and presented by the Department of Agriculture.

The biological collections in Lepidoptera have been completely rearranged in cabinet drawers, and the collection of Melanopli, lent by Dr. Scudder, and the African Lepidoptera, lent by Dr. Holland, were installed. A rearrangement of the North American Coleoptera has been commenced, the families Scarabieide and Cerambycide having already been finished. The recent accessions of Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera have been incorporated in the collections. A portion of

<<<Page: 95>>>

the exhibition series is displayed in the lower hallway leading to the offices of the department. The systematic series, since its return from the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, has been placed upon exhibition, while the exotic showy insects prepared for the same Exposition have been distributed in the study collections. The reserve collections for study are, generally speaking, in good condition. In order to properly classify the Lepidoptera, however, much work must still be done. The types have not yet been catalogued except in this order.
A large amount of scientific work has been accomplished by the members of the staff during the year, as will be seen from the following extract from Mr. Howard’s report:
The curator has published a revision of the Aphelinine of North America, and a paper on the “Grass and Grain Joint-worm Flies and their Allies,” in Technical Series Nos. 1 and 2, United States Department of Agriculture. These papers are based upon Museum material. He has also completed, but not yet published, a report on the Chalcididie of the Island of Grenada, and, conjointly with Mr. Ashmead, a brief paper on some reared parasitic Hymenoptera from Ceylon.
Mr. Ashmead has completed and published his report on the parasitic Hymenoptera of the Island of Grenada, comprising the families Cynipidw, Ichneumonide, Braconid and the Proctotrypidx, submitted by Dr. David Sharp on behalf of the committee for investigating the flora and fauna of the West Indian islands. He has also described a new genus and two new species of Proctotrypide from Trinidad, submitted by Mr. F. W. Urich; and in a paper published in the Transactions of the American Entomological Society, Philadelphia, June, 1896, he described a large number of new parasitic Hymenoptera. During the year, besides rearranging some of the families of the Aculeate Hymenoptera and Hemiptera, he identified several hundred species of Hemiptera and between two and three thousand species of Hymenoptera for correspondents of the Department of Agriculture. Monographic work is also being done on the families Braconidee, Cynipid, and Chalcidide.
Mr. Coquillett has published a revision of the North American genera and species of Empide, in which four new genera and sixty-six new species are described. Types of all of these new forms are now in the National Museum. He has also identified the Culicide in the National Museum, and described three new species in the Canadian Entomologist for February, 1896, and in a paper on the Diptera of Florida, published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for 1895, he described a new species of Platywra and one of Drosophila from specimens in the National Museum. He is now engaged in identifying the Tachinid in the National Museum collection, and has nearly completed a monograph of the same.
Mr. Linell has completed reports on the Japanese Coleoptera (Acc. 27854), on the Coleoptera of the Chanler and Héhnel expeditions, and on the insects collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott on the Indian Islands, north of Madagascar. A restudy of the North American Coleoptera of the families Scarab:eide and Cerambycids has resulted in two descriptive papers, now being published in the Proceedings of the National
Museum.
Of the explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections, nearly all were confined to localities outside of the United States. The material obtained is referred to in the list of important accessions given above, and only a brief reference will therefore be made in this place. The British West India Committee for Zoological Exploration conducted

<<<Page: 96>>>

explorations on Grenada Island; Dr. W. L. Abbott collected in Madagascar and Turkestan; the Chanler-Hoéhnel expedition to Jombéné Range, East Africa, collected insects and other material; the United States Department of Agriculture sent Messrs. EK. A. Schwarz and C. H. Tyler Townsend to Brownsville, Tex., to investigate the Cotton Boll-weevil; Dr. Leonhard Stejneger visited the Commander Islands and Kamchatka and incidentally collected a number of insects; Mr. F. W. True, of the United States National Museum, and Mr. D. W. Prentiss, jr., of this city, visited the Pribilof Islands while temporarily in the service of the United States Fish Commission; Prof. C. V. Riley and Mr. H.G. Htubbard went to the West Indies in the spring of 1895; Mr. W J McGee collected during his trip to Tiburan Island, Gulf of California, and Messrs. E. A. Schwarz and H. G. Hubbard collected in the vicinity of Salt Lake, Utah.
Material has been sent from the department to fourteen individuals, including several prominent specialists in various orders. In some cases the specimens were transmitted for identification, and in other instances they were desired for comparison. <A few investigators not connected with the Museum have made use of the collections in the department.
The honorary curator mentions the names of eight correspondents who have made contributions and who have received publications in partial exchange. Exchanges of specimens have been arranged with nine other individuals in this country and abroad, The correspondents who have sent material for identification which has been retained in the Museum number fourteen.
Thirty-three papers based upon Museum material have been published during the year by members of the staff, and seventeen by other collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). A very large number of new species are described. The names of these are given in the supplements to the Bibliography.
About 7,000 specimens were added during the year, exclusive of the Marx collection, which was received on deposit and embraces about 10,000 specimens. The last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895, was 1584, and the last on June 30, 1896, 1789, giving 205 entries for the year.
This department remains in charge of Mr. Richard Rathbun as honorary curator, with Mr. James EK. Benedict and Miss Mary J. Rathbun as assistant curators.
During the year a study of the Annelids of the west coast of tropical America was commenced, and work on a monograph of the American Brachyura and special researches on the genera Pseudothelphusa and Sesarma have been carried on. Mr. Benedict made a study of some new svecies of blind Crustacea taken from an artesian well in San Marcos,

<<<Page: 97>>>

Tex., preliminary descriptions of which have already appeared in the Proceedings. Complete descriptions will be published later. Miss Rathbun has prepared an annotated list of the Decapod Crustacea of Jamaica, for publication by the Institute of Jamaica. A paper containing descriptions of the new forms will be published in the Proceedings, and is now in press. Miss Rathbun spent about two weeks in the summer of 1895 examining literature relating to the Crustacea in the libraries of Boston and Cambridge.
There were sixty-nine accessions to this department during the year. Generally speaking, the accessions for the present year were not so large or so important as those of the preceding year, although the material received from the United States Fish Commission exceeded in value that of the accessions obtained from the same source during 1894-95.
The principal additions to the collections during the year are thus described by the curator:
From the United States Fish Commission were received six accessions, comprising a large amount of material collected by the steamer Albatross, chiefly in the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea; also the following: Crustacea collected during the cruise to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, representing groups Podophthalma, Copepoda, pelagic Schizopoda, Pantopoda and larvie of Stomatopoda; medusze and. hydroids studied by Prof. J. Walter Fewkes; Crustacea from St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, collected by Messrs. F. W. True and D. W. Prentiss, jr.; invertebrates from Kamehatka and the Commander Islands, collected by Dr. L. Stejneger, and invertebrates from Japan, collected by N. Grebnitzki. (Gift.)
From the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna, Austria, through Dr. Franz Ritter von Hauer, fourteen species of echinoderms dredged by H. M. 8. Pola in the eastern Mediterranean, 1890-1894. (Exchange.)
From the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, through Dr, Ehrenbaum, forty-six species of Crustacea from the North Sea. (Exchange.)
From Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Waterworks, South Australia, four accessions of Crustacea and other invertebrates from Australia. (Exchange. )
From Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, N. Y., through L. M. McCormick, curator, fourteen species of invertebrates from the Gulf of Aden. (Exchange. )
From Museo Nacional, San José, Costa Rica, through J. Fid. Tristan, many freshwater crabs, including several new species. (Gift.)
From H. Pittier, director, Instituto Fisico-geografico Nacional, San José, Costa Rica, twelve lots of Crustacea from Gulf of Dolce, Costa Rica, several species being rare. (Gift.)
From P. W. Jarvis, Colonial Bank, Kingston, Jamaica, specimens of crabs, including many new and rare forms. (Exchange. )
From Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, twelve species (one new) of erustaceans and echinoderms from Venezuela (Gift.)
From the Department of Agriculture, through Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Chief of the Biological Survey, fresh-water crabs and shrimps from Mexico (collected by Nelson and Goldman), yielding two new species. (Gift.)
From W. P, Hay, Washington, D. C., thirteen species of named isopods and amphipods. (Exchange. )
From F. 8. Conant, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., types of three species of chetognaths. (Gift.)
i Prof. S. E. Meek, Fayetteville, Ark., types of Camburus faxonii, Meek. (Gift. )

<<<Page: 98>>>

From P. H. Sérensen, Jakobshavn, North Greenland, miscellaneous invertebrates. (Gift. )
From H. F. Hughes, Harbor, Oreg., specimens of two undescribed species of hydroids. (Gift.)
From H. A. Lafler, Dewitt, Nebr., three accessions of fresh-water Crustacea. (Gift.)
From Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., three species of Brazilian crabs (Callinectes). (Exchange. )
From Samuel J. Holmes, Chicago, IU., three anomuran crustaceans. (Exchange.)
From Prof. A. Dugeés, Guanajuato, Mexico, eight specimens of crabs (Pseudothelphusa jouyi, Rathbun). (Gift.)
Material resulting from explorations, as will be noted from the above statement, embraced that received from the United States Fish Commission; from the Imperial Royal Natural History Museum, Vienna; from the Royal Biological Station, Helgoland, and from the United States Department of Agriculture.
A great deal of time is consumed by the scientific force of this department in the selection and preparation of collections sent out in exchange or as gifts. The composition of the sets of the regular series of duplicates has been set forth in previous reports. The last set of Series Iv was sent out during the year just closed, and seven sets of Series v were distributed. Twelve special sets were prepared, several of which were for exchange with foreign museums or individuals. In addition, nine collections of unassorted foraminiferous material were distributed.
A fine collection of miscellaneous invertebrates, including a number of commercial sponges, was lent to the United States Fish Commission for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. For the exhibit of the National Museum at the same Exposition a large and showy collection of invertebrates, consisting chiefly of dried specimens mounted on tablets, was prepared by Mr. Benedict, who was assisted in this work by Prof F. M. Comstock, of the Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio. The work of installing this exhibit at the Exposition and of repacking it for shipment to Washington occupied Mr. Benedict’s time for one month.
About 4,200 lots of specimens, consisting chiefly of mollusks, have been received from the Peabody Museum, New Haven, where the work of separating and classifying the material collected by the Fish Commission in past years has been continued by Professor Verrill.
The following statement regarding matters incident to the care of the collections is taken from the curator’s report:
The former ‘‘reptile room” in the west basement was reassigned to this department early in January. New and commodious shelving was erected in the middle of the room, and the extra accommodation afforded for alcoholics permitted a more systematic arrangement of the collections in storage in the basement. The groups are now arranged in the main as follows: The echini, starfishes, and holothurians are in the west room; the anthozoa and crinoids in the reptile room; the crusta-
ceans, bryozoans, ascidians, and ophiurans in the main basement room, and the sponges are arranged in exhibition cases.

<<<Page: 99>>>

In transposing the collections the small tower room leading from the gallery was abandoned, and also all the cases in the hall of the west basement. Se
The northwest tower, opening from the exhibition hall, was fitted with additional shelving, and certain collections of annelids and anomurans which were needed for study, and other material, has been stored there.
During the year the alcoholic collections have been examined, alcohol added to replace that lost by evaporation, and stoppers and rubbers renewed where necessary.
A new card catalogue has been started, with cards of the library bureau size. Labels printed on red paper are now used for jars and bottles containing type specimens, and a white label with the word ‘‘type” printed in large red capitals is placed inside the jar.
An exceedingly interesting addition to the exhibition series in this department consists of a type series of Foraminifera mounted for microscopic examination in such a manner as to make it readily accessible to the public. This series was prepared by Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S.N,, who has prepared for publication a description of the method of mounting and also of the specimens included in the series.
An article containing instructions for the preservation of specimens, and intended especially for collectors on board ship, was prepared for publication by the Fish Commission.
In addition to the paper already mentioned as having been published by Mr. Benedict, five others, based upon Museum material, have been published by various collaborators. Several new genera and some thirty-five new species are described in these papers.
The work already planned for the future includes the placing upon exhibition of one or more specimens of each species of invertebrates in the Museum collections whose bathymetrical range exceeds 1,000 feet; the preparation of an educational series embracing all of the principal groups of invertebrates, for distribution to high schools and academies, and the preparation of a complete card-catalogue of the types in the department, with reference to the original description, type locality, etc.
The number of specimens received during the year exceeded 4,800. The following statement shows the number of catalogue entries:

Several series of specimens have been added to this collection during the year, the most important being the one deposited by the Bureau of

<<<Page: 100>>>

Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture. The accessions include some very valuable specimens.
Owing to lack of space, it has been impossible to make much progress in the work of administering upon the collections, although new labels are being installed throughout. An effort is now being made to collect types and cotypes from Europe and America.
The work of the custodian, Dr. C. W. Stiles, has included a revision of the adult tapeworms of hares and rabbits.
Pending the entry and cataloguing of the specimens received from the Bureau of Animal Industry, no estimate can be given of the number of specimens in the collection. More than 1,400 entries have been made in the catalogue since the last report, making a total of 1,550 entries to June 30, 1896,
Several papers have been published by Dr. Stiles during the year, the titles of which will be found in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).
The accessions have been fewer than during the preceding year, although the material received is reported by the curator, Mr. F. A. Lueas, to possess considerable scientific value. A skeleton of Pontoporia blainvillei, for a long time a special desideratum, was received from the La Plata Museum in exchange.
Toward the close of the fiscal year it became necessary to remove all the cases from the exhibition hall, in order to lay a new floor. This effectually prevented, for the time being, any additions to or improvements in the exhibition series.
Regarding the actual work upon the collections, Mr. Lucas says:
Aside from the moving of specimens, necessitated by changes in the workroom, exhibition hall, and basement of stable where alcoholics are stored, little has been done, the greater part of the time of the preparator having been devoted to the preparation of specimens for the department of mammals and the Department of Agriculture, and work connected with the Atlanta Exposition. Copy has been prepared for many labels, and some additions have been made to the synoptic series of invertebrates. A number of additions have also been made to the exhibition series in the way of skeletons and models acquired for the Atlanta Exposition.
The study series is in good condition, except that the specimens are crowded. This is due in part to the fact that it has been necessary to assign considerable space to the Department of Agriculture deposit, necessitating the storage of some of the Museum material, and the transfer of nearly all of the cetaceans to the rooms occupied by the department of mammals.
Mr. Lucas has commenced a study of the changes in the skull of the cormorants, and has continued his studies of the tongues of birds and their modification and adaptation to various kinds of food and the manner of obtaining it. A study of the skull of the extinct Pallas Cormorant has been completed. Other investigations, which are being conducted by Mr. Lucas in connection with his work in vertebrate

<<<Page: 101>>>

paleontology, are referred to in the review of the department of paleontology.
Ten papers have been published during the year by the curator. He also completed and edited a posthumous paper of Dr. Joseph Leidy on “Fossil Vertebrates of the Alachua Clays of Florida.”
Among those who have cooperated with the department, Lieut. Wirt Robinson, United States Army, and Mr, A. W. Anthony, San Diego, California, should be mentioned, the former having contributed several species of humming-birds in alcohol, and the latter some specimens of petrels.
Referring to the further development of the department, Mr. Lucas submits the following plans:
It would be very desirable to fill up the gaps in the exhibition series of birds, reptiles, and fishes, to extend the tooth series and that showing the modifications of the dermis and epidermis, and to add to the synoptic series of invertebrates.
A few changes of irons and pedestals are needed among the mammals, and a large number of labels should be supplied where they are now lacking. Finally, the exhibition series needs much rearrangement, as also does the study series.
In regard to scientific work, the curator would like to complete the study of the development of the skull among the cormorants, and, if material can be obtained, to finish work on the osteology of the cormorants in relation to the origin and distribution of the group. It is hoped that the paper on the fossil bisons of North America may be completed and work begun on the Dinosaurs of the Potomac. | It is also desirable to continue the study of the swifts and of the modifications of the tongues of birds, while the paper on the Zeuglodon, undertaken in conjunction with Mr. True, should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.
About the middle of June, 1896, Mr. Lucas started for the Pribilof Islands as a member of a special commission appointed by the President to investigate the present condition of the fur-seal herds on the Pribilof, Commander, and Kurile islands.
The number of specimens added during the year is as follows: Fishes, 51; reptiles, 62; birds, 69; mammals, 17; models, 8; total, 207. There are now over 15,000 specimens in the collections. The last catalogue entries at the end of the year just closed and at the end of the preceding year are shown in the following table:

than that of the accessions in the preceding year. An increase is also noted in the number of accessions. A collection of vertebrates, made under the direction of Prof. O. C. Marsh, which has been on exhibition in the Museum for several years, was formally transferred from the United States Geological Survey. There were also received from the same source one hundred and fifteen boxes of unprepared vertebrate material from Kansas, a valuable collection of Green River fishes, a series of specimens studied by Professor Leidy and Mr. Lucas, a few fossil insects collected by Mr. David White, and an identified colleetion of Cephalopoda, studied by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Charles Schuchert, the assistant curator, collected for the Museum an extensive series of Devonian fossils, embracing about sixteen thousand specimens. These were obtained in New York, Ontario, and Michigan. Over two thousand six hundred specimens of Middle Cambrian fossils from Newfoundland and from St. Davids, Wales, were purchased from Mr. E. E. Howell, of this city. Another installment of fossil plants, together with a series of fossil fishes, was received from Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. A large and valuable collection of fossils from various horizons, collected by the late Dr. Daniel Breed, was transmitted through Prof. B. T. Janney, administrator of the estate. This material was received in part as a gift and in part as an exchange. Mr. George Kernahan, Thedford, Ontario, contributed an excellent collection of Middle Devonian fossils, embracing 442 specimens. A collection of teeth and bones of mammals, exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, was given to the Museum by the Peace River Phosphate Company of Florida. From Princeton College there were received in exchange skulls of Ischyromys typus, Leptauchenia major, and Eucrotaphus bullatus. From Dr. Herman Credner, Leipsic, Germany, fourteen specimens of Branchiosaurus amblystomus were obtained in exchange. In the same manner a collection of fossils and casts was secured from the Museo de la Plata, La Plata, Argentina; a large collection of Clinton and Niagara fossils, including many graptolites, from Col. Charles C. Grant, Hamilton, Ontario; thirty-six species of Russian Cretaceous fossils from Prof. A. Pavlow, Moscow, Russia; and a collection of characteristic Middle Devonian fossils from Mr. R. Macintosh, Thedford, Ontario. Four fine fossil meduse, from the Jurassic of Germany, were purchased from Dr. F. Krantz, Bonn, and other material worthy of mention was contributed as follows: Several collections of fossils from Galveston, Tex., from Mr. J. A. Singley; a collection of Lower Carboniferous fossils from Dr. J. H. Lemon, New Albany, Ind.; two collections of interesting fossils from the Choteau formation of Missouri, from Mr. R. A, Blair; and a series of characteristic Middle Devonian fossils from Mr. Maleom McKinnon, Thedford, Ontario.
The oe of ie magnificent Lacoe Se from Pittston, Pa., the residence of the donor, to Washington was completed during the

present fiscal year. The collection was formally offered to the Museum in December, 1891, and its extent and extraordinary scientific value were referred to at length in the report for the fiscal year ending June 30,1892. A brief statement of its contents may not, however, be out of place. The collection was included in three hundred and fifteen
boxes, as follows:
Two hundred and eight boxes, embracing over seventeen thousand specimens of Paleozoic plants. These include (1) types, and (2) specimens showing variation of species and geographic and geologic distribution. The contents of thirty-four of these boxes have not yet been determined.
Two boxes of Paleozoic plants.
Ninety boxes of duplicate Paleozoic plants.
Two boxes of Triassic fishes.
Two boxes of Paleozoic fishes.
One box of Paleozoic Crustacea.
Three boxes of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary plants.
Seven boxes, including eight hundred and four specimens of plants from the Dakota group, described in Monograph xvu, United States Geological Survey. One hundred and twenty-five of these specimens are types, and fifty-five were figured in the Monograph.
The motive of the donor in presenting this material, as stated by himself, was the belief that this disposition of it would best fulfill his purpose in the formation of the collection, which was to accumulate as complete a series as possible of the older fossil flora for use in paleontological research. No conditions were imposed which would in any way interfere with the proper use of the collection. It was desired, however, by the donor that it should be known as the ‘ Lacoe Collection,” and that it should be kept entire, with such additions as might be made to it in the future by further contributions from himself or by the exchange of duplicates. That the material should be made accessible to students generally is in accordance with the established rules of the Museum, and that every effort should be made for the proper preservation of so valuable a collection was a foregone conclusion. This collection represents the results of the scientific labors of Mr. Lacoe for twenty years or more. Not being satisfied, however, with the time which he could devote to the work in person, he employed collectors in various States and in the Canadian Provinces, and also expended large sums of money in the purchase of private collections. About seven hundred and fifty published types are embraced in that portion of the collection which has been described. The series illustrating the morphology of species and their geographical and geological distribution includes over seventeen thousand specimens. While the collection represents more thoroughly than any other in existence the fossil flora of the Pennsylvania anthracite regions, there are, in addition, good series from Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, and other States, as well as from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Brazil. Besides the plants from the Paleozoic formations, there are examples of the Cretaceous and Tertiary flora of Colorado, a series of Triassic and Paleozoic

<<<Page: 104>>>

fishes and Crustacea, and a collection of eight hundred and four plants from the Dakota group. <A portion of the latter was, as already mentioned, described by Professor Lesquereux, in Monograph xvi of the United States Geological Survey. Professor Lesquereux also studied the material from the Cretaceous and Tertiary of Colorado reterred to above, and the Triassic and Paleozoic fishes and Crustacea have been studied by Cope, Hall, Whitfield, and others.
Itis not too much to say that the National Museum has never received a giftof greater scientific valueor importance than that acquired through the generosity of Mr. Lacoe.
Interesting data concerning the number of published types of Paleozoic plants in the Lacoe collection, and in the other collections of the National Museum, are presented in the following tabulated statements:

The collections of this department are also to be enriched by Mr. I, H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, who has signified his intention of presenting to the National Museum his magnificent series of fossils. This collection is the result of the labors of Mr. Harris during the past fifty years, and is very rich in rare fossils, such as trilobites, crinoids, and starfishes. It includes also a fine collection of mollusca from the upper portion of the Cincinnati formation. Mr. Harris and Mr. Schuchert are engaged in the preparation of a monograph of American fossil starfishes, based upon this material.
The present condition of the paleontological collections and the progress made in caring for and installing the material are indicated in the following extract from the report of the assistant curator, Mr. Charles Schuchert:
Much of the time during July was devoted to preparing the Zeuglodon material gathered by the assistant curator last year. It was chiefly from this material that the restoration of Zeuglodon was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition. During

<<<Page: 105>>>

July and August a small series illustrating some of the characteristic plants and animals of the various geological horizons was selected, and the specimens mounted upon tiles in an attractive manner for exhibition at the Be Exposition. This collection received honorable mention.
From October 22 to about May 15 attention was given to the exhibit and study collections, but nothing could be done toward the contemplated mounting of the exhibition series in this department, excepting the Mesozoic and Tertiary plant collections, which are now practically finished. The time from May 15 to July 1 was devoted to mounting the ‘‘ Historical collection of fossils” in the department of geology. It was deemed best, before attempting the mounting on tiles of the general exhibition collection of fossils, to experiment upon a smaller collection. The first trial was that of the fossils exhibited at Atlanta, and a second and far larger test was made with the ‘‘ Historical collection” in the department of geology. It is now certain that the mounting of fossils upon tiles has decided advantages over paper, wood, slate, or ground-glass tablets. The only disadvantage observed is that tiles, because of the somewhat greater thickness necessary for their stability and flatness, are heavier than the other kind of tablets. This disadvantage, however, is not a fatal one. Considerable time during the year was given by Mr. David White, assisted by Messrs. Williard and Whipple, toward the further arrangement of the study series of the Lacoe collection. This work is not yet completed, and will not be until another case is built in the east room of the south tower. That portion of the Lacoe collection on exhibition remains in the same condition as last year. It is, however, hoped to complete, mount, and label this series during the next fiscal year.
While considerable time has been devoted to the invertebrate study series, much more work will have to be done before any intelligent selection can be made for the final exhibition series. The exhibit collection of vertebrates is in fair order, but more space is required to relieve it of its present congested condition. In the last annual report it was suggested that permanent cases be built along the north wall of the southeast court. Much vertebrate material is nearly ready for installation, and more will soon be at hand, for all of which additional space is necessary.
Eight hundred and eighty boxes of fossils are in storage, awaiting development and installation in the exhibition or study series.
The duplicate fossils are being removed from the study series as fast as possible, and laid aside for future exchange and distribution.
The Director of the United States anaes Survey has recently appointed Mr. H. E. Dickhaut, and the Museum, Mr. T. E. Williard, as preparators under the direction of the assistant curator. ee sil progress hereafter far more rapidly with the material in the Museum building, and it is hoped that some of the fossils now in storage will be removed during the year. However, the staff of this department has had in the past all it could do to arrange the collections as they came in from the field or from individuals.
Each summer various Geological Survey parties send in collections, and it is the custom for this department to assist in their preparation for study and in recording the material upon the Museum catalogues.
The Lacoe collection is not yet completely housed. This is due, in part, to the fact that the Museum has no paid officer directly in charge of fossil plants. However, Mr. David White has made considerable progress in this direction, and it is hoped, with the assistance of Mr. Williard, to complete the installation of the collection during 1896-97.
Considerable scientific work, based upon material in this department, has been accomplished during the year... The preparation of a
monograph on American fossil starfishes, by the assistant curator, Mr. Charles Schuchert, and Mr. I. H. Harris, has been referred to. Mr.

<<<Page: 106>>>

Schuchert has also completed a study of the American fossu Apodide, the manuscript of which has been turned over to the editor. The “Synopsis of American fossil Brachiopoda,” by the same author, referred to in the last Annual Report, was completed during the present year, and is now being revised. A short summary of this work has already appeared in Science. The titles of two or three other papers by Mr. Schuchert are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Mr. F. A. Lueas has begun a study of the character and affinities of the species of Zeuglodon, and a study of the species of the North American bison, with synopses of their salient characters, is well advanced. A posthumous paper of Dr. Joseph Leidy, edited by Mr. Lucas, has been published. It is entitled ‘Fossil Vertebrates from the Alachua Clays of Florida.” Mr. David White has made considerable progress with the description of new species in the Lacoe collection, regarding which Professor Lesquereux left some manuscript. Dr. R. R. Gurley has in preparation a revision of American Graptolites. This work will be published by the United States Geological Survey, but is based upon material which will become the property of the Museum. Mr. T. W. Stanton has published a work entitled ‘‘Contributions to the Cretaceous Paleontology of the Pacific Coast.” This is an illustrated work, and contains descriptions of about fifty new species and one new genus.
The explorations which have resulted in enriching the collections include those of Mr. Schuchert in New York, Ontario, and Michigan, already referred to indirectly in the statement regarding important accessions, and those made by the United States Geological Survey. Much of the material collected by the Survey during the present year has not yet been transferred to the Museum. It includes, however, a fine collection of Lower Silurian fossils from Valeour Island, Lake Champlain, and a collection of trilobites from Rome, N. Y. Although the Zeuglodon material collected by the assistant curator in 1894 was of great interest and value, no good skull and none of the bones of certain portions of the skeleton were secured. For this reason it is very desirable to continue these explorations with a view to securing the missing parts, if possible.
Material for study has been sent to ten specialists during the year. Dr. R. R. Gurley, Prof. Alpheus Hyatt, Cambridge, Mass., and Prof. H. F. Osborn, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, conducted investigations in the department. These matters are referred to more at length in the chapters entitled “Material Lent for Investigation” and “The Work of Students and Investigators at the Museum.”
A preparator of plants and invertebrate fossils has been employed during the year. It has not yet been possible, however, to appoint a preparator of vertebrate fossils, although the need for such an assistant is greatly felt. The necessity for additional cases to relieve the crowded

<<<Page: 107>>>

condition of the collections is also pressing, and is referred to in the report of the department as follows:
It is urgent that cases be provided at an early date to relieve the present congested condition of the vertebrate collections and to provide space for the rapidly accumulating material. There are two hundred and twenty-five boxes of vertebrate material now in storage, awaiting a preparator. The preparation of this material for study and exhibition will occupy all the time of one man no less than three years, and it is to be hoped that means will be available during 1896-97 to secure such a person.
* * * * * * oy
All the rooms now occupied by the various sections in the department of paleontology are crowded, and, while here and there small areas are available for additional cases of standard drawers, more exhibition space is required. This is especially so in the section of vertebrate fossils, since nearly all of the organisms are large and can best be housed in the exhibition series. Space for these collections can be secured if permanent cases are built around the walls of the southeast court and the standard cases now occupying that space be placed upon a gallery. Ifsucha gallery is built in the southeast court, ample exhibition and storage space will be at hand for the natural increase of the collections during the next few years.
Further drawer space is necessary to complete the housing of the Lacoe study collection. More than two-thirds of this collection is now stored in the two upper rooms of the south towers of the National Museum building. The west room is completely occupied with cases provided with standard drawers, while the east room is but half occupied. “f

The number of accessions for the year was two hundred and _ thirtysix, aS against six hundred and seventy for the preceding year. There was, however, no falling off in the number of specimens included, but, on the other hand, a slight increase. The question of scientific value is of greatest importance, however, and when the accumulations of the year are measured by this standard the results are very gratifying.
Among the important accessions were five lots of Mexican plants, purchased from Mr. E. W. Nelson, and aggregating two thousand four hundred specimens; five hundred and eleven specimens presented by the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta, India; fifty-eight specimens presented

by Baron Ferd. von Miiller, Melbourne, Australia; one hundred and thirty-five ferns presented by Hugo Fink, Cordova, Mexico; two hundred and thirty-eight specimens from the United States Fish Commission, and thirty specimens from C. F. Sonne, Truckee, Cal. Valuable material was received in exchange from the Royal Gardens, Kew, England, consisting of two hundred and fifty specimens of Umbelliferwe, and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger collected eighty specimens for the Museum in the Commander Islands.
Many important accessions were also received through the United States Department of Agriculture, including the following:

The space which can be devoted to the herbarium in the Museum is much too small for its proper accommodation. Means have been found, however, for providing a limited amount of additional space, and considerable progress has been made in caring for the collection, as will be seen by the following statement made by Mr. F. V. Coville, the honorary curator, It is especially gratifying to be able to report that the collection is in better condition than at any previous time,

<<<Page: 109>>>

One tower room, 12 by 10 feet, has been fitted up with shelves on four sides. This room is for storing unmounted material. One new balcony has been built, adjoining the main balcony on the south and running at right angles, covering a floor space 6 by 48.5 feet. This has been furnished with long shelves for the distribution of specimens; also an herbarium case extending along its entire length. The case contains eight hundred pigeon-holes, and will hold eighty thousand specimens. This has relieved somewhat the congested condition in the main balcony, although we shall soon need additional space if the present growth of the collection continues,
Much work has been done in readjusting, relabeling, and shifting of the packages of plants. While much remains yet to be done, all parts of the collection are readily accessible to the assistants and to visiting botanists. It is not improper to state here that the collection has never before been in such good condition.
The stamping of the herbarium, which was referred to in last year’s report, has extended from the Malvacex to the Anacardiacere. The number of specimens thus stamped is four thousand. It is very important that the whole collection be stamped as early as possible, but with our present force we are not able to make much progress.
The transportation to the main herbarium of the collection now stored in the south balcony has been continued, although little progress has been made owing to other duties. Six thousand specimens have been transferred. This work ought to be completed during the coming year.
The Department of Agriculture transferred to the Museum in March the collection of alge, lichens, hepatics, mosses, and ferns. The grasses, conifer, and parasitic fungi are still in charge of the Department of Agriculture.
The work of selecting and marking the type specimens in the herbarium has been continued. Thus far nine hundred species have been marked with a type label, indexed, placed in special sheets, and returned to the herbarium.
During the year thirty-six thousand specimens have been stamped and added to the permanent collection. This includes twenty-two thousand which have been mounted during the year and fourteen thousand which were not quite ready for distribution at the end of last year.
There is no exhibition series in this department. The need of still more space for the study series will soon become imperative.
Mr. J. N. Rose, one of the assistant curators, has published a report on Mexican Umbelliferze, mostly from the State of Oaxaca. ‘This paper contains descriptions of four new genera and twenty-seven new species. Mr. Rose has also published a number of shorter papers containing descriptions of new or rare species. During the year he determined the Polypetale of Mr. C. G. Pringle’s Mexican collection, continued work upon the collections made by Mr. E. W. Nelson and Dr. Edward Palmer in the same locality, and began a monograph on the Commelinacee of the United States. In the latter it is intended to include colored drawings of all the species.
Mr. Charles L. Pollard, assisted by other Washington botanists, has continued his revision of Professor Ward’s ‘‘Guide to the Flora of Washington and Vicinity.” It is hoped that the manuscript will be ready for the printer during the coming winter.
Mr. Coville states that no explorations have been made directly under the auspices of the Museum which resulted in additions to the collections in this department, although important material was obtained by Mr. I’. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger while they were in the service of the United States Fish Commission. Mr. W J McGee, of

<<<Page: 110>>>

the Bureau of American Ethnology, made a small collection in western Sonora, Mexico, and considerable material collected by Mr. J. B. Leiberg, a field agent of the Department of Agriculture, has been received.
Pleven persons have received material for examination or determination during the year, and six specialists, not members of the staff, have prosecuted investigations in the herbarium.
Among those who have rendered valuable service to the department, the following are mentioned by the curator:
Mr. E. G. Baker, of the British Museum, London, England, named and compared specimens with types in the British Museum.
Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, critically determined many Umbelliferie.
Mr. George E. Davenport, of Medford, Mass., critically determined Mexican and Alaskan ferns.
Mr. M. L. Fernald, of Cambridge, Mass., made many critical determinations.
Mr. J. M. Greenman, of Cambridge, Mass., rendered much assistance in determining Mr. Nelson’s large collection of Mexican plants.
Mr. George E. Osterhout, of New Windsor, Colo., sent some interesting plants from his State.
Mr. C. G. Pringle, of Charlotte, Vt., furnished many valuable notes and specimens of Mexican Umbellifere.
Mr. P. A. Rydberg, of Columbia College, New York City, lent specimens and determined critically a number of large genera, especially Physalis and Potentilla.
Prof. J. M. Coulter, of the University of Chicago, assisted in the determination of a number of new species of Umbellifere.
Mr. W. N. Suksdorf, of White Salmon, Wash., sent specimens of Umbellifere.
The material in the herbarium has served as the basis of thirty-seven papers, which have been published during the year by members of the staff and by other collaborators. The titles of these papers appear in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). They include descriptions of six new genera and sixty-seven new species and subspecies.
More than 17,000 specimens were received during the year, the catalogue entries numbering 236.
When the herbarium was transferred to the National Museum building in 1894, it was with the understanding that the force engaged in caring for the collection should be continued upon the rolls of the Department of Agriculture so long as the appropriations permitted it. The appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, was largely reduced, however, and the Department of Agriculture was obliged to decline to retain these employees on its rolls any longer. It then became necessary for the Museum to ask for an additional appropriation for the maintenance of the herbarium, and this has been provided for in the appropriations for the coming fiscal year. The matter was presented to the Committee on Appropriations by the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture and the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The letters to the committee urging the necessity of action are here presented:

<<<Page: 111>>>

APRIL 22, 1896. Hon. W. B. ALLISON, Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate.
DeEaR Sir: In response to your desire, communicated through Mr. Coville, for further information as to the purpose and effect of granting to the National Museum an additional sum of $10,000 for the maintenance of the National Herbarium, I have to reply as follows:
When, nearly two years ago, the Secretary of Agriculture found the Department buildings entirely too small, and it was brought to his attention that a large amount of space was occupied by a collection of plants estimated to be worth $250,000, and liable at any time to be destroyed by fire, arrangements were made with the Smithsonian Institution to house the collection in the fireproof building of the National Museum. The Department agreed to retain on its rolls, so long as the appropriation permitted it, the force of assistants necessary in caring for the ec Uection, but the unexpected reduction in the botanical appropriation, recently made, has forced the Secretary to ask that he be relieved of this charge.
If the proposed appropriation be made, the force of assistants and mounters now engaged in caring for the herbarium in the National Museum building will be transferred to the rolls of that institution, and the places thus made vacant upon the statutory roll in our division of botany will be filled by the transfer of employees now on the botanical lump sum. No new employees will be appointed as a result of the change, and the statutory position of assistant curator will be left vacant during the coming year, either to be abolished in the next agricultural appropriation bill or to be changed to assistant botanist.
Besides the emergency reasons just cited for the transfer of the herbarium, the Department holds that the care of the collection is properly the function of the Smithsonian Institution, but that it should always be open te the botanists of the Department for reference and consultation in any investigation in which they need it. The object, and the sole object, of the proposed change is to place the herbarium in good hands and in its legitimate place, so as to enable the Department to organize all the botanical work on a directly practical basis.
Respectfully, CuHas. W. DABNEY, Jr., Assistant Secretary.
N. b.—This letter is written in connection with that of the Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, dated April 22, 1896, addressed to the Hon. W. B. Allison, Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, which is our authority for the above statement with regard to the part to be performed by the National Museum and Smithsonian Institution.
APRIL 22, 1896. Hon. WILLIAM B. ALLISON,
Chairman Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate.
Sir: I deem it my duty to bring to your attention the fact that unless some special provision is made for its maintenance, the National Herbarium, recently transferred from the care of the Department of Agriculture to that of the Smithsonian Institution, will become comparatively useless.
This is one of the largest collections of American plants in the world, and one of the most important, embracing as it does the collections of all the Government surveys from the time of Fremont and Wilkes to the present day. It contains about two hundred and fifty thousand specimens, mostly American, and constitutes for American botany a consultative library of specimens of the very greatest importance. Init there are many types of American plants not to be found elsewhere, and it is constantly consulted, either personally or through correspondence, by all working botanists in America.

<<<Page: 112>>>

Although the Smithsonian Institution has always been responsible for the administration of this herbarium, it was for many years relieved of the care and expense of this work by the Department of Agriculture. In the fall of 1894, however, the present Secretary, finding himself unable to give it proper accommodation, and also thinking it might suffer destruction if kept longer in a building which is not fireproof, requested the Secretary of this Institution to resume its direct custody ; promising, however, that so long as funds should be available for the purpose in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, he would be responsible for its support and maintenance.
The value of the collection was so great that the Secretary did not feel at liberty to refuse to receive it, and it was at once transferred, although at a very great inconvenience, since our Museum building is so crowded that several of its departments were seriously discommoded by the change.
From that time until now the herbarium has been maintained from the appropriation of the Department of Agriculture; but the appropriation for botanical work has been so much decreased by the present Congress, that, as I am informed, this can no longer be done.
The Secretary of Agriculture has already addressed a letter to you, calling your attention to this fact, and suggesting that the sum of $10,000, which was withdrawn from his appropriation, be added to our appropriation, ‘‘for the preservation and increase of the collections in the National Museum,” in order to provide for the utilization of this great collection of plants.
I need scarcely say to you that the collection is of special importance tothe Department of Agriculture, and is necessarily in constant use by many of its staff.
Should this addition to our appropriations not be made, I do not see how it is possible to do more for the herbarium than simply to preserve it from destruction. It can not be kept in such shape that it will be conveniently available for reference; it can not be increased in order to keep pace with the growth of botanical knowledge and the necessities of American botanists and of the Department of Agriculture. Nothing can be done with the great amount of material which is already on hand, which requires special treatment for its preservation and utilization. It will also be impossible to carry on the system of exchange, long practiced, by which notenly the National Herbarium but all the herbariums of the country are constantly benefited.
Should the sum of $10,000 be provided, it would be utilized in the first place by the retention of the staff of skilled assistants, clerks, and preparators already engaged upon this work and now on the rolls of the Department of Agriculture. The direct charge of the herbarium would be, as now, in the hands of the Botanist of the Department of Agriculture, who, by permission of the Secretary of Agriculture, serves in this capacity without compensation, with the title of honorary curator in the National Museum. There are also two skilled assistants, one at $1,800 and one at $1,200, and it is desired to add another at $1,500 to take charge of the collection of cryptogamic plants. There is also a typewriter and clerk at $900, one preparator at $720 and three at $600, making in all $7,920.
Supplies and materials for preservation cost annually about $1,000, about $800 of this sum being required for the purchase of paper for mounting and covers.
A certain sum is required each year for the acquisition of new material, the types of new investigations, and the results of explorations of the year. For this a sum of about $750 is required. This would leave a contingent sum of $330.
Should the desired sum be granted, it will be possible to maintain this vast collection, which is of much importance to botanical science, in a manner befitting the dignity of the nation.
I am, sir, with great respect, G. Brown GOODE, Acting Secretary.

Special attention has been given to the work of securing material illustrating the associations, occurrence, and typical development of minerals of specific localities. This has indirectly been the cause of a great increase in the scientific value of the collections during the year. The report of the honorary curator, Prof. I’. W. Clarke, states that all the collections show a steady and highly gratifying growth. Three of the accessions comprised material deposited by the Smithsonian Institution for addition to the Lea collection. These included a collection of gems, semi-precious stones, and minerals from the southern states; a nugget of native silver, weighing 448 ounces, from Pinal County, Ariz., and a specimen of green tourmaline—a cut stone weighing 574 carats and valued at $1,500. This material was presented by Dr. lL. T. Chamberlain to the Smithsonian Institution, and by the latter deposited in the National Museum. It is another evidence of Dr. Chamberlain’s unstinted generosity by which the Museum has benefited so largely in the past.
Of the other accessions by gift the following are deemed worthy of special mention: A collection of minerals from the Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Ariz., presented by the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company, New York City; specimens of lawsonite from F. L. Ransome, through H. W. Turner, United States Geological Survey; a specimen of lorandite, a new species of mineral, from George L. English & Co., New York City; specimens of Georgia bauxite and associated minerals from the Georgia Bauxite and Mining Company, Linwood, Ga.; a specimen of caswellite, a new species of mineral, from Franklin, N. J., presented by Col. G. Cesar; a collection of minerals from Marion County, Ark., exhibited at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta; a collection of distorted selenite crystals and other minerals from Hants County, Nova Scotia, presented by Dr. M. C. Smith, Lynn, Mass., and specimens of quartz crystals, distorted and highly moditied, from Arkansas, presented by Charles F. Brown, Hot Springs, Ark. A large slab of agatized wood from Chalcedony Park, Arizona, was deposited by the Drake Company, St. Paul, Minn., and a specimen of thaumasite from a new American locality was purchased from George L. English & Co.
The time of the honorary curator is occupied to so great an extent in connection with his position as chief chemist of the United States Geological Survey that the care of the collections has devolved very largely upon the assistant curator, Mr. Wirt T'assin. The many minor details of installation, consisting of reblocking, mounting, developing crystals, etc., have been carried on continuously, with the result that a marked improvement in the appearance of the collections is noticeable.
An investigation of the minerals of Italian Peak, Colorado, is now in progress, while earlier in the year a large amount of time was spent in the study of comparative mineralogy.

<<<Page: 114>>>

Under the head of explorations mention is made in the curator’s report of the material secured by the field parties of the United States Geological Survey, and also of the collections obtained by the assistant curator in the zinc regions of New Jersey. A nearly complete set of the minerals of this region was secured.
Reference to the work of Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, of the United States Geological Survey, who prosecuted certain investigations in the department during the year, will be found in another place.
The honorary curator has published three papers during the period covered by this report.
Among the plans proposed for the future, special reference is made by the curator to the establishment of a series illustrating mineral technology.
Nearly 1,100 specimens were added to the collection. The last catalogue entry in June, 1895, was 83613, and in June, 1896, 83761.
The number of permanent accessions during the year was eightyeight, as against seventy-nine for the preceding year. There were also one hundred and sixty “temporary” accessions, consisting of material received for examination and report. This is an increase of thirty-eight over the preceding year. The value of the material received during the year covered by this report is considerably greater than of that received in 1894-95, owing to the character of the specimens obtained by purchase for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta.
Among the important accessions, the following are mentioned by the curator, Dr. George P. Merrill:
(1) Collection of gold and silver minerals, purchased for the Atlanta Exposition. Value, $600.
(2) Two slabs of serpentine marble from Westfield, Mass.; septaria nodules from England; alabaster from Tuscany, and obsidian from Lipari.
(3) A collection of nonmetallic minerals, rocks, ete., and five hundred and six thin sections of iron ores, collected during the work of the Tenth Census, but just turned over to the department by Prof. R. Pumpelly.
(4) One stalactite from the Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Ariz. (Purchase.)
(5) Amphora and other vessels of stalagmite from Egypt. (Purchase.)
(6) Collection of one hundred and sixteen specimens of gold and silver ores from North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, received from the United States Geological Survey.
(7) Collection of rocks and soils from Bermuda. (Gift of Dr. D. W. Prentiss. )
(8) Columnar sandstones from Zittau, Germany. (Gift of A. Kraus, United States consular agent.)
(9) Lithological collections, representing some five hundred specimens, collected in various parts of the United States. (From the United States Geological Survey.)
A portion of the material received during the year was collected by the curator personally.
Regarding the care of the collections, Dr. Merrill says that over six hundred printed labels for the exhibition series have been received from

<<<Page: 115>>>

the printer during the year, and that copy has been prepared for about five hundred more. The card catalogue of the exhibition series has been kept up to date, and a limited number of cubes of building stones have been cut. About two hundred thin sections were prepared, and over three thousand five hundred duplicate specimens identified, labeled, and laid aside for future use. It is proposed to sort out and prepare for distribution all the duplicate material in the storeroom, with a view to utilizing this space for the study series, the latter having outgrown its present accommodations. A large proportion of the exhibition cases in this department are floor uprights, and have no space for storage.
A number of the exhibits require rearranging, but this matter will be deferred until the question of erecting balconies shall have been decided. The exhibition series is fairly well labeled, although many typewritten labels are at present in use.
The investigations of the curator have consisted mainly of studies relating to rock weathering and to the composition, character, and origin of material belonging to the nonmetallic economic series. He has devoted special attention to asbestus, ochres, and soapstones. About fifty analyses have been made in connection with investigations relating to rock weathering and the formation of soils.
A considerable number of specimens, including many thin sections of rocks, have been lent to various persons for study, Reference to these transactions will be found in another place.
Among those whose cooperation has been of value during the present year the name of Mr. F. W. Crosby, of this city, should be mentioned. The department is also indebted to the United States Geological Survey for a large proportion of the most valuable material acquired.
Five papers have been published by Dr. Merrill during the year, three of which appeared in publications of the National Museum.
Regarding the future development of the department, the curator States that the quality of the material in the collections could in many instances be improved by substituting new specimens, but that desirable specimens can, as a rule, be obtained only by purchase or by the employment of a paid collector. Occasionally, however, such specimens are to be secured by exchange.
The present condition of the collections is indicated in the following Statement:
The catalogue entries show that one thousand one hundred and sixty-two specimens have been received during the year. This includes both exhibition and study material. It does not, however, include the five hundred and oda microscopic slides, which are never catalogued. Several of the entries are those of collections includ-
ing from one to several specimens each. Estimated number of specimens in the collection:

The last entry in the catalogue on June 30, 1895, was 62781, and on June 30, 1896, 63469.
The value of the accessions during the fiscal year just closed is not so great as during the previous year, owing to the fact that in 1894-95 a considerable quantity of material was obtained especially for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. Since the return of these exhibits the curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, has been occupied in installing such as could be placed upon exhibition, the remainder having been put in storage.
The most important accession of the year was from Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, consisting of more than one thousand five hundred specimens of antiquities from the Pueblo region. This is regarded as the most _ valuable material ever received by the National Museum from the southwest. An important collection of ethnological specimens was also sent in by Dr. W. L. Abbott. This material was obtained in the Vale of Kashmir. Dr. Washington Matthews, United States Army, presented « small but valuable collection of paints and dyes used by the Navajo Indians, and from the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy, through Prof. H. H. Giglioli, an interesting series of specimens was received in exchange. Among other accessions the following may be noticed: A collection from New Guinea, made by Dr. A. C. Haddon; a collection of objects designed to illustrate the cannibal ceremonies of the Fort Rupert Indians, made by Dr. Franz Boas; a series of two hundred and six specimens from the Lubny Museum, Poltava, Little Russia; and a small collection obtained by the United States Fish Commission in Alaska.
Upon the return of the coilections sent to the Atlanta Exposition, a radical change was necessitated both in the exhibition halls and in the storage rooms. In the chapter entitled ““‘The Development and Arrangement of the Exhibition Series” will be found a paragraph relating to the rearrangement of the halls. In the upper story of the north tower on the west side of the building are stored such objects as can not be arranged in cases or drawers, while in the third story the entire collection of Eskimo costumes, snowshoes, and objects connected with personal adornment and with travel are packed away. In the small room on the lower floor of this tower a large portion of the Dorsey Mohun African collection is stored, together with the collection of breech-loading firearms, the series of foods and medicines, and a number of other objects. The corresponding room in the south tower is filled with swinging screens and unit boxes. All manuscripts, catalogues, drawings, and photographs relatin g to the collections have been placed in the rooms in the second story of the south tower. The curator
States that the material not on exhibition is in better condition than ever before.

<<<Page: 117>>>

The ancient pottery, not including that from the Pueblo region, having been transferred to the department of prehistoric anthropology, the work of preparing, in the northwest court, an exhibit illustrating the life of the Pueblo tribes, has been continued. In this the curator has had the assistance of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing.
A great deal of time has been spent in preparing a catalogue of the material received by the department of ethnology during the last fifty years. The task has now been finished. Not every specimen has been catalogued separately, but, in the words of the curator, ‘every specimen that would seem to have any value in a comprehensive and comparative study.” The work of checking off on this catalogue the material sent out by the department, through exchanges with other museums, still remains to be done. <A large number of specimens have also been withdrawn from time to time for the purpose of establishing the various sections included under the department of arts and industries. These should be checked off in a similar manner, but in order to perform this task, additional clerical help is needed.
The preparation of a comprehensive work on the practical arts of the American Indians is at present occupying the attention of the curator. He has in view the work of establishing a series of types characterizing the arts practiced in various culture-regions. In this undertaking he is making use not only of the material in the National Museum, but is also utilizing trustworthy data obtained from other sources. A systematic plan has been laid out, and a large number of illustrations have been already prepared.
Under the head of Explorations, and in addition to the valuable material obtained by Dr. Fewkes in Arizona, which has already been referred to, reference should be made to a collection obtained by Mr. James Mooney, illustrating the various phases of life among the Kiowa Indians.
Only a small quantity of material has been sent out for study during the year. It is the effort of the department to induce investigators to conduct their studies in the building, where the student finds many things which would otherwise escape his observation. The curator also is frequently enabled by this method to obtain information from those who have prosecuted extensive investigations along certain lines. In another chapter reference is made to the researches of some of these students. A study of the Eskimo lamp has occupied the attention of the assistant curator, Dr. Walter Hough, for a considerable length of time.
The department has profited by the generous cooperation of many persons. Through the offices of Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State, a large number of specimens have been secured for the Museum, and among others who have rendered service in various ways Mr. W.S. Hill, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Tacoma, Wash. ;

<<<Page: 118>>>

Prof. F, W. Putnam, Cambridge, Mass.; Rev. H. C. Mabie, Boston, Mass., and Dr. Franz Boas, American Museum of N atural History, New York City, should be mentioned.
Four papers based upon Museum material have been published by the curator during the year, and one by the assistant curator. The titles of these are included in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Six lectures were delivered by Professor Mason at Columbian University on “Primitive arts in their relation to Sociology as illustrated by the collections in the United States National Museum.”
Regarding the plans of the curator for the further development of his department, the following paragraphs are quoted from his report:
The curator would respectfully make the following suggestions with regard to the development of the department of ethnology: First, that hereafter collections from the American continent should be made with especial reference to completing, as far as possible, illustrations in things of the technical life of all the principal tribes and families of America. * * * In order to understand the true life of the aboriginal tribes of the Western Hemisphere, this Museum ought to contain a typical specimen from each of them belonging to every one of the great domestic industries; for instance, there should be a model of every kind of house ever lived in by any large number of people on this continent. There ought to be in every one of these collections, in miniature, in picture, or in description, the prevailing and customary furniture of the kitchen, the dining room, the bed room, the living room, and the social gathering room or its equivalent, indoors or out of doors. There should be in picture, in miniature, or in actual specimens, every kind of costume worn by a large number of individuals in every one of these tribes. Of course, it would be impossible to represent, in such a collection, all the little eccentricities of dress among savage people, where great varieties prevail among individuals of the same family. After all, in every tribe there is a composite dress, a dress which would take in pretty much all the dress of the tribe, and of this typical dress there should be in this Museum one example from each tribe.
There should also be gathered the tools used by all those tribes for all sorts of purposes ; for pounding, cutting, boring, smoothing, and various other purposes of common use. The metric appliances of all the tribes should be here, and in sufficient numbers to set forth the characteristics of each tribe. There should be a comprehensive series relating to the great industries of their lives; quarrying, mining, fishing, hunting, planting and gleaning, the intermediary arts by which the substances gathered in the primary arts are transferred to the uses of life, and the final arts and activities by which these products of industry are turned into the channels of consumption or enjoyment. Also the apparatus by which substances are moved from place to place upon the backs of men or beasts, whether on land, on water, or on snow. ‘This, of course, would make an ideal collection, but instead of gathering in a desultory way duplicates of material already in hand, the curator is now in possession of information which enables him to say whether a specimen which it is possible to acquire will fill one of the gaps herein indicated, or will add one more to a collection already containing a superabundance of such material.
There were 1,556 entries made in the catalogues during the year, embracing 2,828 specimens.
The curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, states that the scientific value of the collections received during the past year compares favorably with

<<<Page: 119>>>

tne genera average of preceding years. He believes that a comparison which takes into account only the number of specimens acquired would be of little value, inasmuch as during the preceding year the extensive collection deposited by Dr. Roland Steiner was catalogued, besides several other large lots of material, which resulted altogether in making the year 1894-95 one of the most notable in the history of the department.
The accessions during the year covered by this report embrace another collection of archeological objects from Dr. Roland Steiner; a number of paleolithic implements, fragments of Roman pottery and of Samian ware, fourteen specimens of animal bones, and a skull of a victim of the plague of 1549, from the Horniman Museum, London (exchange); a collection of human skulls and bones from a burial cave near Duffield, Scott County, Va., received from Mr. A. L. Pridemore, Jonesville, Va.; a polished stone implement found near Olympia, Wash., from Mr. R. H. Hannah, of that city; a series of implements obtained from the gravels of the Thames and from the chalk plateau of Kent, England (purchase); a number of specimens from W. P. Damon, West Auburn, Me. (exchange); implements, ornaments, vessels, etc., presented by Mr. Newton H. Chittenden, Mill River, Berkshire County, Mass.; pottery and vessels from mounds in Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee, sent by Capt. J. R. Johnson, Pittsburg, Pa., in exchange; large chipped digging implements and other specimens of flint from Kentucky, presented by Mr. Paul Weir, Owensboro, Ky.; three bone whistles from an ancient grave on San Clemente Island, Cal., presented by Mr. J. Neale Plumb.
A coliection of more than eight hundred archzeological objects from Michigan and Alabama was lent to the department for study and examination by Mr. Percy IF. Matthews, Florence, Ala., and Mr. Warren K. Moorehead, Columbus, Ohio, sent a small number of specimens for the same purpose.
The following statement regarding the progress made in caring for the collections is quoted from the report of the curator:
Two additional storerooms have been fitted with shelves during the past year. One,
in the south tower, has been utilized for the reception of North American pottery, mostly fragmentary, but still useful for study and exchanges. The other, in the southwest tower, has been filled with pottery from Central and South America, consisting principally of entire vessels.
All the Mexican and part of the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican collections were placed on exhibition, necessitating a rearrangement of the cases already devoted to objects from these countries.
As many as possible of the entire vessels from mound explorations in the United States were also placed on exhibition, and the remainder stored on shelves in the rear of the long wall case at the east end of the hall, All this material was received from the Museum building.
In addition there were packed and sent to storage 71 boxes containing stone implements, fragments of pottery, human bones, etc. These were part of the collections received from the Bureau of Ethnology and were temporarily stored on the floor of the anthropological hall, The aisles and passageways are now entirely clear.

<<<Page: 120>>>

There is no separate study series in this department. The exhibition series is in as good a condition as at any previous time. <A series of transparencies, to be placed in the windows of the anthropological hall, is in course of preparation.
A paper on the Swastika sign, by the curator, was published in the Museum Report for 1894. The preparation of several other papers by Dr. Wilson has now been nearly completed. The titles of those published during the year, so far as they are based upon Museum material, are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). A number of lectures have also been delivered by the curator.
Mr. John W. Emmert, of Bristol, Tenn., a former employee of the Bureau of Ethnology, and Gen. A. L. Pridemore, of Jonesville, Va., conducted certain explorations, on a small scale, under the auspices of the Museum, and a considerable quantity of material was secured. The curator, also, spent a few days in July, 1895, in exploring caverns in Ross and Hocking counties, Ohio. The time devoted to this work was necessarily very limited, but the observations made show that the caves had never been occupied by man, or that all traces of such occupation have been destroyed or effaced.
Material for study and for the purpose of illustrating lectures has been sent to persons outside the Museum on several occasions during the year, and some of the members of the scientific staff of the Museum have also borrowed material for use in their investigations. Mr. J. D. McGuire, Ellicott City, Md., has studied specimens belonging to the department in connection with the preparation of a paper on prehistoric pipes.
In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned, twelve others are referred to as having cooperated with the department during the year.
The views of the curator with regard to the policy which he believes should be followed in the future are here given:
Within the last ten years the collection in this department has increased from 65,000 to 209,346 specimens. This material is all useful, not to say necessary, in aiding to perfect our knowledge of the origin, growth, and culture of prehistoric man. But to use it for this purpose requires not a change, but an enlargement of the plan heretofore pursued. It is proposed by this enlargement to classify the implements and objects as rigidly and in as much detail as possible. This classification or division should deal with the object, its form, material, and function, and extend to localities, narrowing them as much as possible. This scheme applied, for example, to the State of Pennsylvania, would divide the State into the localities of the Valley of the Delaware and Susquehanna on the east, and on the west the Allegheny and Monongahelarivers, following them and their branches to the head waters, if need be, independent of State lines, In this way it would be possible to compare the implements of these valleys in three different sections of the State and see what differences were manifested. It is hoped, also, that it would be possible to determine the differences in the industry or culture of these localities. The classification of material would probably enable us to assign the stones of which the various implements were made, to their respective quarries and localities. A comparison between the implements of the various localities thus divided would show the commerce, if it did not show the migration, between the various peoples who occupied these localities.

<<<Page: 121>>>

This scheme should be carried out with all the implements and extended to all localities, and they should be described correctly, fully, and in detail, each different kind having two illustrations, one the large and the other the small size, and one or the other of them should have an edge view as well as a side view. When this is done, we shall have a fairly accurate knowledge of the number and kind, with the various differences of form and material, of every implement in the Museum, from every locality.
This can be done only by personal inspection of each object, wherein the cases must be opened and the objects handled and counted as they are segregated and classified. This being accomplished, many of the specimens now encumbering the cases can be retired, and only the type or representative specimen of each class of implements be retained and displayed; the rest of them may be either boxed and stored, or may be made up into sets for exchange. The effect of this would be to reduce the number of objects on display, but, naturally, the best specimens would be chosen, and therefore the beauty and effectiveness of the display would be increased. The specimens should be properly figured and described, either in a guide-book or label, and each implement exhibited would be the representative of a certain number of other implements not in sight. Thus, they would stand as though the entire number were on display, and the gorging process now going on would be materially relieved.
We have, during the existence of the Museum, been preparing for this classification and enumeration by the acceptance of all kinds of implements in as great a number as was obtainable. No fault is found, or to be found, with the policy by which this great aggregation of the commoner implements was made. It was necessary for the purpose indicated; it is still necessary, and should be continued until the plan herein suggested shall have been carried out.
There were 5,826 specimens received during the year, the total number now in the department being 209,346. The last catalogue entry in June, 1895, was 172315, and in June, 1896, 173061.
Technological collections.—Although the number of accessions was not large, several very interesting series and single specimens were added during the year. A collection of models illustrating the various methods of land transportation, and incidentally the development of the wheel, was prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, and installed in the Museum after its return to Washington. This series embraces thirty-nine models, and includes also a number of lithographs and photographs of foreign and American vehicles. The electrical collection was enriched by the Western Union Telegraph Company, which deposited the original of the first instrument used to record a message transmitted to a distant point by means of electricity. Models illustrating two electrical wheels, made by Benjamin Franklin in 1748 and described in his autobiography, were constructed. Mr. Edward L. Morse deposited various decorations conferred by foreign sovereigns upon his father.
A fine specimen of balsa, used by the Seri Indians, was received from the Bureau of Ethnology, through Mr. W J McGee, who collected it in Socorro, Mexico. This specimen was added to the collection illustrative of naval architecture. Among the models of steamboats

<<<Page: 122>>>

prepared for the Atlanta Exposition and now installed in the Museum halls, is a series showing early experiments in steam navigation, including models of steamboats made by Fitch, Rumsey, Fulton, Stevens, and Ericsson. A complete model of the steamship Savannah was’ built under the supervision of Capt. J. W. Collins. In the cases containing these models are also exhibited important historical relies relating to the vessels themselves.
‘A valuable series of tanned skins of animals, collected in Panama by Mr. R. T. Hill, of the United States Geological Survey, was added to the collection of animal products.
Regarding the progress made in caring for the various coliections, the following is quoted from the report of the curator, Mr. J. KE. Watkins:
The collection of boats has been overhauled, and a number of models repaired. The full-sized boats—kaiaks, dug-outs, etc.—have been rearranged upon the ceiling of the hall to a height great enough to admit an additional amount of light.
Two new cases have been erected in the east hall, and in them the collection illustrating the electrical industries and the collection illustrating methods of land transportation, which was received at the close of the Atlanta Exposition, have been installed.
The textile collection, which has been scattered for a number of years, has been brought together with a view to revising it and reinstalling such portions as may be deemed advisable.
The collection of animal products was not put under the care of the curator until some weeks after the death of Mr. R. Edward Earll, which occurred in March last, and since that time it has not been possible to give very much attention to the collection.
The following statement shows the number of specimens received during the year, the number of catalogue entries made during the same period, and the total number of specimens in the collection:

The graphic arts collection—Owing to the absence of the curator, Mr.
5. R. Koehler, during a considerable portion of the preceding fiscal year, and also during the first half of the year covered by this report, comparatively little has been done toward the development of the

<<<Page: 123>>>

collection. The most interesting addition was a “photo-autocopyist” outfit, illustrating a method of printing from gelatinized parchment. Fifty-nine specimens were received during the year, most of these having been obtained by the curator during his recent trip to Europe. Highteen specimens of half-tone work in black and in colors were presented by Messrs. John Swain & Son, London. Mr. N.S. Amstutz, who during the preceding year presented a number of copies of photographs transmitted by means of electricity, has offered to donate some models of machinery used by himself. Regarding the condition of the collection the curator says:
The specimens on exhibition speak for themselves. ‘They present the best illustration of the technical development of the reproductive or multiplying arts to be found on exhibition anywhere, whether here or in Europe. It is not intended to imply, however, that the collection is complete. The division illustrating the various methods of drawing and painting is still very incomplete, although full of interest even in its present state. In the division illustrating the application of printing to the industrial arts, only a beginning has been made.
A ‘‘study series” hardly exists, the specimens in the storage cases being mostly of a kind similar to those on exhibition. The collection of patents might be made useful to students, or rather to seekers of information of a practical kind, but it has been almost abandoned, for the present at least, and under the prevailing condition of things it is inaccessible to the public.
The collection has now reached such a stage that, according to the curator, it is impossible to make satisfactory progress without the expenditure of considerable money in the purchase of specimens; and even if funds were available for this purpose, lack of room would seriously hamper the efforts of the curator.
Mr. Koehler refers to this matter in the following language:
The section of graphic arts has reached a point where it must rest, unless it is supplied more liberally with money. The ground to be covered is as well covered as the facilities so far furnished will permit. The collections need piecing out in many places, and it is very desirable, also, that some of the specimens now on exhibition should be replaced by better ones. But this can be done only by the aid of money.
The above applies more especially to the illustrations of the reproductive or multiplying arts. The development of the collection illustrating the methods of drawing and painting must be left to the future. To make it what it might be or ought to be, would cost altogether too much money to allow it to be thought of at present.
Whether it is worth while to continue the effort to illustrate the applications of painting in the industrial arts may remain an open question. With a proper expenditure of time and of money, much interesting material could probably be obtained for this department from manufacturers. But as there is no room to exhibit the specimens that might be thus obtained, it would be useless to make further eitorts in this direction, even if the money needed were available, until the erection of a new building will permit of an enlargement of the section of graphic arts.
After the reconstruction above outlined, of the division embracing the reproductive or multiplying arts, which is and will probably always remain the main division of the section, the preparation of a handbook will be in order. Several beginnings toward such a handbook have been made, but they had to be abandoned, as the collections were too incomplete and the changes in them too rapid to make it likely that a handbook fitting them would have permanent value.

<<<Page: 124>>>

The number of the last catalogue entry on June 30, 1895, was 5561, and on June 30, 1896, 5620, The total number of specimens now in the collection, not including duplicates, is 5,620.
The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.— The collection of oriental antiquities is under the honorary curatorship of Dr. Paul Haupt, while Dr. Cyrus Adler occupies the position of assistant curator and is also custodian of the collection of religious ceremonial objects. There were twenty-eight accessions during the year, this being more than three times the number for the preceding year. A collection of facsimiles of important codices of the Bible, historical editions, and manuscripts was acquired by purchase. Twelve manuscripts and editiens of the Bible were deposited by Dr. Adler and three by Dr. Goode. A series of Hittite casts was purchased; also a cast of a human-headed winged bull, and one of a lion.
A collection of musical instruments, coins, and gems referred to in the Bible has been formed from material transferred from other departments in the Museum.
A series of carved ivory plaques was obtained, in exchange, from Prof. H. H. Giglioli, director of the Royal Zoological Museum, Florence, Italy; and specimens of pottery from the Cotton Grotto at Jerusalem were presented by Dr. Adler. The accessions also included twenty-six photographs from Miss EK. R. Scidmore, Washington, D. C.; a Bible from Dr. S. M. Burnett; seven marble fragments of Greek mythological figures from Professor Jerichau, Washington, D. C.; and two Bibles from Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, of the United States National Museum. A model of a Babylonian temple tower was made in the Museum. °
An exhibit of biblical objects, comprising about two hundred and fifty specimens, was prepared for the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. This is described more in detail in a paper published in Part 0 of this volume, in which the results of recent discoveries and researches in the domain of biblical and oriental archeology are also discussed.
The various objects received during the year have been placed upon exhibition, and the present arrangement of the collection is set forth in the chapter on the ‘“ Development and Arrangement of the Exhibition Series.”
A study of Assyrian and Babylonian seals, based upon the collections in the Museum, has been begun by Dr. Adler, and two papers based upon Museum material have been published by him during the year.
It is proposed to rearrange the Jewish and Mohammedan collections and to rearrange, classify, and complete the installation of the collections illustrating the religions of Eastern Asia.
The total number of specimens now in the collection is 3,020, of which 300 were received during the year just closed. The last catalogue entry in June, 1895, was 154990, and in June, 1896, 155122.

of Gilolo, and a three-jointed trombone from Sumatra, obtained in exchange from Mr. M. F. Savage, New York City; a small bird-shaped earthenware whistle, presented by Hon. W. W. Rockhill, Assistant Secretary of State; and a musical instrument transmitted by Mr. E. O. Schuyler, New York City, in exchange.
There were 43 entries made in the catalogue during the year, embracing the same number of specimens. The entire number of instruments in the collection is now more than 1,300.
Materia medica.—Owing to the rearrangement of the collections in some of the exhibition halls and the temporary removal of the cases containing these exhibits, the materia medica collection was rendered unavailable for exhibition purposes during the greater part of the year. No special effort to increase the collection was made, therefore, by the honorary curator, Dr. J. M. Flint, U.S. N., and his efforts therefore have been largely directed to the care and preservation of the specimens already on hand, and the routine work of the office incident thereto.
This temporary diminution of active work in this section allowed the curator to devote some time to microscopic work, in which he has for many years been interested, and in this connection he paid special attention to identifying, mounting, and arranging for exhibition a series of Foraminifera for the department of marine invertebrates. A paper, by the curator, describing a large number of species of Foraminifera, is being prepared by Dr. Flint for publication by the Museum.
Coincident with his microscopical studies the curator has devised a plan for exhibiting microscopical objects not requiring the use of very high magnifying powers. The instruments used are shown in plates 1-4, and they are best described in Dr. Flint’s own words:
The following description and illustrations of apparatus for public exhibition of microscopic objects are presented as being pertinent to the subject of the installation of museum exhibits. The apparatus described is believed to be the first practically successful attempt to make a series of such objects available for examination by the public, without extravagant expense or extreme watchfulness.
The first appliance for this purpose, devised by the writer, was an accessory to the ordinary microscope stand. It consisted of a circular plate of pasteboard made to revolve upon a pivot attached to the stage, the plate carrying a series of objects mounted upon small disks or small squares of glass (Plate 1). This accessory was made in 1885, and described in the American Monthly Microscopical Journal for November of that year.
This arrangement was only suitable for class use under the immediate supervision of the instructor, For public use the principle of the rotary stage has been developed by enlarging the circular plate, inclosing it securely in a box with a glass top upon which the microscope is fastened, giving a rotary motion to the stage by means of a friction roller operated by a milled head on the outside of the box, and a to-and-fro movement effected by a rack and pinion controlled by another milled head in close proximity to the former. By a combination of the two movements any portion of the plate may be brought under the microscope, and any number of objects arranged thereon be brought into the field in succession. The objects being inclosed in the box are secure from injury; the movement of the microscope for focal adjustment is limited by stops so that the object can not be entirely lost to view; the eyepieces are screwed in so that they can not be stolen, and the instrument is practi

cally safe from everything but malicious mischief. Special mounts are required in order to increase the carrying capacity of the stage, and for transparent objects the stage must be perforated in order that the light may pass upward from the reflector below. The instrument now in use in the Museum (Plate 2) was made in the year 1890, has been modified in a few details since, and has successfully endured manipulation by thousands of inexpert hands—of children as well as adults—without injury, and this without attendant supervision of any kind.
For the purpose of exhibiting a series of preparations mounted in the usual way upon glass slips or ‘“‘slides,” an entirely different. form of apparatus has been devised (Plates 3 and 4). An indefinite number of slides—from 10 to 100—are attached to an endless band of linen by means of thin brass holders which allow the slides to be changed when desired. This linen band passes over two rollers mounted upon a light brass frame which occupies the place of the ‘‘stage” of an ordinary microscope. The loops-of the band hang free. One of the rollers has a projecting pivot with a milled head by means of which it may be rotated, and the two rollers are connected by a narrow belt at each end. As the rollers are made to revolve, the band carrying the slides passes horizontally under the microscope, resting meanwhile upon the two narrow belts and being kept at a definite distance from the objective of the microscope by two guides, which press upon the slides from above. The brass frame rests upon a grooved bed-plate which permits a lateral movement of the frame. This lateral motion is controlled by a screw operated by means of a second milled head in convenient proximity to the one giving the to-and-fro motion. As in the other instrument, the specimens and nearly all parts of the mechanism are inclosed in a box secured by a lock, the only exposed parts being the microscope and the two milled heads controlling the motion of the slides. The advantages of this form of apparatus are that the usual glass slide, 3 inches long by 1 inch wide, upon which microscopic objects are usually mounted, may be used, and especially that the focal] distance is not disturbed by differences in thickness of the glass slides. The only disadvantage is that the mechanism is somewhat more delicate and complicated than in the other instrument and requires some little protection from the thoughtless violence of curious children. Microscopes copied from the original here described have been in use for several years, and no irremediable difficulties have been found in the way of their perfectly successful operation.
It is safe to say, from present experience, that these methods of installation of microscopic exhibits promise to open a new and interesting field of observation and study to museum visitors.
Physical apparatus.—Mr. W. C. Winlock remains in charge of this section as honorary curator. During the year there were deposited in the Museum by the Smithsonian Institution twelve pieces of electrical apparatus supposed to have been used by Professor Henry in his laboratory work at the Institution; also sixteen photographs of early electrical apparatus. These photographs were made under the direetion of Miss Henry and were exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893. A number of pieces of apparatus were purchased by the Smithsonian Institution and deposited in the Museum, including a pocket dial with compass, five sand-glasses, a Japanese clock, an iron clock dial, a hexagonal clock with three dials, and an hourglass.

In Appendix vit will be found a statement showing the amount of the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the disbursements under said appropriations, and the disposition of the unexpended balances remaining on hand from the appropriations of previous years. These statements are taken from the report of the chief clerk, Mir; WV. Cox.
The routine work of the office, consisting of the preparation of financial statements, of orders for the purchase of supplies and for the performance of services, the approval and registration. of requisitions for supplies, the examination of vouchers, etc., has been carried on. More than 1,500 letters were prepared.
The preparation of a suitable subject index to the letters sent from this office since 1885 was also taken up during the year. Seventeen thousand pages have been indexed on slips and are now being arranged for revision, after which they will be transcribed on cards for permanent reference. A complete record, on index cards, of all legislative matters of interest to the Institution has also been kept.
The building at the corner of Third and B streets, S. W., used for workshops and storage for the Museum, did not prove satisfactory for the purpose required, and a large warehouse on Ninth street, about three squares south of the Museum, was leased instead.
Congress having made an appropriation of $800 for the better protection of the Smithsonian and Museum buildings from fire, four new hydrants. were placed in position during the year and a quantity of new hose purchased. The hydrants were put in under the supervision of the engineer department of the District of Columbia. As an additional safeguard, a number of fire extinguishers has been procured, and the watch force is drilled regularly in fire duty.
A granito floor was laid in the exhibition hall of the department of comparative anatomy, and a mosaic floor in the vestibule at the north entrance of the Museum building.
In connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta, Ga., there were issued a large number of orders for the purchase of material and for services. Nearly three hundred accounts were audited for payment, involving expenditures amounting to $24,246.73, and more than three hundred letters were written. All
claims on account of the Museum exhibit have been settled, with a 98

<<<Page: 137>>>

balance of $3.27 remaining from the allotment of $24,250 for the preparation, installation, maintenance, and return of the exhibit.
Mr. Cox assumed charge of the exhibit at Atlanta from November 9 to December 10, 1895, during the absence of Mr. R. E. Earll.
This division remains under the charge of Mr. Rh. I. Geare. The office force includes two stenographers, one accession clerk, four index and record clerks, one file clerk, one compiler and proof reader, two typewriters, and one messenger. The technical correspondence of the Museum has steadily increased each year, and in 1895-96 more than 12,000 letters and other official papers were prepared in this office. The formal acknowledgment of, and official correspondence connected with, accessions to the Museum collections forms a special feature. This division is also charged with the preparation and proof reading of the administrative portion of the Annual Report of the Museum and the proof reading and general editorial supervision of the papers in the Appendix. For several years also the distribution of all Museum publications has formed part of the work of this office. This entails a large amount of routine work, such as the preparation of labels, the revision of the mailing lists, ete. As arule, about 15,000 volumes and 40,000 separates are distributed each year to libraries and individuals on the regular mailing lists. In addition, 3,000 to 4,000 applications for special papers and volumes are received annually.
During the year were distributed the Report of the Museum for 1893, Volume xvi of Proceedings of the National Museum, the separate papers in Volume xvirl (No. 1033 to 1082, excepting three papers which were delayed), and the last paper (No. 1032) in Volume xvi. Advance Sheets of two papers containing descriptions of remarkable new genera and species of batrachians and crustaceans obtained by the United States Fish Commission from an artesian well at San Marcos, Tex., and a third, containing preliminary diagnoses of new mammals from the Mexican border of the United States, collected by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United States Army, of the International Boundary Commission, have been printed and distributed. These papers will appear in Volume XVII of Proceedings.
A supplemental edition of Part “F” of Bulletin No. 39, ‘Directions for Collecting and Preserving Insects,” by the late Prof. C. V. Riley, was received from the printer in September, and hardly a day passes in which several requests for it are not received; nearly 4,000 copies have been already distributed.
Circular No. 47 was issued during the year. The purpose of this pamphlet is to specify the conditions upon which the Museum will undertake the examination of mollusks sent for identification. The sending of material of this kind to the Museum has increased very greatly during recent years, and as in almost every instance its return

<<<Page: 138>>>

was expected, the curator of the department of mollusks found it very desirable to at least impose certain conditions upon persons desiring to obtain expert determinations from the Museum in this direction.
Special effort is now being directed to the work of revising the mailing lists.
The list of libraries is being carefully scrutinized with a view to utilizing the small editions to the best advantage. It is proposed to include libraries which have attained to the number of 10,000 volumes since the list was first prepared, as well as to insure the representation on the list of all towns which contain more than 10,000 inhabitants.
The registrar, Mr. 8S. C. Brown, states that there were received during the year 25,249 packages of all kinds, including material for addition to the collections, publications, and supplies.
There were 3,195 packages sent out, of which 637 contained specimens transmitted to educational institutions as gifts, or sent to individuals or institutions in exchange or for study. A few specimens returned to owners are also included in this number. The entries made on the incoming transportation record numbered 2,910 and on the outgoing transportation record 1,487, there being an increase of about 250 entries in the case of the former record and of more than 700 in the latter.
The number of accessions or ‘‘lots” of material received was 1,299, an increase of 76 over the record for the preceding year. There was also an increase of 75 in the “temporary” accessions, consisting of material received for identification, the total for the present year haying been 542. About 27,000 specimens of all kinds have been sent out as gifts or in exchange, and about 3,000 specimens have been lent for study.
Of the entire number of objects donated to educational establishments perhaps two-thirds consisted of fishes and marine invertebrates. The remainder was composed largely of geological specimens and casts of prehistoric implements.
Several special collections of fishes were prepared in the fall of 1895 from material received from the United States Fish Commission. These were transmitted to the following institutions: Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio; State Normal School, Mankato, Minn.; High School, Duluth, Minn.; Arkansas Industrial University, Fayetteville, Ark.; University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.; Iowa State University, Iowa City, Iowa; Indiana University, Bloomington, Ind.; Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass.; Leland Stanford Junior University, Stanford University, Cal.
A few months later eight special collections of fishes, prepared from specimens obtained by the United States Fish Commission in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, were sent to the following establish-

The storage record shows that 305 packages were placed in storage, while 145 were withdrawn. z
In Appendix Ix will be found a statement, arranged geographically, showing in detail to what individuals and institutions specimens have been sent during the year, either in exchange, as gifts, or for study.

In Appendix x a condensed statement is presented, showing in a general way the character of the work performed during the year by the mechanics and laborers, under the supervision of Mr. Henry Horan. The report of the latter also contains statements showing the amount of fuel, gas, and ice consumed, the cost of supplies purchased for the department of buildings and labor, and the many items of work performed in addition to those mentioned in the appendix.
Mr. William Palmer continues to fill the position of chief taxidermist. He reports that five mammals were mounted during the year, three of them being intended for exhibition at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. Thirty-seven mammals were cleaned for this exhibit, and several were placed upon new stands. The groups of Rocky Mountain sheep and goats were dismounted and packed for shipment to Atlanta.
In addition to the exposition work above mentioned, ten specimens were cleaned, poisoned, and placed upon new stands.

<<<Page: 141>>>

During the year ninety mammals were received and skinned. Of this number more than one-half came from the National Zoological Park, as will be seen from the following table:

In addition, thirty-seven specimens of mammals, birds, reptiles, ete., were received from the Zoological Park and transferred immediately to other departments in the Museum.
Many of the bodies of the mammals skinned were turned over to the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of Agriculture, for examination as to the cause of death, and for the purpose of ascertaining if they contained parasites. A few were sent to the Army Medical Museum, and others were retained by the department of comparative anatomy in the National Museum.
A large number of skins were received to be remade, mounted, ete. Some of these were dry, while others were fresh or salted.

Of the large amount of miscellaneous work performed during the year the following items may be mentioned: Sixteen seal skins and a number of other large skins were cleaned preparatory to mounting; an antelope and several smaller mammals were mounted, although not entirely finished; a large sea lion was skinned; more than one hundred mounted mammals were crated, with a view to placing them in storage, and a large model of the National Zoological Park was made.
Casts were made of the following objects: Nine Egyptian inscriptions, two gold ornaments for the new Congressional Library building, two lizards, and a stone tablet.
Mr. Joseph Palmer was engaged for nearly the entire year on work for other departments in the Museum and for the Atlanta Exposition.
Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned and renovated about 700 specimens in the exhibition series. Although this is a much smaller number than was attended to last year, the

<<<Page: 143>>>

decrease is readily explained by the fact that the birds now being cleaned are larger and require a greater amount of care and labor. Four birds were mounted, and several poorly mounted specimens were reduced to skins. Twenty-seven birds, received in the flesh, including two young ostriches, were skinned for the study series.
There were cleaned for the department of mammals during the year 607 skulls, and for the Department of Agriculture 539 skulls (many of them being of the larger mammals), making a total of 1,146. Thirtytwo other specimens were also cleaned, 29 of them having been received in the flesh. Eighteen specimens were mounted, exclusive of the work done for the exhibit at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. Reference was made last year to the preparation of a skeleton of Zeuglodon for this exhibit. This work was completed, and several other skeletons were prepared for the same purpose.
The synoptic series of invertebrates and the series of wax models showing the development, from the embryo, of the trout, frog, chicken, etc., were packed up and sent to Atlanta. This work required exceptional care, owing to the nature of the specimens. Considerable time was necessarily spent in repacking the material for return to Washington at the close of the Exposition, and in installing it in the Museum.
A summary of the osteological work is given in the following table:

This paper includes the description of mollusks and brachiopods dredged on the Archi-
benthal plateau about the Hawaiian Islands, |
as well as others obtained by the Albatross on the western coast of America. A large number of species hitherto unfigured are fully illustrated, and twenty-nine new species, four new subgenera, two new genera, and one new family are described. The types of all are in the Museum. Apart from descriptions of new forms the
most important feature of the paper is found |
in the anatomical data relating to the genera EBuciroa and Halicardia, Callocardia and Lyonsiella, the subgenus Spergo of the Pleurotomide, Ancistrolepis of the Bueccinide, and the brachiopod genus Frieleia. It is shown that in the genus Halicardia a peripedal septum is
formed by a thick outgrowth from the mantle | independent of the gills and siphonal septum; |
that in Huciroa and Callocardia the gills differ
in very important characters from those of |
their nearest relatives, and incidentally that |
the subdivision of the pelecypods into orders based on differences of the gills alone is unnatural and can not be maintained. organ, the opisthopodium, discovered many
years ago in Pholadomya, by Owen, is shown |
to exist also in Halicardia, and is suitably illustrated.

SHUFELDT, Roperr W.—Continued.
There is a widespread zoological myth entertained by the hunters and sportsmen of the United States, to the effect that male squirrels habitually castrate each other at the season of the rut. This myth finds its origin in the demand of the ignorant for some explanation to account for the disappearance of the testes in the Sciuridw after the breeding season is over. This brief article gives the true explanation of the physiology of these organs in the Rodentia.
— The mystery of eels.
Popular Science News, Xxx, No. 1, New York, Jan., 1896, pp. 2, 3.
The original title of this contribution read ‘“Bels and their Allies,’’ but without the author’s permission the editor changed it to the one here given, and under which the article appeared. It is needless to say there is no ‘mystery’ connected with eels.
.The article gives a great deal of general information on the natural history of this group of fishes, rendered in a popular style, and illustrated by a reduced copy of Anguilla rostrata, drawn by the author after Goode’s figure in his ‘Fishery Industries of the United States;’’ Several references are made to the publications of the National Museum.

The article is illustrated by drawings made by Dr. Shufeldt, one of the Mitre-Shell, Mitre episcopatlis, and six others showing the various characters of shells. In the course of the article occasion is taken to invite attention to the conchological collections of the U. 8. National Museum, and especially to the fine series of shells in the ex. hibition cases, prepared to show shell structure and shell growth.

A reference to an article with this title contributed to Science by Prof. Charles L. Edwards (in a former issue), pointing out to him that not all the species of Phrynosoma are oviparous, as he seems to believe; that P: douglassti, at least, is viviparous, as the author knew from his own personal observations and from specimens he had since placed in the U.S. National Museum, collected by himself in New Mexico.

An article inviting attention to the numerous uses frogs are put to, both in the biological laboratories and elsewhere. Between the lines, this is an address to the antivivisectionists, showing how indispensable it is to have the use of living animal forms wherewith to demonstrate biological truths, especially in medicine and physiology. A fine half-tone of Rana catesbiana, from a photograph of a living specimen, by the author, illustrates the contribution.

This is a description of Unios believed to be Triassic. These four forms exhibit a remarkable diversity in form, sculpture, hinge, and other characters, and indicate that the genus Unio had long been established at the time these species wereliving. Specimens from the type lot and casts from types are in the National Museum collection.

Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., x vu, No. 1068, May 19, 1896, pp. 295-343, pl. 1x.
This paper briefly reviews the history of the classification of the Naiades, and proposes a new one in part, based on all the characters, but more especially on those of the hinge and embryos. Those genera which have taxodont teeth or vestiges of them, and pass through a larval stage called ‘‘lasidium,” are placed in the family Mutelidz, while those having schizodont teeth or their vestiges, and which pass through a glochidium stage, are classified under the Unionide, and the families and genera are defined.
It is held that the Naiades are distributed in eight regions or provinces, viz: Ethiopian, Palearctic, Oriental, and Australian in the Old World; a part of the Palearctic region, the Mississippi, Atlantic, Central American, and Neotropicai provinces in the New World.

On the Mississippi Valley Unionidie found in the St. Lawrence and Atlantic drainage areas.
Am. Naturalist, xxx, No. 353, May 20, 1896, pp. 379-384.
This paper shows that the extralimital Mississippi Valley Unionid found in the St. Lawrence Basin are usually dwarfed and dull colored, and the claim is made that many of the so-called species of the latter region are merely depauperate varieties of well-known Mississippi Valley forms which have become changed since they have occupied the waters they now inhabit. The theory is advanced that these species migrated northward at the close of the glacial epoch, by way of old streams that flowed from lakes in the north into the Mississippi Valley at that time, as the ice cap to the north and northeast prevented drainage to the north and east.

WILSON, Tiomas—Continued.
the Exposicion Historico-Americana by about 5,000 objects, selected from the collections, anc intended to present a synopsis of aboriginal industry. The objects were exhibited in nineteen double slope-top cases, which were distributed throughout the main hall assigned to the United States. They were classified, so far as possible, in such a way as to show a series of implements and objects in each case or in each portion of acase. General labels descriptive of the series were printed in Spanish and distributed in their appropriate places. A description of the objects displayed, together with the names assigned to them. the material used, the mode of manufacture, and probable purpose, are set forth in the catalogue.
— Age of the Indian race; proofs of the
antiquity of the red man in America.
The Sun, New York, Apr. 12, 1896.
The original colony must have been restricted in number and locality. It grew in numbers and spread to other localities, until the Indian population increased to millions, and covered the two continents. This required a long period of time. The original colony must have had but one language, but by extension and separation it acquired new ones, until the number amounted to nearly two hundred.

The following is an abstract of the report of the superintendent of buildings, Mr. Henry Horan, so far as it relates to the work of the mechanies and laborers.
July.—Repairs were made in the south tower and in other portions of the Smithsonian building. Several crates of cases were brought from storage and packed for shipment to the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta. Exhibits from the departments of minerals and paleontology were shipped to the Exposition during the month. In the room adjoining the dynamo room the floor was lowered and a large brick column removed.
August.—The cases containing material for the Atlanta Exposition were placed in the storage sheds south of the Smithsonian building as soon as packed, to await shipment, and later 117 boxes and crates were forwarded. A number of push buttons, connected with the annunciator in the telephone room, were placed at different points in the Museum building. The collection of the section of physical apparatus was removed from the cases on the first floor of the south tower of the Smithsonian building, and a portion of the instruments placed on exhibition in the east hall of the Museum. Workmen were engaged for several days in taking the boats from the ceiling in the hall where they are exhibited, measuring them, and returning them to their former positions.
September.—The work of shipping exhibits to the Atlanta Exposition was completed early in the month. The lecture hall was thoroughly cleaned, new matting laid, etc. The sheds in the rear of the Smithsonian Institution were painted. New book-cases were made and placed in the office of the Assistant Secretary. In many places the worn-out floors of the Museum were taken up and replaced with new material. All the large cases were moved from the rotunda, and small ones containing models of cliff-dwellings placed therein. Several new fire-plugs were placed in the grounds near the buildings. A chimney-flue was constructed from the second floor to the roof of the northwest pavilion.
October.—The floors in the offices of the Assistant Secretary and chief clerk were planed and cleaned. Wires were run to connect a signal bell in the department of materia medica with the telephone room, and the wires running from the Museum to the Department of Agriculture were overhauled. The top of the old well south of the Smithsonian Institution was arched over with brick. A new telephone instrument was put up in the office of the superintendent. The doorway leading from the vestibule to the stairway on the first floor of the northwest pavilion was altered, the opening being enlarged to a wide archway. Steam pipes were run from the boilers in the Smithsonian building to the east end of the shed just outside. The telephone wires were disconnected from the overhead cable and connected to the underground cable. The vestibule of the northwest entrance was wainscoated.
November.—Two radiators were placed in one of the sheds, and the pipe coils altered and improved. Water pipes were also placed in the same shed and a sink constructed. The lecture hall was put in readiness for the meeting of the American Ornithologists’ Union. A radiator was placed in one of the rooms adjoining

<<<Page: 312>>>

the east balcony. A workroom was fitted up for the plumber and pipe fitter. Incandescent electric lamps were put up in the coal vault and other cellars of the Museum. The work of painting the outside of the Museum building was commenced.
December.—Incandescent electric lamps were put up in the library. All the locks on the doors in the Museum were put in order, keys refitted, new ones made where necessary, and the records revised to correspond with the alterations and additions. The exhibition cases in the mineral hall were rearranged and four additional cases placed therein. The work of painting the outside of the Museum was continued; the walls in the east hall were also painted. The exhibition cases in the fisheries hall were rearranged. Two iron hitching-posts were placed at the east entrance of the Museum. A platform for the exhibition of certain large specimens was constructed in the east hall, and a heavy base for the serpent column of Delphi was made and set up.
1896.
January.—The lecture hall was put in order for the meeting of the National Science Club. An excavation was made in the basement of the Smithsonian building, and the space thus obtained, after having the floor and sides bricked up, was used for the reception of a small heating boiler. Six fire extinguishers were placed in different parts of the Museum building. Some additional cases were set up in the north hall. The fisheries hall was screened off for the reception of the exhibits returned from the Atlanta Exposition. The erection of a small gallery, to be used for storage cases for the herbarium, was commenced. |
February.—Much time was spent during this month in receiving, making space for, unpacking, and setting up in their proper departments the exhibits returned from the Atlanta Exposition. The three cases containing the Copp collection of New England historical and domestic objects were removed from the north hall to the lecture hall, to be photographed. The work of putting up the gallery for the herbarium was completed, and work commenced on the cases to be placed thereon. A large group belonging to the department of ethnology was installed in a case and placed in the rotunda of the Museum. The skeleton of Zeuglodon was hung from the ceiling of the southeast court. Inthe departments of minerals and comparative anatomy workmen were engaged in putting down concrete bases upon which to erect wall cases.
March.—In addition to the large amount of work required of the laborers in connection with the arrangement and installation of the material returned from the Atlanta Exposition, much other work was performed. The old Mexican cart was suspended from the ceiling of the east hall, and the platform on which it formerly rested wasremoved. All the material from the Third-street annex was transferred to the new storage house on Ninth street. The model of the locomotive exhibited on the platform over one of the windows in the east hall was taken down, and the platform removed. The Siamese cart was suspended from the ceiling, opposite the Mexican cart. Ail the material stored in the lecture hall was removed, and the hall cleaned and putin complete order for the regular course of Saturday afternoon lectures. Several of the pier screens in the mineral hall were lowered to conform with the others. Wires were placed under the floor of the lecture hall, from the desk to the stand used by the lantern operator.
April.—Material from the osteological and other work rooms was removed to the Ninth street annex. The plaster casts of the winged bull and lion were placed in position at the entrance to the east hall, and two large wooden idols were taken off their bases and placed on the balconies west of the rotunda. The three large railroad maps which were mounted on the south wall of the east hall were taken down and placed on the front of east balcony. All the cases were removed from

<<<Page: 313>>>

the rotunda. In anticipation of the meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, the lecture hall was cleaned. The work of taking down and remounting the cases in the east-south range, preparatory to laying an artificial stone floor, was commenced. The exhibition cases in the boat hall were removed to the fisheries hall to make room for the rearrangement of the boats on the walls and ceiling. The work of constructing new mahogany wall cases in the east hall was completed and the cases painted. The large arch screen at the east entrance to the Museum was altered.
May.—One of the large wall screens in the east hall was strengthened, with a view to mounting the Hittite casts thereon. A large Indian war canoe was suspended from the ceiling of the boat hall. Painters commenced work on the storage sheds at the armory. The models of the locomotives ‘‘Arabian” and ‘‘Tom Thumb” were mounted on floor cases in the east hall.
June.—The idols from Easter Island were moved from the vestibule and placed outside the north entrance tothe Museum. The storm doors at the north entrance were removed, certain woodwork cut away, and the top step reset. The old floor inside the north entrance was taken up, and other preliminary matters attended to preparatory to commencing work on the proposed improvements in the vestibule. A section of gallery was put up in the hall of geology and a case placed thereon, to test the appearance and effect of the galleries under contemplation. The seats along the wall of north hall were cleaned and oiled.
In addition to the work of the mechanics, already mentioned, there were constructed in the shops of the Museum 38 moth-proof quarterunit cases, 8 pine quarter-unit cases, 2 special unit cases, 2 oak and 3 pine book-cases, 3 pine catalogue-cases, 1 pine shelf-case, 5 pine storage-cases, 3 cases of drawers, 4 pine cases for lay figures, 1 pine ease for holding papers, 3 cupboards, 2 closets, 192 unit drawers, 2 case drawers, 4 pier-screens, 2 floor-screens and 2 arch-screens, 4 stepladders and 2 tables, besides many other articles.
The following is a partial list of cases, furniture, fittings, ete., repaired and altered: Six book-cases, 1 card catalogue-case, 1 key case, 9 pine bases, 5 oak bases, 12 unit boxes, 3 exhibition cases, 2 storage eases, 35 chairs, 4 case doors, 22 other doors, 462 unit drawers, 4 case drawers, 1,000 label-holders, 9 window sash, 20 floor, arch, and window screens, 60 shelves for cases, and 2 tables.
Other incidental work included the following items: Cases painted, 10; fire buckets lettered, 29; fire buckets lined with tin, 21; exhibition blocks made, 5,525; exhibition blocks painted, 5,469; exhibition blocks ebonized, 74; unit boxes painted, 14; unit boxes mounted on screens, 69; unit boxes fitted to cases, 140; door-screen cases, ete., painted, 18; doors painted, 9; unit drawers fitted to cases, 462; doors of cases, ete., glazed, 59; locks put on cases, ete., 80; case shelves painted, 107; storage-shelf racks put up, 15; sheds put up, 1; sheds painted, 3; transparencies lettered, 52; transparencies mounted, 31; ventilators put on windows, 12.
A large amount of work has been accomplished under the direction of the engineer. The covering of the steam pipes in the trenches has been removed and replaced with new material. The pipe dies used by the steam fitter have received attention, and are now in perfect

condition. The height of the exhaust pipe of the gas engine in the Museum carpenter shop was increased, in order to carry the exhaust above the windows in the main building. A number of electric lights were installed, as indicated above, and several changes were made in the location of steam radiators. The time and watch clocks received careful attention, and have given good results during the year. The furnaces were repaired, and new grate bars provided. Automatic oil feeders were placed upon the pumps. The boiler rooms and vaults of both buildings were painted and whitewashed.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE.
Among the powers conferred on Congress by the Constitution is authority “to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.”” A result of this provision was the establishment of the Patent Office and the assembling in connection therewith of numerous models of inventions.
A building for the Patent Office was erected in 1812, but it was destroyed by fire in 1836, and with it the models and records it contained.
“In the Patent Office building and with it destroyed,” writes Dr. Goode,’ ‘there was gathered a collection of models which was sometimes by courtesy called the ‘American Museum of Arts,’ and which afforded a precedent for the larger collection of models and natural products, which remained under the custody of the Commissioner of Patents until 1858, when it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution and became a part of the present National Museum.”
Though an assemblage of objects of more or less scientific interest was thus early formed as an indirect result of the policy pursued by the Government, the establishment of a national museum was earlier in the minds of many American statesmen, especially in connection with the educational institutes which it was thought the Government should found for the intellectual advancement of the people.
In the plan for a Federal university published in the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1788, and commonly credited to Madison,‘ section 8 relates to natural history, and in connection therewith the remark is made:
To render instruction in these branches of science easy, it will be necessary to
establish a museum, and also a garden, in which not only all the shrubs, ete., but all the forest trees of the United States should be cultivated.

The plan for a “National Institution” put forth by Joel Barlow in 1806 includes mention of the natural history and art museums of lrance in the preamble, and in the plan itself (though ambiguously worded) are provisions for collections of minerals and philosophical instruments.
While these and other similar plans show that the formation of national collections of art and science was thought desirable by the fathers, they did not result directly in the establishment of museums under the Government. The first really scientific collection that came into the possession of the Government was probably, as Dr. Goode has remarked,! Smithson’s cabinet of minerals, which was delivered, with the remainder of the Smithson estate, into the hands of Richard Rush, the agent of the United States, in 1838. The collection is described by a committee of the National Institute as follows:
Among tke effects of the late Mr. Smithson is a cabinet which, so far as it has been examined, proves to consist of a choice and beautiful collection of minerals, comprising probably eight or ten thousand specimens. The specimens, though generally small, are extremely perfect, and constitute a very complete geological and mineralogical series, embracing the finest varieties of crystallization, rendered more valuable by accompanying figures and descriptions by Mr. Smithson, and in his own writing. The cabinet also contains a valuable suite of meteoric stones, which appear to be suites of most of the important meteorites which have fallen in Europe during several centuries.
Three years later, in 1841, there was formed in Washington, chietly through the exertions of Hon. Joel R. Poinsett, of South Carolina, a scientific organization under the name of the National Institute with the avowed purpose of assembling scientific collections. Article 14 of the bill of incorporation reads thus:
The resident and corresponding members shall exert themselves to procure specimens of natural history, and so forth; and the said specimens shall be placed in the cabinet, under the superintendence of a board of curators, to be appointed by the directors. All such specimens, and so forth, unless deposited specially, shall remain in the cabinet; and, in case of the dissolution of the institution, shall become the property of the United States.”
The Institute was dissolved in 1861 and its collections deposited in the Smithsonian Institution. ‘By this society,” remarks Dr. Goode, “the nucleus for a national museum was gathered in the Patent Office Building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the Government of the United States.” ®

took under its care were those of the United States Exploring Expedition which was sent out by the Navy Department, under Lieutenant Wilkes, in 1838. Harlier expeditions under the auspices of the Government had been organized, but they either made no collections or deposited such as they did make in private museums outside of Washington.
The first collections of the exploring expedition were received in Philadelphia in 1840 and were temporarily stored in a room belonging to the Philadelphia Museum. Poinsett induced the Secretary of the Navy, James K. Paulding, to forward these collections to Washington, and interested himself to secure from Congress an appropriation of $5,000 to defray the cost of their transportation and subsequent arrangement.
In April, 1841, the collections were deposited in a portion of a room in the new Patent Office, designated for the purpose by the Secretary of State. Dr. Henry King, a geologist and mining expert and curator of the National Institute, was in direct charge. The compensation of the curator was paid from the appropriation of Congress already referred to.
With what rapidity collections accumulated under the charge of the National Institute may be learned from the report of the committee of the Institute dated January 1, 1842. This report recites that ‘the entire collection is deposited in the upper rooms of the Patent Office; it consists of:!
Donations from foreign governments.
Donations from other institutions, foreign and domestic.
Donations from ministers and consuls abroad, and fr. m officers of our Army and Navy.
Donations from individuals and from members of the Institution. The Iowa collection of mineralogical and geological specimens, made by R. D. Owen, esq., under the direction of the Treasury Department.
The collection of mineralogical and geological specimens which had been on deposit in the bureau of the Corps of Topographical Engineers.
The collection of portraits of distinguished Indians, and the collection of Indian curiosities which had been on deposit in the War Department.
The minerals, books, papers, and personal effects of the Smithsonian bequest.
The two shipments which have been received from the exploring squadron, consisting of minerals, specimens of natural history, works of art, implements of war, and curiosities.
The books, minerals, and works of art belonging to the late Columbian Institute.
The books, papers, and proceedings of the late American Historical Society.
Cabinets and specimens, deposited by members in trust, for public use.
These collections, according to the same report, comprised about 1,000 books and pamphlets, 50 maps and charts, 500 castings in plaster, medals and seals, 186 paintings, about 1,600 birds’ skins, 160 skins of quadrupeds, 50 skins of fishes; 200 jars, 2 barrels, and 10 kegs of fishes, reptiles, ete., in spirits; 50,000 botanical specimens, 3,000 insects,
‘Goode. ‘Genesis of the United States National Museum,” page 347.

<<<Page: 322>>>

several hundred thousand shells, 500 corallines, more than 2,000 crustaceans, 300 starfishes, etc., 100 sponges, 7,000 separate specimens of minerals, and 50 boxes of the minerals and geological specimens. Those engaged in caring for the collections at this time were the curator of the Institute, Dr. King, a taxidermist, a botanical assistant and two other assistants, a mechanic, and a laborer.
Thus was established what in reality was a national museum, containing collections belonging to the Government, sustained by an appropriation from Congress, and employing a curator and assistants. For a time prosperity seemed assured, but complications soon arose which proved disastrous in the highest degree not only to the Museum but to the National Institute itself.
The room in the Patent Office set apart for the collections by direction of the Secretary of State was needed for the display of models of inventions, and the Commissioner of Patents made strong protests against its occupancy by the Institute.
In August, 1842, Congress authorized the occupancy, ‘until other provisions be made by law,” and also appropriated $20,000 for the care . and arrangement of the collections, but in addition ordered that the persons having the work in charge should be appointed by the Joint Committee on the Library.
Only a month earlier a charter had been granted to the Institute, in which all trusts previously held were confirmed. *‘The supporters of the Institute,” writes Dr. Goode,' “‘ were disposed to urge that this was applicable to the collections of the ‘exploring squadron’ at that time in the custody of the Institute. The question did not come up in a troublesome way at this time, for the Library Committee, at that time {not| unfriendly, simply confirmed the choice of curator made by the National Institute, and appointed Dr. Pickering to the position, Dr. Pickering being thenceforth subject to the Congressional committee, and only by courtesy acting for the National Institute.”
A little later, in 1843, the Library Committee, having no longer any consideration for the Institute, without consulting its officers, appointed the Commissioner of Patents to have general charge of the Government collections, and Captain Wilkes, the head of the exploring expedition, to arrange and display them. Captain Wilkes proceeded with the work, pushing aside the collections of the Institute to make place for those of the Government, yet professing an interest in the welfare of the Institute and the security of its property. The drift of matters came to the attention of the officers of the Institute only by rumor, but Col. J. J. Abert initiated a correspondence with Captain Wilkes, inquiring whether he or his assistants would devote any time to the care of the collections of the Institute, and stating that if such was not the case the attention of the Institute would be immediately called to the necessity of otherwise protecting its property. The replies were not satisfactory. Captain Wilkes held that as he and his
1Goode. ‘Genesis of the United States National Museum,” page 311.

<<<Page: 323>>>

assistants were paid by the Government they could not spend any time in working upon collections belonging to a private organization. Nevertheless, he expressed an intention not to disturb the coilections of the Institute more than should be really necessary in working out those of the Government, and to watch over them as far as possible.
A few months later, in a correspondence relative to the ‘‘ Ontonagon” copper bowlder now in the National Museum, the Commissioner of Patents took the same ground, and held also that he had entire control over the room in which the property of the Institute was deposited.
At the end of 1843, therefore, the National Institute found itself bereft of the control of the Government collections, without funds, except the membership dues, which were much in arrears, and without quarters for its large and rapidly accumulating collections.
“The real cause of the decline of the National Institute,” writes Dr. Goode,! “was simple enough. Failing to secure grants of money from Congress, the society was overwhelmed by the deluge of museum materials, which in response to its enthusiastic and widely circulated appeals came to it from all quarters of the world. The annual receipts from the assessment of members were insufficient to pay for the care of the collections, and although by virtue of the long term of its charter the collections were kept together until 1861, there was little science and little energy manifested in this administration.” :
While the events we have mentioned were taking place extended discussions were going on in Congress, and in the country generally, regarding the proper disposition to be made of the bequest of James Smithson. It is unnecessary in the present connection to consider the various views put forth, further than to remark that several schemes included provisions for museums of natural history and the arts.
The act of incorporation of the Smithsonian Institution, passed August 10, 1846, provided that the Regents, having selected a proper site, ‘‘shall cause to be erected a suitable building, of plain and durable materials and structure, without unnecessary ornament, and of sufficient size, and with suitable rooms or halls for the reception and arrangement, upon a liberal scale, of objects of natural history, ineluding a geological and mineralogical cabinet; also, a chemical laboratory, a library, a gallery of art, and the necessary lecture rooms.”
It is further provided that the Regents ‘‘may so locate said building, if they shall deem it proper, as in appearance to form a wing to the Patent Office building, and may so connect the same with the present hall of said Patent Office building, containing the National Cabinet of Curiosities,’ as to constitute the said hall, in whole or in part, the deposit for the cabinet of the said Institution, if they deem it expedient to do so.” This plan was not adopted.
Section 6 of the same act provides that “in proportion as suitable
‘Goode. ‘Genesis of the United States National Museum,’’ page 328. *See Goode, op. cit., page 301.

<<<Page: 324>>>

arrangements can be made for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be arranged, in such order and so classed as best to facilitate the examination and study of them, in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the Institution.”
Considering the section relating to buildings mandatory, and under the belief that the collections belonging to the Government must be accepted and housed, the Board of Regents of the newly established Institution proceeded at once with the erection of a large brown stone structure.
For various reasons the building was many years in construction, and during this period the first secretary, Joseph Henry, became more and more pronounced in his opinion that the Government collections should not be cared for at the expense of the Smithsonian fund. Indeed, he was in doubt whether the Institution ought to form extensive miscellaneous collections to be maintained permanently at the expense of its funds, although he fully appreciated the value of collections, and, as will presently appear, labored to carry out the programme adopted for the Institution by acquiring and caring for such special collections as could be made the direct means of increasing and diffusing know]ledge. In the report for 1850 he remarked:
It would not be in accordance with the spirit of the organization to expend the income in the reproduction of collections of objects which are to be found in every museum of the country. Natural history can be much more effectively promoted by special collections of new objects, by appropriations for original explorations and researches, and, above all, by assistance in the preparation of the necessary drawings, and by presenting to the world, in a proper form, the labors of naturalists. In conformity with these views it has been resolved to confine the collections principally to objects of a special character, or to such as may lead to the discovery of new truths, or which may serve to verify or disprove existing or proposed scientific generalizations.!
Again, in the report for 1851, perhaps thinking that his position regarding museums might be misunderstood, he wrote:
I would distinctly disavow the intention of underrating the importance of collections in themselves. On the contrary, it ought to be the duty of the Smithsonian Institution to point out the means by which they may be made, and to aid in the work to the extent of its ability by embracing all opportunities which may ofter for procuring specimens for distribution and by facilitating exchange and assisting explorations.”
In the same connection he expressed his views regarding the importance of a National Museum in the following words:
Though the formation of a general collection is neither within the means nor the province of the Institution, it is an object which ought to engage the attention of

A genera] museum appears to be a necessary establishment at the seat of Government of every civilized nation. * * * An establishment of this kind can only be supported by Government; and the proposition ought never to be encouraged of putting this duty on the limited though liberal bequest of a foreigner. The Smithsonian Institution will readily take the supervision of an establishment of this kind, and give plans for its organization and arrangement, provided it be requested to do so and the means for effecting the object be liberally supplied. '
In 1850 Prof. Spencer F. Baird was appointed assistant secretary of the Institution, in charge of publications and museum. He brought with him from Carlisle, Pa., not only a considerable zoological collection assembled by his own activity, but, what was vastly more important, a system of recording, assorting, and distributing coilections which was sufficiently comprehensive and elastic to meet the needs of a great museum. In December, 1850, he placed in the hands of Secretary Henry a full outline of operations, which he afterwards carried into practice with the most signal success. He perceived that the numerous surveying parties which the Government was sending out from year to year into the Western Territories would be powerful agencies in increasing the knowledge of the natural history of the country if they could be induced to make collections of natural objects along the various routes they traversed. To this end the influence of the Institution was brought to bear on those officials of the Government who had the several surveys in charge.
The extent and torm of participation by the Institution in the explorations of the Government surveys varied in different cases. In some instances the Secretary of War was induced to grant an officer of the Army leave of absence for the purpose of making scientific explorations in some little-known part of the country. Again, the Institution furnished outfits and directions for collecting to such surgeons and other officers of the surveying and exploring parties as manifested an interest in natural-history explorations. In some cases the personnel of an exploring party included a naturalist of known abilities and experience, and the Institution furnished every facility for collecting.
On this point Professor Baird, referring to the Mexican Boundary and Pacific Railroad surveys, reported in 1853 as follows:
Without a single exception, all these parties have been fitted out at the Smithsonian Institution with all necessary instruments and apparatus for natural-history research, much of it contrived with special reference to the exigencies of the particular service involved. Full instructions were also supplied, by which persons
without previous practice were enabled to master all the general principles required for making observations and collections of every kind.?
The participation of the Institution also took the form of aid in the publication of results. Every year one or more publications based on the collections of the Government parties were published.
Fostered by the Institution to whose interest Professor Baird lent enthusiasm and untiring energy, the work of collecting yielded abun-

dant fruits. In 1853, three years after his arrival at the Institution, Professor Baird, having worked along the lines laid down by Henry in procuring such series of specimens as were calculated to open up new fields of study and to increase knowledge, was able to report on the wonderful development of the natural-history collections in the following words:
It may be well to call attention to the fact that it has been the work ‘of but three years to raise this collection from nothing to the front rank among American cabinets, exceeding all, perhaps, in the number of new species first brought to light within its limits. Nor has effort been confined merely to the acquisition of specimens, but to their concentration in mass, so as to supply all working naturalists with the materials of research. As already stated, applications for such assistance are constantly being received, and always met with all possible promptness; so that scarcely any natural history monograph or memoir of any extent has been published in this country within a year or two which has not been indebted in this way to the Institution. From the care, too, taken to keep separate all the localities, however near together, of any species, the collection affords information in reference to the geographical distribution of species of the very highest value.!
At the end of a decade, in 1860, Professor Henry was able to say:
The scientific material thus collected is very valuable, and, in number and variety of specimens and duplicates to illustrate the natural productions of the North American Continent, far excels any other collection ever made.?
While the Institution was thus exerting itself to obtain special collections to serve as the basis of research, the Commissioner of Patents was growing each year more desirous of having the use of the space occupied in the Patent Office by the national collections, and appealed frequently to Congress and to the Regents of the Institution to relieve him of their care.
In 1857, when Professor Henry brought the matter before them anew, they finally agreed that the transfer of the collections to the Smithsonian building should take place, but stipulated that an appropriation should be made to cover the expense of the transfer and the construction of cases in the Smithsonian building, and that the Secretary of the Interior should undertake to obtain from Congress, as before, an annual appropriation for the care of the collections. In his report for 1856, Secretary Henry said:
For the present, it may be well to adopt the plan suggested in a late report of the Commissioner of Patents, namely, to remove the museum of the Exploring Expedition, which now fills a large and valuable room in the Patent Office, wanted for the exhibition of models, to the spacious hall of the Institution, at present unoccupied, and to continue, under the direction of the Regents, the appropriation now annually made for the preservation and display of the collections.
Although the Regents, a few years ago, declined to accept this museum as a gift, yet, since experience has shown that the building will ultimately be filled with objects of natural history belonging to the General Government, which, for the good of science, it will be necessary to preserve, it may be a question whether, in consideration of this fact, it would not be well to offer the use of the large room immedi-

<<<Page: 327>>>

ately for a national museum, of which the Smithsonian Institution would be the mere curator, and the expense of maintaining which should be paid by the General Government.! }
‘“T can find no record in the minutes of the Regents,” writes Dr. Goode, “but have been informed by Mr. W. J. Rhees, of the Smithsonian Institution, that an urgent request for the use of the hall was made by the Commissioner of Patents and the Secretary of the Interior, and that the board decided to grant this request on the condition that Congress should appropriate money for the construction of the cases and the transfer of the collections, and that the Secretary of the Interior should provide for the expenses of the care of the collections after their transfer in the same manner as before.” ”
The collections were transferred to the Institution in 1858. Professor Baird reported that year’ that twelve separate collections were received from the Patent Office, of which the most considerable was the collection of the exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes. He estimated that the Patent Office collections together constituted about one-fifth of the objects in the Smithsonian museum. He pointed out also that there were then in the museum twenty-three other Government collections which had never been in the Patent Office. These were chiefly assembled by the different field parties of the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Survey, and other Government expeditions engaged in exploring the national domain.
The policy relating to the treatment of the collections adopted by the Institution was fully explained in the report of the Secretary for 1861, though in most of its essential features it was in operation as early as 1857. Secretary Henry remarks: *
The specimens may be divided into two classes—first, those which have been described in the reports of Government expeditions or the transactions of the Smithsonian and other institutions; and, second, those which have not been described, and which consequently are considered of much value by the naturalists who are interested in extending the several branches of natural history. Of both classes the Institution possesses a large number of duplicates, in the disposition of which some general principles should be kept constantly in view. After due consultation with naturalists, the following rules, which were presented in the last report, have been adopted relative to the described specimens:
First. To advance original science, the duplicate type specimens are to be distributed as widely as possible to scientific institutions in this country and abroad, in order that they may be used in identifying the species and genera which have been described.
Second. To promote education, as full sets as possible of general duplicates, properly labeled, are to be presented to colleges and other institutions of learning that profess to teach the principal branches of natural history.
Third. It must be distinctly understood that due credit is to be given to the Institution in the labeling of the specimens, and in all accounts which may be published
' Smithsonian Report, 1856, page 22.

<<<Page: 328>>>

of them, since such credit is not only due to the name of Smithson, but also to the directors of the establishment, as vouchers to the world that they are faithfully carrying out the intention of the bequest.
Fourth. It may be proper, in the distribution to institutions abroad, as a general rule, to require, in case type specimens to illustrate species which have been described by foreign authors may be wanted for comparison or other uses in this country, that they be furnished at any time they may be required.
Fifth. In return for specimens which may be presented to colleges and other educational establishments, collections from localities in their vicinity, which may be desirable, shall be furnished when required.
In the disposition of the undescribed specimens of the collection, it is impossible to be governed by rules quite as definite as those which relate to the previous class, but the following considerations have been adopted as governing principles:
1. The original specimens ought not to be intrusted to inexperienced persons, or to those who have not given evidence of their ability properly to accomplish the task they have undertaken.
2. Preference should be given to those who are engaged in the laborious and difficult task of preparing complete monographs.
3. As it would be illiberal to restrict the use of the specimens and confine the study of them to persons who can visit Washington, the investigator should be allowed to take them to his place of residence and to retain them for a reasonable time.
4. The investigator must give assurance that he will prepare a set of type specimens for the Smithsonian museum, and will return all the duplicates, if required.
5. In any publication which may be made of the results of the investigation, full credit must be accorded to the Institution for the facilities which have been afforded.
All these provisions on the part of the Institution were carried out as far as the circumstances would permit. The money available was insufficient for employing paid assistants to any considerable extent, and the Institution had the benefit of the voluntary assistance both of many recognized authorities in the several branches of science and of young students. The extent and importance of this aid can not be overestimated. Collections which would have remained useless for years were rapidly classified by competent naturalists and separated into series, some to be reserved by the Institution and others to be distributed to kindred scientific establishments and to colleges and schools.
The list of collaborators includes almost every name prominent in American natural history in the last half century. Nor is this a matter for wonderment. The collections made by the exploring parties of the Government in the twenty-five or thirty years following the founding of the Institution contained a great number of highly interesting forms of animals and plants previously unknown to science, and the naturalists in whose hands the various series were placed constantly enjoyed the delight of discovering these and making them known to the world. The boundaries of American natural history were widened in every direction. As regards vertebrates, Professor Baird remarked as early as 1856:
Messrs. Audubon and Bachman describe about 150 North American species of mammals. This Institution possesses about 130 of these; and about 50 additional

<<<Page: 329>>>

species have already been detected, although the examination of the entire collection has not yet been completed.
Of North American birds, the Institution possesses nearly all described by Audubon and at least 150 additional species.
Of reptiles, the North American species in the museum of the Smithsonian Institution amount to between 350 and 400. Of the 150 species described in Holbrook’s North American Herpetology, the latest authority on the subject, it possesses every genuine species, with one or two exceptions, and at least 200 additional ones. It has about 130 species of North American serpents for the 49 described by Holbrook.
Of the number of species of North American fishes it is impossible to form even an approximate estimate, the increase having been so great. It will not, however, be too much to say that the Institution has between 400 and 500 species either entirely new or else described first from its shelves.!
The scientific elaboration of the collections resulted in the publication of a great number of monographs and preliminary papers in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge and Miscellaneous Colleetions, in the reports of the Government surveys, and in the journals of learned societies at home and abroad. Many of the more comprehensive of these works remained as standards for a quarter of a century, and some have not been supplanted at the present day.
In this work no one labored with more enthusiasm or more success than Professor Baird, who, while carrying the burden of caring for the collections and planning for the exploration of new fields, prepared and published a series of works on North American vertebrates which commanded the admiration of naturalists throughout the world.
Side by side with the activities resulting in the increase of knowledge, the work of diffusing knowledge by the distribution of named natural history specimens was carried forward on an extensive scale. In the first twenty years of its history the Institution, according to the estimate of Professor Baird,’ distributed more than one hundred thousand specimens, of which the larger part were identified and labeled.
In 1861 the charter of the National Institute expired and the various objects belonging to that organization became the property of the Government and were transferred to the care of the Smithsonian Institution.
At this date, therefore, all the scientific and art collections belonging to the Government and the collections made by the Institution itself were assembled in the Smithsonian building. They comprised many thousands of objects, and were administered by Professor Baird as Assistant Secretary of the Institution.
From the time the Government came into possession, in 1841, of the collection made by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition Congress appropriated each year a small sum for the preservation of the objects accumulated in the Patent Office, which money was disbursed at first by the National Institute, afterward by the Commissioner of Patents or the Joint Library Committee of Congress.

<<<Page: 330>>>

After these collections were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution, in 1858, the appropriations for maintenance continued year by year, though small in amount. In 1858 the appropriation was $3,650; in 1859, and for eight years following, $4,000. The Institution never received any compensation for the occupancy of its building. As early as 1856! Professor Henry expressed the opinion at an early day that the Government might with.propriety and advantage purchase the Smithsonian building from the Institution for housing the Government collections “of natural history and the fine arts,” but no action in that direction was ever taken.
When these collections were transferred from the Patent Office a series of new cases, designed by Thomas U. Walter, were erected in the main hall of the Smithsonian building for their display. Great progress has been made in museum methods in the last two decades, but the cases, arrangement, labeling, and taxidermy in the Smithsonian museum thirty-five years ago were probably as good as could be found in any scientific museum in the world at that time. The exhibition of many examples of a single species of animal or mineral, or of a single kind of ethnological or geological object, was not considered objectionable, and it was a common practice to mount and exhibit type specimens of animals. To such matters as the size of glass in cases, the color of woodwork and labels, the effect of different groupings of specimens, little attention was devoted. Indeed, the amount of money spent upon scientific museums was not sufficient for great refinement in display. Collections were exhibited for the satisfaction of the mature man of science, rather than the youthful student and the layman. Yet these latter classes were neither purposely neglected nor did they complain of the methods in vogue.
It is with interest that we read the following comment by Professor Henry on the Smithsonian museum in 1861:
During the past year Washington has been visited by a greater number of strangers than ever before since the commencement of its history. The museum has consequently been continually thronged with visitors, and has beena never-failing source of pleasure and instruction to the soldiers of the Army of the United States quartered in this city or its vicinity. Encouragement has been given them to visit it as often as their duties would permit them to devote the time for the purpose.?
In 1865 an event of much importance occurred. A fire broke out in _ the second floor of the Smithsonian building and destroyed the upper portions of the edifice. Many collections were entirely destroyed or injured beyond repair, among which the most important were Smithson’s personal effects and cabinet of minerals, a large series of portraits of Indians painted and owned by J. M. Stanley, and the collection of physical instruments, including Hare’s experimental apparatus and “the lens used by Priestley for the evolution of oxygen from the oxide
1 Smithsonian Report, 1856, page 22. 2Tbid., 1861, page 44,

<<<Page: 331>>>

of mercury, and by means of which the first distinct recognition of this elementary substance was effected.” !
This event produced results affecting the Museum in many ways. It called attention to the fact that the library of the Institution was kept in rooms not fireproof, and the transfer of the books to the Library of Congress was hastened, the space being subsequently occupied by the less valuable portions of the natural history collections. By the destruetion of the Stanley portraits of Indians, which, though really an ethnological collection and only on deposit in the Institution, formed an important part of what (with frequent apologies) was called ‘the gallery of art,” the attempts to form an art collection of merit received discouragement. The reconstruction of the building, made necessary by the fire, led to a new assignment of rooms for the ethnological collections. Previous to the fire the upper story had been used principally as a lecture room, but the interest in lectures flagging for a time 1t was determined after the reconstruction to place the ethnological collections in that portion of the building, but the transfer was not effected until several years later.
Though the formation of an art gallery was provided for in the organization of the Institution and a few art objects came into the possession of the Government from time to time, Professor Henry took the position at an early day that with the funds available the establishment of an art collection worthy of the name was impossible. When Mr. W.W. Corcoran first took active steps toward the formation of the Corcoran Art Gallery, in 1869, Henry recommended that art objects belonging to the Institution should be deposited therein. In 1873 the Board of Regents approved the plan, and in the following year a few paintings, sculptures, and engravings were transferred.
In the early days of the Institution the valuable collection of engravings made by Hon. George P. Marsh was purchased (the only large purchase by the Institution in the direction of art), and soon after the fire in the Smithsonian building it was transferred to the Library of Congress.
By 1874, therefore, the Institution had detinitely abandoned all efforts toward the establishment of an art gallery, and though some few objects connected with the fine arts have come under its care in later years, they have never been assembled so as to form a proper “ gallery.”
In 1871 Congress established the United States Fish Commission and Professor Baird was placed at its head. The organization of the Commission on this basis had a most important effect upon the development of the National Museum in certain directions. The work of the Commission had to do largely with the natural history of fish and other aquatic animals, and in the course of a few years very large collections
‘Smithsonian Report, 1865, page 18.

<<<Page: 332>>>

of marine life were deposited in the Museum. Later the work of the Commission turned toward the investigation of the phenomena of the deep sea, and in 1882 a seagoing steamer, the Albatross, was built, and extensive sounding and dredging operations in great depths were carried on.
The collections made during the progress of this work, and deposited in the Museum, were of the highest scientific interest, and the results already published by Goode, Verrill, Bean, Rathbun, Smith, and other naturalists have attracted worldwide attention. In many other ways, which can not be detailed in the present connection, the work of the Commission was of direct and indirect benefit to the Museum, and the cooperation of these two governmental organizations has continued until the present.
Not many years after the organization of the Commission the question of the desirability of holding a great world’s fair to commemorate the hundredth anniversary cf the Declaration of Independence began to be agitated in the country. The movement culminated in the organization of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, held in Philadelphia. This event was destined to have a more important effect upon the National Museum than any which had occurred since the founding of the Smithsonian Institution.
The Government determined that the various departments and bureaus should make extensive exhibits indicating their several functions, and on January 23, 1874, the President appointed a Government board to have general charge. The Smithsonian Institution was represented by Professor Baird. In the first plans of the board the National Museum exhibit was included under that of the Institution, and the Fish Commission apparently under the Interior Department. They included also an item of $200,000 for an exhibition building which should be ‘‘capable of removal to Washington after the close of the Exhibition, to be used as a National Museum at the capital of the nation.”' Congress, however, saw fit to modify these plans and provided for the erection of a general Government building, to be paid for. pro rata from the appropriations of the several departments and bureaus, and to be sold at the close of the Exhibition. An appropriation of $67,000 was made for the Smithsonian Institution, and of $5,000 for the Fish Commission, the provision for the National Museum being included in the former. When the several officers of the board began to examine the situation in detail it became apparent that different bureaus would duplicate one another’s exhibits unless some compromise were made. Accordingly the exhibits of the Institution, the National Museum, and the Fish Commission were merged into one comprehensive exhibit; while, on the other hand, the National Museum cooperated with the Indian Bureau of the Interior Department in an
1 Smithsonian Report, 1875, page 59.

<<<Page: 333>>>

exhibit representing North American anthropology. The combined exhibit was divided into five sections—Smithsonian Activities, Animal Resources, Fisheries, Mineral Resources, Anthropology.
In the preparation of the exhibits of animal resources and fisheries, Professor Baird, then curator of the National Museum, had the assistance of G. Brown Goode, who held the position of assistant curator of the National Museum, Tarleton H. Bean, and H. C. Chester; in ethnology, Charles Rau, Edward Foreman, and F, H. Cushing; in mineral resources, William P. Blake and Thomas Donaldson.
When the idea of holding a great exhibition under the Government was first put forth, both Secretary Henry and Professor Baird foresaw that the effect on the National Museum inust be of the greatest moment. The objects purchased and exhibited by the Government of the United States would find their final resting place in the Museum, and many foreign governments and private exhibitors would doubtless present their exhibits to the United States, with the result that they also would find their way into the Museum.
The results of the operations of the Institution in connection with the Centennial Exhibition will probably have a much greater effect on the future of the establishment than is at first sight apparent. The large number of specimens which have been collected by the several departments of Government and by the Institution itself in view of this exhibition will greatly increase the contents of the National Museum, and if we add to these the specimens which will be presented by foreign powers, of which we have already had intimations, the number will be swelled to an extent far beyond the capacity of the present building to contain them, and an additional edifice will be required for their accommodation.
In the consideration of this matter the questions will arise whether the building required shall consist of an extension of the present Smithsonian edifice or an entirely separate building, and these questions will involve another, viz, whether it is advisable to continue, at least without some modification, the connection which now exists between the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum.
The Museum is destined to an extension far beyond its present magnitude. It is an object of much interest to all who visit the national capital, and is of great value as exhibiting the natural resources of the country, as well as a means of public education.
Professor Baird, as exhibition representative of the Institution, wrote in the report of the same year as follows:
It will, however, be readily understood that the Smithsonian building will be entirely inadequate to accommodate this collection on its return from Philadelphia, especially as even now it is overcrowded and packed from top to bottom with thousands of boxes, for the proper exhibition of the contents of which there is no space or opportunity at the present time. It is to be hoped that action at an early day will be taken by Congress looking toward a proper provision for this emergency, especially when it is realized that the materials are thus available for a national museum that shall be equal in its extent and completeness and in its educational advantages to that of any nation in the world.
The collections made directly through the Government appropriations wil! also be very largely supplemented by the donation of series of American and foreign exhibitors, a very large proportion of which will be placed at the disposal of the United States Government.

<<<Page: 334>>>

The anticipations of Henry and Baird were fully met. In the report for the centennial year Professor Baird wrote:
At no period in the history of the National Museum, from the time when it was organized to the present, has the increase been so great as during the year 1876."
After referring to the accessions from the Government exhibits, he remarks:
In addition, however, to the sources of increase to the Museum during the years 1875 and 1876, mentioned above, still another presented itself of perhaps even greater productiveness, viz, acquisitions from foreign exhibits. With scarcely an exception, the best and most important of these were presented to the United States at the close of the exhibition, embracing as they did many complete series of objects illustrating the geology, metallurgy, the ethnology, and the general resources of all nations. Of about forty governments and colonies, the choicest of the exhibits of thirty-four were presented to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Museum, the remainder either having nothing to give or being restricted in the disposal of their articles.
It was, however, not from foreign commissions alone that collections were received by the Institution. Several entire State exhibits and many belonging to private parties were also added to the general increase. Nevada, Montana, and Utah presented the whole of their mineral exhibits, while partial collections were received from several other States and Territories.
The Regents of the Institution submitted a memorial to Congress the same year (1876) asking an appropriation of $250,000 for a building for the National Museum. A bill was introduced, but failed of passage that year, and it was not until 1879 that the amount asked for was provided.
As soon as the law was enacted a building commission appointed by the Regents of the Institution was organized, consisting of the resident members of the executive committee of the Institution (Hon. Peter Parker and Gen. W. T. Sherman) and Secretary Baird. General Sherman was chosen as chairman and Gen. M. C. Meigs was invited to act as consulting engineer. .
The commission selected the firm of Cluss & Schulze, whose design. for the building had been approved by Congress, as superintending architects, and received the benefit of the advice of Mr. Edward Clarke, Architect of the Capitol.
The erection of the building was begun April 17, 1879, and completed in 1881. In design the structure is of the type commonly employed for exhibition buildings, being entirely open above the ground floor. It covers a space of 24 acres. On account of the relatively small amount appropriated for the building and the enormous growth of the national collections, it was necessary to use building materials of low cost and to cover in aS much space as possible. The building is regarded as one of the cheapest of its size ever erected. While admirably adapted in most respects for the purpose for which it was built, it does not, of course, present, either externally or internally, an appearance as pleas-

<<<Page: 335>>>

ing or dignified as would have resulted from the use of a more expensive system of construction and more costly materials.
While the building was under construction, Congress decided that the United States Government should be represented at the Berlin Fisheries Exhibition of 1880 by the Fish Commission. Professor Baird, then both Secretary of the Institution and Fish Commissioner, appointed G. Brown Goode, the curator of the National Museum, as his deputy at the exhibition. By this fortunate combination of circumstances, Dr. Goode, the working head of the National Museum, was afforded an opportunity to study the museums of Germany and other parts of Europe, and brought home with him a knowledge of the most approved methods of installation of collections, labeling, and storage, which was invaluable. Far more fortunate was it that the Museum at this critical time in its history had as its curator a man of such surpassing merit as the lamented editor of this volume.! Gifted with a philosophical mind, a profound love of nature, a marvelously retentive memory, and untiring energy. he acquired a range of knowledgeand a grasp of affairs which astonished his associates, while his modesty, gentleness, and love of fair play attracted to him and bound to his service men of the most diverse capacities and opinions. His genius was known to Secretary Baird, but hitherto he had not found a sufficiently wide field for the exercise of his powers. The reorganization of the Museum afforded an opportunity, and Baird gave him free scope for the development of his plans, aiding him as no one else could have done, from the stores of a lifetime of experience along the same lines.
Out of the heterogeneous materials accumulated by the Government, especially as a result of the Centennial Exhibition, Dr. Goode organized, under the approving guidance of Secretary Baird, a public museum ot wide scope, attractive, instructive, orderly, and full of the elements of life. He elaborated with the greatest pains a philosophical and comprehensive classification for the collections of the Museum, and planned a complete reorganization of the staff of curators and assistants. He devised an entirely new series of cases and other fixtures, for the installation of both the collections exhibited to the public and those reserved for the use of investigators, adopting the best features then developed in European museums, and adding many of his own invention.
This regeneration of the National Museum soon made itself felt in similar organizations throughout the United States and in other parts of the world, and the methods of installation and labeling employed in Washington have been widely copied.
The influence of the National Museum has not, however, stopped here. Already at the Berlin Fisheries Exhibition of 1880, with the experience gained during the Centennial Exhibition, Dr. Goode was
'The History of the Smithsonian Institution, from which this article is extracted, was edited by Dr. Goode. NAT MUS 96

able to secure for the United States Fish Commission and the National Museum the Emperor’s prize for the highest excellence of display. Not satisfied with this recognition, and always aiming to advance, he endeavored to install the exhibits of the Institution and Museum at later foreign and domestic exhibitions, in accordance with the best museum methods. As a result the exhibits of the Institution always won high praise, and it is not too much to say that the work of the National Museum in this direction has had a powerful influence in revolutionizing exhibition methods in America.
Since the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 few years have passed in which the Museum has not been engaged in preparing for public exposition of greater or less magnitude. It made displays at London in 1883, at Louisville in 1884, at Minneapolis in 1887, Cincinnati and Marietta in 1888, at Madrid in 1892, at Chicago in 1893, and at Atlanta in 1895. As might naturally be expected, the necessity of carrying on exhibition work outside of Washington has affected the National Museum in many ways.
Probably no other great permanent museum in the world has had constantly before it the problem of guarding its treasures from deterioration and at the same time transporting no inconsiderable portion of them thousands of miles and displaying them under the ordinarily unfavorable surroundings of temporary exhibitions. The advantages lie in the direction of making the work of the Museum known to the people of the Republic and the world at large and securing new objects with which to fill out the deficiencies in its various collections. The disadvantages are found in damage done to objects in the collections, by breakage or otherwise, the interruption of the regular Museum work, and the dissipation of the energies of the scientific officers; for a museum, like any other permanent institution, requires abundant time and uninterrupted activity for its best development, and does not flourish in the midst of commotion and excitement.
Thus far I have considered the National Museum in its historical aspects. It remains to explain briefly its function and aims and to mention the most notable objects in its collections.
It will be perceived, from the statements already made, that the Museum is essentially a natural development springing from the activities of the Government, growing with their growth and expanding with their expansion. It had its origin in the great naval exploring expedition which the Government organized in the early part of the century, and found an important expansion in the long series of topographical surveys of the public domain and geological surveys of later years. The scientific investigation of the primary industries—agriculture, fisheries, and mining—by the Government have also resulted in large additions to the Museum. Finally, the desire on the part of the Government that the people should gain a better understanding of its practical workings, through representative displays of processes and objects in

<<<Page: 337>>>

the great public exhibitions, have broadened the activities and increased the wealth of the Museum, both directly and indirectly; directly, because the Museum has need to bestir itself to bring together and arrange exhibits which will be acceptable to the public; indirectly, because the participation of the Government of the United States often leads other governments to participate, and the exhibits of these, in greater or less proportion, are ultimately presented to the United States for its National Museum.
The field of activities of the Government has had a strong influence on the character of collections of its National Museum. While European governments have been engaged in exploring new regions and founding colonies in distant sections of the globe, that of the United States has confined its attention almost exclusively to North America. The collections of the National Museum, therefore, are predominantly North American. Leaving out of consideration the important foreign collections of a few early expeditions, and those resulting from the deepsea investigations of the United States Fish Commission, the additions in this direction have chiefly come from the activities of private explorers, by gift of foreign governments at expositions, by exchange of specimens, and only in a few instances by purchase.
In the organic law of the Smithsonian Institution it is provided that— in proportion as suitable arrangements can be made for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be, shall be delivered to sueh persons as may be authorized by
the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be arranged in such order and so classed as best to facilitate the examination and study of them.
In the act of June 30, 1880, making appropriations for the sundry civil expenses of the Government, it is enacted that “all collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no longer needed for investigations in progress, shall be deposited in the National Museum.” !
In the same year, as we have said, Congress appropriated money ‘for a fireproof building for the use of the National Museum.”
As may be seen from the statutes cited, the National Museum is the recognized depository for all objects of scientific and artistic interest and value which come into the possession of the Government. Its function is to preserve these treasures perpetually, and to administer the collections in such a manner as to render them of the highest service to research and education. In pursuance of these ends it exhibits a portion of the collections for public inspection and instruc. tion; another portion it assembles in laboratories for the use of investi-

gators. Out of the surplus accumulations it selects series of specimens for distribution to educational institutions, and it encourages publications which will make its treasures known to the world. Of these latter activities it will be necessary to speak somewhat more in detail before closing, and I will return to them presently. It is desirable to point out here the fact, which will become evident to any one upon reflection, that an institution such as the National Museum, with its facilities for investigation and its corps of trained specialists, soon becomes a center of intellectual activity, attracting to itself students and savants, and being called upon to impart technical information and advice. In these lines lies no inconsiderable part of its labor and usefulness.
It is to be said further that the Museum of to-day, owing in part to a natural development and in part to the labors of a few advanced leaders, among whom none have rendered more important service than the late Dr. Goode, is no longer content with a passive existence, but strives by the arrangement of its collections, by its labels, its handbooks and other publications, and its lectures, to impart instruction of a definite character and in definite lines. It assembles great collections of natural objects and treasures of art, not merely to satisfy idle curiosity but to diffuse knowledge among men. Thus it allies itself to the university and the library, and must be counted among the chief agencies for the spread of culture.
To describe in detail all the more important objects in the National Museum would require more space than can be devoted to such an enumeration in this place, but it will be of interest to point out the chief excellencies of the collections and to mention some of the treasures.
The collections are at present divided among the following departments and sections:
Zoological departments: Mammals, Birds (with a section of Birds’ Eggs), Reptiles and Batrachians, Fishes, Mollusks, Insects, Marine Invertebrates (with a section of Parasitic Worms), Comparative Anatomy.
A Botanical Department.
Geological departments: Geology, Mineralogy, and Paleontology.
Anthropological departments: Prehistoric Anthropology, Ethnology (with a section of American Pueblo Collections), Oriental Antiquities.
A Department of “Arts and Industries,” with the following sections at present: Historical Relics, Transportation and Engineering, Naval Architecture, Physical Apparatus, Electrical Collections, Technological Collections, Materia Medica, Forestry, and Graphie Arts.
The Department of Mammals comprises the collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition and of the numerous geographical and geological surveys of the public domain, including the type specimens of species described by Baird in his great work on North American Mammals, and numerous types of J. A. Allen, Elliott Coues, Harrison Allen, and

<<<Page: 339>>>

other American naturalists. The collections from the Mexican boundary recently made by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. A., are large and of high scientific value.'
A series of casts of porpoises and other cetaceans, including a young humpback whale, forms a unique feature of the department.
The representation of foreign mammals, though deficient in many directions, includes a considerable number of type specimens and some important local collections, chief among which are those from German East Africa and from Kashmir and Eastern Turkestan, made and presented by Dr. William L. Abbott.
The collection of skulls of North American mammals is probably unrivaled elsewhere in extent, and the department also contains a large alcoholic series.
Of the Department of Birds the curator, Mr. Robert Ridgway, writes:
Among the most important collections and single objects contained in the Department of Birds are the following:
1. The collections made by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the various Pacific Railroad surveys, the Mexican Boundary Survey, the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, the Geological Survey of the Territories, Geographical Surveys West of the One Hundredth Meridian, the United States Astronomical Expedition (Gilliss), and various other Government expeditions.”
2. The collection made by Col. A. J. Grayson in Western Mexico, including the Tres Marias and Revilla-Gigedo islands; collections made by Prof. F. Sumichrast on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and by Prof. C. Sartorius in the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico; collections made by F. A. Ober in the various islands of the Lesser Antilles.
3. The collections made by the United States Fish Commission during a cruise of the steamer Albatross around Cape Horn and in the Bahamas.
4. Specimens from Audubon’s collection, among them a considerable number of types of his new species—that is, specimens from which the descriptions and colored plates in his great work were taken. These formed part of Professor Baird’s private collection, and were given by Mr. Audubon to Professor Baird.
5. The private collection of Professor Baird, numbering nearly four thousand specimens, which formed the nucleus or beginning of the present national collection.
6. Other private collections donated to the National Museum.
7. The collections made by Dr. William L. Abbott in Eastern Africa, Madagascar, etc., generously presented to the National Museum and embracing a very large number of species entirely new to the Museum collection, many of them being new to science. These collections of Dr. Abbott, moreover, represent practically all that the Museum possesses from the countries named.
8. The collection of several thousand specimens from various parts of the world, presented by Mr. A. Boucard, of Spring Vale, Isle of Wight, England.
9. Extinet Birds: Great Auk (one specimen), Labrador Duck (several), Guadelupe Caracara (good series, old and young), and Philip Island Parrot, the latter purchased for the Museum by Dr. William L. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y.
' The very extensive series of North American mammals made by the United States Department of Agriculture under Dr. C. Hart Merriam, the finest ever assembled, is deposited in the Museum building and catalogued in its registers.
*The valuable collections of birds made by the United States Department of Agriculture under direction of Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the United States and Mexico are deposited in the Museum building, as in the case of the mammals.

<<<Page: 340>>>

10. Very rare species, or those nearly extinct, as the Carolina Paroquet, Ivorybilled Woodpecker, Black-capped and Jamaican Petrels, Hawaiian Coot, Cuban Macaw, Peale’s Sandpiper (several specimens, the only ones known to exist in collections), and numerous other species.
11. Unique types, such as Fisher’s Petrel, Townsend’s Bunting, Cooper’s Sandpiper, Cooper’s Hen-Hawk, Riker’s Woodhewer.
The National Museum collection of North American birds is by far the most complete in existence, and is the basis of every important work on North American birds since Audubon’s time. That of the birds of the West Indies is also the most important, although exceeded greatly in number by that of Mr. C. B. Cory, now the property of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago, Il. That of Central American and South American birds is exceeded in extent and value only by the British Museum’s series of birds from the same region, and has been freely used by Messrs. Selater, Salvin, Godman, Count von Berlepsch, and others in their various publications on neotropical birds, and is also largely the basis of Professor Baird’s ‘‘ Review of American Birds.”
Museums throughout the world have been supplied with American birds by the United States National Museum, and the existing specimens of several species, such as the Roseate Gull, Greenland Redpoll, and several Alaskan species, have mainly—in some cases exclusively—been distributed by the National Museum.
It can safely be said that no collection of birds in the world compares with that of the United States National Museum in value or importance as a basis for scientific investigation already accomplished or yet to be done, since as many species as possible, with the facilities at command, are represented by large series of specimens from all parts of their geographical range and of all known variations dependent on climate, sex, age, or other circumstances.
The unparalleled collection of North American birds’ eggs in the United States National Museum is the result of many years’ growth. In the early years of the Institution Professor Bird interested the naturalists of the various Government surveys and members of the Hudson Bay Fur Company in the subject, and from them (and especially the latter) thousands of eggs were received. Mr. R. McFarlane! was particularly active, and with him were associated B. R. Ross, James Lockhart, John Reid, M. McLeod, A. McKenzie, and others, who sent not only eggs, but large collections of other kinds. The Institution sent Robert Kennicott to Arctic America in 1859, where he remained three years, collecting the natural productions of the region, and with them many eggs of Arctic birds.
Naturalists visiting Alaska and Labrador also made large contributions to the oblogical collections. The eggs of the rare northern water birds and waders so difficult to obtain for private collections were thus sent (often in large series) to the Institution.
In 1884 Major Bendire added to the already large collection his unrivaled series of eggs of western birds, obtained during twenty-five years of duty in the Territories. This collection numbered eight thousand or more beautifully prepared specimens. From that time till his death Major Bendire was untiring in his efforts to obtain the desiderata of the collection. More recently Dr. William L. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., has presented his magnificent collection of eggs to the Institution, and is now actively engaged in filling gaps in the series.
To mention specifically all the rarities in the North American series of the odlogical department would be an almost endless task. A few of the more important ones are the following: Great Auk, one egg; Heermann’s Gull, two eggs; Craveri’s Murrelet, two eggs; Jabiru, one egg; Purple, Aleutian, Coues’s, Baird’s, Pectoral, Whiterumped, and Curlew Sandpipers; Sanderling, two specimens (McFarlane); Heath Hen, one peerage) Passenger Pigeon, about ent eggs; California Vulture, one

egg; Harlan’s, Krider’s, and Short-tailed Hawks; Peale’s, Richardson’s, and Aplomado; Elf, Flammulated, and Californian Pigmy Owls; Carolina Paroquet; Ivorybilled Woodpecker; White-throated and Vaux’s Swifts; Clarke’s Nut-cracker, several eggs; Western Evening Grosbeak; American and Mexican Crossbills; Pribilof Snowflake, several. Among the rare warblers may be mentioned: Brewster’s, Virginia’s, Lucy’s, Cape May, Olive, Sennett’s, Grace’s, Townsend’s, Hermit, Golden-checked, Gray, and Connecticut Warblers; Rio Grande and Belding’s Yellow-throats; Redfaced Warblers.
Of foreign eggs may be mentioned Kamtschatkan Sea Eagle, Quesal, etc. Also various series of eggs, like those collected by Dr. Jerome H. Kidder on Kerguelen Island, Dr. William L. Abbott in Africa, Seychelles Islands, Asia, ete. On some of these reports have been made.!
Of the Department of Reptiles and Batrachians, the curator, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, remarks:
The distinctive characteristic of the reptile collection in the Museum is in the completeness with which it illustrates the geographical distribution and morphology of the species inhabiting North America. In this respect it stands unrivaled. As the depository of the types of the species described by Baird, Girard, Kennicott, Cope, and other distinguished American herpetologists it also takes first rank.
The importance of the individual collections must therefore be judged with reference to their richness in such types and the advance in our knowledge of the reptiles and batrachians of this continent that has ensued. The collections which have undoubtedly contributed most in these respects are those of the Pacific Railroad surveys, the first Mexican-United States Boundary Survey, and the Wilkes Exploring Expedition.
The collection of fishes are almost exclusively North American, with one notable exception in the case of the deep-sea fishes dredged by the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The latter collection is of equal importance with that of the Challenger expedition, if it does not surpass the same, and formed the basis of the recent work of Dr. Goode and Dr. Bean on ‘““Oceanic Ichthyology.”
The department contains the most extensive collections of freshwater and littoral fishes of the United States anywhere assembled, consisting chiefly of the great series formed by the United States Fish Commission, supplemented by the collections of many American naturalists. The collection of Alaskan fishes is very large and is not extensively duplicated elsewhere.
The series of fishes collected in connection with the Pacific Railroad surveys and the first Mexican Boundary Survey are of special importance as containing the types of a large proportion of the species of the middle and western United States. They have been supplemented in recent years by important series collected under the auspices of the Fish Commission and by private collectors.

oi2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1896.
The department contains also many single specimens of great value, which have been made the basis of new families and genera.
Regarding the Department of Mollusks, Mr. William H. Dall, the honorary curator, writes as follows:
The collection of mollusks was founded primarily upon the specimens gathered by the United States Exploring Expedition under Wilkes during 1838-1842, which formed the types of the folio volume on the mollusks and shells by Dr. A. A. Gould, included in the series of United States Exploring Expedition reports published by Congress. ‘To these were added the types of the mollusks of the North Pacific Exploring Expedition under Ringgold and Rodgers, collected by Dr. William Stimpson, and described by Gould. The collections were very rich and valuable, for the time, but underwent serious vicissitudes before and after being received by the Smithsonian Institution previous to the organization of the Museum, so that the series as it now exists is by no means complete. Nevertheless these shells form an interesting and important portion of the collection.
Next in point of number and value comes the collection, especially of Unionide, given by Dr. Isaac Lea, and subsequently enriched by his son-in-law and daughter, the Rev. and Mrs. LL. T. Chamberlain. This collection is, in its specialties, the freshwater mussels of the world, unrivaled for extent and value, comprising an enormous number of types and having full data in relation to the habitat, etc., in nearly every case.
Almost as important for the mollusks of Great Britain, Northern Europe, the Mediterranean, and especially for the various deep-sea dredging expeditions sent out under British auspices before the Challenger expedition, is the Jeffreys collection, purchased from Dr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys, and comprising the results of nearly half a century of active collecting, exchanging, and purchase—in all some 25,000 lots of specimens, by far the most important and complete series of British shells in existence, and forming the basis of some hundred publications.
The fauna of West America, both littoral and deep-sea mollusks, is represented by the combined collections of Robert E. C. Stearns, William H. Dall, the United States steamer Albatross of the Fish Commission, the Arctic cruisers of the United States revenue marine, and many private donations, in all comprising the most complete existing representation of the fauna, with full data in nearly every case.
The fauna of the east coast of North America is represented by the unrivaled collections of the United States Fish Commission, angumented by a series of those of the Blake and many private collectors in the West Indies and on our Southern coast.
The land and fresh-water shells of North America, apart from the fresh-water mussels, are represented by the best existing collection derived from many sources, including types of Binney and Bland, Lea, Lewis, Dall, Stimpson, and many others.
To sum up, the collection of mollusks has the best series in the world, supplied with the fullest data, in the modern sense, of the land, fresh-water, shore, and deepsea mollusks of North America, the Arctic regions, the North Atlantic and Pacific, and the British Islands. In the total number of specimens, the collection is the largest in the world, including over six hundred thousand specimens of dry shells and five thousand jars af alcoholic molluscan material. The collection of Cenozoic fossil shells comprises the largest existing series of the Tertiary fauna of the United States, and probably the largest series of Antillean Tertiary shells in any museum, though much remains to be done in naming and classifying the fossil material.
It may be said without fear of contradiction that for the regions mentioned the Department of Mollusks is unrivaled, not only in the amount and variety of material it contains, but especially in the full and correct data recorded in respect to the specimens, and which give to them a really scientific value, which is wanting in most of the great collections of the world, which were mostly made at a period when the importance of such data was not fully recognized. No other collection contains

AN ACCOUNT OF THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM aks
nearly as many American and British type specimens; and only the British Museum rivals ours in the number of species represented from the whole world. No other collection has so large a representation of deep-sea mollusks and brachiopods, for the study of which the national collection is indispensable.
Of the Department of Insects, Dr. L. O. Howard, the honorary curator, writes:
Taking the collection as a whole, and aside from the consideration of the individual collections of which it is composed, I should say that its most important features are, first, the rapidly accumulating number of types in all orders, amounting already to more than 3,500 species; and, second, the biologic features of the collection, due largely to the fact that the original deposit by Dr. Riley was mainly biologic in its character, and to the further fact that the biologic accumulations of the United States Department of Agriculture for seventeen years, which have been very great, are now in the possession of the Museum.
The subjoined statement refers to the source of the different collections now brought together. Looking at the collection as a whole, however, the departments which stand out conspicuously are (a) the collection of North American Noctuids (probably the most complete in existence), (>) the collection of parasitic Hymenoptera (undoubtedly the largest collection of bred specimens in the world), (c) the orthopterous family, Acridiid, (d) the homopterous families Coccidz, Aphidiidx, and Psyllide (without doubt the largest accumulation of North American species), (e) the dipterous families Syrphide and Empide, (/) the collection of Myriopoda.
The department is at present in excellent working condition. It contains a very great amount of material in all orders, and in many unusual directions surpasses any collection in the country. Among others the following are of special interest:
1. The large collection, in all orders, of Dr. C. V. Riley.
2. All of the material gathered during the past eighteen years by correspondents, field agents, and the office staff of the Division of Entomology, United States Department of Agriculture.
3. The greater part of the collection of Asa Fitch.
4. The large collection, in all orders, of G. W. Belfrage.
5. The collections in Lepidoptera and Coleoptera made by Dr. John B. Smith down to 1889, together with the types of the Noctuidie since described by Dr. Smith.
6. The collection of Lepidoptera of O. Meske.
7. The collection of Lepidoptera of G. Beyer.
8. The collection of Coleoptera of M. L. Linell.
9. The bulk of the collection, in all orders, of H. K. Morrison.
10. The collection of Diptera of Edward Burgess.
11. The type collection of Syrphide made by Dr. S. W. Williston.
12. The collection of Ixodidie of Dr. George Marx.
13. The collection of Myriopoda of C. H. Bollman.
14. Sects of the neo-tropical collections of Herbert H. Smith.
15. The collection of Hymenoptera of William J. Fox.
16. The collection of Tineina of William Beutenmiiller.
17. The large Japanese collection, in all orders, of Dr. K. Mitsukuri.
18. The African collections, in all orders, of Dr. W. L. Abbott, William Astor Chanler, J. F. Brady, the Eclipse expedition of 1889-90 to West Africa, and of several missionaries. ;
19. The large collection from south California of D. W. Coquillett, in Coleoptara, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera.
20. The Townend Glover manuscripts and plates.
In addition to this material, there are minor collections which have been the result of the work of Government expeditions, or are gifts from United States consuls and many private individuals.

<<<Page: 344>>>

The most beautiful, and in many respects the most important, of the numerous series in the Department of Marine Invertebrates is the collection of corals made by the United States Exploring Expedition, and described by Dana. It includes many types of new forms. The ereat deep-sea collections from the North Atlantic and North Pacific, made by the United States Fish Commission, deserve notice; as do also the exhaustive collections from the New England Coast and the Fishing Banks, and from the west coast of Alaska, received from the same source. All the collections are very rich in the types of new species and higher groups.
Among the notable specimens in the Department of Comparative Anatomy should be mentioned the skulls and partial skeletons of the great extinct Arctic Seacow (Rytina); several skeletons of huge Galapagos Tortoises; and an unrivaled series of bones of the Great Auk. The collection is rich in skulls and skeletons of the various species of porpoises.
In the Department of Geology the following series and separate objects are pointed out by Dr. George P. Merrill as deserving special mention:
1. The Leadville, Colo., collections of rocks and ores, comprising some 380 specimens, illustrating the work of 8. F. Emmons and Whitman Cross,!
2. The Washoe collections, comprising 198 specimens, as selected and studied by George F. Becker.?
3. The collections of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. These comprise some 3,000 specimens of eruptive and sedimentary rocks collected by members of the Fortieth Parallel Survey, under the direction of Clarence King, in 1867-1873. The eruptive rocks of the series were described by Prof. Ferdinand Zirkel.®
4. The Hawes collections. These comprise some 350 specimens of eruptive altered rocks, representing in part the work done by Dr. Hawes in connection with the New Hampshire surveys.‘ It also includes the small fragments described in his paper® on the Albany granites and their contact phenomena.
5. The Pacific Slope quicksilver collections. These comprise several hundred small specimens (mostly 4 by 6 em.) of rocks and ores from the quicksilver regions of the locality above noted, as collected and described by G. F. Becker® and colleagues in ‘Geology of the Quicksilver Deposits of the Pacific Slope.”
6. Pigeon Point collections. These comprise 400 specimens illustrating various contact phenomena, as occurring at Pigeon Point, on the north shore of Lake Superior,
and as described by Prof. W. 8S. Bailey in a bulletin’ of the United States Geological Survey.

whole is doubtless the most complete and systematic of its kind in any museum in the world.
In the economic section are very full and systematic collections illustrating the mineral resources of the United States, arranged geographically, and also a systematie series in which minerals of the same nature and from world-wide sources are arranged by kinds. This collection comprises probably not fewer than 10,000 specimens.
Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator of the Department of Botany, furnishes the following brief account of the collection of plants:
With reference to the collections in the Department of Botany, it may be said that they constitute what is commonly known as te National Herbarium. The nucleus of the herbarium consisted of the plants collected by the Wilkes exploring expedition during the years 1838 to 1842. To these were added later the material from the North Pacific exploring expedition of Ringgold and Rodgers, followed by those of
Frémont, the Mexican Boundary Commission, the Pacific Railroad surveys, and all
the later explorations and expeditions of the Government.
In recent years the largest amount of material received has come from the Division of Botany in the Department of Agriculture, material brought together in the pursuit of the investigations of that establishment. Especially noteworthy among these is the collection of grasses which Dr. George Vasey gathered during his studies of the forage plants of the United States during a period of about twenty years.
To the collections of the exploring expeditions and those of the Department of Agriculture has been added a large amount of material donated by American botanists or purchased from collectors, besides large consignments of plants received from various foreign institutions or individuals principally as gifts or in exchange.
The collections of the exploring expeditions and the collection of grasses are especially rich in type specimens.
Mention should be made of the collections of George Joad, comprising about 10,000 species of representative plants of the globe, more especially those of Europe; and the collection of Prof. Lester F. Ward, comprising the specimens on which his ‘ Flora of Washington and vicinity” is based, in addition to important collections made by Professor Ward and his correspondents in other parts of the United States. Both the Ward and the Joad collections were acquired by the Museum in 1885.
The important collections of the Department of Minerals are summarized by Mr. Wirt Tassin, assistant curator, as follows:
At the request of Prof. F. W. Clarke, the honorary curator, I have prepared, and transmit herewith, a list of some of the most important collections and single objects in the Mineral Department. They are:
The Isaac Lea collections, including a collection of minerals, a collection of micas and quartzes, and a collection of gems and ornamental stones, among which may be noted as of especial interest a fine green tourmaline of 57 carats, a red specimen of 18 carats, and a hair-brown one of 16 carats, from Mount Mica, Paris, Me; a doubly terminated emerald crystal from Stony Point, Alexander County, N. C., one of the largest ever found, measuring 3.1 by 2 inches and weighing 8 ounces and 3 pennyweights; a crystal ball cut from North Carolina quartz; a silver nugget weighing 448 ounces, from near Globe, Ariz; one of the largest known cut Ceylon essonites; four large Ceylon asteria; a fine suite of opals in argillaceous limonite, Baracoo River, Queensland.

A slab of sodalite, size 2 by 2 inches; a polished slab of labradorite, 2 by 2 inches; a slab of calcite crystals, 4 by 4 inches; two large sections of agatized wood from Arizona, deposited by the Drake Company; the Ontonagon copper bowlder; a series of Sicilian sulphur crystals; the Shepard collections of meteorites; the Ring or Irwin meteorite; a suite of meteoric irons from Canyon Diablo, Arizona, varying in weight from 964 pounds to a few ounces.
To the list may be added the Stroud collection, the Hawes collection, the Abert collection, the various accessions received at different times from the United States Geological Survey, and other smaller collections containing valuable material of scientific and other importance.
Of the Department of Paleontology, Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator, writes:
The feature of greatest importance is that much of our material has served in Goyernment reports and is the basis for the geological and paleontological work treating of the western part of our country. This fact is well exemplified in the great number of species which have served in description and illustration, many of which are the original type specimens. There are of such species 5,741. These are distributed in the sections of this department as follows:

The most complete series is the Lacoe collection of American Paleozoic plants, the labeled specimens of which alone number upward of 18,000, and of these more than 500 species have been described or illustrated by Lesquereux and White. This magnificent collection is the result of many years’ accumulation, and cost upward of $50,000. It was donated to this Museum in 1891 by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa,
The collection of Cambrian fossils is very large, and when Mr. Walcott shall have completed his studies upon this material it will be the most complete and valuable series of fossils of this system extant.
The Cretaceous collection is also quite extensive and represents much work by F. B. Meek, C. A. White, and T. W. Stanton.
The Tertiary collection of Mollusca is one of the conspicuous features of this department. This collection was accumulated chiefly by William H. Dall.
Among single objects the following deserve mention:
A composite slab of Lower Carboniferous fossils measuring 4 by 6 feet, and showing in high relief 106 crinoids (16 species) and other fossils.

<<<Page: 348>>>

A Lepinodendron trunk 3 feet wide and 30 feet long (Lacoe collection).
A series of 6 cycad trunks from the Lower Cretaceous of South Dakota.
Bones representing a nearly complete Zeuglodon cetoides from the Eocene of Alabama, and of which a life-sized restoration is exhibited.
Skulls and limb bones of the huge Cretaceous dinosaur, Triceratops, from Wyoming.
An excellent skeleton of the Irish elk, Megaceros hibernicus Owen.
The collections of the Department of Prehistoric Anthropology are thus described by the curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson:
There are three great stages of culture, or civilization, represented in this department, which are separated and installed according to locality.
The first, and probably the earliest, is that of western Europe, of which the Museum possesses an extensive collection, the largest in the United States, showing the culture of prehistoric man, from the earliest times down to the Bronze Age and the Etruscans, where it joins history.
The second great division represents the territory of the United States and British Columbia. This constitutes the bulk of the collection, and comprises the hatchets, axes, implements, and other objects of stone. The mounds of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys have yielded large representations of pottery.
The third stage of culture is that belonging to Mexico and Central America, variously called Aztec and similar local names. While it comprises many stone implements, it extends further and wider than either of the foregoing, having jade, obsidian, and gold objects and ornaments. Its pottery is fine and beautifully made and decorated, while some of the ruder pieces, representing gods, especially from Mexico, are made with a wealth of detail that has increased the difficulty of manufacture almost beyond the belief of possibility in savage life.
The display from South America is important, resembling the culture of Central America more than that of North America.
The department has one of the richest displays of prehistoric objects in the United States. It contains more than 250,000 objects, which it is impossible toname. They, however, are divided both technologically and geographically, and by comparison in these two regards the endeavor is made to determine the stage of culture and obtain some insight into the history of prehistoric man.
Regarding the Department of Ethnology, the curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, writes:
The ethnological collection of the Museum relates chiefly to the North American Indians, but it includes also valuable series of objects from Polynesia, obtained by the United States Exploring Expedition, such as the old Tapa cloths and weapons, which are no longer obtainable.
The Eskimo collection is unrivaled. The collections of the Bureau of Ethnology and other Government surveys on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean in North America and in the Pueblo region of the southwestern United States are the most extensive and valuable ever assembled. Among single objects of high value and rarity may be mentioned a large jade knife from Alaska, obtained by E. W. Nelson; a fine series of boats and totem posts from the west Pacific Coast of America, by J. G. Swan. In the Powell collection there are rare old pieces of pottery from the ruined pueblos. A Hawaiian feather cloak, of large size and well preserved, also deserves mention.
I present the following list of the most conspicuous and useful collections in alphabetical order, by collectors:
A collection of great value from eastern Africa, Kashmir, and southeastern Asia, by Dr. William L. Abbott, of Philadelphia; a collection illustrative of the ethnography of Korea, by Lieut. J. B. Bernadou, U.S.N.; a collection from the department of education in Japan to illustrate the practical industries of this country, in com

In addition to those already named should be mentioned the various branches of the United States executive service, the Department of State, the War Department, the Navy Department, and the Department of the Interior.
Of the Section of Oriental Antiquities and Religious Ceremonials, Dr. Cyrus Adler writes:
This section comprises a small collection, interesting not so much because of the intrinsic value of the objects as because of the relation in which they are shown. It may be divided, according to religions and nations, into nine sections: (1) Biblico-Judaic, (2) Christian, (3) Mohammedan, (4) Egyptian, (5) Assyro-Babylonian, (6) Hittite, (7) Greeo-Roman, (8) Brahman, (9) Buddhist.
Of the Biblico-Judaic section, the collection of manuscripts and editions of the Bible and its versions (forty-one in number) may be considered as the most important, having both a literary and paleographic interest. Next to this may be mentioned the collection of objects of Jewish ceremonials, which, besides being a complete set of the objects used by the Jews in their religious observances, is of much artistic and historical value.
In the Egyptian section the mummy with its cases and the facsimile of the “ Book of the Dead” ranks foremost. In the Assyro-Babylonian section the most imposing objects are the two colossal composite figures and the model of a temple tower of Babel, the latter being unique. For purposes of the study of the mythology and culture of Mesopotamia, the collection of seals (upwards of 300 in number) is important.
The whole collection of Hittite casts (thirty-eight) is unique in America, and affords a basis for the study of the history and civilization of this people, who played such an important part in the ancient history of the Orient. _
In the Greco-Roman division rank foremost the Serpent Column of Delphi and the reliefs of the pedestal of the Obelisk, both from the Hippodrome in Constantinople. These casts are unique.
In the Buddhist section there are some fine images of Buddha of carved wood and bronze, models of pagodas from Japan, and a rare collection of musical instruments as well as other religious implements from China.
A rare piece of mosaic, representing a lion attacking a horse, from an ancient temple in Carthage, also deserves especial mention.
The varied collections grouped together in the Department of Arts and Industries are not readily summarized, but the following statements of those having the most important series in charge will be of interest:
In the section of historical collections are exhibited personal relics of representative men and memorials of events and places of historic importance. The nucleus of the collection was the Washington relics transferred from the Patent Office in 1883, and these still comprise the choicest of the historical treasures, including, as they do, so many objects intimately associated with General Washington during his home life, as well as military campaigns. Furniture, porcelain, glassware, and ornamental articles from Mount Vernon, Royal Worcester vases presented to him by Samuel Vaughan, the Martha Washington china, presented by Van Braam, a beautiful Niederweiler bowl, personally presented in 1792 by the Comte de Custine, and a nearly complete dinner service of Chinese ware decorated with the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati; and besides these, the tents, camp chest, field glass, and writing case used by Wash

<<<Page: 351>>>

ington during the War of the Revolution, as also miniature portraits of the General and Martha Washington painted on wood by the artist Trumbull.
Next in importance to the Washington relics are the almost priceless memorials of General Grant—the saddle, sword, field glasses, and other objects used by him during his military career; all his commissions in the Army, from lieutenant by brevet during the Mexican war up through the several grades to general, and his certificate as President of the United States; handsomely mounted swords; and the great gold medal with which he was honored by Congress for his military services; many elegant gifts received during his tour of the world, including the beautiful jade vase and ornamented bell standard given him by Prince Kung, of China.
By the side of these treasures are valuable gifts to Presidents of the United States and to statesmen, soldiers, and other representative Americans ; some Moorish guns, highly decorated with gold and coral, and a gold-mounted sword, gifts to Thomas Jefferson from the Emperor of Morocco; jeweled and gold-scabbard swords presented by citizens of States and cities for military bravery to General Ripley, Commodores Elliott and Biddle, Admiral Trenchard, Generals Hancock, Paul, and others.
Here, too, are exhibited the great gold medal presented by Congress to Joseph Francis for his service to the world as inventor of life-saving appliances; the beautiful vase presented to Professor Baird by the Emperor of Germany as the grand prize of the Berlin International Fishery Exhibition; the silver urn from the citizens of Baltimore to Commodore John Rodgers for his services io defense of that city during the war of 1812; the garrison flag of Fort Moultrie in December, i860, when that fort was evacuated by Anderson; the war saddle of Baron De Kalb, who gave his life for American independence; the uniform worn by General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans, and many other individual objects of great historic value.
A most instructive historic treasure is the Copp collection of household objects and wearing apparel, illustrating the home life of the New England colonists from 1635 to the period of the war of the Revolution, the gift of Mr. John Brenton Copp.
As a precious treasure in memory of the immortal Lincoln, there is the original plaster life-mask. Mqually interesting are the molds of the hands made by the sculptor Volk, in 1860, just prior to the nomination of Lincoln for President of the United States.
As a most conspicuous object, and a treasure as well, may be mentioned the original full-sized plaster model of Liberty by Crawford, from which was cast the bronze statue surmounting the United States Capitol.
Of the sections of Transportation, Engineering, and Naval Architecture and Physical Apparatus, Mr. J. E. Watkins, curator, writes as follows:
The collections in transportation, engineering, and naval architecture, although not great in extent, are particularly valuable on account of the historical interest of almost every object which has been collected and is now on exhibition. Notable among the objects is the cylinder of the first steam engine erected on the Western Continent, by Josiah Hornblower, in 1753, sixteen years before James Watt began his investigations of the properties of steam. The Museum has also been fortunate in obtaining the original machinery of the Stevens twin-screw propeller steamboat, constructed and operated in the year 1804, three years before Robert Fulton operated the Clermont on the Hudson River. The original multitubular boiler of the Stevens locomotive of 1825, which ran in Hoboken, N. J., four years before Stephenson’s Rocket, also forms a part of this collection. A cylinder and other portions of the locomotive ‘‘ Stourbridge Lion,” the first locomotive built for traffic on the Western Centinent, was obtained several years ago through the cooperation of Horatio Allen, who, in August, 1829, first ran this locomotive near Honesdale, Pa. The series showing the development of permanent way in America is unique, as is the

<<<Page: 352>>>

two collections of models showing the development of wheel vehicles and machinery of the steamboats invented by Rumsey, Fitch, Fulton, and Ericsson.
The Ramsden dividing engine, used in the last century to divide equally the circles of quadrants and other mathematical instruments, which is the earliest machine of this kind extant, also forms a part of the collection of apparatus. A very important and valuable recent addition to this section is the seismological apparatus, displayed at the World’s Columbian Exposition in the Japanese exhibit, and since presented to the Museum by that Government.
The electrical collections contain objects of extreme importance and value. Among these may be mentioned one of the first three large horseshoe electric magnets, wound and experimented with by Henry, together with the battery, first motor, and other similar appliances constructed by Henry while in Princeton; and the original telegraph apparatus invented by Professor Morse. The original telegraph instrument from which was received the historic message, ‘‘ What hath God wrought,” in Baltimore, 1844, also forms part of this collection, together with objects illustrating the beginnings and development of the storage battery and electric incandescent and are lamps, and other electrical apparatus.
The telephone which Johann Philipp Reis, of Frankfort, invented in 1860 is another object of much interest and value.
The collection of materia medica is probably the most complete and most carefully labeled collection of its kind exhibited in any museum. It is very full in many directions, and is especially rich in specimens of cinchona. Of the latter series Dr. J. M. Flint, U. 8. N., the honorary curator, writes:
IT regard the collection of cinchona products as the most important in the Materia Medica Section. This collection embraces specimens of nearly all the natural cinchona barks of South America, every variety of the cultivated product from the Government plantations in India, together with most of the cultivated sorts from Java, Ceylon, Jamaica, and Mexico. The India and Jamaica collections comprise also herbarium specimens of the leaf and flower, and in many cases the fruit of each variety of cinchona tree from which the bark is taken.
Of the section of Graphic Arts, Mr. S. R. Koehler writes:
This section was definitely organized in January, 1887, although its beginning goes back to at least the year 1884. From a very few specimens then on hand the collections in this section have increased to the number of 5,620 specimens at the present writing, but as many of the entries on the catalogue cover more than one specimen, it will be safe to say that the total number is about 6,000.
The aim of the section is to illustrate the various processes of making pictures by lines and masses, either black or in colors, by hand, or with the aid of machinery, and the application of these processes in the industrial arts. To reach this aim, all the methods of making pictures that have ever been essayed are eventually to be illustrated—and many of them are already illustrated—by the tools and materials used, by the product in the various stages of progress, and by historical examples showing the development of each process, from the invention to the present time.
In addition to the collections already noticed, the Museum possesses a good series of musical instruments, assembled under the immediate direction of Dr. Goode; a collection of porcelains, bronzes, and ivory carvings; a large and varied collection illustrating fisheries, which was brought together chiefly in connection with the Fisheries Exhibition of Berlin and London; a small forestry collection; a collection of foods; a collection representing the utilization of industrial products

<<<Page: 353>>>

derived from animals; a collection of fibers and textiles; and a series of objects illustrating the chemical composition of the human body.
I have already alluded to the work done by the Museum in the direetion of supplying from its surplus the needs of other scientific and educational establishments.
This undertaking was inaugurated at an early date, as I have stated on a preceding page (p. 297), and already in 1866, at the end of the second decade of the Institution, 110,000 specimens from the collections had been distributed. At the close of the fifth decade, in 1896, the number had risen to 521,000 specimens. These included animals of every class and many geological and mineralogical specimens and plants.
Every State and Territory in the Union has received a share of these collections, and numerous institutions outside the United States have also been beneficiaries in the distribution.
The majority of these specimens were distributed without demand for or expectation of a return; but the National Museum has received from other institutions in exchange for the collections sent out a body of specimens amounting in all to perhaps one-third the number distributed. Important additions have been made to the Museum in this way, and, indeed, its surplus collections, owing to the comparatively small amounts available for purchases, have constituted its chief capital. The system of exchanges, however, has its limitations, which are soon felt. Few institutions carry large quantities of surplus material, and none, of course, dispose of their most precious possessions. Exchange, therefore, takes the place of purchase only to a limited extent.
The Smithsonian Institution has carried on the distribution of surplus specimens from its own collections as a part of its regular activities having for their object the diffusion of knowledge. The Government has shown its acquiescence in this policy, so far as the national colleetions are concerned, by several enactments making appropriations for the work and in other ways.
In 1878 the Museum began the publication of a scientific journal, which has become well known to the world of science under the name of ‘Proceedings of the United States National Museum.” The object of this journal, as indicated in the “advertisement” inserted in the volumes, is “the prompt publication of freshly acquired facts relating to biology, anthropology, and geology; descriptions of restricted groups of animals and plants; the settlement of particular questions relative to the Synonymy of species, and the diaries of minor expeditions.” Kighteen volumes had been published to the close of 1895, containing in all no fewer than 1,100 papers, comprising 12,056 printed pages. All the papers relate directly or indirectly to the collections of the Museum and serve to make them known to specialists. The volumes include! a large
‘With the “ Bulletins” to be mentioned presently.

<<<Page: 354>>>

share of the scientific publications of the curators of the Museum, whose investigations have very naturally been based for the most part on the collections under their care. The “ Proceedings” is a great storehouse of facts relating to natural history, and especially in the field of systematic zoloogy, but the work of every department of the Museum is reflected in its pages.
A few years before the establishment of the ‘‘ Proceedings,” in 1875, the Museum began the publication of a series of monographic works, under the general title of the ‘ Bulletin of the United States National Museum,” whichin 1895 had reached 49 numbers. This series does not differ essentially in character from the ‘“ Proceedings,” but comprises for the most part works too large to be conveniently included in the latter journal and generally of a more comprehensive scope.
The regular series of both ‘ Proceedings” and “ Bulletin” are in octavo, but the Museum has also published three numbers of the latter series, aS “Special Bulletins,” in quarto. Two of these contain “ Life Histories of North American Birds, with special reference to their breeding habits and eggs,” by Major Bendire, and the third, a treatise on ‘Oceanic Ichthyology,” by Dr. Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean.
The report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution until 1884 consisted each year of a single volume in which was included a statement of the operations of the National Museum. The report of 1884, however, and those of subsequent years have been published in two volumes, of which one is devoted exclusively to a statement of the work of the Museum. In connection with the administrative reports contained in these volumes has been published a series of illustrated papers of a nontechnical character descriptive of various collections in the Museum. These papers have the same interest for nonprofessional readers that the technical papers in the “ Proceedings” have for investigators, and the demand for them reveals a widespread interest in zoology, botany, anthropology, and those other subjects with which the work of the Museum has been most closely connected..:

By THOMAS WILSON,
Curator, Division of Prehistoric Archwology, U. S. National Museum.
Art and science have, in these later days, come to be closely connected. Artists of all countries and periods are conditioned by the circumstances in which their lives are passed, and by the ideas prevalent among their peoples. Thus Art history becomes a function of social history, and can not wisely be disregarded by the student of the history of the human race. Ancient works of art bring us into contact with bygone peoples, and are often the only avenue whereby we can approach far-distant civilizations lying silent on the verge of time. Thus the study of Art history becomes a branch of Scientific inquiry. It has to be pursued by Scientific methods. Its results are of Scientific importance. It is a chapter, and perhaps the most pregnant chapter, of the Science of (Prehistoric) Anthropology, which seems destined in the near future to no insignificant growth. (Conway: “Art and Science.”’)
Art is the manifestation of human emotion externally interpreted by expressive arrangements of line, form, or color, or by a series of gestures, sounds, or words, governed by particular rhythmical cadences.!
Art is the harmonious expression of human emotion.’
These definitions are general, and include all kinds of art. Emotions, whether grave or gay, are thus manifested or interpreted; when by color, the art is painting; when by line, drawing or engraving; when by form, sculpture; and a combination of these may produce architecture. When the emotion is manifested by gesture or rhythmic movement it produces the dance; when by rhythmic notes, musie; when by rhythmic words, poetry. These are the exterior sigus by which the human emotions are manifested.
Each art is the peculiar language of a more or less extensive category of ideas and sentiments, to which it alone is able to give adequate expression.
Certain of the arts appeal to the brain through the organ 0 sivht— painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture, and the dance; while certain others appeal through the organs of hearing—poetry, music, and

the drama. In the former group, action is arrested and the representation is confined to a single moment of time; in the latter, the action is continuous.
But the laws governing both groups are the same. Their success requires concord and harmony between the external vibrations and the nerves which convey the impressions to the nerve centers.
A work of art is a material expression of its maker’s delight. It excites the nerve centers and produces the sensations of delight or pleasure. We see or hear the artist’s ideal through his work, and the success of his effort as a work of art depends, first, upon the brilliancy and clearness of his perception of his ideal, and, second, on his ability to translate and render this perception correctly. A copy, however accurate, even of the most beautiful scenes in nature, is not art. No artist can hope to equal the faithfulness of the photograph in reproduction, yet this is only the art of photography. A work of art is the ideal of the artist. It is his own thought; is a part of himself. Not nature as it actually is, but as he sees it, as he idealizes and then depicts it. It is this presentation of the ideality of artistic genius, whether in picture, statue, poem, music, the dance, in architecture, or what not, that stamps the work as one of art, and herein it differs from amere mechanical copy, however accurate. Itis this ideality of artistic genius which produces the sensation of delight.
Art is susceptible of several divisions. The commonest division is into fine, decorative, and industrial. It is not the intention of this paper to treat of industrial art per se. Fine art deals with painting, drawing, engraving, sculpture, architecture, music, poetry, and the drama. <A division into prehistoric fine art may be made according to the material employed. Prehistoric decorative art explains itself.
The word “art” has different significations, according as it is used in the singular or plural form. When used in the singular form it relates to fine art; when in the plural, to industrial art. This linguistic distinction is continued in the designation of the workman; the one is an artist, the other an artisan. Sculpture in marble is undoubtedly a fine art, and the sculptor is an artist. Suppose his marble sculpturing is used for a magnificent chimney front in one of the mediweval chateaux of Europe, or his sculpturing in wood is used for a piece of furniture. It may then be either fine or industrial art, the line between them being extremely difficult to trace. The test of utility does not satisfy the conditions. Raphael’s celebrated cartoons were designed for tapestries; Rubens made designs for similar purposes. Many recognized artists devote their best talents to making decorative designs for furniture, textiles, pottery, wall papers, book covers, and binding; while others equally well recognized find regular employment in illustrating our magazines and books; yet these are all industrial arts.
No attempt will be made to maintain the distinction between fine arts and industrial arts, nor to determine where the work of the artist

<<<Page: 383>>>

leaves off or that of the artisan begins. The work of the artisan is often quite as difficult to perform as that of the artist. It affords him as much pleasure; he takes as much pride in it, and puts as much sentiment into it, as does the artist. Nor can the test of utility be better applied, for some of the fine arts are highly utilitarian, while some of the industrial arts may be the reverse. If utility is to be the test, the lace maker, whether of point or bobbin laces, should be classed as an artist, for her work is always ornamental in contradistinction from utilitarian. It is only by this test that the sardine fish nets of western France are not to be classed as lace.
The idea sought to be presented is the extreme difficulty in distinguishing fine art from industrial art, the artist from the artisan; and the reader of the following pages is asked not to be critical in the author’s application of the word ‘‘art.”
Not infrequently a piece of work begins in industrial art and ends in fine art. The decorations in the Congressional Library building in Washington are examples. Much of the work began with the stonecutter and was finished by the sculptor; much of the wall decoration must have begun with the whitewasher and ended with an aggregation of the best artist painters in the country. The mosaic work also ran the entire gamut of art. So it may bein many of the arts mentioned in this book. The work may have begun with the rudest mechanism, as in flint chipping, and ended in specimens of great beauty, requiring the highest skill, representing sentiment or imagination, being purely ornamental, without utility, and intended to satisfy an wsthetic demand. In these the dividing line between fine art and industrial art is not attempted to be maintained, nor is this at all necessary. A manifestation of a high order of industrial art by prehistoric man comes equally within the scope of this paper as though it were recognized fine art.
Sir John Collier, in his ‘Primer of Art,” says that decorative art is the making of something to please the eye, but as to what is pleasing, that each person must decide for himself. With this definition for a basis, about all we can say is that the objects made by the prehistoric man pleased him and he desired them. All beyond is mere theory—at least is to be referred to psychology for an answer. To answer why he desired these objects to be beautiful in addition to their being ultilitarian would be only speculation on our part.
Professor Haddon, in his work on ‘ Evolution in Art,” says that the most satisfactory method of procedure when dealing with difficult problems is to reduce them to their simplest elements and then investigate these simple elements before studying their more complex aspect. The author has proceeded along the lines of this advice. He has thus far taken not only a single people, but has taken them in a single locality, and has given all procurable evidence bearing on their art work, whether in its material or psychologic aspect. Through this we

are now in possession of all the information at present obtainable. Much more might be said of the man of the Paleolithic period in relation to his industry, his technology, possibly his sociology; bat on the subject of his art and art work it is believed that the present paper will be found exhaustive. It furnishes the foundation upon which theory and speculation may be built ad libitum, but it is believed that the foundation is laid as broadly and as deeply as it can be in the present condition of the world’s knowledge. What future discoveries may bring forth no one may venture to prophesy.
It is believed that these objects come within Sir John Collier’s definition. They were something to please the eye of the man who made them, and for this reason, and apparently only this, he made most of them. What should have pleased him is (still quoting Sir John Collier) ‘what each person must decide for himself,’ and this man of the Paleolithic period appears to have decided that question in favor of these objects, and in accordance with that canon of his art he made the objects herein to be set forth.
Other aspects of art have been studied and written about by artists and historians from time immemorial. . Their consideration opeus a field for discussion into which we may not enter. We must content ourselves with this, which appears to be the very beginning of art.
The craving for decorative art and the desire for things beautiful are the common heritage of mankind. Former writeis have speculated upon the origin of this craving and have believed it to be contemporaneous with the origin of art, and that they have declared to be as impossible of discovery as the origin of the attraction of gravitation. In this they have deceived themselves and have overstated the case, for it is respectfully submitted that in the following chapters the author has shown the beginnings of art, its earliest specimens, and by related specimens from the earliest people and their descendants confined to a single locality, given a comprehensive exhibition of the objects made, and the styles employed for their decoration; and this carries us back practically to the origin of art. No art objects earlier than these described here are known to have existed in any part of the world.
Professor Haddon! speaks of the needs of man which have conStrained him to an artistic effort, and which he groups under the four terms of art, information, wealth, and religion. A‘sthetic art he defines to be the study or practice of art for art’s sake, the pleasure of form, line, and color. Omitting color, it is believed that the illustrations of prehistoric art shown in this paper come fairly within this definition. The objects figured and described show art work done for art’s sake, to the end that the maker may obtain sensuous pleasure from form and line. Not only is it this, but it appears to be nothing else. All other terms of the group may be omitted so far as concerns the art work of this epoch. Man did not do this work for the sake of
1Evolution of Art, p. 4.

<<<Page: 385>>>

religion for, so far as can be understood, he had no religion, nor did he make these things for the sake of power or wealth. It does not appear that he considered himself in any way better off by having these objects decorated than he would if they had been plain. There are many hundreds of them which are entirely plain, of equal value for service, evidently utilitarian, without ornament or decoration, and apparently serving as weapons of the chase or war equally well with those highly decorated. Therefore these objects, beautifully designed as they may have been, were no addition to his wealth or his power, and as for information he was not busying himself about that. He gained information, it is true, by experience and his own effort, as he and every other human being did and will, but this wrought his own education and was not for the purpose of educating those around him. So this branch of the story ends where it began; he made these things because they were pleasing to him, and he (each man) decided for himself what was pleasing. These works of art were the material expression of the delight of their maker. The man of the Paleolithic period, savage though he was, had his ideal. The existence of these art works, the representation of the animals which he saw, of the plants and flowers which he must have recognized as beautiful, the existence of these in the caverns which he inhabited, and part of the possessions fabricated by him; their mere existence proves the fact of his ideality, proves that he had a taste and a desire, and are evidence of his gratification thereof. What other ideals he may have had we do not know; he has left no manifestation thereof. So far as we know man his tastes are continually changing, but whether the man of the Paleolithic period changed his tastes or not is not now determinable except so far as shown by his works, first of flint and then of bone, and finally of engraving and sculpture. It is only by these that we may know what were his tastes and what their changes.
Man does whatever art work he desires. The outcome of his work is an expression of his ideal of beauty, of happiness, of goodness, of justice, and what not. When his taste or desire changes, his ideal changes, and with it his work. Everything that man does is done because he wants it to be done; it is his ideal. Human life is only a succession of ideals. The fashion in dress of the present day, why does it change? Why is the ideal of one season discarded the next? A change of taste is the only explanation. What produces this change? ‘Aye, there’s the rub.” Taste may be produced and may be changed by study and contemplation. Man is an imitative creature; he is gregarious; he loves to herd with his kind, to follow a leader, to be relieved from the necessity of study or contemplation of the needs of his life; he prefers to follow in the footsteps of his forefathers and the rut or route of civilization and culture which they have marked out for him. It is only occasionally, once in a generation, that some one being with a more energetic or ambitious desire or a greater
NAT MUS 96 2a

<<<Page: 386>>>

harmonizing power, greater analysis, higher judgment, better intellect, becomes a leader of those about him and out of his judgment or through his study or experience he discovers or develops new ideals and so changes the standards of taste and beauty for his generation. But there seems to have been practically no change of the ideals of the Paleolithic man in the center of France. So the flint chipping and bone polishing, while they might have been steps of evolution in man’s progress, at last ended in the art objects presented in the first chapters.
The discussion of these abstruse, unknown, psychological questions is not here attempted, though the facts presented are pregnant with suggestions, which can not be here considered, as to the causes which impelled the wild hairy savage of Paleolithic times to produce these art works. We ask ourselves which of his tastes were gratified, which of his longings after. the beautiful were satisfied, what folds of the brain or what parts of his nervous system were set into harmonious action, and why and how did the making of these designs produce pleasure in him as he made them, or how did they gratify him when he possessed them?
An examination of these questions would be aside from the author’s intention and beyond his powers. He has no desire to enter into a philosophic, metaphysic, or psychologic discussion as to the origin of the art instinct in man or its evolution in his mind. This paper is a contribution to the history of art rather than to the science of art, and is intended as arecord of the actual manifestations of art in the various epochs of human culture in prehistoric times, showing the earliest specimens, and thus presenting the idea indicated by the title “‘ Prehistoric Art, or the Origin of Art as Manifested in the Works of Prehistoric Man.” i
The term “prehistoric” is used in this paper in the ordinary and usual sense, as being prior to history, before the beginning of history, meaning of course human history. As history can be only in writing, this means before written history. Prehistoric science does not depend on historical records made contemporaneous with the happening of the events recorded; it is based upon the evidence of the objects themselves. The discovery of these objects and the birth of the science of prehistoric anthropology lie within the present century. Prehistoric anthropologists have investigated these objects and the various deposits containing them as to (1) their human origin, (2) the geologic age of the stratum in which they are found, (3) their original deposit in that Stratum at the time it was formed (that is to say, an absence of intrusion or disturbance), (4) the association and superposition of the implements and objects in the stratified deposits; and by the knowledge and experience thus obtained they have determined that man made these objects and, therefore, he existed in these localities in times of high antiquity.
This paper deals with the art of making and decorating these objects.

<<<Page: 387>>>

Not infrequently theories are advanced as to certain natural artistic manifestations of the human mind. Objections are made to arguments of contact between peoples arising from similarities of objects of art, industry, or decoration.
Mr. A. R. Wallace, speaking of the supposed migrations of the Swastika, says the cross made with two sticks, laid at right angles, would be the easiest, the most natural, and therefore the most likely sign to have been made first by primitive man.
We hear of the cosmic circle, the solar circle, the magic square, ete., as the “foundations of our original conception of the infinite.” The sacred wheel of the law is spoken of as ‘“‘common to all ancient cosmogonies invented for the world and all time. * * * The Ainead of spiritual principles, with their eternal relationships definitely determined by the sacred wheel, have been the inspiration,” ete.
The attention of these and similar theorists is called to the fact that we have traced these art manifestations through three great epochs of prehistoric culture; that we have seen styles and designs of decoration without number, and we have to remark the absence of the cross, the circle, and the wheel. The Swastika made its appearance during the bronze age. It seems to have been the earliest known symbol! and was probably related to the cross, but except this, though the styles of decoration were principally geometric and made of dots and lines, the fundamental geometric forms of cross, circle, and wheel are not found.
The earliest manifestations of human art consisted of the chipping of implements of flint, practically the first known to have been made or used by man. They belong to the Paleolithic period of the Stone Age.

>This is sometimes called “flaking,” and perhaps with equal right. My preference is for the term ‘‘chipping,” if for no other reason than because it is in more common and greater use. A distinction can be made between the two terms, between the objects which are obtained and the processes by which it is accomplished, though usually no such distinction is made. Webster in his definition of—
‘Flake, n.,” speaks of ‘‘(1) small collection of snow, (2) a platform of hurdles, (3) a layer or stratum,” but nothing relating to the present question.
“Wake, v. t., to form into flakes.
“Flake, v. i., to break or separate into layers, to peel or scale off.” We more usually say ‘‘to flake off.”
The Standard Dictionary gives—
“Flake, n. 1. A sinall flat fragment or loosely cohering mass; a thin piece or chip of anything; scale; fleck.”
According to Webster, the words “flake” or “ flaking” have no reference either to the thing or process involved in this discussion. He says:
“Chip, n. (1) A piece of wood or other substance separated from a body by a cutting instrument, particularly by an axe. It is used also for a piece of stone sepa

This period has been divided according to progress in human culture, and divers names have been given thereto, following the taste of the writers or discoverers. M. Lartet named the epochs after the animals associated with the implements and called them, respectively, the epochs of the Cave Bear, the Mammoth, and the Reindeer. M. Dupont, of Belgium, divided it into only two, and named the epochs after the Mammoth and the Reindeer. M.de Mortillet has divided it into five epochs, and has named them, respectively, the Chelléen, after the station of Chelles, a few miles east of Paris; the Acheuléen, after St. Acheul on the river Somme; the Mousterien, after the caverns of Moustier on the river Vézcre, Dordogne; the Solutréen, after the rock shelter of Solutré near Macon; and the Madelainien, after the rock shelter of La Madelaine, Dordogne.
In later days the tendency seems to be to divide them otherwise. M. Cartailhac and M. Reinach, following Sir John Evans, are in favor of the first period being called the alluvium, and the second the cavern. All authorities are, however, unanimous in their agreement that this period and all these epochs, whatever they are to be called, belong to the Quaternary geologic period; that they were earlier than the
rated by a chisel or other instrument in hewing. (2) A fragment or piece broken off; a small piece.
“Chip, v. t. To cut into small pieces or chips, to diminish by cutting away a little at a time, or in small pieces.
“Chip, v. i. To break or fly off in small pieces.”
The Standard Dictionary says:
“‘Chip,n. 1. Asmall piece cut or broken off. (1) Asmall thin or flattish piece of wood or stone cut or chopped out. (2) A small fragment with at least one featheredge, broken off from any hard or brittle body; spall.”
According to the author’s opinion, the definitions and differences are as follows:
A flake is that object which, of flint, is struck always by a blow, from a core or nucleus in large and usually long and thin pieces. The process by which this is made may be called ‘‘flaking.” It is, or ought to be, confined to the single blow by which the flake is stricken off.
Chipping comprises all other methods of striking off pieces of flint. It may be used for preparing the nucleus, or for transforming the flake or other material or object into the implement desired.
The fine handiwork done on many, and, indeed, most, of the flint implements described in this paper, has been done by chipping and can not be regarded in any proper sense as that of flaking. The infinitesimal chips by which the deep notches, the fine points, the serrated edges, of spear and arrow-heads, by which the herringbone handles of Scandinavian daggers and the broad and thin leaf-shaped implements are and have been made, and indeed by which all finely finished and delicately worked flint implements have been brought to their present condition, can not, with any degree of propriety, be called flaking, but should be called chipping. The pieces striken from these objects by the processes to which they have been submitted can not, without violence to the sense, be called flakes. It appears to the author much more proper to call them chips.
He is well aware that the implement of beaver’s tooth used by the Eskimo has been called ‘‘the flaker,” but this was only the determination or name given by its discoverer and has no other value than that of his opinion. The pieces pressed off with this implement are chips, and not flakes.

present geologic period, and that they came to an end before its beginning. The most certain, and therefore the most satisfactory, division has been that of M. de Mortillet, named after the various localities where the respective implements have been found in their ereatest purity. I give my preference to it, subject to the correction incident to further discovery, if for no other reason, because it is more convenient. The names given are for localities, and consequently are purely arbitrary. They may not, perhaps, serve for general terms over the world, but within their own locality they have a definite and certain meaning; while to say the epoch of alluvium, the epoch of caverns, the epoch of the drift, or of the mammoth, bear, reindeer, etc., might have an application in other countries which would deceive the reader. The names Chelléen, Mousterien, etc., have no such application, and can not be applied to other countries. They indicate and describe only one kind of implement and one stage of culture, and, as definitions, they are exact. If other countries have other things to be described, if different epochs are found, then other names may have to be given; but when we speak now of these epochs, the Chelléen, Mousterien, ete., and the implements that belong to them, the speaker and hearer are on a common ground, and both use the terms in the same sense.
These epochs seem to have brought forth the earliest examples of esthetic art. The man of this time has passed for a savage, and he doubtless was one. He had no tribal organizations, no sociology, no belief in a future state, no religion; he did not bury his dead, he erected no monuments, he built no houses; he was a hunter and fisher, he had no local habitation, dwelt in no villages except such as could be so called from a number of people living in a cavern for the purpose of shelter. Yet he occupied, in the Solutréen epoch, the highest rank as a flint chipper, and in the Madelainien epoch the highest place as an engraver on bone and ivory. His materials were the bones, horns, and tusks of the animals he killed. His tools or implements were sharply worked points or gravers of flint. Most of the specimens of art work are found in caves which had been his habitations. No one has sufficient knowledge to justify the declaration that all specimens of this art work belong to western Europe, but certain it is that most of the known specimens have been from that country. They are found chiefly in the caverns of central and southern France, and while about 400 specimens have been found and preserved, no one knows how many have been missed or remain undiscovered. The specimens found in caverns were originally thrown aside and lost in the débris, and have been protected by stalagmitic or other processes of induration. In making these excavations there is nothing to guide the searcher to the places where these are likely to be found. He must depend on his experience or good fortune. The specimens are usually enveloped in blocks or slabs, which by infiltration and induration became hardened, and must be quarried almost like stone. In bringing these blocks or

<<<Page: 390>>>

slabs to the surface or light many specimens are necessarily broken and lost and many others in the interior of the block or slab are never ‘discovered. It is, of course, not known what number are lost in this, or, indeed, in any way, but the specimens being scattered throughout the mass with nothing to indicate their whereabouts, it would be strange if such was not the case. Specimens of these slabs or layers can be shown which would not only explain but demonstrate the truth of these assertions.
Plate 1 is a representation of a portion of the indurated floor of the cavern of Les Eyzies, and is taken from a specimen in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 9106),
A few specimens of the art work of the Paleolithic period are purely decorative and without attempt to make representation of anything, but for the most part the objects were the animals of the period and lovality. Many animals now extinct were represented, and in this way knowledge of their appearance has been preserved. The animals most frequently engraved were the mammoth, cave bear, Irish elk, musk ox, reindeer, chamois, mountain goat, urus or aurochs, horse, deer, and similar animals, and finally man. The marine animals were well represented—the seal,.sea lion, tortoise, turtle, fishes, and serpents. Some of the objects thus treated were purely ornamental, while others were utilitarian; batons de commandement, poniard or dagger handles, and similar specimens were for utility, while other specimens were apparently intended as playthings. Many of them are so broken as to afford no clue to their purpose. This was the art of the Paleolithic period. That of the succeeding periods, the Neolithic and Bronze ages, was of a different style. It was almost entirely decorative and was etched or cut on pottery and bronze objects of utility. During this period there was ouly the slightest attempt on the part of the artists to represent living or material objects. The decorative art of that period consisted mostly of designs in geometric forms, as squares, circles, lozenges, chevrons, herringbones, zigzags, and crosshatch. Dr. Schliemann thought he found, upon some of the objects found in the Third City of Troy, representations of burning altars and occasional rude representations of animals like the hare. The Swastika seems to have been used throughout the latter period, and is believed to have been a symbol representing good luck, good fortune, long life, much happiness, ete., and to have been the first and earliest symbol in use among men.
These periods (Neolithic and Bronze) brought an entire change in the culture of man as well as in his art. He became sedentary, having a local habitation and place of residence. He became an agriculturist as well as a hunter and fisher; had a religion—at least he buried his dead as though in recognition of a future state. He built houses, constructed forts and fortresses; he built tumuli, mounds, and dolmens, and erected great stone obelisks, sometimes in groups and lines, which,

for want of a better name, are called alignments. He acquired the art of and became an adept in chipping, grinding, polishing, and drilling stone, especially the hard flint and tough jade, of which he left some magnificently wrought specimens. A few whistles have been found belonging to the Paleolithic period, but the greater proportion of them belong to the Neolithic period and Bronze age. The American Indian and his congeners, those on the West Indian Islands or Antilles, were in the Neolithic stage of culture and their decorative art was practically the same as of that age in Europe. They excelled their European brethren, however, in making rude drawings and pictures, principally petroglyphs, many of them, doubtless, ideographs, telling a story by their description. They often reproduce the human figure, which the European rarely did, The aborigines of Mexico, Central, and the northwestern part of South America, although still in the Stone age, reached a higher civilization, mainly manifested by their fine sculpturing of stone, the erection of extensive and magnificent temples, and their ideographic language.
No theory will be propounded in this paper, the only intention being to present facts on which arguments can be made and theories built. The sociology of the prehistoric man will not be essayed, and no a priort arguments will be introduced to explain the psychology of prehistoric man, nor will any philosophic treatise be attempted, giving pretended explanations of the causes which impelled aboriginal man to indulge in essays at «esthetic art other than the requirements of his condition or the suggestion of his fancy. To do this would be to substitute theory for fact.
The present paper will be devoted to Prehistoric art, and will not deal with Prehistoric anthropology. That subject is left to other works, a list of the principal of which is given in the author’s Handbook,! published in the Report of the United States National Museum of 1887-88. ;
The Paleolithic period, the earliest epoch of the Stone age, obtained its highest known development in western Europe, possibly because it has been more profoundly studied there than elsewhere. By common consent it has there been subdivided into epochs according to the degrees of art manifested. Different names have been given to these epochs, and while there has been some dispute about details, the main proposition of a Paleolithic period earlier than the Neolithic has been accepted by all.
The peculiar characteristic of the implements of the Paleolithic period is that man’s cutting implements, usually of stone, preferably flint, were always made by chipping. In the later epochs of the Paleolithic period certain implements were made of bone and horn, which were ground or smoothed, while those of stone were not. It is not, however, to be supposed that every chipped stone implement. belonged to the

Paleolithic period, for the prehistoric man of the Neolithic period chipped many implements of stone. All implements of flint, whether Paleolithic or Neolithic, were made partly or wholly by chipping. Arrow and spear heads, knives, serapers, drills, perforators, and such, of whatever age, period, or epoch, when of flint, were made wholly by chipping, while many implements of stone made by grinding or polishing were first prepared by chipping or hammering. It is, therefore, proper that a paper on Prehistoric art should begin with flint chipping.
The beginning of flint chipping is found in the flint implements of the Chelléen epoch, called by some persons in Europe the Alluvial, by others the Cave Bear period.
M. de Mortillet, in his subdivision of the Paleolithic period, names this the Chelléen epoch after the station of Chelles (Plate 2), in the valley of the River Marne, a few miles east of Paris. This station was

chosen as representative because the implements were there found in their greatest purity, though not in their greatest number. These have in England been called drift implements because they have been found principally in the river drifts or deposits. Their original position indicates the same antiquity as the gravel deposits themselves.
There was a time when the water of the rivers filled the valleys from hill to hill, pouring down with a rush its irresistible current, eroding the earth, and, if need be, the rock, to make for itself an outlet. As time progressed the water subsided and the current became less powerful. The sand and gravel which had before been carried out to the sea began to be deposited in this bend and on that point, until at last the deposit came to the surface of the water, and formed what is now the highest terrace. This narrowed the river and the terrace became a new river bank. This process was repeated again and again, until the river finally retreated to its present bed and left its terraces, sometimes

three in number, the first being higher, deeper, and more distant from the river than the others. These are now marks of the successive stages in the formation of the river valleys.
The gravelly deposit of the River Marne at Chelles forms the plain of the river valley. It is from 22 to 26 feet in thickness (Plate 2). The sand and gravel rests upon the original chalk and is about on a level with the highest floods of the river in modern times. These deposits are of different degrees of fineness and are laid in strata or layers, showing that they were made by the action of the water (fig. 1). The strata are not always continuous, and they differ in thickness and position, showing the water to have had varying currents. Large, erratic bowlders are found occasionally. The sand and gravel are sometimes intercalated with other strata, which show a change in the surrounding conditions. The most frequentof these is an irregular stratum of calcareous cement. In other places are pockets or strata containing various solutions of iron, the percolating water from which gives the color to the implements described, and sometimes forms the cement itself.
There has been much discussion over the time and manner of the formation of these river valleys and the deposit of their sand and gravel as bearing on their antiquity. Such a discussion is unnecessary here, but all disputants are agreed that implements of human industry are found in these river gravels in positions which indicate their deposit at the time of the original formation and at a distance from the river and depth below the surface which indicate their antiquity to be equal with the earliest deposits. Whether they were swept down from the springs which formed the head waters of the river, were dropped on the borders of the stream in the near neighborhood, or precisely in what manner they became involved with the sand and gravel in which they are now found, is not only unknown but there has not yet been any entirely satisfactory theory developed.
A series of these implements is presented, side and edge views, so that the student may understand the differences between these and the thinner leaf-shaped implements and spearheads of other periods and epochs, with which they are not to be confounded. These differences are vital, and as they can not be brought out by a side view alone, an edge view is deemed sometimes indispensable. Some of the implements from Chelles are extremely crude and rough and belong to a very primitive industry, yet they may not be omitted from a work on Prehistoric art.
The Chelléen implements figured represent the standards for this epoch. They are mostly oval, with a cutting edge at the point, contrary to those of the Neolithic period. The body of the implement is thick, after the shape of an almond or peach stone, and not thin and flat, as a laurel leaf, like those of a later epoch. They were of flint where that stone was obtainable; where it was not, quartz and quartzite seem to have been employed. The flint always broke under a blow

with a conchoidal fracture, and this may frequently be seen. Some specimens were made from bowlders, and in chipping to a cutting edge : or point the crust of the pebble was often left as a grip. Fig. 2 (Cat. No. 99440, U.S.N. M.) is one of these. It comes from the station of Thennes, in the river Arve, an affluent ofthe Somme, France. Ithas been finely chipped to a sharp cutting edge around one end. Fig. 3 (Cat. No. 11083, U.S.N. M.) represents one of the same type from Thetford, England. It shows the chalky erust for a grip, while the other end is chipped to a point, as though for digging rather than cutting. These pebbles both belong to the chalk formation, Fig. 2. : PALEOLITHIC CHELLEEN IMPLEMENT OF CHIPPED FLINT. as do most of the flints from From the River Arve, at the prehistoric station of these countries.

It is oval or almond-shaped, with the cutting edge at the point, but has been made of flint from a ledge, and not from a nodule or pebble. The entire surface, both sides and edges, has been worked by chipping, though the butt or grip is thicker and has its edges battered so that it can be better held in the hand. The hand may also have been protected against the sharp edges or corners by a bit of skin, fur, grass, or similar substance. It is doubted whether any of these implements were attached to a handle.

the form of which was the most difficult to successfully insert in a handle, To make a firm attachment of an implement of this form, the handle must

envelop it at its greatest diameter, and herein lies the first difficulty. If the sharpened implement be insufficiently inserted it will drop out; if only partially inserted a few hard blows would split the handle; if it be inserted too far the same blow will drive it through.
The particular or special use of the Chelléen implement is unknown, though it may easily be surmised. The wise men of Europe have made many guesses and suppositions, but beyond the suggestion of a cutting or digging implement adapting itself to varying daily needs of the aboriginal man, all these are naught but speculation. Many of the implements bear undoubted traces of use on their cutting edges. Sir John Evans, in his latest work, reverts to his first and original opinion, that ‘it is nearly useless to speculate as to the purposes to which they were applied.” Sir John Lubbock says:
Almost as well might we ask to what would they not be applied. Infinite as are our instruments, who would attempt, even at present, to say what was the use of a knife? But the primitive savage had no such choice of tools. We see before us, perhaps, the whole contents of his workshop, and with these weapons, rude as they seem to us, he may have cut down trees, scooped them out into canoes, grubbed up roots, killed animals and enemies, cut up his food, made holes in winter through the ice, prepared firewood, etc.
Attention is called to the relation of width to thickness of the specimens shown, especially in fig. 4, because this is a characteristic of Paleolithic types, and one of the recognizable differences between Chelléen and all other implements. This specimen is 3,; inches in width and 12 inches in thickness—or the thickness is 53 per cent of the width. The average Solutreen and Neolithic leaf-shaped implements of this width are about three-fourths of an inch, or 22 per cent of the width.
The flint of which these implements are made has, in many specimens, passed, since their manufacture, through certain chemical and physical changes on the surface. Some show a certain brillianey, in some the color has changed to red or yellow, and so on through the scale to chalky white. This change, called patina, is produced by contact with

the atmosphere or the earth, or with the water which has percolated through the earths in the neighborhood, generally those containing iron, and these have changed the chemical combination of the flint on its surface. This change sometimes extends deep into the stone, and in small specimens under favorable conditions may pass entirely through it.!. In the United States all this might be called weathering; in France it is called patine. The objection to the former word is that it conveys, possibly involuntarily, some relation to the weather, while the patine may be formed on specimens deep in the earth. Dendrites are also formed on the specimens. These changes are evidences of antiquity of the specimens, and to the experienced eye become _ testimonials of its genuineness. Fig. 5 (Cat. No. 99457, U.S. N.M.) represents a_ slightly different form. It is longer, narrower, thicker, and is more pointed. Its length is 64 inches, width 23 inches, and thickness 1{ inches, or 71 per cent. It comes from the forest of Othe, department of Aube or Yonne, eastern central France, and is one of the many surface finds of France. It has been strongly objected to similar specimens found in the United States that, being found practically on the surface, they are not evidence of a Paleolithic period; and the From the (surface) forest of Othe, eastern central force of this objection is adFrance. mitted. However, many such pee Ose gata ee aa implements have been found on the surface of the high plateaus of western Europe, and they have always been considered as true paleoliths. This question is not to be argued here; those interested in it are referred to the handbook? previously cited, where some of the instances are stated and authorities quoted. It has already been remarked that most of the Paleolithic implements from western Europe are of flint, but all are not so. An exten-

sive workshop for the manufacture of Paleolithic implements was found on or near the surface at Bois du Rocher not far from Dinan,
France, by MM. Micault and Fornier, of Rennes. The material was quartzite, and chips, flakes, hammer stones, and unfinished implements, with the usual debris, were found, and along with them a number of finished implements, of which fig. 6 (Cat.

Some of the prehistoric archeologists of France have sought to make a subdivision of the culture of the Chelléen epoch and to denominate the specimens from St. Acheul near Amiens on the Somme River, France, by the name of that station. These specimens are thinner, with smaller flakes; are finer in their manufacture, and show an improved art of flint chipping. Fig. 10 represents one of these specimens. It is of flint, pointed, almond-shaped, showing part of crust of pebble left for grip, and with cutting edge at the small end.

Implements in large numbers have been discovered in nearly every State of the United States, bearing great resemblance in form, appearance, and mode of manufacture to the Paleolithic (Chelléen and St. Acheuléen) implements from western Europe and the localities just mentioned. If accepted as such, their presence would prove the occupation of America by a prehistoric race of the same culture status.
The investigation concerning these implements has not been very profound, nor has it been settled to the satisfaction of all prehistoric archeologists, perhaps not even to a majority, that they are truly Paleolithic implements. There have been various contentions concerning this. On this subject the author has formulated his conclusions as follows:
It is apparent on slight inspection that these implements found in the United States, although mostly on the surface, are of the same Paleolithic type as those found in the gravels of Europe and elsewhere.

<<<Page: 403>>>

No attempt is made to define Paleolithic civilization or culture, nor to describe the man who made or employed these implements. These implements are not declared to be either glacial or preglacial, yet they have been found in glacial gravels, and they are decided to be different from the implement common to the Neolithic civilization of America. Thus they furnish a working hypothesis indicating a stage of Paleolithic culture in America. This conclusion is expressed under all reserve, and subject to future discoveries. As a working hypothesis, it may stimulate investigators to search in such gravels, fluvial or glacial, as may be sus; pected of containing them. This might induce investigators and collectors to gather and save them as valuable to science, to

In Europe, Pajeolithic man belonged to a past geologic age called there the Quaternary ; the objects of his industry were found associated with the remains of extinct animals usually fossilized, belonging to the aforesaid geologic epoch, and, therefore, if we are to find Paleolithic man in America in times of similar antiquity, we must call to our aid the science of

or his ancestor, the implements will surely be found sometime and somewhere; and then those who are now opposed will agree. If the implements are not found, then those now favoring will be compelled to give it up. In any event, the investigation should be made, and no adverse decision is justifiable while the question is pending.
It is not intended to make here any argument favoring a Paleolithic epoch in America, but only to note the similarity in the early prehistoric times in the art of flint chipping in Europe and other localities with the same art in America.

It has been contended that human occupation during the Cavern period in Europe was contemporaneous with the Glacial period, that the inhabitants had theretofore lived without particular habitations, and the climate being warm and moist, they were without particular need of any; but on the approach of cold, incident to glaciers, the inhabitauts retreated to the caverns for warmth and shelter.
It appears certain that there was at the beginning of this epoch a material change in human art and industry. The Chelléen and St. Acheuléen implements, so widespread, were superseded by objects now
found in the caves and rock shelters occupied by man. This statement might be doubted if it rested on a few objects, but its truth will be apparent when we consider that these implements have been found throughout western Europe by hundreds of seekers, in thousands of places, and to the number of tens of thousands, but never associated with cave implements or objects; while on the other hand, tens of thousands of cavern implements and objects have been found in their appropriate places and never associated with Chelléen or St. Acheuléen implements.

Hundreds of caves and rock shelters have been found throughout western Hurope bearing evidence of their human occupation during this period. Many of them are located on the River Vézere, Dordogne. Plate 5 represents amap of the River Vézere, from Les Eyzies, where it emptiesinto the Dordogne River, to Ly Moustier, 10 kilometers above.
The principal prehistoric caverns in this neighborhood are Le Moustier, La Madelaine, Laugerie Haute and Basse; Gorge d’Enfer, Cro-Magnon, and Les Eyzies, but there are others smallerin size and less in importance, M.

In the summer of 1884 the author visited this locality and inspected and worked in some of these caverns. The cavern of Le Moustier has been excavated to the bed rock throughout, and all traces of human occupation in prehistoric times removed. The principal objects of human industry found therein were points and scrapers, with cores, flakes, chips, débris, ete. On the plateau at the top of the cliff some of the smaller and finer specimens of the St. Acheuléen type have been found, with chips, cores, and débris.

period and that the two stages of culture represent man’s adaptation of his art to the changed environment. In the earlier epoch the climate was warm, and man had apparently, or possibly, no need for shelter or clothing, as no traces of either have been found; all his implements were weapons, and suitable for the chase or, if need be, for war. In the later epoch the weapon became a spearhead or harpoon (more likely the latter), while a new implement, the scraper, is introduced, by which he is supposed to have utilized the skin of animals which he had killed by making them into clothing or coverings. The caverns which were his new habitations furnished him both shelter and warmth.
In the subdivision of the Cavern period the earliest epoch has been called Mousterien from the cavern of Le Moustier (Plate 6). The peculiar art of this epoch and that which caused ing aborts Palinett yaa hie Fa the subdivision are the points (Plate 7)

; est art, yet they are interesting from an artistic point of view no less than from an anthropological, for they are the first improvement in flint chipping, the earliest art learned by man. It is a step in the evolution of that art, and will be followed by another step in the next succeeding epoch. These points are the earliest analogous to spearheads, made or used by man, and undoubtedly
the ancestor or forerunner of all arrow or spear heads.
The Mousterien scraper was the earliest implement of its kind made by man. These, as well as the Mousterien points just described, were made usually of flint, and by chipping. These specimens are additionally interesting as the first step taken by man in the art of tanning and as being the oldest specialized tool or utensil known to him.
The flint chipping peculiar to this epoch, shown by these specimens, is that one side of both utensils is left smooth as when struck from the nodule or nucleus by the blow that knocked off: the flakes (Plates 7 and 8, fig. a). The back has been made shapely by smaller flakes, usually three in number, struck off longitudinally (Plates 7 and 8, fig. b). This is the very beginning of this art, and as we see how the operation became improved we will wonder at the adeptness with which it came to be performed.

The art of flint chipping has never, in prehistoric times, nor among prehistoric or savage peoples, attained a higher degree of excellence than during the Solutréen epoch. There seems to have been an evolution from the rude and heavy Chelléen implement up to the fine Solutréen leaf-shaped blades. What time elapsed between the two we have no means of determining; it is to be counted by geologic epochs and not by years or centuries. There was a regular and steady improvement in the art of flint chipping, produced, apparently, by continued experiment and practice, the result of which must have been communicated or transmitted from father to son, from teacher to student, from master to apprentice, until the ideal flint chipping was attained in the Solutréen leaf-shaped blades (Plate 9). During this ; epoch the spear-heads of the Mousterien epoch became perfected in form, style, and delicacy of manufacture. They increased in length and decreased in thickness, until the standard implement took the shape of a laurel leaf and the name “ leaf-shaped,” which name has been perpetuated and extended to similar implements throughout all ages and countries. They will be shown in the chapter on America. The leaf-shaped spear-head was not only enlarged to the largest size, but if was diminished to the smallest, so as to assimi8OUND-ENDED soxvlate them witb the leaf-shaped arrowheads (Plate 9).

A further development was wrought by changing cat. no. s9s12, u.s.N.M. these implements so as to m:** »% shoulder on one sep cua <= side (Plate 10), and herein it was probably the ancestor or precursor of the notched or shouldered arrow and spear head which traveled throughout both hemispheres while civilization was yet young, and long before history began.
Thesame kind of development was made in the scrapers, by which the scraping edge was changed from the side to the end (fig. 16), and this round-ended scraper has continued through all prehistoric times and among almost all savages in historic times who have used any such kind ofimplement. Practically the same utensil has been seen in the hands of untaught savages by men still living. The stone scraper of the Eskimos, used until the advent of the Russian on their shores, was not different in form, appearance, or manufacture, and probably not in use, from that which began in this epoch. The same utensil was prevalent among North American Indians as it was among all savages who used Skins for dress or tent covering, and so had need to use the scraper. The teshoa, so named by Dr. Leidy, and used by the Indians on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, is the principal, if not the only, exception. This was simply a round or oval spawl struck from a smooth quartzite or other hard bowlder, the scraping edge of the spawl making the edge of the tool. The United States National Museum possesses Specimens of it. (Cat. Nos. 170602, 170667, and 11540, U.S.N.M.)

M. Lartet named this the Keindeer epoch because of the great number of remains of this animal found during his explorations in southern France. Plate 11 is a perspective view of the station of La Madelaine. It is a rock shelter, not being of sufficient depth to be called a cave or cavern. The rock overhangs, as is shown in the plate and as is still better shown in plate 12, of Laugerie Basse. The base of the cliff was eroded by the stream and the projection afforded shelter for its human occupant. The author spent some time in this station, and. found it, contrary to the condition of the other stations, far from being exhausted. Its owner prohibits further excavation by the public, and requires everything to be done under his own supervision and with his special permission.

The culture of La Madelaine was similar to that of Laugerie Basse (See map, Plate 5), but Laugerie Haute had a somewhat different culture, and this caused La Madelaine to be chosen as the representative and to have given its name to the epoch.
Laugerie Basse.—Plate 12 is a perspective view and section of the rock shelter of Laugerie Basse. Many objects of prehistoric human industry and art have been found init. It was undoubtedly occupied for a long period of time. The house shown was located on or over the entrance to the cavern, which, however, had previously been filled with fallen rocks and earth. The entrance for excavation of the cavern was through the house and under its floor. The principal work of excavation was done by M. Massenat, of Mailmont, near Brives (Correze). The overhanging rock, projecting about 45 feet, afforded the shelter. This precipice of rock extended with intervals for several miles up and down the river, with many other occupied caverns and rock shelters, which showed a dense population or long-continued occupation, or both.
Despite the employment of horn and bone, flint continued to a large extent to be used for implements. The scraper of the Mousterien epoch had its edge on the side, while in the Madelainien epoch the scraping edge had changed to the end (fig. 17), and this form continued into historic times. Flint flakes abounded 2 during this epoch, some large, long, and thin, with oS Wig 19. sharp edges, probably used for knives (fig. 18); others Finrpoinrsor priits. small and fine, with delicately wrought corners ™ ae ee ee and points (fig. 19 a, b), probably intended for drills. artet and Christy. Natural
Here we leave paleolithic flint chipping, and bepa cause the man of this epoch turned his attention to other manifestations of art, we have to follow him. The subject will receive further attention in the chapter on the Neolithic period.
This epoch is most important in the history of art, marking as it does the earliest human expression of the beautiful, of art for art’s sake. It has been said that this expression marks the first step in evolution from savagery. If so, this step was first taken during this epoch and in this locality, for here prehistoric art of the Paleolithic period made its first manifestation and attained its highest grade.
The art of this locality was indigenous. It was not an imitation, and it seems not to have been borrowed nor to have migrated. It appears to have been a manifestation of the natural art tendencies of the human mind.' It consisted sometimes of sculpture done in the round;

sometimes of etchings or engravings on stone, bone, or horn. If on wood, such specimens have decayed or been otherwise lost. Bone, horn, and ivory became known during this epoch, and were now first employed by man for «esthetic and decorative purposes as well as for utility.
Judge E. Piette, one of the most ardent and persistent explorers of the prehistoric stations of France, confining his investigations largely to the grottoes, caverns, and rock shelters belonging to the Paleolithic period, having spent twenty-five years in this pursuit, has made dis| coveries and formulated theories with regard to the arts and industries of the early prehistoric man in that country that are entitled to serious consideration.
He awards the fullest credit to the investigations of Lartet and Christy, of Vibraye, Franchet, Garrigou, and others. He admits the discovery of three types of human industry as found in the caverns of Le Moustier, Laugerie Haute, and Madelaine, and eulogizes De Mortillet for his creation of the Archeo-Ethnologic science, or as De Mortillet himself puts it, Palethnology.
Judge Piette concedes the importance of the discoveries and studies of these leaders, and joins their followers, now comprising all the students of the science in France and nearly all in Europe, and the rest of the world, in the belief now universally accepted that man occupied western Europe contemporaneously with the great mammals of the prior geologic epoch, now extinct, such as the three species of elephant, the cave bear, Lrish elk, and Rhinoceros merckii and tichorinus.
The early explorers were so elated with the discovery of the many evidences of this early existence of man that they were apparently content to note only the differences in the objects of his art and industry found in the different caverns. Judge Piette pushed his investigations another step and sought to discover stratigraphic differences in every cavern explored. In this task he has been eminently successful, and has traced through the various strata of the different caverns the origin of human art and industry, its evolution, apogee, transformations, decline, and sometimes its disappearance. Out of all this he has, while adhering generally to the classification of De Mortillet, made some changes and given new names. He doubts if the origin of man or his first appearance as man is accounted for in De Mortillet’s classification. So he gives to his earliest term the name of “passage,” associating man with the Hlephas antiquus, E. meridionalis, E. primigenius, and a pliocene fauna. His Chelléen epoch has the same fauna, with a predominance of EHlephas antiquus, and all this he declares to have been preglacial.
His next grand division includes the Glacial epoch with the divisions of Mousterien, wherein man was associated with the Hlephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus and Ursus speleus. This comprises the art and industry of the same epoch in de Mortillet’s classification.

<<<Page: 431>>>

Piette’s classification here differs from de Mortillet’s, he inclining to use the names of animals and of industries rather than of localities, so instead of Solutréen and Madelainien he calls them Equidian, Tarandian or Cervidian, and Hippiquian. But so far as these epochs relate to art he denominates the entire period as “ Glyptique,” and divides them, beginning with the earliest, according to their respective strata as found by him in the caverns, as follows: (1) Sculptures in the round; (2) sculpture in bas-relief; (3) engravings, champlevé aud simple, needles, harpoons of reindeer and deer horn. This closes his period ‘‘Glyptique,” and takes him into the epoch of transition at the close of the Glacial period. In the latter part the ancient animals have become extinct and are replaced by the modern fauna. His next subdivision, still in the Paleolithic period, he calls “Asylien,” from the Grotte Mas d’Azil, the peculiar art product of which was the colored pebbles to be described in the paragraph on painting. During this last division of the period of transition the glaciers had disappeared, the climate had changed, and the reindeer and other cold-loving animals had departed. Theclassification of Judge Piette subsequent to this, though changed somewhat in form and name, is substantially the Neolithic or polished-stone age, the age of bronze, and the first age of iron, as now recognized by prehistoric archeologists.
Judge Piette says that the remains of Hquus predominate in the lower strata in the caverns, while the remains of Cervus predominate in the upper strata or those next above; and for this reason he makes two principal divisions of his period Glyptique—Equidian and Cervidian. He draws from these facts the conclusion that there was a change in the food of man. During the earlier period he used more horse meat, which accounts for the larger number of bones; while in the later period he used a greater amount of deer meat, which accounts for the greater number of the bones of reindeer, deer, etc. From these circumstances and those growing out of them he speculates upon a change of climate. Horses, it is said, would only live in a moderately cold climate on plains producing grass and similar food. The reindeer, on the other hand, prefer dry and cold food, as moss and lichens, and they will thrive and increase in a climate where horses would perish. Piette certifies to the fact that the replacing of the horse by the reindeer is more complete in the caverns in the mountains than in those in the valleys and on the plains. One point made by Judge Piette is that much the largest number of sculptures in the round (which forms his first division) were in ivory, while the greatest number of engravings and other specimens of the Glyptique art were on horse bone and reindeer horn. This, curiously enough, is the order in which the animals furnishing the respective materials are agreed to have lived in that country—first the elephant tribe, mammoth, etc., then the horse, and lastly the reindeer.
It is not intended by the author to followin this paper Judge Piette’s

<<<Page: 432>>>

classification. It may be more correct than any other, but that has to — do with archeology rather than with art, and so its consideration need — not be here continued. Nor is it intended, in presenting specimens of art, to attempt any chronologic order of their appearance, nor to separate them into schools or classes. This may be done in the future, but the science of Prehistoric Anthropology is not sufficiently advanced to enable it to be done now with assurance of success. The prime fact with which we have to deal is that these specimens were made by man at a period of high antiquity, and that they show an unwonted ability — in primitive art. We have here art for art’s sake. Artists and art critics may theorize as to its origin, but here we have the hard fact.

The most wonderful exhibition of art in this epoch was in the representation of animal life. Sometimes the animals are at rest, but many times they are in action. Hunting scenes are depicted in which the hunter, a man, is shown in pursuit of his game and in active conflict with it. In one aman is throwing a spear; in another the serpent bites his heel; deer are shown in action; the reindeer with his nose high in the air and horns thrown on his back; a reindeer browsing and representing a veritable landscape with perspective drawing. The engraving and sculpture represent the mammoth, the reindeer, horse, bison, musk ox, birds, fish, serpent, and others. Some of these are arctic animals now found only in cold countries, others are extinct. A mammoth was engraved on a plaque of ivory (part of his own tusk), a

cave bear was engraved on a pebble of schist, a poniard was made of reindeer horn, the handle being in the form of the reindeer himself. These all came from southern France, and are evidence of the existence of these animals in that locality, for the artist must have seen them before he could depict them. They are the first known drawings from life.
Gravers.—Fig. 20, a, b, c, d, represents gravers of flint. These gravers are not dressed to a sharp point from all sides, but have a V-shaped point, as does the graver’s tool of to-day. We have many of the originals in the National Museum, of which some are quite worn, while others are sharp and could be now used to engrave the bones as in prehistoric times.
The implements and utensils of everyday use were decorated with an art by no means contemptible. The ornamentation of harpoons, daggers, and similar objects shows an appreciation of decorative art as applied to household or domestic uses not

signs are geometric, and made by dots or lines arranged with greater or less regularity, straight, curved, or broken. The figures are formed in festoons, zigzags, hatched work, but more frequently in chevrons. With the employment of almost every kind of geometric design, forming elaborate combinations, we have to remark that the more simple—notably circles, crosses, or triangles—were not employed. (Plates 13, 14, 15.)
Harpoons.—The art work on harpoons exhibits considerable artistic ability as well as manual dexterity (fig. 21, a, b, ¢, d). The art work of these is displayed in the purity of the drawing, in the straightness of the lines, in the symmetry of the design, and in the general accuracy and truth with which it has all been executed. The main shaft of

the harpoon is straight from one end to the other, while the barbs are symmetrically placed; whether opposite or alternated, their spaces are equal, they have the same form, and point in the same direction. Animals.—The animals of this epoch were represented in great numbers, about three hundred specimens having been discovered, comprising nearly every animal known. There are some reptiles, more fish, a few birds, and many mammals. The reptiles are scarcely determinable. Of the fish, the salmon, the trout, and the brochet have been recognized. A swan was found at Laugerie Basse. There is a fair representation of what is probably the entire fauna of the epoch. The principal ones were the cave bear, mammoth, reindeer, horse, ox (two species, the urus and the aurochs), deer, mountain goat, antelope, chamois, wild boar, wolf, fox,

One is the small animal resembling a cat, engraved on both sides of the bone disk (fig. 58). To this list of animals, of course, man must be added.
The cave bear.—Fig. 22 is an engraving on a flat stone or water-worn pebble of schist, about 6 by 4 by 1 inches, found by Dr. Garrigou in the Grotto of Massat (Ariege), a few miles south of Toulouse. The original is in the prehistoric museum in Foix, where the author saw it. The characteristics of the animal are well represented; one can see its prominent forehead, the irregular line of its back, immense body, short and heavy legs. It is identified as the Ursus speleus, or great cave bear, which occupied that country in numbers during the Quaternary geologic period. It is extinct and has been during all historic time.

<<<Page: 441>>>

Its existence is only known from the finding of its fossil bones (fiftyseven individuals were found in the neighboring Grotto of Herm), and from this the only pictorial representation of it ever made from life. The engraving bears its own evidence of genuine antiquity. It shows a certain degree of art and will compare favorably in point of execution with the average representation in outline of such an animal in our naturalhistory school-books. The correctness of the drawing seems to be indisputable, for it corresponds exactly with the fossil skeletons of the animal. The United States National Museum possesses a skeleton of one of these animals in Anthropological Hall (Cat. No. 172850).

The lofty skull, the bulging and curved forehead, thecurved tusksand shaggy hair, identify it satisfactorily. There have been many skeletons of the mammoth found in various parts of the world, all fossil. That from the Arctic regions of Siberia, found by a Russian merchant, is well known. It was brought down, reconstructed, and is now exhibited in the museum at St. Petersburg. The sketch of that specimen, made by the traveler who discovered it, was not better made than is this one, done by the cave dweller of southern France. It is so well done that one must believe the artist had seen the animal, if he did not make the drawing from real life.

This paper has nothing to do with real mammoths, when or where existing. It deals only with artistic representations of the animal made by prehistoric man. Certain engravings of the mammoth have been found in the United States which are claimed to have been made by the aborignes. The author inserts them here, so that all pictures of this animal will be grouped together for comparison as works of art, and not at all with the contention that they belong to the same epoch, were made by the same people, or that they represent the same culture. The American specimens are inserted solely for convenience of comparison,
Mammoth (Lenape stone).—Plate 16 (fig. 1) shows the celebrated Lenape stone which has been described by, and received the approval of, Mr. Henry C. Mercer, Curator of American and Prehistoric Archeology, Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.
This paragraph has been submitted to Mr. Mercer with a request for his criticism. He wrote the following:
Eleven years have passed, during which I have continually watched the subject. I have found no reason to doubt the genuineness of the Lenape stone. The specimen still in the possession of Col. H. D. Paxson is an isolated case that might well have deserved prolonged study on its merits.
At a time when uncertainty prevailed as to human antiquity in North America, as to the late survival of certain Pleistocene animals like the tapir, sloth, peccary, castoréides, mastodon, and mammoth, and as to the true scope of Indian picture writing, this surprising document came to light suddenly near a center of archeological study.! Not marred by any patent flaw, or notoriously treacherous association, it seemed to invite active investigation from the outset. But the position of those then responsible for the welfare of archeology, who at little pains deposited an onus probandi on the shoulders of the witnesses for the stone and went on their way, has been negative from the first. To say again that they have not visited the locality, have not addressed themselves to the pros and cons, and have ignored three other
carved stones found at the same locality, is to reiterate a conviction that they have slighted the subject.
It has been objected that, while the object itself was original, the design or engraving thereon was modern. Mr. Mercer still believes in the genuine aboriginal character of the engraving as well as of the object.
No argument is here made on this question, which belongs to archeology more than to art, but the author sees no reason to doubt the authenticity of the design or engraving, and it is presented as an example of aboriginal American art, representative of a mammoth or mastodon. Mr. Mercer wrote an elaborate description of the stone and its discovery, entitled ‘‘The Lenape Stone, or the Indian and the Mammoth,” published in 1885, and the reader who desires to examine the details and arguments is respectfully referred thereto. The circumstances, so far as concerns us, are that the aboriginal implement of slate represented in plate 16 (fig. 1), of the form called gorget or perforated tablet, drilled and broken as shown, was found in the years

Mammoth (Dr. Cresson, Delaware).—Plate 16 (fig. 2) is another aboriginal drawing of a mammoth in America. It was found by Dr. H. T. Cresson and Mr. Saurault, in the neighborhood of Holly Oak Station, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, Delaware, on the surface of a tilled field which had been covered for manuring purposes with peat taken from what Dr. Cresson ealls “the fallen forest layer in one of the adjoining estuaries of the Delaware River.” The engraving represents a mammoth resembling somewhat that found at La Madelaine (fig. 23). It was engraved in much the same manner, and might

have been done with the same kind of flint gravers. It is on a Fulgur shell, indigenous to America, and found on the coast from Delaware to Florida. The authenticity of this engraving has also been attacked. Dr. Cresson and Mr. Saurault are both deceased, and no other than the internal evidence presented by the object itself and the declaration of its finding as aforesaid can now be furnished. Without stopping to argue for the genuine aboriginal character of the engraving, it is only fair to say that the appearance of the object and of the engraving are indicative of antiquity, and that it presents no traces of modern work. There are no indications of its having been doctored or in any way tampered with, and, like the former disputed engraving, it is presented (subject to future discoveries) as a genuine example of aboriginal art.

ing. This specimen is from the cavern of Thayingen, near Lake Constance, Switzerland. It is engraved upon a piece of reindeer antler and possibly was the fragment of a baton de commandement. The piece here represented is, taken in its entirety, probably the best art picture yet found belonging to the Paleolithic period. The one view Shown represents both sides of the antler, as though it had been unrolled. Spread out thus, it has the appearance of a veritable landscape with water in the foreground, herbage around it, and the grass, etc., in the background where the reindeer REINDEER (HIND LEGS) AND BODY OF A WOMAN, ENGRAVED ON is feeding.

Fig. 25 is an illustration (of which others will be shown) of the use of a piece of material to repeat different objects or views, sometimes each from a_ different point of view, and one overlaying the other. This is a fragment of shoulder blade. It represents a woman’s form which has been engraved, and over it afterwards a reindeer of which the two hind legs only remain.

<<<Page: 447>>>

throughout this chapter, of the natural desire of man in his original state of savagery to enjoy and possess objects which to him were beautiful, and that he was thus prompted to make them in his chosen style of beauty. These specimens represent art for art’s sake. In them savage man was at play with art, and apparently for the sole purpose of gratifying his natural taste for beauty—to satisfy his natural desire for beautiful things. And the same is true of many other specimens. There is no pretense of utility in these. They indicate the use by aboriginal man of such materials as he had within reach to make objects the beauty of which would give him pleasure. This was equally true whether the objects, as harpoons, bone points, spears, batons, were for use or were, like the foregoing, only pictures to be hung on the wall. Fig. 26 represents an engraving on several fragments of the rib of an ox or bison. These fragments were found in the Grotto of Corgnac, Dordogne, and being joined together, were found to fit and to represent a reindeer with a javelin or arrow in his right flank or hip. It was collected by E. Douliot and is in the Musée St. Germain. It has the same pinched appearance of the belly as noticed in the Thayingen specimen.

Fig. 27 is an engraving made upon a fragment of the metatarsal of a reindeer, showing parts only of two animals. The principal one is in view and has been taken for a reindeer. This has been decided by the general outline, the form of the shoulder, and the tuft of hair characteristic of the male reindeer, which appears on the brisket. In front of the ear is an indication of antlers, a slender horn without brow antler, which would indicate a young animal. The hatchings or hair markings on different parts of the body indicate the projections of either bone or muscle. There are imperfections to be noted about the head, if a reindeer was intended to be represented. Though well set on, the head is short, the angle of the lower lip, compared with the chin, is too salient, the nose is dilated as it is not in the reindeer and the eyes are immoderately large.
The horse.—The bones of the horse have been found in some of these caverns in great profusion, and it would appear that this animal spread generally over western Europe in Paleolithic times. Fossil bones have been found which belonged to other varieties of the horse, now extinct.

<<<Page: 448>>>

Whether they were ancestors of the horse or not, as is said by Prof. Edward D. Cope in his celebrated ‘“‘ Phenacodus Primeevis,” has never been satisfactorily determined. There has been found, in the Grotto of Thayingen in Switzerland, near Lake Constance, an engraved bone (fig. 28) representing ananimal of the horse kind, but different from any known variety. It may have been a horse, the drawing of which owes its peculiarity to the inability of the artist, but one can hardly think so, for, while in form, shape, and general appearance this might be,

that in all those peculiarities wherein it differs from the horse it should be found to correspond with the anoplotherium, an animal belonging to the Upper Miocene and reported by Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins! as having been found in western Europe. There is a similarity between them which, to say the least, is remarkable. Fig. 29 represents a horse on a fragment scarcely more than an inch long. It was found at Bruniquel, and the original is in the British Museum. Horses were frequently represented. They are all peculiar, but the peculiarities are reproduced in every Cavern of Bruniquel (Tarnengraving.

These were attributed to the peculiarities of the artist rather than to the horse, but since the discovery and reconstruction of the skeleton, notably that by M. E.

three horses have been engraved on one side, four on the other. The horn is of such conformation as to afford a grip at the lower or heavy end, like a pistol grip, while the hole is so placed as to permit the insertion of the index finger. It is evident from inspection that this hole was bored subsequent to the engraving of the horses, for it passes through and cuts off the head of one horse on one side and of two horses on the other. Fig. 32 is a representation of a fragment of a similar bone with a horse engraved thereon and a hole bored, likewise after the engraving. Fig. 33 represents the shed antlers of a young reindeer from La Madelaine, showing the amputation of three tines, and with four holes. Te holes in this, contrary to the former and many others, have either been bored before the decoration, or it was designed in advance for them. The stem or beam has been cut away laterally on each side so as to make a flat surface for the boring of the holes. The top or concave side bears thirty-three transverse notches or cuts, mostly equidistant, though some are arranged in pairs.
; A number of these implements have been found in the Paleolithic caves of western Europe. Their use is unknown and they are so peculiar that nothing should be omitted which will serve for their elucidation. Various uses have been suggested for them, as splitting soft wood, barking trees, or

as weapons for game and for war. It has been suggested that they were to be held aloft in battles in the hands of the chief like
an imperial standard, and so they have been called in French ‘‘bdtons de commandement,” but none of these uses have been proved. The last has attached itself to them as a name, but possibly only in default of a better. Other persons have considered them as mere weapons. M. Pigorini, director of the Kircheriano Museum in Rome, suggests they might have been used as bits for horses’ bridles. Implements analogous and made also of reindeer horn are found among the Eskimos and are said to have been used principally to kill game when near enough to be struck with it in the hand. Some trayelers have given to them the name of “slave killers,” from their alleged use by the Eskimos.
Lartet noticed in his early explorations that they were lacking “ in the more ancient caves or stations which were characterized by the presence of lanceolate (leaf shaped) implements and by older fauna.” He remarks! their absence in the stations Aurignac (Haute Garonne), La Chaise (Charente), Des Fées (Allier), and Gorge d’Enfer. On the contrary, in stations having the barbed bone harpoons, these batons

were found, and he mentions the rock shelters of Bruniquel (Tarn et Garonne), Le Chaffant (Vienne), and the caverns of Massat (Ariege), Les Eyzies (Dordogne), Mont Saléve (Geneva, Switzerland), and Schussenried (Wurtemburg), as having them.
Fig. 34 is an important and interesting specimen of these batons de commandement of reindeer horn. The two figures represent the opposite sides of the same piece. They are, however, turned end forend, and were discovered in 1886 in the Grotto of Montgaudier, not far from Angouleme, in the valley of the River Tardoire (Charente), near the western coast of France, by M. Paignou, who worked in company with M. Albert Gaudry. The archeologie stratum contained another engraved bone, bone needles, polishers, an ivory point, scrapers, and a magnificent Solutréen leaf-shaped blade.
M. Gaudry, the eminent paleontologist of the Museum of Natural History, Paris, received this baton de commandement and it is now displayed in the museum. He made an extended description of the object before the Academy of France in July, 1886. In November he continued the account of his excavations in this grotto, and reported what he found in the lower strata—specimens of bones of the Rhinoceros tichorhinus, corresponding to and contemporaneous with the Mousterien epoch. Below this baton de commandement, in the same stratum and associated with it, were bone points and a barbed harpoon, so M. Gaudry concludes that the stratum containing this baton was subsequentto the epoch of Moustier and contemporaneous with the cavern of Chauffaud, in the same neighborhood. He says of this specimen:

the forms which he depicts. The work isso fine that it requires the magnifying glass to bring out all its beauty. One face of the baton represents two seals, such as inhabited the sea off the coasts of France. One of them is seen in its entirety with his four members. The hinder members, so singularly carried among these animals, are exactly rendered, each foot having five toes. The size and extent of the tail is plainly to be seen. The head is delicately executed. The muzzle with its mustache, the nouth, the eyes, the hoie for the ear, all indicate a degree of artistic ability. The other seal is not to be seen in its entirety; it is larger and has indications of long hair aboutits neck. The fore foot is exact. In frontis a fish, which is either a salmon ora trout. Its spots are shown and the ventral fins are affixed to the abdomen.
On the opposite side of this baton are two animals, long and slim, the longer being 34 centimeters, or 134 inches. They are not complete, but one shows its head and the other its tail. M.Gaudry thinks they represent eels, possibly serpents; non constat, but they may have been sea serpents. All these are represented on other specimens from various caverns and grottoes. Engravings of the seal have been found in the cavern of Varier (?), Haute Savoy, by M. Gosse, one in the Grotto of Gourdan, by Judge Piette; the salmon, or trout, in the cavern of Goye!, Belginm, by M. Dupont; and the eel, or serpent, in Laugerie Haute, by Lartet and Christy.’
Implements have been found which, while similar in form, are in such fragmentary condition that one can not determine their function, but they persistently represent the hole bored as herein described. Some of these should be classed with sculptured rather than engraved objects, bu cross reference should be made so that they may be studied in both classes. Fig. 35, a, b, c, shows three of these objects, all bifurcated, and of which a and b represent animal heads on the end of the bifurcation, while ¢ represents a different decoration. The relation between these fragmentary implements, with their respective holes, and the former implements, batons de commandement, is as yet unknown.
The bison or ox (urus or aurochs).—Fig. 36 represents a man chasing an aurocls or bison. It is engraved on reindeer horn, comes from Laugerie Basse, was found by M. Massenat, and belongs to his collection. The man follows the bison and is in the act of throwing a spear or harpoon at him. Action on the part of both is shown, and the chase is well represented. It is an artistic representation of a prehistoric hunting scene. The position of the arms, especially the right, is awkward. The man has a sardonic grin. The marks, possibly representing hair, nearly cover his body. Whether they were really hair or were intended only to show light and shade and the rounded parts of the body has never been fully decided. M. de Mortillet believes them to represent hair and, therefore, that the man of this epoch was covered with hair. This piece furnished the basis for the reproduction of the man of the Cavern period displayed in the anthropological section of the Paris Exposition of 1889. (Plate 18b.) Fig. a of this plate represents the artists of the Chelléen epoch displayed at the same time and place.

Ruminants (?).—Fig. 39 is one of those uncertain animals classed by Lartet and de Mortillet as ruminants, leaving the species undetermined. Lartet says:!
The size and shortness of the shoulder, while excluding the reindeer, the stag, and the horse, might yet serve for a bovine animal, but the fracture at the attachment of the horns deprives us of the means of judging if it be of this character. The withers do not seem high enough for the aurochs; or, at least, they would do only for a young individual.

That it is bovine is indicated by the smallness of the tail, straightness of the hocks, advanced position of the male organ, and the sudden rise at the withers; unfortunately the fracture occurs where the long, shaggy mane, determinative of the species, ought to begin; but the foregoing are all characteristic of the bison. There is no drawing upon the opposite side.
The specimen represented by fig. 41 is remarkable in that it was discovered and displayed long before any person in Hurope suspected the existence of prehistoric man. This specimen was found in 1824, by M. Brouillet in the Grotto of Chaffaud, in the valley of the Charente. M. Brouillet was a notary at Charroux. He kept this specimen in his collection until the year 1851, when he sent it to the Musée Cluny.

palm of a reindeer’s brow antler, found by M. Lartet at Laugerie Basse. It bears the nearly entire engraved outline of a horned animal. The horns point upward with a slight backward curve; a short distance behind the horns is an indication of ears; below the chin is a tuft of hair or beard. The croup, tail, and fore feet are destroyed by fractures. The hind legs are sadly distorted in whatever position the animal may be represented; even if he was engaged in scratching himself with his feet, it was impossible that he should scratch his belly with both hind feet at once. But all the characteristics mentioned point to the possibility of an ibex or similar animal.

Examples of art practice.—These art manifestations were intended by their makers not alone for utility, “as in the decoration of implements, weapons, and utensils, but they display a love of art for art’s sake. Many of them, as already shown, appear to have been made for practice, or from a natural and innate love of the beautiful. They are mere essays, in which the artist used the same piece without any attempted relation of one figure to the other. The sketch of five reindeer, Marquis de Vibraye’s collection (fig. 62), is an example. Another is the sketch (fig. 64) of eight animals, horses and deer, from the cavern of Lortet. Each of these specimens consists of a single piece, the lines of each figure running into each other. The drawings have been done on different planes, so that some are upside down, some are complete, others incomplete. The ancient artist utilized his material, as does the artist of to-day when he uses the same canvas again and again. The mammoth engraved on a lamination of his own tusk, and the bear on a flat pebble, are done solely for their art; while the sculpture of the mammoth and reindeer, decoration of the handles of daggers and poniards, are such utilization as put one in remembrance of similar work done by Benevenuto Cellini.
Fig. 62 represents an engraving upon a fragment of schistose slate found at Laugerie Basse by Franchet, and belongs to the collection of the Marquis de Vibraye. It represents five reindeer engraved from different points of view. Two of the animals are shown upright, while three others are represented upside down. One sketch is complete and is well done. Nearly every person has seen similar sketches
i in modern studios; the artist practices by making
different sketches or fragments on the same canvas.
These specimens are evidence of the art tendency of prehistoric man, at least in this locality and epoch. While the evidence points in that direction and is hardly explainable upon any other theory, yet the number of these specimens has hardly been sufficient to establish the

Judge Piette’s persistence and success as an explorer into the prehistoric stations of the Paleolithic period in France have already been mentioned. Oneof his most extensive and successful explorations was in the cavern of Brassempouy at Chalosse (Landes). The usual stratification of occupation was found, beginning with the early Paleolithic at the bottom and progressing successively through the later epochs toward the top. The mammoth and rhinoceros, cave bear, cave hyena, and reindeer were found in their respective strata. Ivory was sufficiently plentiful to be dug out by the spade full. Worked points of bone and horn, flint points, scrapers, and flakes, and similar evidence of human occupation abounded.
Engravings on bone and horn were found as in other paleolithic caverns in the district. In stratum KE, about 18 inches in thickness and at a depth of 11 to 12 feet, X specimens of the human form were found sculptured in Fig. 61. the round from ivory. The collection of Judge Piette = #UMAN HEAD. contains nine statuettes of the human female figure in P@vserie Basseivory, seven from Brassempouy, one from Mas d’Azil, irate and one from Laugerie Basse. They were divided into two groups. One represented women, fleshy, gross, with breasts pendant, abdomen round and protuberent, and thighs firm and heavy. One of these Judge Piette has named the Venus of Brassempouy. The second group were the reverse of all this, with figures thin and straight, without protuberances, and slight representation of flesh or muscle, having much the same appearance as fig. 69. One of the latter group, more complete than any other, represented a female head covered with a capuchin bonnet. NAT MUS 96 26

The engravings and sculptures found in excavations of the caverns of this epoch have been, for the most part, but the débris—broken and rejected pieces. They have been found principally among the ashes from the hearth, and are rarely perfect or complete. During this

period there does not appear to have been any care or preservation of anything for future generations, for there were no tombs, no burials, no monuments, and, except the caverns, no habitations. There appears to have been neither opportunity nor incentive to preserve such objects. But in the fragments we can recognize the artistic feeling of the people. It is even contended by some investigators that different schools of art

can be recognized in different localities; that the art of the Pyrenees was different from that of the Dordogne, and the same between the caverns of Switzerland and Savoy and those of western France. The animals represented have been done with sufficient exactness to enable us to determine what was intended. M. de Mortillet has said that while we are here in the presence of the infancy of art it is far from being the art of an infant, and MM. Cartailhac, Chauvet, Piette, Perrot, and

the others who have written upon this subject have followed him in this. These, with other introduced specimens, show the innate desire of man for things beautiful and his natural wish to make them so. Philosophers, psychologists, and even anthropologists have theorized and speculated as to what aboriginal or natural man may have thought, wished, or desired in originating art, and they will continue to do so; but we are, by this work, brought face to face with the solid and irrefutable fact of what he did. The artifacts are our only evidence in this regard. We are dealing with the prehistoric. There is no history, no written record, no record at all, other than these objects. As by them only do we know of the existence of man at this epoch,so by them only can we discover the origin of the art by which they were made and the thoughts, wishes, and desires of the man who made them.
In order to justify any speculation concerning the ratiocination or psychologic manifestations of primitive man in inatters of art or decoration, it is proper we should first know as much as possible of the facts of those manifestations. Almost the sole purpose of this memoir is to collate and present these facts. Its title declares this purpose. With mere speculations it has little to do, but in the presentation of facts concerning the origin of human art as shown in its earliest known manifestations it makes serious claims.
The specimens of engraving and sculpture may be divided as follows: (1) The engraving by simple lines cut in plain surfaces which corresponds to the engraving of our own time; (2) engraving more or less in relief, and (3) sculptures in the round, representing human or animal figures. VPiette reverses their order and contends that they occurred thus.

The manner of working would seem to have been as follows: With the aid of flint instruments, which may have been knives, flakes, points, scrapers, or what not, the surface of the material was prepared by the removal of the outside or rough portion. The reindeer horn was preferred to that of other deer, probably because its surface was smooth

<<<Page: 470>>>

and firm. These pieces of flint or similar ones are always found associated with the engravings. The surface having been prepared, the objects to be represented are outlined, probably, by marks with the graver, cutting away the substance to a greater or less depth, according to the sketch desired. The knives, flakes, and gravers may have

No evidence has been found of the actual employment of a handle. The scrapers are more likely to have been so used, for the same implement inserted in a handle has been employed in modern times by the Eskimo.
In the sculptures the surface, after having been reduced to proper form, seems to have been polished by rubbing, and accordingly there is found just such an implement as would perform this service, and no other service than this has ever been suggested to account for the existence of the implement. Itis apiece of flint, called in French re-

(2) They were made by the man of the Paleolithic period.
(3) With these tools and implements it is quite possible to do the art work ascribed to that period.
(4) With the engraving implements and tools herein described are found other objects made by man, and all these are associated in suf: ficient numbers to establish their common use.
From these facts the conclusion is drawn that the work was done with these implements.
Stone, ivory, bone, horn, wood.—There are several engravings and sculptures in stone, but they are comparatively few. The fragments of two such were found at the station of Solutré, but it is not well determined what animals they were intended to represent. The great cave bear on a waterworn schist or schistose pebble, found at the Grotto of Massat; a horse found at Les Eyzies by Lartet and Christy; and the sketches on slate of five reindeer from La Madelaine; with some small examples from the Grotto of Chaffaud, are the principal examples of the use of stone.
Ivory was employed principally for sculpture, as witness the discoveries of Judge Piette at Brassempony and Mas d’Azil just described (pp. 374 and 400), though the representation of the mammoth on his own tusk, en eee onan found by Lartet at La Made(HEADLESS). laine, was anengraving.

would cut or scratch in any direction. It furnishes about three-fourths of the specimens of the art work of the period.
Wood may have been employed for art work, but of this we have little or no proof. Reasoning by analogy, we may conclude that it was so used. It was easier to work than was bone or horn, and would serve equally as well for many objects. The objection that no such specimens of wood have been found is offset by the answer that they may have all decayed.

While the art products of Paleolithic man ran principally to sculpture and engraving, there is evidence of his acquaintance with and practice of the art of painting. Color has been used in decoration by
prehistoric man.

The characteristics specially noticeable in the present connection were the hundreds of waterworn pebbles, flat, oval, with rounded edges, resembling in

tion. Judging from their appearance and material, the pebbles had been gathered in the bed of the stream Arise, which flows through the Grotto Mas d’Azil. They were of quartz, quartzite, and schist, and run from white to gray. They were artificially colored with iron peroxide, still found in the cavern. It was ground and kept in shells (Pecten jacobeus) and in cup stones, specimens of which were found with the paint still in them, and was served with spatulas of bone. The color was red or reddish, rather maroon, about the color of iron rust. The figures consisted of dots

from one-fourth to one-half or five-eighths inch in diameter, placed in rows on the flat sides of the pebbles, from one to eight on each pebble; of bars or parallel bands of the same character; of zigzags, crosses, some circles with central dot, and others of similar designs in great number. The painting can best be described by supposing much of the work to have been done by light touches of the finger. It was Judge Piette’s theory that these marks and signs had some meaning. They might have formed a numerical system. Still others may have been alphabetic or ideographic signs, still others symbolic. These pebbles were found in a particular stratum of the grotto. They were not placed in any order, but were scattered throughout the stratum. The meaning of the painted designs on these pebbles has never been decided and probably never can be; but in our present state of knowledge they represent man’s earliest use of color for purposes of decoration; and, consequently, were the very beginning of the art of painting! They may be more than this, but of this much we may feel certaiin, that whatever was intended by their makers, whether they were for ornamentation only, “art for art’s sake,” or had some special signification as numbers, signs, symbols, etc., they were surely an appeal to the color-sense through the eye, and so represent the very beginning of the painter’s art. They were an advance upon the glyptic art which had theretofore prevailed, and had thus far been the only artistic manifestation by man.
For description of the excavation of Mas d’Azil see “ Etudes d’Ethnographie Prehistorique,” by Judge E. Piette,’ and for illustration of the colored pebbles see supplement to same paper.’
The employment of colors in the execution of savage art can be traced to a considerable antiquity; and their use, though continued into modern times, does not at all depend upon the intervention of: civilized man.
The original mineral colors were probably the red and yellow ochers, red and yellow iron oxides, black from charcoal, and white from chalk and lime; but vegetable colors were not difficult to obtain from leaves, fruits, roots, stems, and seeds; for the extraction and use of these pigments and colors in the various savage decorations and adornment was not above the most primitive conceptions. While there is no trace of the use of colors in Paleolithic times in Europe until the late discovery of Judge Piette, and but little in Neolithic times of that country, yet the employment of colors by prehistoric peoples of other countries was extensive and effective. Beyond this, it displayed considerable power and was withal difficult of execution.
The use of an extensive scale or palette of colors by our North

American Indians is well known. The works of Col. Garrick Mallery on “Picture writing of the American Indians,” of Dr. Washington Matthews on the Navajos, of Dr. W. J. Hoffman, Dr. J. W. Fewkes, Mr. F. H. Cushing, Col. J. J. and Mrs. Stevenson, and others, are filled with illustrations of the use of color by these savages. One has only to call to mind the descriptions and representations of the early travelers, or the pictures of Catlin, whose ‘Gallery of Indian portraits” is in the National Museum! to recognize the fact. These instances, while perhaps all historic, are representative of culture beginning before the advent of the white man.
The Peruvians and the Mexicans were adepts in placing the colors upon their cloths. The colors were so well fixed that they were not even modified by the decomposition of the dead bodies, and the wrappings of mummies buried centuries ago retain their primitive colors, even when the original fabric is decayed to shreds.
The Mexicans probably obtained the remarkably brilliant coloring of their pictographs by somewhat analogous processes. These pictographs in manusevipt, of which only a small number have reached us, embrace the history of the country, its national traditions, the genealogies of its kings and nobles, the rolls of provincial tributes, the laws, the calendar, religious festivals, and the education of the children—a complete summary, in fact, of all that concerns the manners, customs, and life of the people. They were painted in various colors on cotton cloth, on prepared skin, or on a strong and tough paper made from the fibers of the agave. At times the artist depicts scenes from rea] life. At other times he records facts by means of hieroglyphic, symbolic, or other characters—conventional signs that have been handed down for generations, and on which innovation is prohibited. Another series of pictures illustrates the education of children, their food and punishments. The father teaches his son to carry burdens, to steer a canoe, or to manage the fishing tackle. The mother instructs her daughter in domestic duties; she sweeps the house, prepares tortillas, and weaves cloths. These pictures present the distinct outlines and bright colors which the Americans sought most of all. Evidently we must not ask them for models of decorative painting. Their complete ignorance of proportions and the laws of perspective demonstrates that their art was the exclusive product of their own genius or of the instinct of their race, and that they had not been subject to any foreign influence.
The region of piedras pintadas (painted stones) in South America extends from Guiana to Patagonia. They are found in the wilds of
3razil and La Plata as well as in the more civilized districts of Peru and Chili, and they betray everywhere a reniarkable analogy. In the solitudes of Para and Piauhy, Brazil, are numerous intaglio sculptures executed by unknown peoples. They represent animals, birds,

and men in various attitudes. Some of the men are tattooed; others wear crowns of feathers; and the picture is finished with arabesques and scrolls. At La Sierra de Onca are drawings in red ocher, isolated and in groups, without apparent order; and the rocks of the province of Ceara and those of Tejuco are covered with tracings not unlike those on the rocks of Scandinavia. Humboldt describes intaglios on the right bank of the Orinoco representing the sun, moon, pumas, crocodiles, and serpents, ill-formed figures defined most frequently by a simple outline and manifesting slight advancement in art.
A few words as to the characteristics of the art of the Paleolithic period. It has been already said there were some geometric designs. These were by lines or dots, and, curiously enough, never or rarely in the form of a cross, triangle, square, or circle, concentric or otherwise. They consisted of parallel lines, sometimes crossed, sometimes drawn in different directions, zigzags, chevrons, and sometimes the double chevron, giving it the appearance of the letter X. On some of the long, straight instruments of bone appear undulating, wavy lines, and in a few cases are round, slightly pointed projections—protuberances like a mamelon.
In all these combinations of figures none have been found which seem to have any meaning or to have the form of any letter, word, or hieroglyph. They do not correspond to any sign, ideographic or hieroglyphic. The cross is not found; there is no representation of sun worship, nor of the sea, nor of any divinity, good or bad. Apparently there had been no thought other than that apparent upon the face of the picture. For instance, when horses are represented following each other we can understand there is a drove. When the mammoth is represented, we understand that the artist has seen the animal. Whena man is represented following the bison and in the act of throwing his spear, we can understand that a hunting scene is meant. Beyond these and similar views uo ideas seem to have been attempted. But we are to remember the paucity of the sources of our knowledge.
The designs, whether of drawing, engraving, or sculpture, seem to have been original in so far that they were neither copied from other drawings nor adapted from other schools or masters. They do not seem to have been composed pieces, but drawings made direct from nature with the original before the eye of the artist. Those representing the two horses’ heads and that representing the hind legs of the reindeer and the naked woman would appear to have veen of this kind.
There have been found in western Europe about four hundred specimens of this engraved and sculptured art work belonging to the Paleolithic period. Of these, four fifths are representations of animals. How many sketches—mere essays or attempts—have been found, the author has no means of knowing. The-e are on fragments and are not sup

posed to have had any utility. Of the implements 1tenaed for use and thus decorated, the batons de commandement are in the greatest number; then dagger points of deer and antelope horn, and the handles of poniards. The Musée St. Germain possesses one hundred and sixteen objects of the art of this epoch. Among these are twenty-nine batons de commandement, twenty-two daggers of antelope or deer horn, and five handles of poniards; total of these specimens fifty-six, or about one-half the entire art collection of that museum. The rest are either objects of unknown use or else sketches not intended for any use.
The United States National Museum possesses one hundred and fiftysix specimens, originals and casts, belonging principally to the Wilson collection.
Be it understood that only those stations or caverns in which art objects have been found can be reported. We cau easily believe that there are many wherein they exist but have not yet been discovered.
Industrial objects and implements are found associated with the art objects, and consequently were made by and belonged to the same people, and these are disseminated throughout western Europe in almost every locality occupied by Paleolithic man. These localities extended from the Pyrenees to central England and from the Atlantic Ocean to northeastern Switzerland. Divided according to departments in France, cantons in Switzerjand, and shires in England, the distribution, with the names of the principal caverns containing this art work, is as follows:
Beginning with the department of Dordogne, which has furnished about one-third of the number found, the caverns are: La Madelaine, Laugerie Basse, Laugerie Haute, Gorge @Enfer, les Eyzies, Cornac; Mayenne—Cave Margot; Vienne—Cottes, Chaffaud; Charente— Chaise, Montgaudier, Placard; Tarn-et-Garonne—Bruniquel; Landes— Sordes; Haute Pyrenees—A uresan, Lortet; Haute Garonne—Gourdan; Allier—Massat, Vache; Aude—Bize; Gard—Pont du Gard; Haute Savoy—Saléve; Schaffhausen, Switzerland—Thayingen; Arrondissement de Dinant, Belgium—Goyet, trou Magrite; Derbyshire, England—Cresswell.
Discoveries of paleolithie art are being continuously made in western Europe, thus demonstrating the correctness of former conclusions and the genuineness of former discoveries as well as the long and extensive human occupation in paleolithic times. Some of those reported since the writing of the foregoing chapter are that of M. Julien of the statuette in steatite of a woman in the caverns of Moutone, now in the museum of St. Germain, reported by Solomon Reinach;! that of E. Riviére in the grotto of la Mouthe, Commune de Tayac, near Les Eyzies, Dordogne, wherein the art work consisted principally of carvings of animals on

the rocky walls of the cavern! associated with objects and evidences of Madelainien art, gravers bone points, etc.; further discoveries of M. Riviére in the celebrated Cavern of Cro-Magnon at Les Eyzies.? There not only former paleolithic objects of industry were continued, but the gravers and engraved bones were found, the most important being a fragment of rib bone with the figure of a female engraved in profile and at full length. Also art works similar to those in the Grotto de la Mouthe found in the cavern of Pair-non-Pair, excavated by F. Daleau (Bourg-sur-Gironde) and F. Regnault.’
The nomenclature of the different art cultures heretofore described belonging to the Paleolithic period in Europe is of small importance compared with the facts of their superposition and succession in point of time and their evolution in art. The fact of progression from an earlier and ruder to a later and higher art culture seems to have been satisfactorily established by investigation of the caverns themselves. The caverns were gradually filled up, either by natural or artificial — causes, or by both. By examining the strata in their succession the investigators have demonstrated that there are marked differences in the art and industry between the objects found in the different strata. Of course, the filling up of the caverns must have been in chronologic sequence. Superposition means succession. The distinction between the various epochs in the Paleolithic period or the distinctions between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods are not to be discussed here. The reader is referred to standard works upon the subject. A list of these is given in the Handbook‘ and in Primitive Industry.
A few salient facts may be presented showing this superposition and consequent succession, explaining an improvement in art culture from the bottom of the cavern toward its top. For example, at Kent’s cavern, near Torquay, England, in the caverns investigated with all possible care during a period of twelve or thirteen years, in which as many thousand dollars were expended, under the direction of a committee appointed by the British Association, the strata of these early occupations were covered by layers of stalagmite spread over what was then the entire surface, separating and sealing it hermetically from subsequent occupation. Under this, in various parts of the cavern, were found specimens of Chelléen chipped-flint implements, and beyond the chips and flakes, possibly the hammers incident to their fabrication, no

other traces of human industry was found. In the Grotto of Placard in southwestern France (Plate 17), the same superposition was found, which gave satisfactory evidence of this succession of human occupation and of the accompanying changes and improvements of human culture. The strata containing Neolithic and Paleolithic objects are distinctly marked, and are separated by a sterile stratum made up of imported clay, or earth or of broken stones from the roof of the cavern, several, sometimes many, inches in thickness. The cavern of Laugerie Haute gives the same evidence and is even more positive, for the sterile stratum is about 4feet 3 inches in thickness. In the Grotto dela Vache the stalagmitic stratum between the Paleolithic and Neolithic industries is about 18 inches. The latest indications we have was when M. Boule, of Paris, visited the prehistoric cavern of Schweitzerbild, near Schaffhausen, Switzerland, in the neighborhood of the cavern of Thayingen which furnished the celebrated engraving on bone of the reindeer browsing (fig. 24, p. 381). M. Boule has published a report of his investigations! in which he describes the walls of the cavern with their superposed and consequently successive occupations and corresponding improvements in human invention and human culture. (See Plate 17 c¢.)
Plate 17 (fig. a) shows a perspective of the Grotto of Placard with a section ov. the right side b giving the various strata from bottom to top. The spaces marked A, ten in number, show the strata which were barren, and were without any objects or evidences of man’s industry or occupation. They were formed of rock which had fallen from the roof to the floor during periods when the cavern was not occupied by man. The other letters represent spaces, the strata of which were the opposite of this, and contained objects representing the various epochs of human culture within the period of occupation. LZ contained Mousterien points; A, Solutréen leaf-shaped points; Z, upper Solutréen, with bone points and those of flint, shouldered (pointes a cran); H, F, E, and PD, contained objects clearly Madelainien, bone points, engraved bones, and even a baton de commandement; C, the archelogie stratum nearest the top, contained Neolithic objects, polished stone hatchets, arrow points, fragments of pottery, and bones of modern animals.
The same difference of industry, showing a difference in culture by the stratification in the caverns, occurs in the investigations by Judge Piette in the large number of caverns in southern and southwestern rance, and referred to in this paper (p. 374). In fact, this stratification of culture is the foundation of his classification.
At the conclusion of the excavations and investigations by Lartet and Christy, it was the opinion of many prehistoric archeologists that there was a complete solution of the continuity in the human art and industry, as there was in the human occupation of western Europe at the close of the Paleolithic period. This opinion grew in strength until nearly everyone became an adherent of it. It was evident that the
‘Nouvelles Archives des Missions, III, plate 111 (plate 17, fig. c).

animats which occupied that country during that period materially changed their habitat. The causes of this change have never been completely determined, but it is supposed that climate was the principal one. The fact of the change seems well established. The three species of Elephas—the last being the mammoth, the cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena, and several others—became extinct. Others—the musk ox, blue fox, and more than any other, the reindeer—to the number of thirteen species of animals, all cold loving, migrated to the far north and have never since occupied any portion of the territory in western Europe wherein they were so plenteous during this Paleolithic period. Five other spe— cies of animals, like the chamois, also cold loving, changed their habitat by migrating to the mountains, thus making a complete change of eighteen animals at the close of that period. What became of man? It was believed, as has been said, that he also migrated or perished. At all events, it has come to be the general belief that the evidences of his presence, by objects of either art or industry, ceased altogether; that. there was a hiatus in the occupation of that country by man, which was brought to a close by the migration or entry from the far east, of Neolithic man or man with a Neolithic civilization. The differences between these two art epochs will be treated in the next chapter.
Learned men have speculated considerably concerning the happenings at the close of the Paleolithic period in their relation to man. This was necessarily speculative. It was impossible to procure definite or positive testimony. The only evidence obtainable consisted of the remains of man or of his art or industry, while the chronologic identification of these as subsequent to the Paleolithic period was extremely difficult, if not impossible. One theory is that he migrated to the north, as did the animals which were his contemporaries. The similarity between the art of the Eskimo in earving on ivory and those carvings found in the caverns in southern France and described in this paper has furnished the foundation for this theory. Another theory is that man in western Europe at the close of the Paleolithic period perished. A third theory is that he migrated to the far east, the Orient, assimilated with the peoples there, became a part of the Aryans, and that his art, taking a new lease of life, began its western peregrinations through Mesapotamia, Chaldea, the Caucasus, and culminated in Greece, where it formed another center of culture, and, spreading through Italy in the period of its decadence, it at last reached western Europe, the place of its origin and birth.’
A fourth theory is that he went—just how is not explained—to the north of Africa. The foundation or authority for this is the supposed resemblance in the anatomical and physical characters between some of the tribes belonging to that country and the Paleolithic man of southern France. The Berbers of Africa and the Guanches of the Canary Islands and the Caribs of still other islands in the same

latitude or direction are said to be of the same stock as the cave dwellers of France.
But these are archeological or anthropological questions, only incidentally affecting art, and therefore need no further argument or citation of authority.
Of course no man of any of the epochs of the Paleolithic period has ever been seen, and therefore he is not described by any person of modern or historic times. No history, however ancient, will contain any representation of him. Egyptian, Chaldean, and other Oriental civilizations may contain sculptured representations of man of high antiquity, and possibly one can not say that these were not individuals of prehistoric ages, but no one can say, with any certainty, that they are. Any attempt to reproduce or represent the cave man must be largely theoretical. We have some of his skulls and long bones. We have his pictorial representations as shown by the engravings of that time and figured in this paper (fig. 36). It is said by those anthropologists who have investigated the subject most profoundly, that the Berbers of northern Africa and the Caribs of the islands in the Atlantic Ocean most nearly correspond with the man of Paleolithic times. They judge this by comparison of the anatomy and from a consideration of the evidence. With this for a foundation, the anthropologists of the Paris Exposition of 1889 reproduced groups of the people of the Paleolithic period, which were installed on the foyer of Anthropological Hall. Plate 18 represents two of these groups. Fig. 1 is a man and a woman of the Chelléen epoch, represented in the act of chipping flint nodules and making the implements belonging to their epoch, such as are shown in figs. 1 to 9. Fig. 2 of plate 18 is a reproduction of the cavern of Laugerie Basse, representing a man standing, just returned from the chase; while seated opposite him are two women, presumably his wives, engaged in engraving the bones of the cavern, some of which have possibly been shown in this paper.
Whether the statuettes found by Judge Piette and forming part of his collection were actual representations of the peoples who made them or who inhabited the localities is not determined. Piette is of opinion that they were, and that the specimens represented two groups or races of people—one fat and heavy, the other thin and light.
Sundry modern authors have enunciated various theories of art, based upon the pyschologic proposition of the parallelism of human thought and the similarity of human needs. With this and the assumption of a permanence of the relations of man to his environment for a foundation, they have formed the conclusion that peoples or tribes in a given stage of culture adopt similar arts and indeed a general

<<<Page: 486>>>

technologic similarity. They assert the foregoing rule to be a natural law and applicable to widely separated peoples, and not at all depending upon any communication or correspondence between them. Others applying this theory of similarity of human thought to the evolution of art, principally of ornament, seek to explain every design or pattern,
whether historic or prehistoric, savage or civilized, ancient or modern, —
by declaring that they originally had some occult meaning and that they represented some idea (to us unknown) of the aborigines who invented them. It is declared that if the psychological, including the anthropological, student of the present day could follow these aboriginal designs back to their origin they would find them based on this occult, unknown meaning. Some of these authors, elucidating this proposition, investigate the ornaments of savage or primitive peoples, and seek to demonstrate this occult and unknown thing to have been the origin of all
ornament and design. They argue that by the various processes or. —
evolution, the design changing as the idea changed, gradually, step by step, the idea is lost, and nothing remains to represent it but the present unmeaning ornament.
The author, deprecating the tendency to lay down general rules, concedes the possibility of this genesis of ornament in some cases, but declines to accept it as one of the rules. He believes his illustrations of the earliest designs made by man, their great numbers, and their evidently original invention and adoption as ornaments show that the foregoing genesis of ornament is not the rule, whatever its application in particular cases. He denies the correctness of the general proposition of Professor Haddon, especially in its applicability to prehistoric art, “that those who write in the future on decorative art will have to prove that any pattern or design is a purely arbitrary form. That assumption is no longer permissible.” !
It is always said by the reformers in the psychology of art that their
position could be sustained if we could only get back to the beginning
of the ornament or to the origin of the art. In the present chapter the author has presented the very beginnings of art. No art can, either in point of time or of civilization, be earlier than that here given. The specimens, in their relation to time, date to the Glacial epoch, and in point of civilization to the Paleolithic period. Nothing that we know of man, not even his existence, is earlier than the art works set forth herein. There was no other beginning to art; there is no relation between this and any preceding period, for so far as relates to art and ornament there was no preceding period. Art begun here; these specimens show the natural or original germ of art in the human mind uninfluenced by anything beyond the necessary environment of life and the inevitable conditions of existence.
So far as can be known, the impulse which moved man in this art
'A. C. Haddon: Evolution in Art as Illustrated by the Life Histories of Designs, p. 164,

<<<Page: 487>>>

work was his love of beauty and his desire to gratify it. This love was purely esthetic and without any utility so far as relates to the engravings on bone, ete., and only partly utilitarian when employed in the beautifying of weapons and implements.
This innate love of ornament has been pushed by some primitive peoples to such extremes as to interfere with the utility of the decorated object, as in the carving of the handles of Mangaian symbolic adzes of the Hervey Islanders; but this belongs to more modern times. We are now dealing with the earlier, the Paleolithic man, with man in the infancy of his race, and we find his ornaments to have been more simple; they had not then run to excess nor interfered with the utility of the decorated object.
These engravings and decorations during the Paleolithic period stand as the foundation or beginning of all art, and we will see how, through the civilization to come after them in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, these Paleolithic motifs were repeated again and again, how they varied, how they grew, and yet how, down to the end of the prehistoric and the beginning of the historic period, they never got beyond lines or dots, which combined made the parallel lines, the chevron, the herringbone, the zigzag, and similar simple geometric designs. They all grew out of the same beginning and had the same origin. They had no occult meaning; they never stood for any great divinity or power, whether natural or supernatural; they were simply lines and dots arranged in ornamental form to gratify man’s innate sense of beauty and because he wished the things he possessed to be beauteous in his eyes.
It is needless to discuss the causes of this natural and innate taste on the part of man. He is borm with it, it is part of him, its manifestations afford him pleasure, they gratify his senses, and are to be classed in the same category as the delights of the palate, the beauties of color, and the sweetness of music. He has these tastes, he enjoys their gratification, and he indulges them when he has the opportunity.
Mr. W. J. Stillman, in “Old Rome and the New,” says:
The modern conception of the arts of design is that they are intended as the mirror of nature; the ancient and true one is that they were the outcome of emotion, aspiration, and imagination or spiritual conception of the artist.
These observations may find other illustrations throughout this paper. They might have been postponed to another portion, but they come properly in this place, and the author has deemed wise to insert them here at the conclusion of this chapter, that reference may be made to them in the future reading.
While there have been inventions and duplicate inventions of new designs and reinvention of forgotten ones, yet it is the belief of the author that as a rule the perpetuation of ornamental designs was by imitation and teaching, passing from generation to generation, from parent to child, and from master to servant or slave. Decorative art

forms part of human culture and civilization, and its extension and distribution among men was accomplished in much the same manner as Sir John Lubbock says of the geographical distribution of human races, which, curiously enough, coincides with that of other animals. “There can be no doubt,” he says, ‘‘ that he crept over the earth’s surface little by little, year by year, just, for instance, as the weeds of Europe are now gradually but surely creeping over the surface of Australia.” !
Out of this erroneous theory of the parallelism of human thought has grown that other equally erroneous declaration of the absolute uniformity in man’s thoughts and actions, in his aims and methods while he is in the same degree of development, without regard to the country or epoch in which he lived. And this theory has been pushed until it has been said nothing but geographical environment seems to modify the monotonous sameness of man’s creations. The theory may be applicable to certain peoples under certain conditions. But it surely has its limitations and is not applicable to individuals. When stated as a rule it does not take into consideration the will, energy, or reasoning powers of man. It leaves out his egoism and his desire for power, improvement, and happiness, which lie at the very foundation of human civilization. The progress of peoples through consecutive stages of civilization is entirely compatible with the author’s theory that knowledge of specific objects, the uses of material things, the performance of certain rites, the playing of certain games, the possession of certain myths and traditions, the carrying on of certain industries, were transmitted from one generation to the next, from father to son, mother to daughter, teacher to pupil, boss to apprentice, master to servant or slave; that the future generations improved or were retarded according to their conditions and surroundings, principally their needs, and their relative intellectual faculties and powers of imitation, and that this knowledge passed from one country to another chiefly by the migration, contact, or communication between their peoples. The knowledge of the same things by separated peoples, within reasonable bounds of similarity, increased by complication of machinery and the * difficulty of construction, may be treated as reasonable evidence of such migration, contact, or communication.
The Neolithic period was first discovered in western Europe, although savages in that culture-status in other parts of the world had been known long before. It, along with the Paleolithic period, is classed as part of the Stone age because the principal cutting implements continued to be made of stone. There were radical differences between these
1 Sir John Lubbock: Prehistoric Times, pp. 587-601.

<<<Page: 489>>>

two periods; differences in climate, geography, fauna, domesticity of animals, sociology, industry, and art.
In the later epoch of the Paleolithic period the climate was cold and dry, with extreme temperatures, while in the Neolithic period the climate was temperate and uniform.
In the Paleolithic period were living many great animals, now fossil, like the cave bear, the giant beaver, and, most plentiful of all, the mammoth. In the Neolithic period these and others to the number of seventeen, became extinct. Out of forty-eight well ascertained animal species living in France and England during the Paleolithic period, only thirty-one continued into the Neolithic period. Eighteen species of the animals living in the center of Europe associated with man in the Paleolithic period were cold loving. In the Neolithic period, thirteen of them, such as the reindeer, antelope, musk ox, blue fox, and white bear, emigrated to colder countries by latitude, while five, the chamois, marmot, wild goat, and others, have emigrated to colder countries by altitude, going up the mountains.
In the Paleolithic period there were no domestic animals; in the Neolithic period they were abundant.
In the Paleolithic period the population was nomadic; they were hunters and fishers, but not agriculturists; in the Neolithic period the population was sedentary, and agriculture became well developed.
In the Paleolithic period there was practically no pottery in England or France. There are two localities in Belgium where pottery is alleged to have been found. In the Neolithic period pottery was everywhere made and used.
In the Paleolithic period there were no monuments or burials, apparently no respect for the dead, and therefore no evidence of any belief in a future state.
DIFFERENCES IN ART OF THE Two PERIODS.
Among these differences the strangest was in the fine arts. In the Paleolithic period we have seen the large number of sculptures and engravings, and that even painting was attempted; how nearly every animal belonging to that epoch, from man down, has been graphically represented in the fine art of that period. On the contrary, in the Neolithic period there are innumerable specimens of decorative art as applied to industry, while we are wholly without graphic delineations of the animals of the period, and no attempt appears to have been made to represent any living thing or to make a representation of nature in any of its forms.
The art of this period was entirely decorative, and consisted of marks, lines or dots, usually by incision, in geometric form, such as hatch marks, zigzags, herring bone, chevrons, parallel lines, and thumb marks.

<<<Page: 490>>>

These decorations were principally employed in plastie art, and usually for the decoration of pottery. Graphic representation of this decoration shows it to have been similar to that of the Paleolithic period. Yet the likeness is more apparent than real. In Paleolithic times the decoration was, as we have seen, principally by representations of objects taken from nature. The geometric designs were used, and it was therefore correct to show them. Their omission would have been improper. But they were used on few specimens, and on these but sparingly. Harpoons and points of bone were the principal objects of such decoration. Turning back to plates 13, 14, and 15, we will see by these harpoons and points how slight was the opportunity of the paleolithic artist, and we know in how few instances he embraced it. His decorations consisted principally of short marks arranged in parallels and repeated so as to make a pleasing effect.
Not so, however, in Neolithic times. The designs, still geometric, were more complete, were larger, more extended, had greater continuity, and, as before remarked, were used a thousandfold more than in Paleolithic times.
Plates 19 and 20 contain representations of geometric decoration. They are all from western Europe, were taken from actual specimens, and ean be identified with the originals. The most of these undoubtedly belong to the Neolithic age, though some may be related to the — Bronze age. This is a matter of no consequence, for the Bronze age was but the continuation of the Neolithic age. They are both believed to have been the same race of people throughout western Europe. Some of these decorations were used indiscriminately during both ages.
This art was begun in the Paleolithic and continued throughout the Neolithic period. The fundamental distinction was that in the Neolithic period, after the preparation of flint implements by chipping or battering and pecking, most of them were finished by the secondary process of grinding, and in many eases, polishing. This distinction between these two periods in the art of flint or stone working has not been appreciated by some of our American anthropologists, and has been the foundation of great errors.
Plate 21 represents one of these livres du beurre. By its side is one of the flakes (Cat. No. 136657, U.S.N.M.), side view, and next to it is another flake represented edge view. If this were an archeological paper instead of being one on fine art, these objects would be fully described, but we are only concerned with the delicate art handiwork of striking off the flakes. This was done with a stone hammer, and

its successful operation required a manual dexterity obtainable only by long practice. It is sufficiently difficult of performance to be ranked among the finer arts. After the preparation of the nodules of flint, so that the blade can be made a sufficient length, with edges smooth and sharp, the upper or top part of the core is struck with the stone hammer (figs. 78a and 78b) so exact and precise as to the proper point and so delicately gauged as to force, that a single blow knocks off the blade its entire length. There can be no second trial; it is success or failure at the first stroke. Plate 22 represents another of these cores and flakes. The United States National Museum possesses many more of the same kind from the same locality. Anyone who doubts flint chipping being a fine art has but to attempt the operation. He will soon discover that it requires a degree of knowledge and manual dexterity which can be obtained only after many trials. In this it can be favor-

ably compared to the art of handling the pencil in drawing, the brush in painting, or the chisel in sculpture. It requires even a higher degree of manipulation than either of these. It involves a combination of intellectual understanding derived from a teacher, and a manual dexterity of the hand obtained only by long practice.
The Paleolithic period showed the origin, the very beginning, of art so far as can be determined from our present knowledge of man. The different manifestations of art in the succeeding, the Neolithic, period opens anew the discussion of its origin. A hiatus has been declared between the culture of the two periods, and the differences just described are supposed to represent the renaissance of art in the Neolithic period. Western Europe may have been the cradle of art for the world. The fine art of the Paleolithic period originated there. In the passage to the Neolithic period some branches died out or were lost; new ones were employed, whether invented or

<<<Page: 504>>>

imported is not determined; but certain ones, such as flint chipping and geometric decoration, and possibly others, were continued into the Neolithic period. These latter arts, though forming the principal motifs of the later period, did not originate in it, but in the earlier period, and are to be credited to it.
The advanced culture of the Neolithic period was not indigenous to western Europe. It must have been imported from some country farther east, whence the Neolithic people immigrated when they settled in western Europe. That unknown country may or may not have had earlier relations with Paleolithic culture (for we know that both civilizations spread over that portion of the globe) and in that country the Paleolithic peoples may have taught the Neolithic. But of this we know nothing except what is obtained from the cultural objects themselves, found in western Europe. The art of flint chipping, for example, appears to have been continued from the earlier to the later period without any hiatus, and this could have been done only by teaching, which involves contact and communication between thetwoages. This contact in western Europe is denied by most prehistoric anthropologists and the theory of a hiatus between the periods in western Europe is generally accepted, though it has been much weakened. Hither the theory of a hiatus must be given up or we must admit contact between the two ages in that unknown Eastern country prior to the migration of the Neolithic peoples to the West. It is easier to believe contact between the two peoples at an earlier period than to believe in a second origin of culture. While certain portions of the cultures of the two peoples have such similarity as to show contact between them, certain other portions have such dissimilarity as to show that the contact was not complete or the communication not perfect. With all the dissimilarities in their culture, it is difficult to believe that the Paleolithic man in western Europe carried away all knowledge of the art of flint chipping or that it was lost (to western Europe) during the hiatus, and that the Neolithic man, on his occupation of that country by migration, reinvented or rediscovered it. The author prefers to believe,as the most reasonable hypothesis, that there had been in some way, unknown though it be, such contact and communication between the two peoples, either before or after their migration, as enabled the later people to learn from the earlier some of their difficult arts, such as the chipping of flint, the making of spearheads, harpoons, and scrapers.
How they came to produce the art of their period is remitted to the same study of psychology required to determine why the man in Paleolithic times should have invented any of the arts. That, we have seen, was because the art objects pleased him. This desire for pleasure was part of the common heritage of mankind, the realization of man’s ideal, which we call his good taste. This good taste is involuntary, explainable only by psychology and on a par with the question why does the child like sweets, or why does one child like sweets and another like
TC fe ee ee
ee eee

<<<Page: 505>>>

sours, or one like music and another not, or like painting, or sculpture, or riches, or science, or literature, or mathematics, or law, theology, medicine, banking, business, war, etc. All we know is that on these subjects (and many others) mankind has an ideal which for the time creates his standard and forms his taste; in time man, through study and contemplation, finds his old ideal fall short of his expectations and he becomes dissatisfied with it; by study and contemplation he conjures a new ideal; a new ideal in art establishes a new standard of taste, and by this he tests his new effort. The argument of condition or environment usually applicable to man’s industry and sociology has slight application to his art. His art is for his pleasure, not for his necessity ; therefore, the foregoing statement relates only to art objects and not to those of utility. The evolution of utilitarian objects as distinguished from art objects is governed by man’s needs, but he has no need, or but little need, for art objects. They are solely for his pleasure, and their evolution or change is only to gratify his changed ideal or standard of taste.
The primary and principal implement required for this art work is the hammer (fig. 78 a, b), by which the blow is struck and the flake or chip knocked off. Rude pieces of hard stone, usually flint, quartz, or quartzite, were used for hammers, their sharp corners serving to increase the precision of the blow. When their corners were worn away so that an accurate blow could not be given they were doubtless cast away or used for other purposes. Practically there is no difference between the stone hammers of different countries in the two ages of Stone.
The successful manipulation of the operation of flint chipping as performed by prehistoric man entitles it to be classed among the fine arts, and requires a few sentences of description. As to material, flint best answers the requirements. It should be homogeneous in substance and crystalline or cryptocrystalline in formation. When properly treated it can be struck off into long flakes or blades, producing a keen, smooth edge much the same as slivers of broken glass. The nodules of flint having been prepared, the art of the operation consists in judging the force of the blow and determining accurately the point of impact; then follows the successful manipulation in carrying out this good judgment. In justification of the claim that this is fine art it can be said that no historic or modern individual has ever attained the success acquired by the artist of prehistoric times.
During the progress of this paper the author has received letters from different parts of the United States giving currency to the report that it was the belief of scientists that the art of flint chipping was a lost art, and that the Smithsonian Institution had offered a reward or bonus to anyone who should make the discovery of how it was done. This report is entirely without foundation. The art of flint chipping, so far as it applies to the small flint or glass arrowheads, or the chipping of these materials, is well known and is or has been practiced by

<<<Page: 506>>>

many persons in the United States. A gentleman from Connectient has sent us a series of small glass arrowheads made by himself. A clergyman from Oregon makes of the mottled jasper-like obsidian beautiful specimens of small arrowheads called jewel points, mounted and sold for use as pins for personal decoration. He makes no pretense of secrecy nor that they are other than his own manufacture, and he sells them as specimens of his art.
Several persons in various parts of the United States, whose names as well as their work are well known, either make new or alter old or broken arrowheads, and they have been known to sell them as genuine. Thus doctored they belong to the class of arrowheads denominated Division IV, Class I. These have been figured and described by the

author! and the public warned against them, which warning seems to
have been acted upon by both makers and purchasers, and the industry in that part of the country has placuuary died out. It is continued in Oregon.
But this industry is confined to comparatively small arrowheads. The large leaf-shaped implements and similar objects made by echipping, which are thin in comparison to their width, made by striking off fine and long flakes reaching to or beyond the center of the implement, leaving the edges keen and sharp, have never been reproduced. Such implements as are represented in figs. 86 to 95, from the United States, and the large ones in plates 9 and 10, from Europe, have never been made in modern times or by modern See

Fig. 79 represents a core of flint from Brandon, England. The flakes (fig. 80) have been struck off, one after the other, going around the outer edge, gauging the proper thickness for the flake, the inside of one forming the outside of the next. With patience one can rearrange the flakes one by one against the core in the inverse order in which they have been struck off until the nodule is reconstructed. The core shows the conchoidal fracture made by each blow, and with the aid of this peculiarity the flakes can be fitted one to the other, as shown in fig. 80. The same operation is performed in making the cores and tlakes of obsidian, to beshown further on (Plate 26).
Conchoidal fracture—The conchoidal fracture is the evidence of a blow. Every blow which produces a fracture in the flint leaves such a conchoidal figure. By it the early discov“a eries of the existFig. 81.

man were made, and human intervention in manufactured objects rendered certain. Fig. 81 represents one of these Brandon flint cores with its flakes all in place, showing how they were struck off, one after the other.
Most of the works on prehistoric archeology relating to the making of arrowheads refer to such stone chipping among modern savages, and many of them contain descriptions by travelers and visitors of the different tools and methods by which flint chipping was done.! As we are dealing with prehistoric fine art rather than prehistoric archeology or primitive industry, we need not further pursue the subject of how to chip flint.
Evans, Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain, fig. 2.
While stone hammers similar to fig. 78 were, as already mentioned, the principal tool with which flint chipping was done, yet other implements were used. The Eskimo has points of bone or horn called flakers, with which, it is said, he pushes or presses off the smaller flakes.
‘Sir John Eyans, Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain; Wilde’s Catalogue of Antiquities of the Royal Irish Academy; De Mortillet’s La Prehistorique ; Stephens’s Flint Chips.

<<<Page: 508>>>

Sir John Evans! shows representations of these flakers. Capt. John Smith, writing in 1606 of the Indians of Virginia, says: ‘His arrowhead he maketh quickly with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracer.” Sir John Evans” says:
No seulptor ever handled a chisel with greater precision or more carefully meas-
ured the weight and effect of every blow than did this ingenious Indian; for even among them arrow making was a distinct profession in which few attained excellence.
Scandinavia stands at the head of prehistoric European countries for excellence in flint chipping during Neolithic times. The specimens from that country stand as models of such art work.
Daggers.—Plate 23 represents a dagger or poniard of flint from Copenhagen. Its length is 8? inches, width of blade 25 inches, and thickness of blade 4 inch. The implement has been made entirely by chipping, the blade in its finishing has been flaked always from the edge, forming a perceptible ridge in the center. The smallness and thinness of the flakes may be imagined from the regularity and smoothness of the edge. Plate 24 represents other specimens of flint from Scandinavia—poniards or daggers. They are of the flint of the country, and the chipping thereof is of the same style and exhibits the same high degree of manual dexterity as the specimen in plate 23. The chipping of the handle of specimen No. 191644, U.S.N.M., is to be noted. It shows how by artistic treatment different effects can be
produced. MEXICO.
Leaf-shaped, Class A.—The Solutréen leaf-shaped implements have already been described and figured (Plate 9). They belong to the Paleolithic period, but the same kind of object, of equally fine art and difficulty of fabrication, was made in the Neolithic period.* This applies equally to America as to Europe. Plate 25 represents these implements from Mexico. They are of the same general type as the Solutréen leaf-shaped implements which forms Class A of the leafshaped division in my ‘Classification of Arrow and Spear Heads.” They are shaped like a laurel leaf, are elliptical and pointed at both ends. Their widest place is one-third or one-tourth the distance from the base. The specimen on plate 25 is from Oaxaca, Mexico, and is 124 inches in length, 32 inches in width, and 2 inch in thickness.
Leaf-shaped, Class A.—Plate 26 presents.a remarkable specimen of stone chipping. It was found, May 20, 1891, on the farm of and is owned by Mr. G. I’. Arvedson, of Carpentersville, Illinois. The mateterial is quartzite, which increases its interest, as quartzite is more

be kept in view. The material of this specimen is not flint, is light reddish in color, comes from a ledge and not from a nodule, is coarse grained and refractory, is not homogeneous, and does not break with a regular or conchoidal fracture. But with these disadvantag es, apparently insuperable to a modern archieologist, the ancient artist was able by his skill to produce as fine a specimen of art work as is here presented. But for its material and the two small notches in one end it might pass for one of the leafshaped implements of the Solutréen period from western Europe.

flint chipping. Its length is 62 inches, aoa 24 inches, thickness }, inch.
Fig. 85 is from a mound near Naples, Illinois, collected by Col. J. G. Henderson. It is of the brown pyromachic flint. It is one of the superior specimens of art in flint chipping; it is leaf shaped, though one end is rounded while the other is pointed; is 74 inches in length, 21 inches in width, and $ inch in thickness. There are few specimens to be seen better representing fine art in flint chipping than does this. The artist who made it manifests his ability at every step. He shows that he can embody any design of fantasy or improvisation in the way of flin chipping which his imagination suggested. This art work is not simply the chipping of flint by which the object is reduced in its proportions to a given standard, but the artist has been able to accomplish that end by chipping the flint in any way he desired. It is not in the making of a single flake that he shows his excellence, but rather that he should have been able to repeat them with exactitude as many times as he might wish. The flakes have been stricken from each edge toward the center. This has made the flakes to be about an inch long. There are about eleven of them in 6 inches of space, making each one slightly over half an inch wide. They are extremely thin, one might say ‘“‘as thin as paper,” but Naples Tlinois: they are really about as thick as @ Mie finest piece of flint chipping in the Museum. Cat, sheet of tin. So we have flakes an me er inch long, half an inch wide, and thin as tin sheets, that have been struck off consecutively, each one exactly like the other, to the number of forty-four, without a single miss-stroke or failure.
The foregoing specimen of fine art is worthy all praise for its exce:lence in flint chipping, but the next (fig. 86) is a finer specimen of art, more difficult to make, and worthy a higher admiration. It comes from the same mound as did the former and was collected by the same gentleman. It is not so large, being only 3% inches long, 14 wide, and 4 inch thick. It is of the same brown pyromachic flint as the former, but has a finer patina. The chipping being described, its excellence

Instead of the flakes being struck from each edge
toward the center, as in almost every other specimen, all of them were struck from one edge and went clear across the rounded side to the other edge. As in the case of the formér (fig. 85), it is
not the single flake that excites our admiration, but |
that it should have been repeated with precision and exactitude from one end of the implement to the other and on both sides. These flakes are about 12 inches in length, 4 inch in width, and about as thick as parchment. Fifteen of these flakes have been struck from each side
of this inplement—thirty |
in all. As in fig. 85, the artist has repeated these flakes with precision, difficult as it was, throughout the entire work. Not only was each flake like every
other, but the group of
flakes on one side of the implement correspond to the group of flakes on the other side.

Obsidian.—The art of chipping required such material as was homogeneous and would break with a clear fracture. All that did so broke with a conchoid. Obsidian possessed these qualifications. It broke with a sharp,smooth edge and a clear fracture, and was, with flint, a favorite with the prehistoric stonechipping artist. The United States National Museum possesses hundreds of cores or nuclei of obsidian and thousands of flakes which have been struck therefrom. The cores are 6 or 7 inches in length and under. Some have had flakes struck off all round, and others only part way. These flakes have all been knocked off by a blow at the top,
ach blow making a flake. There = are as many as sixteen flakes which 2 5 have been struck from a single core, = = et and this has been repeated in lesser 7 2 = numbers among many cores. The oe a difficulty of this work and the art ; 2 6 3 2
displayed in its performance is manifested by the tact that the artist was able to reproduce these cores and flakes in the large and indefinitenumberssuggested. Heseemed to be able to determine the size and weight of his hammer and manipulate the blow with sufficient force and accuracy to repeat the result any number of times, producing at his pleasure hundreds or thousands of specimens practically alike. Plate 28 represents selections of these cores and flakes. These particular specimens are from Mexico, but similar ones have been found throughout the Rocky Mountain region of the United Brates and on the Pacific Coast, and are not uncommon in every part of the world where this material is obtainable. The island of Crete is notable for the number of these objects, though they are all smail. Fig. 88 represents a large hooked implement of obsidian from Tepoxtlan, Mexico.

Its length is 174 inches, width 24, and its thickness 2 inch. It maintains the same high standard of flint chipping as shown in most of the other specimeus. Its art work is well shown in the figure.
Fig. 89 represents an obsidian blade of large size, which, for want of a better name, has been called a sword. Its length is 15 inches, width 23, and thickness 2 inch, and is from a mound in Oregon. It is an example of fine and delicate chipping, which does credit to its maker as an artist of the first-class.
Fig. 90 is a beautiful specimen of rose quartzite. Its fine grain alone rendered its manufacture possible. Quartzite is a refractory material, and it would-have been a testimonial to the ability of the artist had he made an implement, without regard to its elegance or symmetry. However, he has succeeded admirably in these points, for the implement is nearly perfect in both regards. The : flakes by which it was reduced were extremely smali, and the work proceeded little by little. The artist must have used the greatest care. No owner of this beautiful specimen would risk a single blow upon it such as must have been given a hundred or more times in the course of its manufacture.
Figs. 91 and 92 are other specimens of flint chipping, maintaining the standard for excellence in this art. The former is from Groveport, Ohio, and was collected by Mr. W. R. Limpert. The latter is also from Ohio, collected by Prof. W. K. Moorehead.
Curious forms.—Fig. 93, a, b, c, d, represent four arrowheads, introduced because of peculiarities in the fineness of their flint chipping. Fig. 93a is one of gray lustrous flint, approaching chalcedony. It belongs to Division IV, Peculiar forms, Class H, Asymmetric. This specimen, as is the next, is extremely thin, neither of them being much more than one-eighth of an inch in thickness. It comes from Santa Barbara, California, and is one of four collected by Prof. David S. Jordan. Fig. 93), also from California, is of rock crystal and is the thinnest specimen of its kind in the Museum. The chips or flakes broken from these two specimens have been extremely fine and thin, leaving the edges and points smooth and even, while keen and sharp. Fig. 93c, also asymmetric, is of gray flint, and from Chicago. Its finder was Mr. Carl Dilg, and he has named this specimen the “Riverside arrow,” Fig. 93d is presented

because of the extreme fineness of the point and the thinness of the implement. It comes from San Marcos, Texas, and was collected by Mr. H. von Beyer. It is the yellow beeswax flint common to that country.
It has been remarked many times throughout this paper that the prehistoric artist possessed sufficient confidence in his ability, and displayed such control over his tools and materials as enabled him to make anything out of flint that his fancy might dictate; he did not confine himself to utilitarian objects, but was an artist in the true sense of the word; that is to say, he dealt with art for art’s sake, for the sake of making something which should be beautiful and whose only purpose, according to the canon of art laid down by Sir John Collier, would be to please his eye and to gratify his taste. The _ prehistoric artist in flint obtained, in some way, we know not how, possibly by study and contemplation, possibly by education, possibly by accident, an ideal which he reproduced in flint. Plate 29 represents twenty objects taken at hazard from the interior of the United States, principally from the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, all of flint, in curious and rare forms, believed to be entirely without utility and solely to gratify an artistic desire. None of them are arrow or spear heads, and none of them appear to have been made for any service. They are the work of a master who, conscious of his ability, is playing with his art. One represents a bird, one a snake, one an outstretched beaver skin, two of

While the chipping of stone continued throughout the Neolithic, as it had in the Paleolithic period, there was added to it a newly discovered art by which the implement might be made smooth and sharp. This discovery was the grinding or polishing of stone implements and bringing out the beauty of their form and symmetry, showing with truth and accuracy the fine lines upon which they had been wrought, and adapting them to utilitarian objects, tools, and weapons.
The characteristic implements of the Neolithic period are the polished stone hatchets. They are found practically all over the world, showing that the Neolithic civilization must have comprised an extensive population and endured for a long period of time. The material of which these implements were made differed according to locality, but, notwithstanding all differences, their general likeness prevails throughout the world. While an experienced prehistoric archeologist may deter-

mine, from an inspection of a polished stone hatchet, from what country it comes and possibly to what locality in that country it belongs, yet the statement is true that they are substantially the same implement. The invention of the arts of grinding and polishing, together with the form of the hatchet, have been transmitted by migration or communication from people to people and from country to country; and the knowledge of the implement and the operation by which it was made descended from generation to generation and spread until it covered the five continents. A series of the polished stone hatchets from almost any one of the United States wiH stand as fair representatives of the same implement of any other country. The single exception to the universality of this statement is Scandinavia. Fig. 95 shows the flat side of a polished stone hatchet at the close of the first stage in the manufacture. The object is reduced to its general form, and in this Stage it has often been mistaken for a Paleolithic implement. Fig. 96 represents the second stage of manufacture. Here a smaller hammer (fig. 28) is used, or possibly a bone flaker; the chips or flakes removed are smaller, and, in the opinion of some archeologists, were made by

pressure instead of being struck off; the edges of the implement are made regular, the surface reduced to a level, and the entire object is made ready for polishing.
Another method, different, but similar, was employed with the nonchipable materials; that is, hammering or pecking (martelage). The same stone hammer was used, and by repeated strokes in the same place the refractory substance is gradually reduced by abrasion to the desired form.
The implement having been reduced, approximately, to the desired form by either of the foregoing methods, the next step required a grinding or polishing stone. These grinding stones are found wherever the polished-stone culture existed. They are numerous in France and England. The National Museum possesses specimens from Massachusetts
-and from Tennessee. Fig. 97 represents one of these grinding stones from the bank of the Hiawassee iver, 15 miles east of Charleston, Polk County, Tennessee. It was found by Mr. N. G. Baxter, and preWy. sented by him (through Mr. Fig. 95. Edward Palmer)to the United — warcueror runt rupety States National Museum in CHPED, FIRST STAGE, uf OF MANUFACTURE. 1882.

Fig. 98 represents the implement partially smoothed, the ridges rubbed off, and approaching completion. Fig. 99 represents the completed implement, it having been smoothed over its entire surface, Save possibly some insignificant places where the fractures of chipping were too deep to be easily ground out.

The polished stone hatchets from Scandinavia are unique. Many of them are different in form and size from those of other countries. They are larger and smoother, and have been found in such numbers in the various stages of manufacture, showing the method so admirably, and are such fine examples of art work tliat it would be improper to omit them. Plate 30 represents two of these hatchets. They are of the flint belonging to the country. Fig. a represents a hatchet chipped to form, square in section, with poll and edge indicated, and shows the process of chipping completed as indicated by fig. 96, while fig. b shows the process of grinding completed as indicated by figs. 98 and 99. Many of these implements are of large size, 16 inches in length not

being unusual. Their size, with their elegance and delicacy of chipping and grinding, so increases the difficulty of their manufacture as to take them definitely into the realm of fine art.
The frontispiece represents the method of handling these hatchets. Similar specimens have been found in almost every part of the world, though not in great plenty. The American Museum of Natural History possesses one, but the United States National Museum is the fortunate possessor of two. One of these comes from Syracuse, New York, collected by Mr. Charles M. Crounse, the other gathered by Mr. Byron E. Dodge, of Richfield, Genesee County, Michigan. Other specimens have been found in different prehistoric countries, sometimes with the handle or its fragments attached, and again with the evident marks of a

handle on the hatchet, and this method of handlin g has been accepted as that employed in prehistoric times.
These polished stone hatchets have been made with certain art characteristics locally peculiar. In Brittany the hatchets of precious stone have been made with pointed poll and a sharp ridge in the center toward the poll. Another peculiarity of the same locality is a button on the top or poll end of the hatchet. The same kind of a button appears on those from Guadeloupe and other islands of the West Indies. Those from Illinois have the edge broadened, as if in imitation of a bronze or copper hatchet which has been hammered to an edge and thus spread at the edges and corners. The same broadening at the edge appears in some of the hatchets from Chiriqui, though not to so great an extent asin Illinois. A peculiarity of some of the Chiriqui specimens is that, instead of being made round, square, or oval in section, they are hexagonal. These peculiarities are noticed on account of their apparent artistic feeling, and because they “UC™™ 0} sun seem to have had no utilitarian origin. The differ9 omen srace. ences in form have been mentioned as peculiarities, Cat. No. 99925, U.S.N.M. and so they are, for they do not apply ie to all the hatchets from their locality. They seem to have been fairly within the definition of art, being an attempt to decorate an object of utility, to make it more pleasing to the eye, and to be art for art’s sake. No decorative designs ever appear on these implements, no inscriptions, and no marks of ownership.
One must not forget that, despite all these varieties of art forms of hatchets, prehistoric man continued to make and use this general form of hatchet throughout the prehistoric world.
There has been not a little scientific discussion over the proposition that civilization travels along the line of least resistance; that man in performing sociologic, technologie, or industrial operations, does it, or endeavors to do it, in the easiest way, and with the least possi-
natcuer com. Dle exertion or expenditure of force. This is an atPLETED. tempted application of a law of physics to a condition oa ieee of sociology. It is undoubtedly a law of physics that certain, possibly all, operations of nature are conducted
along the line of least resistance. The boiler bursts at its weakest spot, the chain breaks in its weakest link. All combinations of matter are made or accomplished on the line of least resistance. The existence of the law must be admitted, but its universality as to natural things is no evidence of its application to human affairs. The condi-

<<<Page: 540>>>

tions between these two, natural and human, are so different, and there is so much dissimilarity, as to invoke different laws. A law of universal application to one may have little or no application to the other.
It may be quite true that in attaining certain results a man may proceed along the lines of least resistance—that is to say, he may seek to accomplish his purpose with the least exertion or expenditure of force.
3ut his wishes and desires interfere many times to deflect his conduct from this line. Free will, reason, and judgment are disturbing elements in man which, not found in nature, profoundly interfere with the operation of this law. They control his actions and deflect his course far from the line of the least resistance. Primitive man may have desired a knife or point for any one of the many purposes for which knives or points are used—to kill or skin his prey, to cut branches, or what not. Any sharp or pointed piece of flint, a spawl, would serve this purpose as well as the more elaborate specimens; yet we have seen that hundreds, if not thousands of times primitive man has not been content with a mere spawl, however sharp and pointed or effective it might be. Its utility alone, however perfect, did not satisfy him.
It was argued in the early part of this paper, and has been demonstrated by many illustrations, that prehistoric man had an «esthetic taste or artistic sense which controlled him equally as did utility.
The first chapter of this paper, with the arts therein elaborated, is built on this foundation. The arts of fine flint chipping, of engraving on bone, horn, and ivory, were all dependent on the cesthetic desire natural in man. The line of the least resistance, that is to say, the making of a knife or point with the least expenditure of force, would have prompted man to have used any spawl of flint or point of bone which could have been made the easiest, provided it would serve the purpose. We have seen that man did not pursue this course; that he was not contented with the rude spawl, however sharp, or the bone fragment, however pointed. His natural desire for beauty, his wsthetic taste, his artistic sense intervened and deflected his course from the utilitarian line of least exertion or resistance.
It will not do to say that the proposition of the accomplishment of results with the least expenditure of force as applied to man is devoid of truth or that it has no exceptions. This sweeping declaration would, like the swinging pendulum, carry us too far to the opposite side, and would be equally as untrue as the original proposition. The truth lies midway between the two. Man in many instances seeks to accomplish his end with the least possible expenditure. Man proceeds in most of his utilitarian projects on the lines of least resistance, and so far as utility has aided civilization there might be a foundation for this law. But art, in this regard is opposed to utility, and it deflects civilization from the lines of least resistance.
Nearly all prehistoric art work would have been avoided if the man who made the implements and objects described had proceeded on the

lines of least resistance and contented himself with the thing which was cheapest and easiest made, and would have served his utilitarian purpose. Nearly all work done by man for artistic purposes is in opposition to this law, for man’s desire for beauty, his wsthetic taste, his artistic sense, induce him to expend an infinite amount of labor in the production of an implement which would have been of equal utility without it. The fine flint chipping and the engraving on bone have been mentioned. The decorations, the great number of which are set forth in plates 13, 14, 15, 19, and 20, were not utilitarian. They were, so far as utility was concerned, a useless expenditure of force, without value, and in defiance of the law invoked.
This statement applies with equal force to many other prehistoric art works. Pottery and bronze objects were almost universally decorated ‘without regard to utility, and only to gratify the «sthetic taste. The jade implements, the polished stone hatchets, the entire list of Jorma curtosa, in fact all the ‘art for art’s sake,” and the labor expended to gratify the «esthetic taste of man and to satisfy his innate desire for beauty, were in defiance of this rule.
The foregoing argument can be upheld by many specimens, but its truth is demonstrated by the implement shown in plate 31, and its consideration in connection with the frontispiece.
The arrowand spear-head were the standard primitive projectile weapons. The ax or hatchet was the standard primitive cutting implement, performing its function by blows. The Paleolithic implements corresponding to these were made usually of flint and solely by chipping. In the Neolithic period the hatchets, while chipped or pecked into shape, were smoothed or polished by friction on a grinding or polishing stone. The various steps of the process are shown in figs. 95 to 99. These or similar implements have been found throughout the world, wherever it was occupied by Neolithic man. ‘Their method of use is shown in the frontispiece, where the original handle was found with the hatchet inserted and ready for use. The discoveries of these handles are rare, owing probably to the ease of their decomposition and destruction, but they have been found in every country associated with the hatchet in such a way as to identify their use in this manner. It has therefore been decided that the primitive man thus used them, and that practically all of the numberless polished stone hatchets found throughout the world have each one had their handle similar to that in the frontispiece. The specimen shown in plate 31, while the same implement as that in the frontispiece, differs from it in that it has a stone handle and has been worked out of the solid. Whether it was a piece of rock from a ledge or a water-worn bowlder, we have now no means of determining, for the original surface has been removed in the process of manufacture. If is hard stone, probably diorite; the material is highly refractory and does not chip or flake as does flint. It could never have been reduced eyen approximately to its present

<<<Page: 544>>>

form by chipping, as was frequently done with similar implements, especially with flint, and of which plate 30 furnishes an excellent illustration. The implement (in plate 31) was reduced to shape by grinding or rubbing and not by chipping. The grinding of an object of this size from its original condition of bowlder or ledge rock into the symmetrical weapon here shown must have required immense labor. . This work would be long, arduous, tedious, and difficult, and would require of the workman great tenacity of purpose and fearlessness of fatigue. We have no means of knowing the difference between the amount of labor required to make the implement in plate 31 and that shown in the frontispiece, but it may be surmised, for the purpose of argument, that the same amount of exertion, time, and labor expended on the latter would have made a hundred of the first. Yet the implement thus laboriously made is, for all utilitarian purposes, no better than any one of the hundred which could have been made in the sametime. Indeed, it is hardly so good, for, being of stone, it is heavier and, as the blade can not be taken out of the handle, it is more unwieldy and troublesome to carry. he only reason apparent that impelled primitive man to make this implement with an expenditure of so much more force than would have been required for the commoner specimen, was the gratification of his azsthetic taste. In order to gratify it, he was willing to expend this extra force. This implement is, therefore, an illustration of what is found to be true in thousands of other objects— that their makers were willing to endure fatigue and labor long continued, in order to gratify their desire for the beautiful. And in proportion as this is true, so did he not proceed along the lines of least resistance, but rather in defiance of the rule.
This was one of the arts of prehistoric man during the Neolithic period. It was continued into the Bronze age and thence down to historic times. It is so difficult in performance, and yet was so successfully performed, as to entitle it to a place among the fine arts. Ordinary drilling performed in a common or clumsy manner might not be entitled to such mention, and the art obtains the right to be classed as fine, only from the number of wonderful specimens which have been found, the difficulty incident to the performance, and the success attending it. Scores of examples can be given from both Europe and America in which the drilling shown is at once delicate and difficult. In America the prehistoric man desiring to make an ax made a groove around it and handled it by a withe. His European brother of the same period drilled a hole in his ax and inserted a handle after the fashion of the sledge. He appeared, in both hemispheres, to be master of the art of drilling, for, contrary to the way of the white man, he made the implement perfect and complete, even to its smoothing and q polishing, before he began to drill the hole. As said in the chapter on

<<<Page: 545>>>

flint chipping, he seems to have been able to toy with his art and perform it in any way he pleased. He drilled large holes and small, he used hard drills and soft, the latter even of pine wood. He used holow drills as well as solid, and we have cores that have been drilled from one or both sides with a straightness and evenness that seems marvelous. He was able to start his drill on the smooth and polished surface of a hard stone, apparently without any wobbling of the drill, leaving the edge of the hole as smooth and sharp as though it had been afterwards reamed or turned. The prehistoric objects found in the mounds of the United States are of even finer workmanship and more artistic than is usual in Europe.
Pipes, tubes, etc.—These objects, sometimes of hard stone, are drilled in a remarkable manner, which, when considered as the work of a savage, done without metal tools, excites our wonder and admiration. The pipes have been drilled in several directions and at different angles.
Plate 74 (in the chapter on musical instruments) represents divers stone tubes supposed to have been used as trumpets or horns, but they will serve as illustrations of the art of drilling. A certain number display this art in a high degree. The long cylindrical tubes ° do not show to the casual observer their real value as representatives of this art. Although only about 1 inch in diameter and of length varying from 6 to 12 or 14 inches, they have been drilled their entire length with a hole more than one-half their diameter, and all from one end—that is to say, the drilling of this large hole has been begun at one end of the finished tube and continued until nearly through at the other end, when the drilling (of the large hole) was stopped, the tube reversed, and drilled from the other end with a small hole which met the large one. The evidence of this manipulation is abundant, and is here treated as a fine art because of the manual dexterity required to drill accurately and continuously a large hole through so small a cylinder for such a distance without break or change of direction.
It is not intended to pursue the subject of drilling in this paper, only to call attention to its existence as a fine art and to note the delicacy and difficulty in some of the operations as shown by the specimens. The reader who is desirous of pursuing the subject further is referred to the paper on this subject by Mr. J. D. McGuire, published in the report of the United States National Museum for 1894. Many of the specimens ‘described by Mr. McGuire are from the Division of Prehistoric Archaeology.
Many ceremonial objects show fine execution in the way of stone drilling, and the subject will be continued incidentally during their description.
There were a large series of objects in use among the aborigines of

which must have greatly increased the difficulty of manufacture. It was made from a bowlder or large piece, and while the material is hard, it is not tough but rather fragile. It could not be chipped like flint nor whittled like soapstone, but must have been hammered or pecked into shape and afterwards ground to its present form, then polished until it is as smooth as glass. A consideration of the conditions demonstrates the difficulty of making this object and the dexterity and experienced working required. The United States National Museum possesses many of these specimens. — While they bear a greater resemblance to birds than anything else, — yet scarcely any two of them are alike, and they change in form through the whole gamut until it is difficult to determine whether it is a bird, a lizard, or a turtle, and finally the series ends in a straight bar — without pretense of representing any animal.
Boat-shaped objects.—Fig. 106 represents a boat-shaped object, so
called for the same reason that others were called bird shaped—because it was nearer that than anything else. There is an extensive series of
these, from those closely resembling a boat and elaborately and care fully made to those of the rudest form. They, like all the others, have — been brought to the general form by hammering or pecking and then grinding and polishing. Their purpose, also like the others, is unknown,

It has been suggested that certain of them of the plainer kind were twine twisters, handles for carrying parcels, or for tightening cords or lines. A Mohawk medicine woman declared them to be amulets or

The forms of this implement are varied. Fig. 107 represents one of — these objects apparently at the other end of the series, while there are — others of intermediate form. This one is flat, thin, not hollowed out, is narrowed in the middle and widened at the ends, and has its two holes drilled close together. Many of these objects are of hard stone, — like syenite, greenstone, etc., while a limited number are of galena, Their general purpose seems to have been as an ornament of some : kind, which, with their symmetry, execution, finish, and the difficulty — in accomplishing all these, entitles them to be classed among objects” of fine art. :

Gorgets and pendants.—These were also objects of ornament and cere| mony. Most of them are of slate, thin, not difficult to make, nor yet particularly beautiful when made. Others, however, either from their material or otherwise, become more difficult and have certain ornamentation, and should not be omitted from among decorative art — objects. The difference between the gorget and pendant seems only to have been in the number and position of the holes. A gorget might | have been fastened upon the arm as an ornament, while a pendant, unless very small, could scarcely be, though both may have been sus— pended from the neck and worn on the breast.

is introduced because of the material, which is porphyritic diabase and comes from Michigan. It has two holes and may have been worn either on the arm or the breast. No. 62578, U.S.N.M., is of soapstone, and from Tennessee. A third (No. 97423, U.S.N.M.) is of red jasper from east Tennessee. The other two are of slate and show their respective decorations. The sixth specimen of hematite, though classed as a pendant, the justification for which is the little groove around the small end apparently intended for a string or cord by which it was suspended, belongs to a class distinct from the others. They are always round, are symmetrical, and with all their hardness are made smooth and usually well polished. They have been classed as plunmets and charms, as well as pendants. Occasional specimens have a_ hole drilied through the small end instead of the groove, while others have the lower end made the same as the upper, also grooved or drilled.

manufacture, together with their use as a means of pleasure, if not of ornament, it is not improper to assign them a place here. The United States National Museum possesses an extensive series which, for some unexplained reason, extends into almost every imaginable disk form. Fig. 110 represents a side and sectional view of one of these objects of yellowish brown quartzite. It is drawn half size, and is a large and weighty object. Most of the large specimeus are of quartz, either yellow or white. They are disk form, the edges are rounded, the center on both sides has been cut out and made cup-shaped. He who could make this object, accomplishing all these requirements from an irregular piece of rude, hard quartz, and produce a specimen of such regularity of form and correctness of design must have been an artist of considerable experience. For, be it understood, that in this, as well

as in all foregoing objects, the work was done by hand, and only with the usual tools for hammering, pecking, grinding, smoothing, and polishing. It has been suggested that these may have been made with the lathe, but an investigation shows this not to have been so. Beads.—Beads of jasper are not infrequently drilled, and the United States National Museum possesses some jasper pieces of extraordinary length—for example, 3 inches—less than 2 inch in diameter, and a hole half the thickness of the bead drilled through its entire length. This hole is put exactly through the center of the cylinder, without apparent enlargement or smoothing, as though it had been drilled from one end ouly, but whether done this way or drilled from both ends the delicacy of the work and the precision with which it was done, when remembered to have been the work of a savage, is marvelous. .

LAPIDARY WoORK.
There are many specimens classed as polished stone hatchets, because of the similarity of form, material, mode of manufacture, and use; and yet, because of their rude character and rough appearance, they are not works of art. But some of these implements of hard and semiprecious stones, from purity of form, difficulty of fabrication, and their fine and beautiful finish, may be justly classed as works of art. These are mostly polished hatchets of some of the varieties of jade. Plate 34 represents a series of these magnificent implements from various prehistoric stations in western Europe.
Jade is remarkably hard and tough. The latter quality is said to be produced by the arrangement of its fibers in small interlaced bundles. It is and always has been regarded in China and the oriental countries as one of the precious stones, its hardness and the difficulty of working having conspired to greatly enhance its reputation. Except a single piece only partially determined, lately found in Austria, none of the raw material has ever been discovered in western Europe, yet prehistoric implements of this material have been found throughout western Kurope amounting to many thousands, Lake Constance, Switzerland, alone having furnished 2,000 specimens. This material and its use in prehistoric times opens many abstruse questions concerning migrations of primitive peoples and of the possible extent of their commerce. The most of these implements found in the Swiss lake dwellings are of jadeite, of which the component parts are: Silica, 58 to 60 per cent; aluminum, 22 to 26 per cent; soda, 10 to 12 per cent; with a specific gravity of 3 to 3.3. It is extremely hard, ranking 8 or 9 in the scale of which the diamond is 10.
The same material is found manutactured into implements of the most elaborate and difficult kind in great profusion in Mexico and Central America. Plate 35 shows specimens thereof. These are all in the United States National Museum. ‘heir locality, appearance, or use need not be described; it will be sufficient to say that they belong to the prehistoric period in Mexico and Central America. :
Fibrolite, still another variety of jade, is confined to southern and western France. It is composed of: Silica, 34 or 35 per cent; aluminum, 63 to 65 per cent; with a specific gravity of 3.2 to 3.3.
Actinolite, still another variety, is composed of: Silica, 0.60; magnesia, 0.21; lime, 0.14 per cent; with a specific gravity of from 3 to 3.1. Its distribution is throughout the Pueblo country of Arizona and New Mexico. ‘The specimens shown in plate 36 are these actinolite grooved axes and hammers from that locality, and belong to the National Museum.
Nephrite is still another specimen of jade, the component parts of which ~ve: Silica, 56 to 58 per cent; magnesia, 20 to 22 per cent; lime,

<<<Page: 564>>>

11 to 14 per cent; oxide of iron, 5 to 8 per cent, and aluminum, 1 to 3 per cent; with specific gravity 2.9 to 3.
A pr ofaeion of prehistoric implements, principally axes or adzes made of nephrite, have been found from the Straits of Fuca northward along the entire coast of British Columbia and the northern end of Alaska. (Plate 37.)
Pectolite is composed of: Silica, 54; lime, 33; soda, 9 per cent; with a specific gravity of 2.7 to 2.9. It is found among the Eskimos and the Indians on the northwest coast of North America. Its principal service is as a hammer, for which use it is prepared with a withe and Jashed to a wooden handle (Plate 37), and as an evidence of the almost universal art instinct of prehistoric man, this hammer, which might have been only a rough stone in every part except its face, has, despite its hardness and the difficulty and tediousness of the work, been pecked or hammered into a symmetrical form and then ground or polished to a smooth and regular surface, as though this were required for utility.
The finding of two partly worked bowlders of nephrite on the lower part of the Fraser River, at Lytton and Yale, British Columbia, respectively, and the discovery of unfinished objects in old Indian’ graves near Lytton, make it certain that the manufacture of adzes had been carried on there.
A series of specimens, numbering sixty-one in all, have been deposited in the Museum of the Geological Survey, at Ottawa, and in the Redpath Museum, MeGill College, Montreal. These consist of both nephrite and pectolite implements, as adzes, drills, axes, ete. Of the sixty one objects found, seventeen show that they have been sawed from other pieces. A prolific source of supply of this mineral in primitive times, now known as Jade Mountain, is situated about 150 miles above the mouth of the Kowak River, in Alaska. The world is indebted for the discovery of this mountain to Lieut. G. M. Stoney, United States Navy, who has brought down, and presented to the United States National Museum, quite a number of specimens. Plate 38 represents sundry of the pieces, some water-worn bowlders and fractured fragments of the material, accompanied by two or three manufactured specimens. This is the only known source of supply of this mineral in America.
Migration.—When implements are found which, upon analysis, contain the foregoing component parts and are determined to be of this mineral, it raises a fair presumption that they came from this source of Supply, and is presumptive evidence of prehistoric communication, if not migration, between the peoples. This is true only to a certain point, and is not susceptible of universal application. It does not follow that all nephrite objects came from Jade Mountain.
Jadeite is an entirely different mineral from nephrite or any of the varieties of jade, and must, or at least may, have had a different place of origin and come from a different direction.

Prof. Ff. W. Putnam presented before the American Antiquarian Society in 1886, from the Museum at Cambridge, a series of carved and sawed objects in jade from Mexico and Central America, and his theory of accounting for them was that they had been brought from Asia on the original migration of the peoples; that in after time the communications between the two countries were suspended and gradually ceased. Thus the supply of these objects was cut off, as none of that mineral having been found in that country (either then or since). They came to be regarded of great value as amulets or charms, and were sawed into pieces for a more extended distribution. That such objects belonged to these countries, and that they were divided or cut by sawing and were susceptible of a correspondingly increased distribution is a fact that can not be denied. The United States National Museum possesses series of such objects in considerable numbers. Plates 39 and 40 represent a tray of them, showing obverse and reverseThe two plates represent opposite sides of the same objects. They will be noticed further when considering lapidary work.
Dr. Heinrich Fischer, of Freiburg, Baden, supported the migration theory, alleging the great similarity between the Mexican and Central American jadeites and those in Burmah. Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, attacked the migration theory fiercely and maintained the greater probability of the indigenous character of the mineral. Professors Clarke and Merrill, of the United States National Museum, published a paper! on ‘“‘Nephrite and Jadeite.” It consisted largely of chemical and microscopical investigations and determined with great certainty the substantial differences between the minerals. Their conclusions, so far as relates to the migration theory, are as follows:
That these substances are comparatively common constituents of metamorphic rocks, and hence liable to be found anywhere where these rocks occur. ‘Their presence (in any given place) is as meaningless (so far as concerns the migration theory) as would be the finding of a piece of graphite. Their discovery (among prehistoric peoples) possesses no value in the work of tracing the migration or intercommunication of races.
It is not possible to determine this jade question positively or absolutely. We do not possess sufficient knowledge to solve it finally. Whatever may be at present determined is subject to a reversal by a discovery which may be made at any time in the future. If a jadeite mountain should be found in Mexico or Central America as a nephrite mountain has been in Alaska, it would settle the question at once, but until a ledge or quarry of jadeite shall be found in America the question must be left in abeyance. The discovery of the place of origin of jadeite in America may never be found, and consequently the question may never be absolutely solved.
Various efforts have been made to discover jadeite in its natural deposit in Mexico and Central America, but never yet with success.

The latest effort was that made by Mr. A. Sjogren, a learned Scandinavian geologist interested in prehistoric anthropolgy, acquainted with the importance of the “jade question,” and always on the lookout for any evidence that would shed light thereon. He resided for a time in Costa Rica, with full opportunity for the investigation of and acquaintance with the jadeite objects in that country. During his visit there he made more or less extensive searches for the evidence of indigenous jade. He found a number of pebbles the appearance of which suggested that they might be the desired material. On his return to his native country he stopped at Washington, and, visiting the United States National Museum, he invoked the aid of Professor Merrill, Curator of Geology and Mineralogy, and the author, as Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology, who opened the cases in his department and produced implements from Costa Rica and the neighboring countries for comparison with the specimens Ltrought by Mr. Sjogren. The result was that eight specimens of pebbles were selected as having the greatest similarity with the material of the jade implements, and it was proposed to put them to test of microscopic investigation. Professor Merrill accordingly made thin sections of these for that purpose, and has just Neaties the result of his investigations. He says:
Nos. 1, 3, and 8 are without doubt an altered pumiceous tuffa, identical with No.
59899, bia by Professor Clarke and myself in our paper in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, Vol. x1, page 127.
This specimen (No. 59899, U.S.N.M.) was from San Huacas, Costa Rica, dark green, not mottled, soft, specific gravity 2.282, and its composition as follows:

A microscopic examination shows that the mineral is evidently a highly altered volcanic tuff, but very difficult to make out. The mass of the rock is made up of a greenish-gray amphorous felt, through which are scattered round bunches of a bright-green chlorite and small, colorless points and elongated crystals, which may be felspathic, although they are too small to show twin striz. There are also occasional colorless elongated and curved shreds, which are yoo without action in polarized light, and which are doubtless glass.
He continues as to the Sjogren specimens:
Nos. 2, 4,5, and 7 are highly siliceous rocks of rather obscure nature, but consisting largely of chalcedonic silica, and if not true chalcedonic secretions, are at least very compact fragmental rocks that have been acted upon by silica-bearing solutions. No. 7 shows occasional minute circular areas with concentric structure,

<<<Page: 575>>>

which are doubtiess silicified remains of foraminifera, such as are not infrequent in siliceous nodules found in limestone. ‘There is nothing in the series in the least resembling true nephrite or jadeite.
The concluding sentence leaves the discovery of the origin of jade material, of which the Costa Rica prehistoric implements were made, as much an unsolved problem as ever. But negative results from the searches of an experienced geologist made on the spot are of more value than has been generally admitted, and the thanks of prehistoric anthropologists are due to Mr. Sjogren for his interest and efforts. It is certainly remarkable that, with the thousands of prehistoric implements from Mexico and Central America, no specimens of the natural material has ever been found in any of filewe countries.
There are other views which seem to narrow the question of jade migration, if they do not elucidate it. It would appear highly improbable that any such migration of peoples could have been made by land between the place of origin in Burmah and the place of its discovery in Mexico and Central America. We can scarcely conceive of a migration, comprised of however great or small numbers, which would start from Burmah overland by way of Bering Straits for Mexico and Central America, carrying with them such small implements and in such great numbers. If they did, these implements would run great risks of being lost. Arrived in Alaska, the emigrants ought to have found some traces or specimens of the nephrite, wrought or unwrought, of which we now find so many. One or two hypotheses force themselves upon us: The emigrants (from Burmah) might have left some of their own jadeite implements in Alaska or obtained some of the nephrite. No traces have been found of either. Then these emigrants would have started on their southwestern trip, a distance of several thousand miles, to Mexico, without leaving anywhere any trace of jadeite implements. Arrived at Mexico, and thence on through Central America, are to be found implements, all of jadeite, by the thousand, but none of nephrite. If these emigrants traveled by land from Burmah to Mexico, crossing at Bering Straits, it would involve a long and necessarily tedious journey. In Alaska these emigrants would enter a country where there was a mountain of this precious mineral, the prehistoric inhabitants of which well knew how to make it into implements. No other implements or objects, of this or similar material, have been found along the indicated route which would serve as extraneous evidence of such migration.
The foregoing argument seems satisfactory to the author against a migration of jade or jade implements by land from Burmah to Mexico or Central America. This leaves only the ocean as a means of migration, and that such a journey should have been voluntarily made across such an ocean seems almost incredible. It would appear, in view of the diifficulties and obstacles to such journeys or migrations, either by land or sea, that the only course left to deal with the jade question is to await further developments and discoveries.

<<<Page: 576>>>

It is not intended in this paper to pursue the question of jade from a mineralogic or an archieologic point of view. Anyone desiring to do so is referred to the works of Professors Meyer, of Dresden; Fischer, of Freiburg; Damour, of Paris; ‘“Nephrite and Jadeite,” by Professors Clarke and Merrill;! “‘The Occurrence of Jade in British Columbia,”? by Dr. Dawson, and to “Gems and Precious Stones,”* by Mr. George F. Kunz, it being the intention of the author to confine his discussion to the art side of the question; and from this side he refers with approbation to the forthcoming edition de luxe of the volume on jade by Mr. H. R. Bishop, of New York City.
Mr. Kunz, the gem expert with Tiffany & Co., in his work, “Gems and Precious Stones,” speaks of the ancient lapidary work as follows:
The chipping of an arrow point, the grinding and polishing of a groove in an ax head, the drilling of a bead or tube or an ear ornament, all are done by the application of the same lapidarian methods that are practiced to-day by cutters of agates or precious stones. The cutter of to-day, with a hammer, chips into shape the erystal or piece of agate before it is ground; and there is little difference between the ancient method of drilling and that of the present. The stone bead of ancient time was drilled from both ends, the drill holes often overlapping or not meeting as neatly as by the modern method of drilling from one end.
The old way of drilling is still practiced in the east, where the primitive bow drill is used by lapidaries to-day precisely as it has been used by savage tribes in all quarters of the globe, though producing at different periods different qualities of work. Nowhere was its use better uhderstood than in ancient Greece and Rome, where, by its means, were engraved the wonderful intaglio and cameos which now grace our museums, and which have never been surpassed in any period of the world’s history. For the special use of gem engraving, the bow drill has been replaced by a horizontal lathe, which, however, does not allow the freedom of touch or deftness of feeling which artists attained by use of the bow drill. The instrument known as the dental drill is really an improved form of bow drill, working much more rapidly. An 8.8. White dental engine, provided with a suitable series of drill points, answers every purpose, and has been found especially useful in exposing fossils and minerals when covered with rock, the objects being opened with great rapidity, with little danger of injury. . As shown by the author in a paper on a new method of engraving cameos and intaglios,® an artist could be so trained to the use of this improved bow drill as to attain the same softness and feeling developed by the old lapidarian masters.
In the ancient specimens of work, tubes from which a core has been drilled out by means of areed and sand, revolved by the hand, were done as neatly as anything can be done, the reason being that the object was entirely drilled from end to end. This method of drilling is still practiced, except that the hollow reed is replaced by the diamond or steel drill. When a valuable stone is being drilled, a sheet of steel or thin iron tube is substituted for it. The polishing and grinding now is done on rapidly revolving disks, horizontal or lay wheels, as they are called, whereas formerly the slow process of rubbing with the hand or board or leather was perhaps resorted to. No lapidary can do finer work than that shown by the obsidian objects

from Mexico (see illustration), the labrets,' ear ornaments, and tubes,? which are even more highly polished, though no portion of the latter is thicker than onethirty-second of aninch. An obsidian coyote head? in the Blake collection in the United States National Museum is a beautiful ornament, highly polished, and bored throughout the lower part. The spear points and hoes from East St. Louis and other parts of Missouri and Illinois, and beautiful sacrificial knives—notably the immense knife,* 18 inches in length, in the Blake collection of the United States National Museum, and the one in the Ethnological Museum at the Trocadero in Paris—show the greatest skill in chipping.
Many of the aboriginal stone objects found in North America and elsewhere are marvels of lapidarian skill in chipping, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Few lapidaries could duplicate the arrow points of obsidian from New Mexico, or those of jasper, agate, agatized wood, and other minerals found along the Willamette River, Oregon. No lapidary could drill a hard stone object truer than some of the banner stones,® tubes, and other objects made of quartz, greenstone, and granite that have been found in North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, or make anything more graceful in form and general outline than are some of the quartz discoidal stones® found im these same States. These latter objects are often 4 to 6 inches, and occasionally 7 inches, in diameter, ground in the center until they are of the thinness of paper and almost transparent, and the great regularity of the two sides would almost suggest that they had been turned in the lathe. This may have been accomplished by mounting a log in the side of a tree so that it would revolve, and cementing the stones with pitch to the end of the log, as a lapidary would do to-day at Oberstein, Germany, or by allowing the shaft of the lathe to protrude through the side of the log, and cementing the stone to be turned on this. The Egyptian wood turner at work in the Rue de Caire, at the World’s Fair, Paris, 1889, might, with his lathe, polish a large ornament of jade or jadeite, like the masks, idols, tablets, and other objects found in Mexico and Central America, or the jade knives from Alaska, in the United States National Museum.
Jadeite masks.—Returning to the discussion of lapidary art as manifested in the working of hard stone, plate 41 shows examples of different materials, form, uses, and localities, though all from Mexico or Central America; some specimens are obsidian, and no distinction is maintained as to the material of the others.
Fig. 111 is a mask of jadeite from an Aztec (?) grave in Mexico. It represents a crying baby. It belongs to Mr.Charles Storrs, of Brooklyn, and was exhibited at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1879, by Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith. It is reported as having a specific gravity of 3.3, which, with its hardness, determines it to be jadeite. Remarking upon its art, we first see how it has been wrought by drilling and other methods of abrasion into, not simply a representation of the human face, but that it has its peculiar expression. The eyes are closed, the brows are drawn down, the nose and upper lip are drawn up, deep furrows are in the cheeks under the eyes and by the side of the nose, the contour is regular, the profile is correct and true, and besides all this, every portion of the face has been not only smoothed, but finely polished, the depths and sides of the furrows and around the eyes equally well with that of the prominent parts like the cheeks and forehead. Suggestions are made as to how some of this

was accomplished, for example, at the corners of the mouth, where the depressions were made by drilling, although the drill marks have been polished out. One is able to speak of this drilling operation with a certainty that becomes absolute, from finding it represented in a score of other specimens, wherein the corners of the eyes and mouth have. been drilled, some with a solid, others with a hollow drill, the latter showing the protuberance of the core. Specimens have been found where such drilling had been utilized for the insertion of precious or colored stones. The unscientific reader will appreciate the beauty of this specimen as well as the difficulties to be overcome, when it is stated that with this and many others of the specimens herein men-

tioned one can, without any preparation and without undue pressure, cut the glass in the cases which contain them with apparently as much ease as does the glazier with his diamond. In fact, the material stands next in hardness after the diamond. It is 9 in the scale of which the diamond is 10. These remarks in regard to hardness, drilling, and polishing apply to many of the specimens shown in plates 39, 40 and 41. There are specimens of hard stones not jade which show evidence of fine lapidary art.
Crystal skull.—Fig. 112 represents a human skull of rock crystal. Its hardness is well known. The sutures are shown, the hollow eyes are drilled out, the nose with its processes is shown, and the grinning teeth. A hole has been drilled through from the crown to the foramen

magnum. Other objects in rock crystal treated in a similar manner have been found, of which Mr. Kunz is authority for the statement that the workmanship equals anything done by the modern lapidary. Similar skulls are to be seen in the Trocadero Museum at Paris and in the Douglass collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Central Park, New York. A unique specimen remarkable for its size, from the Boban collection and found in Mexico, is now owned by Mr. George H. Sisson, of New York. It is 8,5 inches in length, 53 inches in width, and 51; inches in height, and represents a human skull similar in appearance and workmanship to fig. 112. A deseription of one would stand for a description of the other.

a number of these implements from various parts of the American continent, and an examination verifies the fact and extends the area of their discovery over a much larger portion of the United States. Plate 42 represents two of these implements now in the possession of the United States National Museum in addition to the one received from Captain Aldrich. The best finished one! is of the Standard shape, Size, and appearance, and a reproduction of the Aldrich Specimen, as well as many of those from the Pacific coast, from Mexico, and almost all the finished ones from New Zealand, would be but a repetition of this. It is therefore considered useless to duplicate the representation,
The history of the specimen (No. 1300) is given by Mr. J. D. McGuire, the present owner, as follows:
It was given to me by a gentleman who had lived long in the West. ‘The story he told me was, that while on a hunting trip (I think in California, though of this I am not positive) a companion who had left camp in the morning returned with the implement in his hand and said he had found two dead Ute Indians, and to the wrist of one was attached this stone by the piece of cord yet on it.
A specimen from the State of Washington is shown on plate 42 (Cat. No. 172565, U.S.N.M. It was found by Mr. R. H. Hannah, 3 miles east of Olympia, while clearing the ground of Stumps. The attention of the author being attracted to the subject, he discovered that the number of Specimens found within the United States similar to those in plate 42, especially those like No. : 172565, U.S.N.M., has increased considerably and nan Bee seas their geographic area greatly extended.

This art work may not be manifest upon a curSale sory exainination, but it must be considered that many or most of these Specimens are some of the varieties of jade, with a hardness equal to that of glass and exceeded only by the diamond, and that they are made straight, true, entirely symmetrical both sidewise and edgewise, with rarely a flaw or defect, and that when thus reduced to form they are smoothed and polished as finely as a piece of jewelry intended for a lady’s wear.

geometric designs, and representations of living or real objects were rarely attempted. A series of Neolithic ornamentation is shown in plates 19 and 20. These are mostly on pottery, only four being on stone and to be classed as sculpture. There seem to have been two geographic areas in France affecting this kind of art, the first around the Bay of Quiberon, department of Morbihan, the second in the department of the Marne, northern central France.
The four specimens referred to are all from the first-mentioned area, “They are on plate 20, figs. — 16, 21, 23, and on plate 19, fig. 1559
Plate 19, fig. 15, represents the — sculpturing on one of the supports of the dolmen of Petit-Mont, at Arzon, The principal designs or — lines are in waves and U-shaped. — The only one which could have ~ been intended to represent any known or possible object are two _ human footprints, and these do q not appear to signify anything — more than is apparent. Plate 20, — fig, 23, represents a cartouche, engraved or sculptured on a support of the dolmen of Pierres-Plates at Lochmariaker, Morbihan. Plate 20, fig. 21, is a representation of one of the supporting stones of — the dolmen of Gavr’Inis. The author has visited this dolmen and has seen the sculptured stones in place. They are thin sandstone — Slabs, about 6 feet high, 4 feet wide, and form the sides of both the crypt and the entrance, there being probably forty in all, similar in many respects to that shown in the figure, although this has been chosen as the best representative. — The surface is rough; the sculpturing has been done with the hammer by pecking or battering—martelage, the French call it. Plate 20, fig. 10, is a representation of the covering stone of the dolmen at Baker Hill, Rosshire, Scotland, taken from “Archeic Sculpturings,” by Mr. J. Y. Simpson. These will be perceived at once to consist principally of cup stones, some with concentric rings, others connected by a slight

groove. ‘To go into the subject of cup stones as a branch of sculpture would lead us too far afield.’
Other dolmens have been found with marks made thereon, but no meaning is aseribed to them beyond possibly that of a stone hatchet handled, or some similar implement. Fig. 119 isarepresentation of one of these stone hatchets handled, engraved on the sixth support of the dolmen of Gavr’{nis. Various petroglyphs have been found on the dolmens in the immediate neighborhood—Tables-des-Marchands, ManéHWréeck, Kercado, Petit-Mont, Mein-Drein, Be-er-Groah; also on the dolmens of Grosse Perrotte (Charente), and Trou-aux-Anglais (Seine-et-Oise).

In none of these sculptures has there ever been an attempted representation of living things, except in the few cases mentioned. This statement would have been true for all France until within a few years past, but because of recent discoveries it requires modification. There have been found on some of the stone supports or tables of the dolmens, rude and apparently inchoate or malformed figures which, by assembly and comparison, are decided by investigating archeologists to have been representations of the human form. Baron Joseph de Baye and M. Adrien de Mortillet have been the most ardent and successful investigators in this regard, though MM. Cartailhac and Reinach should not be forgotten. Fig. 120 represents one of these supports of a dolmen in the department of Marne. Fig. 121 is another from the same department.*
These are believed to have been the earliest prehistoric sculptures in stone or on stone monuments In France. They were bas-reliefs on the

supports of the dolmens in the Grottos of Coizard in the valley of PetitMorin (Marne).
Similar rude sculptures have been found in other parts of France, which have been collated by M. Cartailhac in the work above eited, which collation has been extended in his description of the sculptures of the dolmen d’Epone (Seine-et-Oise).'
The collation of sculptures of the human form was continued by M. Solomon Reinach.? It is not deemed necessary to here enlarge on the subject in greater detail. Those interested can follow it in the authorities cited.
Plate 43 represents four of a series of eight discovered by Abbe Hermet and drawn and described by M. Cartailhac.’ The figures are the best of the series and have the nearest approach to human beings. Some have legs and feet represented below the girdle, but shorter, narrower, straighter, and closer together, until it becomes an even chance whether they may not have been intended to represent the fringed ends of a scarf. M. Gabriel de Mortillet has reported and figured by photograph the same statues.‘
M. Solomon Reinach figures and describes the same,’ and says: “I find it inexplicable that these should ever have been qualified as Neolithic. The accessories which distinguish them can respond only to an origin in the time of metal, probably of bronze.”
Other sculptures near Paris are reported by M. Adrien de Mortillet.®
Aboriginal sculptures in North America are quite different from those of Europe. The Neolithic peoples of the United States, whether North American Indians or their ancestors or predecessors, made many pieces of sculpture in stone, wood, or pottery, representing animal as well as human faces and forms. Most of these were rude, though they sometimes presented the subject in a bold and marked manner.
In stone.—The sculptures in stone exhibited a skill in art inferior to that displayed in flint chipping, drilling, and polishing. The ordinary decoration of objects was not, as in Europe, confined to geometric designs. It appears as though the aboriginal American artist gave his fancy or imagination free rein, was not hampered by rules of art nor deterred from the most daring attempts by any imaginary mechanical or technical difficulty. It is true that he made designs by sculpturing on flat surfaces, sometimes on stone, but many more times on pottery. Still, on numerous occasions he essayed the highest flights of

art, and sought to represent the human form as well as the face, by sculptures done in the round.
Plate 44 represents a human figure sculptured in stone. Its height is 214 inches, and its weight 56 pounds. It is complete and perfect, without a break or damage. It was found near Stilesboro, Bartow County, Georgia. It is seated, the legs are represented in the solid stone as though crossed, but in an impossible manner, not being more than one-third the length of the arms. The only indications of sex are the mamme, which are small dots, indicating the male. The material is fine-grained sandstone, and the entire figure has been worked out of the solid. It has apparently been done altogether by battering or pecking into form and then rubbed or scraped smooth. It is not polished. The shape of the head and the general appearance of the features are typical, to a degree at least, of the aboriginal art throughout the southern United States. The head rounded over the top of the skull, broad across the middle, with projecting ears; the eyebrows are prominent but madeso by the sunken eyes. The eyes are oval, and their orbits on the same plane. The nose is straight, without much appearance of nostrils. The chin is short and rounded, the under jaw very small. The most noticeable characteristic of this specimen, as it is of many others from the same region, and that which would seem more than anything else a local type of human sculpture, is the mouth and the mode of treating it. The mouth is open, being represented principally by a ‘avity which has been excavated to a considerable profundity. The lips are strong and protrude greatly. They are not divided into upper and lower lips, but are continuous around the orifice so as to form an oval ring, the interior of which is the cavity representing the mouth. Neither the teeth nor the tongue are shown, though a ridge in this specimen might pass for teeth or gums. The neck is fairly well formed ; the shoulders are square, but with the arms, are considerably exaggerated in size. The body under the armpits is less than half the width across the shoulders. From the armpits to the legs the body is a solid cylindrical mass of stone, without indication of thorax, waist, or abdomen. The hands and arms, especially the former, are extremely rude, the fingers being only indicated by scratches. The head as is represented, was thrown well back, the chin being somewhat in the air. The upper part of the face as well as the forehead, retreated considerably; the head was short (brachycephalic), though this might have resulted from the action of the artist without being any indication of race. The occiput was furnished with a knot 34 inches in diameter and 13 inches elevation. This might represent lair, although there is nothing particular to indicate it. The statue has none of the fillet, as it is called by Professor Thomas, which communicates from the back of the head downward.

covered in a cave near Strawberry Plains, 16 miles east of Knoxville, Tennessee. The body is rudimentary. The face is fairly well represented and shows the two peculiarities of the sculptures of that southern region, that is, the retreating forehead and the ring-like mouth.
Fig. 123 represents two views, back and front, of a rude sculpture of the female figure. It is of yellowish sandstone, is from Williamson County, Tennessee, and is about 8 inches high. Like the former specimen, the body and head are rude, being little more than indicated.
a The mamme show it to have been intended for a
female figure. The arms are only indicated on the
stone and are not separated from the body. The
figure is seated or kneeling, the hands upon the
knees. The spinal column is prominently indi-
eated. There is the same sloping face and re-
treating forehead, with the ring-mouth as before remarked.
Fig. 124 is another representation of a female figure, 15 inches high, of yellowish sandstone, from the same locality (Williamson County, Tennessee). The body is much better represented than the former, and as a work of art is more complete and better finished. The figure is kneeling with the hands crossed and pressing — against the abdomen. The occiput is provided with a knot through which is a perforation, as though for suspension, although its actual use is unknown.

Though reported to have been made of stone, the photographs from which these figures were made was a clay model or plaster cast, and the eyes and nose differ widely from the stone images of that locality, being almost exactly like those made of clay and which abound on the pottery bowls and bottle vases.

The mammary glands are sharply defined and maidenly in their appearance. The ears, hand, and navel are rudely formed. The impression conveyed is that of a dead, young, flat-head Indian woman. Unfortunately the left arm has been broken off, but otherwise this idol is in a state of remarkable preservation.
It appears, also, from Colonel Jones, that another statue in the possession of Colonel Tumlin, in 1859, had been plowed up near the same mound. Colonel Jones reported that he saw it, and he gives the following description 2
It was of coarse dark sandstone, and it was 12 inches high. It consisted of a male figure in a sitting posture. The knees
were drawn up almost on a level with the chin, the hands resting upon and clasping either knee. The chin and forehead
were retreating, the hair gathered into a knot behind, the face upturned, and the eyes angular. Unfortunately this image was lost or destroyed during Sherman’s march through Georgia in 1864.

The right leg is brought forward, the foot being flat upon the ground, the knee in its natural position, the right arm and body resting on it. All this forms a base by means of which the statue can sit alone. The face is round, moon-like, the eyes much the same, giving it a wild and staring expression. The nose is prominent, but broad and flat, while the lips are protruding and heavy. The workmanship is crude, and it seems doubtful if it was ever intended as a portrait bust or to represent any particular individual or tribe. The entire statue has been wrought out of the solid, and apparently no part of the original surface was ever utilized. It has peculiarities of physiognomy, different from the ordi. nary appearance of the Indian, and resembles the negro, yet the ensemble of the statue bears no relation to the negro. The appearance of the face resembles somewhat the Perrine statue from Union County, Tllinois, made in pottery and represented in fig. 132.
A much mutilated and defaced statue of sandstone was found in a mound in Tennessee and deposited in the United States National Museum by Dr. John E. Younglove, of Bowling Green, Kentucky. The lower part is broken, and its original condition is unknown. Enough of it remains to show the shape of the head, the indication of the hair, the breadth of the face, and that all these are of the same type as the examples from the same locality. The ears are well represented, and are much more elaborate than in any specimen yet examined. This head, if taken alone, would have every appearance of being a bowlder, the surface of which had been sculptured as shown, but an examination of the head, taken in connection with the shoulders and breast, shows that it has been worked out of a larger piece. The fracture, both of the trunk and that by which the nose and mouth was destroyed, was ancient, and the broken surface appears to be equally as old as any of the sculptured portion. (Cat. No. 141015, U.S.N.M.)
This statue is peculiar in its appearance and unlike those from the Southern States; the only one bearing any similarity to it which has come to the notice of the author is that shown by Thruston.'
Other specimens from the region of Tennessee and Kentucky are in private and State or municipal collections in the States mentioned, but enough has been shown to indicate a particular style of sculpture or a certain sameness in its production. Whether this arises from a peculiarity of the artists in that they were all taught one way, or had

adopted a given style, or whether the individuals represented were alike and had, in fact, the peculiarities of form and feature depicted by the sculptor, is unknown. A critical and extended examination and comparison might furnish means for determination.
The localities where these sculptured peculiarities belong are principally through the southern tier of States, extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.
In pottery.—It is now proposed to investigate sculpturing, or perhaps the better term is modeling, in pottery. These specimens belong to the same general locality as the stone statues, except that the former seem to cross the Mississippi River and extend to the north into Missouri and Illinois. The first to claim our attention, because of their peculiarity and rarity, are the head-shaped vases or death masks principally from Arkansas. (Plates 48, 49, figs. 129, 130.) Professor Holmes,! speaking of these vases, says:
Up to the present time , which represents a specimen recently exhumed at Pecan Point by agents of the Bureauof Ethnology. In size, form, color, finish, modeling of features, and expression this head closely resembles the one first described. The work is not quite so carefully executed, and the head has probably not such pronounced individuality. The curious device that in the other examples appeared near the left eye here occurs on both sides. The lower part of the face is elaborately engraved. Three lines cross the upper lip and cheeks, reaching to the ear, a band of fret-like devices extend across the mouth to the base of the ears, and another band filled in with oblique reticulated lines passes around the chin and along the jaws. The ears are perforated as in the other case, and the septum of the nose is partially broken away as if it had once held aring. A perforated knob has occupied the top of the forehead as in the other case. The face is coated with a light yellowish-gray slip, and the remainder of the surface is red.
Mr. F. 8S. Dellenbaugh, who combines the archeologist with the artist, has published? some observations and conclusions concerning this specimen (plate 48, fig.2). He begins his paper with the declaration, vonceded as true, that the North American aborigines have not been successful in depicting the human face. It might be added that they have been no more successful in depicting the human form. He then declares that the excellence of these two or three specimens is far beyond the ability of the aboriginal sculptor as shown in all other specimens, and gives it as his opinion that these were death masks.
Soft clay was pressed upon the dead features, and when sufficiently dry it was removed and other soft clay thinly pressed into the mold obtained. The mask thus made was built upon until the jar was completed.
He declares Mr. Holmes’s theory of a free-hand sculpture to have been an impossibility. He thinks it to have been taken in the manner suggested from ‘‘a young redskin somewhat distorted by disease and death. The age might be anywhere from 10 to 16, if a male, and 14 to 20 if a female.” He is of opinion (again differing from Mr. Holmes) that the perforations through the knob on the forehead, and those in
'Some of the tribes on the Northwest Coast have a custom of perforating the rim of the ear in a manner Similar in appearance to these. Strands of red woolen yarn are drawn in and tied, which hang almost to the waist. Models of these are in the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park, New York. It is not suggested that there was any relation between the two.

the rims of the ear, were intended for suspension. He gives comparative measurements of one of these vases with two white boys, a white man and woman, and shows the general accuracy of size, form, and feature.
Plate 49, figs. 1, 2, represents two of these head-shaped vases, one of which appears to be a death mask and the other not. They belong to the Morris collection, and were on display at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition, Nashville, 1897, where the author obtained a photograph. Fig, 127 a, b, represents a head-shaped vase, front and profile views, believed to be a death mask. It was found by Mr. C. W. Riggs while excavating a mound on the St. Francis River, Arkansas. The features are represented in a natural manner, such as is not known in free-hand sculpture. The decorations of the face, like the foregoing illustrations, have been done after the withdrawal of the clay from the mould. The

eyes have been slightly opened, the.nostrils and teeth are represented by incisions impossible to have been made before, and the same is true with the decorations on the cheeks and with the ears. Fig. 128 is a head-shaped vase, not a death mask, of the red pottery of Arkansas. It was obtained from a mound in the vicinity of Little Rock, and forms part of the collection of Mr. Thibault. The United States National Museum possesses another head-shaped vase (Cat. No. 91299) similar to fig. 128 but still smaller.
These head-shaped vases divide themselves into two distinct groups. The specimens forming the first group are deaths masks, as becomes more and more evident the more the objects are studied; the other group, while of the same general form as the first, the human head being represented, has the face and features wrought upon it free hand, as in sculpturing, without the aid of a mold or cast. The author does

<<<Page: 611>>>

not pretend to any special knowledge on this subject, but believes that a comparison between these two groups will show the correctness of these conclusions.
The next to be noticed are from the same general locality, and are what have been called “effigy bottles.” Professor Holmes! makes the following observations concerning them:
These aboriginal potters dealt with the human figure in a bold manner for savages. They were evidently capable of representing many creatures with accuracy, but preferred grotesque or con| ventional forms. Aman or a woman is generally modeled with a large body and a curious hunched back, the vertebre appearing along the prominent ridge. The shoulder blades are usually shown with anatomic distinctness, if not with precision; the arms are long and slender, and the hands rest upon the knees or sides. The position assumed is mostly that of kneeling or squatting, the feet being doubled up beneath and united . with the bottom of the vessel. These effigy vases are numerous and greatly vary in size and color. They Fig. 128. are mostly of the dark red, HEAD-SHAPED VASE. or in red and white figures, some of which represent

The knees, calves, ankles,

Fig. 129 represents an effigy vase from Arkansas. The general position of the body will be understood by an inspection of the figure. The mouth of the bottle is at the back of the head. One is to remark the peculiar representation of the face and features, and their similarity with some of those already described. The head is thrown back as in the foregoing, the chin is in air, while the features, nose, eyes, and mouth are much the same. Fig. 130 represents another effigy bottle, also from Arkansas, bearing the same peculiarities. Both these have the retreating forehead, the round face, broad and high cheek bones, the framing of hair around the edge of the forehead—in fact so great a similarity in all these little things as to indicate the same

style of art and the same method of representing the human face and form.
Plates 50 and 51 are further representations of the human face and form in these effigy bottles. They all come from Tennessee, and show the various styles of bottles and types of the pottery sculptures of the human face. The human form is not supposed in these to be accurately represented, but is highly conventionalized in order to accommodate itself to the utilitarian purpose of the bottle. These all come from stone eraves in Tennessee, and most of them from the neighborhood of Nashville, and are represented one-third actual size.
Another style of pottery vessel belonging to the same geographic area, though extending farther north, is the bowl with a handle representing a human or animalform. One of these (fig. 131, two views) was dug from a mound in Marshall County, lowa. Although the face is erotesque, the nose being exaggerated, yet it bears the family resem-

blance; the head is thrown back, chin in air, retreating forehead, the high cheek bones, the eyes and mouth made in the same way as the other pottery effigies, and generally the similarities are such as to identify them with the same style of art.
The author has avoided, so far as possible, any reproduction from Professor Holmes’s work on Art in Pottery, and itis not intended to go into this subject. The foregoing have been introduced in order to call attention to the peculiarities of the human face throughout this geographic area, whether in stone or on pottery. Many other examples might be cited and copied if required.
We now pass to a different style of sculpture, still aboriginal, but belonging to a different geographie area, the center of which might be indicated generally as Illinois. Fig. 132 represents a statue taken from

a mound in Union County, Illinois, by Mr. T. M. Perrine. The figure, like many shown, occupied a sitting posture, the base being flat so that the statue will sit alone. It differs from many of the foregoing in several respects. The right knee is drawn up to the chin so that the foot is placed flat upon the ground; the forehead is receding or retreating, but the head is not thrown back and the chin is not in the air. While the face is round, yet it is not round as are the others. The high cheek bones and great breadth across the middle of the face so noticeable in the former are absent in this. The roll of hair around the top of the head is differently managed. But the greatest differences are in the features. The forehead is not flat either way, but, on the contrary, is quite well rounded; the eyebrows are not cut out, producing a ridge across the face, as in the former specimens; the bridge of the nose is on the same plane as the forehead; the eyes, nose, and lips differ in style and mode of making and, in fact, they represent an individual in such a different light as that one might easily suppose it belonged to a different race from the former. The eyelids are well developed, the eyeball is well rounded, and the pupil is prominent. The nose and mouth are heavy and thick, and, without having any relation to the negro race, they are far from representing the aquiline nose and thin lips in the former figures.

A glance is sufficient to show the similarity in appearance of the two individuals here represented, and their dissimilarity with the two geographic groups heretofore described. The shape of the forehead, nose, lips, chin, indeed of every feature in both statues, is noticeably different from the others. The expression of the mouths and chins of these two are slightly different from each other, but this might have arisen from want of skill of the artist. There is nothing of the flator dish-faced appearance, so prominent in the southern group, nor is there anything of the round or moon-

faced appearance in the second group. The forehead is reasonably high, and while retreating or receding, it is not on the plane of the face, as in the southern and other groups.
Fig. 153 is a east of a pipe from Ohio. Whether it represents the same style as the immediate foregoing or not, it is introduced by reason. of its similarity and possible relation. The mouth is similar to thosein former representations. It is shown as widely open and deeply excavated. The eyes are represented by excavations only, but the forehead and face are the same general type as those in Plate 52, from New Jersey and Staten Island. The nose and lips are mutilated beyond recognition, except that the root of the former is shown broad and not

thin or pinched. The eyes are different from either of the former groups, and the cheek bones, while high and prominent, have a different contour. This is largely produced by the sunken cheeks, which are not Shown in either of the former groups.
No argument is sought to be made that there were different races of aborigines, because of the similarities of the sculptures of the same group or the dissimilarities between the different groups. The author has no intention to do more than note and present the various styles of sculpture, leaving the ethnologic results and conclusions to be worked out at a future time.
Bronze head (Louvre).—A curious and unique piece of bronze sculpture (Plate 53) having a possible relation to the North American Indian, belongs to the Gallery of the Louvre, Paris. But little is known of its history. It formed part of the collection of Edmund Durand, which

the King, Charles X, purchased for the Louvre in 1825. Its peculiari ties were first noticed by M. Adrien de Longperier.' The same article was reproduced in his work.’ This bronze is classed as No. 826, in the catalogue of the Museum.’ It is thus described:
Bust of a slave whose head and face are entirely shaved. The cars are large and hanging. The top of the skull opens by means of a hinge, which is attached to a cover. Above the ears are placed on either side rings in which are adjusted a swinging handle, which represents a branch or twig with buds.
It is first to be remarked that the object is what was called a Roman situla, being a bucket, jug, or kettle, which might be used as shown, for carrying liquids. This style of object is essentially Roman, and from it and the general appearance of the object, its patine, etc., it was the opinion of M. de Cueleneer, professor of the university at Ghent, by whom my attention was first called to it, that the object belonged, or could be assigned to, the century before the Christian era.
The author once lived in Ghent, where he was acquainted with M. de Cueleneer, who has been twice in Washington, and during his visit to the National Museum became much interested in the Catlin Gallery of Indian Portraits, of which the United States National Museum published a catalogue filling the entire report of the year 1885. The author procured a copy of this report for M. de Cueleneer, who has used it with good effect in his notice of the bronze situla now under consideration.
It was his opinion, although this bronze piece was made probably in Italy during the first century prior to the Christian era, that it represented, or may have represented, a red Indian from America. In support of this contention he presented about a dozen figures of Indian heads, taken principally from the National Museum Catalogue of the Catlin Gallery; and he called special attention to the similarity ofthe anatomical and somatologic characteristics and peculiarities represented in both. He says of the bronze head that the skull is dolichoeephalic, the forehead is retreating, the ears are large and low and the lobes adherent, the eyebrows are strongly arched, the nose is aquiline, the angles of the mouth are turned up and the lips large, the under jaw is rounded, the occiput is protuberant. The discovery of this bronze attorded M. de Longperier in a partial, and M. de Cueleneer in a complete manner, the opportunity to correlate and explain certain fragments of notes by Cornelius Nepos which seemed to have always troubled and disconcerted commentators. He speaks of the “Indian slaves” as having been cast away by the sea on the coast of Germany. These fragmentary notes of Cornelius Nepos have been preserved by Pomponius Mela and by Pliny, the naturalist.

Pomponius Mela says:!
Testum autem rei, Quintum Metellum Celerem adicit, eumque ita rettulisse commemorat: cum Galliz proconsule pracessit, Indos quosdum a rege Botorum dono sibi datos; unde in eas terras devenissent requirendo cognosse, vi tempestatum ex

Pliny records the same fact as follows: ?

or of the Sueves) made a present to Quintius Metellus Celeri of an Indian or Indians, who, having been cast away at sea, were stranded on the coast of Germany. M. de Cueleneer, in his paper, “Type d’Indien du Nouveau Monde Kepresenté sur un Bronze Antique du Louvre” (1890), goes profoundly into this branch of the subject, shows who Metellus was, where, and at what epoch he was in command, and how he might have received from one of the barbarian kings or tribes a present of slaves, which might have been Indian castaways from the coast of North America. He then recites the discovery of the bronze situla in the Louvre, and by an examination of its workmanship and appearance coneludes it was made in Italy during the first century before the Christian era, and from its great resemblance to the red race of America, as represented in the Catlin Gallery, he concludes the chances are favorable for it having been a sculptural representation of a North American Indian.

Fig. 136 is a cast in the United States National Museum of a sculptured stone representing a human face and head in profile, discovered in 1863-64 near St. George, Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada. The stone on which this sculpture was made is 214 inches high by 184 inches wide and 2 inches thick. It is granulite, distinguished from granite proper by the absence of mica.
Plate 54 represents the sculptured statues of two stone lions, crouching, carved by aboriginal artists. They are cut out of the solid outerépping rock, supposed to have been done with obsidian knives, but this has not been verified.

Masks.—Not infrequently aborigi_ nal sculptures have been found, some among the savages of the United States, but in greater numbers in Mexico, which have been _ called masks, being made of flat and comparatively thin stone with human features sculptured thereon.

This has no signification and is not worthy of consideration, for this group of mounds has furnished the copper and shell objects noted by Prof. W. H. Holmes in the Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, quoted in my paper on ‘‘The Swastika,” and described at length in the report of Professor Thomas.' Professor Thomas says that in all their leading features these designs are suggestive of Mexican or Central American work.
Some of the Mexican sculptures were deseribed in the paragraphs on jade. Masks and sculpture in stone from Mexico are here continued.
Fig. 143 represents a typical Mexican mask of greenish mottled feldspathic stone, and is 54 inches long. Its back is slightly concave and the mouth and eyes have been excavated by drilling, as can be seen in the corners. It is finely polished throughout its entire surface. The holes in the edges by which it could be fastened are shown. Dr. Rau gave as his opinion that these masks were used for covering the faces of idols on certain occasions.
Figs. 144 and 145 are specimens from Mexico representing the human form.

Squier and Davis, Dr. Rau, Abbott’s “Primitive Industry,” Jones’s “ Antiquities of the Southern Indians,” Thruston’s “ Antiquities of Tennessee,” and similar works contain these representations in greater or less numbers. A few specimens of animal forms were not utilized as pipes, but it is entirely uncertain whether they were not unfinished specimens intended for pipes.

A peculiar class of these tablets of intaglio scuplturing are those represented in figs. 146 and 147.

A careful study of this complicated design shows it to be formed on the same principle as those carved on bones. Not only is the duplication of the right and left sides apparent, but there is also a remarkable duplication of the different parts when they are reversed, the right and left and the upper and lower. This is shown in the reduced outlines given in fig. 16, of which a shows the human figure as in fig.

in the art museum of that city. The sculptured figures on this tablet are in low relief, resembling somewhat those on the “ Cincinnati tablet.” (Fig. 146.) his similarity is recognizable at a glance. The work is so much alike that they might have been done by the same artist, but the figures in outline and character are so different as to seriously affect the theory of the symbolism and duplicate representation of man and serpent. There is in this, apparently, neither head, mouth, body, nor extremities, which have been so elaborately and ingeniously discovered and described in connection with the former tablet. | Footprints.—A_ peculiar and as yet unexplained series of stone sculpturings have been found in the territories now forming the United States,and which are believed to be unique among its aborigines. These are sculptured footprints, and they have given rise to much speculation and discussion.

After stone, pottery came into the greatest use in prehistoric times. It has peculiar interest to us in that it was the material which lent itself most readily to art purposes, and again from its gréat resistance to the ravages of time. The manifestation of art on pottery in the way of decoration could be perpetuated, not only from its enduring character, but when broken into fragments the decoration would not be lost. The greatest number of patterns and art motifs of prehistoric times throughout the Eastern Hemisphere have been perpetuated in the fragments of pottery.

Neolithic.—It has been contended that pottery was not employed in western Europe during the Paleolithic period. ‘The consensus of opinion is in favor of the existence of pottery during this period in some portions of Europe, while it did not exist in other portions. Some of the caverns of Belgium, which have otherwise yielded no objects but such as are identified with the Paleolithic period, still have yielded fragments of pottery. There is in the museum at Brussels, Belgium, a
vase almost entire, reconstructed from the fragments found in one of these caves. But there is continually the question of intrusion and subsequent occupation. It is the definite opinion of M. de Mortillet that no evidence has been discovered of the use of pottery in France or England during the Paleolithic period. During the Neolithie period and the Bronze age, pottery abounded throughout western Europe, and it is now found in quantities in nearly all localities oecupied by prehistoric man in these ages.
There is considerable yariation between the potteries of different localities; difference in material, some being coarser, others finer, and in shape or form, and in decoration.
The northwest coast 1 Re

ancient province of Britcottected by Captain Little, U.S. A. Cat. No. 7637, U.S.N.M. § natural size tany, seems to have pro-
duced the finest pottery after that of Denmark; while that of the central and sonthern parts of France and of England seems to have been coarser and ruder. It is no purpose of this paper to describe the making of pottery, but one may say that in all this prehistoric period the pottery vases were made without the use of the wheel or furnace. All evidence points to the introduction of the latter into western Europe from Greece through Etruria and Rome. It was not until the Roman conquest of Fratrce and England that these countries were affected by the knowledge of the wheel and furnace, and this can be carried a step farther, for within the memory of living men this knowledge had not been spread throughout the British islands. In northern Scotland and among the Orkneys and Hebrides islands the rude household pottery

is made in the same manner as in prehistoric times, and apparently this knowledge had descended from generation to generation unaffected by outside influences. The theory has been put forth that prehistoric pottery was hardened by exposure to the sun. While exposure to the sun might harden it sufficiently to maintain its form and to hold substances of little weight and no moisture, yet for the ordinary uses of pottery the hardening by the sun is insufficient, and it is believed that all pieces and fragments of prehistoric times were burnt.
These prehistoric vases were for the most part rounded at the bottom and unable to sit alone. The suggestion is made, by way of explanation, that they were suspended over the fire, and anything in the way of a bottom as a base or legs wouid interfere with this, and therefore the bottoms were rounded.
The form most affected throughout western Europe for pottery vases was that called the tulip. It was the commonest in Brittany, where the material was the finest; but it was also used in England, in Hanover, Bohemia, Hungary, Sicily, and in Portugal. Plate 55 represents two vases of the tulip form, with characteristic ornamentation, from southeastern France. They were found in a dolmen in the neighborhood of the little hamlet of St. Vallier, in the department of AlpesMaritimes, where the author spent a summer in archeological researches.

pottery vases in various European countries during the Neolithic period. The style of decoration has been shown in plates 19 and 20, and need not be further treated here.
Bronze age.—The pottery of the Bronze age was not materially different from that of the Neolithic period. There is, to be sure, a certain change of form; all specimens seem to have been smaller. There are a great number of cups, dishes, plates, etc. The paste is finer, the walls are thinner, and the decoration, while of the same general style, is a continuation of the lines, dots, and curves arranged in geometric form. They are, however, made lighter and closer together, giving the ornamentation a finer and more artistic air. With these exceptions, the pottery of the Bronze age was much the same as that of the Neolithic period.

Canon Greenwell, in his work on British Barrows,' speaking of the prehistoric pottery found therein, says:
The most common forms of ornament are alternate series of parallel horizontal and vertical lines (like heraldic compone, if it were engraved as of gules and azure) ; now and then in a double series (as counter compone); triangles set in rows (or, rather, what heralds call a dancette line of partition), the triangular space formed being filled with parallel diagonal lines, which have a different direction in each alternate space (like alternate representations of heraldic purpure and vert); rows of round or oval impressions encircling the urn; lines forming a reticulated pattern; lines placed herring bone fashion, or in a zigzag. The lines are often made by impressions of twisted thong or cord, but sometimes are drawn on the clay with a sharp-pointed instrument. In some rare cases raised ribs occur in the rim .
Many of the designs on plates 19 and 20 are taken from Canon Greenwell’s book, and are such as here described.
The first material change in pottery in France and England was possibly brought from Etruria. The next was by the importation of the Samian or Aretine ware brought by the Romans. This pottery was thick, heavy, hard, resisting all ravages of time, and, except for breakage, the specimens now found are as perfect as they were originally. It was of finer paste, still not made with the wheel, but in molds. The ornamentation was in relief, being usually on the outside, the soft paste having been pressed into the mold. Most of these specimens were brought to western Hurope by the Romans themselves, though.it is Supposed they were made there during the long period of Roman occupation.
Grecian, Etruscan, and Roman pottery were all different from anything more modern. The knowledge of their manufacture has been lost, and all these kinds of pottery have become extinct. They are almost prehistoric, but because of the localities wherein they have been found, and the objects with which they were associated, they have come to be placed under the head of Classic, rather than Prehistoric, Archwology. The works on that subject should be consulted by any one desirous of pursuing the study.
Neolithic.—Without attempting a discussion of the differences of the culture status of the Neolithic period in the country occupied by the North American savage, and other countries of the Pueblos, Mexico, Central and South America, it is sufficient to say that there certainly were great differences in the pottery manufactured by the respective peoples of these countries. The southern potteries are so different and So superior to those of the peoples to the north that it would require a volume to do them justice. All present attempts will be confined to northern Neolithic peoples. '

oughly into the subject of the pottery of this country, and reference is made to the numerous papers he has published.' Anyone desiring to examine the subject in detail is respectfully referred thereto. This paper deals only with art, and consequently only with form and designs
of decoration. In his paper on “The ancient pottery of the Mississippi Valley’” he epitomizes the propositions, thus:
Form.—This ware exhibits a great variety of form, many of which are extremely pleasing. In this respect it is far superior to the other prehistoric groups of the eastern United States. The shapes are as varied and elegant as those of the ancient Pueblo pottery, but are inferior to those of Mexico, Central America, and Peru. * * *
Finish.—The finish, as compared with the work of civilized nations, is rude. The surface is often simply hand or trowel smoothed. Generally, however, it was more or less carefully polished by rubbing with an implement of stone, shell, bone, or other suitable substance, the markings of these tools being distinctly visible. Nothing resembling a glaze has been found on pieces known to be ancient. The surface was sometimes washed or coated with a slip or film of fine clay, which facilitated the polishing, and in very many cases a coat of thick red ocher was applied.
Ornament.—The ancient potter of the middle province has taken especial delight in the embellishment of his wares, and the devices used are various and interesting. They include, first, fanciful modifications of form; second, relief ornament; third, intaglio figures, and fourth, designs in color. :
Modification of shape.—It can hardly be claimed that the ancient peoples of this region had a very refined appreciation of elegance of outline, yet the simple, essential forms of cups and pots were by no means satisfactory to them. There are many modifications of shape that indicate a taste for higher types of beauty and a constant attempt to realize tuem. The esthetic sentiment was considerably developed.
There is also a decided tendency toward the grotesque. ‘To such an extreme have the dictates of fancy been followed in this respect, that utility, the true office of the utensil, has often taken a secondary place, although it is never lost sight of entirely. Bowls have been fashioned into the shapes of birds, fishes, and reptiles, and vases and bottles into a multitude of animal and vegetable forms without apparent regard to convenience. All of these modifications of essential forms were doubtless looked upon asin a sense ornamental. So far as I can determine they were in no case intended to be humorous.
Relief ornament.—Decorative ideas of a purely conventional character are often worked out in both low and salient relief. This is generally accomplished by the addition of nodes and fillets of clay to the plain surface of the vessel. Fillets are applied in various ways over the body, forming horizontal, oblique, and vertical

bands or ribs. When placed about the base or rim, these fillets are often indented with the finger or an implement in a way to imitate rudely a heavy twisted cord—a feature evidently borrowed from basketry. Nodes are likewise attached in various ways to the neck and body of the vessel. In some cases the entire surface of the larger versel is varied by pinching up small bits of the clay between the nails of the finger and thumb. An implement is sometimes used to produce a similar result.
Intaglio design.—The wsthetic tendencies of these potters are well shown by their essays in engraving. They worked with points upon both plastic and the sun-dried clay, as well as at times upon the fire-baked surface. Figures thus produced exhibit a wide range of artistic achievement. They illustrate all stages of progress, from the most archaic type of ornament—the use of dots and straight lines—to the most elegant combinations of curves, and finally to the delineation of forms and fanciful conceptions.
Generally, when a blunt implement is employed, the line is produced by a movement that I shall eal! trailing, in contradistinction to incision, in which a sharp point is used, and excision or excavation, which is more easily accomplished with the end of a hollow reed or bone. Impressed or stamped ornament is of rare occurrence, and anything like repoussée work is practically unknown. The practice of impressing cords and fabrics was common among many of the northern tribes, and nets have been used in the manufacture and ornamentation of vases at many points within this province. Stamps especially prepared were in use in most of the Gulf States and to a limited extent in northern localities.
Designs in color.—The colors used in painting are white, red, brown, and black, and have generally consisted of thick, opaque, clayey paste, white or colored with ochers. Occasionally the colors used seem to have been mere stains. All were probably laid on with coarse brushes of hair, feathers, or vegetable fiber. The figures are in most cases simple, and are applied in broad, bold lines, indicative of a strong talent for decoration. The forms are to a great extent curvilinear, and embrace meanders, scrolls, circles, and combinations and groupings of curved lines in great variety. Of rectilinear forms, lozenges, guilloches, zigzags, and checkers are best known.
The decided prevalence of curved form is worthy of remark. With all their fertility of invention the inhabitants of this valley seem never to have achieved the rectangular links meander, or anything more nearly approaching it than the current scroll or the rectangular guilloche, while other peoples, such as the Pueblos of the Southwest and the ancient nations of Mexico and Peru, found in it a chief resource.
Mr. C. C. Willoughby, of the Peabody Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, has published in the Journal of American Folk-Lore ! “An Analysis of the Decorations upon Pottery from the Mississippi Valley.” It consists of 12 pages, with 21 figures, and represents the different motifs said to have been employed in the decorations upon pottery from the locality indicated. The similarities alleged are not always perceptible and the arguments based thereon are not always logical, but great latitude is permissible in such subjects.
It is not the intention of the author to attempt any description of the antiquity, origin, technology, or industry of the prehistoric people during the Bronze age. This would carry us into the realms of archieology, while we have been confining ourselves to art. A few preliminary words emiay, ees be useful.

There appears to have been a gap or hiatus between the Paleolithic peoples and the Neolithic peoples in their occupation of western Europe. There certainly were vast differences between their respective cultures, and it has been believed there was a solution of the continuity of occupation in western Europe between these two epochs.!
Since the discoveries of Judge Piette? in sundry caverns of southern and western France; of MM. Boule and Cartailhae * in the Grotto of Reilhae (Lot), and the observations of M. Solomon Reinach* on the “Femme nue,” discovered in the caverns of Mentone by M. Julien, the hiatus between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods has been controverted, and is not now regarded nearly so certain as formerly.
The contrary appears between the Neolithic and Bronze ages, at least — for western Europe, where the introduction of bronze and its subsequent use for weapons and implements seems to have occurred among — the same peoples. The advent of bronze for these purposes was by immigration or introduction from some other country, and the peoples (still in western Europe) who used it this year probably were the same as used the stone implements last year. Therefore the introduction — of bronze, while it made changes in their implements and so wrought changes in their mechanical ability, yet had comparatively small influence upon their art.
We have already shown the differences between the art of the Paleolithic period and that of the Neolithic period; we have also shown how, in the Neolithic period, the art was confined to the merest decorations of objects, and that it consisted principally of geometric designs. Plates 19 and 20 are again referred to as giving an extended representation of the kinds and styles of ornamentation employed.
The decorative art of the Bronze age was but a continuation of that of the Neolithic period, and it is not impossible that an investigation into the origin of some of the specimens in plates 19 and 20 would show) them to have belonged to the Bronze age; that is to say, the styles of ornamentation of the two periods or ages were practically the same, and the latter was but a continuation of the former, with such possible) changes or additions as would naturally grow. The marked difference: between the two ages was the substitution of bronze for stone in the: material for cutting and piercing implements. |
The question continually arises whence and how was bronze introduced into western Europe. Of course the answer is lost in antiquity, for there are no records. There is not, and from the nature of the case there can not be, any direct or positive testimony. We can depend only upon the evidence furnished by prehistoric archeology. Many theories have been propounded, none of which have proved

entirely acceptable. The most general one is that bronze came from the far Hast, probably from the countries around the Straits of Malacca, and that it belonged to a period relating to the early Aryan dispersions. Bronze is one of the great epoch-making discoveries, greater than that of iron, and as a practical agent of prehistoric civilization, equaled only by the bow and arrow.
The discovery of the fusion of copper and tin, both comparatively soft metals, in the proportions of 90 and 10 per cent, making a new metal, harder than any other then known, capable of being cast, and when cast capable of being made sharp and holding a cutting edge, was a great step in human culture, and calculated to revolutionize the destiny of the human race.
Plates 57 and 58 represent the art work done on various weapons and implements of bronze. Plate 57 represents sword handles, while plate 58 represents principally knives and scabbards. Articles of dress and for personal adornment, like bracelets, fibula torques or ceintures, and similar objects, were made of bronze. These need not be displayed, for they all bear the same general style or type of art decoration. These will show that the decoration consisted principally of geometric designs, and will demonstrate the similarity of the decoration and art work in the Bronze age to that of the Neolithic period.
The Bronze age had no existence in the Western Hemisphere during prehistoric times. All objects of bronze found among the aborigines are believed to have come from Europe.
Many objects of wrought copper have been found in America. The Lake Superior copper mines in the States of Wisconsin and Michigan appear to have been the center of manufacture, from which the distribution took place, and thence the manufactured implements spread, in gradually decreasing numbers, in every direction throughout the present territory of the eastern United States. The modes of treating copper, whether by smelting, melting, casting, or hammering, and if any or all of these, what amount of heating or melting was done, has never been fully investigated nor have they been satisfactorily determined. Some of the objects were certainly of virgin copper hammered cold, and they were thus made into bracelets, rings, and similar objects of personal adornment, and also into axes, knives, and spearheads. These copper weapons and ornaments continued to be used contemporaneously with cutting implements of stone and of ornaments of shell and bone.
The author is well aware of the contention that there was in Europe a Copper age intermediate between the Neolithic and Bronze ages, and he has visited and examined the national collection in the city of Berne, Switzerland, which contains the greatest proportion of copper

objects, and has furnished the principal basis for the argument of the existence there of a Copper age. No argument upon this or any similar question is attempted. The only proposition here presented is that copper was used in the neighborhood of Lake Superior to make cutting implements of similar form to those of stone, and that, despite the numbers of such implements found, copper did not change the culture of the peoples; it did not establish a Copper age as bronze established a Bronze age in Europe; it was not an epoch-making discovery or invention, and the mode of making and using stone implements by chipping and polishing, as in the purely Neolithic age, was not superseded by the discovery of copper.
Among the many mysteries of prehistoric archeology growing out of mound excavation in the United States, wherein things strange and wonderful but of undoubted genuineness and antiquity are found, none are more unexplained than the thin sheets of copper wrought by repoussé work into curious and unknown devices found in mounds and earthworks in widely separated regions of the country.
Etowah plates.—The principal specimens come from the Tumlin mounds on the Etowah River, near Cartersville, Georgia (Plates 59, 60), They have been figured in the reports of the Bureau of Ethnology! and in the author’s. paper on “The Swastika.”? Of these specimens the principal comment made by Professor Thomas is in approval of that of Professor Holmes,’ that “in all their leading features the designs themselves are suggestive of Mexican or Central American work.” Yet he adds that—
There are one or two features which are anomalous in Mexican or Central American designs, as, for example, where the wings are represented as rising from the back of the shoulders. The two plates area combination of Mexican and Central American designs, the graceful limbs and the ornaments of the arms, legs, waist, and top of the head arefCentral American, and the rest, with the exception, possibly, of what is carried in the right hand, are Mexican.
Professor Thomas continues:
That these plates are not wholly the work of the Indians inhabiting the southern section of the United States, is admitted; that they were not made by an aboriginal artisan of Central America or Mexico of ante-Columbian times, I think is probable, if not from the designs themselves, from the apparent evidence that the work was done in part with hard metallic tools.
To the latter conclusion the author does not agree. The proposition may be true, but there is no evidence of it.

Hopewell mound art.—The Hopewell mound, near Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio, was excavated by Prof. Warren K. Moorehead for the benefit of the Department of Ethnology at the World’s Columbian Exposition, Chieago. It was an immense construction, 530 feet long, 250 feet wide, witb an original height of 32 feet, but when opened was only 16 or 18 feet to its original foundation. A considerable number of elaborately wrought copper objects were found at or near the bottom of the mound and in the center. Plate 61 represents most of these. All were flat, thin, smooth, though not polished, and had been cut into the various designs as represented. One

horns was entirely covered with thin
sheet copper neatly and artistically ©
placed so as to have the appearance of solid copper, and it was not until after a considerable examination that their real character was detected. The antlers were 22 inches high and 19 inches across the upper points. Plate 63 represents another object of a similar type from the
same mound; it also is a copper head —
dress with two short rounded horns springing from the top as shown. They
were also covered, but the copper had —
been broken from the top of the two

ology. Many aboriginal carvings and engravings on bone were fouud during their excavation. Figs. 951-253 in “The Swastika”! represent variously carved birds and animals from these mounds. Other specimens were found, mostly in fragments, of which Mr. Bennett, the artist of the expedition, says:
These carved traceries or engravings upon bone, even in fragmentary state, evince an artistic aptitude much beyond the mineral and vegetable stain, and, by their almost microscopic delicacy of execution and unfaltering precision of line work, show a high degree of manual skill. Though some are undoubtedly portions of barbaric and ‘desultory design and unsystematic application of indefinite ideas, others bespeak a clearly conceived idea, a definite motive and vigorous execution, not inferior to the predominant motives of early Mediterranean decorative art.
They are clearly not of an illustrative or imitative design, either realistic or conventional, but created design, founded on purely mechanical motive with good conception; and it is regrettable that no complete examples remain to correct artistic valuation of the purpose of the whole.’

Moore in the Florida sand mounds brought to light several of these thin copper plates with curious designs wrought upon them.’ The United States National Museum possesses a number from various States in the ee central United States.

They do not represent human or animal figures, but tend to lines, dots, concentric rings, and designs more or less geometric.

Prehistoric archeologists have had their attention directed to these precious metals, and accordingly have sought for them when excavating prehistoric settlements. 1t is not intended in this paper tog ve a full or even reasonably complete list or dese: ption of finds of gold or silver.

Brittany.—The use of gold can be traced in western France through the Neolithic period, principally in the form of collars and bracelets. Fig. 155 represents one of these collars. It was found in one of the dolmens of Roc’h-Guyon or Rondessec, at Plonharnel-Carnac (Morbihan). The discoverer was M. Lebail, the keeper of the hotel at Plouharnel, where the author spent some months at various times in prehistoric investigations, visiting this monument upon sundry occasions. The ornament is native gold, about an inch and a half in width, and cut longitudinally into a dozen strips extending one-third the way round. This might have been done by a sharp flint, used chisel and not saw fashion. There were two of these collars, each weighing about 140 grams. They had been intentionally deposited in a rude pottery vase with cinders, ashes, and charcoal, which had been walled up in one corner of the chamber.

While it is not asserted that the working of gold was carried on
in the Neolithic period, yet the foregoing patterns are different from most of those of the Bronze age. Many, apparently belonging to the Bronze age, are: simply reund rods or bars of gold of sufficient length to encircle the wrist, and which have been bent to that form (fig. 157). Others have been made into thin sheets, crimped around the edges (fig. 158). Both these

is a Series of bracelets, running from extremely large to extremely small. They consist of a rod of gold, larger in the center, tapering gradually to the ends, but with a head hammered down and spread, the ends being then brought more or less together (fig. 161). In the larger of these the rod would be nigh half an inch thick, and from thatdown. Someare large enough to go over the hand and so be worn on the wrist, or even on the arm, while the smaller ones in tle series would not go on the little finger.
with which they were associated coneur in their assignment to the Bronze age. There are also many objects in gold—torques and bracelets—which show a different method of working, and are> supposed to have been of later date. Some were round, heavy, decorated, marked with zigzag, herringbone, chevron, ete. (fig. 159, a, b), some of them after the fashion of a coil of rope (fig. 160, a, d), in others the ends were hammered square and enlarged (fig. 160, b, ¢).

rings, and the additional fact that in some of the countries on the west coast of Africa manillas somewhat resembling these have been used as currency, has caused it to be said that these were not bracelets, but — were money, and the name of ring money has been given to them. It is evident that these latter specimens belong to later prehistoric peoples. In Ireland these have been called Celtic; in France, Gaulish. Laissegraisse.—Fig. 162 represents one of these Gaulish torques or collars, while fig. 163 represents a bracelet. They are both of the same style, and were found about 1885 in the little hamlet of Laissegraisse, department of Tarn, France, by a peasant while digging in his vineyard. The author happened at that time to be in the city of Toulouse, and accepted the kind offer of M. Cartailhac to visit the locality and inspect the objects. They were found at about 18 inches beneath the surface, just below the ordinary reach of plow or mattock, and it was only an

extraordinary and accidental stroke of the latter that showed a brilliant spot at the bottom of the hole. There were evidences of prehistoric mau in the shape of flints more or less worked, fragments of pottery and bits of charcoal, but none had any particular relation to the gold objects. They were not protected by box or inclosure in any way. It will be seen from their work that they had been highly decorated, made in repoussé, and soldered together. The details of the ornaments (fig. 164, a, b,c) and the mode of fastening (fig. 165, a, b, c) evince a fair degree of civilized mechanical skill in their execution.
Golden cinctures have been lately (1893) found at Coutras, and are now in the Museum of Bordeaux. They are simply twisted coils with large button-like ends. Industrially they resemble those from Laissegraisse, but artistically, they are much inferior. They were found en cache, forming part of the stock of a goldsmith or a mint worker, comprising about four hundred pieces, weighing nigh 10,000 franes in gold.

The manufacture and use of gold ornaments continued in these two countries, Ireland and France, to a much later date. An inspection of the beautiful objects of precious metals in the museum at Dublin will show the Celtic work improving in
and artistic design until 1000 or 1200 A.D. Mr. Edmund Johnson, an accomplished jeweler aud goldsmith in Dublin, made a reasonably complete series of reproductions of these ob-

Musicisa dualism. It is formed of the conjunction of two elements; the one purely musical, the other poetical; the one sensuous, the other spiritual or intellectual; the one owing its origin and development to instruments and based on the mere animal delight in sound, the other owing its origin and development to language and based on the fusion of the emotional and intellectual sides of man’s nature.? ~
It has been asserted that the origin of vocal music was coeval with that of language, and that the construction of musical instruments dates with the earliest inventions suggested by human ingenuity. Those who make these assertions do so simply upon theory, and when pressed for their authority would be compelled to admit that actual knowledge or information upon the subject does not exist. What can be affirmed is that sound made by the prehistoric man of the earliest epoch might have been rhythmic and so possessed one of the elements of music. The other elements—melody, dynamics, and harmony—followed in the course of civilization, among some people at a faster and among others at a slower rate.
Vocal sounds are incapable in themselves of perpetuation. When the vibrations made by the human voice have ceased, the incident is closed and the evidence lost. It is, therefore. in the absence of any written testimony, impossible to identify the practice, or even the existence, of vocal music in prehistoric times. We are driven to an exclusive consideration of musical instruments, and if these should fail us, we would be without evidence.
Miss Fletcher * says:
As to the birth of musical instruments, I can not even touch upon the raison d’étre of their invention, but I may call attention to their controlling influence; they have become at length master of the man who made them. There is no race or people possessing a theory of music who have not been indebted to musical instruments for the means by which their theory has been worked out. * * * Before the instrument had been evolved and man could listen objectively to his music, during the long period when his voice was his only mode of expression, his mind was not stimulated to make observations upon the relations of one to the other. He may be said
to have possessed no conscious method and to have followed no known or accepted artificial rules of composition of his song.
This relates entirely to prehistoric times, and its author accepts musical instruments as the only means of perpetuating the sounds so they can be reproduced and studied.
‘Much of the material descriptive of prehistoric musical instruments and their scales in the Western Hemisphere contained in this chapter was prepared by Mr. kK. P. Upham, assistant in the division of Prehistoric Archaeology to whom credit as joint author should be given.

It is the intention in this chapter to leave aside all speculation as to the origin, theory, practice, philosophy, and poetry of music, and to deal only with musie as one of the fine arts of prehistoric times; the study thereof to be based upon such knowledge as is obtainable from prehistoric musical instruments.
There have been some students, even some professors, who, wiser than their own generation, declare music to be a manifestation of an innate principle in man. The author does not contradict the proposition, but he denies the knowledge and authority of these wise men who Say so.
While the proposition may be true, yet the statement is valueless, because it is only the assertion of these gentlemen, the truth of which they do not know. I¢is, on their part, theoretical, and an assumption which should be proved before being stated as a fact. It is a@ priori argument, and as such is vicious. Investigation has demonstrated that similar assumptions have been erroneous. Illustrations of this can be shown in the life history of Paleolithic man, deduced from discovery. No person would be justified in the assumption, without proof, that the man who lived in caves and apparently had no more notion of civilization than the wild beasts with which he disputed the possession thereof, who knew only to use stone implements, and these made sharp by chipping, and who did not know to rub one stone against another to make it either smooth or sharp—no person would be justified in assuming that this man was capable of making artistic designs representing almost the entire fauna of his district; yet in an earlier portion of this paper we have seen that he did this thing. It has been said or assumed, without knowledge for foundation, that man in his earliest condition had an appreciation of the rhythmic character of music; but, in opposition to this, we will show that this same Paleolithic man, who developed an artistic taste in such high degree, had no taste for and did not employ even the rhythmic principle of music. The most we have found of his ability in this direction was the simple whistle, made from the phalange of the reindeer (p. 524). While it is not impossible that this might have been used in cadence and for rhythmic representation, yet there is no known fact on which to base the belief. No reason has been given, and I take it no reason can be given, for these manifestations on the part of the early man in favor of one kind of art and not of another kind. This becomes less subject to the a priori theory herein denounced when we consider that to a large extent the contrary appears in the higher civilization of the Neolithic period, which follows the Paleolithie.
The object of this paragraph is to protest against the a priori method of arguinent so often used by the student or professor who, studying or knowing the instincts or capabilities of modern man, argues therefrom that man in a state of nature did the same. It is not denied

<<<Page: 689>>>

that one people may have developed its culture in one direction and not in another, even retrograded in some respects while they advanced in others, but no person is justified in assuming that, because one primitive people developed their civilization in a particular direction, therefore all peoples did the same. The unity of human development and civilization isa myth. We have but to look over the modern world and to compare the peoples of historic times, some of them of high civilization, to demonstrate this want of unity. It is sufficient as an illustration to cite the different families of the Aryan race, which originally had a single stock of language if they did not havea single stock of blood; then compare these families together and note the differences in their civilization, the Greeks with the Romans, and they with the Celts, and the Celts with the Goths, and so on to the Lets and the Slavs, and all these with the Zends and Persians. If this comparison be somewhat difficult and not apparent at a glance, we may take the descendants of these various peoples as they exist at the present time; compare not simply the Latins with the Germanic peoples, but the Latins with themselves; the differences between Italy and France, and of France with Spain, or the ancient Saxon with the Anglo-Saxon of England. These differences are almost as great as though there never had been any relation between them; almost as great as it is between these Aryan peoples and the Semitic, between whom there has never been any racial relation. These differences apply to their fundamental civilization and ramify through every fiber of the respective bodies politic. In sociology the distinctions in religion, marriage, government, law, inheritance, is as great between Italy, France, and Spain on the one hand, and Germany, Holland, and England on the other, as it is between either or all these and the same institutions in China and Japan. He would be a poor historian who, proceeding upon the theory of the similarity of human nature, and having written a history of any one of the nations and peoples just mentioned, should assume that, therefore, he was in possession of knowledge of the sociologic conditions of any other. It is useless to continue this argument. Its only purpose has been to enter a protest against this method of reasoning when applied to the prehistoric peoples of whom our only knowledge consists of such monuments, tombs, residence sites, implements, utensils, and objects as have been or may be found on or in the earth.
Rhythm was the first element of music. The drum and the rattle of the savage give forth but one tone, and all their music consists in strokes or shakes, repeated at greater or less intervals of time and with more or less regularity and force. The earliest prehistoric whistles gave but a single note, but were afterwards increased to two and five notes, and while they could increase the force they were scarcely able to make a melody except of the most simple kind. Drums and rattles

might have had a different pitch and have given different notes, but there is nothing to show that they were intentionally so. It is much more probable that they were made to produce tones of strength, clearness, sweetness, ete. When prehistoric man understood and attempted to make melody he had advanced one grade in culture.
Frequent attempts have been made to give written representations of the rude music heard among savage or barbarous nations, but these should always be received with distrust, not somuch from want of confidence in the observers as from want of accurate representation of sounds heard. The usual practice is to try to write the sounds according to our modern musical notation, but it must be borne in mind that this notation only corresponds with our own peculiar scale, which has no signs to represent other sounds. Hence, when we see the chants of a savage tribe expressed in our notation we should not take it for granted that they actually used the intervals of our scale. Wecan only assume that the observer wrote something as nearly like what he heard as he could find means of expression.
In the music of savage tribes they used a few sounds, differing in pitch, but in most cases there is no sufficient reason to believe that these sounds correspond, as regards their gradations, with any regular musical system. To get traces of such a system we must look to peoples more civilized, and we soon find not only a considerable advance in the knowledge of the sounds used, but, what is of more importance, amore accurate definition of them. This definition is aided when, as often happens, they have introduced musical instruments with fixed tones.
There has been much speculation among philosophers and scientists as to the origin of music. Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, Letourneau, De Mortillet, and others agree that music originated with the ery of the human voice, and that it developed from vocal noises. Letourneau continues the simile by suggesting that the noises of nature were the originators of musical instruments. The others treat of vocal music, and their investigations and theories are devoted almost exclusively to an explanation of its origin. Darwin and Spencer differed as to the particular class of vocal noises which served as the origin of music. Darwin attributed it to the amatory class, that is, those sounds which the male makes during the excitements of courtship and in order to charm the female, and he thought that not only love music, but music in general was the resulting combination of these sounds. Spencer disagreed with the latter reason and was of the opinion that music had its germs in the sound which the voice emits under excitement, and that it eventually obtained its particular character according to the kind of excitement. Darwin, true to his development theory, believed that ‘the vocal organs were primarily used and perfected in relation to the propagation of the species.” Spencer, agreeing to the excitement

of love as a partial cause, extends it to include all other excitements to which animal feelings are susceptible.
The infantile cry, which it is said was the origin of music, has been reduced to writing and placed in the form of notes on the staff.

Rossini, in his opera of ‘Semiramide,” introduced into one of the choruses with great effect the cries and squeals of a party of children.
As the human cry grew it changed to represent passion, and possi-— bly by onomatopes it became articulate and so grew into language. With this came modulations of the voice, and Didero, with the others, says the cry of an animal in passion was the fundamental principle of music. Some animals, especially birds, have the power of music without language, but it is claimed that they can express by their music the same sentiments of passion as does man. It has, therefore, been declared that music does not belong exclusively to man, and it is certain that if exists among animals independent of articulate language. An observing student of nature, Mr. A. T. Camden Pratt,! has reduced some of the cries of our domestic animals to form, and has written them out in music.

Modern musical works not infrequently reproduce the songs of birds. * Listen to the nightingale” is an illustration which, however, only serves to show the superiority of the bird over his brother animal, man. The lark, the blackbird, the thrush, all have their songs, which, repeated again and again, are recognizable and known of all men, while the canary, the mocking bird, and the catbird sing not only their natural songs, but can be taught to sing many variations, if not to execute entirely new melodies. The author has seen a piece of music set to imitate a cackling hen and crowing cock, and all the world remembers Ole Bull’s “ Barnyard orchestra,” as played on his violin. Darwin reports to have heard a gibbon which modulated his voice to the extent of an octave, and, according to Savage, the black chimpanzee ( Troglodytes niger) gathers in troops at certain places and gives musical concerts by striking wood of various kinds—that is to say, trees standing, logs lying, or branches spreading—with a rod or pole, keeping time and forming a sort of melody or harmony of the different tones emitted from the object struck. If this be true these would seem to be musicians in the lowest scale and this to have been the most primitive musical instrument.
Musical instruments of percussion are the most simple, and the theory has been accordingly announced that they were the first to have been invented—that is, they were the earliest factors in human culture, and the first to be used among primitive peoples. The next in order of complexity, and accordingly in order of invention and evolution, were wind instruments. Rowbotham! divides them into types, of which his representatives are the drum, the pipe, and the lyre. Under

<<<Page: 693>>>

the first head fall rattles, gongs, triangles, tam-tams, castanets, tambourines, cymbals, all instruments of percussion; under the second head fall flageolets, flutes, hautboys, clarionets, bassoons, bugles, all wind instruments; under the third head fall all stringed instruments. He makes these types representatives of three distinct stages of development, through which, in the order named, he says, all prehistoric music has passed. ‘As in the geologic history of the globe the chalk is never found below the oolite, nor the oolite below the coal, so in the musical history of mankind is the lyre stage never found to precede the pipe stage, nor the pipe stage to precede the drum stage. In keeping with this is the fact that the savages sometimes have the drums alone, but never the pipe alone, or the lyre alone, for if they have the pipe they have the drum too, and if they have the lyre they always have both the pipe and drum.”
Pursuing this idea, Rowbotham! devotes many pages to descriptions of “savages,” who are in the respective stages of musical culture just described, and he gives the author or book from which he has obtaine | the information :

In continuation of his theory, Rowbotham adds instances of the dropping out of earlier forms of musical instruments, where the more primitive, instead of being used in conjunction with those of the higher order, were superseded by them.
Drums were in use in Lapland until 1600, yet in 1732 they are reported as having entirely died out.!

He says in his appendix (A), page 185:
I had prepared a catalogue of the African tribes with which we are acquainted, to discover whether the absence of stringed instruments prevailed in the center, the north, or in what direction it might be, of the continent. * * * But this tabulation I was obliged to discard, owing to the conflicting accounts of travelers; and, without endeavoring to trace the topography of the instruments, let us be content with the broad assertion that most of the tribes of Africa are in the lyre stage, and some are prematurely in it; that is to say, they are unacquainted with the use of pipes, which, in all strictness, should have preceded the knowledge of strings.
And he acknowledges his perplexity :
We have found that the lyre belongs to a very high stage of human development. We have found it in the hands of barbarians who were just emerging into civilization; yet in Africa we find it known to the most degraded savages.
This statement by Rowbotham throws doubt upon the correctness of his assumed order of development.
The collections of musical instruments in the United States National Museum and in the Royal Conservatory of Music in Brussels seem to verify his statement of the prevalence of the lyre among certain tribes of Africa where the pipe, or pipe and drum, are absent.
All this goes to show the difference between theory and fact, and is complimentary to Mr. Rowbotham in recognizing it.
Wallaschek wrote! after Rowbotham, and assailed strongly his theory of threefold development of aboriginal musical instruments. He denied the drum to have been the earliest or first invented, and asserted that which is demonstrated in this paper, that wind instruments (whistles, flageolets, and horns) were first invented and antedated drums. He reversed Rowbotham’s order of simplicity and argued that the lyre or harp of Africa, formed as it might have been from a bent twig or the two branches of a tree with a string stretched taut between the ends, was not only more primitive and easier and quicker made, but, as confessed by Rowbotham in his appendix, it was in fact invented and in use among the most degraded savages of the country; that it spread over a large portion of the continent of Africa before the pipe or drum, and that it was in use among many other tribes in connection with pipes, but without drums. He cites the fact that the shepherd boy can with ease and in a short time, while tending his flocks, make, with the aid only of his pocketknife, a willow whistle, which is not difficult to be transformed into a flageolet of considerable musical scale; while all drums, so far as known, among primitive peoples, whether prehistoric, as shown in this paper, or modern, as among primitive or savage peoples, are machines or instruments of considerable complexity, requiring labor and thought, with much preparation, in order to perfect them. The log must be hollowed and wrought out, and is usually decorated in a more or less elaborate manner (fig. 233). ‘The skin drum requires the preparation of the hoop and then of the skin, both of which require

<<<Page: 696>>>

considerable thought and time and can never be made impromptu or for an emergency.
Wallaschek declares that, both for simplicity and ease of manifacture, the pipe and lyre are in advance of the drum, and that the discoveries in antiquity and investigations in ethnography show them to have come earliest into use among both prehistoric and primitive peoples, and adds:
I can find nothing but speculative reasons and common consent for the drum being regarded as the most ancient instrument.
He continues (p. 87) his investigations among the various tribes and nations of primitive and savage peoples to demonstrate the error of
towbotham’s proposition and to show that the use of the pipe and lyre—that is to say, of wind and stringed instruments, without the drum—is quite as frequent and prevalent as is the contrary.
The authors are aware of the mass of literature on the science and practice of music, how historians and discoverers of primitive or savage peoples have reported, in many volumes, the music they have heard and the instruments with which it was made. These have not been followed nor any of their theories adopted. The sociologie or scientific sides of music among primitive or ancient peoples have been avoided. The authors have contented themselves with a description of prehistoric instruments and of such notes or tones as could be produced by their manipulation.
It was reserved for the white race to develop in times of antiquity the true art of musie as it is understood at the present time, but the different nations composing this race have varied much in their notions as to the solution of the problem.
The Egyptians made musie which, judging by the representations left of their musical performances and instruments, had considerable extent and variety. The exact nature of it can only be made out by ingenious inferences, and historians are at issue about their significance. It seems clear, however, that they acknowledged the octave, and that it was largely subdivided.
The music of the Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Phenicians may be assumed to have been of a similar character, the octave being also traced among them. Assyrian bas reliefs on monuments dating from 1000 B. C. represent musical instruments which must have been older, and possibly many centuries older, than the monuments on which they appear. Carl Engel' shows the intervals of the huayra-puhara? of the ancient Peruvians. Instruments of this kind, of reed or stone, have been found in ancient tombs. One in the British Museum has a double row of reed pipes, of which one is open below and the other closed.
The Hebrews attached great importance to their music, but there ebpbars no means of getting any definite information as to its cereals

The music of the Arabs seems to involve extraordinary complications, and has furnished endless occupation for musical historians and theorists. The most interesting fact in regard to it is that the principal intervals of our scale, namely, the octave and fifth, were also the most important intervals with them. But the resemblance ended here, for their octave was divided into sixteen, or, according to some authors, into seventeen parts, and these not always equal, so that their music must have been very different from anything we are accustomed to. Sanscrit literature contains traces of a musical system in India some three thousand years old, which is still cultivated there. They have also the octavo division, which is subdivided theoretically into twentytwo parts. Their practical scale consists of seven degrees, among which the twenty-two theoretical intervals are unequally divided. The notes in the usable scale admit of many changes, forming distinct modes, and the system generally has many analogies with that of the Greeks. It is worthy of remark, however, that, judging by the frets on their principal stringed instruments, the subdivision cf the octave by the fifth and fourth is acknowledged.
Another Aryan branch, the Persian, interests us because, so far as the early history of nations can be made out, their music seems to have been the remote ancestor of our own. The Aryans of Persia, like those of India, had originally a liking for minute intervals of sound, for they divided the octave into twenty-four parts.
It is through the known migrations of these races westward, and particularly into Greece, that their connection with our music is genealogically established. It is believed that, under the name Pelasgians, they settled in Asia Minor and in Greece some two thousand years before the Christian era, and their descendants or relatives, Lydians and Phrygians, afterwards mixed with other colonists, such as the Dorians, Aolians, Ionians, and Etruscans, who exercised considerable influence on their manners and customs.
The early history of Greek music is enveloped in obscurity. The Greeks had a most elaborate system of meter and rhythm, but it belonged chiefly to their poetry. The principal way in which they applied the idea of time to music was by making the duration of the sounds of unequal lengths correspond to the measures in their poetry, so that in singing, the long syllables should be sung to long notes and the short syllables to shorter notes. This was natural, but there is evidence that the idea was carried further, as signs for unequal length of notes existed in music unaccompanied by poetry, thus coming a little nearer to our modern notation. The earliest indications of a regular system of music are found in the little that is said of the poet musician Olympus, a Pelasgian by origin. He is believed to have lived during the twelfth century B. C., and is of some importance in history, as certain Greek authors and modern philologists ascribe to him the introduction into Grecian music of the so-called Enharmonic system. Others

<<<Page: 698>>>

ascribe it to the younger Olympus five hundred years later. A basrelief in the Albani Villa at Rome shows Pan teaching Olympus to play the syrinx. It is represented in Baumann’s History of Music.!
A great change is supposed to have been brought about among the Pelasgians by the entrance of the foreign colonists before mentioned. The influence of these people, more heroic and energetic, was to do away with the delicate estimation of sounds and to bring about arrangements in which the intervals were larger. Hence came into vogue certain musical forms which took the names of the people to whom they were due, and three of these, namely, the Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian, took at a later date a permanent place in the Greek system, and gave corresponding varieties of character to the music, the influence of which has been perpetuated to our own day.
About a century after Terpander came Pythagoras, whose genius as a philosopher enabled him not only to effect great improvements in the capabilities of music, but to establish for the art a definite and scientific basis intelligible for all time. He was, indeed, the founder of theoretical music, for it was he who first traced the laws which govern the relations of sounds to each other, and by this means brought music within the domain of natural philosophy. He established the principle that intervals could be appreciated intellectually by the aid of numbers instead of as formerly, by theear alone. ‘Sense,” he said, “is an uncertain guide; numbers can not fail.” Pythagoras effected this by means of the stretched strings used for the lyre. He had acuteness enough to perceive the fundamental fact that the length of the string might be made to supply an exact definition of the pitch of the note it sounded. Hence he was enabled to attach to each sound a certain numerical value, and thus to compare it with other sounds and to establish positive and definite relations between them. The instrument which Pythagoras used in these investigations was called a canon, and appears to have been similar to our monochord.
The importance of this step, connecting for the first time music and mathematics, can hardly be overrated, and as the method Pythagoras introduced has become verified and established in use by all subsequent experience and investigation, he is fairly entitled to be called the “father of musical science.” Out of his investigations the Diatonic scale grew into being. Euclid (B. C. 300), about two hundred and fifty years after Pythagoras, describes the formula and gives the proportionate length of string corresponding to the various notes of the scale, a mode of deterinination quite conclusive.
Other elements have been added, but the Diatonie scale has remained essentially unchanged. As the series of notes was when Euclid described it, so it is now, and as it formed the basis of Greek melodies two thousand years ago, so it forms the basis of the music of the present day.

Lartet and Christy found prehistoric whistles in the cavern of Laugerie Basse, in the Dordogne District, France. They also found whistles of the same kind in the cavern of Aurignae. It was supposed that both these caverns belonged to the Paleolithic period, and, therefore, they afforded corroborating evidence of the use of these instruments in that period. Later investigations rendered this certain with regard to Laugerie Basse, but made it uncertain with regard to Aurignac. When the first whistle was found, in 1860, in Aurignac it was reserved by these gentlemen for this confirmation, but afterwards, when, as they say, there had been many discoveries of this kind of instrument, notably those from the Laugerie Basse, so that specimens are not now rare in museums and collections, they felt themselves justified in assuming the existence and use of this instrument in Paleolithic times. Fig. 166 represents the whistle from Laugerie Basse, taken from Lartet and Christy’s ‘‘Reliquize Aquitanice,” and is plate V, fig. 21. It is described as the first digital phalange of the hind foot of a reindeer. A hole has been bored in its lower surface near the expanded upper articulation. On application of the lips ‘to the hollow of this articulation,

and states that others have been found in the caverns of Les Eyzies, Schussenried, and Chaffaud. He continues that they have been found in the Belgian caverns, in the peat beds of Scania, southern Sweden, in the island of Palmaria, and at other points. He says that there have been found, in the Grotto of Cottes, the radii (canon) of the reindeer and auroch treated in the same manner, and which might have been destined for the same purpose. He tells of Longperier’s mention of a human bone pierced with holes at regular intervals, serving, by a strange irony of death, as a flute with which to charm the living; also of Judge Piette, who, in one of his numerous excavations, discovered a flute made of two bird bones which, joined, would make modulated tones. Similar bones were found in the collection at Rochebertier. Beyond these he knows of none. The whistles, he thinks, may have been used in war or in the chase, but he expresses
‘Moeurs et Monuments des Peuples Prehistoriques, pp. 92, 93, No. 30.

<<<Page: 700>>>

no opinion as to the probable use of the flutes. The chief value of his report is in finding the instruments. This done, with their respective strata and associations, they speak for themselves, and the inspector or examiner is as well qualified to determine their function as is their finder. His qualification is to be determined by his experience with other or similar finds, and his ability to compare them with other instruments. It is to be remarked that, while the first series mentioned above by Marquis de Nadaillac are from caverns mostly or possibly Paleolithic, the remainder are probably Neolithic, though this would require closer examination and greater knowledge of the locality and strata of their origin than is now possessed by the author.
Furfooz is one of a number of prehistoric stations, many of which are Paleolithic, near Namur and Dinant, on the head waters of the River Meuse. They are justly celebrated by the excavations made therein by M. E. Dupont, the finds from which form a large proportion of the interesting display in the National Museum at Brussels. The greater number of these stations were caverns or shelters used by Paleolithic man. The superimposed strata in these caverns indicate with great certainty and satisfaction the chronological as well as the cultural sequence of their occupation by man. In one of these caverns, and in astratum believed to have been formed during the occupation by

enm, and which has figured so extensively in the determination by prehistoric anthropologists that, while man did not make or use pottery during the Paleolithic period in France, he did in Belgium. In this station at Furfooz has been found, in what stratum I am not able to say, nor even do I know positively in which cavern, but quoted from the Annals of the Société Archeologique of Namur! as having been found “dans les bains voisins de la forteresse,” a whistle of white clay, (en terre blanche) (fig. 167), in the form of a bird, the mouthpiece of which was in the tail and the venthole in the belly, as seen in the figure. Another whistle, said to have been found in the phosphate beds at Mesvin near Mons, Belgium, and claimed to have been paleolithic, is in the possession of M. Leon Somzée of Brussels. The question will immediately arise whether these were really musical instruments. It has been suggested that they were for calls or signals and may have been used, as the boatswain does his whistle, to direct the movements of men at a distance. This would not be music, and if they were always thus used they would not be musical instruments ; but if, on the other hand, they were used to give a rhythmical cadence
‘Volume XIX, 1892, p. 360.

<<<Page: 701>>>

to a dance or song, or for any similar purpose, they would be musical instruments. Any attempt to decide to which use these objects were put and so decide whether they were or were not musical instruments would be mere speculation. That they might have been used as such, and that hundreds of other similar instruments have been found which were used as musical instruments, justifies this classification and their insertion in this paper. nei
The Grotto or Cavern of Gourdan, in Haute Garonne, France, was explored by Judge E. Piette. The work of exploration lasted for three years (1871-1874), and was conducted by a Frenchman whom I met there who served as cook at Delmonico’s for four years (1861-1864), and who, having thus made his fortune, returned to Gourdan and established himself as innkeeper. He did the work of excavation under pay from Judge Piette, and it occupied him for three years. This was another of the caverns in which the superimposed strata evidenced the chronological and cultural sequence between the Paleolithic and Neolithic occupations. In a stratum of the later period, amid much charcoal and cinders, he found a bone flute or pipe pierced with holes and capable of producing three notes.
A memoir appeared in the report of the Socicté Académique des Sciences, etc., of St. Quentin, France, for the year 1873-74, XII, 3d ser., p. 039, written M. Textor de Ravisi, wherein he argued as to the existence of musical instruments in the age of stone, and, maintaining the affirmative, he cites the invention of M. Baudre, who had made what he called a ‘Clavier de silex,” that is to say, a sort of piano or xenophone, composed of twenty-eight stones, twenty-six of flint and two of schist. They were arranged according to note and sound, whether made so by size or shape is immaterial, and were struck with a pebble, producing the melody. The inventor chose natural pieces of flint, and did not chip them to size or form. He insisted that the natural pieces produced infinitely better tones than those which were chipped. While this instrument was entirely possible in Paleolithic times, yet there is nothing to show that it was ever invented or used. Indeed, there is nothing in all the discoveries that have ever been made to show that Paleolithic nan had any system of music applicable to this instrument, or that he would have recognized it or the music if either had been presented before him. There is an instrument similar to this in the Museum of Science and Art at Dublin, but the stones are all of schist and none of flint. These are no evidence of prehistoric musical instruments, and are only ingenious modern inventions by which our present scales of music are brought into use.

equidistant. SCANDINAVIA,
Luhrs.—The most elaborate, as well as the most beautiful instruments of music belonging to prehistoric times, were the bronze and gold trumpets or horns of Scan dinavia. They are not toys, but are of large size, quite as large as any horns of modern times, being sometimes 5 and even up to 8 feet in length, with bell mouths 6, 8, and 10 inches indiameter. No particular style was adopted, though all specimens agree in the requisites of the horn or trumpet. Some are Straight and some curved, after the fashion of the modern horn; others, again, are curved at one, and still others at both ends. The majority of these instruments are of bronze, cast in short seetions with joints or shoulders, which, being fitted, are riveted together. The straighter ones are in longer sections and, consequently, with fewer shoulders, while those more curved have proportionately shorter sections and
more shoulders. The vaFig. 168, riations of form and conseBRONZE HORN, MOLDED, quent changes in manufacLength, 8 feet.

inspection of the figures. These horns are called luhrs by the Danes. They are from southern Sweden and Denmark as far south as Sleswick, but not farther. They are found mostly in peat bogs. Whether this was an intentional deposit and for the purpose of their preservation has never been determined. Tig. 168 represents one of these large horns curved at both ends, in

the shape of the letter S, found at Maltbeck. It is nearly 8 feet in length, measuring the convex sides. It had been cast in sections, which have been fitted and riveted. It has a disk upon the larger end (similar to fig. 187 from Ireland), the decoration on which is a representation of the daisy flower. The small end was provided with its mouthpiece, which is rather uncommon, and, as will be seen shortly, it was capable of being played upon. The details of this instrument, mouthpiece, disk at bell mouth, chain, ring, and strap, are shown in accompanying figs. 169 a,b, c,d. This specimen is reported in the guidebooks of the Museum of Antiquities at Copenhagen as belonging to the fourth hall or room containing objects of the Bronze age, as No. 74, with the following label:
Twenty-three (23) trumpets of war (luhrs) composed of sundry pieces of bronze molded separately ; found in the peat bogs, ordinarily in pairs.
This instrument has attracted the attention, both of the archceological and musical world, and
‘sundry reproductions of it have been made—one is in the British museum, one in the Museum of Natural History, New York city, and one in the Musée Instrumental of the Royal Conservatory at Brussels (see No. 1156 of its catalogue), the latter giving the scale, from E-flat in the bass clef to E-flat on the upper space in the treble clef.

An enormous crowd fills the museum and neighboring square at Copenhagen every midsummer day to listen to a unique concert. A number of ancient Scandinavian horns more than three thousand years old, called “‘luren,” are kept in the museum. Of this collection fourteen are in good condition. They have an elegant shape, and the flat metal plates at the mouthpiece show good technical perfection and a developed taste for art. They are in different pieces fitted together. They are of very thin metal, and generally 7 feet long. A few years ago it was found out by Dr. Hammerich that they could still be blown or played upon. Their tones resemble those of the tenor horn, and they have a soft but powerful sound. Some are tuned in C and E sharp and others in D, E, or G, and these tones form an accord, but no

“scala.” On the balcony in the court of the palace in which is kept the Northern Museuin two members of the “capella” blow tunes on two of these primeval horns to the delight of the inhabitants.
Professor Starr says of one of these concerts:
We had the good fortune to be present. The court of the museum was filled with hearers. Wonderful, is it not, that horns two thousand years old, buried for long centuries in peat bogs, should, after this long silence, still be capable of giving out clear, ringing, even sweet, tones.!
The age of bronze is supposed to have begun in Scandinavia about 1500 B.C. It has been divided, for convenience of description, into the first and second periods, corresponding in some degree with the same ages in continental Europe, especially France, to which M. de Mortillet has given the names (1) Morgien and (2) Halstattien. These subdivisions have been made principally from the inspection of the objects themselves, their development, and their associations. It is believed by those who have studied the subject with the greatest attention and the most in detail that whencesoever the bronze may have come and howsoever the knowledge to work it came, that most ot the objects found in Scandinavia were made in the country; consequently, are of a culture and art indigenous thereto, and that this applies to both periods. Nearly all bronze objects were made by casting. It is not until near the close of the age of bronze that evidences of hammering as a method of manufacture have been found. Hammering and drilling were employed after the object had been cast, and for the purpose of putting it together. Many molds in which objects were cast have been found throughout the country, but, so far as known to the author, none which were used for casting these trumpets or horns. A moment’s consideration will make apparent the difficulty in casting. Their length, the size of the piece, the thinness of wall, the extent of core, together with the exactness required to make the sonorous quality, not only so that they shall sound, but that they shall make a note within a given scale—a consideration of these difficulties, and the ability displayed by their makers in overcoming them, should increase largely our appreciation of the capacity of the workmen. One of the most beautiful specimens of bronze vases of elegant form and choice decoration was found in the Island of Funen with the core of clay still in it, thus enabling its discoverers to determine with certainty the method of its manufacture. The casting had failed in part and was never completed. The many other similar vases which were snecesstully made is proof of the capability of the workman. No evidences of the art of soldering during the bronze age have been found in Seandinavia. Not only have no soldered specimens been found, but many objects were repaired without solder. Two methods were employed, riveting, or by the apparently more difficult process, described elsewhere, of pouring molten metal on the junction of the broken pieces

until they themselves have become melted and the new and old were fused and formed a solid mass.
Thus much for the Bronze age; but this does not account for all the prehistoric objects in bronze belonging to that country. The prehistoric ages of iron have been divided into three epochs, covering a period from some time anterior to the Christian era until about 1000 A. D., when the historic period as represented in the known languages of Europe began. The languages used in Scandinavia prior to this time were Runic. They were protohistoric but afterwards passed out of use. The term “iron age,” while it denotes the use of iron, was principally applied to its use for cutting implements. Bronze did not cease to be used for many purposes, and among the rest, for the luhrs or trumpets or horns. Therefore many of these instruments of bronze have been found which belonged to the prehistoric ages of iron. The question of chronology can only be determined by critical examinations of almost infinitesimal details in the manufacture, form, kind, and use of implements, and of the objects associated with them, and even then errors are not infrequent. This should be borne in mind in criticising the assignment of any given instrument to a certain age or period.
In the last age of iron, when the runes had passed their final stage of improvement and are capable of being read, we gain much information therefrom concerning the life history of the people, and find they made war, indulged in the chase, and played games, as other people did then and have ever done. A social custom which prevailed among the Scandinavians, peculiar to them and to the Celts, and possibly other peoples, was that of minstrelsy, whereby the instruments of music were brought into use. Mr. Montelius! says:
Of musical instruments, we read of the lyre, the horn, the pipe, the fiddle, and above all the harp, one of the oldest and most prized. Snorri relates of Olaf Sk6tkonung, that when the meats were set upon the king’s table, the players stepped forth with ‘‘harps, fiddles, and other instruments.” To the tones of the harp the skalds generally sang their songs. Skalds often visited at the court of the Swedish kings; sometimes they came from Iceland.
Of these, the horn only seems to have been prehistoric, and it alone has received attention in this paper.
In 1801 eight of these large curved bronze horns were found in a peat bog or turf bed, Brudevzelte, in a field near Liunge in the neighborhood of Fredericksborg. These were intact and complete, mouthpiece and all, are in the museum at Copenhagen, and have lately been played upon, as previously related. The longest was 6 feet and some inches, while the largest disk on the bell mouth was 11 inches in diameter.
Fragments of bronze horns had before been found throughout that

country and gave rise to much speculation as to their possible origin and use. The discovery of these complete horns identified the objects and solved the doubts.
Another bronze horn in the museum of Copenhagen, 5 feet in length, was discovered in a peat bog at Wedellsborg, Island of Funen, in the year 1809. It had a chain attached.

The mountings are elaborate and are attached at either end in such way as to lengthen the horn and increase its power as a musical instrument. The two mountings are attached by a bronze chain with long links, which has served for suspension or carrying. It is taken from Montelius.2 The small ends of many of these horns were destroyed when found, and so it is undeterminable whether they were used for music or for drinking. Horns similar in all appearance to these were in that country and in that epoch used for both purposes.

Gallehuus, on the western coast and in the Duchy of Sleswick, near the boundary between Denmark and Germany. These instruments
are, or were, so beautiful and valuable, and their history so well authenticated, as to jus-
tify their description. On July 20, 1639, a young girl of poor family named Kristine Svendatter (daughter of Svenon) left her house to go to the little village of Tonder. Walking in her bare feet, she stubbed her toe against what she BRONZE HORN FROM SCANDINAVIA. thought to be a root. Worsaie. She struck it a blow with her staff, gave an imprecation upon it, and passed on. Some days afterwards fate or luck caused her to pass the same way, and she struck her toe against the same object, which excited her indignation if not her wrath, and she determined to cut down or dig up the root which lay in the path of travelers and which on these two occasions had served her sucha trick. She dug it out and found it to be this horn (fig.174). Certain neighbors gave her their opinion that it was a huntsman’s old tin

horn and not worth carrying home; but she decided to the contrary and carried it with her, with no idea of what it really was. Arrived at home, she washed it and concluded it to be of tin or copper, still of no value. There were certain rings upon it which she gave the children to play with. After some days she went to the market town and took with her one of these rings to be examined, when it was discovered that the ring was not only gold, but unusually fine gold. The King of Denmark, Christian IV, was then at Gluckstadt with his son, Prince Christian. The’ golden horn was brought to him, he made recompense to the girl, and presented the horn to his son, the prince. He had at first the idea to have the piece melted and made into a newfashioned cup, but better counsels prevailed, and a goldsmith was employed to clean and put it in good shape, which he did. It had neither cork nor mouthpiece, so no one was able to say whether it had been used as a music or a drinking horn. The gold worker settled the question for the moment by preparing a cork with gold trimmings, and the horn was ever afterwards used as a drinking cup on state occasions. Its capacity was 5 pints.
About one hundred years thereafter, April 21, 1734, a poor peasant named Lassen, or Laritzen, of the same village of Gallehuus, was digging for clay in the field about 25 paces from his cabin, when his pick struck an object which shone with great splendor. On digging it out it was found to be the gold horn indicated (fig. 175). Almost a hundred years had passed since Kristine Svensdatter had stubbed her toe against the first one and, naturally, there was difficulty in identifying the exact spot, but according to tradition, the second was found 33 paces to the southwest of the first. The horn was cared for by a goldsmith in Tonder, determined to be fine gold, and then placed in the possession of Count Otto Diderick Schack, proprietor of the domain. It

was transmitted to King Christian VI, who gave to the peasant 200 rigsdalers.
Description of the horn found in 1639 (fig. 174): Its length was 34 inches; at the bell mouth its circumference was 124 inches, and the diameter 44 inches; at the small end, which, however, had no mouthpiece, its circumference was 4¢ inches, and its diameter 14 inches. Its weight was 6 pounds 64 ounces. Its manufacture was complicated, somewhat difficult to describe in detail, and, perhaps, unimportant from the view point of a musical instrument. It was made of thick sheet gold; whether hammered or cast does not appear. It was double throughout, one sheet forming the interior, which was solid, smooth, and polished; whether made in a single sheet or by a succession of sheets soldered together is not now known. The interior sheet of gold was less pure than the exterior. The exterior plate was made in bands or sections, as shown by fig. 176, thirteen regular ones and a small one at the bell mouth. These bands graduated in size and length from the large to the small end of the horn. The six smallest bands were

soldered to the interior sheet so as to form a solid piece. The other seven bands were different. While the bands at the smaller end may have been made separate and afterwards soldered togetier, the junction being covered by the solid ring, as shown in the figure, it is certain that the seven larger bands were made separate, for they were not soldered together, but inserted one into the other continuously after the fashion of a stovepipe, the junction being crimped so as to prevent their separation, yet permitting them to be rotated one upon the other. These junctions were then covered by separate gold rings, as shown in the figure, each ring fitting to its particular place. These seven larger bands were covered with figures, some of which were cast and soldered on, while others were made by punch marks (pointillé). The character and different kinds of these designs are not to be described, yet will be apparent on inspection of fig. 176, showing details.

the same general method with a smooth interior surface and exterior bands, all of which were soldered together. There were only five exterior bands in the fragment. The weight was, nevertheless, 7 pounds 54 ounces—15 ounces more than the first one, although that was com-

The designs upon the two horns, respectively, are from their form, manner of making, and mechanical work generally, evidence that they both belonged practically to the same epoch. The ornaments (fig. 177) upon the horn (fig. 175) (1734) were artistically inferior to theother. There have been, of course, many attempts on the part of antiquarians to decipher or translate these figures and discover the date of the making of the horns. These efforts have resulted in many theories, with none of which we are particularly interested. They were supposed to be calendars of antiquity, to

and had probably served as ornaments in the temple of Jomale in Burmah, a suggestion derived from certain Sagas of Herraud and de Bose. He interprets the Runic inscription as Celt-[berian, and perhaps Druidie.
The second gentleman attributes these golden horns to a different origin. He thinks he recognizes the gold of which they are made as from Hungary, Transylvania, or perhaps the Crimea. The figures upon them suggest to him the usage of the Vandals who combined the worship of Odin, Thor, and Friga, with that of their national gods, It is agreed by both these gentlemen that the figures denote a barbarous epoch so far in the past that, if they have any meaning at all, it is now inexplicable beyond theory or suggestion.
The last found horn (that of 1754), fig. 175, had a Runic inscription in the narrow band at its bell mouth. This inscription has been read, reread, and guessed at, until it has received every kind of rendition. The results of the prineipal attempts in this direction have been given in extenso by Mr. C. C. Rafn.'
W. F. Kopf, 1821, writes: “Iam (both) a horn of the chase (htuntsman’s horn) and a drinking cup (dedicated) to the orgie (ceremony) of Holte.”
According to Gisle Brynjulfsson, 1823: “I, Hlevus, have made these two horns,” or “ Thorfin and Leif have made both these horns.”
Fin Magnusen, 1834, says: ‘‘I bring to the sacrifice the envelope of the horn of Tovid.”
N. M. Petersen, 1837, gives: ‘‘ I, Hlevo, have made the envelope of this horn.”
According to Jacob H. Bredsdorff, 1838: “I, Hleva, have made these horns for my guests, the inhabitants of the forest (the Holsteinois).”
Jacob Grimm, 1848, writes: ‘ Holsatis, intimis hospitibus pocula dedi.”
K. Mullenhoff, 1852, says: “‘I have made these horns for the Holzingen, or guardians of the forest.”
©. C. Rafn himself makes the following literal rendition:
ECHLEV 0G OSTIR HULTINGOR HURNO TVO VIgI U which he translates into Danish as follows:
Kehlev ak Astir (Eyleife ok Astyr) Hyltingar tva (tvo) vigpu, which in English is ‘The Holsteinois, Echlev and Astyr, have initiated (or consecrated) these two horns.” According to his examination of history as set forth in certain of the Sagas, Mr. Rafn concludes that Eglaf or Kyleif was a chief of the southern Danes in Holstein about the fifth century. :
Both golden horns were deposited in the Royal Cabinet of Curious Objects. A thief, by the aid of false keys, broke into the cabinet May

4, 1802, and stole both horns. To avoid detection, he melted them into bars, and, being a goldsmith, he fabricated therewith chains, collars, buckles, and other jewelry. This further excited his avarice, and he began the falsification or adulteration of the gold in his manufactured objects, which led to his detection and final conviction.
The foregoing descriptions were from measurements, drawings, and casts made while the horns were in existence.
Bronze horns.—The ancient musical instruments of Ireland, so far brought to the notice of archieologists, are the horn or trumpet, the harp, and the bagpipe. The two latter are more modern and are probably not prehistoric. The Museum of Science and Art at Dublin possesses several ancient harps, attractive on account of their historic and national interest, but they are not for us. The only prehistoric objects found suspected of belonging to this class are the bone hairpins (7) from the Strokestown Crannoge.

lines. It is otherwise decorated with dots and lines. Sir Wilham Rk. Wilde! was doubtful about this being a musical instrument. He says:
If it was the top member of a lute or a small rude harp, the holes might have been used for holding the pins to which the strings were fastened.
It is here figured as possibly a musical instrument.
M. Paul du Chaiilu wrote his interesting work, ‘* The Viking Age,”” to demonstrate the proposition that the early settlers of Britain and the British Isles were Vikings rather than Anglo-Saxons. He based his theory upon the similarity of the many objects found, respectively, in Britain and Denmark. While his theory has not been accepted generally, yet it must be confessed that the similarity he points out was remarkable. Not the least is it so with regard to the trumpets or horns (luhrs). A fact in this similarity opposed to Du Chaillu’s theory is that the greater, almost the entire, number of these trumpets are found in Ireland, while they are extremely rarein England. Sir John Evans’ records that as early as 1715 Mr. F. Nevill described‘ eight bronze trumpets found at Dunganon, County Tyrone, Ireland.

Sir W. R. Wilde! reports that the earliest historic notice of the discovery of these instruments was by Sir Thomas Molyneaux in his ‘Discourse Concerning the Danish Mounds, Forts, and Towers of Ireland,” 1725. This author bases his opinion upon the work of Olaus Wormius’s treatise of the antiquities of Denmark (1655), in which everything of high antiquity found in Ireland was accredited to the Danes. This was carried to such excess as to include many things exclusively Irish, and of which nothing like them were ever found in Denmark. These authors were followed in some degree by Du Chaillu.
In 1750 thirteen or fourteen of these curved bronze horns were discovered near Cork. Three of them were figured by Charles Smith in his “History of the County of Cork,” and are believed to be the same sold to Bishop Pocock and figured by the Society of Antiquaries in “ Vestuta Monumenta,” and afterwards copied in the ‘Historical Memoirs of the Trish Bards,” 1786.
Three trumpets and a fragment of straight tube were discovered in the County of Limerick in 1787, and figured in Volume II of its Transactions. In 1794 four bronze trumpets were found in a bog on the borders of Loch Nashade, near Armagh. In 1809 two joints of a large and perfect curved bronze trumpet were found in a peat bog at Ardbrin, County Down. In 1833 Dr. Petrie’ described and figured a cast bronze horn, one of several found at Dowris and then in possession of the Dean of St. Patrick, one of which is here represented as fig.181. In 1835 several trumpets were discovered in a bog near Killarney. The largest measured 15 inches and the smallest 104 inches from point to point. They were distributed among various antiquarians in Cork. In 1847 three trumpets were discovered near Cloghoughter Castle, County Cavan. In 1840 four trumpets were discovered in the bog of Drumbest, County Antrim.
The Royal Irish Academy, recently consolidated with the Kensington Museum under the denomination of the Museum of Science and Art, Dublin, possesses sixteen specimens of these bronze trumpets. Sir W. R. Wilde* divides them into two classes—(1) those of which the small end is stopped and the mouth hole is in the side, flute fashion, and (2) those with the small end open and the mouthpiece inserted trumpet or horn fashion. On none of the specimens was any mouthpiece found, but the appearance when found and subsequent examination satisfies the student of its existence and use. Of those blown from the ends, some were cast and some hammered and riveted. Those closed at the end and with mouth hole on the side were all cast. From these differences he makes five varieties of prehistoric bronze trumpets in Ireland.
The cast specimens were in one piece, having been molded com-

plete in a single operation, the work of cleaning, drilling, and decorating having, as in modern times, been done subsequently.
The other specimens were of thin sheet bronze, originally cast, for bronze can be made only by casting. How thin the bronze originally was when cast we have no knowledge, but whatever its thickness it must have been hammered, probably many times, being annealed each time to prepare it. Reduced to the proper thickness by whatever process, it was bent by hammering, probably repoussé, into the proper form, usually, if not always, in two pieces. The edges, being brought together, are fastened by any of the various methods of riveting. Fig. 190 is a representation of the details of the operation of riveting as employed in fig. 189. Sometimes the strips of thin bronze were laid on the outside as well as inside and the rivets put through three instead of two thicknesses. This was the case with fig. 187. While these workmen must have had knowledge of the art of soldering (shown in their gold work by the attachment of collars, rings, etc.), yet none of these instruments are reported as having been thus made.
Several of these instruments had been broken in ancient times and mended by the prehistoric workman. The methods of doing this show that in prehistoric times, as well as early Christian times, the metal workers of Ireland were of a high order and possessed of a degree of skill greater, probably, than any in Europe at the same period. Thedisplayin the Museum of Scienceand Artin Dublin of gold, silver, and bronze work, dating earlier than the eleventh century, will demonstrate the truth of this proposition. Reproductions in baser metal made by Mr. Edward Johnson, an antiquarian jeweler of Dublin, were displayed in the British section at the Chicago Exposition and were admired by all who had the good fortune to see them.
The instruments cast in molds were mended by a process called “burning,” i. e., pouring molten metal on the junction of the broken | pieces until they were themselves melted, when the old and the new metal would be fused into a solid mass and the break repaired. Occasionally this produced an enlargement, as in the case of fig. 183. In other specimens the ends or edges of the broken pieces were brought together and brazed. This was the usual course when mending broken bronze swords or daggers. Yet many times these swords, with other broken objects, were sent to the foundry for recasting. Fourteen thousand broken pieces of this or similar kinds were found together, forming part of the great prehistoric bronze foundry in Bologna, Italy. Where the bronze had been hammered, the process of reparation was by dove. tailing or by riveting, and sometimes both. Fig. 190 represents the details of one of these processes.

Other pieces of wooden horns were found in 1837 in a bog at Killyfaddy, near Clogher, County Tyrone. These were made in the same manner as the foregoing, about 28 inches long, 2 inches in diameter, and with dowel tubes which fit together as a flute. (See figs. 186-191.)

Bronze horns.—According to Sir John Evans—?*
English trumpets of bronze belonging to prehistoric times are of rare occurrence.
One found in the River Witham, Lincolnshire, has been figured in the Philosophical
Transactions,! and is nearly straight for the greater part of its length (about 28
inches), curving upward near the end into an irregularly-shaped expanding mouth. It has an ornament or crest like a mane along the exterior curve. In form it is not unlike the carnyx, which is brandished by the horseman on the coins of the British princes Eppillus and Tasciovanus,? and which also appears on some Roman coins and monuments commemorative of Gallic and British victories. The metal on analysis gave copper 88, tin 12, and the tube was formed from a hammered sheet and soldered with tin. It not improb-
‘ably belongs to a period not far removed from that of the Roman invasion of this country.
Another, with two joints and a perfect mouthpiece, is said to have been found at Battle, Sussex, and has been engraved by Grose.°

ancient explorers, especially those from Spain, mention hawks’ bells as objects of trade with the aborigines:
The only (similar) examples which Iam able to adduce are those which formed part of the Dowris hoard (Ireland), one of which is represented in fig. 446. There are three such in the Royal Irish Academy and four in the British Musenm. With the latter is a smaller plain bell of the same character and two unfinished castings. Sir W. R. Wilde observes that in casting, the metal appears to have been poured into the mold by an aperture at the side, through which the core of clay that contained the metal clapper was broken up. The mold was in two halves and the rings and staples at the ends were cast together. In the perfect examples at the British Museum the sides of the holes by which the core was extracted have been hammered together, so as in some cases to be almost closed. In one instance there is some appearance of the sides having been brazed together.
The sound emitted by these bells is dull and feeble. Like the modern horse bells, a number of them may have been hung together, and not improbably employed in a similar manner to attract the attention both of the eye and the ear.
This bell was part of the “ Dowris find,” Kings County, Ireland (as was the trumpet, fig. 181), described in Sir W. R. Wilde’s catalogue,’ who says that they were of great antiquity may be inferred from the character of the metal of which they are composed, as well as the cireumstances under which they were found. They were believed to have been the ecclesiastical bells used by the Druid priests, and as such have been called ‘“ crotals,” but there is not sufficient authority to state this confidently. A number of these, and others more spherical, have been found in Ireland. The globular ones are 14 to 23 inches in diameter, while the specimen represented in fig. 193 is 64 inches long, including the ring, and 2,7, inches in diameter. We shall later refer to specimens of great similarity found in Mexico and Central and South America regarding which a priori theorists have jumped at the conclusion that because of this similarity with modern and Old World forms they were imported, or at least were white man’s work. We shall also see how Prof. W. H. Holmes, in his paper on ‘“ Ancient art of the Province of Chiriqui,”’ denounces and upsets this theory.
Trumpets, or war horns.—Fig. 194 represents one of the prehistoric Gaulish trumpets, or war horns. It belongs to France. No complete original of this has ever been found, but from fragments and from a representation upon the Roman triumphal arch at Orange, archzeologists have been able to reconstruct and reproduce it. On that arch a Gaulish soldier is represented as sounding his trumpet, from which it is Supposed to have been a war trumpet. The other objects of bronze and of gold found and identified as belonging to Gaul at and prior to
the Roman conquest demonstrate the entire capability of these people to make such instruments, while the discovery of the fragmeuts and partially destroyed pieces establishes affirmatively the fact of their

existence. Roman historians of the time of Cresar have reported and
described these instruments from Gaul, and Polybius! says that

Gresset,
The parade and tumult of the army of the Celts terrified the Romans, for there was amongst them an infinite number of horns and trumpets which, with the shouts of the whole army in concert, made a clamor so terrible and loud that every surrounding echo was awakened, and all the adjacent country seemed to join in the horrible din.
Diodorus” says of: the Gauls that they had barbaric trumpets of a special nature which gave a hoarse sound well suited to the din of battle. The use of war trumpets among the Celtic population of western Europe has been more than once mentioned by classic writers, and passages {rom them have been cited by Sir John Evans, Sir Augustus W. Franks, and others.’ Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities describes the lituus as a sort of trumpet slightly curved at the extremities, differing both from the tuba and cornu, the former being straight and the latter bent into a spiral. Lydus calls the lituus the sacerdotal trumpet, and says it was em. ployed by Romulus when he proclaimed the title of his city. Acro asserts that it was peculiar to cavalry, while the tuba belonged to infantry. Its tones are characterized as harsh and shrill. The Roman lituus seems to have been much the same shape as the figure here given (fig. 194), which was called the carnyx, the end of which was sometimes made to represent the fanciful head of an animal.
A horn, not prehistoric, but of high antiquity and well known in ancient history, is that of Charlemagne, preserved in the treasury of the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle. It is ivory, and was made from a veritable elephant tusk. A cast of it is in the museum of the Conservatory of Music in Brussels (No. 1158), and its scale (obtained from this copy) is from C flat below, to F within, the staff.

The only mention by Dennis of music or musical instruments as having been found in Etruria is that of—
A singular spear or rod with a number of movable disks which might have been rattled together so as to keep time, and which, as it was found in connection with armor and weapons, seems to mark it for military use and may have served as an accompaniment to a band. A similar instrument was found in the neighborhood which had on its top the figure of a naked man dancing. !
This describes the tintinnabulum which was in use in different parts of the eastern hemisphere in prehistoric times. This instrument is figured and described in De Mortillet’s ‘“‘ Musée Préhistorique”? and in Wilson’s “Swastika”? as found from India to the Swiss Lake dwellings.
There have been several specimens, the handiwork of prehistoric man, found in his graves or stations, cited by authors on music, not themselves archeologists, under the supposition that these were musical instruments; but this is only a hypothesis and subject to confirmation by future discovery. The Archeological Journal, 1864, reports the discovery of a bone which Professor Owen pronounced to be that of the Irish elk. It was found in a moat at Desmond Castle, Ireland, and was thought to have formed part of a musical instrument, notably the Irish lyra. The uncertainty of this contention is apparent when it is noted that other persons equally, and perhaps better, qualified to judge, gave it as their opinion that it formed part of a crossbow. Others have reported the tusks or teeth of cave bear, dog, and other animals, found with holes drilled, one can now almost say with certainty. for suspension, but the musicians have tried to convert them into whistles. This they do by saying that to stop the hole on the opposite side and blow as in the cylinder of a key it will make a whistling sound.
Other individuals have supposed that pieces of hard stone, notably jade, with one or more holes drilled therein, were used as musical instruments, because when suspended and struck, they gave forth a sonorous sound. This is not impossible, but it is improbable.
There are in the United States National Museum scores of objects of jade which have been sawed and otherwise elaborately carved and worked, and which have been drilled with one or two hoies. (Plates 39, 40.) It also has, as does every other collection, gorgets and so-called ceremonial objects, drilled as for suspension, all of which are, to a certain extent, sonorous and will emit a musical tone when struck; but the same thing is equally true of any reasonably large flake or blade of flint or obsidian. The large chalcedonic spearheads from Arkansas, the flint, rhyolite, and chalcedonic leaf-shaped implements will likewise emit a sonorous sound when suspended and struck. It is evident
'Dennis, Etruria, II, p. 444. 2? Fig. 1230. 3 Page 799, fig. 29.

<<<Page: 727>>>

that none of these were ever intended for musical instruments, and this effectually disposes of the claim that the former objects were so used. Almost any piece of steel, or even iron, certainly glass, made in modern times, will emit a sonorous sound; but when these materials are utilized in the construction of musical instruments, that intention is always apparent. (See p. 526.)
The United States National Museum possesses a large, interesting, and valuable collection of musical instruments, which have been obtained primarily through the interest of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the National Museum. Very many of these are extremely primitive and might well have served in prehistoric times. Their use by savages and primitive peoples in the earliest stages of their history shows an almost certain connection with prehistoric times. It has, therefore, been considered proper that they should be noticed among prehistoric instruments.
The Museum has also published various memoirs and ethnological papers, reports of travels, descriptions and catalogues of collections, wherein savage and primitive musical instruments have been figured. It is deemed wise to employ this material so far as it relates to or will elucidate the subject in hand so that it may be brought together, and, so far as possible, a view of prehistoric musical instruments, especially those in the United States National Museum, presented.
The principal among these publications are: ‘“‘The Shofar, Its Use and Origin,”! by Dr. Cyrus Adler, curator of oriental antiquities; “‘ Notes on the Ethnology of Tibet,”? by William Woodville Rockhill; “The Indians of the Northwest Coast,”* by Lieut. Albert P. Niblack, United States Navy; ‘‘ Ethnology of Ungava District, Hudson Bay Territory,”* by Lucien M. Turner; “A Study of Siouan Cults,”* by J. Owen Dorsey; “The Point Barrow Esquimo,”® by John Murdoch. These will be employed in connection with unpublished Museum material, and the whole arranged geographically.
Dr. Cyrus Adler, speaking of the shofar,’ says:
It is not only the solitary musical instrument actually preserved in the Mosaic ritual, but is the oldest form of wind instrument known to be retained in use in the world.

that this was an instrument no doubt used in prehistoric times. ~ * * (p. 448). Wetzstein is of the opinion that the use of the ram’s horn may have been borrowed by the Israelites, and goes back to a people who were engaged solely in the care of sheep. By these it was used as a signal of alarm. * * * (p. 438). There seems to be little doubt that it has been continuously used in the Mosaic service from the time it was established until now. * * * The shofar was not the only natural horn used by the Israelites as a musical instrument, but 10 copies or representations of the other instruments have come down to us.
The shofar is described at length by Dr. Adler, together with the regulations as to its use and the reference made to it in the Bible. He says (p. 446):
From the Talmud we learn that the use of the shofar as a note of alarm of war was transferred to other seasons of danger and distress. Famine, plague of locusts, and drought (Mishna Taanith, I, 6) occasioned the blowing of the shofar.
The shofar was employed at the public ceremony of excommunication. (Wetzstein, p. 67.)

uses, possibly according to the note that was blown. It was the signal for going out to battle, for the announcement of a victory, and for a recall of the troops.
He figures many shofars on plates XCVII-O, which are fully described, and to which reference is made for further information. Butin the plate first mentioned he shows many aboriginal horns similar to the shofar, principally from Africa.
Figs. 1 and 2, plate 68, are shofars (his plate XCVII) assigned to Palestine and Syria. They are described as made of a ram’s horn straightened and flattened by heat. The bore of the instrument is a cylindrical tube of very small caliber, which opens into a kind of bell of parabolic form.
Fig. 195 is labeled as a Naigha, David’s pipe, from Palestine, a double pipe of two parallel tubes of cane attached by cords. Each tube has four finger holes. The mouthpieces are

made separate and inserted in the smaller ends. They are close together and are intended to be blown both at the same time. The instrument is of the clarionet type. Vibrating reeds are attached to these small mouthpieces by cords wound about them at the outer end, leaving the inner end free for vibration. The free ends of the cords by which the parallel tubes are bound are attached to the mouthpieces to preventloss. The length of this instrument is 94 inches, the diameter of the tube is 4 inch, of the mouthpiece 4+ inch. (Gift of A. B. Karny.)
Tig. 196represents a pottery drum from Syria. (Collected by Erhard Bissinger, United States consul.) The shell is of red earthenware in the shape of a longitudinal seetion of a bottle. It has a parchment head _ stretched, stitched, and glued in place. The pottery is decorated with incised zigzag lines nearly equidistant throughout the length of the instrument. It is 165 inches in height, and its respective diameters are 33 and 102 inches.

the horn or to form a cup-shaped mouthpiece, as has been done so frequently with similar instruments, both ancient and modern, Of this instrument Dr. Adler says (p. 449):
In form it differs in nowise from the shofar. It is an ancient outdoor wind instrument commonly known as the Indian horn, and was the favorite instrument of the Hindu god Siva. *~ * * ‘The metallic descendant from the Indian buffalo horn, the shringa, is the rana-shringa, an outdoor instrument made of copper, formerly used in military, and now universally in religious processions throughout India, both by Hindus and Mohammedans, the performers usually being Hindus of the lower caste. In the villages of southern and central India the watchmen blow it at sunset and at certain hours of the night, like the German nachtwachter. In large cities a hornblower is always attached to the police. There is seldom a guard or detachment of native irregular troops without one. It is employed in all processions, temple services, marriages, and other festive occasions, and at funerals. Another trumpet of the same class is the kurna, used chiefly in religious processions, or in festivals in honor of local divinities. Only Brahmins and persons of a certain rank are permitted to use the kurna. It is esteemed by all Brahmins to be the most ancient instrument of music in existence, and the sound of it to be especially pleasing to the gods in various particular ceremonies and at solemn parts of the sacrifice.
This particular specimen is black in color, 124 inches in length, and 25 inches in its greatest diameter.
The conch shelis of India, like those of some other countries, have the apex ground or cut off until a hole is opened, sometimes directly, sometimes laterally, which forms a mouthpiece. The natural cavity of the shell forms the bore. Specimen, Cat. No. 92711 (U.S.N.M.) is a horn called Shanka, made from a shell of the Turbenella pyrum which has been treated in the same manner. Its length is 6 inches, diameter 3? inches. Specimen, Cat. No. 92712 (U.S.N.M.) is a horn named Gomukha, and made from a cassis or helmet shell. Its length is 10 inches, diameter 8} inches. Specimen, Cat. No. 92713 (U.S.N.M.), a Shell (Pterocera), has been treated in the same manner and made into a horn called Barataka. Length 114 inches, width 44 inches.
The musical instruments of the Tibetans, while not prehistoric, are quite primitive. They are described by Mr. Rockhill, in his “ Journey through Mongolia and Tibet,!” published by the Smithsonian Institution, as drums (yang ko ku), gongs, cymbals, and tambourines (t’ai-p’ing ku), and figured in his ‘‘ Notes on the Ethnology of Tibet,?” wherein he describes them more at length. Those employed in religious obseryances or in church ceremonies are the small hand drum (damaru), frequently made of children’s skulls and covered with snake skin, and the bell (drilbu). On his plate 40, figs. 1 and 2 are damarus, of which fig. 2 is made of two skulls attached by a wooden disk. Heads of devils and skulls are painted on them in red and blue colors. A small cotten

band covers the disk between the two heads and projects a few inches, so as to be held in the hand. Fig. 1is smaller and the skulls are not painted, but the band is of embroidered satin, decorated with elaborately knotted Chinese silk tassels. The bell (drilbu) is of bronze and usually about 22 inches in diameter. His figs. 4 and 5, plate 41, represent such bells. Fig. 4 is made in Derge, famous for its clear-toned bells. Fig. 5 comes from the famous Lamasery of Dolonnor, eastern Mongolia. Musical instruments belonging to Tibet, exclusive of those used in religious worship, plate 69 (his plate 24), are (1) the whistle (ling-bu, figs. 1-3) of bamboo or the bone of an eagle’s wing, with six or seven key holes; (2) the jew’s-harp (k’a-pi, figs. 4-6), and (3) the banjo or guitar (piwang, kopong, or dra-nyan), with three or more strings. The latter is not figured by Mr. Rockhill. The figures of the former sufficiently explain themselves, but the jew’s-harp is here described because of its occurrence among distant savage peoples.
Mr. Rockhill says:
The jew’s-harp is made not by the Tibetans, but by the Lissus and other non-Tibetan tribes inhabiting southeast Tibet, and is a favorite instrument in eastern Tibet, where nearly all the women carry one suspended from their girdles. Three harps are used simultaneously, each giving a different note; the deepest note is called p’o kii or ‘‘inale sound,” the intermediate one ding kii or ‘“‘middle sound,” the sharpest one mo kii or ‘female sound.” They are held the one below the other in the order above given between the thumb and the index finger of the left hand, and struck with all the fingers of the right hand, the one after the other. ‘These k’a-pi are carried in small bamboo cases ornamented with little rings of bamboo, often dyed, and also with geometric carvings, which are also colored. They are shown in the lower portion of this plate.
Jew’s-harps similar to those used in Tibet are found among the Ainu and in New Guinea, but in many other countries where a bamboo harp is used, the sound is produced by jerking the harp by a string. This is the case in Assam, in parts of Sumatra, among the Yakuts, the tribes of Torres Straits, etc. (p. 715.)

The instrument is of the reed type, as is shown by the figure. The slip of reed is cut from the mouthpiece against which it lies; the outside end is tied with a thread, and the inside end is left free for vibration. The reed is shaved thin near its fastened end to render it more elastic.
Specimen, Cat. No. 95198 (U.S.N.M.) is a trumpet from Muzmar el Daraweesh, probably made from a rhinoceros horn. It is curved, is lenticular in cross sections, and the bell mouth is bifurcated with notched edges. It has three lugs formed on its outer curved edge, in which are inserted four brass rings. The bore is slightly enlarged at the smaller end to form a cupped mouthpiecé. Length, 20 inches; width, 1 to 5 inches; thickness, $ to 4inch. It is from Cairo.
Fig. 3, plate 68,’ represents an African war trumpet made from the horn of an antelope. The natural cavity of the horn forms the bore of the instrument. The smaller end, however, has not been cut off, but is left pointed as in nature. About one-fourth the distance from the pointed end a lateral opening has been made into the original cavity which forms a mouthpiece, and through this the instrument is blown.
Figs. 6 to 12 in same plate represent war horns from different parts of Africa. They are mostly ivory, and made of elephant’s tusks or rhinoceros horn. The natural cavity of the tusk forms the bore. In some cases the horn has been left in its natural state with a lateral mouth hole cut in the concave side as in the shringa. Others, however, are made by cutting off the end and a direct mouth hole worked out of the solid. The localities of these instruments are indicated in the legends.
Fig. 12, plate 68, represents an elephant tusk 4 feet 4 inches in length on the convex side. It has been carved so as to reduce its size considerably and made much more pointed than natural. At the distance of 33 inches from the large end a lateral opening has been made which forms a mouthpiece. This is elliptical and has been enlarged so as to be cup shaped. From the mouthpiece to the large extremity the natural cavity of the tusk forms the bore of the instrument.
Specimen, Cat. No. 95227 (U.S.N.M.) is a wooden horn (Nanga) from Mayumba, Africa, collected by Mr. Carl Strechelman and received from Mr. George C. Webster. It is carved from a solid block of soft lightcolored wood. The bore is made with a burning iron. The small end has an enlarged cup-shaped mouthpiece. Its smallest diameter is 1 inch. It increases gradually to near the large end, where it expands with a bell mouth to 44 inches. It is 28 inches long. The entire exterior has been originally blackened, apparently by fire, while a section of 11 inches at the larger end is decorated by incised lines cut

No. 174752 (U.S.N.M.) is a whistle of pottery in the form of a hollow cylinder with two projecting lugs from opposite sides, The mouth hole, three-fourths of an inch in diameter, 1s at the upper end. At the opposite end is a finger hole three-sixteenths inch in diameter. There is also a finger hole through one of the lugs. The opposite lug is perforated for suspension. It is sounded by blowing across the larger hole and the different notes produced are as follows: Length, 44 inches; diameter, 15; width across = lugs, 32 inches. Tribe Bakorua, from Sankura, — Africa. Dr. W. L. Abbott describes the “ Ethnological Collections in the United States National Museum from Kilimanjaro, East Africa.”! The locality is thus identified :
A little south of the equator and about 175 miles from the coast of East Africa, rises the splendid mountain Kilimanjaro. It covers an area as great as the Bernese Overland and its greatest peak—Kibo—is over 20,000 feet in height, capped with glaciers and eternal snows. The nearest port on the coast is Mondasa, now the headquarters of the British East African Company.
Dr. Abbott’s paper is illustrated by photographs of this primitive people. The list of musical instruments, all of them from the Wa Changa tribe, Mount Kilimanjaro, Kast Africa, is as follows:
Rattles,—Large iron bell with two balls as sounders; worn by women during pregnancy, on the lower part of the thigh. Length, 4} inches. (Cat. No. 151577, U.S.N.M.)
Rattles.—T'wo small semilunar iron bells, tied to a thong; worn on the ankles. (Cat. No. 151575, U.S.N.M.)
Ankle rattles.—Iron bells, semilunar in shape, with sounders of iron balls, fastened in pairs to a thong of leather and worn on the ankles in dancing. (Cat. No. 151576, U.S.N.M.)
Drum.—Tube of wood closed at one end, with askin head. Used to call the population to arms. It is carried under the left arm and beaten with right hand. Length, 4 feet 2 inches; diameter, 4} inches. (Cat. No. 151584, U.S.N.M.)
Cow bell.—A piece of iron, wrought thin and cut in shape of a dumb-bell, then bent at the center so as to form a rude bell, with a clapper attached to the narrow portion at the top. (Cat. No. 151578, U.S.N.M.)
Cow bell.—Native ironwork, similar to Cat. No. 151578. (Cat. No. 151579, U.S.N.M.)
Fig. 198 a, b, represents one of three rattles from Mayumba, Africa. (Collected by Mr. Carl Strechelman.) Its length is 34 inches, width, 1%,
and thickness, 1{ inches. It is double—that is, with rattle at each end, —
intended to be held in the middle. It is of dark-colored soft wood, the outside charred and then ornamented by incised lines in squares, parallels, chevrons, herringbones, etc. Fig. 198a represents a complete drawing, while fig. 198) is a longitudinal section showing the interior construction, the formation of the double bell, the clappers of wood, three in number within each bell, and their attachment by an endless

Fig. 199 represents the Pandean pipes, or Pipes of Pan, from the Fiji Islands. (Collected by Mr. J. M. Brower, United States consul.) Four pieces of cane of different lengths are placed together parallel and fastened by fine wire which has been passed around each of the four and then drawn into several strands between each cane respectively,

dark-redwood. The bottom is convex like a cask or barrel. No head of skin is used, as in all drums of modern manufacture. When used it is placed on a coil of rope. It is from Somu-Somu, Fiji, and was collected by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. It is 55 inches in length, 16 inches in width, and 18 inches in height. The native name for this instrument is lali, and the following description is taken from the label displayed in the United States National Museum:
The tavola tree of Fiji (Terminalia catappa) is said to make the best sounding lalis, although the vesi tree (Afzelia bijuga) is also used. ‘‘The sides are beaten by two sticks about 18 inches long. In different ways.measures or tunes are beaten on them, the meaning of which is known by the natives and the ‘old hands’ or settlers. The sound of the lali is not unpleasant when beaten by a practiced hand, and a good-sounding one may be heard at a distance — of 4 or 5 miles on a quiet evening.”—(Horne, A Year in Fiji, p. 114.)
Commodore Wilkes, in his Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition, states that this drum was given to him by Tiu Thakau, a chief of the island of Somu Somu, together with a thousand yams, in exchange for a musket—the usual price—and a whale’s tooth in token of friendship. ‘(After the drum had been presented to me,” he continues, ‘I was desirous of hearmg them beat upon it. They have several beats or calls to give notice to the koro (or village), one of which was for calling the people together to the feast of human bodies. They were all distinct and, they said, quite audible at a great distanee. The Fiji drum is similar to that described at Tonga, and is made of a log hollowed out and placed on one point. It gives ont a deep, hollow tone when struck with the small and large sticks with which they produce the different sounds.”—(Vol. III, p. 317.)

Specimen, Cat. No. 3825 (U.S.N.M.) is a war horn from Carlshoff Island. It is made from a coneb. shell (Triton trinonis Linnzus) and is covered with a lime deposit.
An extremely primitive instrument in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 95554) is marked Los Huesos, (the bones) Spain, but otherwise the record is silent. It is a rattle of eightleg bones of a sheep, each perforated near the ends and strung on two cords, making

the instrument like a ladder. The sound is made by the bones being rasped one or both ways with another bone or piece of shell. Length, 43 inches; width, 5 inches.
The United States National Museum possesses several primitive, if not entirely prehistoric, musical instruments, gathered by divers perSons, most of them operating in the line of ethnology or prehistoric archeology, not a few of whom have been officers of the United States Government who have turned over their collections to the Museum on returning to Washington.
Pursuing a plan of description by geographic distribution, we begin at the extreme north.
Point Barrow.—Mr. John Murdoch, in his paper on the Point Barrow Eskimo,! says:
The only musical instrument among these people is the universal drum or tambourine (Aelyau), consisting of a membrane stretched over a hoop with a handle on one side. It is used from Greenland to Siberia. It is always accompanied by the voice, singing or chanting. It produced a loud, resonant, and somewhat musical note. There appears to be no system of tuning these drums, the pitch of the note depending entirely upon accident.
Mr. Murdoch figures one of these, here reproduced as fig. 200, which is simply a hoop like that of a tambourine, oval, 22 by 19 inches, with a short handle attached. The membrane is a sheet of the peritoneum of a seal stretched over a hoop after the style of a tambourine. The United States National Museum possesses four of these drums, of which Mr. Murdoch says that ‘‘every Eskimo household possesses at least one.”
The expedition brought home eight handles for these drums which exhibit but slight variations. The commonest material for the handle is walrus ivory; only two out of twelve are of antler. Their length is from 4.6 to 5.4 inches. Fig. 201 a-d represents a series of these drum handles taken from Mr. Murdoch’s paper. With one exception, all these handles have the large end more or less rudely carved into a human face with the mouth open as if singing. The one exception is fig. c, which is the butt end of a small walrus tusk carved to represent a walrus. It has small oval bits of wood inlaid for eyes. The notches by which these handles are fitted into the rim of the tam-

Many objects are strung on strings and tied to the belt, notably on little boys; often a small brass bell is thus attached.

The string or loop by which it was attached is shown in the figure. We can imagine the music made by this instrument when attached to the belt of a running, jumping, playing boy. It serves the same purpose in music as does the dulcimer, which, by the latest fad of society people, is hung upon the door of the young ladies’ boudoir, with bullets suspended from long

strings, which, being agitated by the closing door, strike the wires, making music whenever the door is moved.
Mr. Murdoch! gives a better report of the musical abilities of the Point Barrow Eskimo. He says:
Their music consists of monotonous chants, usually with very little perceptible air, and pitched generally in a minor key. I could not perceive that they had any idea of ‘‘tune,” in the musical sense, but when several sang together each pitched the tune to suit himself. They, however, keep excellent time. The ordinary songs are in ‘‘common” or 4-4 time. The words are often extemporaneous, and at tolerable regular intervals comes the refrain, ‘‘A yana, yana, a yana ya,” which takes the place of the ‘‘4mna aja” of the eastern Eskimo. Sometimes, when they are humming or singing to themselves, the words are nothing but this refrain, Their voices, as a general thing, are musical.
Like all Eskimo, they are very fond of music, and are constantly singing and humming to themselves, sometimes, according to Captain Herendeen, waking up in the night to sing. Besides their regular festivals they often

ing usually very quick and acute ears, readily catch the tunes, which they sing with curiously mutilated words. We found ‘‘Shoo fly” and ‘‘Little Brown Jug” great favorites at the time of our arrival, and one old woman from Nuwitk told us with great glee how Magwa (McGuire) used to sing ‘‘Tolderolderol.” Our two violins, the doctor’s and the cook’s, were a constant source of delight to them.
Mr. L. M. Turner,’ speaking of the Hudson Bay Eskimo, says:
The only musical instrument used by these people is the drum or tambourine of the form shown. These drums vary in diameter from 22 to 26 inches. The membrane for the drumhead is a thin reindeer skin tanned.
Fig. 203 represents one of these drums from Nenenot.
Across the membrane is stretched a sinew cord on which are strung at right angles to the cord a number of barrels, made from the quills of the wing feathers of the
willow ptarmigan. Across the underside of the membrane is stretched a similar cord with quills.
Mr. Turner figures and describes a similar drum used by the Little Whale River Indians, which drums, he says, differ greatly in construction from those of the Ungava Indians.
The size is rarely so great, seldom exceeding 22 inches. These drums have two

heads or membranes, fitted on the barrel and secured by a single hoop for each head. The two hoops are then connected by tightening strings. The membranes are invariably made of deerskin in the parchment condition and not of tanned skins.
The snares or thongs across the heads have pieces of wood instead of quills as rattlers. The drumstick, like that of the Ungavas, is of reindeer horn, or else, as if to add to the din, a gun-cap box is pierced through from side to side and a few pebbles or shot placed within. A stick is then inserted through the hole in the box, and the whole covered with buckskin to prevent separation of the lid and box. This makes a distracting noise.
Turner, describing the use of the drum, says:
Nothing is done, nothing contemplated, without sounding the drum. It is silent only when the people are asleep or on a tramp from one locality to another. If a person is ill the drum is beaten; if a person is well the drum is beaten; if prosperous in the chase a drum is beaten, and if death has snatched a member from the community the drum is beaten to prevent his spirit from returning to torment the living. The drumbeat is often accompanied with singing, which is the most discordant of all sounds supposed to be harmonious.
“The Indians of the Northwest Coast” is the title of a paper by Lieut. Albert P. Niblack, U.S. N., based on collections in the United States National Museum and on personal observation in connection with the survey of Alaska in the seasons of 1885, 1886, and 1887. The locality most affected was the coast and islands in southern Alaska and northern British Columbia, The musical instruments which he found were drums, whistles, and rattles, which are described in his paper.!
Drums.—The usual type of drum is that shown on plate 70 (his plate LVII), which consists of a piece of deerhide or sheepskin stretched across a circular wooden hoop. They are similar, though not identical, with the drum of the Point Barrow and Hudson Bay Eskimo heretofore described. It has the bear asa totem. It is beaten with an ordinary bass drumstick.
Whistles—Whistles are shown in great variety on plates 71 and 72 (his plates LXT and LXII). Some of these devices make a hideous noise, especially such as fig. 1 (plate 71), consisting of a wooden whistle and a bladder like a toy balloon, or fig. 2 (plate 71), a whistle backed by a pair of bellows to furnish the wind. The most elaborate instrument of this kind is shown in figs. 3 and 4 (plate 71), both being views of the same; the former put together ready for use, the latter showing the pieces in detail. It consists of six pieces of wood, forming a kind of trumpet with five openings, a continuous narrow band of silk being stretched through these openings. It is blown from the small end, trumpetfashion, when each section gives forth its sound on a different pitch. Figs. 1 and 2 (plate 72) are views of the same kind of instrument blown flute fashion. The other instruments are like a flageolet, some of them having several finger holes to change the notes. Fig. 3 (plate 72

has a reed or vibrating piece within, as shown in the sectional view (fig. 4).
Rattles.—These are usually of cedar, generally in sections neatly joined, elaborately carved, and painted with appropriate totem designs. The usual form is a hollow wooden chamber with a dozen or more small pebbles in it. The most primitive mentioned by the early voyagers is composed of two hoops joined by a wooden crosspiece, the circumference being closely strung with the beaks of the puffin.—(His fig. 73, plate X VIII.)
Lieutenant Niblack witnessed one of the great ceremonial dances of these people at Fort Wrangell, September, 1887. Describing their musi¢ and musical instruments,! he says:
It consisted in raising the feet alternately in quick succession as high as possible, without moving the body, to the sound of a drum, chorus, and rattle.
He quotes Dawson’s description of a dance:
Some had rattles, and added to the din by shaking these furiously at the accentuated parts of the song. * * * The drum was beaten very regularly with double knocks, thus—tum tum, tum tum, tum tum—and with the sound the dancers kept time in a sort of chant orsong. * * *
And from Laugadorff:?
One of the dancers seems, as it were, to lead the rest, carrying in his hand a thick sort of staff ornamented with the teeth of sea otters, which he struck upon the ground to mark the measure. ; The women sit on the ground at a distance of some paces from the dancers and sing a not inharmonious melody, which supplies the music.
Drums, rattles, and whistles—Capt. P. H. Ray made an extensive ethnological collection from the Indians in the Hupa Reservation, which is described by Professor Mason in the Smithsonian Report for 1886.°
Speaking of the musicai instruments, he says:
Rattles employed by medicine men and in gambling are composed of many hoofs and hooflets of the blacktail deer. Each piece is pierced through the apex and suspended on a short thread, upon which four white beads are also strung. These pendants are then fastened to a long belt of cloth or leather and worn around the waist or held in the hand. The hoofs striking together produce a sharp rattling sound. A small, graceful lens-shaped rattle, mounted on a stick, is held in the hand of the dancer. (Fig. 114, plate 73. His plate XX VI.)
The Hupa drum is a rectangular box, covered with leather, and has little merit as a musical instrument. (ig. 118, plate 73. His plate XXVI.)
The Hupa make tolerably agreeable music on a small bone whistle, made either single or double. (Figs. 115-117, plate 73. His plate XXVI.)
Professor Mason concludes with the statement that by the similarity of these with the prehistoric instruments found in the ancient graves

of southern California and the islands of the coast the continuity of music in prehistoric times is made out, and he wisely observes (p. 235) :
It is an important principle, which archeologists sometimes overlook, that arts may survive and obey the laws of technic evolution even though the men through whose instrumentality they live and have their being have no immediate blood relationship.
To which the author is tempted to add that the survival of identical arts among peoples widely separated by time or space is not evidence of independent discovery or separate invention. The underlying idea of Professor Mason’s statement is that this survival of similar arts must have been by teaching of some sort which could only have been accomplished by contact or communication intermediate between the peoples. While a similarity of arts (or of language) is not evidence of consanguinity between different peoples, yet it is evidence of a high order, sufficient in the absence of anything to the contrary, to carry conviction that there has been communication between them of some sort.
Bone whistles or flageolets.—-There are in the Museum a number of bone whistles or flageolets, obtained from ancient graves on the California coast and the adjacent islands. The majority are made of the long bones of birds. The simpler forms are plain tubes of various lengths, one end being closed with asphaltum. In others a square or oval vent hole is cut; in most cases near one end, but sometimes nearer the middle. In many specimens there is a transverse ridge of asphaltum Beet fastened to the inside of the tube immediately below Wig 30k the hole, which deflects the current of air over the edge — soxe wusrze. of the hole and makes the musical tone as in a flageolet. *2™t2 Cruz Island,

In fig. 205 is shown an instrument from La Patera, Santa Barbara County, on the mainland. Dr. C. C. Abbott,! speaking of this specimen, says:

from one end a square hole has been cut in the bone, and just beneath it is a transverse ridge of asphaltum. A note or sound is obtained by blowing into the end nearest the vent hole.

Fig. 207 represents a bone whistle from an ancient grave on San Miguel Island, California (Bowers collection). It is made from a tibia of the deer (Cariacus virginianus). The upper end has been cut off, the cellular portion of the bone removed, and a side hole placed about 13 inches from the open end. Opposite this opening and extending to the end on the inside are remains of gum or asphaltum, which formed an air passage on the principle of the modern flageolet. By restoring this with clay, I was enabled to get a sound or note on the instrument thus: San
There are two other whistles of like form from Santa Cruz Island (Cat. Nos. 26273 and 26274 U.S.N.M.), but so much cracked and weathered that no attempt was made at restoration.
Fig. 208 represents one of three instruments lately received from Mr. J. Neale Plumb, of New York. They are from San Clemente Island, and were obtained by Mr. Plumb during the summer of 1895 while exploring the shell heaps and graves on the isiand. There were five of these instruments found together in one grave. These are also made from the tibia of a deer, but, unlike the whistle just described, the lower or smaller end of the bone is cut away to form the mouthpiece.

This has been carefully worked and smoothed all around. The side or vent hole is about an inch from the end. Small pieces of gum forming the air passage still adhere to the inside of the tube. There are no finger holes, and consequently only one tone could be produced. On the outside are traces of asphaltum, evidently used to hold in place a wrapping of some kind, and near the larger end an ornament made from a piece of iridescent Haliotis shell is held in place by the same material. The instruments found by Mr. Plumb are of unequal lengths, show no traces of asphaltum on the larger end as do the Schumacher specimens (fig. 209), and they were probably intended to be used singly. These were described by Prof. E. 8S. Holden.!
In the graves on the island of Santa Catalina, Schumacher?’ found

<<<Page: 766>>>

eight double whistles or pipes, and on San Clemente, one, which is here represented as fig. 209. These were made from the tibia of a deer, joined together and held in position by having the lower ends inserted in a mass of asphaltum and then wound with bark, which in its turn was covered with asphaltum and extending nearly the entire length of the instrument. At the distance of an inch and a quarter from the open end were vent holes, one in each bone, with a mass or bridge of asphaltum placed inside in such positions and of such size as to leave but a small space for air. The open ends of both instruments were inserted in the mouth, and it was doubtless blown flageolet fashion.
A bone fife or flageolet is represented by fig. 210, which, being without mouthpiece, is simply a bone cylinder as represented, with four finger holes, and was made from the femur of a bird. Contrary to the foregoing specimen (fig. 209), it is very white and highly polished, with a uniform thickness. It was obtained by Mr. Schumacher from a grave on Santa Cruz Island.
Fig. 211 represents an instrument made from the ulna of the brown pelican. It is without mouthpiece, but has four small finger holes. It is from San Miguel Island, California, and was collected by Mr. W. H. Dall. The ends are so much weathered and broken that it is impossible to say of what the whistling apparatus consisted. There are, however, in the Ethnological Museum collection bone flageolets from Costa Rica (see fig. 273), identical in Shape with the one just mentioned and giving a Series of musical tones. In these the mouthpiece is at the larger end, which is filled with gum or asphaltum, leaving an air passage which connects with a vent hole about 14 inches distant. It seems probable that the California specimens were constructed in the same way, but they have become fragile by age and other causes, and in only one or two instances can any tone be produced.
The following list will give the additional instruments in the United States National Museum, the catalogue numbers, with the kind of instrument and the locality where found, collected principally by Messrs. Schumacher and Bowers:

Fig. 212 represents a double flute from the McCloud River Reservation, Shasta County, California (received from Livingstone Stone). The tubes are of soft wood, resembling elder stalk, with bark and pith removed. There are four finger holes in each tube, made with a burning iron. There is no sign of the use of asphaltum, nor is there any

mouthpiece. Both tubes are open from end to end, and it is suggested that they have been blown upon not as a flageolet, but across the hole in the open end of the tube instead of across the lateral hole in the side. What use the four finger holes were is quite undetermined, for, while they are not too great in number, they are so far apart that no person can cover them all at the same time.
Drums and rattles—There seems to have been among the California aborigines, whether ancient or modern, an almost total absence of these instruments or any musical instruments of percussion.
Capt. George M. Wheeler, United States Engineer in charge of the geographical survey west of the one hundredth meridian, and principally on the coast of southern California, made, or caused to be made, extensive archeological investigations into the prehistoric occupation on the Pacific coast of southern California, especially among the islands. This expedition had the aid of persons at that time the best qualified in the United States to make such investigations. The result was published in Volume VII of the series, and is entitled “Archeology.” In the introduction (p. 26), is found the following:
“ALATA NAGOOM ATANI0a
In the way of musical entertainments it is evident that the Californians were limited to very primitive instruments, the only kinds that have been found in the graves consisting of whistles made of bones of animals. Some of these, however, exhibit considerable ingenuity, and it may be that they were played upon with skill.
This statement is verified by Mr. W. H. Dall, verbally, whose opinion and observation is entitled to great weight because he had, prior to tin ‘hy that time, made elaborate and extensive ethae i nologic investigations among the aborigines of Alaska, prehistoric and modern, where he had found such an extensive and almost universal use of the drum.
The United States National Museum possesses neither drums nor rattles from the southern coast of California, and as for rattles, while they are rare, those which are found belong to modern Indians far in the interior. They are also pecuhar in their construction and quite different from those found elsewhere among the aborigines.

San Diego, California, collected by Mr. Edward Palmer. The finder reports it as a doll and not an idol nor a rattle. The lower part is spherical; a small orifice is shown in front; through this have been pushed two little pebbles a quarter of an inch in diameter. Whether the insertion of these pebbles was intentional or accidental, we have no means of knowing, nor is it known whether their insertion changed the character of the instrument in the intention of the maker from a doll to a musical instrument. The walls of the sphere are solid and | quite thick, and not calculated to give off much sound, and, while the rattling of the two pebbles can be heard, yet they sound but faintly and can be heard only a short distance. The more it is examined, the less:certain is the conclusion that it was ever intended as a rattle. Another item is that the protuberances representing ears have been pierced and, though the right ear has been pulled out and the string lost, yet in the left ear the hole is perfect and contains a string of white and green glass beads alternated. This would seem almost decisive in favor of the object having been a doll and not a rattle, though it may have been used for both.

The natural hollow of the bone forms the bore of the instrument, and is nearly filled with asphaltum at the vent hole, apparently for the purpose of reducing its size and giving the necessary vibrations when blown through the upper end. This asphaltum has so far deteriorated or become degraded as that the instrument will emit only an imperfect

It is of cedar, has been made in halves so as to work out the interior, and is then gummed, put together, and bound tightly by ten different strands of buckskin, which serve to keep it in place. They are each wound three or four times around and tied in hard knots, except that over the vent hole, which forms a bowknot, all the ends being allowed to hang, as shown in the figure. Its length is 18 inches; its diameter, interior =; inch, exterior 14, inches. It has six finger holes put about equal distances apart and in the same relation to each other as in the white man’s ordinary flageolet. The mouth hole is in the upper end and has been carved out of the solid, as represented in the figure. There is little doubt that this is a modern Indian instrument. Its scale is as follows:

Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, in a paper entitled “ Native American stringed musical instruments,”! remarks:
It is generally stated that the American Indians at the time of the discovery did not use anywhere on the continent a stringed instrument. I have found, however, four examples which seem to controvert this, and I give them in the hope that the readers in The Antiquarian will be able to add to their number.
He describes one as the “Apache fiddle,” a small stringed instrument of one cord. The specimen is in the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.
‘American Antiquarian, January, 1897, NAT MUS 96——37

<<<Page: 773>>>

The resonator is a hollow reed about a foot in length, over which is stretched a strand composed of six or eight horse hairs. The strand is, at one end, wrapped around a movable crossbar, which allows it to be tightened at will. The cord is sounded by means of a bow with a horsehair string. There is some doubt whether this is a genuine aboriginal invention.
Another example is taken from Adair’s History of the American Indians (p. 175), who relates that in 1746 he was among the “ MississippiNachee” Indians and witnessed a performance ‘‘on one of their old sacred musical instruments, * * * 5 feet long and a foot wide on the head of the board, with eight strings made out of the sinews of a large buffalo.” It was played with a bow which was managed by two Indians, one at each end.
Another is the “ quijongo” of Central America:
A monocord, made by fastening a wooden bow with a stretched cord over the mouth of a gourd or jar, which serves as a resonator. The bow is usually a hollow reed about 5 feet long, and the resonator is attached at one-third the distance from oneend. ‘The string is then bent down and fastened to the mouth of the jar. The notes are produced by striking the two sections of the string with a light stick, and at the same time the opening of the jar is more or less closed by the palm of the hand, thus producing a variety in the notes.
His fourth is a specimen from the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and is described as a reed about 5 feet long, with a jar fastened at the middle point, above which is a bridge. To this are attached four strings of different lengths. The specimen is labeled as from the Upper Purus River, Brazil, “ Apurman Indians.” But Dr. Brinton adds:
No such tribe and no such instrument are mentioned by Martius, Markham, Ehrenreich, Von den Steinen, or Polak, soI can add nothing to the information on the label.
Very nearly all interest in the foregoing as aboriginal stringed musical instruments is taken away by Dr. Brinton’s last paragraph:
It is possible that in all these cases the instruments were borrowed with modifications from the whites or negroes; but there is sufficient probability that they were aboriginal American inventions to make their further study desirable. The stringed instrument sometimes found in Central America, made by stretching cords over the concave carapace of an armadillo, or turtle, must be modern, as it has no native name in either Maya or Nahuatl.
Professor Mason is sure that the aboriginal tribes of America had no stringed musical instrument whatever.
Rowbotham! says that the North American Indians were able to record their music by cutting notches in sticks, and he cites Schoolcraft, I,Chap. VI. He figures one of these sticks, declaring that the rise and fall of the tone necessary to produce the melody is indicated by the position of the notches, that a rising slope indicated a raise of the tone, this as they proceeded from left to right; and that a declivity of the notch or stick indicated a lowering of the tone, and that the abruptness in each case of the slope indicated the rapidity with which the rise or fall should be made. He also cites Kohl’s Wanderings Around Lake Superior, ge 21200); and Tylor’s History of Mee , page 157.

Whistles (limonite concretions).—Certain whistles have been found, principally in Missouri, which belong to the epoch of the Mound Builders or are surely pre-Columbian.
They are limonite concretions which have been opened at one end, presumably where the crust is thinnest, the clay nucleus has been removed so as to leave a hollow interior and the opened end of the shell ground to a beveled edge, moderately sharp and thin, so that being blown against it produces a sound. The United States National Museum possesses a series of four of these.

larger objects, the most plausible being that by the medicine man for the pretended cure of disease. Their use for smoking or as whistles or calls has also been suggested. By proper manipulation they will emit a sound which can be heard for quite a distance, and it is possible they were used for that purpose. This remark applies to the tubes which have cylindrical holes drilled almost the entire length and then finished with one of smaller diameter (Nos. 1 to 8, plate 74), and also to the class which have biconical holes, having been drilled from both ends (Nos. 9 to 11, plate 74), and then scooped out with a tool so that the hole conforms somewhat to the outline and is smallest in the center. No. 12 shows one of this class broken before the enlarging process had been begun. These objects, if musical instruments, were not whistles but trumpets, for the sound can only be made by blowing in the same manner as are instruments of that class. The materials are usually soapstone, banded slate, and chlorite, although specimens of sandstone are not wanting.

It is not at all certain that these are musical instruments, or were ever used as such, or if used it was other than sporadic or accidental. They are figured among the musical instruments for several reasons: (1) While the various uses have been suggested or surmised, no definite use has ever been discovered, and if not musical instruments, they are to be classed as unknown, or, aS Dr. Rau says, enigmas; (2) they can be made to produce a sound by being blown trumpet fashion; (3) they have been claimed or classed as trumpets or horns for the making of signals or calls, as the trumpet calls of an army or encampment.

<<<Page: 781>>>

General Thruston,' speaking of stone tubes of hourglass form, quotes the following from Judge Haywood’s History of Tennessee:
When the stone trumpet is blown through, it makes a sound that can be heard, perhaps, 2 miles, and that probably it was used for similar purposes to those for
Fig. 222. FRAGMENTS OF WOODEN FLUTE.
Colorado. Nordenskiéld, Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde, p. 101, fig. 64.
This remark would seem to apply equally as well to
which the trumpets of the Israelites were used, namely, principally to convene assemblies and to regulate the movements of an army.
General Thruston’s experience with these tubes does not seem to have been satisfactory, for he adds:
We have exhausted our blowing powers upon two similar ‘stone trumpets” in our collection without eliciting any satisfactory response in the way of music or noise, and we scarcely think it possible that these tubular objects could have been designed ‘‘for martial music,” as stated.
No expression of opinion is here made as to the correctness of these claims, but we have not ignored or rejected them. To do so would be to decide the question adversely and cut off further argument. It is deemed wiser to insert the figures of these objects, calling attention to their claims as musical instruments, to the possible end that future investigators may discover something concerning their use and thus be enabled to settle the question. So far as the writer can discover in the published descriptions of these objects, their use as musical instruments is rarely advanced.
Mr. W. H. Holmes,’ in speaking of the pottery of the ancient Pueblos, says:
The ancient people had not devoted their ceramic art to trivial uses; there are no toys, no rattles, and no grotesque figures.

a lateral hole and possibly used as a whistle. Speaking of these two
objects, he says:!
Among the wooden objects, some fragments of a flute found in Spring House should also be mentioned. The flute was made of a bough. Its diameter was 2.5 centimeters. The longest fragment measured 45 centimeters and was pierced with three holes. In asmaller fragment, which could not
be fitted together with the rest, was a trace of a fourth hole. Of the bone object he says (description of plate XLI): The above figure shows a bone implement pierced
with a little hole, and perhaps used as a whistle.

There seems to be no reason why the use ascribed to these objects by Professor Nordenskiéld should not be accepted. A people with an art culture so highly developed in other directions might easily have invented and used musical instruments.
The following descriptions of musical instruments from the Pueblos are intended merely for comparison, or for showing certain resemblances of form between them and objects of the same class from other

Quite a number of articles of this group may perhaps be properly classed as “ancient,” and were obtained more or less uninjured.
And also (pp. 335, 336) that the
ornaments and musical instruments employed in dances and religious ceremonies do not differ much among the Pueblo Indians, the principal ones being the drum, rattles made from gourds, notched sticks, a kind of flute, and a turtle-shell rattle.
Drums.—Fig. 224 represents one of these instruments. Mr. Stevenson’s description (p. 398, fig. 581) is as follows:
A flat drum made by stretching goat hide over a wide hoop and tightened by lacing crosswise around the edge with acord of the same material. One side is plain, the other is decorated with a figure which is not interpreted. This specimen is from Shinumo, but it does not differ from those used by many of the other tribes.

turtle is carefully removed from the shell, leaving it hollow. To the edges of the breastplate are attached the toes of goats or sheep. These toes, coming in contact with the hollow shell, produce a peculiar sound, in keeping with the sound caused by the gourd rattles used in the same ceremony. The rattle is fastened to the rear of the right leg near the knee when employed in the dances.

Wind instruments.—
The wind instruments from the Pueblo Indians here mentioned are of two classes: (1) Direct flutes or hollow tubes of wood, blown across one end; (2) instruments which have a mouthpiece, made on the same principle as the modern flageolet.
Specimen, Cat. No. 69192 (U.S.N.M.) is one of the first class (Le-na). It is a hollow cylinder of wood with five finger holes, three in one group and two in the other. One end of the tube is beveled from the inside, making a sharp edge, against which the air is forced when blown. From Hopi, Arizona. Length, 274 inches; diameter, 14 inches.
A sacred flute (Shoh-Koonne), Cat. No. 69312 (U.S.N.M.), is from Zubi, New Mexico, and is blown in the same manner as the preceding. It is made from a slightly tapering reed, and has four finger holes arranged in pairs widely separated. On the

Fig. 232 is an instrument made of pottery, lately received by the National Museum from Mr. H. D. Thompson, of Moline, Llinois. Its remarkable similarity to specimens from Central and South America was deemed of sufficient importance to justify a description in this paper. According to Mr. Thompson, it was found seyeral feet below the surface in the Mississippi River drift while excavating for a factory foundation. It is the only specimen of its kind found in the eastern or central United States that has thus far come to our notice. Its shape is that of an animal head (somewhat cat-like). By referring to the sketch it will be seen that the whistling mechanism is in the mouth of the animal and the eyes served as sound or finger holes. Unfortunately the mouthpiece is broken and the original seale of the instrument can not be given. Three notes, however, were possible. Pottery whistles of bird and animal shapes are

MEXxIco.
Music evidently occupied a prominent place in the arts of the ancient Mexicans, for it is mentioned by the early Spanish writers in connection with war, religious ceremonies, and festivals of various kinds. The instruments described or mentioned were drums, timbals, flutes, horns, trumpets, and rattles. According to Clavigero,' they had no stringed instruments.
Of their use in war or military movements Bernal Diaz? relates:
We saw the enemy in the plain in our front, advancing against us, sounding their trumpets, horns, and drums.
Again he says (p. 297):
Before we arrived at our quarters and while the enemy were pursuing us, we heard their shrill timbals and the dismal sound of the great drum from the top of the great temple of the god of war, which overlooked the whole city.
Clavigero* also mentions the use of musical instruments in war:
They began the battle (as was usual in ancient Europe and among the Romans) with a most terrible noise of warlike instruments, shouting and whistling, which struck terror to those not accustomed to hear it.
Of the religious music in charge of the priests the same author says (p. 43):
The Ometochtli was the chief composer of the hymns which were sung at festivals; * * * the Tlapixcatzin, the master of the chapel, who not only appointed the music, but superintended the singing and corrected the singers.
Of songs and dances Don Antonio de Mendoza, in a second letter * to Emperor Charles V, says:
Indians accompanying their dances and songs with flutes marked at the places where fingers are to be placed. The flutes are of different sizes. The singers beat time as with us. They sing in accord with those playing.
Prescott,’ in speaking of the domestic manners of the Atzecs, says:
As soon as they had finished their repast the young people rose from the table to close the festivities of the day with dancing. They danced gracefully to the sound of various instruments, accompanying their movements with chants of a pleasing, though somewhat plaintive character.

Drums (teponaztli).—There is no representative of the ancient Mexiean drum in the United States National Museum, and those here shown in fig. 253 a,b, are copied from the work of Carl Engel.! His description is as follows:
The teponaztli of the Aztecs is generally made of a single block of very hard
wood, somewhat eblong square in shape, which they hollowed, leaving at each end asolid piece about 3 or 4 inches in thickness, and at its upper side a kind of sound-

board, about a quarter of an inch in thickness. In this sound-board, if it may be cailed so, they made three incisions, namely, two running parallel some distance lengthwise of the drum, and a third running across from one of these to the other,
just in the center. ] By this means they obtained two vibrating tongues of wood, which, when beaten with a stick, produced sounds as clearly defined as those of our kettledrums. By making one of the tongues thinner than the other,
‘A Descriptive Catalogue of the Musical Instruments in the Kensington Museum, p. 77, fig. 65.

<<<Page: 789>>>

they insured two different sounds, the pitch of which they were enabled to regulate by shaving off more or less wood. The bottom of the drum they cut almost entirely open. The traveler M. Nebel was told by archeologists in Mexico that these instruments always contained the interval of a third, but on examining several specimens which he saw in museums, he found some in which the two sounds stood toward each other in the relation of a fourth, while in others they constituted a fifth, in others a sixth, and in some even an octave. This is noteworthy, inasmuch as it points to a conformity with our diatonic series of intervals, excepting the seventh.
The teponaztli was generally carved with fanciful and ingenious designs. It was beaten with two drumsticks covered at the end with an elastic gum called ule, which was obtained from the milky juice extracted from the Mexican ule tree. Some of these drums were so

ful that it could be heard at a distance of 3 miles. In some rare instances a specimen of the teponaztli is still preserved by the Indians in Mexico, especially among tribes who have been comparatively but little affected by intercourse with their European aggressors. Rattles (ayacachtli).—The rattle appears to have occupied an important place in the ceremonies of the ancient Mexicans. In construction it was similar to the rattles commonly used by the Indians of the present day, which are round or oval in shape and usually made of a gourd, into which is inserted a wooden handle. A number of small pebbles were inclosed in the hollowed gourd.! Rattles made of pottery were also used, and there are in the Museum quite a number of these ancient instruments. Fig. 234 represents one of a series—the simplest form (Batchelor collection). Itis round and the outer surface is ornamented with incised line decoration in panellike designs.

is quite simple, consisting of lines and dots in black. The sound of this rattle is clear and distinet—similar to that of metallic bells.
A recent addition to the Museum (Cat. No. 196675, U.S.N.M., Phillips collection), is a gourd-shaped rattle modeled in grayish colored clay, the neck or handle representing a grotesque human head. The globular part containing clay pellets is divided in the same manner

as the preceding (fig. 235), and in addition there are two small holes placed on opposite sides of the chamber in a line transverse to the division or slit. The clay is not well baked and the sound is rather feeble.
Additional specimens of earthenware rattles in the United States National Museum not figured are as follows:

There are a number of broken pottery instruments or objects in the United States National Museum which at first sight were thought to have been rattles. They are in the form of a slightly tapering tube, varying in length from 2 feet to 6 inches, and in diameter from 13 to 14 inches. In some of these a serpent or reptile’s head containing a clay pellet is represented at one end, as shown in fig. 236. The clay is well tempered and the sound produced quite brilliant. Recent accessions from Mexico, however, furnish evidence that the above are handles of vessels used in religious ceremonies (incense burners?), the rattle probably serving an accessory purpose. Among the objects recently found by Mr. Edward Palmer in a burial cave at Dos Caminos, 25 miles east of Acapulco, were twenty-nine fragments. Ten of these are the upper part of handles with a portion of the bowl still attached, and nineteen are the lower ends terminating in heads of reptiles. One vessel has been sufficiently restored to indicate its character, and is here

<<<Page: 791>>>

introduced as fig. 237. It is in the form of an open-work bowl, the outside being ornamented with panel-like designs in low relief. A long hollow handle projects from one side, which may have terminated with a rattle, as shown in fig. 236. The similarity of these pieces or handles to the ones already possessed by the Museum was immediately recognized, and with the bowl-shaped additions lately received their identity was established. Pictographs representing certain religious ceremonies in which are priests holding like instruments are given by Chavero.!
Of the use of incense burners by the Mexican priests, Clavigero’ Says:
For incense they generally make use of copal, or some other aromatic gum, The censers were commonly made of clay, but they had also censers of gold.
Instruments similar to the foregoing are in the museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

the various objects which the Aztecs used to pay as tribute to their sovereigns. One of these bells is shown in fig. 239. Mr. W. H. Holmes, in “Ancient Art in the Province of Chiriqui,”! says:
A question as to the authenticity of these bells naturally arises, and it may be difficult to show to the satisfaction of the skeptical mind that any particular specimen is not of European origin or inspiration. At the same time we are not without strong evidences (historical and otherwise) that such bells were in use by the Americans before the advent of the whites. * * * The form originated, no doubt, in the rattle, at first a nutshell or a gourd; later it was modeled in clay. With the acknowledged skill of these people in the working of metals, there is no reason why the bells described should not have been manufactured independently of European aid and influence, provided the requisite metal was at hand. It should be observed that, if these early American bells were copied from or based upon Spanish originals, they would not vary greatly in type with the various sections from which they are recovered, but it is observed that marked and persistent differences do occur. The
well-known Mexican bell, an example of which is here outlined in fig. 44 , although of bronze, is gencrically distinct in form and construction.
Similar bells in the United States National Museum not figured are

Whistles or flageolets (pottery).—The ancient instruments of the class which are here to be described form a most interesting series; not only those from Mexico, but the similar ones from Central and South America. They show in some degree the progress which the aborigines had made in the arts, and that a musical system, however crude, had been attained. The whistling mechanism in all is identical with that of the modern flageolet, and the only distinction that can be made between them is by classing the instruments which only emit one sound or note, as whistles, and those which have one or more

are mostly grotesque caricatures of the human face or figure or of animals or birds. The larger instruments are more like the modern flageolet. Fig. 240 represents one of the smaller class. The body of this is a short tube with one end closed. A prolongation at right angles to the tube forms the mouthpiece, and on the upper part, where the two are joined, is placed a figure representing a bird with two heads. It is modeled in grayish-colored clay, unpainted. Closing the end hole will give the lower note, when opened the higher one, as seen in the accompanying

Professor Kollman! figures and describes instruments of this and other Mexican types in a paper entitled ‘“‘Fléten und Pfeifen aus AltMexiko” (in the Festschrift published by Riemer in Berlin in commemoration of the seventieth birthday of Adolf Bastian.) These instruments form part of a series of Mexican antiquities belonging to the ethnographic collection in Basel. They were obtained in Mexico by Henri Lukas Vischer during the years 1828-1837. <A translation, most kindly furnished by Mr. H. von Bayer, of Professor Kollman’s description of the double-headed bird whistles, is as follows:
On the fife (fig. 4) there is an imitation of a prairie hen (Bonasa cupido). Another fife of our collection shows a pair of these hens united similar to the double eagle, as shown in fig. 5. The animals are represented in a live attitude; the wings are spread, the head and tail held up, as if preparing torise. Regarding the significance of these representations, both of the single and double bird, I fail to find any clew for explanation. Perhaps it is intended to indicate the true wedded life of men or of gods, since those hens live, as is known, monogamous, as do many other species of wild fowl. Perhaps they express some motives,

double eagle on the fife spreading the wings, with the tail raised, as if preparing for a downward flight to the earth, in contrast to the prairie hen (fig. 4), which, beyond doubt, aims to rise. The double eagle has but one body and one pair of wings; the tail, however, is quite broad and shows a slightly marked division. In neither of the two figures are the legs plainly shown, as the former are attached to the fife by a rudely formed connection of clay. The double figure has a sharply curved eagle-like beak. The entire shape of the head reminds one of the ancient Mexican representations of the whiteheaded eagle in Central and South America. Our collection possesses several of these figures in clay. It is therefore very probable that the pre-Columbian Mexicans connected a certain significance with a double eagle, which also became an important symbol of power with many civilized nations.

with a tapering stem or neck, which served as a mouthpiece. It is modeled in gray-colored clay and unpainted, with the exception of the mouthpiece, which is colored dark red, and highly polished. The front portion of the instrument is ornamented in relief, and on the opposite side is a raised loop, forming a suspension hole. It has one sound hole near the base of the air chamber, and two notes are possible:

The air passage is through the neck and the venthole is represented in the widely open mouth.

material and from the same locality as the preceding. The ornamentation, however, is different. Attached to the upper part of the tube about midway from each end is a disk ornamented in relief. Back of this are two projecting wings, and a sort of tail curves over the end of the tube, but leaving the bore entirely open. There are no finger holes, and the whistling apparatus is so much damaged that no musical sound can be produced.
Tubular instruments with four finger holes and but little, if any, added decorations are represented in the National Museum by three specimens found by Mr. Edward Palmer while exploring a cave situated in the Hortices district about 28 miles east of Colima, Mexico. All are modeled in rather coarse reddish clay. The largest (fig. 250a) measures 134 uches in length by ? inch in outside diameter, the bore or inside being <8; inch. The mouthpiece is formed by closing and flattening one er of the tube, and has the usual air passage and venthole. The finger holes are a little less than 4 inch in diameter, and are placed $ inch apart, the lower one being 1 inch from the end of the tube. This instrument is well preserved, but for some reason the tones emitted are weak, and can only be produced by blowing softly. Thenotesareas follows:

These are obtained by using. ordinary force in blowing. Inereased power will produce their octave, and, with added force, the fifth above is possible.
With the two instruments just described Mr. Palmer found a double flute or flageolet (fig. 250)). The tubes seem to have been made separately and then luted together. At the lower end of each are four finger holes of the same size and distance apart as given in fig. 250a.

<<<Page: 801>>>

The mouthpiece is broken off and missing, and whether the sounds produced were in unison or not it is impossible to determine.
The instrument represented by fig. 251 is more like the modern flageolet in shape than any in the series. The lower part is missing, but its probable outline is indicated in the sketch by the dotted lines. It is modeled of gray-colored clay, highly polished, and has band decorations in red. The long, slender mouthpiece and upper part of the cylinder containing two finger holes is all that remains. Entire, it probably had four holes, the usual number in instruments of this shape. The notes that can be produced now are as follows:
This, of course, hardly gives an idea of the pitch and compass of the instrument originally. Specimen, Cat. No. 133212 (U.S.N.M.) evidently belongs to this class— nothing remaining, however, but the mouthpiece and enough of the cylinder to produce one note, thus:

The bell mouth is ornamented on the outer surface (fig. 1). The ornaments are apparently done by hand. They make a neat finish, which shows a taste for regular ornamentation and an advanced technique in the working of the, in itself, somewhat ungrateful material. The ornamentation of the bell mouth is often very rich and elegant.
‘Adolf Bastian, Festschrift zum 26 Juni, 1896, pp. 560,561. See p. 596.

<<<Page: 802>>>

The bell mouths were painted with a white color, which now remains for the most part only in the deeper parts, but formerly probably covered the entire ornament. All the bell mouths with which I am acquainted are somewhat ornamented. In the flutes of reddish clay, the mouthpiece, almost to the wind hole, is often an intense red, and in color reminds one somewhat of terra sigillata. Neither the red nor the black color, however, is to be attributed to glazing, but to a coloring matter which was burned in.
A description of the twenty-four flutes or fragments of flutes would be superfluous in this place. They all resemble one another in a high degree. The number of the finger holes, the form of the wind hole and of the mouthpiece, is alike in all. They differ only in the color (red and black); in height, which varies from 174 to 254 centimeters; in the decoration of the bell mouth; and in the number of the color rings, which sometimes encircle the tubes near the finger holes,
All the flutes which have hitherto been made known from Old Mexico are not alike in form, according to letters of Mr, Seler; the flutes mentioned in the manuscript of the Biblioteca Laurenziana are formed more like oboes, so far as the mouthpiece is concerned. It is bent at an obtuse angle. These flutes have also four finger holes, but no bell mouth. The tube is rather cut diagonally at the end. For an ornament

there is a neat red patch on the tube above the finger holes, while the color of the flute appears bright yellow. From the color it is to be assumed that the flutes pictured in the Sahagun manuscript were made of reed. The red mass is doubtless the loop of riband or a small leather strap.
In the collection of Gabriel Mas, in Munich, there isa flute which has a divine figure on the front, probably Xipe the ‘‘ Geschundenen.”
He adds in a footnote (2, p. 559):
It is not correct to designate this instrument as a flute; flageolet would be better. A flute oceurs in Europe under this name, and which is made on the same principle. But I will not quibble about the name flute, because it already occurs in literature.
We are indebted to Mr. A. E. Douglas, of New York, for the loan of a flageolet (entire) from the valley of Mexico.! Its shape is practically the same as outlined in fig. 251. A short description and its musical capacity are here given.
''This specimen was purchased by Mr. Douglas from the Boban collection of Mexican antiquities sold in New York City, December, 1886, called in the catalogue (No. 14) Uilacapitzli, and from the valley of Mexico.

number of instruments of this class. They are of the finely polished red and black ware and have four finger holes. All are more or less broken.
In the American Museum of Natural History at Central Park, New York, I saw one of these instruments with the bell mouth and decorations. similar to fig. 251 just described, and also to specimens in the South Kensington Museum figured and described by Carl Engel.!
But there were two others, in fragments, which, instead of ending in a bell-shaped mouth, terminated in a man’s head, face or mask of the usual Mexican type. The face looked directly in front and was only slightly larger in diameter than the tube. The instrument itself was nearly a cylinder with no variations in diameter. The forehead and sides of the face were firmly attached to and formed part of the tube. The orifice or venthole for the expulsion of air is placed under the chin and corresponds to the throat.
Fig. 252 represents an instrument somewhat like those just described. It was lately presented to the Museum by Mr. Newton H. Chittenden, and is said to have been found in ancient Aztec ruins in Mexico. It is made of grayish-colored clay and painted black. The workmanship is rather rude and the clay not so well tempered as in some of the specimens before mentioned. The upper part is in the form of a grotesque. human head with the tongue protruding. The headdress is quite elaborate and contains the whistling apparatus. There are two projections, one on each side of the hollow tube, which are ornamented with incised lines. The expanding bell-shaped end is decorated in relief, and with incised lines and dots. There are four finger holes, but so much of the mouthpiece is missing that its former musical capacity can not be ascertained.
The collection of Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, of New York, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Central Park, contains a number of instruments similar to the foregoing. They are figured in an interesting work entitled Musical Instruments and their Homes.’ Referring to these instruments the author says in part:
We must distinguish three different classes. The first consists of those which have been introduced by the European invaders, the second consists of the instruments of native origin now in actual use, the third class are those which have been preserved in the various mounds and pyramids of the Aztecs.
To the latter class the instruments here described undoubtedly belong.
An instrument presented by Mrs. J. Crosby Brown is shown in fig. 253. It is in the form of a reptile highly conventionalized. The body is a cylindrical tube, with the open end projecting below the neck of the reptile. At the opposite extremity the tube is enlarged somewhat to accommodate the whistling mechanism, and a tapering continuation forms the tail, which serves as a mouthpiece. There are four finger holes on the upper part or back. The lowest tone is obtained with all

Fig. 254 represents an instrument carved in marble. The upper end is broken, but was evidently fashioned for the insertion of a mouthpiece similar to the modern flageolet, a portion of the vent hole still remaining. It has six sound holes, and the lower end is carved in imitation of an alligator’s head. A hastily constructed mouthpiece of wood (see restoration) was inserted by the writer, and a rather imperfect scale obtained. ‘The antiquity of this instrument may not be very great. The fact of its having six finger holes suggests Kuropean contact, as in all other specimens of this class from the Western Hemisphere the usual number appears to have been four holes.
Prehistoric musical instruments made of wood are extremely rare. A material which decays so easily can not resist the influences of time, except under favorable conditions which retard its destruction. The wooden objects in the National Museum classed as prehistoric were all obtained from burial places, either in caves or graves.
Fig. 255 represents a whistle made from a hollow reed or cane. It was found in a prehistoric cavern near the Bay of Angeles, Lower California. One end is closed with resin and forms an air chamber. About 3 inches from
the open end, which served as a mouthpiece, is a joint or knot in the

reed. At this point the tube is scooped out, leaving the natural barrier or division exposed. This formed a stop, which deflected the current of air (when blown into the open end) in the same manner as does the transverse ridge of asphaltum in the bone whistles from California heretofore described (p. 567), The outer surface is ornamented with incised bands and dots, which appear to have been burntin. The specimen is so much weathered that no definite sound is emitted. A smaller whistle from the same cavern differs only in having both ends open. The lateral hole is at the joint, as in the foregoing. These instruments are a part of a collection obtained by Mr. Edward Palmer, who made the exploration in 1887.!
A flageolet, obtained from the Yaqui Indians of Sonora, Mexico, is shown in fig. 256. Itis made of cane, strengthened with bands of sinew. There are three sound holes, two on the upper surface near the lower end, and one below (which does not show in the drawing), placed between the third and fourth bands from the lower end. Length, 213 inches. A wooden plug cut away on one side so as to leave an air passage was inserted at the upper end and formed the mouthpiece.

During the progress of this paper, Mr. Wilson, profiting by his attendance as Commissioner General of the United States at the Brussels International Exposition, 1897, visited the extensive Musée Instrumental of the Conservatory of Music of Brussels. Its curator, M. Mahillon, himself a musical-instrument maker, having devoted much time, labor and money to its successful accomplishment, has united the musical instruments of all nations. He has prepared an analytic and descriptive catalogue of the instruments under his charge, which greatly increases the value of the collection. The policy of the Belgian Government has been to invoke for the benefit of the Museum the aid of its foreign representatives in the procuration of local instruments, whether primitive or modern. As a result, it has been, through the good offices of M. Dorenberg, Belgian consul at Puebla, Mexico, the fortunate recipient of a collection of Mexican instruments, all of which are primitive, but quite a number prehistoric, These include the Toponaztli (Spanish Atabal) or drum, the Marimba, and the Chirimia (a sort of hautboy), and are said to be used together forming a primitive band. Along with these is a series, twenty-five, more or less, of whistles or flageolets similar to those heretofore represented. They figure in the Museum catalogue as Nos, 819-821, 832-856, inclusive. Most of them are apparently without holes and give but a single note which is remark-

Whistles or flageolets.—There are
in the Museum a number of pot-
tery whistles or flageolets from various localities in Nicaragua, collected
by Dr. J. F. Bransford and Dr. Earl Flint, of the United States Navy, and also others lately received from the Nicaraguan Government. The latter are part of the Government collection exhibited at the Columbian Historical Exposition held at Madrid in 1892.
Fig. 259 represents a grotesque bird-shaped whistle of black ware from Ometepe Island, Lake Nicaragua. It is part of a collection made by Dr. J. F. Bransford in Nicaragua and deseribed by him in “Archieological Researches in Nicaragua.”! There are two finger holes in the back and. the head serves as a mouthpiece. A raised fillet forms three notes are as follows:

Musical instruments of percussion are wanting in the museum collection of prehistoric objects from Costa Rica, neither drums or rattles being represented. There is no reason to suppose, however, that none existed. Their immediate neighbors to the south (Chiriqui) have furnished numerous examples of both drum and rattle. Mr. W. H. Holmes, in speaking of the ancient art of Chiriqui,' says:
So far as the art of pottery has come within my observation, it appears to indicate
a somewhat closer relationship with the ancient Costa Rican peoples than with those of continental South America.

intended, perhaps, to facilitate the lashing or cementing on of the head. Two raised bands, intended to imitate twisted cords, encircle the most constricted part of the body, a single band similarly marked encircling the base.

The following is copied from Mr. MeNiel’s label attached to the drum:
Grave at Moritana del Bufo, Divala. This and 14 canteros, 1 stool, 5 stone hatchets, 3 ‘spiners,” and human bones, seem to have been the outfit of a musician.
Mr. Holmes continues (p. 159, fig. 237):
The decorated specimen illustrated in fig. 237 is imperfect, a few inches of the base having been lost. The shape is rather more elegant than that of the other specimen, and the surface is neatly finished and polished. The ground color, or slip, is a warm yellow gray, and the decoration is in red and black. The rim, or upper margin, is rather rudely finished and is painted red, and on the exterior is made slightly concave and furnished with a raised band to facilitate the attachment of the head.
Rattles.—The instruments of this class from Chiriqui are gourd-shaped, and the majority are painted and decorated in the same manner as the whistles and other pottery objects from that

Bronze bells.—The descriptions and illustrations here given of metallic objects are mostly taken from Mr. Holmes’s paper.!
Bells seem to have been in pretty general use by the more cultured American races previous to the conquest. The form best known is the hawk bell, or common sleigh bell of the North. The globular body is suspended by a loop at the top and is slit on the under side, so that the tinkling of the small free pellets of metal may be andible. Such bells are found in considerable numbers in the graves of Chiriqui, although I have no positive assurance that any of the examples in mny possession were actually taken from

The human figure was occasionally utilized. The treatment, however, is extremely rude and conventional, the features having the peculiar squirrel-like character shown in the figurines already given. The unique piece given in fig. 256 represents a short, clumsy female figure with a squirrel face, carrying a vessel upon her back by means of a head strap, which is held in place by the hands.

They will be found to occur nearer the lower than the upper limit of their ranges. It should be observed that the capacity for variation possessed by each of these notes enables the skilled performer to glide from one to the other without interruption. This instrument is, therefore, within its limited range as capable of adjusting itself to any succession of intervals as is the trombone or the violin. I do not imagine, however, that the aboriginal performer made any systematic use of this power or that the instrument was purposely so constructed. It will be seen by reference to the scale that stopping the orifice in the end opposite the mouthpiece changes the notes half a tone, or perhaps, if accurately measured, a little less than that.
Specimen, Cat. No. 132754 (U.S.N.M.) is a smaller whistle, somewhat like the preceding in outline. The lower projection opposite the mouthpiece is, however, closed, and there are but two sound holes. The following notes are emitted: oat

Specimen, Cat. No. 195590 (U.S.N.M.) represents an animal-shaped whistle from La Plata Island, Ecuador. It is rudely modeled in coarse gray-colored clay. The whistling device is placed at the back of the neck, where the hollow interior is divided by a thin partition. In this
arrangement the head serves as an air chamber and the body a mouthpiece. Its one note, F'#, is here given:
Rattles, flutes, and trumpets.—The musical instruments in the Museum obtained from British Guiana can not properly be classed as prehistoric. It was thought, however, that descriptions of a few primitive instruments belonging to still existing tribes might prove interesting. It appears that only a limited variety of instruments are known to these people. Rattles and whistles or flutes made of different material seem

<<<Page: 847>>>

to have been all that can be so classed. Fig. 308, collected by W. C. McClintock, represents a rattle (shak-shak), made of thin strips of cane
plaited as in making baskets. At the lower end the strips are drawn together and lashed around a small spindle of wood with a cord of grass fiber, which forms the handle. The strips are of two colors, alternating as they are woven. The inside is furnished with small pebbles or seeds, which produce the rattling sound. This sound, however, is quite feeble, owing to the nature of the material which forms the chamber. A similar instrument in the Haldeman collection, Museum of Academy Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, is labeled as from the Carib Indians, British Guiana.
Specimen, Cat. No. 5374 (U.S.N.M.), presented by J. Varden, is a rattle made of around gourd. It is painted dark brown and has four narrow slits or incisions about 4 inches long—two vertical and two horizontal— on opposite sides. A number of small pebbles inside produce the sound when shaken. A piece of wood 294 inches long passes through the gourd and extends 15 inches beyond the upper part. The lower end or handle proper projects 113 inches. The upper end is wrapped with a piece of flat sinnet made of cotton cord, to loops in which are attached bright-colored feathers of the parrakeet. An instrument from British Guiana identical with the foregoing is figured and described by Mr. J. G. Wood.!

difference in outline, as will be seen by referring to the sketch. Carl Engel mentions instruments of pottery somewhat like those just described, but of larger dimensions. Speaking of these,’ he says:
The botuto, which Gumilla saw used by some tribes near the Orinoco (of which we engrave two examples) was evidently an ancient Indian contrivance, but appears to have fallen almost into oblivion during the last two centuries. It was made of baked clay and was commonly from 3 to 4 feet long; but some trumpets of this kind were of enormous size. The botuto with two bellies was usually made thicker than that with three bellies and emitted a deeper sound, which is described as having been really terrific. These trumpets were used on occasions of mourning and funeral dances. Alexander von Humboldt saw the botuto among some Indian tribes near the River Orinoco.
The small instruments just described may be a survival of the ancient:

Dual bone flutes with finger holes are yet in use in the northern provinces, besides bamboo flutes and instruments with which the voices of wild beasts are imitated with singular accuracy.!
Whistling bottles.—There are in the Museum a number of pottery bottles, obtained from ancient burial places in Peru, which are capable of emitting musical sounds. Many of these vessels are double, with an interior connection at point of contact, and those which are not double have two projections, one being the neck or mouth proper and the other terminating in the figure of a bird or animal which contains the whistling apparatus. The human form is also represented. It has been said that when pouring the water out, a sound imitating the note or ery of the bird or animal represented is produced.’
In experimenting with the bottles or instruments about to be described, the author has not been able to obtain any sound by pouring the water out. If the vessels are submerged in water, leaving the whistle above, their sounds or notes are given while the air is forced out by the incoming water. The clearest tone, however, is emitted by blowing, and the notes indicated in the accompanying scales were obtained in that way, using the open neck as a mouthpiece. The descriptions of these vessels by some writers (Bollert and von Tschudi) hardly give due credit to the aboriginal potter. The mechanism by which the sound or note is produced is something more than a hole or opening through which the air is forced, for it is constructed on the principle of the flageolet, as are the instruments from Mexico and Central America previously described. On some of these vessels two notes can be produced, varying from a semitone to a major third above the lowest tone (fig. 314). In all cases the upper note is made by using more force in blowing. In the specimens which are indicated as emitting but one tone, no amount of manipulation will give anything else, as more or less force in blowing causes the tone to break. <As a result of these trials, I am inclined to believe that the objects here described were intended to serve a double purpose—as water bottles and also as whistles.

the South American Indians, evidently refers to this class. His description is here given:
Several of these barbarous contrivances scarcely deserve to be classed with musical instruments. ‘This may, for instance, be said of certain musical jars or earthen vessels producing sounds, which the Peruvians constructed for their amusement, These vessels were made double, and the sounds imitated the cries of animals or birds. A similar contrivance of the Indians in Chile, preserved in the museum at Santiago, is described by the traveler 8. 8. Hill as follows: ‘It consists of two earthen vessels in the form of our india-rubber bottles, but somewhat larger, with a flat tube from 4 to 6 inches in length uniting their necks near the the top and slightly curved upward, and with a small hole on the upper side one-third the length of the tube from one side of the necks. To produce the sounds the bottles were filled with water and suspended to the bough of a tree, or to a beam, by a string attached to the middle of the curved tube, and then swung backward and forward in such a manner as to cause each end to be alternately the highest and lowest, so that the water might pass backward and forward from one bottle to the other through the tube between them. By this means soothing sounds were produced which, it is said, were employed to lull to repose the drowsy chiefs who usually slept away the hottest hours of the day. In the meantime, as the bottles were porous, the water within them diminished by evaporation, and the sound died gradually away.”
The remarks in the quotation regarding the production of sound, i. e., by partially filling the bottles with water and

vessels in the museum collection. This has been demonstrated by experiment. The musical notation of these instruments ( ?) has, however, as before stated, been obtained by blowing in the open neck. Perhaps, as Engel says, they “scarcely deserve to be classed with musical instruments.”

Bird-shaped whistles.—Fig. 321 represents the only example in the United States National Museum from Peru of a bird-shaped whistle identical in all respects with the Mexican and Central American instruments. It was presented by Col. J.S. Billings, surgeon, United States Army, and forms part of a series of objects obtained by him from an ancient grave in the mountains near Lima. It is of reddish clay, slightly polished. The painted decoration is quite simple, the wings only being outlined in black. There are two sound holes, one on each side, near the middle of the body. .

Bone flute—An interesting object of bone from the same grave is
represented in fig. 322. It is part of the ulna of the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus molinew). The ends of the bone have been cut off and the

cellular portion removed. In its original condition this instrument was probably furnished with four finger holes, as were some of the whistles or flutes from the California islands previously mentioned (p. 570, fig. 210), and to which it bears a remarkable resemblance. This one is unfortunately broken off at the third hole. Wiener,! speaking of this class of instruments, says:
The most curious objects of this kind are, without contradiction, the flutes of the tibia or other bones of birds, many times covered with designs (incised).
Syrinx or Panpipes (reed and stone) —Two interesting specimens made of hollow reeds, representing the syrinx or Pan-pipes (huayra-puhura) are preserved in the National Museum. They were obtained by Ensign W. E. Safford, “United States Navy, from ancient burial

by the Peruvians before the Spanish conquest is shown by the historian Garcilasso de la Vega.' Of their music he says:
In music they arrived to a certain harmony, in which the Indians of Colla did more particularly excel, having been the inventors of a certain pipe made of canes glued together, every one of which having a different note of higher and lower, in the manner of organs, made a pleasing music by the dissonancy of sounds, the treble, tenor, and bass, exactly corresponding and answering to each other; with these pipes they often played in concert, and made tolerable music, though they wanted the quayers, semiquavers, airs, and many voices which perfect the harmony among us. They had, also, other pipes which were flutes, with four or five stops, like the pipes of shepherds.
Rivero and Von Tschudi? mention similar instruments made of reeds of cane or stone and adorned sometimes with needlework.
Fig. 325 represents an instrument made of stone. It is reproduced from Engel’s drawing,’ and his description here follows:
Another huyara-puhura, likewise still yielding sounds, was discovered placed over a corpse in a Peruvian tomb, and wasprocured by the French general, Paroissien. This instrument is made of a greenish stone, which is a species of tale, and contains eight pipes. In the Berlin Museum may be seen a good plaster cast taken from this curious relic. The height is 52 inches, and its width 64 inches. Four of the tubes have small lateral finger-holes, which, when closed, lower the pitch a semitone. These holes are on the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh pipes, as shown in the engraving. When the holes are open, the tones are:

The musician is likely to speculate what could have induced the Peruvians to adopt so strange a series of intervals; it seems rather arbitrary than meditated.

<<<Page: 861>>>

Certain differences of opinion exist among historians of music as to the scale adopted by primitive peoples in their earliest efforts. One class thinks it finds in the laws of sound a relationship between notes of different pitch, which harmonize with each other and make a concord of sweet sounds, and demonstrates a scale natural to all men and therefore universal, applying as well to the savage as to the enlightened; that is to say, they believe that when the savage has become sufficiently practiced in music to employ a scale of any kind, he will use that belonging to modern and civilized music because that scale is natural to man. Other persons deny this, and express their belief that primitive peoples either did not recognize this concord, or else did not desire it.
These differences of opinion have not been adjusted. When one party shows primitive instruments on which the modern scale can be produced, or shows primitive music written on the modern staff, they are met with the assertion that this is, or may be, the result of straining the instrument to produce the given note.
Neither myself nor my associate, Mr. Upham, have taken sides in this controversy, recognizing our role to be that of gathering facts rather than indulging in speculation, that our facts may be used by both parties, thus serving in some degree to elucidate these disputed questions.
Great care has been employed in ascertaining the tones or pitch indicated in the staves, that they should represent the normal scale of each instrument. They could be manipulated so as to give a tone higher or lower than normal. Particular pains have been taken to represent upon the staff the notes obtained, by using average force in blowing, and to avoid the temptation to raise or lower the pitch, in order that the intervals might be more easily represented on the staff or more satisfying to the ear.
The fact that it is rare to find two instruments from a given locality which produce the same tones indicates at least that their construction (musically) was not based on any established or recognized scale. With most of them the intervals and scale appear to have been purely accidental. What results might be obtained if all prehistoric instruments could be brought together and studied it is impossible to say.

The following work has grown from a simple catalogue into its present proportions in an endeavor to illustrate the distribution of certain games, and by comparison elucidate their original significance. In the American part an attempt has been made to describe as far as possible the implements for games of the types mentioned, in American museums. Additions and corrections, to be incorporated in a subsequent publication, will be gratefully acknowledged by the author.

By STEWART CULIN,
Director of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, University of Pennsylvania.
The object of this collection' is to illustrate the probable origin, significance, and development of the games of chess and playing-cards. Following up the suggestion made to the writer by Mr. Frank H. Cushing, they are both regarded as derived from the divinatory use of the arrow, and as representing the two principal methods of arrowdivination. Incidental to the main subject, various games and divinatory processes having a like origin, although not leading directly to chess or cards, are exhibited, as well as specimens of each class from various countries.
The basis of the divinatory systems from which games have arisen is assumed to be the classification of all things according to the Four Directions.2. This method of classification is practically universal
'This collection, for which a diploma of honor and gold medal were awarded at the Atlanta Exposition, was subsequently placed on exhibition in the U.S. National Museum, where it has since been augmented by many of the additional games described in this catalogue.—EDITOR.
‘Some idea of the extent to which the classification of things according to the world quarters was carried in Kastern Asia may be obtained from the numerical categories in the second part of Mayer’s Chinese Reader’s Manual, from which the following examples are taken:
DIRECTIONS. SEASONS. COLORS. ELEMENTS. PLANETS. METALS. GRAINS. North. Winter. Black. Water. Mercury. Tron. Pulse. East. Spring. Green. Wood. Jupiter. Lead, tin. Corn. South. Summer. Red. Fire. Mars. Copper. Millet. West. Autumn. White. Metal. Venus. Silver. Hemp. Middle. Yellow. Earth. Saturn. Gold. Rice.
I append, for purpose of comparison, a list of some of the corresponding categories as they exist in the pueblo of Zuni, New Mexico, kindly furnished me by Mr. Cushing.
DIRECTIONS. SEASONS. COLORS. ELEMENTS. North. Winter. Yellow. Air (wind or breath). West. Spring. Blue. Water. South. Summer. Red. Fire. East. Autumn. White. Earth (seeds of). Upper. Day. Many-color. Waking or life condition. Lower. Night. Black. Sleeping or death condition. Middle. Year. All colors. All elements and conditions.
It should be observed that the connotations of color and direction vary from the above and from each other among the different American tribes, between Aztee and Maya, and between the different Mexican chroniclers.

among primitive peoples both in Asia and America. In order to classify objects and events which did not in themselves reveal their proper assignment resort was had to magic. Survivals of these magical processes constitute our present games. The identity of the games of Asia and America may be explained upon the ground of their common object and the identity of the mythic concepts which underlie them.

These concepts, as illustrated in games, appear to be well nigh universal. In the classification of things according to the Four Quarters we find that a numerical ratio was assumed to exist between the several categories. The discovery of this ratio was regarded as an all-important clue. The cubical dotted die represents one of the implements of magic employed for this purpose. The cubical die belongs, howevei,

to a comparatively late period in the history of games and divination. The almost universal object for determining number, and thence by counting, place or direction, is three or more wooden staves, usually flat on one side and rounded upon the other. Numerical counts are attributed to their several falls. A typical game in which these staves are employed is found in No, |—the Korean game of Nyout.

(b) Reproduction of native picture; Korean boys playing Nyout.!
The national game of Korea. Two, three, or four persons play, moving objects used as men around a circuit, according to throws made with four blocks of wood used as dice. The circuit (fig. 1) is marked with twenty-nine points, twenty of which are arranged equally distant in a circle, within which is a cross composed of nine stations. The blocks ordinarily used are called pam-nyout or “chestnut nyout” (Plate 1, fig. 1), white and flat on one side and black and convex on the other. The pieces or men, called mai (Chinese, md), “horses,” may consist of any convenient stick or stone. The throws count as follows:
4 white sides up, nyout, =4 4 black sides up, mo, 3 white sides up, kel, 2 white sides up, kai, 1 white side up, to
dl mi bo oD
A throw of nyout or mo entitles the player to another throw, which he makes before moving his piece. The one who shall play first is determined by throwing the blocks, the highest leading. The players enter their men on the mark next on the left of the large circle at the top of the diagram, and move around against the sun. The object of the game is to get from one to four horses around the circuit and out again at the top. If a player throws so that one of his men falls upon another of his own he may double up the two pieces and thereafter take them around as one piece, they counting as two in the game. If a player’s piece falls upon an opponent’s the latter is said to be “caught,” and is sent back to the beginning, and must be started again as at first. The captor is given another throw. Partners are permitted to move each other’s pieces. In opening the game, if a player’s man falls upon the large circle B, on the left, he returns to the goal by the radii b HE, HE A. If he overthrows the mark B he must continue on to C. At this point he returns by the diameter C A, but if he overthrows C he must continue on to D and around the circuit to A, the going-out place.
ters, reading as four lines of a verse, inscribed in the circles. Children frequently play upon a circuit drawn upon the ground. In the picture of the game (Plate 2) the boys are represented as throwing the blocks through a cuff, which one of them has removed for the purpose. This is done to render the result of the throws more a matter of chance than of skill, and is a substitute for a ring of straw, about 2 inches in diameter, affixed to the end of a stick about a foot long, which is stuck in the center of the ring for the same purpose. The selection of the wood for the sticks is not a matter of individual caprice. They are usually made of the wood of a thick bushy tree, like the prunus, called ssa-ri, used in China for bows, whence the game is called sa-ri-nyout. Another wood, pak-tal-na-mou, defined as a very hard wood of which mallets are made, is sometimes used, but the former is preferred.
‘Stewart Culin, Korean Games, Philadelphia, 1895.
2The term md, or horses, applied to men or pieces in a game, is of high antiquity in China, and was also given to the counters employed in the classical Chinese game of T’aw vi or ‘“‘pitch pot” (pitching arrows or arrow-lots into a pot), described in the Li Ki.

A reproduction of the first section, entitled Tjyek-sd-tjyem (Chinese, chdk sz’ chim) “Throwing Nyout Divination,” from a little Korean handbook, Tjik-syeng-pep (Chinese, chik sing fat) Correct Planet Rule” is given in fig. 3. The numbers represented by the throws are from ‘‘one” to *‘ four” in sixty-four permutations, from which it will be seen that only three staves are used. Nyout or “four” is the highest throw, and an explanation is thus given of the name of the game.

The Chinese Book of Divination consists of sixty-four diagrams, kwd, composed of combinations of unbroken — with broken lines , Six being taken at a time, and the resulting diagrams being known as the sixty-four kwd (fig. 4). Hach of these diagrams is designated by a name and accompanied by a short explanatory text. Now the sixty-four hexagrams are regarded as an expansion of the eight trigrams (fig. 5), called the pdt kwd or eight kwd, formed by combining the Same unbroken and broken lines, three at a time. The unbroken lines in the diagram are called yéwng, “masculine,” and the broken lines yam, ‘‘feminine.” It is apparent that if the two sides of the Ko-

<<<Page: 888>>>

rean blocks be regarded as representing the unbroken or masculine lines and the broken or feminine lines the trigrams will form a record of the throws when three blocks are used, and the hexagrams when six blocks are taken. From this I regard the divinatory use of the nyout blocks in connection with the handbook as illustrating the origin of the Chinese Book of Divination, to which the handbook presents an almost perfect parallel.! As it appears from the foreign names of the stave-throws in Korea that the system is foreign and non-Chinese, confirmation is afforded of the theory of the foreign origin of the Book of Divination advanced by Professor
Terrien de Lacouperie. A detailed acSouth count of nyout is given by the writer in wy —— V* p,

ACCORDING TO FUH-HI, The assumption that the nyout staves eet were derived from arrows, suggested by rors Mayer's Chinese Render etandicol
Mr. Cushing, is based upon evidence furnished by corresponding American games; for example, in the Kiowa game of Zohn ahl, No. 3, where three of the staves bear marks like arrow feathering. In throwing the long nyoué staves it is customary to hold three crosswise over the other (Plate 1, fig. 3), in somewhat the same manner as in the Zuni game of Shd-li-we. (Compare fig. 112.) 2. GAMING ARROWS.’ Kiowa Indians. Indian Territory, United States.
'T am informed that in the system of fortune-telling known in Japan as yeki (No. 65), in which splints are ordinarily used, three small blocks are sometimes tossed to determine the diagrams. In this method, known as Arai shin yeki, from Arai, the name of the reputed inventor, three rectangular blocks, called sangi, about 3 inches in length, made of some hard wood—cherry, or, preferably, ebony—are employed. Two of the opposite long sides are plain. The two other opposite faces are marked with vermilion ink in Chinese characters: On one, Tin, ‘‘Heaven;” one, 7%, “Barth,” and the other Yan, ‘‘Man.” ‘The determinations are made according to the positions in which the marked sides fall one to another, which are referred to a special treatise. Another similar method employed in Japan, also attributed to Arai, is by means of three ancient ‘‘cash” or coins, which are tossed from a tortoise shell. My informant, Mr. K. Wadamori, of Tokio, himself a yeki gakusha or ‘‘yeki scholar,” tells me that dots are frequently employed in Japan in noting the diagrams, as in the Malagassy sikiddy.

It is probable that these arrows were actually used in a game extremely common among the Plains Indians. It consists in the players tossing arrows in turn at a mark. The object of each player after the first is to throw his arrow so that it will lie across the arrow or arrows

that have been tossed before.! Mr. Cushing informs me that the counts usually depend upon whether the tossed arrow falls upon the other at its head, middle, or foreshaft.
'Mr. E..W. Davis — given me an account of this game, as seen by him played by the Apache of Geronimo’s band in 1889, in St. Augustine, Florida. He states that the mark was about 10 feet away. ‘The arrows were tossed point first. The first man to throw was required to landon the mark. If he did so he got his arrow back. Once an arrow in the field, the object of the next player was to toss his arrow so that it should cross the first thrown, and so on through the crowd. I have seen as many as six play, and often all would toss around without anyone winning. In this case the arrows on the ground remained in the pot, so to speak. The play then went on, each player winning as many arrows as he could succeed in crossing with his own, until the whole number was removed.”

The incised designs, painted red, yellow, green, and blue, are in part easily recognizable as the calumet with primer, bow and arrow, the lightning, and the symbols of the Four Directions on the uppermost arrow (Plate 3), which are painted from left to right with the colors red, green, blue, and yellow.

3. ZOHN AHL,' commonly known as the “Awl Game.” Kiowa Indians, Indian Territory, United States.
(a) A cloth, called the “awl cloth.”
(b) Two awls.
(c) Flat bowlder, called the ‘“ awl stone.”
(d) Four prepared staves, called ahl or ‘ wood.” (e) Hight other sticks, to be used as counters.’
The ‘awl cloth” (fig. 6) is divided into points by which the game is counted. The curved lines upon it are called ‘ knees,” because they are like the knees of the players.
The space between the parallel lines 1 and 1 and 20 and 20 is called ‘the creek,” and the corresponding spaces between the parallel lines at right angles are called the “dry branches.”
Three of the “‘ahl sticks” (fig. 7) have a red stripe running down the middle and one has a blue stripe. They are held by the player in one hand and struck downward, so that their ends come on the “ahl stone” with considerable force. If all the sticks fall with the sides without grooves uppermost, the play is called ‘+ white,” and counts ten. If all the grooved sides come uppermost, it is called ‘ red,” and counts five. Both of these throws entitle the player to another throw. If one grooved side is uppermost, it counts one; two grooved sides, two, and three grooved sides, three. The game is played by any even number

of girls or women (never by men or boys), half on one side the line NS and half on the other. The flat ail stone is placed in the middle of the cloth, and the players kneel on the edge. The two awls are stuck in the creek at 11. The player at A makes the first throw, and the throwing goes around the circle in the direction of the hands of a watch, each side counting the results of each throw on the ‘‘awl cloth” by sticking its awl just beyond the mark called for by the results of the throw. The moves are made in opposite directions, as indicated by the arrows. :
If in counting any awl gets into the ‘“‘creek” at N, that side must forfeit a counter to the other side and be set back to the “creek” at S. That side is then said to have fallen into the “creek,” the object being to “jump over.” If in their passage around the circle the two “‘awls” get in the same division, the last comer is said to whip or kill the former, who forfeits a counter, and is set back to the beginning. The counting continues until one gets back to the “creek” at S. The one first at S receives a counter, and if there is more than enough to take it to the “creek,” the surplus is added to the next round; that is, the “creek” is jumped, and the “awl” put beyond it as many points as may be over. When one side wins all the counters, it conquers. If the game should be broken up before this event, the side which has the greater number of counters is the victor.!
See account of game by Mr. James Mooney on page 731.
This game was selected for exhibition from many similar games played by different tribes in America as readily illustrating the probable derivation of the four staves. Three of them will be seen to appear to be marked on one face with the feathered shaftment of an arrow, while the fourth probably represents the atlatl or “ throwing stick.”
In the following pages & description is given of implements for American games of the preceding type contained in various museums of the United States, together with accounts of the methods of play, arranged alphabetically under linguistic families and tribes. For the purpose of comparison all games in which objects are tossed to determine number are included. Their relations one to another, whatever they may be, will doubtless become apparent through this and subsequent collections.
‘Lieutenant Scott further states that the Kiowa have a custom of wetting the fingers and slapping them several times on the stone before a throw, and calling out ‘red, red,” or ‘“white, white,” according to the number they desire to count; or, if but “one” should be required to throw the opposite party into the ‘ creek,” someone puts her finger into her mouth, and, drawing it carefully across the top of the stone, calls out parko, parko (‘‘one, one”). Often before the throw the thrower will rub the four sticks in a vertical position backward and forward several times between the palms of the hands, to insure good luck.
“The Comanche have a similar game which they play with eight ahl sticks, and the
Cheyenne and Arapaho are said to have a game which they play with ahl sticks, which are 2 feet or more long.” (H.L.S.)

<<<Page: 895>>>

The following account of the game is given by the collector:!
The dice game is called ta-v sétd tina (literally, ‘‘striking” or ‘throwing against” something) Dy the Arapaho, and Ménshiminh by the Cheyenne, the same name being now given to the modern card games. It was practically universal among all the tribes east and west, and, under the name of hubbub, is described by a New England writer? as far back as 1634 almost precisely as it exists to-day among the prairie tribes. The only difference seems to have been that in the east it was played also by the men, and to the accompaniment of a song, such as is used in the hand games of the Western tribes. The requisites are a small wicker bowl or basket (hat é chi na), five dice made of bone or plum stones, and a pile of tally sticks, such as are used in the awl game. The bowl] is6or8 inches in diameter and about 2 inches deep, and is woven in basket fashion of the tough fibers of the yucca. The dice may be round, elliptical, or diamond-shaped, and are variously marked on one side with lines or figures, the turtle being a favorite design among the Arapaho. Two of the five must be alike in shape and marking. The other three are marked with another design and may also be of another shape. Any number of women and girls may play, each throwing in turn, and sometimes one set of partners playing against another. The partners toss up the dice from the basket, letting them drop again into it, and score points according to the way the dice turn up in the basket. The first throw by each player is made from the hand instead of from the basket. One hundred points usually count a game, and stakes are wagered on the result as in almost every other Indian contest of skill or chance. For the purpose of explanation we shall designate two of the five as ‘‘rounds” and the other three as ‘‘diamonds,” it being understood that only the marked side counts in the game, excepting when the throw happens to turn up the three ‘‘diamonds” blank while the other two show the marked side, or, as sometimes happens, when all five dice turn up blank. In every case all of one kind at least must turn up to score a point. A successful throw entitles the player to another throw, while a failure obliges her to pass the basket to someone else. The formula is:
1 only of either kind : = 2 rounds — 3 diamonds (both rounds with blank side up) = 3 diamonds blank (both rounds with marked side up) =3 4 marked side up silt 5 (all) blank sides up = 5 (all) marked sides up =
A game similar in principle, but played with six dice instead of five, is also played by the Arapaho women, as well as by those of the Comanche and probably also of other tribes.

combination of the sides which lie uppermost after they have fallen, determines the count of the throw.
The players sit opposite one another, and, if several are playing, in two rows facing each other. Each individual bets with the woman opposite to her. Each player is provided with eight sticks, which represent the points which she must gain or lose to win or lose the game. When a player has won all the sticks belonging to her opponent she has won the game and the stake.
There are several combinations of marks and blanks which count nothing for or against the player making the throw, except that she loses her chance to make another throw. Others entitle the thrower to receive one, three, or even all eight sticks, and each throw that counts anything entitles the player to another throw. All the players on the side of the thrower, i. e., in the same row, win or lose from those opposite to them as the thrower wins or loses. If the person making the first throw casts a blank, she passes the basket to the one sitting next her; if this one makes a throw that counts, she has another and another, until she throws a

blank, when the basket passes on. When the basket reaches the end of the line, it is handed across to the woman at the end of the opposite row, and in the same way travels down the opposite line.
In making the throw the basket is raised only a little way, and the stones tossed only a few inches high. Before they fall the basket is brought smartly down to the ground, against which it strikes with some little noise. Some of the throws are given below, the sides of the seeds being designated by their marks:
2 blanks, 2 bears, and 1 cross count nothing.
4 blanks and 1 bear count nothing.
5 blanks count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick.
3 blanks and 2 bears count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick.
1 blank, 2 bears, and 2 crosses count 1 point; thrower takes 1 stick.
2 blanks and 3 crosses count 3 points; thrower takes 3 sticks.
2 bears and 3 crosses count8 points; thrower takes 8 sticks, and wins the game.
The women do not sing at this game, but they chatter and joke continually as the play goes on.

It is played with thirteen pieces, nine of which are formed of bone and four of brass, all of circular shape (fig. 16). The right side of the eight pieces of bone are stained red, with edges and dots burned black with a hot iron; the reverse is white. The brass pieces have the right side convex and the reverse concave. The convex surface is bright, the concave dark or dull.
The first piece, called ininees, or ogima, represents a ruler. No. 2 typifies an amphibious monster, and is called gitchy kindbik, or the great serpent. No. 3 represents the war club. No. 4 isa fish (kenozha). No. 5 are small disks of brass, and No. 6, a duck, sheesheeb.

The game is won by the red pieces, the arithmetical value of each of which is fixed, and the count, as in all games of chance, is advanced or retarded by the luck of the throw. Nothing is required but a wooden bowl, which is curiously carved and ornamented (the owner relying somewhat on magic influence), and having a plain, smooth surface.
The author gives the counts for sixteen different throws from one hundred and fifty-eight down to two. Long! gives the following description of the bowl game among the
Chippewa:
Athtergain, or miss none but catch all, is also a favorite amusement with them, in which the women frequently take part. It is played with a number of hard beans, black and white, one of which has small spots and is called king; they are put into a shallow wooden bowl and shaken alternately by each party, who sit on the ground opposite to one another; whoever is dexterous enough to make the spotted bean jump out of the bow! receives of the adverse party as many beans as there are spots; the rest of the beans do not count for anything.
The following account, given by J. G. Kohl,’ who does not designate the particular tribe, probably refers to the Chippewa:
The game called by the Indians pagessan, and which I frequently saw played, the Canadians call le jeu au plat (the game of the bowl). It is a game of hazard, but skill plays a considerable part init. It is played with a wooden bowl and a number of small figures bearing some resemblance to our chessmen. They are usually carved very neatly out of bones, wood, or plum stones, and represent various things—a fish, a hand, a Goor, a man, a canoe, a half-moon, etc. They call these figures pagessanag (carved plum stones), and the game has received its name from them. Each figure has a foot on which it can stand upright.’ They are all thrown into a wooden bowl (in Indian onagan), whence the French name is derived. The players make a hole in the ground and thrust the bow! with the figures into it, while giving it a slight shake. The more figures stand upright on the smooth bottom of the bowl through this shake all the better for the player. Each figure has its value, and some of them represent to a certain extent the pieces in the game of chess. There are also other figures, which may similarly be called the pawns. The latter, carved into small round stars, are all alike, have no pedestal, but are red on one side and plain on the other, and are counted as plus or minus according to the side uppermost. With the pawns it is a perfect chance which side is up, but with the pieces much depends on the skill with which the bowl is shaken. The other rules and mode of calculation are said to be very complicated, and the game is played with great attention and passion.

MASSACHUSETTS. Massachusetts. William Wood, in his “‘ New England Prospect,”' relates the following:
They have two sorts of games, one called puim, the other hubbub, not much unlike cards and dice. Hubbub is five small bones in a small smooth tray, the bones be like a die but something flatter, black on the one side and white on the other, which they place on the ground, gainst which violently thumping the platter, the bones mount changing colors with the windy whisking of their hands to and fro, which action in that sport they much use, smiting themselves on the breast and thighs, crying out Hub Hub Hub. They may be heard playing this game a quarter of a mile off. The bones being all black or white make a double game: if three of one color and two of another, then they afford but a single game; four of a color and one differing is nothing. So long as the man wins he keeps the tray, but if he lose the next man takes it.
MENOMINEE. Wisconsin.
Dr. Walter J. Hoffman? describes the Menominee form of the game under the name of 4 kqa’ siwok.
It was frequently played in former times, but of late is rarely seen. It is played for purposes of gambling, either by two individuals or by two sets of players. A hem-
Menominee Indians. ispheric bowl (fig. 17), made out of the
‘pode St large round nodules of a maple root, is
cut and hollowed out. The bowl is symmetric and is very nicely finished. It meas-
ures 13 inches in diameter at the rim, and is 6 inches in depth. It measures 3 inch
in thickness at the rim, but gradually increases in thickness toward the bottom,
which is about an inch thick. There are forty counters, called ma‘atik, made of
twigs or trimmed sticks of pine or other wood, each about 12 inches long and from
+ to 4 inch thick. Half of these are colored red, the other half black, or perhaps left their natural whitish color.
The dice or aska'sianok consists of eight pieces of deer horn, about ? inch in diameter and } inch thick, but thinner toward the edges. Sometimes plum-stones or even pieces of wood are taken, one side of them being colored red, the other side remaining white oruncolored. When the playerssit down to play the bowl containing the diceis placed on the ground between the opponents; bets are made; the first player begins a song in which the other players as well as the spectators join. Ata certain moment the one to play first strikes the bowl a smart tap, which causes the dice to fly upward from the bottom of the bow], and as they fall and settle the resultis watched with very keen interest. The value represented by the position of the dice represents the number of counters which the player is permitted to take from the ground, The value of the throw is as follows:
First throw, 4 red dice and 4 white, a draw. Second throw, 5 red dice and 3 white, counts 1. Third throw, 6 red dice and 2 white, counts 4. Fourth throw, 7 red dice and 1 white, counts 20. Fifth throw, 8 red dice and 0 white, counts 40.
The players strike the bowl alternately until one person wins all the counters— both those on the ground and those which the opponent may have won.

hollowed to a depth of about inch in the center. This dish plays an important néle in the older legends of the Micmacs. Filled with water and left over night, its appearance next morning serves to reveal hidden knowledge of past, present, and future. It is also said to have been used as a vessel upon an arkite trip. The dice of caribou bone are six in number, having flat faces and rounded sides. One face is plain; the other bears a dotted cross (fig. 18). When all the marked or all the unmarked faces are turned up there is a count of five points; if five marked faces and one unmarked face or five unmarked faces and one marked face are turned up, one point results; if a die falls off the dish there is no count. There are fifty-five counting sticks—fifty-one plain rounded ones about 74 inches long, a king-pin! shaped like the forward half of an arrow, and three notched sticks, each presenting half of the rear end of an arrow. These last four are about 8 inches long. Three of the plain sticks form a count of one point, the notched sticks have a value of five points, while the king-pin varies in value, being used as fifty-second plain stick, except when it stands alone in the general pile; then it has, like the notched sticks, a value of five points. Thus the possible points of the connt are seventeen (one-third of fifty-one) on the plain sticks and fifteen (five times three) on the three notched sticks, a total of thirty-two; but by a complex system the count may be extended indefinitely. In playing the game two players sit opposite each other, their legs crossed in a characteristic manner, and the dish, or woltes, between them usually placed on a thick piece of leather or cloth. A squaw keeps the score on the

counting-sticks, which at first lie together. The six dice are placed on a dish with their marked faces down; one of the players takes the dish in both hands, raises it an inch or two from the ground, and brings it down again with considerable force, thus turning the dice. If all but one of the upturned faces are marked or unmarked,
‘Mr. anar informs me oe tie eS -pin is called kesegoo—‘‘ the Pre man ey that the notched sticks are his three wives and the plain sticks his children. The Micmac explains these names by saying that when a stranger calls the children come out of the wigwam first, then-the women, and then the head of the family; and this is the way it happens when one plays at woltéstomkwon. ‘The technical name for the king-pin is nandaymelgawasch and for the wives tkimoowaal, both of which names mean, they say, ‘it counts five’ and ‘they count five.’ Nan is the Micmac for ‘five,’ but no numeral of which I know appears in the second name.” Mr. Hager regards the polygamous element in the game as a good indication of its antiquity, if, he adds, ‘‘such indeed be necessary.” Referring to the passes described by Mrs. W. W. Brown, in her paper on the games of the Wabanaki Indians (see p. 708), he says: ‘These passes are made by*the Micmac in woltéstomkwon by passing the right hand rapidly to the left over the dish, and shutting it exactly as if catching a fly.” Wedding ceremonies among the Micmac were celebrated by the guests for four days thereafter. On the first day they danced the serpent dance, on the second they played football (tooadjik), on the third they played lacrosse (madijik), and on the fourth woltéstomkwon.

he repeats the toss and continues to do so as long as one of these combinations results. When he fails to score, the amount of his winnings is withdrawn from the general pile and forms the nucleus of his private pile. His opponent repeats the

dice-throwing until he also fails to score. Two successive throws of either a single point or of five points count thrice the amount of one throw; that is, three points or fifteen points, respectively. Three successive throws count five times as much as

He continues to add sticks thus as he continues to score. This use of the sticks as counters to indicate unpaid winnings is a device for deferring further settlement until the game seems near its end, and also serves to increase the count indefinitely to meet the indefinite duration of the game, as after one player secures a token his opponent, when he scores, merely reduces the former’s pile by the value of his score. The reduction is effected by returning from the token pile to the private pile the amount of the opponent’s score; hence at any time the token pile represents the amount of advantage which its owner has obtained since the last settlement. These settlements are made whenever either party may desire it; this, however, is supposed to be whenever a player's token pile seems to represent a value approaching the limit of his opponent’s ability to pay. If his opponent should permit the settlement to be deferred until he were no longer able to pay his debts, then he would lose the game to the first player; whereas, if one player after the settlement retains five plain sticks but not more, a new feature is introduced which favors him. If, while retaining his five sticks, he can score five points before his opponent scores at all, he wins the game in spite of the much greater amount of his opponent’s winnings up to that point. If his opponent scores one point only before he obtains his five points, he still has a chance, though a less promising one. If, after paying over the three plain sticks that represent a single point two plain sticks still remain to him, he is then compelled to win seven points before his opponent wins one or he forfeits the game; but if he succeeds in winning his seven points, the game is still his. However, in these last chances he is further handicapped by the rule that he can at no time score more points than are represented in his private pile. Consequently, if with only five plain sticks in his possession he could only score a single point, even if his toss should call for five; but with six plain sticks he could score two points; with nine sticks, three, ete. The last chances are: With only five plain sticks, five points are necessary to win; with three sticks, six points; with two sticks, seven points; with one stick, seven points. There are two other minor rules: One, that in counting five points on plain sticks four bundles of four each are given instead of five bundles of three each, as one should expect; total, sixteen. The other rule is that to count six points we use a notched stick plus only two plain sticks, instead of three, as might be expected.
This game may be regarded as an American analogue of the Chinese game of Chong iin ch’au (No. 27).
Mr. Hager states that the preceding game was invented and taught by the hero Glooscap. They also have a similar game called Wobinarunk, which, they say, was invented and owned by Mikehikch, the turtle, one of Glooscap’s companions, to whose shell the dice bear some resemblance.2. The name Wobiindrunk is derived from wobin, meaning dawn; to which is added a termination signifying anything molded or worked upon by human hands.°
'This system of scoring is identical with that used in Japan with the countingsticks, or sangi (Chinese, siin muk). One is indicated by a stick arranged vertically, and five by a stick placed horizontally. A set of sangiin the University Museum (Cat. No. 18306) (fig. 22), consists of one hundred and twenty-seven little wooden blocks, 1}? inches in length, and about + inch square in section. Sangi are, or rather were employed in Japan in the higher mathematics, the use of the soroban or abacus not being customary with scholars.

The outfit for the game consists simply of six dice, made from moose
or caribou bone, though one Micmac at least is positive that the teeth only of these animals can properly be used. In playing, these dice are thrown from the right hand upon the eround and the points are counted according to the number of marked or unmarked faces which fall uppermost. It is customary for a player to pass his hand quickly over the dice, if possible, atter he has tossed them and before they reach the ground, in order to secure good luck. The shape of the dice is that of a decidedly flattened hemisphere, the curved portion being unmarked. The base or flat surface is about the size of a 25-cent piece and presents three figures (fig. 23). ig. 23.

Southwest (see Cushing’s account of the white shell beads used in Sho’-li-we), the writer is inclined to believe that the name of this same /!obindrunk is derived from the use of wampum (wobun, “white,” so called from the white beads), as stakes for which it was played. Again, it may refer to the white disks; but, however this may be, a peculiar significance is attached to the use of shell beads as gambling counters or stakes. In the Chinese game of Fun {dn the stakes are represented by specially made white and black counters, known as white and black ‘‘ pearls.”
“Tn view of the numerical suggestiveness of dots and of the presence of that peculiar repetition of numbers which characterizes all triple multiples of the key number thirty-seven, it may be worthy of note that the number of dots included in the seven counts of the game is seven hundred and seventy-seven. The Micmac language contains native words for numbers as great as a million, and, as Dr. Rand says, is capable of indefinite numerical extension, a fact which surely appears to involve some knowledge of the properties of numbers. That certain numbers have been used as symbols in ritual and myth is quite as unquestionable among the Micmacsas among so many tribes and peoples, primitive and otherwise. The importance of such dice games in developing and extending the knowledge of numbers is self-evident. As to the figures upon the dice, the use of the cross from prehistoric times as a native symbol throughout the length and breadth of the Americas is too well known to justify further comment. The Micmacs painted it upon their canoes and wigwams and attributed to it marveious efficacy as a healing power. To play either Woltéstomkwon or Wobinarunk with dice from which the cross is omitted would be certain, they believed, to bring dire misfortune upon all participants. Several Micmacs have related to me, almost word for word, the same legend of the origin of the cross among them that was reported by Pere Leclercq at Gaspé more than two centuries ago; and it is noticeable that this legend contains no Christian element. They also associated this symbol with the four quarters into which they divided the land for the purpose of collecting medicinal roots and herbs, while a circle represents to them either that of their wigwam or of the horizon. The flat surface of the die, therefore, with its four crosses and surrounding circle, may symbolize the world

The count is as follows:
If 6 marked faces fall face up, 50 points. If 5 marked faces fall face up, 5 points. If 4 marked faces fall face up, 4 points. If 3 marked faces fall face up, 3 points. If 2 marked faces fall face up, 2 points. If 1 marked face falls face up, 1 point.
If 6unmarked faces fall face up, 5 points.
Total, 7 counts and 70 points.
The marks on the Micmac dice are similar to those on some of the inscribed shell beads known as runtees, found in the State of New York. One of these (fig. 24), (reproduced from Prof. W. H. Holmes’s Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans),' is from an ancient village site at Pompey, which Rev. W. M. Beauchamp, of Baldwinsville, New York, attributes to the seventeenth century. Mr. Beauchamp writes me that both sides are alike, and that it is pierced with two holes from edge to edge.

The looped figure may extend the fourfold division to the sky, or it may be merely a combination of the two other symbols. At least, that each design had some particular meaning can hardly be questioned, for the Micmac still objects to playing the game if one be incorrectly drawn. A comparison of the two Micmac dice games shows the same number of dice in each and the cross and circle appear on both sets, although in slightly differing size and design. The dice of one game are, however, never used in the other. Their counts differ radically, save that the ubiquitous number seven is prominent in both, and finally Wobindrunk lacks altogether the bow-and arrow elements and their mystic attributes. Still, the resemblance is sufficiently close to suggest a possible unity of origin.” (S.H.) ' Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1881, plate xxxrv, fig. 4,

The woman informed Mr. Starr that the game was called Altes tagen, and that if was played by two persons, one of whom places the counting sticks in a pile together. Then the stones are placed at random in the plate, which is held in both hands and struck sharply on the ground so as to make the stones fly in the air and turn before landing in the plate again. A player continues as long as he scores, taking counters from the pile of sticks according to his throw. When the pile is exhausted, each having obtained part, the game is continued until one wins them all. Three plain sticks count one point. ‘The three carved sticks each count four points,

He also says:
The chief gamesters among them much desire to make their gods side with them in their games; therefore I have seen them keep as a precious stone a piece of thunderbolt, which is like unto a crystal, which they dig out of the ground under some tree thunder smitten, and from this stone they have an opinion of success.
Nipissine. Forty miles above Montreal, Canada.
Mr. J. A. Cuoq! describes the plum stone gaine among this tribe under the name of Pakesanak, which he says is the usual name given to five plum-stones, each marked with several dots on one side only. Four or five women squatting around a blanket make the stones jump about the height of their forehead, and according to their falling on one or the other side the fate of the player is decided. Of late the game has been improved by using a platter instead of a cover (blanket), which caused the name of the ‘‘ game of platter” to be given it by the whites.
The name pakesanak is the plural of pakesan, defined as noyau, jeu. Dr. A. S. Gatschet has kindly given me the following analysis ef this word: pake = to fall, to let fall, s = diminutive, an = suffix of inanimate nouns.

This is shown by Indian words used in the games which Rasles interprets respectively: ‘I thrust a stick in the ground to mark the games;’ ‘I wina game from him; I place a stick,’ etc.; ‘He takes the mark for a game away from me; he removes a stick, etc.; ‘He takes away all my marks; he removes them all,” ete.

circle. The play consists in striking the edge of the bowl
jn such a manner as to throw all the beg-ga-sah-nuk into the air, and on the manner
in which they fall into the tray depends his gain or loss. If his stroke has been to
a certain extent fortunate, the player strikes again and again, as in the game of billiards, until he misses, when it passes to the next.

The Rey. Peter Jones? says:
In these bowl plays they use plum-stones. One side is burnt black and the other is left its natural color. Seven of these plums are placed in a wooden bowl and are then tossed up and caught. If they happen to turn up all white, or all black, they count so many. This is altogether a chance game.

It is played by two persons kneeling, a folded blanket between them serving as a cushion on which to strike the shallow wooden dish, named wal-tah-hd-mo'gn.

‘counting in this game there are forty-eight small sticks, almost 5 inches in length, named ha-gd-ta-ma-g’n'al; four somewhat larger, named ¢k’m-way-wal, and one notched, called non-d-da-ma-wuch (fig. 30).

All the sticks are placed in a pile. The disks are put in the dish without order; each contestant can play while he wins, but, on his missing, the other takes the dish. Turning all the disks but one, the player takes three small sticks; twice in succession, nine sticks; three times in succession, one big stick or twelve small ones. Turning all alike once, he takes a big stick; twice in succession three big ones, or two, and lays a small one out to show what is done; three times in succession he stands a big stick up—equal to sixteen small ones from the opponent—the notched one to be the last taken of the small ones, it being equal to three.
When all the small sticks are drawn and there are large ones left in the pile, instead of taking three from the opponent the players lay one out to show that the other owes three sticks, and so on until the large ones are won. Then, unless the game is a draw, the second and more interesting stage begins, and the sticks have different value. Turning all the disks but one, the player lays out one, equal to four from an opponent. Turning all the disks but one, twice in succession, he lays three out, equal to twelve from the other—three times in succession—stands one up, equal to one large or sixteen small ones. Turning all alike, he sets up one large one, twice in succession; then three large ones or, lacking these, three sinall ones for each large one. This would end the game if the opponent had none standing, as there would he no sticks to pay the points. But a run of three times of one kind in succession is unusual. When one has not enough sticks to pay points won by the other, comes the real test of skill, although the former has

nine sticks, he has five
chances—that is, he places the disks in position, all one side up, for each of the
tosses; the other contestant takes his turn at playing, but can not place the disks.
Then giving the dish a peculiar slide, which they call la luk, or ‘‘running down
hill like water,” and at the same time striking it down on the cushion, he may, unless the luck is sadly against him, win twice out of three times trying.
To this day it is played with great animation, with incantations for good luck and exorcising of evil spirits, by waving of hands and crying yon-tel-eg-wa-wiich. Ata run of ill luck there are peculiar passes made over the dish and a muttering of Mic-mac-squs uk n’me hd-ook (‘I know there is a Micmac squaw around”).
One of their legends tells of a game played by Youth against Old Age. The old man had much m’ta-ou-lin (magic power). He had regained his youth several times by inhaling the breath of youthful opponents. He had again grown old and sought another victim. When he found one whom he thought suited to his purpose, he invited him to a game of All-tes-teg-enik. The young man was also a m’ta-ou-lin, and for a po-he-gan had K’che-bal-lock (spirit of the air) and, consequently, knew the old man’s intention, yet he consented to a game. The old man’s wal-tah-hd-mo’y’n

was a skull, and the dll-tes-teg-enttk were the eyes of former victims. The game was a long and exciting one, but at each toss off by the young man the disks were carried a little higher by his po-he-gan until they disappeared altogether. This broke up a game that has never been completed. The legend says that the old man still waits and the young man still outwits hin.
Another Passamaquoddy game is deseribed by Mrs. Brown under the name of Wy-pen-og-enitk.
This game, like 4ll-tes-teg-eniik, has long been a gambling game. The disks are very similar, but larger, and eight in number. The players stand opposite each other with a blanket spread on the ground between them. The disks are held in the palm of the hand, and ‘‘chucked” on the blanket. ‘This game is counted with sticks, the contestants determining the number of points necessary to win before commencing to play.

hibited by the late Chief Joseph Nicolar of Oldtown. The latter furnished the writer with the following account of the game under the name of Wer-lar-da-har mun gun.
The buttons used as dice in this game are made from the shoulder blade of a moose; the counters of cedar wood. The latter are fifty-five in number, fifty-one being rounded splints about 6 inches in length, three flat splints of the same length, and one made in a zigzag shape. A soft bed is made in the ground, or on the floor, for the dish to strike on. ‘Two persons having been selected to play the game, they seat themselves opposite to each other. The buttons are placed in the dish and it is tossed up and brought down hard upon its soft bed. If five of the six buttons have the same side up, the player takes three round splints, but if the entire six turn the same side up, it is called a double, and the player takes one of the flat ones. The game is continued until all the counters are drawn.
It might naturally be inferred that remains of the bone disks used in the bowl game would be found in our archieological museums, but as yet [have not met with any. On the other hand small disks of pottery and of stone frequently marked on one face are not uncommon, and are usually classified as gaming implements.

SiKsikA (Blackfeet). Canada. Rey. Edward F. Wilson! says:
Their chief amusements are horse racing and gambling. For the latter of these they employ dice of their own construction—little cubes of wood, with signs instead of numbers marked upon them. These they shake together in a wooden dish.
Mr. J. W. Tims? gives katsdsinni as a general term for gambling.
Mr. George Bird Grinnell has furnished me with the following unpublished account of the stave game among the Blackfeet, which he describes under the name of O nes teh, ‘‘ The stick or travois* game.”
This is a woman’s gambling game, in vogue among the tribes of the Blackfoot nation, who know nothing of the basket or seed game so generally played by the more southern plains tribes.
Four straight bones—made frem buffalo ribs—6 or 8 inches long, + inch thick, and about # inch wide, and tapering gradually to a blunt point at either end, are used in playing it (Plate 5). Three of these bones are unmarked on one side, and the fourth on this side has three or five transverse grooves running about it at its middle, or sometimes no grooves are cut and the bone is marked by having a buckskin string tied around it. On their other sides the bones are marked, two of them by zigzag lines, running from one end to the other; another, called the chief, has thirteen equally distant holes drilled in, but not through it, from one end to the other. The fourth, called ‘‘four,” from its four depressions or holes, has four transverse grooves close to each end, and within these is divided into four equal spaces by three sets of transverse grooves of three each. In the middle of each of these spaces a circular Cepression or hole is cut. All the lines, grooves, and marks are painted in red, blue, or black.
These bones are played with, either by two women who gamble against each other or by a number of women who sit opposite and facing each other in two long lines, each player contesting with her opposite neighbor. Twelvesticks, or counters, are used in the game, and at first these are placed on the ground between the two players.
The player, kneeling or squatting on the ground, grasps the four bones in the right or left hand, holding them vertically with the ends resting on the ground. With a slight sliding motion she scatters the bones on the ground close in front of her, and the sides which fa?l uppermost express the count or the failure to count. Sometimes, but not always, {'e players throw the bones to determine which shall have the first throw in the gamc.
The person making a successful throw takes from the heap of sticks the number called for by the points of the throw-—one stick for each point. So long as the throw is one which counts the player continues to throw, but if she fails to count the bones are passed over to the opposite player, and she then throws until she has cast a blank. When the sticks have all been taken from the pile on the ground between them the successful thrower begins to take from her opponent so many of the sticks which she has gained as are called for by her throw. As twelve points

* The word travois (trapper, French) has been variously explained as coming from travail and from traineau. I believe, however, as stated in The Story of the Indian, p. 156, it is a corruption from travers or @ travers, meaning across, and referring to the crossing of the poles over the horse’s or over the dog’s withers (G. B. G.).

Length, 54 inches. Blackfeet, South Piegan Reserve, Montana.
Cat. No. 51693, Field Columbian Museum.
The game described was obtained by Mr. Grinnell from the Piegans of the Blackfeet Agency in northwestern Montana, on the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains. They live on Milk River, Cut Bank, Willow, Two Medicine Lodge, and Badger creeks; the southernmost tribe of the Blackfeet. It will be observed that the implements for this game are practically identical with those collected by Dr. Matthews from the Gros Ventres in Dakota (fig. 89). Concerning this Mr. Grinnell remarks:
The Gros Ventres of Dakota—by which are meant, of course, the Gros Ventres of the village, a tribe of Crow stock—are not very distant neighbors of the Blackfeet, and in fact the people of the old Fort Berthold village, the Gros Ventres, Rees, and
Mandans, have many customs, and even some traditions, which closely resemble those of the Blackfeet.

a game played by Navajo women under the name of Tsé d 1/1 or tsin-d 1/U:!
The principal implements are three sticks, which are thrown violently, ends down, on a flat stone around which the gamblers sit. The sticks rebound so well that they would fly far away were not a blanket stretched overhead to throw them back to the players. A number of small stones placed in the form of a square are used as counters. These are not moved, but sticks, whose positions are changed according to the fortunes of the game, are placed between them. The rules of the game have not been recorded.
Dr. Matthews?’ tells, among the early events of the fifth or present world, that while they were waiting for the ground to dry, the women erected four poles, on which they stretched a deerskin, and under the

shelter of this they played the game of three sticks, tsindi, one of the four games which they brought with them from the lower world.’ Another game of tossed sticks described by Dr. Matthews* was called taka-thad-sata,° or the thirteen chips. It is played with 13 thin flat pieces of wood, which are colored red on one side
and left white or uncolored on the other. Success depends on the number of chips which, being thrown upward, fall with their white sides up.

5 Takd-thad-sita was the first of four games played by the young Hastséhogan with the gambling god Nohoilpi. These four games are not the same as the four described as brought from the under world. They comprise, in addition, nanzoz, ‘‘ hoop and pole;” tsi/nbelsi/, or push on the wood, in which the contestants push on a tree until it is torn from its roots and falls, and tsol, or ball, the object in which was to hit the ball so that it would fall beyond a certain line. Compare the gambling episole with that of Poshaiyiinne, the Sia culture hero and the Magician. The four games played by them were not the same (see p. 730).

It seems hardly necessary to point out that he failed to comprehend the object of the game. PAWNEE.
In reply to a letter addressed by the writer to Mr. George Bird Grinnell, of New York City, he kindly wrote the following account ‘‘of what the Pawnee call the seed game:”
I have seen this game played among the Pawnee, Arikara, and Cheyenne, and substantially in the same way everywhere. The Pawnee do not use a bowl] to throw the seeds, but hold them in a flat wicker basket, about the size and shape of an ordinary tea plate. The woman who makes the throw holds the basket in front of her close to the ground; gives the stones a sudden toss into the air, and then moves the basket smartly down against the ground, and the stones fall into it. They are not thrown high, but the movementof the basket is quick, and it is brought down hard on the ground so that the sound of the slapping is easily heard. The plum stones are always five in number, blackened, and variously marked on one side. The

Pike! says:
The third game alluded to is that of la platte, described by various travelers (as the platter or dish game); this is played by the women, children, and old men, who, like grasshoppers, crawl out to the circus to bask in the sun, probably covered only with an old buftalo robe.
Speaking of the Central Eskimo, Dr. Franz Boas” says:
A game similar to dice, called tingmiujang, i. e., images of birds, is frequently played. A set of about fifteen figures, like those represented in fig. 42, belong to this game; some representing birds, others men and women. The players sit around a board or a piece of leather and the figures are shaken in the hand and thrown upward. On falling, some stand upright, others lie flat on the back or on the side. Those standing upright belong to that player whom they face; sometimes they are so thrown that they all belong to the one that tossed them up. The players throw by turns until the last figure is taken up, the one getting the greatest number of figures being the winner.

Mr. John Murdoch! describes similar objects which he purchased at Plover Bay, eastern Siberia, in 1881 (fig. 43). They were supposed to be merely works of art. Referring to the account given by Dr. Boas of their use as a game, he says:
Vig. 43. GAME (?) OF FOX AND GEESE. After Murdoch.
It is therefore quite likely they were used for a similar purpose at Plover Bay. If this be so, it is a remarkable point of similarity between these widely separated Eskimo, for I can learn. nothing of a similar custom at any intermediate point.
Mr. Murdoch refers to the game as mentioned by Captain Hall,’ who, speaking of the Central Eskimo, says:
They have a variety of games of their own. In one of these they use a number of bits of ivory made in the form of ducks.

Prof. Benjamin Sharp, of the Academy of Natural Science, tells me that he saw the carved water birds used as a game, being tossed and allowed to fall by Eskimo of St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia.
In reply to my inquiry in reference to the use of such objects in games by the Arctic Highlanders of Greenland, Mr. Henry G. Bryant writes me that small images of birds are rare among them, although

I understand that the leg bones of the arctic fox are sometimes tied together on a string, and at times these are thrown up and their position noted when striking the ground,
Mr. Bryant adds:
Perhaps they attach a significance to the position of the fox bones, which may be analogous to the practice of using wooden or bone dice by other tribes.
A set of carved ivory tablets (figs. 195-200), strung upon a throng, are described as among the properties of an Eskimo shaman in

In the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 7404) are four wooden blocks, said to be used in a game, from the Northwest Arctic Coast. These blocks (fig. 45), which were collected by Mr. R. Kennicott. have a rounded base marked with two transverse cuts. They are perforated as if for stringing. From the locality given they are probably Eskimauan.
In conclusion, reference should be made to a game described by Murdoch! among the Point Barrow Eskimo with twisters and marline spikes used for backing the bow.
Lieutenant Ray says he has seen it played with any bits of stick or bone. According to him the players are divided into sides, who sit on the ground about 3 yards apart, each side sticking up one of the marline spikes for a mark to throw the twisters at. Six of the latter, he believes, make a complete set. One side tosses the whole set, one at a time, at the opposite stake, and the points which they make
are counted up by their opponents from the position of the twisters as they fall. He did not learn how the points were reckoned, except that twisters with a mark on

them counted differently from the plain ones, or how long the game lasted, each side taking its turn of casting at the opposite stake. He, however, got the impression that the winning side kept the twisters belonging to their opponents. Mr. Nelson informs me that a similar game is played with the same implements at Norton Sound.
The present writer has repeated this account, from the general likeness of the implements (sinew twisters) (fig. 46) to the staves tossed as dice, rather from any clearly apparent identity of the games.
CHEROKEE. North Carolina.
I am informed by Mrs. Starr Hayes that the Cherokee play a game in a flat square basket of cane like the lid of a market basket, with col ored beans, under the name of ‘“ Black eye and white eye.” The shal. low basket used is 14 feet square. The beans are colored “butter beans,” a variety of lima, and those selected are dark on one side and white on the other. Twelve beans are kept as counters. Six others are put in the basket, as they come, and the players, who are four in number, and each two partners, play in turn. The basket is held in

both hands, slightly shaken, and then with a jerk, the beans are tossed in the air. If all turn black, two are taken from the counters; if all turn white, three are taken. If but one turns up white, one is taken from the twelve. When they turn five white, one only is taken. The game is played three or six times weekly. Whoever gets twelve beans has the game.
DELAWARE. See account by Loskiel on page 725.
Huron. Ontario, Canada. Charlevoix! gives the following account:
As I returned through a quarter of the Huron village I saw a company of these savages, who appeared very eager at play. I drew near and saw they were playing at the game of the dish (jew du plat). This is the game of which these people are fondest. At this they sometimes lose their rest, and in some measure their reason. At this game they hazard all they possess, and many do not leave off till they are almost stripped quite naked and till they have lost all they have in their cabins. Some have been known to stake their liberty for a time, which fully proves their passion for this game; for there are no men in the world more jealous of their liberty than the savages.
The game of the dish, which they also call the game of the little bones (jeu des osselets), is only played by two persons. Each has six or eight little bones, which at first I took for apricot-stones; they are of that shape and bigness. But upon viewing them closely I perceived they had six unequal surfaces, the two principal of which are painted, one black and the other white, inclined to yellow. They make them jump up by striking the ground or the table with a round and hollow dish, which contains them and which they twirl round first. When they have no dish they throw the bones up in the air with their hands; if in falling they come all of one color, he who plays wins five. The game is forty up, and they subtract the numbers gained by the adverse party. Five bones of thesame color win but one for the first time, but the second time they win the game. A less number wins nothing.
He that wins the game continues playing. The loser gives his place to another, who is named by the markers of his side; for they make the parties at first, and often the whole village is concerned in the game. Oftentimes also one village plays against another. Hach party chooses a marker; but he withdraws when he pleases, which never happens but when his party loses. At every throw, especially if it happens to be decisive, they make great shouts. The players appear like people possessed, and the spectators are not more calm. They all make a thousand contortions, talk to the bones, load the spirits of the adverse party with imprecations, and the whole village echoes with howlings. If all this does not recover their luck, the losers may put off the party to the next day. It costs them only a small treat to the company. Then they prepare toreturn totheengagement. Each invokes his genius, and throws some tobacco in the fire to his honor. They ask him above all things for lucky dreams. As soon as day appears they go again to play; but if the losers fancy the goods in their cabins made them unlucky the first thing they do is to change them all. The great parties commonly last five or six days, and often continue all night. In the meantime, as all the persons present, at least those who are concerned in the game, are in agitation that deprives them of reason, as they quarrel and fight, which never happens among savages but on these occasions and in drunkenness, one may judgt if when they have done playing they do not want rest.

It sometimes happens that these parties of play are made by order of the physician or at the request of the sick. There needs for this purpose no more than a dream of one or the other. This dream is always taken for the order of some spirit, and they prepare themselves for the game with a great deal of care. They assemble for several nights to try and to see who has the luckiest hand. They consult their genii, they fast, the married persons observe continence, and all to obtain ‘a favorable dream. Every morning they relate what dreams they have had and of all the things they have dreamt of which they think lucky and they make a collection of all and put them into little bags which they carry about with them, and if anyone has hat is, in the opinion of these people, of having a familiar spirit more powerful or more inclined to do good—they never fail to make him keep near him who holds the dish. They even goa great way sometimes to fetch him, and if through age or any infirmity he can not walk, they will carry him on their shoulders.
They have often pressed the missionaries to be present at these games, as they believe their guardian genii are the most powerful.
Brebeuf! describes the game as follows:
The game is also in great repute as a medicine, especially if the sick has dreamed of it. This game is a game of chance, pure and simple. They take six prune stones, white on one side and black on the other, put them in a plate, and shake the latter violently, so that the bones fall to the ground, showing one or the other side, as it may happen. The game is to get either all with the black side or all with the white side up. Generally they play village pitted against village. They all convene in a hut, and take places on benches ranged along the sides. The sick is carried in a coverlet, and the one who is to shake the plate (there is only one player for each side) walks after the sick, head and face wrapped in his robe. As soon as the player of the opposing party takes hold of the plate they cry aloud, Achine achine, achine, trois, trois, trois, or rather, ioio, ioio, ioio, desiring that either three white or three black be thrown by him. This winter you would have seen a good many returning to their village, having lost their breeches at a time when there was nearly 3 feet of snow, as frolicsome as if they had won. What I find the most remarkable thing about itis the preliminary arrangements. Some of them fast several days before the game is to take place. The evening before they convene in a hut, and by a ceremony try to find out the result of the game. The one who is chosen to hold the plate takes the stones, puts them in the plate, which he covers, so that nobody can touch them. After this they sing. After the song the plate is uncovered, and the stones are either all black or all white.
Thereupon I asked a savage whether the opposing party did not do the same, and whether they could not get the stones arranged in the same way. He answered “Ves.” “Nevertheless,” I said, ‘‘both can not win,” which he did not know how to answer. He told me, further, two remarkable things:
1. They choose for holding the plate someone who had dreamed that he won or who had acharm. Generally those who have one do not make a secret of it, but carry it about with them. They say that one person in our village rubs the stones with a certain ointment and never fails to win.
2. In making the trial some of the stones disappear and are found after a time in the plate with the others.
Father Lalemant? relates the following:
One of the latest foolish things which has happened in this village was occasioned by a sick person in one of the neighboring villages, who, in order to regain his health, dreamed or re ally gct the prescription of the local medicine man that a “oame of Kitteag ” should be played for him. He spoke about it to the headmen,

who soon convened the council and decided upon the date and the village which should be invited for this purpose, and this village was ours. A deputation was sent thence here to make the proposition, which was agreed upon, and then the necessary preparations were made by both parties.
This “game of platter” consists in tossing about in a wooden dish several wildplum pits, each being white on one side and black on the other, from which follows gain or loss, according to the rules of the game.
It is beyond my power to describe properly the earnestness and activity displayed by our Barbarians in getting ready and in seeking all means and signs of good luck and success in their game. They meet at night and pass part of it in shaking the plate to see who is the most adroit, and part in spreading out their charms and exhorting them. Toward the end they all sleep in the same cabin, having previously fasted and abstained for some time from their wives, all this to have a lucky dream, and the next morning they tell what has happened in the night. Finally, everything that they have dreamed could bring them good luck is collected and placed in bags for carrying. Besides this, they search everywhere for those who have charms affecting the game, or ‘“‘Ascandics” or familiar spirits to assist the one who holds the dish, and be nearest him when he shakes it. If there are any old men whose presence is recognized as efficacious in increasing the strength and value of their charms, not content with carrying their charms, they load them on the shoulders of the young men in order to carry them to the place of assembly. As we pass in the country for powerful sorcerers, they do not fail to give us notice to pray and perform many ceremonies to cause them to win.
As soon as they arrive at their appointed place, each party ranges itself along one or the other side of the cabin, filling it from top to bottom, under and above the “‘andichons,” which are of bark and made like a bed canopy or roof, corresponding to that below, fastened to the ground upon which they sleep at night. They place ihemselves upon the poles that lie and are suspended along the length of the cabin. The two players are in the middle with their seconds who hold the charms. Everyone present bets with someone else whatever he pleases, and the game begins.
It is at this moment that everyone sets to praying or muttering I know not what words, with gestures and violent agitations of the hands, eyes, and the entire face, all for the purpose of attracting good fortune to themselves and exhorting their particular spirits to take courage and not let themselves be worried. Some are appointed to utter execrations and make contrary gestures for the purpose of foreing bad luck upon the other side and frightening the familiar spirits of the opposing party.
This game was played several times this winter throughout all the country, but I do not know how it happened that the villages where we have missions were always unlucky to the last degree, and a certain village lost 30 porcelain (wampum) collars each of 1,000 beads, which is in this country, as if we said in France, 50,000 pearls or pistoles.! But this is not all. Always hoping to regain what they have lost, they bet tobacco bags, clothes, shoes, and breeches, in a word, all they possess, so that, if they are unlucky, as happened to these people, they return home stark-naked, having lost even their breech-clouts.
Nicolas Perrott? says:
The savages have also a sort of game of dice, the box of which is a wooden plate, well rounded and well polished on both sides. The dice are made of six small flat
‘The term pistole was used only asa money of account. It was generally equivalent to 10 livres tournois. The livre tournois was of 20 sous, in distinction from the livre of Paris of 25 sous. What the actual value would be no one can tell. It may be said that 50,000 pistoles was equal to 500,000 livres tournois at that time. (Personal letter from Prof. Dana C. Munro.)

pieces of bone, about the size of a plum stone. They are all alike, having one of the faces colored black, red, green, or blue, and the other generally painted white or any different color from the first-mentioned face. They throw these dice in the plate, holding the two edges, and on lifting it they make them jump and turn therein. After having struck the dish on the cloth, they strike themselves at the same time heavy blows on the chest and shoulders while the dice turn about, crying ‘ Dice! Dice! Dice!” until the dice have stopped moving. When they find five or six showing the same color, they take the grains which have been agreed upon with the opposite party. If the loser and his comrades have nothing more to play with, the winner takes all that is on the game. Entire villages have been seen gambling away their possessions, one against the other, on this game, and ruining themselves thereat. They also challenge to a decision by one throw of the die, and when it happens that a party throws six, all those of the tribe that bet on him get up and dance in cadence to the noise of gourd rattles. All passes without dispute. The women and girls also play this game, but they often use eight dice and do not use a dicebox like the men. They only use a blanket, and throw them on with the hand.
Sagard Theodat' says:
The men are addicted not only to the game of reeds (which they call ‘‘ Aefeara,” with three or four hundred small white reeds, cut equaily to a length of a foot), but also addicted to other kinds of game, as for instance, taking a large wooden platter with five or six plum stones or small balls, somewhat flattened, about the size of the end of the little finger, or painted black on one side and white on the other. They squat all around in acircle and take each his turn in taking hold of the platter with both hands, which they keep at a little distance from the floor, and bring the platter down somewhat roughly, so as to make the balls move about; they take it as in a game of dice, observing on which side the stones lie, whether it goes against them or for them. The one who holds the platter says, continually while striking it, ‘Tet, tet, tet,” thinking that this may excite and influence the game in his favor.
For the ordinary game of women and girls (at times joined by men and boys) are used five or six stones (as those of apricots) black on one side and yellow on the other, which they hold in their hands as we do dice, throwing the stones a little upward, and after they have fallen on the skin which serves them as a carpet, they see what the result is, and continue to play for the necklaces, ear ornaments, and other small articles of their companions, but never for gold or silver coin, because they do not know the use of it, so that in trade they barter one thing for another.
I must not forget to mention that in some of their villages they play, which we call in France, Porter les Momons (carry the challenge). They send a challenge to other villages to come and play against them, winning their utensils, if they can, and meanwhile the feasting does not stop, because at the least inducement the kettle is on the fire, especially in winter time, at which time they especially feast and amuse themselves in order to pass agreeably the hard season.
Huron (Wyandot).
Col. James Smith? describes the Wyandot as “playing a game resembling dice or hustle-cap. They put a number of plum-stones in a small bowl; one side of each stone is black and the other white; then they shake or hustle the bowl, calling hits, hits, hits, honesey,

honesey, rago, rago; which signifies calling for white or black, or what they wish to turn up; then they turn the bowl and count the whites and blacks.”
Iroquois. Western Pennsylvania and southern New York. Loskiel' gives the following account:
The Indians are naturally given to gambling, and frequently risk their arms, furniture, clothes, and all they possess to gratify this passion. The chief game of the Iroquois and Delawares is dice, which indeed originated with them. The dice are made of oval and flattish plum-stones, painted black on one and yellow on the other side. Two persons only can play at one time. They put the dice into a dish, which is raised alternately by each gambler and struck on the table or floor with force enough to make the dice rise and change their position; when he who has the greater number of winning color counts five, and the first who has the good fortune to do this eight times wins the game. The spectators seem in great agitation during the game, and at every chance that appears decisive cry out with great vehemence. The gamblers distort their features, and if unsuccessful mutter their displeasure at the dice and the evil spirits who prevent their good fortune. Sometimes whole townships, and even whole tribes, play against each other. One of the missionaries happened to be present when two Iroquois townships, having got together a number of goods, consisting of blankets, cloth, shirts, linen, etc., gambled for them. The game lasted eight days. They assembled every day, and every inhabitant of each township tossed the dice once. This being done, and the chance of each person noted down, they parted for the day. But each township offered a sacrifice in the evening to insure success to their party. This was done by a man going several times around a fire, throwing tobacco into it, and singing a song. Afterwards the whole company danced. When the appointed time for the game was at an end they compared notes, and the winner bore away the spoil in triumph.
MonHAawk. New York.
Bruyas’ in his radical words of the Mohawk language, written in the latter part of the seventeenth century, gives under Atnenha, “* Noyau” (stone of a fruit), the compounds TSatnenhaSinneton, “jouer avec les noyaux comme sont les femmes, en les jettant la main,” and TSsatennaseron, *‘y jouer au plat.”
ONONDAGA. New York. Rev. W. M. Beauchamp ® states:
Among the Onondaga now eight bones or stones are used, black on one side and white on the other. They term the game Ta-you-nyun-wdt-hah or, ‘ Finger Shaker,” and from one hundred to three hundred beans form the pool, as may be agreed. With them it is also a household game. In playing this the pieces are raised in the hand and scattered, the desired result being indifferently white or black. Essentially the counting does not differ from that given by Morgan (see p. 726). Two white or two black will have six of one color, and these count two beans, called O-yt-ha, or the Bird. The player proceeds until he loses, when his opponent takes his turn. Seven white or black gain four beans, called O-néo-sah, or Pumpkin. All white or all black gain twenty, called O-hén-tah, or a Field. These are all that draw anything, and we may indifferently say with the Onondaga, two white or black

for the first, or six with the Seneca. The game is played singly or by partners, and there is no limit to the number. Usually there are three or four players.
In counting the grains there is a kind of ascending reduction; for as two birds make one pumpkin, only one bird can appear in the result. First come the twenties, then the fours, then the twos, which can occur but once. Thus we may say for twenty, Jo-han-t6-tah, ‘you have one field” or more, as the case may be. In fours we can only say Ki-yae-ne-you-sdh-ka, ‘you have four pumpkins,” for five would make a field. For two beans there is the simple announcement of O-yv-ah, “bird.”
The game of peach-stones, much more commonly used and important, has a more public character, although I have played it in an Indian parlor. In early days the stones of the wild plum were used, but now six peach-stones are ground down to an elliptic flattened form, the opposite sides being black or white. This is the great game known as that of the dish nearly three centuries ago. The wooden bowl which I used was 11 inches across the top and 3 inches deep, handsomely carved out of a hard knot. A beautiful small bowl, which I saw elsewhere, may have been used by children. The six stones are placed in the Kah-odn-wah, the bowl, and thence the Onondaga term the game Ta-yune-o0-wah-es, throwing the bowl to each other as they take it in turn. In public playing two players are on their knees at a time, holding the bowl between them. Beans are commonly used for counters. Many rules are settled according to agreement, but the pumpkin is left out, and the stones usually count five for a bird and six for a field. All white or all black is the highest throw, and five or six are the only winning points. In early days it would seem that all white or all black alone counted. The bowl is simply struck on the floor. This ancient game is used at the New Year’s or White Dog Feast among the Onondaga yet. Clan plays against clan, the Long House against the Short House, and, to foretell the harvest, the women play against the men. If the men win, the ears of corn will be long like them; but if the women gain the game, they will be short, basing the results on the common proportion of the sexes. As of old, almost all games are yet played for the sick, but they are regarded now more as a diversion of the patient’s mind than a means of healing. The game of the dish was once much used in divination, each piece having its own familiar spirit. But it is more commonly a social game now.
SENECA. New York. Morgan! describes the Iroquois game under the name of Gus-ga-e-sd-td, or ‘‘deer-buttons.”
This was strictly a fireside game, although it was sometimes introduced as an amusement at the season of religious councils, the people dividing into tribes as usual and betting upon the result. Eight buttons, about an inch in diameter, were made of elk horn, and, having been rounded and polished, were slightly burned upon one side to blacken them . When it was made a public game it was played by two at a time, with a change of players as elsewhere described in the Peach-stone game. At the fireside it was played by two or more, and all the players continued in their seats until it was determined. A certain number of beans (fifty perhaps) were made the capital, and the game continued until one of the players had won them all. Two persons spread a blanket and seated themselves upon it. One of them shook the deer-buttons in his hands and then threw them down. If six turned up of the same color, it counted two; if seven, it counted four; and if all, it counted twenty, the winner taking as many beans from the general stock as he made points by the throw. He also continued to throw as long as he continued to win. When less than six came up, either black or white, it counted nothing, and the throw passed to the other player. In this manner the game was continued until the beans were taken up between the two players. After that the one paid to the other out of
' League of the Iroquois, Rochester, 1851, p. 302.

<<<Page: 936>>>

his own winnings, the game ending as soon as the capital in the hands of either player was exhausted. If four played, each had a partner or played independently, as they were disposed; but when more than two played, each one was to pay the winner the amount won. Thus, if four were playing independently, and after the beans were distributed among thew, in the progress of the game one of them should turn the buttons up all black or all white, the other three would be ebliged to pay

him twenty each; but if the beans were still in bank, he took up but twenty. The deer buttons were of the same size. In the figure ; upon which, if they all came up of one color, either white or black, it counted five. To pay this forfeit required the whole outfit of the first

In this manner the game continued, with varying fortune, until the beans were divided between the two sides in proportion to their success. After this the game continued in the same manner as before, the outfit of each new player being advanced by the managers of his own party; but as the beans or counters were now out of sight, none

but the managers knew the state of the game with accuracy. In playing it there were but two winning throws, one of which counted one and the other five. When one of the parties had lost all their beans, the game was done.
The implements for a Seneca bowl game in the possession of Mr. John N. B. Hewitt, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, obtained by him from the Seneca Indians, Cattaraugus Reservation, Cattaraugus County, New York, consist of a wooden bowl (fig. 50), 93 inches in diameter, and six dice made of fruit stones. A set of bone gaming disks from the same tribe and place, also in his possession, are represented in plate 6. As will be seen, they are eight in number, and marked on one side, in a similar way to those of the Micmac and Penobscot.
TUSCARORA (?), North Carolina. Referring to the North Carolina Indians, Mr. John Lawson! writes:
They have several other games, as with the kernels or stones of persimmons, which are in effect the same as our dice, because winning or losing depends on which side appears uppermost and how they happen to fall together.
Again, speaking of their gambling, he says’: Their arithmetic was kept with a heap of Indian grain.
He does not specify this game as played by any particular tribe in North Carolina, and it was probably common to all of them.
LAGUNA. New Mexico. Capt. George H. Pradt, of Laguna, writes as follows:
The game played with a circle of small stones is called, by the Keres pueblos, “Ka-wa-su-kuts.”3 The stones number forty, and are divided into tens by openings called doors or gates called ‘‘Si-am-ma;” the doors are placed north, south, east, and west.
In the center of the circle is placed aflat stone, upon which are thrown the three counters. These are flat pieces of wood about 4 inches long, + inch wide, and } inch thick; painted black on one side, and marked with 2, 3, and 10 marks, respectively. The counters are firmly grasped with the ends down, and forcibly thrown (ends down) on the stone in the center, in such a manner that they will rebound, and the marks, if any are uppermost, are counted, and the player lays his marker (a small stick like a peneil) between the stones the proper distance from the starting point to record the number. The starting point is one of the ‘‘doors,” whichever is selected, and the game is played by any number that can assemble around the circle. A player can go around the circle in either direction, but if another player arrives at the same point he ‘‘kills” the previous player and that one is obliged to go back to the starting point; the first one making the circuit successfully wins the game, which is generally played for a small stake. The game is modified sometimes by ruling that if a player falls into one of the doors he must go back, but in this case the player is not obliged to go back if another happens to mark as many points as he.
Sometimes a round stone is painted to resemble a face and has a wreath of ever-

greens placed around it, and is used as a mascot; it is placed to one side of the circle and is appealed to by the players to give them good numbers; this mascot is generally called ‘ Kfim-mishk-ko-yo,” a traditional fairy or witch. The name means ‘“‘the old spider woman.”
Sra. New Mexico.
Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson! describes the game as played by the Sia under the name of Wash‘kasi.
Forty pebbles form a square, ten pebbles on a side, with a flat stone in the center of the square (fig. 51). Four flat blocks, painted black on one side and unpainted on the other, are held vertically and dropped upon the stone.
The counts are as follows:
B20 0 uD io ee ay 4 painted sidesup =10 4 unpainted sides up = 6 3 painted sidesup = 3 2 painted sidesup = 2
1 painted side up
The players move in opposite directions, both starting at one of the corners. The game is described as the first of four games played by Po’shaiyinne, the Sia culture hero, with the tribal priest. The stake was the lJatter’s house in the north.
Be The second of the four games is of AeA app ane the bowl class, which I have included a eee. in this series. The stake in this game was the ti/dimoni, or priest’s, house in the west. It was played with six 2-inch cubes, which were highly polished and painted on one side. These were tossed up in a large bowl held with each hand. ‘ When three painted sides are up, the game is won; with only two painted sides up, the game is lost. Six painted sides up is equivalent to a march in euchre.” The games that followed were, first, a game played with four sticks with hollow ends, under one of which a pebble was hidden. ‘This was played for the priest’s house in the south. Second, a game played with four little mounds of sand, in one of which a small round stone was hidden. This was played for the priest’s house in the east. The games were then repeated in the same order commencing with Wash’kasi for the house in the zenith, the game with the six blocks for the house in the nadir, and finally, the third in order, that with the four sticks with hollow ends, for all the people of the tribe.
Mr. Charles F. Lummis informs me he has witnessed the game with the staves or blocks in the following pueblos belonging to this stock: Acoma, Cochité, Laguna, El Rito (Laguna Colony) and San Felipe.

The woman who composed Kiowa Indians, Indian Territory. this song tells how, on wakCat. No. 1529086, U.S.N.M. ipg up in the spirit world, she met there a party of her former girl companions and sat down with them to play the two games universally popular with the prairie tribes.
The first is called né! biéku! thana by the Arapaho and tsonrd or ‘fawl game” (from ison, an awl) by the Kiowa, on account of an awl, the Indian woman’s substitute for a needle, being used to keep record of the score. The game is becoming obsolete in the north, but is the everyday summer amusement of the women among the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache in the southern plains. It is very amusing on account of the unforeseen “rivers” and “ whips” that are constantly turning up to disappoint the expectant winner, and a party of women will frequently sit around the blanket for half a day at a time, with a constant ripple of laughter and good-humored jokes as they follow the chances of the play. It would make a very pretty picnic game, or could be readily adapted to the parlor of civilization.
The players sit on the ground around a blanket marked in charcoal with lines and dots and quadrants in the corners, as shown in fig. 6. In the center is a stone upon which the sticks are thrown. Each dot, excepting those between the parallels,
'The Ghost Dance Religion, Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1896, II, p. 1002.

<<<Page: 942>>>

counts a point, making twenty-four points for dots. Each of the parallel lines and each end of the curved lines at the corners also counts a point, making sixteen points for the lines, or forty points in all. The players start at the bottom, opposing players moving in opposite directions, and with each throw of the sticks the thrower moves an awl forward and sticks it into the blanket at the dot or line to which her throw carries her. _The parallels on each of the four sides are called “rivers,” and the dots within these parallels do not count in the game. The rivers at the top and bottom are ‘‘dangerous” and can not be crossed, and when the player is so unlucky as to score a throw which brings her to the edge of the river (i.e., upon the first line of either of these pairs of parallels) she “falls into the river” and must lose all she has hitherto gained, and begin again at the start. In the same way, when a player moving around in one direction makes a throw which
Ls \7 aS te FLT y aaa’

brings her awl to the place occupied by the awl of her opponent coming around from the other side, the said opponent is ‘‘ whipped back” to the starting point and must begin all over again. Thus there is a constant succession of unforeseen accidents, which furnish endless amusement to the players.
The game is played with four sticks, each from 6 to 10 inches long, flat on one side and round on the other. One of these is the trump stick, and is marked in a distinctive manner in the center on both sides, and is also distinguished by having a green line along the flat side, while the others have each a red line. The Kiowa call the trump stick sahe, ‘“‘green,” on account of the green stripe, while the others are called guadal, ‘‘red.”” There are also a number of small green sticks, about the size of lead pencils, for keeping tally. Each player in turn takes up the four sticks together in her hand and throws them down on end upon the stone in the center. The number of points depends upon the number of flat or round sides which turn

<<<Page: 943>>>

up. A lucky throw with a green, or trump, stick generally gives the thrower another trial in addition. The formula is:
1 flat side up ==ile
1 flat side up (if sahe) = 1 and another throw.
2 flat sides up (with or without sahe) = 2.
3 flat sides up =o.
3 flat sides up (including sahe) = 3 and another throw.
All 4 flat sides up — 6 and another throw.
All 4 round sides up = 10 and another throw.

unequally, they win nothing. They quit when one side has won all the stakes, In this game of beavers’ teeth (piiman tit) or woodchucks’ teeth (miuyam tét) they use twelve check sticks to count their gains with. The game is played by two persons, or by two partners on each side. Women only play this game.
The beaver teeth game may be regarded as a modification of the bone game, played by the Blackfeet. The four beaver teeth marked with circles or dots and lines arranged in chevrons clearly replace the four siinilarly marked staves. Again the tooth tied with sinew (see account by Mr, Eells, p.747) corresponds with the sinew wrapped stave. The counters, 2, agree with those of the Blackfeet.

inlaid with small red and white glass beads and bits of abalone shell. Collected by Stephen Powers. The game is thus described by the collector: '
The Yokuts have a sort of eambling which pertains exclusively to women. It is a <ind of dice throwing and is called u-chu’-us. For a dice they take half of a large acorn or walnut shell, fill it level with piteh and pounded charcoal, and inlay it with bits of bright-colored abalone shells. Fora dice-table they weave a very large, fine basket-tray, almost flat, and ornamented with devices woven in black or brown, mostly rude imitations of trees and geometrical figures. Four squaws sit around it to play, and a fifth keeps tally with fifteen sticks. There are eight dice, and they scoop them up in their hands and dash them into the basket, counting one when two or five flat surfaces turn up. The rapidity with which the game goes forward is wonderful, and the players seem totally oblivious to all things in the world beside. After each throw that a player makes she exclaims, yet’ ni (equivalent to one-y), or wi-a-tak, or ko-mai-éh, which are simply a kind of sing-song or chanting.

NATCHEZ. Louisiana.
Le Page du Pratz! says, referring to the women’s game of the Natchez:
These pieces with which they play are three little bits of cane from 8 to 9 inches long, split in two equal parts and pointed at the ends. Each piece is distinguished by the designs which are engraved on the convex side. They play three at a time and each woman has her piece. To play this game they hold two of these pieces of cane on the open Jeft hand, and the third in the right hand, the round side uppermost, with which they strike upon the others, taking care to only touch the end. The three pieces fall, and when there are two of them which have the convex side uppermost, the player marks one point. If there is only one, she marks nothing. After the first, the two others play in their turn.

red on one side, ‘which is flat and marked with black lines of numerical and sex significance.” Collected by Mr. W J McGee and Mr. William Dinwiddie. The game is described by the collectors under the name of Ghingskoot. The four marked faces receive the following names: (a) ‘Old man.” (ec) Young man.” (b) “Old woman.” (d) ** Young woman.” In the play the sticks are held vertically, bunched in the right hand, and struck from underneath on their lower ends by a stone grasped in the left hand, the blow shooting them vertically into the air (Plate 8).

McGee and Dinwiddie.
The game is played by tivo, three, or four players for self or partners, with counters called “horses.” These usually number two for each player. They are put into play consecutively and by alternate throws of the players. <A throw of less than five, which does not carry the horses out of the door (two), prevents a player from entering another horse until his aggregate throws are 5+, thus putting his horse into the rectangle proper. After all the horses of a single contestant are in play, he may move the same horse continuously. In counting the pockets, from “A” to either of the nearest corners, is 15. It is optional with the player whether he turns to the left or right upon leaving the door, thongh he must move his horse around the rectangle in the same

direction after once starting. If “xX” throw 15, moving to “a,” and “W” throws the same number, enabling him to move to the same point, he “kills” or throws “ X’s” horse out of play, and he must start his piece over again; and again, if he should throw 14, he accomplishes the same result (there is no “one” in the stick count). However, if “*X” should get to “ce” and ““W” throw 10 from “house,” and get to “d,” he does not kill him. If on the next throw “ W” throws 14 and ‘“ X” has not moved from ‘c¢” he kills him.
A horse must run entirely around the rectangle and back into the house pockets, where he is safe from being “ killed;” but to make him a winning piece, the exact number to count to ‘‘a” must be thrown by the sticks. When a horse is upon a pocket adjoining “a,” a two throw

Dr. Carl Lumholtz. i The preceding Tarahumara and Tepeguana specimens were all collected by Dr. Carl Lumholtz. He informs me that the Tepeguana call the game In-ti-vi-ga-i | 2u-li | ga-iré-ga-i, “game straight throwing.” It is also generally known by the Spanish name of Quince,! or “Fifteen.”
He states that it is played by all the tribes in Chihuahua who live in or near the Sierra, and by the Mexicans as well, but is not seen south of the State of Durango. It is not known to the Cora or Huichole in the State of Jalisco, or to the Tarasco of Michoacan.?
Fig. 67.
' Also in French, Quinze, ‘a popular game with cards, in which the object is to make fifteen points.” The name Quince does not appear to be confined among the Indians to the game played with staves. Mr. Edward Palmer describes the following game under the name of Quins (quince?) among the Pima of Arizona: ‘Any number can play. A short, split stick is first thrown in a slanting direction, and each one pitches his arrow to see who can come nearest to it. The one who does so holds the stick up while the others pitch. If the arrow touches the split stick and does not catch, the thrower loses nothing. If, however, the arrow remains in the split stick it becomes the property of the holder. The game ends when one has all the arrows or they tire out.”
*Mr.C. V. Hartman, who accompanied Dr. Lumholtz, informs me that Quince is played with four flattened reeds by the Zaque Indians of the Rio Fuerte in Sinaloa. They call the game in their language ké-zu-te.

<<<Page: 963>>>

Dr. Lumholtz informs me that Quince is played by throwing the four staves against a flat stone, the counts being kept around a diagram (fig. 67), which. consists of holes pecked in the rock, about 3 by 4 feet.
NISHINAM. California. Powers! gives the following account:
The ha is a game of dice, played by men or women, two, three, or four together. The dice, four in number, consist of two acorns split lengthwise into halves, with the outsides scraped and painted red or black. They are shaken in the hands and thrown into a wide, flat basket, woven in ornamental patterns, sometimes worth $25. One paint and three whites, or vice versa, score nothing; two of each score one; four alike score four. The thrower keeps on throwing until he makes a blank throw, when another takes the dice. When all the players have stood their turn, the one who has scored most takes the stakes, which in this game are generally small, say a “bit.”

Rev. M. Eells writes:
The dice are made of beavers’ teeth generally, but sometimes from muskrats’ teeth. There are two pairs of them, and generally two persons play, one on each Side, but sometimes there are two or three on each side. The teeth are taken in one hand and thrown after the manner of dice. One has a string around the middle. If this one is down and all the rest are up, or up and the rest down, it counts four; if all are up or down, it counts two; if one pair is up and the other down it counts one; if one pair is up or down and the other divided, unless it be as above, when it counts four, then it counts nothing; 30 is a game, but they generally play three games, and bet more or less, money, dresses, or other things. They sometimes learn very expertly to throw the one with the string on differently from the others, by arranging them in the hand so they can hold this one, which they know by feeling, a trifle longer than the others.

ber that I was satisfied that every piece represented a region. The bark cards were shuffled by tossing them in a little tray basket, or kaichoats, sometimes used by the women as caps, but having a more general use as gathering baskets. They were shaken up under the concealment of a blanket and tossed upon another blanket, and different arrangement produced different numbers, which were counted upon little ‘sticks. Each party in the game started with a definite number of these sticks, and the final winner was the one who accumulated all in his pile.

Denig, a manuscript! in the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, there occurs the following accounts of the bowl and stave game among the Assinaboin:
_ Most of the leisure time, either by night or by day, among all these nations is devoted to gambling in various ways, and such is their infatuation that it is the cause of much distress and poverty in families. For this reason the name of being a desperate gambler forms a great obstacle in the way of a young man getting a wife. Many quarrels arise among them from this source, and we are well acquainted with an Indian who a few years since killed another because after winning all he had he refused to put up his wife to be played for. Every day and night in the soldier’s lodge not ocenpied by business matters presents gambling in various ways all the time; also in many private lodges the song of hand gambling and the rattle of the bowl dice can be heard. Women are as much addicted to the practice as men, though their games are different, and not being in possession of much property their losses, although ‘considerable to them, are not so distressing. The principal game played by men is that of the bowl, or cosso-0d, which is a bowl made of wood with flat bottom 1 foot in diameter or less, the rim turned up about 2 inches, and highly polished inside andout. A drawing and a deseription of the arithmetical principles
of this game is now attached in Big. Ti. thisplace. Themanner of counting ASSINABOIN BOWL GAME. therein mentioned is the manner in From a sketch by Edwin T. Denig.
which we learned it from the indi-
ans, but the value of each of the articles composing the dice can be and is changed sometimes in default of some of them being lost, and again by agreement among the players in order to lengthen or shorten the game or facilitate the counting. However, the best and most experienced hands play it as it is represented. It can be played between two or four; that is, either one on each side or two against two. The game has no limit unless it is so agreed in the commencement, but this is seldom done, it being usually understood that the players continue until one party is completely ruined.
The dice and their counts are as follows:
One large crow’s claw, red on one side and black on the other, being the only one that will occasionally stand on end, in which case twenty-five for it is counted, besides its value of five when on its side.
Four small crow’s claws, painted the same as the large one, which count five each if the red side turns up; if the black, nothing.
Five plum stones, black on one side and scraped white on the other; the black sides turned up are valued at four each; the white sides nothing.
Vive small round pieces of blue china, $ inch in diameter, which count three each
for the blue side; the white side nothing.

COUNTs IN ASSINABOIN BOWL GAME,
From a sketch by Edwin T. Denig.
The bowl is held by the tips of the four fingers inside the rim, and the thumb underneath, The dice being put in, they are thrown up a few inches by striking the bottom of the bowl on the ground, so that each counter makes several revolutions. It is altogether a game of chance, and no advantage can be taken by anyone in making the throws. The counters or dice never leave the bowl, but are counted as the value turns up according to the plate inserted in this place describing the same. One person haying shaken it and the amount of his throw having been ascertained, a requisite number of small sticks are placed before him, each stick counting one.

<<<Page: 973>>>

In this way the game is kept, but each keeps his adversary’s game, not his own; that is, he hands him a number of sticks equal to the amount of his throw, which are laid so that all can see them. Each throws in turn unless the big claw stands on end, in which case the person is entitled to a successive throw. By much practice they are able to count the number turned up at a glance, and the principles of the game being stated on the drawing we will now describe how it is carried on. It has been observed in these pages, in references to their gambling, that it is much fairer in its nature than the same as carried on by the whites, and this is worthy of attention, inasmuch as it shows how the loser is propitiated, so that the game may not result in quarrel or bloodshed, as is often the case. The game is mostly played by the soldiers and warriors, and each must feel equal to the other in courage and resolution; it is often kept up for two or three days and nights without any intermission, except to eat, until one of the parties is ruined.
Example.—A plays against B; each puts up a knife, and they throw alternately until 100 is counted by dice; say A wins. B now puts up his shirt against two knives, which is about equal in value; say A winsagain. B then stakes his powderhorn and some arrows against the whole of A’s winnings. Should B now win, the game commences again at the beginning, as A would only have lost a knife; but, supposing A wins, B now puts up his bow and quiver of arrows against all A has won. Thestakes are never withdrawn but Jet hein front of them. Say A again wins. B then stakes his blanket and leggings, which are about equal in value to all A has won, or, if not, it is equalized by adding or subtracting some article. Supposing A again to be winner, he would then be in possession of 2 knives, 1 shirt, 1 blanket, 1 powderhorn, 1 bow and quiver of arrows, and 1 pair leggings, the whole of which the Indians value at 8 robes. B now stakes his gun against all the above of A’s winnings; now if A again wins, he only retains the gun, and the whole ot the rest of the property won by A returns to B, but he is obliged to stake it all against his gun in possession of A, and play again. If A wins the second time, he retains the whole, and B now puts up his horse against all of A’s winnings, including gun. If A wins, he retains only the horse, and the gun and everything else revert again to B, he being obliged to stake them again against the horse in A’s possession. if A wins this time, he keeps the whole, but if B wins he only gets back the horse and gun, and all the rest of the property goes to A. Supposing B again loses and continues losing until all his personal property has passed into the hands of A, then B, as a last resort, stakes his wife and lodge against ali his property in the hands of A. If A wins, he only keeps the woman; the horse, gun, and all other property returns again to B, with the understanding, however, that hestake it all to get back his wife. Now if B loses, he is ruined, but if A loses he gives up only the woman and the horse, continuing to play with the rest of the articles against the horse until one or the other is broke.
At this stage of the game the excitement is very great. The spectators crowd around and intense fierceness prevails. Few words are exchanged, and no remarks made by those looking on. If the loser be completely ruined and a desperate man, it is more than likely he will by quarrel endeavor to repossess himself of some of his property, but they are generally well matched in this respect, though bloody struggles are often the consequence. We have known Indians to lose everything, horse, dogs, cooking utensils, lodge, wife, even to his wearing apparel, and be obliged to beg an old skin from someone to cover himself, and seek a shelter in the lodge of one of his relations. It is, however, considered a mark of manliness ta suffer no discomposure to be perceptible on account of the loss, but in most cases we imagine this a restraint forced upon the loser by the character of his adversary. Suicide is never committed on these occasions. His vengeance seeks some other outlet—in war expeditions, or some way to acquire property that he may again play and retrieve his losses. There are some who invariably lose and are poor all their lives. A man may with honor stop playing with the loss of his gun. He has, also, a second opportunity to retire on losing his horse, and when this is so understoed at the commence-

ment they do; but when a regular set-to takes place between two soldiers, it generally
ends as above described. The usual game which women play alone—that is, without the men—is called Chunkan-dee, and is performed with by four sticks marked on one side and blank on the other, as described in the inclosed plate. The
women all sit in a circle around the edge of some skin spread upon the ground, each with her stake before her. One of them gathers up the sticks and throws them down forcibly on the end, which makes them bound and whirl around. When they fall the number of the throw is counted, as herein stated. The implements (fig. 79) are four sticks, 12 inches long, flat, and rounded at the ends, about 1 inch broad and 4 thick. Two of them have figures of snakes burned on one side and two the figure of a bear’s foot, All the sticks are white on the opposite side. 2 painted or marked sides and 2 white CONES eos 5 cee ee Se eee 2 All the white sides turned up counts. 10 3 burnt sides up and Ll white count.. 0 (N.

absence to play. Most of the women will gamble off everything they possess, even to the dresses of their children, and the passion appears to be as deeply rooted in them asin the men. They frequently are thrashed by their husband for their losses and occasionally have quarrels among themselves as to the results of the game.

Catlin! describes a game among the lowa under the name of Kon-thogra (“Game of Platter”).
This is the fascinating game of the women, and exclusively their own, played with a number of little blocks of wood the size of a half-crown piece, marked with certain points for counting the game, to be decided by throws, as they are shaken into a bowl and turned out on a sort of pillow. The bets are made after the bowl is turned, and decided by the number of points and colors turned.

Five plum-stones are provided, three of which are marked on one side only with a greater or smaller number of black dots or lines and two of them are marked on both sides; they are, however, sometimes made of bone of a rounded or flattened form, somewhat like an orbicular button-mold, the dots in this case being impressed. A wide dish and a certain number of small sticks by way of counters are also provided. Any number of persons may play this game, and agreeably to the number engaged in it is the quantity of sticks or counters. The plumstones or bones are placed in a dish, and a throw is made by simply jolting the vessel against the ground to make the seeds or bones rebound, and they are counted as they lie when they fall. The party plays around for the first throw. Whoever gains all the sticks in the course of the game wins the stake. The throws succeed each other with so much rapidity that we vainly endeavor to observe their laws of computation, which it was the sole business of an assistant to attend to.

Set of seven plum-stones, plain on one side and with marks burnt upon the other. Collected by Dr. Z. T. Daniel,' who describes the game as follows under the name of HKansu:
This is a very ancient game of the Sioux Indians, played usually by elderly women, although young women and. men of all ages play it. MNanswis an abbreviation of kanta su, which means plum-seed. They drop the ta and call the game kansu, because it is played with plum-seeds. It is used for gambling and amusement and is more like our dice than any other of our games. When playing, the seeds are thrown up in a basket or bowl and the markings on the seeds that are up or down decide the throw.
The seeds used are those of the wild plum of the Dakotas and indigenous throughout the northwest region of the United States generally. They are seven in number. On one side they are all perfectly plain and of the natural color, except some fine marks on four to distinguish them when the burnt sides are down, but on the reverse side of all there are burnt markings. These markings are made by a piece of hot iron, such as a nail, the blade of a knife, or a piece of hoop iron. Before the natives used iron they used a hot stone. Six of the seeds are in pairs of three different kinds, and only one is of a different marking from all the others. One pair is
' Kansu, a Sioux game, The American Anthropologist, V, p. 215.

<<<Page: 978>>>

scorched entirely on one side, another pair has an unburnt line about 2 millimeters wide traversing their longitudinal convexity (the remainder of their surfaces on that side being scorched); the remaining pair have one-half of one side burnt longitudinally, the other half of the same side unburnt, but traversed by three small burnt lines equidistant about 1 millimeter wide running across their short axes. The remaining and only single seed has an hourglass figure burnt on one side, the contraction in the figure corresponding to the long diameter of the seed. They are all of the same size, about 16 millimeters long, 12 wide, and 7 thick, and are oyal, having the outlines and convexity on each side of a diminutive turtle shell. When the Sioux first obtained our ordinary playing cards they gave to them, as well as to the game, the name kansu, because they were used by the whites and themselves for the same purpose as their original kansu. The men do not use the seeds or the original kansu now, but they substitute our cards. The women, however, do use the game at the present time. When a ration ticket was issued to them they gave it the name of kansu, because it was a card; so also to a postal card, business card, or

anything of the description of a card or ticket; a railroad, street-car, milk, store, or circus ticket would be called a kansu; so that the evolution of this term as applied to a ticket is a little interesting.
The description of the game kansu, as related by the Sioux is as follows: Any number of persons may play, and they call the game kansu kute, which literally means ‘‘to shoot the seeds.” When two persons play, or four that are partners, only six of the seeds are used, the hourglass or king kansu being eliminated. The king is used when a number over two are playing and each one for himself. The three-line seeds are called “sixes,” the one-line ‘‘fours,” those that are all black ‘“‘tens.” When two play for a wager they each pnt sixteen small sticks, stones, corn, peas, or what not into a common pile between them, making in all thirty-two. The play begins by putting the seeds into a small bowl or basket and giving it a quick upward motion, which changes the positions of the seeds, then letting them fall back into the receptacle, care being taken not to let any one fall out. The markings that are up decide the throw, precisely on the principle of our dice. As they count, they take from the pile of thirty-two what they make, and when the pile is exhausted the one having the greatest number wins the game. If all the white

sides are up, the throw countssixteen. The two ‘‘tens” up and four whites count sixteen. Two pairs up count six, and the player takes another throw. Two “sixes” down count four. If both ‘‘tens” are down, either side symmetrically, it counts ten. If all burnt sides are up, it is sixteen. If both ‘‘fours” are down, it is six. If two pairs are up, it counts two. One pair up does not count unless all the others are down. When more than two play, and each for himself, the ‘‘king” is introduced, Ifthe king is up and all the others down, the count is sixteen. If they are all up, the count is the same. If two pairs are up, the count is six. If the king is down and the remainder up, the count is sixteen.

Collected by Mr. Horatio N. Rust in 1873.
Comparison of the various accounts of the plum stone game as played by the Sioux shows many variations in the markings on the seeds. This is well illustrated in the account given by Schoolcraft,! who describes the game among the Dakota tribes under the name of /vuntah-so, which he translates as “the game of the plum-stones.”
He figures five sets of stones, each consisting of eight pieces.
Tn set A (Plate 12), Nos. 1 and 2 represent sparrow hawks with forked tails, or the fork-tailed eagle, Falco furcatus. This is the so-called war eagle. Nos. 3 and 4 are

the turtle, which typifies generally the earth. If 1 and 2 fall upwards, the game is won. If but one of these figures fall upwards and at the same time 3 and 4 are up, the game is also won. The other numbers, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all bianks. B denotes the reversed sides of A, which are all blanks.
Set C shows different characteristics. with a single chief figure (5), which represents the Falco furcatus. This throw indicates half a game, and entitles the thrower to repeatit. Ifthe same figure (5) turns up, the gumeis won. If nosuecess attends it by throwing up the chief figure, the throw passes to other hands. JI is the reverse of C and is a blank throw.
In set E, No. 5 represents a muskrat. The three dots (7) indicates two-thirds of a throw, and the thrower can throw again; but if he gets blank the second time, the dish passes on to the next thrower. Set F is invested with different powers. No. 1 represents a buffalo, and 2 and 3 denote chicken hawks, fluttering horizontally in the air. The chief pieces (5, 6, and 7) have the same powers and modifications as A.
To play this game, a little orifice is made in the ground and a skin put in it. Often it is also played on a robe. The women and young men play this game. The bow] is lifted with one hand abont 3 or 4 inches and suddenly pushed down to its place. The plum-stones fly over several times. The stake is first put up by a!l who wish to play. A dozen can play at once, if it be desirable.
Dr. H. C. Yarrow! refers to the plum stone game, in his paper on Indian mortuary customs, as described to him by Dr. Charles E. McChesney, U.S. A., among the Wahpeton and Sisseton (Dakota) Sioux.
After the death of a wealthy Indian the near relatives take charge of the effects, and at a stated time, usually at the time of the first feast held over the bundle containing the lock of hair, they are divided into many small piles, so as to give all the Indians invited to play an opportunity to win something. One Indian is selected to represent the ghost, and he plays against all the others, who are not required to stake anything on the result, but simply invited to take part in the ceremony, which is usually held in the lodge of the dead person, in which is contained the bundle containing the lock of hair. In cases where the ghost himself is not wealthy the stakes are furnished by his rich friends, shonld he haveany. The players are called in one at atime, and play singly against the ghost’s representative, the gambling being done in recent years by means of cards. If the invited player succeeds in beating the ghost, he takes one of the piles of goods and passes out, when another is invited to play, ete., until all the piles of goods are won. In cases of men, only the men play, and in cases of women, the women only take part in the ceremony. Before white men came among these Indians and taught them many of his improved vices, this game was played by means of figured plum seeds, the men using eight and the women seven seeds, figured as follows and as shown in plate 13. Two seeds are simply blackened on one side (AA), the reverse (aa) containing nothing. Two seeds are black on one side, with a small spot of the color of the seed left in the center (BB), the reverse side (bb) having a black spot in the center, the body beine plain. Two seeds have a buffalo’s head on one side (C) and the reverse (c) simply two crossed black lines. There is but one seed of this kind in the set used by women. Two seeds have the half of one side blackened and the rest left plain, so as to represent a half moon (DD); the reverse (dd) has a black longitudinal line crossed at right angles by six small ones. There are six throws whereby the player can win, and five that entitle him to another throw. The winning throws are as follows, each winner taking a pile of the ghost’s goods:
Two plain ones up, two plain with black spots up, buffalo’s head up, and two half moons up wins a pile. Two plain black ones up, two black with natural spot up, two longitudinally crossed ones up, and the transversely crossed one up wins a pile.

One of the plain ones up and.all the rest with black sides up gives another throw, and the same then turning up wins. One of the plain black ones up with that side up of all the others having the least black in them gives another throw, when the same turning

by the collector, was kindly placed in my hands by Mr, F. Webb Hodge, of the Bureau of American Ethnology: Grains of corn or pebbles are laid in the form of a square, in sections of ten each.
The two players sit on either side. The sticks, called e-pfe, are thrown in turn ona stone placed in the square. The counts are as follows:
2 flat and notched stick notches up ==) 5) 3 round sides up == lp) 3 flat sides up — 2 flat and 1 round side not notched up = 3 1 flat and 2 round sides not notched up= 1
The players move their markers between the grains or pebbles according to their throw, going in opposite directions. The one first returning to the starting point wins. Thisistheordinary way. Sometimes, the markers being considered as horses, a player will attempt to kill his adversary’s horses. In this case he so announces at the commencement of the game, and he then moves his marker in the same direction, and, by duplicating the first throw, or, if at any future stage of the game, always following, he succeeds in placing his marker where his adversary’s is, by so doing he kills that horse (marker) and sends him back to the place of beginning. The latter may then elect to move in the same direction as before, and kill and send back his adversary, but, if he wishes, he may go in the opposite direction, in which case he does no killing. The game is called Tugi-e-pfé, meaning ‘‘the thrown stick” (tugi ‘to throw’’).
Mr. Dozier states that the stick with fifteen notches gives rise to the Mexican name of Quince (fifteen), which is sometimes given its Tewa equivalent Tadi-piwa-no-pfe, and Juego de Pastor (Shepherd’s game).
TEWA. Isleta, New Mexico. Mr. Charles F. Lummis! gives the following account of the game in Isleta:
The boys gather forty smooth stones the size of the fist, and arrange them ina circle about 3 feet in diameter. Between every tenth and eleventh stone is a gate of 4 or 5 inches. These gates are called p’dy-hlah (rivers). In the center of the circle, pa-tol ndht-heh—‘‘pa-tol house,” is placed a large cobblestone, smooth and approximately flat on top, called hyee-oh-tee-dy. There is your pa-tél ground.
The pa-tol sticks, which are the most important part of the paraphernalia, are three in number. Sometimes they are made by splitting from dry branches, and sometimes by whittling from a solid block. The chief essential is that the wood be firm and hard. The sticks are 4 to 5 inches long, about an inch wide, and a quarter of an inch thick, and must have their sides flat, so that the three may be clasped together very much as one holds a pen, but more nearly perpendicular, with the thumb and first three fingers of the right hand. Each stick is plain on one side and marked on the other, generally with diagonal notches, as shown in fig. 89.
The only other requisite is a kah-nid-deh (horse) for each player, of whom there may be as many as can seat themselves around the pa-tol house. The ‘‘horse” is merely a twig or stick, used asa marker. When the players have seated themselves, the first takes the pa-tol sticks tightly in his right hand, lifts them about as high as his chin, and, bringing them down with a smart vertical thrust, as if to harpoon the center stone, lets go of them when they are within some 6 inches of it. The three sticks strike the stone as one, hitting on their ends squarely, and, rebounding several inches, fall back into the circle. The manner in which they fall

decides the ‘denomination ” of the throw, and the different values are shown in fig. 89. Although at first flush this might seem to make it a game of chance, nothing could be farther from the truth. Indeed, no really aboriginal game is a true game of chance; the invention of that dangerous and delusive plaything was reserved for civilized ingenuity.
An expert pa-tol player will throw the number he desires with almost unfailing certainty by his arrangement of the sticks in his hand and the manner and force with which he strikes them down. Itisa dexterity which any one may acquire by sufficient practice, and only thus. The five-throw is deemed
very much the hardest of all, and I have certainly found it so. | 3 According to the number of his throw the player moves his
marker an equal number of stones ahead on the circle, using one of the ‘‘rivers” as a starting point. If the throw is five,
for instance, he lays his ‘‘horse” between the fourth and fifth
;, Stones, and hands the pa-tol sticks to the next man. If his throw be ten, however, as the first man’s first throw is very certain to be, it lands his horse in the second ‘‘river,” and he has another throw. The second man may make his starting point
jo the same or another ‘‘river,” and may elect to run his “horse” around the circle in the same direction that the first is going or
in the opposite. Ifin the same direction, he will do his best to
Y make a throw which will bring his ‘‘horse” into the same M 15 notch as that of the first man,in which case the first man is
IN “killed,” and has to take his ‘‘horse” back to the starting
Fic. 89. point to try over again when he gets another turn. In case the counts In pa-ro.. second man starts.in the opposite direction—which he will not rom Lannie: do unless an expert player—he has to calculate with a good deal
of skill for the meeting, ‘‘to kill” and to avoid being ‘‘ killed” by No. 1. When he starts in the same direction as No. 1, he is behind, and runs no chance of being “killed,” while he has just as good a chance to kill. But if, even then, a high throw carries him ahead of the first man—for
“jumping” does not count either way, the only ‘‘ killing” a xy being when two “horses” come in the same notch—his rear is in 2 danger, and he will try to run on out of the way of his pursuer \ \
as fast as possible. The more players the more complicated
the game, for each ‘‘horse” is threatened alike by foes that
chase from behind and charge from before, and the most skillful 3 player is liable to be sent back to the starting point several
times before the game is finished, which is as soon as one
“horse” has made the complete cireuit. Sometimes the
players, when very young or unskilled, agree there shall be 5 no ‘“‘killing;” but unless there is an explicit arrangement to
that effect, “killing” is understood, and it adds greatly to the ;
interest of the game. There is also another variation of the game, a rare one, how‘ 10 ever. In case the players agree to throw fifteens, all the pa-tol F
sticks are made the same, except that one has an extra notch
to distinguish it from the others. Then the throws are as shown in fig. 90.

I feel quite confident I saw it also in San Juan (Tewan), though of that I would not be positive. [ can not remember seeing the game played in Jemez, Picuris, and Pojoaque (Tewan); in Sia (Keresan) or any of the Moqui Pueblos except Tehua (which of course is a village of migration from the Rio Grande). In Nambé ( Tewan) I never saw it, I am sure.

A circle, from 2 to 3 feet in diameter (fig. 92), is marked on the ground with small stones. One hundred and sixty stones are used, with larger ones at each quarter, dividing the circle into four quarters of forty stones each. A line AB is marked out as a ‘‘river,” and is usually marked from east to west. The line CD is designated as a ‘‘trail.” A large stone is placed in the center.
There are two players, each of whom takes one of the little twigs, which are known as ‘‘horses.” A player takes the three

; Re meets K’s horse anywhere around the circle, K’s horse is said to
be “killed,” and has to go back to A and start over again, and vice versa. A chief
point in the game is to reach B before the other player, so as to kill him on the second half of the circle.

The preceding Zunian staves were collected by Col. James Stevenson. They were all used, as I am informed, by Mr. Cushing, for the game of Ta’-sho'-li-we, or “ wooden canes” (one of the seven sacred ganies of Zuni), which he described to me as follows:
Ta'-sho'-li-we? is played according to the throws of three wooden blocks, painted red on ove side and black upon the other, around a circle of stones placed upon the sand. Two or four players engage, using two or fonr splints as markers, and advancing, according to their throws around the circle, which is divided into forty parts by
'Deal boards, imported into Zuni. * Ta’-sho'-li-we was described by John G. Owens (‘‘Some Games of the Zuni’) in the Popular Science Monthly for May, 1891. He gives the name of the central stone as

<<<Page: 998>>>

pebbles or fragments of pottery, and has four openings called “doorways” at its four quarters. At the commencement of the game four colored splints are arranged at these points: at the top (North) a yellow splint; at the left (West) a blue; at the bottom (South) a red, and at the right (East) a white splint. The blocks are tossed ends down on a disk of sandstone placed in the middle of the circle, and the counts are as follows:
3 red sides up ==) ((0) 3 black sidesup = 5 2 red and one black = 3 2 black and onered = 2
A count of ten gives another throw. When four play, the straws of the North and West move around from right to left, and those of the South and Kast from left to right. When a player’s move terminates at a division of the circle occupied by an
Fig. 102. SET OF BLOCKS FOR GAME OF TA’-SHO/-LI-WE.

adversary’s straw, he takes it up and sends it back to the beginning. It is customary to make the circuit of the stones four times, beans or corn of different colors being used to count the number of times a player has gone around. The colors on the wooden blocks or dice symbolize the two conditions of men:
Red, light or wakefulness ;
Black, darkness or sleep.
The splints have the following symbolism:
At top, yellow, north, air, Winter;
a-rey-ley and the dice ta-mey. For counting, each player hasa horse or touche. ‘The horse is supposed to drink at the intervals between the groups of stones. One game
which I witnessed had loaded rifle cartridges for stakes. Each player placed his bet within the circle.”

the inside charred at the edges, and unlike the sacrificial sets, which consist of common marsh reed. Mr. Cushing has kindly placed in my hands the following hitherto unpublished account of Sho/-li-we: |
The game of Sho’-li-we is certainly the most distinctive of any practiced by the Zuni Indians. It is not confined to them, but forms of it are found among all the
(p. 773). The names of the four sticks he gives as follows: The one whose concave side is entirely black, quin, the Zuni for black; the one with one black end, path-to; with two black ends, ko-ha-kwa; and the one with a black center, ath-lu-a. He figures two of the reeds, and the manner of holding the sticks, which he describes as thrown with the right hand against a suspended blanket and allowed to fall on another blanket. ‘‘Two of the pieces belong to each man and are companions. There is a pool with twelve markers, and he who wins the markers wins the game. The winner takes the twelve markers up into his hands and breathes on them. This is because they have been good to him and allowed him to win. It is wholly a game of chance, and horses, guns, saddles, and everything are staked upon the throw.

<<<Page: 1006>>>

more settled of the present Indians in both our own southwest, and in northern, western, and central Mexico; while variants of it and derived games may be traced over well-nigh the whole western half of our continent.
A study of the distinctive marks of the different sticks or cane slips used in this game by the Zuni would seem to indicate that this peculiar form of it is the most primitive. The reason for this will subsequently appear.
The name sho’-li-we is derived from sho 0 li, ‘arrow,’ and we, plural ending, signifying ‘“‘parts of,” shé we being the plural of simple arrows. Shé 0 li, or “arrow,” is derived in turn from shé o le, ‘‘cane,” the termination /i in the derived word being a contraction of li a, and signifying “out of,” ‘‘from,” or ‘‘made of.” Thus, the name of the game may be translated ‘‘cane arrows,” or ‘‘cane arrow pieces” or “arts.”
These ‘‘parts” consist of four slips of cane. From the fact that these slips are so split and cut from the canes as to include at their lower ends portions of the joints or sept of the canes, and from the further fact that they are variously banded with black or red paint, or otherwise, it may be seen that they represent the footings or shaftments of cane arrows in which the sept at the lower ends serve as stops for the footing or nocking-plugs. }
A study of the bandings by which these cane slips are distinguished from one another reveals the very significant fact that they are representative of the ribbandings of cane-arrow shaftments.
I have found that sets of Zuni, as well as the ancestral Cliff Dweller arrows, were thus ribbanded with black or red paint to symbolize, in the arrows so marked, the numerical and successional values of the Four Quarters, each set, especially of war arrows, consisting of four subsets, the shaftments of each differently marked. The reasons for this, and processes of divination by which the members of the different sets among the arrows were determined during their manufacture, I have set forth in a paper on ‘‘ The Arrow,” published in the Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1895, and also in the American Anthropologist for October of the same year.
In the second part of that paper, the publication of which was delayed by my Florida explorations, I proceeded to show how these various facts indicated quite clearly that the Zuni game of Sho’-li-we was, as itsname implied, developed from the use of actual arrows as divination; and I further instanced many ceremonial usages of simple or ceremonial arrows in such divinatory processes as further demonstrating this claim.
It may be well for me to preface a description of the four cane slips constituting the principal apparatus of the game by a statement or two relative to the successional numbers of the Four Quarters as conceived in Zuni dramatography.
The Chief or ‘‘ Master” region, as well as the first, is the North, designated the Yellow; believed to be the source of breath, wind, or the element Air, and the place of ieanter: ; hence of violence or war, and therefore Masculine.
The next or second region is the West, designated the Blue; believed to be the source of moisture or the element Water and the place of Gril gs or renewal and fertility ; hence of birth, and therefore Feminine.
The next, or third, is the South, designated as the Red; believed to be the source
mh he canes are Sout with reference to the notion that one side is masculine or north, and the other feminine or south. This is determined by the direction or character of the natural growth, as well as by the presence or absence of the leaf pocket in the joint on the one side or the other of that particular section which forms the shaftment of the arrow (Cushing). In ancient China, according to the Chow Le (LXII, 37), the arrow maker floated the arrow longitudinally upon water to determine the side which corresponded to the principle of inertia and the side which corresponded with the principle of activity. The former sank, while the latter rose. He cut the notch with reference thereto.

of heat or the element Fire, and the place of Summer, of growth and productivity ; hence of fostering, and likewise Feminine.
The last, or fourth of the earthly regions represented in the ordinary sheaf of arrows and in the game, is the East, designated the White, and believed to be the source of seeds and the element Earth, and the place of Autumn, of new years, and hence of creation; therefore Masculine again.!
These various regions and their numbers and meanings are symbolized on the arrows of the Four Quarters by differences in their ribbandings (fig. 110).
Those of the North were characterized by a single medial ribbanding around the shaftment, sometimes of yellow, but more usually of black, the color of death.

From a sketch by Frank Hamilton Cushing.
Those of the West were also singly ribbanded coextensively with the shaftment, but there was oftentimes a narrow terminal band at either end of this broad band, sometimes of blue or green, but usually of black.
‘Lhose of the South were characterized by two bands midway between the two ends and the middle, sometimes of red, but usually of black.
Those of the East were characterized by either two narrow bands at either end, leaving the whole medial space of the shaftment white, or more often by a single band at the upper end of the shaftment, sometimes composed of two narrow black fillets inclosing white, but usually merely black and not double.

In the highly finished arrows the cock or ‘‘tail” feathers were notched and tufted to correspond numerically and positionally with the bandings, for mythic reasons into which it is not necessary to enter here.
Each of the four cane slips was banded to correspond with the ribbandings of one or another of these sets of the arrows of the Four Quarters; but the paint bands (fig. 105) were almost invariably black and were placed in the concavity of the cane slips (figs. 106-9), not on the periphery (which was, however, scorched, scored, or carved to correspond), evidently to keep the paint from being worn off by handling ana casting.
Thus the cane slip of the North was banded only at the middle, and was called d-thlu-a, or the “All Speeder,” or ‘Sender” (4, “all,” and thlu-ah, “to run,” ““speed,” or ‘‘stand ready”).
The cane slip of the West was blackened its full length and was called K’wi'-nikwa, or the ‘‘ Black” (medicine), from K’wi-nd, “black,” and ak'-kwa, “medicine” or ‘‘sacred.”
The cane slip of the South was doubly banded, as was the arrow of the South, and was called pathl-to-a, or ‘‘ divider divided” ( ‘‘ bordered, inclosed”’), from pathI-to, “border,” ‘‘edge,” ‘‘end,” and oa, ‘‘to become,” ‘‘to do,” or ‘‘make to do.”
Finally, the cane slip of the East was banded only at one end, and was called Ko'-ha-kwa, the ‘‘ White,” or the ‘‘ White Medicine” (A’ha-na, ‘‘ white,” and ak-kwa, “medicine ”).
In addition to the banding and scoring of these cane slips, they were, in cases of great importance (as in sets made from the captured arrows of some celebrated foeman), notched at the ends, as I have said the cock feathers were notched; but this old practice has fallen into disuse to such extent that I have seen only one venerated set so notched. In this set, if I observed aright, the notches corresponded in number as well as in place, whether at sides or in the middle of the ends, with the number and positions of the bandings and of the tuftings on the cock feathers of the arrows from which, probably, they were made. The normal numerical value of the cane slips agreed with the successional values of the regions they belonged to—that is, the slip of the North made one; that of the West two; thatof the South three, and that of the East four. But as this gave unequal values, other values or counts were added, according as the slips fell concave or convex sides uppermost, and especially according to the thrower.
That this may be understood, the general nature of the game as essentially a sacred tribal process of divination must be considered. Formerly Sho/-li-we was exclusively a game of war divination, and was played only by Priests of the Bow, members of the esoteric society of war shamans.
These members were, according to their totems and clans, members of the clan groups corresponding to the several quarters or sacred precincts of North, West, South, East, Upper, Lower, and Middle regions. But since there were only four regions concerned in the wage of war, clansmen of the upper and nether regions were relegated to the east and west, since the places of the upper and lower regions in the sacred diagram were in the Northeast—between the East and North, and in the Southwest—between the West and South; while clansmen of the middle might, as determined by the casts of their arrow canes, belong to anyone of the other regions, since the midmost was the synthetic region, the all-containing and the allcontained place, either the first, therefore, or the last. This war game of the Priests of the Bow was played semiannually at the festivals of the Twain Gods of War, Ahaiyuta and Matsailema, patrons of the game by virtue of the vanquishment of the Creational God of Gambling, Mi’-si-na, the Kagle-star God, whose forfeited head now hangs in the Milky Way, and whose birds are the god-servants of war and the plumers of the canes of war.
It is played at such times as a tribal divination; a forecast for war or peace, for prosperity or adversity, and is accompanied by tribal hazards and gambling. But at other times it is played for the determination of peace or war, of the direction or

<<<Page: 1009>>>

precautions to be taken in defensive or offensive operations or preparations. As thus played, there must be four participants. Each possesses his own canes. In the uppermost room of the Pueblo (now fallen), there was formerly a shrine of the game. Here during terrific sand storms or at night the players gathered to divine. To the middle of the ceiling was suspended a jical or large round bowl-basket, over which a deerskin was stretched like a drumhead. Immediately below this, spread over a sacred diagram of prayer meal representing the terrace or cloud bed of the Four Quarters, on the floor, was a buffalo robe, pelt side up, head to the east, left side to the north, ete. (fig. 104). Upon this pelt a broken circle was traced either in black lines or dots, and with or without grains of corn (forty for each line, the colors corresponding to the quarters as above described), and the openings (canyons or passageways) occurring at the four points opposite the four directions. (It should be observed that a cross (+) was sometimes painted both on the center of the skin on the basket drum and on the hid« beneath, the upper symbolic of Ahaiyuta, and the lower of Matsailema, the Twin War Gods. )
The four players chose their places according to the clan groups and directions or quarters they represented: the player of the North between the eastern and northern passageway; the player of the West between the northern and western passageway, and so on. The players of the East and North represented war, and (in other modes of the game) masculinity; those of the West and South, peace and femininity.

Before taking their places they muttered prayers, or rather rituals, clasping the playing canes lengthwise between the palms, breathing deeply, and from the close of the prayers, repeatedly upon them, rubbing and shuffling them vigorously, from which comes the title of a skilled player or a gambler: shos-li, ‘‘cane rubber” or “cane shuffler.” As they took their seats, each placed under the edge of the buffalo hide in front of his place the pool, consisting of sacred white shell beads, or of little tablets representative of various properties and thus forming a kind of currency, since these little symbols were redeemable in the properties they represented or in commodities of equal value by agreement. Each also laid down at his right side on the edges of the robe over the pool two kinds of counters, usually a set of counting straws of broom grass, about six or seven inches long, worn by much use, and varying in number according to the proposed game, From ten to forty or forty-two, or from one hundred to one hundred and two (this latter divided at random into four bundles), was selected by each player. The additional counters were supplied by beans or corn grains, each set, or the set of each player, being of hisappropriate color, Four splints, the moving pieces of the game, were laid in their places by the left sides of the passageways.

<<<Page: 1010>>>

Each player then shuffled his cane cards back and forth in his palms as before deselibed, as though to smooth and heat them, addressed them, especially the stick of his special quarter, as (for the East) ‘‘ Tchim-mi ko-ha-kwa tat yathl ta ti!” “Now then, white one, come thou uppermost!’ Then laying the all-sender (or his special slip as such) across the two middle fingers and the other three slips upon it inside of one another, his thumb pressing over their midst, the ends pointed outward over the index tinger, and the bases held down to the base of the palm by the bent-over little finger (fig. 111), he quickly breathed or puffed upon them, shouted at them, and cast them skillfully against the stretched skin of the basket, so that they rebounded swiftly and fell almost unerringly within the circle on the pé wine or bed of buffalo hide. Now it was noted which slip lay uppermost over the others. If the White man threw, and if the white stick lay uppermost over all the others, he uttered

thanks and the cast counted him four and gave him the privilege of another cast. If, moreover, all three slips (except his sender) lay concave sides upward, they counted him ten and gave him a second additional throw. If all three fell convex side up, they counted him five. If two concave sides and one convex side up, they counted him three, and if two convex sides and one concave side up they counted him only one. The player who had the largest number of both kinds of counts after each had tried, led off in the game and was supposed to be favored by the gods at the beginning. With but a slight change in the system of the counting, the game was continued; that is, the double counts were kept if the process included gambling—that is, ‘willingness to sac rifice’—but only the counts according to the regions, if the game was purely an arrow or war divination. But it is to be noted that in either case an ingenious method was resorted to in order to equalize the counts. Since the North or Yellow man could gain only one anda double throw if his slip

<<<Page: 1011>>>

came uppermost, he gained the count of his opponent of the South, if his slip, the slip of the North, fell uppermost on the Red man’s slips. The latter thus forfeited alike his double throw and his appropriate number, three. The tally of these purely cosmical counts was kept with the bundle of splints; the tally of the cast-counts or their sums were kept with the grains by counting out, and that of the individual by moving the pointer of the passageway as many dots or grain-places to the left as the cast called for. If a player of the East or North overtook a player of the West or South, if his pointer fell in the same space, he maimed his opponent—sent him back to his passageway —and robbed him of his load; that is, took or made him forfeit his counts.
The completion of the fourth cireuit by any one of the players closes the ordinary game, providing the sum of the cosmical counts had been won by him, and the player who, with his partner, had the largest aggregate of both lot and cosmical counts was the winner.
There were many variants of this game as to counts. Some of these were so complicated that it was absolutely impossible for me to gain knowledge of them in the short practice I had in the play.. I have given here, not very precisely or fully, the simplest form I know, except that of the lot and diagram, which was quite like that of Ta sho'-li-we (or wood canes), which may be seen by the above description to be an obvious derivative both in mode and name of the older game of ‘‘canes.” It was evidently thus divorced for purposes of exoterie play, as it is practiced not only by men but also by women.

Fig. 112 represents the obverse of a set of Zuni canes for Sho’-li-we reproduced from memory by Mr. Cushing for the writer in the summer of 1893. It will be observed that the a/-thlu-a, the uppermost cane in fig. 112, corresponding with the north, is marked on the convex side with a cross, agreeing directly in this respect with one of the sticks in the Tewan game (fig. 88). This peculiarity, in one form or another, is repeated throughout almost the entire series of implements described, the obveise of one of the sticks in many of the sets being carved or burned, while in others one of the staves is tied about the middle. In attempting to account for this it occurred to the writer to compare the Zuni stick bearing the cross mark with an atlatl or throwing stick (fig. 113) from a Cliff dwelling in Maneos Canyon, Colorado, in the University of Pennsylvania Museum.
Mr. Cushing had already suggested to me that the a/-thlu-a, placed beneath the others in throwing corresponded with the atlatl. The comparison confirmed his suggestions. The cross mark is clearly the cross wrap-

ping of the atlatl (fig. 114) for the attachment of finger loops. In the opinion of the writer, the Zuni canes may be regarded as symbolic of the atlatl and three arrows, such as are seen carried by the gods in
Fig. 114. HANDLE OF ATLATL SHOWING CROSSED WRAPPING FOR ATTACHMENT OF FINGER LOOPS.

Mexican pictures. From the evidence afforded by the implements employed, the games with tossed canes, staves, ete., I conclude that they must all be referred to the region of cane arrows and the atlatl, probably Mexico and the southwestern United States.
A summary of the games described in the preceding pages is contained in the following tables. The games of this class L have found recorded as existing among some sixty-one tribes, comprised in twentythree linguistie stocks, described or collected by some seventy-five observers, extending trom the year 1634 down to the present, and represented by some ninety specimeus from forty-one tribes, eighteen stocks, and thirty-nine collectors in the five principal American museums of ethnology: Washington, New York, Chicago, Cambridge, and Philadelphia, and the hands of five individuals. The older accounts of the game among the Indians of Mexico are not included in this enumeration.

In the summer of 1896, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, while engaged in explorations for the BaReE of American KE Bini. gy, found several ancient split reeds marked in a similar manner to those used in the Zuni game of Sho/-li-we. These reeds, represented in plate 15, were dug up by him at the Cherlon ruin, near where the Cherlon Fork empties into the Little Colorado, about 15 miles east of Winslow, Arizona. He writes:
I have no means of knowing how old Cherlon ruin is, but very old—no white man’s objects were unearthed there. There were settlements in the vicinity as late as 1700, This may have been one, but I judge from the ruin and legends that it was much older. ‘The ruin of Cherion, like many on the banks of the Little Colorado, shows resemblances to ruins on Zuni River, and no doubt has relations with them. The Southern Hopi clans claim them, and I fancy both Zuni and Moki are related to the clans of Cakwabayi, ‘‘Blue Running Water House.”
I am indebted to Mr. Wells M. Sawyer, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, for the careful drawing (Plate 15) showing the marks on the reeds. One reed is apparently without marks on the exterior, and of the four others two have the same marks, from which the writer infers that they form part of at least two original sets. During the same

season’s work, Dr. Fewkes excavated a bowl (Cat. No. 157735, U.S.N.M.) from the old ruin of Cunopavi containing a symbolic pictograph of a bird, and a representation of the four reed or stave casts (Plate 16). This bowl was dug up from the old cemetery. Old Cuiopavi, or Shimopavi, as it is commonly written, he informs me, was inhabited in 1540, and the people moved to the present site about the end of the seventeenth century. ‘The bowl is of the same ware as the prehistoric pottery of Tusayan, and I think it older than 1540, but that is not proven. The bird is Kwataka, ‘Hagle Man,” an old crony of gamblers.” Additional evidence of the antiquity of the stave game in North America is afforded by a prehistoric stave of cotton wood (fig. 115), (Mus. Arch., Univ. Penn.), tied at one end with sinew to prevent its splitting, and practically identical with the Navajo staves of cotton wood (Cat. No. 9557, U.S.N.M.), which was found by the Wetherill Brothers in a prehistoric Cliff dwelling in Mancos Canyon, Colorado. In ancient Mexico, among the cultivated Aztecs, we fiud mention of the “game of the canes” under the names of cauallopan and nemimina-

liztli in Molina’s dictionary. Dr. Brinton informs me that the combination cauallopan nemiminaliztli is defined by R. Simeon, in his Dictionnaire de la langue Nauhuatl, as “playing with horses.” Again Molino gives neyayaotlaliztli—‘ juego de canas, 0 escaramuca” (skirmish) and juegos de pelea (war) ==neyayaotlaliztli.
A reference to the cane game is to be found in Torquemada,' Speaking of the ceremonies in honor of Tlaloc” he says:
The day on which they held feast to these gods was in the sixth month, which corresponds to our June, On this day they cleansed all cisterns and water conduits and played with green maize stalks.
Again, in the “ Hymn of Tlaloc”*® occurs the passage:
In Tlalocan, in the verdant house, they play at ball, they cast the reeds.
Duran‘ (somewhat confusedly) describes a game with tossed canes as follows:
There was another game, which was that they made on a plaster floor little hollows after the manner of a fortuna (wheel of fortune?), and one took ten pebbles and the other ten others, and the one placing his pebbles on the one edge and the other on the other on contrary sides, and taking some reeds split down the middle they threw them on the ground so that they sprang up, and as many reeds as fell with the hollow side upward so many ‘‘houses” he moved his pebbles forward, and thus one such followed the other, and all pebbles as he overtook, he went on taking away until he left his adversary without any.® (The meaning of the clause that follows is not clear. )
The game of Patolli (No. 39) by which we now generally understand the game played with marked beans instead of canes or staves, upon a cross Shaped diagram, is probably a derived form of the cane game, the use of beans being paralleled at the presentday among the Cherokee (see p. 720). The word was a general name for games and was also applied to the ‘‘ dice,” by which they were counted. Ribas uses it in that sense in the account which follows, referring to the Indians of Sinaloa:
The game that they call of the Patolli is very common among them and corresponds to that of cards or dice, because in place of them they use certain four small

When they play they throw these down, casting them upon a small stone in order that they may rebound and fall with their points at random, and he who plays wins or loses, marking on the earth the points which gain until the number is reached of the wager which those present have made. This wager is of beads of shells of the sea which they esteem and with which they adorn themselves.

In searching for remains of the cane game in old Mexico, the writer was deeply impressed with the many points of resemblance between the gaming circuit as described by Mr. Cushing as used in Sho’-li-we, and some of the diagrammatic paintings in the codices, leading him to the conclusion that the purpose of the latter was identical. As an illustration, the figure from the Féjérvary codex (Plate 17) may be regarded as a divinatory, calendrical counting circuit, the forty beans or corn of four colors of the Zuni Sho’ li-we having their counterparts in the four colored arms of the cross—red, yellow, blue, and green—marked with small circles. Again the entire design of the Mexican figure will be seen to represent an animal or the hide of an animal, comparable with the buffalo hide of the Zuni game. In the center of the Mexican

picture is a figure of a warrior god or priest, armed with atlatl and darts, corresponding to the cross, symbolic of the twin war god of the Zuni circuit. The scheme of the plate from Prof. Cyrus Thomas’s Notes on certain Maya and Mexican Manuscripts! is added (fig. 116) to facilitate comparison.
From South America the following sets of implements have been collected:

plain. The third stick is about 3{ inches in length, made of another wood, and possibly belongs to another set. Collected by Dr. Emil Hassler. Dr. Hassler informed the writer that they are tossed in the air and if three round sides fall uppermost they gain. ‘The sticks must fall parallel.”
Referring to the Toba, Cardus! says:
Their principal game consists in raising and letting fall to the ground some small pieces of split reed with much shouting; the object of the shouting, on one side, that the pieces may fall well, and on the other that they may fall badly. The stakes are usually a horse, a cow, a slave, a sheep, or a poncho.
Another set of similar gambling instruments from the Indians of the Grand Chaco are represented in fig. 118. They were exhibited by Dr. Hassler in his collection at the Columbian Exposition, but unfortunately can not now be found in the Field Columbian Museum, to which the collection was transferred. The two large bones are tossed, their falls determining the count, which is recorded by means of the small radial bones tbat are strung upon the cord. The men who play this game carry the implements suspended from their wrist.” The games above described led the writer to make a particularly careful

mac, for the University of Pennsylvania, now in its Museum, are a number of narrow, flat tablets of hard wood that might possibly have been used as gaming staves. The same conjecture might be hazarded with reference to six slips of cane (Cat. No. 28393) found together on a mummy in the first cemetery. These slips, which are 4 inches in length by about 4 inch in width, are wound with colored thread, black, yellow,
'Las Misiones Franciscanas entre los infideles de Bolivia por el R. P. Fr. José Cardus, Barcelona, 1886, p. 263.
*I find the following reference to games of this type among the South American Indians: Molina (History of Chili, II, p. 9), in describing the games of the Araucanians, says, ‘‘the game of quechu, which they esteem highly, has a great affinity to that of backgammon, but instead of dice they make use of triangular pieces of bone marked with points, which they throw with a little hoop or circle supported by two pegs, a8 was probably the fritillus of the ancient Romans.”

<<<Page: 1035>>>

and red, in bands of varying width. The arrangement of the colors varies on each of the six slips.
William Bollaert! describes a game of the Aymara Indians under the name of pasa.
It is one of great antiquity, and seems to be the only one of this sort. Pasa means a hundred, as he wins who first gets that number. They play it with two instruments, one a spread eagle of wood with ten holes on each side, being tens, and are marked with pegs to denote every man’s gettings; the other is a bone in the manner of a die, cut with seven faces, one of which has a particular mark called guayaro (huyaru). The other five tell according to the number of them, and the last isablank. The way ot playing is to toss up the bone, and the marks on the upper surface are so many got. But the guayro goes for ten, and the like number is lost if the blank side appears. ”
Von Tschudi* describes the following game:
Pitska, a game with small sticks which were marked with stripes of different colors. It was generally played during the night of the death watch. Villagomez believes that its name is derived from Pitska, the number ‘‘ five” because of the five fast days following the night of the death watch, a view which I do not accept. Holguin mentions the game Pitska, and refers to Pitskana as a six-sided piece of wood or small stick with which the game is played, only we do not know how it was done but probably in a similar way to the game of dice. In Aymara its name is also Phiska.

Board, staves,‘ and men. A game played upon a board divided into rows of squares, with pieces or men, which are moved according to the throws with four staves (fig. 119).
The board, called a seega (fig. 120), is divided into four rows of squares called beyts (houses) each about 2 inches wide, or it consists of similar rows of holes made in the ground or in a flat stone. The beyts are usually seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, or fifteen in each row. In each beyt of one exterior row is placed a little piece of stone or dingy brick about the size of a walnut, and in each beyt of the other exterior row a piece of red brick or tile, or sometimes eee are placed in only

Srefercine to the above account, Dr. Brinton tells me that the exact form, pasa, as a numeral, does not appear to prevail in Aymara or Quichua. In Aymara we have:
pad or paya = 2 or twice
pusi ==4
pataca =a) In Quichua:
pussac = 8
pachac = 100 “T do not find guayaro or huyaru in either tongue, although there are a number of words close to them.” *Zeitriige zur Kentniss des alten Peru, Wein, 1891, p. 217. *Cat. No. 16896, Mus. Arch., Univ. Penn. Made in Streets of Cairo, Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893.

a certain number of beyts in those rows, as for instance in the first four. The pieces of one row must be distinguished from those in the other.

ground or against a wall, or against a stick inclined against a wall. The throws count as follows: 1 white side up, called téb, or weled, “child” =1. 2 white sides up —— 3 white sides up = 4 white sides up = 4. 4 black sides up e—l(5e A throw of 4 or 6 entitles the player to throw again.!
The name of the board in this game, seega, appears to be an Arabacized form of the Indian word saj, “teak.” According to native lexicographers it is applied to wood, black and heavy and made in pieces of oblong form or squared, brought from India. In the sense of board it was originally applied to the tablet made of saj wood. The name given to the men, “dogs,” is the same as that applied to the men in the game of Kawade kelia (No. 37) in Ceylon. These facts would seem to

indicate an Asiatic origin for the game of Tab. According to Dr. Hyde it was known to the Persians under the name of Bazi kamish, that is, the ‘Reed game.”
The following game, No. 5, from Singapore, affords an illustration of its wide distribution in Asia:

small pieces, which, distinguished by certain marks, are thrown promiscuously upon a white garment. Then the priest of the canton, if the occasion be public (if private, the master of the family), after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and, as they come up, interprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them. If the result prove unfavorable, there is no more consultation upon the same affair that day; if propitious, a consultation by omens is still required.”
More closely resembling the practices described in the text is the German method of divination as related by Saxo-Grammaticus! of the inhabitants of the Isle of Rugen, in the Baltic Sea:
Throwing, by way of lots, three pieces of wood, white in one part and black in
another, into their laps, they foretold good fortune by the coming up of the white; bad by that of the black.

The reference in Herodotus? to divination among the Scythians, in which large bundles of rods were used, seems to refer to the class of divinatory rites that will be treated in the second part of this paper.
Lenormand®* states that the Magi foretold the future by throwing little sticks of tamarisk wood. The authority which he cites‘ makes no specific mention of any such performance, but merely says that the ‘Magi and Scythians prophesy with staves (ligno); and in many places prophesying they use twigs (virgis). Dinon says that the Median magi also prophesy by twigs (virga).” Dinon no doubt referred to the baresma, of which mention is also made by Strabo.°
The baresma (now called: barsom) was a bundle of sacred twigs which the priest held in his hands while reciting the prayers (Plate 18), They were formerly twigs of the pomegranate, date, or tamarind tree, or any tree that had no thorns, and were plucked with peculiar ceremonies which alone made them fit to be used for liturgic purposes.®

Lenormand declares that the baresma originated in a bundle of divining wands, such as were thrown in Chaldea and Babylonia. Madam Ragozin,' following the same line of comparison, points out the resemblance between the baresma (fig. 123) and a peculiar object (fig. 124) which frequently recurs deposited upon the altar in Assyrian scenes of worship and sacrifice. “The use of it, or the nature, has never yet been explained; but on close inspection it looks extremely like a bundle of twigs, uneven in number, tied together with aribbon. is it not likely that it may represent the sacred divining rods and be the original of the Avestan baresma ?”

In ancient’ China the nobles of the highest ranks carried scepters of jade stone,” the name of which, kicai, is written with a character, which compounded with the radical for “hand,” stands for kid, ‘to divine with straws,” No. 65; and again, with puk, “to divine,” written on the right, for the kwd or divinatory diagrams formed of unbroken and broken lines.’ These diagrams may be regarded as representing the permutations of two-faced staves, three producing the trigrams (fig. 5), Iam indebted to Prof. A. V. Williams Jackson, of Columbia University, for an opportunity to examine a set of baresma, presented to him with a set of sacrificial implements by Mr. Dinshah Pestanji Framji Ghadiali. They consist of a bundle of fortythree bright brass wires 5 inches in length (fig.122). In reply to my inquiry he writes that the number in this particular specimen is evidently a matter of chance, and he furnishes me with the following reference:
Haug’s Essays on the Parsis, p. 397 (third edition, by E. W. West), says:
‘The barsom consists of a number of slender rods or td7, formerly twigs of some particular trees, but now thin metal wires are generally used. The number of these tai depends upon the nature of the ceremony to be celebrated. For Ijashne (yazishn) alone 21 tdi are required; for Ijashne, with Vendidad and Visparad, 33 tav; for Yasht-i Rapithwin 13 ta; for Darin Baj 5 tai,.or 7 when a priest becomes a herbad.”

and six the hexagrams (fig. 4). These tablets, kwai, are figured in the imperial edition of the Chow Li, or “Ritual of the Chow Dynasty” (1122-255 B. C.), the pictures dating from the time of Chu Hi,’ by whom they were added to the text in the Twelfth Century, A. D. Among them is the wn kwai (fig. 125 A), the sun kwai (fig. 125 B), and the kung kwai (fig. 125 C).

The two pillars or columns were the emblems of the palace, supporting it in the same manner as the princes support the Emperor. Perhaps the name, vin kwai, indicates that these tablets had two columns.? The second, the ‘‘straight scepter,” was ;4, foot in length and carried by princes of the second rank (marquises).

figure of a man standing erect.' The third, the “bent scepter,” was also ;t, foot in length and was carried by princes of the third rank (earls). It is explained as probably representing the figure of a man bending over.!. The Emperor himself had a jade scepter, tdi kiwat (tig. 126), “grand tablet,” so called from its size, it being 3 feet in length.

It became smaller at the top and its head is in the shape of a hammer. This the Emperor wore between his robe and his girdle.’
In addition he held another scepter called the chan kwai or scepter of omnipotence (fig. 127). It was 1,2; feet in length. The word chan not only signifies omnipotence, but is also the name given to the four protecting mountains of the frontiers. In the picture added by Chu

Hi (fig. 127), one sees on the scepter of this name four masses of rock which represent the mountains.' From the explanation given by the commentator it would appear that the great scepter, tdi kwai, was wrapped with cords of five colors.
The kwai are not to be confounded with the tablets called fat (Japanese, shaku),? which were used at audiences in former times, nor with the scepters, ii ¢ (jii i; Japanese, niyov) given in China at marriage and to friends for good luck, and carried in Japan by certain priests® (fig. 130).
Among the Ainu, in Japan, the men use carved wooden staves to lift their mustache in drinking saké. These staves, which they call ikonit, are commonly known from their present use as “ mustache-sticks.” They are about 14 inches in length, flat on one side, and rounded upon the other, which is more or less elaborately carved.°
An examination of the twelve specimens in the U. 8. National Museum (Plates 19-22) shows a general resemblance to the staves which are tossed in gaming. The flat reverses are nearly all scratched with what were searcely discernible marks, represented in plates 20 and 22. The writer concludes that these “‘ mustache-sticks” were once emblems of rank or authority. .
The only existing objects of remote antiquity with which I am acquainted outside of America that might have been used as divinatory implements in the manner of the staves are a set of ivory rods, discovered by Prof. Flinders Petrie in Egypt, part of which are now in the Museum of Archeology of the University of Pennsylvania.
They constitute a portion of the find made by Professor Petrie in 1895

2Of the specimens illustrated fig. 128 represents a Chinese tablet scepter in the University Museum. It forms an accessory of a Chinese theatrical costume of a noble of the imperial court and is made of wood, painted brown and varnished, instead of ivory. This scepter is slightly bent, 20 inches in length, about ¢ inch thick, and tapers from 2 inches wide at the base to 12 inch at the top. The shaku (fig. 129) is from a tracing of one in the U. 8. National Museum, held in the hand of the statue of the Baron Li, said to have been one actually used by that illustrious man.
3 The ii ¢, literally ‘‘as you wish,” is of Buddhistic origin, and is one of the Sapta ratna or ‘‘Seven precious things,” which constitute the insignia of a Tchakravartti. In Japan it is carried by the chief priests of the Zen sect, and is used by them to administer a blow to the catechumen when he fails to answer correctly. Its origin presents an interesting problem, its form suggesting that of the throwing-stick. The fat or shaku are wooden tablets, said to have been originally used for noting memoranda.

between Ballas and Nagada, about 30 miles below Thebes, and attributed by him to a new race, probably Lybian, to whom he assigned a date about 3000 B. C. These rods or staves comprise part of a series from one tomb, “ possibly a game,” of which he gives the following list:
Twelve ivory rods, fig. 131.
Five ivory rods with incised diagonal lines, fig. 132.
Four figures of lions and one figure of hare, fig. 133. .
Seventeen blocks, of which thirteen are bone, two limestone, and two alabaster.
Thirty balls, natural irony concretions.
The twelve ivory rods, possibly intended for counting, are very perfect copies of jointed canes or straws. Four of the five rods with diagonal lines incised are in the University Museum. They are plain on one side, while the other is marked as shown in fig. 132, two having lines in diagonal bands of fours, and two a peculiar mark in the middle, which may have been intended to represent a feminine symbol]. I have been unable to learn that any representation of such a game has been identified upon the monuments.
In Africa, Bent! gives the following account of the use of the four staves in divination:
From many of the huts at Inyamanda were hanging their dollasses— wooden charms—on which are drawn strange figures (Plate 23). Each family possesses a set of four, tied together by a string. Of these four one always has a curious conventional form of a lizard carved on it; others have battle-axes, diamond patterns, ete., invariably repeating themselves, and the purport of which I was never able to ascertain. They are common among all the Abantu races, and closely bound up with their occult belief in witchcraft. They are chiefly made of wood, but sometimes neat little ones of bone are found, a set of which I afterwards obtained. On the evening of the new moon the village witch doctor will go

Dr. A. Donaldson Smith informs me that he saw a game played with staves throughout Somaliland and by the Sheik Hussein tribe among the Arusa Gallas.
‘Speaking of the natives of the Zambezi, the Livingstones (David and Charles Livingstone, Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambezi, London, 1865, p.51) say:
The dice doctor or diviner is an important member of the community being, consulted by Portuguese and natives alike. Part of his business is that of a detective, it being his duty to discover thieves. When goods are stolen he goes and looks at the place, casts his dice, and waits for a few days, and then, for a consideration, tells who is the thief.
Referring to the Guinea negroes, Bosman (William Bosman, A New and Accurate Description of the Coast of Guinea, translated in Pinkerton’s Voyages, London, 1814, KVL; p.399) says:
The second way of consulting their idols is by a sort of wild nuts, which they pretend to take up by guess and let fall again, after which they tell them, and form their predictions from the numbers falling even or odd.
Specimens of pierced cowrie shells used in fortune-telling from the Liberian exhibit at the Columbian Exposition are shown in fig. 134. These objects are now in the Philadelphia Commercial Museum.
The negroes of the French West Indies, according to Labat (Nouveau Voyage aux Isles de ’ Amerique, Paris, 1724, LV, p. 153), play a game with cowries. He says: The game which they play in their country, and which they have also carried to the islands, is a sort of game of dice. It is composed of four bouges or shells, which are used by them as money. They have a hole purposely made in the convex side, so that they will stand as easily on one side as on the other. They shake them up in their hand as one shakes dice and throw them on a table. If all the sides with holes in them fall uppermost, or the opposite sides of two fall in the same manner and two in the opposite way, the player wins; but if the number of the holes is odd, he loses.
In the Streets of Cairo at the Columbian Exposition was a family of Bishareen Soudanese, living near Assouan, on the Nile, whose head was a dervish belonging to a local order, who practiced soothsaying with cowries (Dr. Talcott Williams). This man threw several cowrie shells, and made his prediction from the manner in which they fell. The cowrie shells correspond with the staves referred to by Bent, and are possibly substitutes for staves, as the writer also infers may be the case with similar shells in the Hindu game of Pachisi, No. 38.

Mr. J. Edward Farnum tells me that among the natives of the Bosi River, about 150 miles from its mouth (19° south latitude, East Africa), the witch doctors throw crocodile scales in fortune telling. The objects used are the nuchal dermosseous plates, from behind the base of the skull. They are smoothed down and polished, and six or eight—always. an even number—are thrown. ‘To obtain a reply toa question demanding an answer of “yes” or “no,” the smooth side up will be considered

The questions put to the witch doctor, who accompanied my informant, were usually about shooting. In reference to the animal to be shot, the doctor would name one side of the bones “masculine” and the other “feminine.” According to the answer, a male or female

At the present day the Hottentot children cast lots by twigs—that is, if a thing is lost or a theft has been committed, they throw bits of stick and judge of the culprit, or of the direction wherein the lost property is to be found, by the arrangement of twigs, and among the Kaffirs bundles of sticks and assagais are employed by diviners in their rites for the discovery of crime.!
Referring to the Melanesians, Codrington’ says:
A game which belongs to the Banks Islands and New Hebrides is tika, the Fiji tiqua, played with reeds dashed in such a manner upon the ground that they rise in the air and fly to a considerable distance. In some islands, as Santa Maria, a string is used to give impetus, and in some the reed is thrown also from the foot. The game is played by two parties, who count pigs for the farthest casts, the number of pigs counted as gained depending on the number of knots in the winning tika. When two villages engage in a match, they sometimes come to blows. There are marks on the tika to show to whom they belonged. Itis remarkable that in Mota a decimal set of numerals is used in this game, distinct from the quinary set used on every other occasion of counting.
In New Zealand, according to Taylor,’ the natives had a way of divination by means of sticks. This was called Niu.' Each chief had a_ particular name for his own stick; thus, that of one chief was called Te ata mounu; that of another, Te manu i te ra; and that of a

so that no one should have been out before him, which would destroy the power of consultation, and taking his stick, a short, thin one made of the mahoe, in his right hand, and another representing the enemy in his left, he went and stuck another in the ground; this represented the tapu; and placing the two sticks together, one across the other, he uttered a harakia, and then threw them in front of a third stick, and it was according to their position that the consulter ascertained whether anyone was traveling on

the road, whether they are friends or foes, and, if the latter, whether they would be conquered or not.!
Different tribes had different ways of consulting the Niu, but the practice was general throughout the land. A spirit called Korohaha Tu was supposed to reside in the stick.?
This manner of divination finds an almost exact parallel in that described by Marco Polo as being resorted to by Chinghis Kaan. *
So when the two great hosts were pitched on the plains of Tanduec as you have heard, Chinghis Kaan one day summoned before him his astrologers, both Christians and Saracens, and desired them to let him know which of the two hosts would gain the battle—his own or Prester John’s. The Saracens tried to ascertain, but were unable to give a true answer; the Christians, however, did give a true answer, and showed manifestly beforehand how the event should be. For they got a cane and split it lengthwise, and laid one-half on this side and one-half on that, allowing no one to touch the pieces. And one piece of cane they called Chinghis Kaan and the other piece they called Prester John. And then they said to Chinghis: ‘Now mark; and you will see the event of the battle, and who shall have the best of it; for whose cane soever shall get above the other, to him the victory shall be.’ ‘Then the Christian astrologers read a Psalm out of the Psalter, and went through other incantations. And lo! whilst all were beholding, the cane that bore the name of Chinghis Kaan, without being touched by anybody, advanced to the other that bore the name of Prester Johu and got on top of it.
Colonel Yule has collected a number of references to similar divinatory processes, of which the following appear to belong to the same class:
The words of Hosea (iv, 12), ‘My people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them,’ are thus explained by Theophylactus: ‘They stuck up a couple of sticks, whilst murmuring certain charms and incantations; the sticks then, by the operation of devils, direct or indirect, would fall over, and the direction of their fall was noted,’ etc. Rubruquis seems to have witnessed nearly the same process that Polo describes. Visiting Lady Kuktai, a Christian queen of Mangu Kaan, who was ill, he says: ‘The Nestorians were repeating certain verses, I know not what (they said it was part of a Psalm), over two twigs which were brought into contact in the hands of two men. The monk stood during the operation.’ Petis de la Croix quotes from Thévenot’s travels a similar mode of divination as much used, before a fight, among the Barbary corsairs. ‘Two men sit on the deck facing one another, and each holding two arrows by the points, and hitching the notches of each pair of arrows into the other pair. Then the ship’s writer reads a certain Arabic formula, and it is pretended that, whilst this goes on the two sets of arrows, of which one represents the Turks and the other the Christians, struggle together in spite of the resistance of the holders, and finally one rises over the
‘If the stick representing his tribe fell above the other, it was a favorable sign; if below, a bad one.
2 The following parallel custom exists among the Tsuishikari Ainu, as described to J. M. Dixon in the work cited: ‘‘A man in the tribe, desirous to know the will of the Deity regarding a certain matter, called in the aid of the tusuguru (magiciandoctor). He came at night with two fresh willow (susw) wands, stripped of the bark, which he placed on a mat by the hearth. Then he called upon the unjika-mui (Fire-god) to declare his will. Soon the footsteps of the god were heard; they caine up to the side of the tusuguru; the wands showed signs of restlessness and struck the mat on which they were placed. Two raps signified permission; a scraping or rubbing was an unfavorable augury.”
’Colonel Henry Yule, The Book of Ser Marco Polo, London, 1871, I, p. 213.

<<<Page: 1061>>>

other. P. Della Valle (II, 865-866) describes the same process, conducted by a Mohammedan conjuror of Aleppo: ‘ By his incantations he made the four points of the arrows come together without any movement of the holders, and by the way the points spontaneously placed themselves, obtained answers to interrogatories.’ And Mr. Jaeshke writes from Lahaul: ‘There are many different ways of divination practiced among the Buddhists; and that also mentioned by Marco Polo is known to our Lama, but in a slightly different way, making use of two arrows, instead of a cane split up, wherefore this kind is called da-mo (arrow divination).’ Indeed, the practice is not extinct in India, for in 1833 Mr. Vigne (I, 46) witnessed its application to detect the robber of a government chest at Lodiana.
It will be observed that in three of the examples the sticks or twigs are replaced by arrows.

In concluding this examination, reference should be made to the suggestion by Col. Garrick Mallery! that the colored pebbles found in the grotto of Mas d’Azil, in the department of Ariége, France, were used in gaming.
Only one face of these pebbles bears a design (fig. 135). Colonel Mallery Says:
To an observer familiar with the gambling games of the North American Indians, in which marked plum-stones and similar objects are employed, these stained flat pebbles at once suggest their use to suggest values in a game by the several designs and by the pebbles falling on the figured or on the unmarked side.2

which are written the names of places throughout Korea famous for beauty of scenery.! Still another Korean game (Cat. No. 17628) of this typein the University Museum is known as the *“‘ Monk’s tjyong-kyeng-to,”
and is intended for the purpose of giving instruction in the religion of Buddhism. The sheet, which measures about 12 inches square, is inscribed with a diagram, the inner part of which is divided into one hundred and sixty-nine squares (13 by 13). These contain the names of the various conditions of existence, advancing from the lowest forms through the eighteen Brahmalokas, to the goal, which is Nirvana.
It is, in fact, a Buddhist game of Promotion. The moves are made according to the throws with three small wooden lice (fig. 138), each inscribed on its six sides with the magic formula: Nam mo o ni to fat (Namah Amitabha). Under each name is written the place of the next move, according to the throw. The name at the top of the sheet is in Sanskrit

It is divided into squares, of which those in the upper corners, left and right, bear, respectively, pictures .of the Bodhisattva Manjusri, and the sword of wisdom, the emblem of his knowledge. Of the remaining sixty squares onehalf are inscribed with religious emblems and the others, placed immediately beneath, with Tibetan words which in greater part were illegible.

9, LonG LAWRENCE.’ Wooden die (fig. 141). Almondbury, England.
Reproduction from description given by Mrs. Gomme.’ This die is described in Easther’s Almondbury Glossary, quoted by Mrs. Gomme, under the name of Lang Lawrence, that is ‘Long Lawrence,” as an instrument marked with signs, a sort of teetotum.
A “Long Lawrence” is about three inches long, something like a short ruler with eight sides; occasionally they have but four. On one side are ten X’s or crosses, forming a kind of latticework; on the next to the left, three double cuts or strokes, passing straight across in the direction of the breadth; on the third a zig zag of three strokes one way and two or three the other, forming a W, with an additional stroke or triple V; on the fourth, three single bars, one at each end and one in the middle, as in No. 2, where they are doubled; then the four devices are repeated in the same order. The game, formerly popular at Christmas, can be played by any number of persons. Each has a bank of pins or other small matters. A pool is formed: then in turn each rolls the ‘ ene Lawrence.” If No. 1 comes up the player cries “‘flush,” and takes the pool; if No. 2, he puts down two pins; if No. 3, he says “‘lave all,” and neither takes nor gives; ie No. 4, he picks up one. The sides are considered to bear the names “lush,” ‘Put doan ‘Ewo.? “Lave all,” “Sam up one.” It has been suggested that the name ‘ Lawrence” may have arisen from the marks scored on the instrument, not unlike the bars of a gridiron on which the saint perished.

°On the Hradischt near Stradonitz in Bohemia, which is referred to La Téne period, several hundred longish stick-dice, marked with .concentric circles (dice eyes), were found (fig. 147). Of the four longer faces, two opposite ones are broader than the two others. The ends are plain, while the long sides are marked three, four, five, six, so that the broader faces have three, four, and the narrower ones five, six. (Osborne in Mitteil. des Anthropol. Ges., Wien, X, p. 255, quoted from Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche, Richard Andree, Leipzig, 1889, II, p. 104). In commenting upon the above find, Osborne states that in North German, Holstein, and Danish finds these stick-dice also appear. These latter are similar to those of Hradischt, but are to be distinguished from them, however, by the markings, as they mostly only have the spots on the three long sides (with the numbers three, four, and six), leaving the fourth side unmarked. He continues that, after numerous inquiries (in Germany, Holstein, Denmark, and Switzerland), if at any other place entirely similar dice to those found in the Hradischt had been discovered, he received

14. ASTRAGALI (TALI). Knuckle bones.'. Natural bones from the ankle of a sheep. ‘
Used as dice by the Greeks and Romans, and in common use at the present day for the same purpose in the Mohammedan East and in Southern Europe and Spanish America.
Knuckle bones have been used as implements in games from remote antiquity. There are several distinct ways in which they are thus employed. One was as jackstones, described by classical authors as

Greeks and Romans numerical values were attributed to the four long sides, the two pointed ends not being counted. The two broad sides, respectively convex and concave, counted three and four, while of the narrow sides, the flat counted one and the indented six. The numbers two and five were wanting.!
Several names, both Greek and Latin, are recorded for each of the throws.
Two persons played together at this game, using four bones, which they threw into the air, or emptied out of a dicebox ( fritillus). The numbers on the four sides of the four bones admitted of thirty-five different combinations. The lowest throw of all was four aces, but the value of a throw was not in all cases the sum of the

four numbers turned up. The highest in value was that called Venus, in which the numbers cast up were all different. Certain other throws were called by particular names, taken from gods, illustrious men and women, and heroes. These bones, marked and thrown as above described, were also used in divination.!
Among the Turks, Arabs, Persians, the four throws with a single knuckle bone receive the names of the four ranks of human society. Thus, among the Persians, according to Dr. Hyde, they were called as follows:
Supinum, Dudz, ‘‘ thief.” Pronum, Dihban, ‘‘ peasant.” Planum, Vezir.
Tortuosum, Shah.

The Arabic name for the bones is kdb (dual, kdbatain, plural, kabat), meaning “ankle,” referring to their source. Two bones are now commonly used—one from the right and the other from the left leg of a Sheep.' [regard them as the direct ancestors of cubical dotted dice, the name of which in Arabic is the same as that of the bones. The dice used in Arabic countries are made in pairs (see No. 16), and the most popular and universal game is one with two dice, kdbatain.
Fig. 148.
Tarahumara Indians, Chihuahua, Mexico.
Games with knuckle bones are a favorite amusement in SpanishAmerican countries, and it is claimed that they existed among the Indians before the discovery. Dr. Carl Lumholtz found them among the Tarahumara,’ who attribute numerical values to the different sides.
Among the Papago in Arizona Mr. W J MeGee found a single knuckle bone of a bison, used in playing a game called Tan-wan, of which a specimen collected by him (fig. 149,) is exhibited in the U.S. National Museum (Cat. No. 174443).
The favorite game among the Turkomans, according to Vémbéry (Arminius Vémbéry, Sketches of Central Asia, Philadelphia, 1868, p. 110), is the Ashik game (ashik, the ankle bones of sheep), which is played in the manner of European-dice with the four ankle bones of a sheep, and with a degree of passionate excitement of which one can form no idea, The upper part of the bone is called tara, the lower altchi, and the two sides yantarap. The player takes these four little bones into the palm of his hand, throws them up and receives half the stake, if two tava or two altchi, and the whole of the stake, if all four tava or altchi turn up.
The advantage to be gained arises entirely from dexterity in throwing. Trickery is impossible, since the bones are frequently changed.
Dr. Karl Himly (Die abteilung der Spiele in Spiegel der mandschu-sprache, T’oung Pao, VI, p. 355) gives the Manchu name of knuckle bone as gaéura. It would appear from his account that several games were known corresponding to those described by the author as played by Syrian children. One, played by children, in which the bones were employed as jackstones; another in which they were used as dice, and a third filliping a knuckle bone at something or throwing at a knuckle bone set in the ground. ‘The Chinese name of knuckle bone is piii shik kwat (pei si ku).
? They call the game Tu wi tui wa la. They play with two knuckle bones. The counts are shown in fig. 148. In addition to these counts, if a bone stands on its pointed end it counts six, and on the end opposite, twelve.
Twelve points constitute a game. The specimens collected by Dr. Lumholtz are in the American Museum of Natural History (Cat. No. s33;).

<<<Page: 1075>>>

The game is played by two persons, who sit facing each other, 4 or 5 feet apart. The bone is twirled into the air out of the thumb and forefinger, the back of the hand being held upward. The position in which it falls on the ground controls the count in the game. So long as the player succeeds in throwing the pitted side, or ‘‘cow-hoof,” as it is called, upward, he retains possession of the bone, and with each throw wins one bean trom a prearranged number equally divided between the players. The sides do not count in the play, and the thrower may play again and again without forfeiting the bone until he throws the flat side (opposite the ‘‘ cow-hoof”) upward, when the bone goes to his opponent to throw, with the same Eh conditions.

In Costa Riea, Dr. T. M. Calnek informs Cat, No. 17443, U.S.N:M. me that the Indians in the vicinity of San José continually play with the astragalus of an ox or cow, using a single bone. They call the game by the name of Choque suelo.
They are also used by the Indians in Peru. Their Quichua name, tava, would appear to be derived from the Spanish taba, but this is contrary to the opinion entertained by my informant, Dr. Emilio Montez,! who exhibited a prehistoric copy of a knuckle bone in terra cotta, from Cuzco, in his collection at the Columbian Exposition.’

Knuckle bones of various animals, some worked and showing wear, have been found associated with Indian remains in various parts of the United States. Mr. Clarence B.

Bryan County, Georgia. Mr. William W. Adams found knuckle bones in stone graves opened by him in Williamson County, Tennessee. Thirty or forty bones were found in perhaps a hundred graves. They were always found in pots. Children’s graves contained smaller pots, and the bone was smaller, evidently from a small animal. Some were worn until nearly smooth on the side, and all showed polish as though they had been carried or used a long time. A number of specimens from mounds are contained in the U.S. National Museum, as Cat. No. 63047, astragalus of bison from a mound, Pecan Point, Mississippi County, Arkansas, and Cat. No. 63047a, astragalus of deer from same place, both collected by Mr. Edward Palmer. Three specimens (Cat. No. 61621) are from Lyons County, Kentucky; two others (Cat. No. 91145) catalogued from Arkansas, are respectively of deer and bison; another (Cat. No. 169518) is from Lepanto, Poinsett County, Arkansas. Some of these bones are squared, so as to have six instead of four sides, many are more or less cut down, and oneis partly calcined. Mr. Cushing found a number of knuckle bones of deer, several showing high polish from long use, in the muck deposit explored by him at Marco, Florida,
In England knuckle bones were formerly used in games.! A single bone was tossed and the four sides received, according to Dr. Hyde, the tollowing names :?
Supinum, “ Put in.” Pronum, ‘ Blank.”
Planum, “ Take half.” Tortuosum, ‘‘ Take all.”
These terms sufficiently explain the method of play.
1 De Ludis Orientalibus, p. 142.
2 Under the head of Cockall, Brand (Observation on Popular Antiquities, London, 1813, II, p. 288) gives the following account:
In the Englisk translation of Levinus Lemnius, fol. London, 1658, p. 368, we read:
“The antients used to play Cockall or casting of huckle bones, which is done with smooth sheep bones. The Dutch call them Pickelen, wherewith our young maids that are not yet ripe use to play for a husband, and young married folks despise these as soon as they are married. But young men use to contend with another with a kind of a bone taken forth of oxe-feet. The Dutch call them Coten, and they play with these at a set time of the year. Moreover Cockals, which the Dutch call Teelings, are different from dice, for they are square with four sides, and dice have six. Cockals are used by maids amongst us, and do no ways waste any one’s estate. For either they pass away the time with them, or if they have time to be idle they play for some small matter, as for chestnuts, filberds, pins, buttons, and some such ‘juncats.’
“In Langley’s Abridgment of Polydor Vergile, fol. 1, we have another description of this game: ‘There is a game that is played with the posterne bone in the hynder foote of a sheepe, oxe, gote, fallowe, or redde dere, whiche in Latin is called Talus. It hath foure chaunces, the ace point, that is named Canis, or, Canicula, was one of the sides. He that cast it leyed doune a peny or so muche as the gamers were agreed on; the other side was called Venus, that signifieth seven. He that cast the echaunce won sixe and all that was layd doune for the castyng of Canis. The two other sides were called Chius and Senio. He that did throwe Chius wan three. And he that cast Senio gained four. This game (as I take it) is used of children in Northfolke, and

It is said that no traces of cubical dotted dice have been discovered in Egyptin the purely Egyptian period, but they occur in the Delta from the time of Psammetichus I (about 670 B. C.). They are regarded by scholars as a foreign introduction.
In the British museum there are two dice of glazed baked clay from Assyria, found with tablets of Assurbanipal (668-623 B.C.) at Kouyunjik.
As the glaze of the dice is unlike that of Assyrian pottery, and from the fact that the mounds at Ninevah were occupied by a Parthian village about 200 B. C., Mr. Pinches concluded that the dice proba-

18. TESSERAE.' Dice, Ancient Roman or Etruscan. Purchased in Florence, Italy.
Cubes of bone,? about an inch square, regularly marked, the pips consisting of concentric circles. As is frequently the case with Roman dice, these dice are made of a hollow bone, the openings on two opposite miles being stopped with bone plugs. Several of the Roman dice in the ‘University Museum are stained a greenish color with salts of copper.
Three tesserae or cubical dice were anciently employed, while four tali or knuckle bones were used. It is recorded, however, that as early as the time of Kustathius the modern practice of using two dice instead of three had been established.’
In order to prevent cheating, dice were cast into conical beakers (pyrgus, turricula), the interior of which was formed of different steps. A parallel to this is found in the Siamese backgammon, Saka, where the dice are thrown into the krabok.
The classical games with dice, of which accounts have come down to us, were chiefly played in connection with a board or table (abacus, tabula, alveus, alveolus), on which pieces or men were moved according to the throws. These pieces were round or oval stones (calculi), or later, draftsmen (latrunculi), just, as with us, the same men are used for draughts and backgammon.
Professor Lanciani’ states that the one hundred and more gaming-
tables (tabulae lusoria) found in Rome, mostly during his lifetime, belong to six different games of hazard. In some of them, the mere chance of dice-throwing was coupled with a certain amount of skill in moving the ‘*‘men” or tesserae. Their outline is always the same. There are horizontal lines at equal distance, each line containing twelve signs, ~ thirty-six in all. The signs vary in almost every table; there are
circles, squares, vertical bars, leaves, letters, nonograms, crosses, crescents, and immodest symbols; the majority of these tables (sixty-five)

contain words arranged so as to make a full sentence with thirty-six letters. The rules of the games played upon these tables are as yet only conjectural. |
The game of Duodecim scripta, “twelve lines,” was substantially the same as our backgammon. It was played upon a board with twelve double lines, with fifteen white and fifteen black men; the throws were counted as we count them; the “blots” might be captured; the pieces (whether they started from home or not) had to be brought home, and the winner was he who first cleared off his men. The principal variation from the modern game lies in three dice being employed instead of two, agreeing in this respect with the game of Pachisi (No. 38). According to Heroditus! games with dice (including also knucklebones and ball) were invented by the Lydians as a diversion during a time of famine, that they might not feel the craving for food.
19. SHix Tsar? Dice. China.
Cubes of bone, regularly marked, but differing from those of India in having both the “ones” and “fours” marked in red; the ‘‘one” spots larger than the others, and in all the spots being simple round marks, without circumscribed circles. They are not made in pairs, and are usually sold in sets of six.
The Chinese play a great variety of dice-games, the principal one being with two dice, and known as Chdk ? inkau, “Throwing Heavens and Nines,” from the names of the two highest throws. In this game the twenty-one throws that can be made with two dice receive different names, and are divided into two series or suites, called man, “civil,” and mo, “military.” 7
The eleven Man throws in the order of their rank are:
““Double six,” called Vin, ‘‘ Heaven.”
“Double one,” called ti, ‘‘ Earth.”
“Double four,” called yan, ‘ Man.”
‘One, three,” called wo, ‘‘ Harmony.”
“‘Double five,” called mii, “plum flower.”
“Double three,” called chéung sdém, ‘‘long threes.”
“Double two,” called pan tang, “bench.”
“Five, six,” called fu tau, ‘‘tiger’s head.”
“Four, six,” called hung Vau shap, ‘‘red head ten.”
“One, six,” called kd kéuk ts’at, “long leg seven.”
“One, five,” called hung ch’ui luk, ‘red mallet six.” The ten Mo throws in the order of their rank are:
“Five, four,” and ‘six, three,” called kau, “nines.”
“Vive, three,” and “six, two,” called pdt, ‘‘eights.”
“‘Bive, two,” and ‘‘four, three,” called ts’at, ‘‘sevens.”
“‘Four, two,” called luk, “six.”
“Three, two,” and ‘‘four, one,” called ’ng, “fives.”
“‘One, two,” called sdm, ‘‘three,” or scm kai, ‘‘three final.”

The antiquity of dice in China is not known. They appear to have been introduced into that country from India. It will be observed that a cosmical significance is attached to the dice throws, the “six” being called “Heaven,” and its opposite, “one,” “Earth.” The “four” between is designated as ‘ Man.” !
Korean dice, called tjyou-sd-d, differ from those of China in having the 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 opposite. A set in the University Museum, collected by Dr. E. B. Landis, are marked with plain black dots, arranged like the Hindu kdbatain, to form a pair. A single Korean die (fig. 152), in the same museum, is a rectangular prism, flat instead of square. The arrangement of the dots is the same, but the “one” and the “ four” is in red, as well as the two middle spots of the ' ¢six” and the middle spot of the “ five” and of the “‘ three.”
It is interesting to note that the arrangement of the dots on the Korean dice is the same as that on some of the Etruscan dice.?, A peculiar importance is attached to the latter, from the fact that it is believed by Etruscologists that the first six numerals of the Etruscan language have been recovered from a pair of dice exhumed KOREAN DIE. in 1848 near Toscanella.? These dice, now in Cet pete ee the Cabinet of Medals and Antiques in the National Library, Paris, bear, instead of the usual pips or dots, the following words in Etruscan letters: Mach, Thu, Huth, Ki, Zal, Sa. These words have been variously interpreted by scholars upon the assumption that they are numerals, and also that the pips which they are supposed to replace were uniformly arranged 1+ 3, 2+ 4, 5+ 6 (Campanari’s law). Comparison of the Etruscan dice words with the numerals used in the Korean game of Nyout, a comparison suggested by the fact of the agreement of the Korean and Etruscan dice in their dissimilarity from other dice, shows a curious correspondence.

? Among the dice in the British Museum regarded as Etruscan, which vary in their pips from the regular arrangement (that is, 1+ 6, 2+ 5, 3-+ 4), three have 1 + 2, 3+ 4, 5+6, and three 143, 2+4,5-+6. What appears to be a set of three dice, made of amber, have one marked 1+ 2, 3+ 4, 5+ 6; one1+3, 244, 5+ 6, and one regular, 1+ 6, 2+5, 3+4. Two iron dice (Cat. No. 15786) in the University Museum, purchased at Perugia, have their dots arranged 1+ 3, 2+ 4, 5+ 6.

From the fact of the nyout numerals being in all probability derived from an Ural-Altaic stock, their correspondence with the dice words would seem to support Canon Isaae Taylor’s'theory of the Ugric origin of the Etruscans. Itshould be observed, however, that if the words stand for numerals they are not paired? in either of the ways (1 + 3, 2+ 4, 5+ 6, or 1+2, 344, 5+ 6) in which Etruscan dice are marked.’ The doubt as to their being numerals is reinforced by the Korean die inscribed with the prayer to Buddha (p. 821).
20. SAI. Dice,* Japan. Pair of plaster dice for Sugoroku (No. 28). Japanese dice are similar to those of China, from which country they were doubtless borrowed. The “fours” are sometimes, but not invariably,markedinred. The most popular game is Sugoroku (No. 28). Before leaving the subject of dice it may be observed that cubical dotted dice do not appear to have been known to the American tribes before the time of the conquest. At the same time mention should be made of a die of steatite found Fig. 153. with Indian remains at ETRUSCAN TRIPLICATE DIE. Kiokee Creek, Columbia County, Georgia, in the collection of Dr. Roland Steiner, in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 172563). It consists of a rudely cut square prism of steatite about { inch in length. Two of the opposite longer sides are marked with six and four pits and two with five and three. One of the ends has two and the other what is doubtless intended for one dot. The pips are irregularly disposed. It no doubt dates from the time of white contact.

‘Since the above was written the writer has acquired an Etruscan triplicate bone die (fig. 153) found in Chiusi or its vicinity, on which the dots are arranged differently from any thus far noticed by him. The 6 is here opposite the 4, and 5 opposite 3. One of the ends is marked 1 and the other 2. The spots are marked with small dotted circles which retain traces of red paint. It has been suggested that these triplicate dice, which are not infrequent, are unfinished and have yet to be sawed apart. It is evident from this specimen that such is not the case. They bear a strong general resemblance to the Ramala pdsd, or dice used in fortune-telling, among which we find three cubical dice united by a metal bar, and again, in another variety used in India, the same arrangement of spots: 3, 4, 5,60n a long die.

21. Kwat P’Ar.' “Bone tablets,” dominoes. Canton, China.
Set of thirty-two domino pieces of teak wood 23 inches by 7 inch by Zinch. Natural wood, with incised spots painted white and red.
Chinese dominoes are marked in the same manner as the dice, from which they are clearly derived. There are twenty-one distinct pieces, representing the permutations of two dice. Eleven of these pieces are doubled, making a total of thirty-two in the set. Each piece received a name, and in the popular game of Td Vin kau, or “Heavens and Nines,” the thirty-two pieces are divided into two suites or series, called Man, “civil,” and Mo, “military,”
The Man pieces are as follows:
&, called tin, ‘‘Heaven.” 1, called ti, “‘Earth.” 4, called yan, ‘‘Man.” 4, called wo, ‘‘Harmony.” 5, called mit, ‘‘plum flower.” 3, called chéung sam, ‘‘long threes.” %, called pan tang, ‘ bench.” £, called fu tau, ‘‘tiger’s head.” §, called hung Vaw shap, ‘‘red-head ten.” {, called ko kéuk ts’at, ‘‘ long-leg seven.” *, called hung ch’ui luk, ‘‘red-mallet six.” Each of the above pieces is duplicated, the duplicates mating. The Mo pieces: + and 3, called cht tsiin, ‘‘supreme.” § and 4, called tsdp kau, ‘‘ heterogeneous nines.” $ and 4, called tsdp pat, ‘‘ heterogeneous eights.” $ and 3, called tsdp ts’at, ‘“heterogeneous sevens.” 4 and 3, called tsdp ’ng, ‘‘ heterogeneous fives.”
They mate as above. The two pieces called ché tstin, or “supreme,” when paired rank as the highest of the Mo series, but when apart, as the lowest.
The game of Ta ?in kau is in manv respects the most interesting Chinese domino game. It somewhat resembles the card games of Europe, and is of considerable antiquity in China, existing, according to Mr. Wilkinson,’ in 1120 A. D.
The invention of the game of dominoes has been variously attributed to the Jews, the Greeks, and the Chinese. It may be justly credited to the latter people. No date can be assigned to its invention, and from the cosmical associations of the pieces, and their use in divination, which continues in China to the present day, it may be regarded as having been originally used for that purpose. That dominoes originated in dice is clearly apparent, the chief problem being the reason for the duplication of the eleven pieces. With the knowledge derived from the study of games in general, this may be assumed to have been done

in order that the dice throws might accord with the thirty-two points that represent the Four Quarters and the intermediary divisions of the world. They may be looked uponas having been implements of magic for determining number and place, corresponding with playing cards, from which they only differ in material, as Mr. Wilkinson has suggested.!
In addition to the long wooden dominoes, small dominoes, made of bamboo, or bone, or wood and bone conjoined like those of Korea, are used in various parts of China. Sets in which the series is several times duplicated also occur in China, as well as dominoes on which the dots are replaced by the characters that stand for the chess pieces, and the suit marks of certain Chinese playing-cards.”

'The writer is inclined to believe that in the assignment of the dice casts to the thirty-two points, they were first practically applied to as many divining slips or arrow lots, consisting of long, narrow strips of bamboo. Such objects occur at the present day in the sogealled chit p’di, or “leaping tablets,” of which a set from Fuhchau exists in the Museum of the Long Island Historical Society. They consist of thirty-two slips of bamboo, about 14 inches in length, with domino spots marked at one end, contained in a cylindrical bamboo box from which they are thrown, resembling the Ts’im ii (No. 69).

These cards are designated by the collector, Mr. W. H. Wilkinson, as Pat Vin kau from their being used in the game of T’in kau. Several varieties of domino cards occur in China, The evolution of playing cards from dice through the wooden domino seems at first sight to be clearly apparent, but the true ancestor of the playing card is doubtless found in the arrow, as shown under Korean playing cards.

Korean dominoes consist of small bone or ivory tablets, or of bone and wood conjoined like those exhibited. The set consists of thirtytwo pieces, identical with those of China. They receive different names, however, and are mated differently from the Chinese. The names are as follows: 1-1, syo-syo (Chinese, siz sit), “smallest.” 1-2, tjoui-hko (Chinese, shii pt), ‘‘rat nose.” 1-3, syo-sam (Chinese, siz sdm), ‘‘small and three.” 1-4, paik sa (Chinese, pak sz’), ‘‘ white and four.” 1-5, pdik-i (Chinese, pak ’ng), ‘“white and five.” 1-6, pdik-ryouk (Chinese, pak luk), ‘‘ white and six.” 2-2, tjoun-a (Chinese, tsun a), ‘‘superior two.” 2-3, a-sam (Chinese, d sam), ‘‘two and three.” 2-4, a-sé (Chinese, d sz’), ‘two and four.” 2-5, koan-a (Chinese, kun a), ‘‘sovereign two.” 2-6, a-ryouk (Chinese, @ luk), “two and six.” 3-3, tiyang-sam (Chinese, ch’éung sdm), ‘‘long three.” 3-4, sam-sdé (Chinese, sdm sz’), ‘‘three and four.” 3-5, sam-o (Chinese, sdm ’ng), ‘‘three and five.” 3-6, sam-ryouk (Chinese, sdm luk), three and six.” 4-4, tjoun-hong (Chinese, tsun hung), ‘‘superior red.” 4-5, sd-o (Chinese, sz’ ’ngq), ‘four and five.” 4-6, sd-ryouk (Chinese, sz’ lwk), ‘‘four and six.” 5-5, tjown-o (Chinese, tsun ’ng), ‘‘superior five.” 5-6, o-ryouk (Chinese, ’ng luk), “five and six.” 6-6, tjown-ryouk (Chinese, tsun luk), ‘superior six.”
The method of pairing is shown in fig. 155. The Korean games differ from those of China, the most popular, called Ho-hpai, “Foreign or Chinese Tablets,” having many points of resemblance to the Chinese system of fortune-telling in which dominoes are used (See Chinese Games with Dice and Dominoes). Korean dominoes are clearly of Chinese origin.

The game seems to date from a recent period in Europe. According to Brockhaus’ Conversations-Lexikon, Article “Domino,” it was introduced into Germany through France from Italy about the middle of the last century. In England it appears, from a writer in Notes and Queries, to have been introduced by French prisoners about the close of the last century.

26. DomINoES.! Eskimo. Labrador, North America.
Flat pieces of ivory, cut in irregular shapes, marked on one face with spots arranged in different patterns. The number of pieces in a set varies from sixty to one hundred and forty-eight. |
According to Mr. Lucien M. Turner, by whom they, were collected, the game is played in the following manner:
Two or more persons, according to the number of pieces in the set, sit down and pile the pieces before them. One of the players mixes the pieces together in plain view of the others. When this is done, he calls them to take the pieces. Each person endeavors to obtain a half or third of the number, if there be two or three players. The one who mixed up the pieces lays down a piece and calls his opponent to match it with a piece having a similar design. If this can not be done by any of the players, the first has to match it, and the game continues until one of the players has exhausted all of the pieces taken by him. The pieces are designed in pairs, having names such as ka mti tik (sled), kaiak (canoe), kalé sak (navel), dma zut (many), a tat sik (1), md kok (2), ping a sut (3), si ta mit (4), and td li mat (5). Each of the names above must be matched with a piece of similar kind, although the other end of the piece may be of a different design. A kamutik may be matched with an amazut, if the latter has not a line or bar cut across it; if it has a bar, it must be matched with an amazut.
This game is known to the people of the Ungava district, but those only who learn it fiom Northerners are able to play it. The northern Eskimo stake the last article they possess on the issue of the game. Their wives are disposed of temporarily, and often are totally relinquished to the victor. I have heard of wives so disposed of often sit down and win themselves back to their former owners.
The game appears to have been borrowed from European rather than Asiatic sources.
Another set of Eskimo dominoes (Plate 27), differing in their marks from the preceding, is contained in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (Cat. No. ;89,). It was collected by Capt. George Comer from the Central Eskimo of Savage Islands, West Coast of Hudson Bay, and consists of thirty-six pieces of ivory marked with dots, running irregularly from eight on one side down to blank. It is clearly a degenerate form of the European game.

(No. 6), the titles of different officials being painted upon tallies instead of being printed upon a diagram. The form of the tallies suggest the probability of their having been derived from arrows. An American Indian analogue is found in the Micmac game of woltes-takun (p. 697).
28. SuGoROKU. “Double Sixes.” Japan. Board! and teetotum.’
A common game with Japanese children, usually played at the New Year. The diagram or board, which is printed in colors, is divided into a number of divisions distinguished by pictures. One of the most popular forms is called dé chiu, or “traveling” sugoroku, and 1s played upon a large sheet of paper on which are represented the various stopping places on a journey. The moves are made according to the throws with one or more dice, or with a teetotum (Japanese coma). The game exhibited is entitled Nan niyo ichi dai shus-sei sugoroku or “ Boys and girls step by step advancing sugoroku,” and is printed in colors upon a large sheet of paper. Another game in the museum is entitled Kamakura ei-yu sugoroku, or The heroes of Kamakura surgoroku,” and another, Gakko sei-to ben kiyo surgoroku, or “School-students studying sugoroku.” New games are published in Japan at each recurring New Year. Like the corresponding games at the present day in Europe and America, they frequently reflect whatever is uppermost in the popular mind. Thus, in 1894-95 the war with the Chinese gave rise to the Shina sei batsu sugoroku, or “Punishing China surgoroku,” a specimen of which is in the University Museum (Cat. No. 17687). The name sugoroku is more correctly applied to the game of backgammon played with two dice, but is used at the present day in Japan to designate all games played on boards or diagrams in which the moves are made by throwing dice.

numbered stations arranged to represent a snake, the direction being from head to tail.
32, GAME OF GOOSE.' United States. Board, men, and spinning arrow?’ used instead of dice. The board has ninety-nine numbered stations.
33. SNAKE GAME.’ United States.
Board printed in colors with one hundred and twenty-two numbered stations.
The first game of this type published in the United States is said to have been “The Mansion of Happiness,” issued by Mr. 8S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts, about the year 1847, and said to have been copied from an English game. Mr. Ives was the first publisher of games as a business in this country. In 1861 Mr. Milton Bradley of Springfield, Massachusetts, published the ‘“‘ Checkered Game of Life.” These were the forerunners of a large number of similar games in the United States, among which the following are included in the collection of the University of Pennsylvania: “Steeple Chase”; “Yacht Race”; ‘‘ Bicycle Race”; ‘‘Messenger Boy”; ‘‘Round the World,” together with others with more or less fanciful titles invented in order to secure the protection of copyright.
The prototype of the boards in these and the preceding games (Nos. 28 to 32) is to be found in the Korean Nyout circuit.
The following foreign games of the foregoing type are contained in the collection of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania.’
1Cat. No. 16467, Mus. Arch., Univ. Penn.
2A square of cardboard, with the numbers from 1 to 6 arranged in a circle, and a metal arrow fastened to revolve on a pivotinthe center. It and similar contrivances are substituted on account of the prejudice against the use of the dice through their association with gambling.
Cat. No. 175656, U.S.N.M. Gift of Stewart Culin.
4The European specimens are in greater part the gift of Dr. H. Carrington Bolton. See his paper, The Game of Goose, Journal of American Folklore, VIII, p. 145.

The board, 12 by 244 inches, is marked with a design cut in the wood (fig.157). Itis elevated by two strips of wood nailed transversely across the bottom, and bears a nearly obliterated diagram for the same game in blue paint. From the exhibit of the Government of Ceylon at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago. Two or four persons play. In the latter case, two play as partners. Cowries of different kinds are used as men, each player having three. These are called bala, dogs” (singular, balo). The moves are made, according to the throws, with six cowrie shells. ‘The counts are as follows:
6 mouths up =6 5 mouths up =5 4 mouths up = 4 3 mouths up = 3 2 mouths up = 2 1mouth up=—1
The players stand at opposite sides of the bottom of the board and finish at the end of the interior diagram, making the circuit in opposite directions. A player may take and set back an opponent’s piece, unless it be upon one of the squares crossed by diagonals, called cattya. A similar game is played in southern India under the name of Gavalata, or “‘cowrie play,” upon a square checkered board having an odd number of squares upon a side (fig. 158). Two or four persons play, each using one or two cowries as men, which they move according to the throws with four or five cowries.*
When two play, one starts at A and the other at B, moving in the direction of the arrows. The objectis to traverse all the squares to the center. A player kills and sends back an opponent’s piece when his own falls upon the same square, unless it rests in a protected square or “castle.”
These games are clearly related to the following game, Pachisi. The cowries used in it, as in Pachisi, may be regarded as a convenient substitute for staves.

India, consist of a cloth or board, sixteen wooden or ivory pieces or men, and seven cowrie shells. The board consists of four rectangles, with their narrow sides so placed as to form a square in the center (tig. 159). Each rectangle is divided into twenty-four small squares, consisting of three rows of eight squares each. The game is usually played by four persons, each of whom is furnished with four ivory or wooden cones called géte of a peculiar color for distinction, and takes his station opposite one of the rectangles. His pieces, géte, start one by one from the middle row of his own rectangle, beginning at the

division next to the large central space. They then proceed all around the outside rows of the board, passing, of course, through those of the adversaries’ rectangles, traveling from right to left (i. e., contrary to the sun) until they get back to the central row from which they started. Any piece is liable, however, to be taken up and thrown back to the beginning, as in backgammon, by any of the adversaries’ pieces happening to fall upon its square, except in the case of the twelve privileged squares (called chik, ‘forts’), which are marked with a cross; in that case the overtaking piece can not move from its position. Their

motion is determined by throwing six or seven! cowrie shells as dice, which count according as the apertures fall uppermost or not. The counts are as follows: laperture up = 10 2 apertures up = 2 3 apertures up = 3 4 apertures up= 4 5 apertures up = 25 6 apertures up = 30 7 apertures up = 12 No apertures up = 6 A throw of twenty-five or thirty gives an additional move of one. At the last step the throw must amount to exactly one more than the number of squares left to enable the piece to go into the central space, i. ¢., off the board. If it happens to stop on the last square, it can not get off

until twenty-five or thirty is thrown. The players throw in turns, and each goes on until he throws a two, three, or four, when he loses the lead. If the same number be thrown thrice successively, it does not count. The game is generally played with six cowries, making the highest throw twenty-five (the six apertures up then counting twelve); hence it is termed Pachisi (from pachis, twenty-five). The board used is a carpet or some other fabric, ornamented and marked with cloth of different colors sewed upon it. It is sometimes played by two persons, each taking the opposite rectangles with eight pieces and playing them all from the rectangle next to him. The game continues till three of the players get out. They never play for money.”?
The game of Pachisi may be regarded as an expansion and elabora-’ tion of the type of game represented by the Korean Nyout, and sacred
1 The number of shells used as dice in Pachisi and allied games varies from four up to as many as sixteen. ?Herklots, Qanoon-e-Islam, London, 1832.

<<<Page: 1106>>>

and divinatory in its origin. The board itself represents the Four Quarters of the World. Its four arms, each with eight squares, may be regarded as the four arms of the internal cross of the nyout circuit, each of three points extended by the four ares, each of five points.
The position of the “‘castles” or squares marked with a cross on the arms is not always the same,' but commonly, as on the cloth from the Maldives (No. 43), they agree with the large circles at the four quarters of the nyout circuit.
The colors of the men agree with those assigned to the seasons of the year and the four quarters of the world to which they correspond, in Asia. When four persons play, the red and green, and black and yellow play partners. This relation is indicated on the men used in the Burmese game (No. 42), which are painted with the complementary colors, the red men having green tips, and vice versa. This corresponds with the relation assumed to exist between the seasons and the world quarters and their corresponding colors. As each quarter of the world has four quarters, each player in turn has four men. As the men or pieces may be regarded in the cosmical game as actually representing men, they appear as such in the Maldivian game (No. 43) like the men of the Noah’s Ark. The name of the pieces, géte (singular, g0t),? also applied to the pawns in chess, is derived from the Sanskrit ghotaka, a horse. This agrees with the Korean name of the men in Nyout: mal, “horse,” or “horsemen.”
The two faces of the Korean staves, black and white, may be regarded as signifying, as will appear in the following pages, the dual principles of nature, masculine and feminine. A feminine significance is widely attributed to the aperture of the cowrie shell. Its convex side would naturally be regarded as masculine; hence its substitution for the staves would seem to have been an easy transition.
The distribution of the game of Pachisi in Asia, as illustrated by specimens in the U.S. National Museum and the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, is from Syria to the Philippines.

An especial interest is attached to the game of Patolli from the fact of its resemblance to the Hindu Pachisi being regarded as one of the strongest evidences of the Asiatic origin of the old Mexican culture. Attention was first called to this resemblance by Dr. E. B. Tylor in a paper before the Anthropological Institute, entitled “The game of patolli in ancient Mexico and its probable Asiatic origin.” ”
In plate 29 may be seen a picture of Patolli from Duran’s Atlas, the original being in colors.

2Journal of the Anthropological Institute, VIII, 1878. The first writer to discuss the resemblances of the games of the Américan Indians with those of the Old World, as an argument in favor of the Asiatic origin of the American race, was P. Lafitau in his Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains Comparees aux Moeurs des Premiers Temps, Paris, 1724. Under Des Jeux (II, p. 338) he describes and illustrates the plum stone game played upon a mat, and the bowl game, comparing them with the similar custom of throwing cowrie shells, practiced by the negroes of Africa (see p. 815), and with knuckle bones of classical antiquity. He then compares the game of straws, pailles, with cards, and concludes with a parallel between the Indian ball games and those of the Greeks and Romans.

kinds find a parallel in the long and short blocks used in the Nyout game and in the similar staves used in games by certain American tribes. In the case of the latter a ceremonial distinction is said to sometimes exist, one kind being used exclusively by women, who are not permitted to play with the others.

Cloth with four arms, each with three rows of eight squares consisting of silk cloth of different colors.
A detailed account of Pasit is given by Shay Yoe.? The game is also called chuay pyit-thee and ansah pyit-thee. He describes six cowries (chuay) being used, the throws with which count as follows:
1 mouth up —10, ?’sé.
2 mouths up= 2, pah.
3 mouths up= 3, thohn.
4 mouths up= 4, lay.
5 mouths up —25, taseht.
6 mouths up =12, bahyah. Nomouths up= 6, chouk.
These, it will be seen, closely agree with those described on page 853, as do the rules in general. The “castles,” called poh or kyah, are colored red or green. The game is also played with three dice, identical with those described under Chausar (No, 40).

44, Epris A JIN. Edris of the Genii, a game like Pachisi. Druses of Lebanon, Syria. Cloth and cowrie shells used as dice and men.!
The board is much more -complicated than the preceding, consisting of a large square cotton cloth marked with a parti-colored diagram with four arms each having four rows of eight squares, each connected at the ends by a diagonal row of eight squares, the whole forming an octagonal figure. The inner square, composed of sixteen small squares, is called the serait. The moves are made according to the throws with four cowries. Each player has three men, other shells, one of which is called the “chief,” and the others “soldiers.” The former are filled with red sealing wax, to which colored paper is pasted, distinguishing them as red, green, yellow, and black. The name of the game, Hdris, which is applied in Syria to simple games played with men upon boards, among which is Merrels, is the same as that of Enoch,’ the prophet of the Druses.
In this game, which, from its terminology, is possibly of Persian origin, the pieces are differentiated. It appears to be a step in the direction of the game of chess, although not in the direct line.
45. CHATURANGA. Dice chess. Ancient India. Board, men? (reproductions) and die.
The game of Chaturanga, now apparently extinct, is described in detail in the Bhavishya Purana, of which translations have been given by several writers. It was played upon an ordinary chessboard of sixty-four squares by four players, each of whom had eight men, distinguished by the colors red, green, yellow, and black. The men consisted of four foot soldiers or pawns, and a Rajah, Elephant, Horse, and Ship, which are placed in the order of Ship, Horse, Elephant, and Rajah, beginning from the left corner, with the four foot soldiers in front. The partners’ pieces occupy the opposite diagonals. The Rajah, Elephant, and Horse move as the King, Rook, or Castle and Knight in modern chess; the Ship always two squares diagonally, hopping over an intermediate piece if necessary; the foot soldier like the pawn in our own game. The players play alternately in the order of the sun. The moves were made according to the throws with a die marked 2, 3, 4, 5. On throwing 5, the Rajah or a foot soldier was moved; if 4 was thrown, the Elephant; 5, the Horse, and 2, the Ship. It is not certain from the account referred to that the die was employed after the Opening move.
The Rajah was not checkmated in this early game, but is taken like

any other piece. He might, if expedient, be captured by his partner’s men, who thus placed himself in command of both armies.
The name of the game, Chaturanga or “four angas,” is that of the four angas or members of an army, a term which is applied to real armies by the epic poets of India.'
The relation of the game of Chaturanga to the game of Pachisi is very evident. The board is the square of the arm of the Pachisi cross, and even the castles of the latter appear to be perpetuated in the camps, similarly marked with diagonals, on the Chinese chessboard (No. 51). The arrangement of the men at the corners of the board survives in the Burmese game of Chess (No. 46). The four-sided die is similar to that used in Chausar (No. 40). The pieces or men are of the same colors as in Pachisi, and consist of the four sets of men or pawns
of the Pachisit game, with the addition Saekxp ares of the four distinctive chess pieces, the PD wl
origin and significance of which remain to be accounted for. By analogy, it may be assumed that the board, if not indeed all boards upon which games are played, stands for the world and its four quarters (or the year and its four seasons), and that the game itself was originally divinatory.
The theory that modern chess had its origin in Chaturanga, suggested by Capt. Hiram Cox in 1799, and upheld
noe Eee

eee and developed by Prof. Duncan Forbes* PERSIAN CHESS BOARD. mi leseiae has not been accepted by students of
the game generally. The antiquity of the Purana in which it is described, has been questioned, and the game asserted to be a comparatively modern adaptation of the primal Hindu game. Apart from this discussion the relation of Chess to an earlier dice game, such as Pachisi, appears to be evident. The comparative study of games leads to the belief that practically all games as chess, played upon boards, were preceded by games in which the pieces were animated by dice, cowries or knuckle bones, or by staves, as in the Korean Nyout, the Egyptian Tab, and many aboriginal American games.
‘For a further account of the game with a translation of the original authorities, consult Edward Falkener, Games Ancient and Oriental, London, 1892, from which the above is taken.
*'This survival of the Castles on the chessboard is still more clearly seen on the Persian chessboard figured by Hyde, fig. 161. He says: “The chessboard of the Persians living in India is quite square and has the same number of squares. But, in order better to protect the King, some of the squares are ‘crosscut.’ If now the King is hard pressed, he can evade either by changing with the Castle, or move to
one of those crosscut squares.” (Historia Shahiludii, p. 60.) A similar marking is to be observed on the Burmese chessboard. 3 History of Chess, 1860.

The men are made of wood of different colors, or of ivory painted red and green on opposite sides, and carved to represent the objects they stand for.
The pieces on each side are as follows:

From drawing in The Burman, HI, p. 72.
The King, Ratha or Rooks, Mhee or Knights, and Yein or Pawns move in the same manner as the corresponding pieces in our own game. The Chekoy moves diagonally only, but one square at a time. The Chein move one square diagonally, but are able to move, but not to take, one square forward. The pieces are ordinarily arranged as shown on the board (fig. 162), but either party may adopt another line of battle.*

The oldest European chessmen in existence appear to be six ivory pieces, long preserved in the abbey of St. Dennis and now in the National Library at Paris, where they were transferred at the Revolution. According to tradition, they were a gift to the abbey from Charlemagne. The dress and ornaments of these pieces are in keeping with the Greek costume of the ninth century.!

The board, commonly made of paper, has sixty-four squares, which are separated into two parts in the middle by a blank space, the width of one square, called the “River.” Four squares in the middle of each side of the board in the first and second rows nearest the edge are crossed with two diagonal intersecting lines, marking an inclosure, which is called the “Palace.” The pieces on each side, which are placed at the intersections of the lines instead of on the squares, and consist of disks of wood inscribed on both sides with the Chinese character for the name, distinguished by the colors red and blue, are as follows:
Tséung, ‘‘ General” (1) King. Sz’, ‘‘Councillors” (2) Bishops. Tséung, ‘‘ Elephants” (2).
Mad, ‘‘ Horses” (2) = Knights. Ch‘é, ‘‘ Chariots” (2) = Castles.
P‘du, ‘*Cannons” (2). Ping and Tsut (on opposite sides), ‘‘ Foot soldiers” (5) = Pawns.
The ‘‘Generals” are placed in the middle of each outer row with the “Councillors” on either side. Next without them are the two “Horses” with the “Chariots” in the corners. The “Cannons” occupy the first points of intersection from the edges of each of the second rows, while the “ Footsoldiers” are placed in the third row with one intervening point between each of them.
The “General” is not permitted to move outside of his ‘‘ Palace” and only along the perpendicular and horizontal lines. The “Chancellors,”

S., 1895. While these have, here and there, corrected a date, established matters doubted by Van der Linde, and enlarged the information given by him, they have left substantially unchanged the more important features of his work. Thus they have shoved back the date of knowledge of chess among the Arabs a generation, have shown knowledge of chess in Europe some fifty years before the earliest date assigned by him; proved that he spoke too quickly as to the Problem Collection of Bomus Socius comprising the whole problematical chess literature of the Middle Ages, etc. His books are somewhat disfigured by controversial bitterness, and too great critical skepticism; the style is not attractive, but they are mines of information.

The “ Elephants” move two squares diagonally, but can not jump over an intermediate piece nor cross the “River.” The ‘ Horse” has the move of our Knight, but may not jump over an intermediate piece. It may cross the ‘River,” the “River” forming one-half of its move. The ‘Chariot”

The “ Footsoldiers” move and take one point at a time in a forward direction. They can cross the “River,” the “ River” itself being one move. When across, they can move and take either in a forward or lateral direction.

On reaching the opposite end they can move and take only laterally. The “Generals” may not face each other without intervening pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the ‘‘ General.” !
The name of the Chinese game of Chess, T'séung kt, signifies the General’s Game. It is regarded by them as having been invented by Wu Wang, B. C. 1169-1116, the founder of the Chow dynasty.
The name k‘{, which is applied by the Chinese to a great variety of games played with men or pieces upon boards, appears to refer especially to the counters. ‘The relations of the Chinese game to the Indian game are obscure. It was probably introduced at a comparatively early time from India. The manner of placing the men, at the intersections of the lines instead of upon the squares, constitutes one of the principal points of difference.””
Himly, in discussing the origin of Chinese Chess, expresses the opinion that while the game of chess had forerunners the real game originated in India as an effigy of war, and spread from India in the sixth or seventh century to the west to Persia, and to the east to Cambodia, where, as well as in Persia, the name is evidently derived from the Sanskrit Chaturanga (the four army divisions). In the Chinese game the names of neither the board, the game, nor the men point to a foreign origin, nor does tradition say anything about it. Himly states that the first sure trace of chess in China occurs in the Yew kwaé luh,*

The Japanese chessboard consists either of a small table, on four feet, or a paper diagram. It is a square of nine or eighty-one squares, which are slightly oblong in form. The pieces are placed in the squares, not on the intersections as in China. They consist of punt-shaped pieces of wood of different sizes, lying flat upon the board, not upright, and slightly inclined toward the front; the directions of the point determining to whom the piece belongs. Unlike all other games of

chess, the men are all of one color, and thus the same pieces serve for the player and his adversary. Another peculiarity is that any piece taken up may be entered by the adversary in any vacant place he chooses, and at any time he thinks desirable to enter it, such entry constituting his move. The names of the pieces on each side are as follows: ‘Osho, “General” (1) — Kine. Kin sho, ‘Gold Generals” (2). Gin sho, ‘Silver Generals” (2).
Hisha, “Flying Wagon” (1) = Castle. Kakko, ‘Angle going” (1) —= Bishop. Keima,* (2) = Knights. Kyosha, “ Fragrant Chariots” (2).

The O Sho, or “General,” stands in the center of the first row. He moves one square in any direction and loses the game when checkmated. The ‘Gold Generals” stand on either side of the King and move one square in any direction, except the two back diagonals.
The ‘Silver Generals” stand on each side next to the “Gold Generals” and move one square in any direction, except sideways and backward. The Keima stand next to the “Silver Generals” and have our Knight’s move, but only forward. The AKydsha occupy the extreme ends and move any number of squares, perpendicularly only. The Hisha stands in front of the right-hand Keima and has the move of our Castle. The Aakké stands in front of the left-hand Keuma and has the move of our Bishop. The “ Foot soldiers,” or Pawns, occupy the third row, and move and take one square forward only.
The three rows nearest each side constitute the opposing camps. The “King” and ‘Gold Generals” retain their rank unchanged throughout the game, but the following pieces are promoted immediately upon entering the enemy’s camp, when theyare turned over, their new names being written on their reverse sides:
The Hisha becomes Ryo-wo, ** Dragon King,” and has the privilege, in addition to its former power, of moving one square diagonally like the Kakko. The Kakko becomes Ryo-ma, ‘Dragon Horse,” and has the additional power of moving one square forward, sideways, or backward, like the Hisha. The ‘Silver Generals,” Keima, Kydsha, and Hohei, or Pawns, can all attain the rank of ‘Gold Generals.” !

The Korean game of Pa-tok is identical with the famous Chinese game of Wai kt, or “Game of Inclosing” (wai, ‘to inclose”), which is popular in Japan under the name of Go* (No. 56).
It is played by two players upon a board special to the game, with two sets of men of different colors (fig. 172). The board is divided into squares of uniform color, 18 by 18, numbering therefore three hundred and twenty-four. The pieces are played ou the intersection of the hori-

The Korean board is made in the form of a small hollow table, differing from the Japanese board, which consists of a solid block of wood. In China the boards are printed on paper. The men used in Korea are small, polished, black pebbles and irregular pieces of white shell. The players place their men alternately on any of the points of intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines not already occupied, the object of the game being to occupy as much of the board as possible,

victory being decided in favor of the player who has command of the most spots. Space can be occupied in two ways: by placing men on the different points, and by forming an inclosure with one’s men, the space thus contained being reckoned as one’s territory. The latter gives the Chinese name to the game.!
The invention of the game of Wai k‘‘, of which some of the most interesting characteristics are exemplified in the Korean Pa-tok, is attributed by the Chinese to the Emperor Yao (B. ©. 2356), or, according to other

accounts, to the Emperor Shun (B. C. 2255). It is reputed as the first of games in China, Korea, and Japan, and one of the few which receive the approbation of the educated classes in those countries. Simple as the game appears, it embodies certain complex elements based upon primitive notions of the universe, which, although they may in part be secondary and late additions, are of the highest interest. Thus the pieces, black and white, are regarded as representing the night and the day; the four “angles” the four seasons, and the three hundred and sixty-one points of intersection on the board (360 + 1) the number
of days in the year. Nine stations at the intersections, which are

marked with spots upon the board, are, in the same manner, said to correspond with the Nine Lights of Heaven (the Sun, Moon, and the seven stars of the Dipper).
The Chinese in the books which treat of the game divide the board into four equal parts, which they call “corners,” and which they designate by the names of the four tones in the spoken language:
Ping, for the lower left-hand corner;
Shéung, for the upper left-hand corner;
Hii, for the upper right hand corner;
Yap, for the lower right-hand corner.

In each of these four sections a place is generally marked out at a distance of four steps along the principal diagonal counted from the outer angle. Each spot is therefore equally distant from the two external sides of the section. These four points (fig. 173) are called kan, sun, kw‘an, and k‘in. The latter terms are the names given to the diagrams in the magic symbol of the universe, called the Pat kwd, or “Hight Diagrams,” which stand for the directions Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. Like the Nyout circuit, this game board has a cosmnical significance and represents the world. As if to more fully embody and express the relation supposed to exist between the seasons, the world quarters—all things in the universe even to the tones of the voice that distinguish the meaning of words—as well as the notes of the musical scale, two copper wires are strung within the resonant chamber of the Korean board and emit a musical note when a piece is played. In accordance with the theory I have advanced as to the origin of games played upon boards without the intervention of dice, we may expect to find intimations of their use in earlier stages of this game. Such an earlier stage may be represented in the Malayan game of Chuki (No. 55).

say that the word and the thing are of foreign origin, very likely Chinese or CochinChinese.” In a subsequent communication, after comparison with the Chinese K%, a generic name for games played with pieces or men, tséwng kt, ‘‘chess,” and the Cantonese chuk kt, ‘to play chess,” he concludes that these resemblances indicate that the Malay and Javanese chuki, which is almost certainly of extraneous origin, is ultimately from the Chinese.
And later he sends the following entry in which the word is associated with a Chinese form in the Amoy dialect.

Two play, the “General” striving to capture the “Soldiers,” and the latter to block him.
The board and men appear to be an expression of the same cosmical ideas as are found in the game of Nyout, there being four men associated with each side of the square. The traditions of the game still more closely identify it with the Korean Nyout.

In Peru a similar game is played on a board (fig. 183) under the name of Solitario. In Mexico a corresponding game (fig. 184) is called Coyote.'
In Siam we find the game of Sua ghin gnua, or “Tiger and Oxen” (fig. 185), and in Burma, Lay gwet kyah.
There are three big tigers and eleven or sometimes twelve little ones. The object is for the big tigers to hunt down on a draft board and eat the little ones. If, however, the cubs can corner the big ones and prevent them from taking a leap, the latter have to succumb.’

the opening of the game each player places six men in the center of the six squares at his side of the board. The latter usually consists of a slab of stone pecked with the diagram (fig. 187). The men consist of disks of pottery about 1 inch in diameter, made from broken vessels, those upon one side being distinguished by being perforated with a small hole, while those of the other side are plain. The object of the game is to cross over and take the opponent’s place, capturing as many men as possible by the way. The moves are made one square at a time along the diagonal lines, the pieces being placed at the points of intersection. When a player gets one of his opponent’s pieces between two of his own it may be taken, and the first piece thus captured may be replaced by a seventh man, called the ‘‘ Priest of the Bow,” which

Fig. 189. THE GAME OF TO-TO-LOS-PI.
Moki Indians, New Mexico.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes” has described a somewhat similar game as existing among the Moki Indians of New Mexico under the name of To-to-los-pi. It can be played by two or more parties. A rectangular
'Disks roughly shaped from fragments of earthenware vessels were found by Mr. Clarence B. Moore in mounds of the Georgia Coast (Jour. Academy of Natural Sciences, Phila., XI), of which specimens contributed by him are contained in the Museum of Archeology of the University of Pennsylvania (Cat. Nos. 20160-20162). They vary from 14 to 2 inches in diameter. Similar pottery disks, some perforated, are found in many localities in the United States. Mr. G. E. Laidlaw writes that large numbers of disks of stone and pottery are found in the ash beds of ancient village sites in Ontario, Canada, east and northeast of Lake Simcoe. They are seldom bored, and the pottery disks, which range from 1 inch to 2 inches in diameter, are made from shards, and have the original curve of the pot. They bear no markings, and in a great majority of cases the edges are not ground smooth. He suggests their probable use in games. Pottery disks, all made from shards, some with central perforations, are found in Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, and doubtless other South American sites.

figure (fig. 189), divided into a large number of squares, is drawn upon the rock, either by scratching or by using a different colored stone as a crayon. A diagonal line, tuh-ki-o-ta, is drawn across the rectangle from northwest to southeast and the players station themselves at each end of this line. When two parties play, a single person acts as player and the other members of the party act as advisers. The first play is won by tossing a leaf or corn husk with one side blackened. The pieces which are used are bean or corn kernels, stones and wood, or small fragments of any substance of marked color. The players were stationed at each end of the diagonal line, tuh-ki-o-ta. They move their pieces upon this line, but never across it. (On this line the game is fought.) The moves which are made are intricate, and the player may move one or more pieces successively. Certain positions entitle him to this privilege. He may capture, or, as he terms it, kill one or more of his opponents at one play. In this respect the game is not unlike checkers, and to capture the pieces of the opponent seems to be the main object of the game. The checkers, however, must be concentrated. and always moved toward the southeast coruer.'
This game is now rarely played on the East Mesa, but is still used at Oraibi. It is said to have been played in ancient times by the sun and moon or by other mythical personages. Figures of this game formerly existed on the rocks near the village of Walpi, and may be the same referred to by Bourke.
Games resembling the above seem to have existed widely among the American tribes. Mrs. W. W. Brown? gives the following account of a game of the Wabanaki Indians:
Ko-ko-nag’n has a resemblance to the game of Checkers, but, although nearly all are more or less proficient at the latter game, there are only a few who understand ko-ko-nag’n. This, unlike any other game, may be played by male and female opponents. It is the least noisy, the skillful play requiring deliberation and undivided attention. A smooth surface is marked off into different-sized spaces, and pieces of wood, round and square, marked to qualify value, are generally used, though sometimes carved bone is substituted.
This may be the game referred to by Rasle among the Norridgewok Indians, where he says: ‘“ Un antre jeu ot Von place des grains sur des espéece de lozanges entrelassées (dicitur) maimadéoangain.”
‘It would appear from Dr. Fewkes’s sketch of the board that only one player moved toward the southeast and that his opponent went in the opposite direction.

The other principal class of arrow-derived games is that in which a number of staves, splints, or other substituted objects are shaken or divided at random, originally to determine place directly, or to discover the number and thence the place. Like the preceding class, it is widely distributed throughout the world. The divinatory associations of these games are more clearly manifest to the writer than those in which the tossed staves or their substitutes are used, and the derivation of the implements from arrows more easily demonstrable.
An examination of the arrows used by savage people shows that the custom of marking them in such manner that each individual might distinguish his own was very general. From this, both in the Old and the New World, the arrow came to stand as the token and symbol of a man,'and as such, among many other symbolic uses, was employed in divinatory games. It appears that the marks of the arrows of the American Indians, which are placed upon the shaftments, refer not, it would seem, to the personal names of their owners, but to their owners’ place in the system of classification according to the directions in the circuit of the clans. At a later period of development we find these cosmical marks replaced by the written name of the owner, as in Eastern Asia. Traces still survive, even here, as on the practice arrows of Korea (No. 78) of the earlier system.
The method of marking in America is by means of colored bands (ribbons) painted upon the shaftments. It may be assumed that a quiver made up of the different arrows of the individuals of a tribe would represent the Four Quarters and the intermediary points. It is such perfect quivers and their conventionalized representatives that constitute the implements of magic employed in the games which follow. In connection with these there are exhibited several series of arrows, together with a variety of objects regarded by the writer as having been derived from the empioyment of arrows as symbols of personality.
61. TonGc-KaAt. Korea.
(a) Quiver of Ceremonial Arrows.” Worn as an emblem of rank by Korean officials in military court-dress.
'The symbolism of the arrow was discussed by Mr. Cushing in his vice-presidential address before Section H of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Springfield, 1895. According to him, ‘‘owner’s marks, on arrows, were not designed primarily as signs of mere possession. They were indicative, rather, of the place in the cosmically arranged circuit of the tribe, of the man who made and possessed the arrows. It is probable that such marks were at first placed on arrows to serve as protective and directive potencies. By imparting somewhat of the man’s personality to the arrows, their special aid to him was insured and at the same time their flight was endowed with the breath or wind of the quarter to which he and they alike belonged. It naturally followed that, much as his face was recognizable as belonging to him, so were these arrows recognizable as essentially of his place and of him—so much so, that ceremonially they often stood for the man himself even more intimately than do our signatures stand for us.” But the second part of this highly important paper, in which this was embodied, remains unpublished.

(b) Reproduction of native picture of Korean officials in military court-dress wearing quiver with arrows.!
The quiver exhibited has ten arrows, while in the native picture five arrows are represented as being worn. These are regarded by the writer as corresponding with the Five Directions, and as symbols of regnal or universal authority.’ They are worn by the King himself, as well as officers who receive orders from him. The actual arrows are 26 inches in length, made of lacquered bamboo with white feathering and no points. The quiver is of Japanese leather ornamented with silver disks and sewed along the edges with colored silk.?
Chinese generals wear (or wore) a set of six arrows as an insignia of rank. A set of such arrows (Cat. No. 17686) in the Museum of the University, picked up in August, 1894, on the field of A-San in Korea, three days after the battle, by Dr. E. B. Landis, are six in number (fig. 190), The shafts are of white wood, 37 inches in length, feathered with two

The tallies are kept by a member of the guild, who summons the members by sending each his tally. This constitutes the credentials of the person bringing it to the meeting.
These tallies are direct descendants of the arrows used in more primitive conditions for the same purpose Their name, ts’(m, is almost identical with the Chinese name for arrow, and their form still retains a suggestion of their origin.

When a free-born Korean boy reaches the age of 15, he has a small wooden label cut, which he carries with him. This label is made of pear wood or mahogany, and is about 2 inches in length by 4} inch broad. It is inscribed in Chinese characters. Across the top is the name of the Pou (Chinese pu) or ward to which the boy belongs. Then in a line below the designation han-ryang, “leisure fellow,” that is, not in government service, and the boy’s name with the date of his birth. The date on which the label is made is cut on the reverse. This label must be sealed by an official of the treasury, who brands it with a hot iron and registers the boy’s name and other particulars. When a boy enters the Tjin-sd (Chinese, tswn sz’), he has another tablet cut, this time of boxwood, with his proper title instead of han-ryang. Upon passing the military or civil examinations, the label is cut from black horn, and upon obtaining the first grade an ivory label is permitted. Since writing the above account, which was dictated by Mr. Pak Young Kiu, Korean Charge d’Affaires at Washington, I have received from Dr, E. B. Landis, at Chemulpo, two specimens of ho-hpai

(figs. 192, 193), concerning which he gave the following particulars: ‘“‘I have simply had reproductions made, as they are not in use since the war. They are, however, exact reproductions, with the exception of the magistrate’s seal, which was always burnt on the back. At the top, reading from right to left, are the words Yon Hak and Han Iyang. These refer to the class of society to which he belongs. The first is ‘‘Patrician” and the second ‘ Plebeian.” After this follows the name and surname and in the lower corner the year of birth. On the back is the year when the ho-hpat expires. It isrenewed every three years. There is another kind called yo-hpai (Plate 33), which was used by the servants of the various officials as proof of identity when drawing their monthly wages, which was always paid in kind.” Yo-hpai (Chinese, iv p’di) is defined in the Dictionaire Coréen Francais as ‘‘ plaque des soldats sur lequelle leur nom est écrit.” The secret agents of the king in Korea, called E-sa (Chinese, wi sz’), used a plate of silver engraved with a horse as an emblem of their royal authority.

Analogous to these Korean objects are the tablets of authority carried by the Mongol princes, which are described by Marco Polo (Plate 34). These were of silver, silver gilt, and of gold, and were inscribed with a legend commanding respect in the name of the Kaan. To this was added the figure of a lion, and below the sun and moon, while the highest lords received a tablet with gerfalcons. I have been led to refer to these Pdizah, which are so fully described and illustrated by Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, Book II, C. VII, Note 2), through their suggesting in connection with other objects a theory of the origin of the so-called ‘‘cash” or current money of China (fig. 194). These coins, which uniformly bear the name of the regnal period, by which the sovereign is known to the world, may be regarded as having been, like the Pdizah, emblems of authority emanating from the sovereign. Specimens of Chinese bamboo money (Plate 35), similar in appearance to the Korean ho-hpai, occur in the Glover collection in the United States National Museum.

ing five kinds of scepters
made of precious stones. Of these, the two lowest classes were round with a hole in the center and about 5 inches in diameter. A specimen in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 130662, gift of Chang Yen Hoon, His Imperial Chinese Majesty’s envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary) (Plate 36)is made of jade, and is of the kind designated as kuk pik, or “ grain-besprinkled slab.”
We have in these scepters an ancient emblem of authority corresponding in form to the coin. When we examine the name of the latter, we find it to be ts’in, a word differing but slightly from tsi, “arrow,” from which I regard both the coin and tablet as having in all probability been derived. The character for ts’in is written with the radical for “spear” doubled, with the radical for ‘‘metal” on the left. It differs in the substitution of metal for p‘ in, a “leaf” or “slip,” from the character ts used in writing the name of the Korean playing cards, htou-tjyen (Chinese, tau tsin) (No. 77).
Analogous to the Korean ho-hpai are the amulet bags (mamori bukuro, protection bag), which Japanese children used to wear outside their dresses with a ticket containing their names and residences attached. ““At a later period they are concealed; but all classes wear them during their natural lifetime. Some of them contain Sanskrit characters, others pictures or names of Shinto divinities or Buddhist saints, while all contain the navel cord of the wearer with the date of his birth inscribed.”!
The Tlingit make and carry small flat bone and ivory tablets. A number collected by Lieut. George T. Emmons, U. S. N., in the United States National Museum (Cat. No. 168372) are represented in figs, 195-200.

The usual size of the tanzaku is about 24 by 144 inches. They are frequently made of a thin strip of wood. The name is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese tiin ch‘ak ‘‘a short list or memoranda,”! and the object itself may be regarded as a survival from the time when books were engraved on similar strips of bamboo, like existing Buddhist scriptures in Siam.

These blocks, called sangi, or ‘calculating sticks,” are placed before the fortuneteller, parallel to each other and with their plain faces uppermost, The fortune teller takes the bundle of splints in his right hand and raises them reverentially to his forehead. He then places the ends in the palm of his left hand and shuffles them with a rotary motion (fig. 204), Taking the bundle in his right hand, he places one so that it projects between his little finger and his third finger (fig. 205), Dividing the remainder in two parts, he places one of the bundles between his middle finger and forefinger and the other between his forefinger and thumb. The latter bundle is then counted, taking four splints at a time around the Pat kwa or “ Kight Diagrams” (fig. 206), beginning at the one consisting of unbroken lines designated by the Chinese character k’in, and corresponding with the Northwest.

The indication obtained from these two operations is then referred to the corresponding diagram in the Yik King or “ Divination Classic,” and the fortune teller draws his conclusions from the text which explains it, aided by traditional interpretations. _
In this system of divination we have an illustration of the use of arrow-derived splints divided at random to determine the number, place being ascertained by counting around a diagram, the Pdt kwd, symbolic of the World Quarters. It is also practised at the present

It is described minutely in one of the appendices to the “ Divination Classic.”! According to the Chinese record, the stalks of a plant, the Ptarmica Siberica were used, those which grew on the grave of Confucius being most highly esteemed. The assumption that the zeichaku (Chinese, shai chuk)” were originally arrows is based upon analogy, the arrow derivation of many similar objects employed in divination being clearly apparent. The sangi (Chinese, siin muk), or “calculating sticks” may be regarded as sur-

viving from or suggested by the two-faced staves, from which the diagrams originated.
The above-described method of divination has a counterpart in the Chinese game of Fan tan, or “repeatedly spreading out,” which is played in the gambling houses established by the immigrants from China in many American cities. Fdn t‘dn is played with a quantity of Chinese brass “cash,” for which buttons and other small objects are sometimes substituted. These take the place of the splints or zeichaku. The dealer covers a handful of these cash, taken at random from the pile, with a brass
~cup.! The players lay their wagers on the four sides of a square, numbered “ one,” “two,” “three,” and “four.” The dealer then divides off the ‘‘ cash” under the cup by fours, using for the purpose a tapering rod” of teak wood, about 18 inches in length. When all the fours are counted off, the winner is determined by the number remaining.’ In these operations we have the random partition of ‘ cash” substituted for that of splints, and the square with its four numbered sides (corresponding with the Four Quarters) for the Pit kwd or “Eight Trigrams” around which the splints are counted.
Analogous also to the Chinese and Japanese method of divination with splints is the Malagassy Sikidy, a system of fortune-telling in common use in Madaoe
. oe . : METHOD OF SHUFFLING ZEICHAKU, gascar, in which beans, rice, or other small objects that can be easily counted or divided, are employed. A quantity of beans are placed in a heap, and from these a handful is taken at random. From this handful the diviner withdraws first two, then two more, and so on successively until two only are left, or, it may be, the odd number, one. The process is repeated and the remainders, one or two, are marked in tables of squares, from which the determinations are afterwards made.
The method of marking down, by means of one or two dots, is identical with that frequently employed in divining with the splints. The process is repeated four times, one of sixteen combinations being

In order to explain the Malagassy names, which in part at least are Arabic, M. Steinschneider! gives a table, compiled from a Hebrew lot book in Munich, with the Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, and Berber designations of these combinations of dots. The figures, he states, are supposed to represent the astrological “houses” connected with the planets. They are distinguished as male and female—a distinction which we may assume exists in the single and double dots, as in the unbroken and broken lines. Steinschneider assumes that this supposed Arabic science was transplanted by scholars like Abraham ibn Essa and Jehuda al-Charisi, who traveled from Spain in Europe and the Orient in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, through so-called lot books into Hebrew.
Sibree relates that in a simple form of Sikidy an indefinite number of grass stalks are counted off in twos until only one or two are left.’

A method of fortune telling, based upon the sixteen combinations of single and double dots, taken four at a time, worked by means of a table not unlike that employed in sikidy, is to be found in a popular handbook entitled, ““‘The Gypsy Dream Book and Fortune Teller,” M. J. Ivers & Co., New York, under the title of “The Oraculum; or, Napoleon Buonaparte’s Book of Fate.”

Reviewing the references in the Greek and Roman classics to divinatory practices with rods resembling those above described, there is to be found in Ammianus Marcellinus! the following account of the custom of the Alani:
They predict the future in a marvelous way. They take straight rods of osier, and, separating them with certain
secret charms at a fixed time, they know clearly what is meant.”
Herodotus relates:
Seythia has an abundance of soothsayers, who foretell the future by means of a number of willow wands. A large bundle of these wands is brought and laid on the ground. The soothsayer unties the bundle and places each wand by itself,? at the same time uttering his prophecy. Then, while he is still speaking, he gathers the rods together again, and makes them up once more into a bundle. This mode of divination is of home growth in Scythia. 4
The latter account does not agree except so far as concerns the bundle of rods, but almost exact parallels to the zeichaku, both in number and method of manipulation, are to be found among many abo;

under the caption of “Straw or Indian Cards,” from which I have extracted the following:
To play the game a number of straws or reeds uniform in size and of equal length were required. They were generally from 6 to 10 inches long. The number used in the game was arbitrary. Lawson puts it at fifty-one, Charlevoix at two hundred and one. The only essential points were that the numbers should be odd and that there should be enough of them so that when the pile was divided into two parts, a glance would not reveal which of the two divisions contained the odd number of straws. In its simplest form the game consisted in separating the heap of straws into two parts, one of which each player took, and he whose pile contained the odd number of straws was the winner. Before the division was made the straws were subjected
to a manipulation, somewhat after
3 the manner of shuffling cards. They were then placed upon the deerskin Sovth oes ‘. —— 8 or upon whatever other article was f oY —_—— op. selected as a surface on which to play.

the lookerson, and the fact that the counting was done by tens is almost invariably mentioned. Between two people betting simply on the odd number no further rules were necessary. To determine which had the heap containing the odd number, there was no need to foot up the total number of tens. It was to be settled by what was left over after the last pile of complete tens was set aside. The number itself might be either one, three, five, seven, ornine. In the more complicated forms of the games this led to giving different values to these numbers, the nine being always supreme and the one on which the highest bets were wagered. It was generally understood that the holder of this number swept the board, taking all bets on other numbers as well as those on nine. It was easy to bet beads against beads and skins against skins in a simple game of odd or even, but when the element of different values for different combinations was introduced some medium of exchange was needed to relieve the complications.
‘An explanation is here suggested for the origin of the familiar game of jackstraws, in which a bundle of splints allowed to fall at random in a pile are separated one by one without disturbing the others. Mr. E. W. Nelson informs me that a game identical with jackstraws is played by the Eskimo of Norton Sound on the Yukon River, Alaska. The sticks, which are made of spruce or cottonwood, or any ordinary driftwood, are about the size of a match, squared, and about four inches in length. Those he collected for the U. 8. National Museum were tied with a cord in a bundle of about one hundred. The sticks each have the same value. They are separated by means of a slender stick a little longer than the others. Another method of using these sticks is to lay the bundle on the back of the hand, toss them

Stones of fruit were employed, just as chips or counters are used in modern gambling games, and a regular bank was practically instituted. Each player took a certain number of these counters as the equivalent of the value of the merchandise which he proposed to hazard on the game, whether it was a gun, a blanket, or some other article. Here we have all the machinery of a regular gambling game at cards, but the resemblance does not stop here. The players put up their bets precisely as they now do in a game of faro, selecting their favorite number and fixing the amount, measured in the standard of the game, which they wish to hazard. ‘‘By the side of the. straws, which are on the ground, are found the (grains) counters,” says Perrot, ‘“‘which the players have bet on the game.” In another place the method of indicating the bets is stated as follows: ‘‘He (meaning the one who has bet) is also obliged to make two other heaps. In one he will place five, in the other seven straws, with as many (grains) counters as he pleases. * * * Complicated rules determined when the players won or lost, when the bets were to be doubled, and when they were to abide After native drawing in Our Neighborhood, by T.

The loser at the game, even
after all he had with him was gone, was sometimes permitted to continue the game on his promise to pay. If ill luck still pursued him the winner could refuse him credit and decline to play for stakes that he could not see. The game often lasted several days, one after another relieving his comrades at the play until one of the

into the air, and catch them on the palm. If the player succeeds in grasping them all he lays one splint aside and tries again.
The antiquity of the game of jackstraws in India appears to be illustrated by a passage in the Tevigga Sutta (The Magghima Silam, 4; The Sacred Books of the East, XI, Oxford, 1881, p. 193) in a list of games detrimental to the progress of virtue. “That is to say, with a board of sixty-four squares, or one hundred squares ; tossing up; removing substances from a heap without shaking the remainder.”
In Canton, China, children use splints from burnt punk sticks (héung k’euk, literaily, ‘‘incense feet”), one hundred being held in a bunch and allowed to fall, the players endeavoring to remove them one at a time from the pile without disturbing the others, using another stick bent over at the end for the purpose. They call the game Vit héung k’euk. The Chinese at Canton make carved jackstraws, but I am informed by Chinese merchants that they are sold only for export. A set in the University Museum (Cat. No. 16221) (Plates 38, 39) consists of forty-two pieces, twenty small pointed sticks, twenty miniature weapons and implements, and two hooks for removing the splints. They are made of sandal wood, 44 inches in length, and their name is given by the venders as héung t‘o pdt po.

two sides had lost everything. * * * The game of straw,” says Perrot,! from whose account we have made the foregoing digest, ‘‘is ordinarily held in the cabins of the chiefs, which are large, and are, so to speak, the Academy of the Savages.”
Lawson? describes it, but in slightly modified form, as follows:
“Indian Cards.—Their chiefest game is a sort of Arithmetick, which is managed by a parcel of small split reeds, the thickness of a small Bent. These are made very nicely, so that they part, and are tractable in their hands. They are fifty-one in number, their length about 7 inches. When they play, they throw part of them to their antagonist. The art is to discover, upon sight, how many you have, and what you throw to him that plays with you. Some are so expert at their numbers that they will tell ten times together what they throw out of their hands. Although the whole play is carried on with the quickest motion it is possible to use, yet some are so expert at this game as to win great Indian Estates by this Play. A good set of these reeds fit to play withal are valued and sold for a dressed doe-skin.”
The first game described by Roger Williams?® in his Chapter on Gaming is ‘‘a game like unto the English Cards, yet instead of Cards they play with strong Rushes.” In his vocabulary he gives ‘‘ Akésuog: they are at cards, or telling Rushes; Pissinné-

ganash: their playing Rushes; Ntakésemin: I am a telling or counting; for their play isa kind of Arithmatick.” Strachey found this game among the Indians in Virginia. He describes it as follows: ‘‘Dice play, or cardes, or lotts, they know not, how be it they use a game upon rushes much like primero, wherein they card and discard and lay a stake or two, and so win or lose.”
Mr. Davis cites other references to the game by Fathers Brebeuf,* Boucher,® Lafitau,® Charlevoix,’ and Beverly,* none of which throw any additional light upon it.

CHESS AND PLAYING-CARDS. oul *
About fifteen years ago the late Rev. J. Owen Dorsey gave the following account of a corresponding game among the Omaha: '!
Ja®-¢awa, Stick-counting, is played by any number of persons with sticks made of déska or sidthi. These sticks are all placed in a heap, and then the players, in succession, take up some of them in their hands. The sticks are not counted until they have been taken up, and then he who has the lowest odd number always wins. Thus, if one player had five, another three, and a third only one, the, last must be the victor. The highest number that anyone can have is nine. If ten or more sticks have been taken those above nine do not count.’
Light is throwa upon the origin and significance of these games in America by the account of the Tiyotipi of the Dakota, by Stephen R. Riggs.’ ‘The exponent of the Phratry was the ‘ Tiyotipi,’ or ‘Soldiers’ Lodge.’ Its meaning is the ‘Lodge of Lodges.’ There were placed the bundles of black and red sticks of the soldiers. There the soldiers gathered to talk and smoke and feast. There the laws of the encampment were enacted.” Describing the lodge, he says:
A good fire is blazing inside, and we may just lift up the skin-door and crawl in. Toward the rear of the tent, but near enough for convenient use, is a large pipe placed by the symbols of power. There are two bundles of shaved sticks about 6 inches long. The sticks in one bundle are painted black and in the other red. The black bundle represents the real men of the camp—those who have made their mark on the warpath. The red bundle represents the boys and such men as wear no eagle feathers.
Again he says:
Then of all the round-shaved sticks, some of which were painted black and some painted red, four are especially marked. They are the four chiefs of the Tiyotipi that were made. And these men are not selected at random for this place; but men who have killed many enemies and are most able are chosen.
In conclusion, Mr. Riggs adds:
The special making of the sticks is done on the line of personal history. Whatever is indicated by the kind of eagle feathers a man is entitled to wear in his head, and by the notches in them, this is all hieroglyphed on his stick in the Tiyotipi. Then these bundles of sticks are used for gambling. The question is, ‘‘Odd or even?’ The forfeits are paid in meat for the Tiyotipi.
This highly suggestive account reveals the splints or straws of the American games as derived from the ceremonial emblems of the warriors of the tribe. The identity of the splints with the Haida gamblingsticks (No. 76), both in number and method of use, is clearly apparent.
‘Omaha Sociology, Third Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1884, p. 338.
“Mr. Francis Le Fleche mentioned an Omaha game to the writer under the name of Zané kiddé, as played with sticks or straws, fifty-two in all. “It is pretty much like card-playing.” Miss Alice C. Flecher writes me that ‘the true name of the game is zthon-ni-gki-de. This is an old word, and not a descriptive name, whereas the name given by Mr. Dorsey is a descriptive name and only sometimes used to designate this game. The name given by Mr. Dorsey, zhon-dha-wa, is composed of zohn, “wood,” and dha-wa, ‘‘to count.”

The latter I have shown to be direct substitutes for arrow-shaftments,
hence the derivation of the splints from similar shaftments may be
regarded as assured.

2 Among the Chinese in the United States the God of War is invariably appealed to in using these lots. They are placed upon the little ledge, or altar before his shrine (Plate 40), which is maintained practically for the purpose of such divination. With the splints are invariably two elliptical pieces of wood, kdw pi (fig. 212), rounded on one side and flat on the other, usually made of the root stock of the bamboo. The inquirer, after making the usual sacrifices, throws the blocks to

These instruments, taken in connection with a set of arrows worn by a Chinese general, described on page 882, serve to make clear the reference in Ezekiel xxi, 21, where Nebuchadnezzar, at the parting of two ways, uses divination with arrows to decide whether he shall proceed against Jerusalem or Rabbah.

In tossing the blocks, if both fall with their curved sides uppermost the indication is a negative one, heither good or evil; if both fall with the flat sides uppermost the indication isunfavorable; if one falls with the curved side uppermost and the other the reverse the indication is good. It is customary to throw the blocks until they fall three times alike in succession.

in which marked arrows were shaken from a quiver. Ten or eleven arrows were used, of which seven were marked. They were made of the wood of a particular tree, and were of a yellow color. The seven marked arrows which had distinguishing notches on the shaftment were each designated by a name.
A very complete account of the game is given by Dr. Anton Hiiber,' of which an extract is to be found in Korean Games, XX XIII.

It should be observed that the term al maisar (meisir) is now understood to include all games of chance or hazard.” The heathen Arabs were accustomed to divine by means of arrows in a manner similar to the Meisir, of which an account is found in the Preliminary Discourse to Sale’s Koran.’
‘Uber das Meisir genannte Spiel der heidnischen Araber, Leipzig, 1883.
? Hughes’ Dictionary of Islam.
‘Another practice of the idolatrous Arabs, forbidden also in one of the abovementioned passages (Koran, Chap. V), was that of divining by arrows. The arrows used by them for this purpose were like those with which they cast lots, being without heads or feathers, and were kept in the temple of some idol, in whose presence they were consulted. Seven such arrows were kept at the temple of Mecca, but generally in divination they made use of three only, on one of which was written, “My Lord hath commanded me ;” on another, ‘‘ My Lord hath forbidden me,” and the third was blank. If the former was drawn, they looked upon it as an approbation of the enterprise; if the second, they made a contrary conclusion; but if the third happened to be drawn, they mixed them and drew them over again. These divining arrows were generally consulted before anything of moment was undertaken, as when a man was about to marry, or about to go on a journey. (The Preliminary Discourse, Sec. V.)

<<<Page: 1178>>>

While the Chinese lots at the present day are inscribed simply with a number referring to the corresponding pages of a book (as No. 70), in which is to be found both the oracle and its explanation, it is not unlikely that the oracle was originally engraved or written upon the lot itself, such lots being the natural outcome from tle engraved or painted arrow shaftment, from which I assume they were derived. An explanation of the origin of the sortes of the Romans is naturally suggested. The sortes were little tablets or counters of wood, or other materials, upon each of which some rough verse or poverb was written. After they had been mixed together a boy would draw one at random, which was then taken as an omen.’ Cicero? describes the Sortes at Preeneste as being engraved in ancient characters on oak, and kept in a chest of olive wood.

71. PAK KOP P‘IU TS‘im U.A Lots cast by gamblers. Canton, China.
Highty bamboo lots, identical with No. 69, except that they are numbered from one to eighty. Cast by gamblers before playing in the lottery called the Pak kop piu (No. 72) to determine the numbers they should play. Kept in Chinese shrines of the God of War in China and the United States for the convenience of gamblers.
These lots, which are used ceremonially to divine the lucky numbers, are doubtless survivals from the time when such lots were actually used in the drawings. In Korea, lotteries called San-htong, appear to be a distinct outcome from the kyei, or money-lending clubs. In the latter a hundred men each contribute a certain sim monthly, the drawings being made with numbered wooden balls, which are shaken from a globular wooden box, san-htong.? The lotteries are drawn in the same manner, and it should be observed that the name of the box, san-htong, is the Chinese ts’im Vung, applied to the lot-arrows in their quiver. The globular box and numbered balls are analogous to the Italian lottery, in which numbered balls (No. 74) are shaken from a bottle-shaped basket.

Twenty characters are drawn at random at each drawing, and the players win in proportion to the number they guess.” The name of the lottery, pak kop, “White Pigeon,” is probably a slarg phrase for pak hop, meaning ‘one hundred united,” a name which is quite intelligible in the light of the Korean money-lending clubs.

One name is selected as the winning one before each drawing, and the players who guess it receive thirty times the amount of their bet. Below each of the proper names on the chart are the names of various animals, common occupations, of noted characters in the popular romances and histories, and of miscellaneous objects, such as ‘‘jade,” ‘Sa corpse,” and the ‘“Tutelary Spirit.” This heterogeneous collection, which somewhat resembles the list of objects in the dream books sold in our shops for the use of “policy” players, is employed by gamblers for a similar purpose. The picture of a man, marked with 4 thirty-six names at various parts of his body, forms part of the same scheme. This 2 employment is secondary to another pur} pose. Before drawing the lottery, the manWP ager distributes among the players copies Aa of an enigma (fig. 215), which must contain some demonstrable reference to the name written under the proper name selected for the day, or to the part of the body upon a which that name is written. These enigmas are written in metrical form, and are RE composed as required by the writer of the lottery. He endeavors to mislead the players, but is obliged to give a satisfactory Fe, explanation of the connection between his verses and the name displayed. ! :

These balis (fig. 216) made of boxwood, are numbered from one to ninety. Their probable origin is suggested by the Korean san-htong, as described on page 902. The resemblance of these strung balls to a rosary has suggested to the writer that that object may have had a similar origin and cosmical symbolism.

Mr. James G. Swan? gives the following ac-
count of the method of play:
The Haida use sticks or pieces of wood 4 or 5 inches long and beautifully polished. They are made of yew, and each stick has some designating mark upon it. There is one stick entirely colored and one entirely plain. Each player will have a bunch of forty or fifty of these sticks, and each will select either of the plain sticks as his favorite, just as in backgammon or checkers the players select

of finely separated cedar bark, which is as fine as tow and kept constantly near him, he divides the pins into two parcels, which he wraps up in the bark, and passes them rapidly from hand to hand under the tow, and finally moves them round on the ground or mat on which the players are always seated, still wrapped in the fine bark, but not covered by the tow. His opponent watches every move that is made from the very first with the eagerness of a cat, and finally, by a motion of his finger, indicates which of the parcels the winning stick isin. The player, upon such indication, shakes the sticks out of the bark, and, with much display and skill, throws them one by one into the space between the players till the piece wanted is reached, or else, if it is not there, to show that the game is his. The winner takes one or more sticks from his opponent’s pile, and the game is decided when one wins all the sticks of the other.
Dr. Franz Boas,‘ in his Report of the Northwestern Tribes of Canada, 1895, gives the following account of the methods of play among the Niskké (Chimmesyan):
Qsan.—Guessing game, played with a number of maple sticks marked with red or black rings, or totemic designs. Two of these sticks are trumps. The object of the

game is to guess 1n which of the two bundles of sticks, which are wrapped in cedar bark, the trump is hidden. Each player uses one trump only.
Another apparently similar game he describes as follows:
Matsqé'n.—About thirty small maple sticks are divided into four or five lots of unequal numbers. After a first glance one of the players is blindfolded, the others change the order of the lots, and the first player must guess how many sticks are now in each lot. When he guesses right in three, four, or five guesses out of ten— according to the agreement of the players—he has won.
The sets of sticks are almost uniformly contained in a leather pouch, with a broad flap, to which a long thong is attached, passing several times around the pouch and having a pointed strip of bone, horn, or ivory at the end. The latter is slipped under the thong as a fastening. These sticks, which are used by several of the tribes of the northwest coast of America, are probably simply conventionalized shaftments of arrows, as will be seen by comparing them with the arrows of the McCloud River Indians (No. 75). Fig. 217 represents the cut shaftment of an actual arrow, still bearing bands of red paint, found among the débris of a cliff dwelling in Mancos Canyon, which Mr. Cushing regards as having been intended for a game in the manner of the sticks.
Fig. 217.
CUT ARROW SHAFTMENT. Length, 6 inches. Cliff dwelling in Mancos Canyon, Colorado. Museum of Archeology, University of Pennsylvania.
From the account of the sticks used among the Dakota (p. 897), to which the Northwest Coast sticks are analogous, it seems probable that each stick in a set stands, or originally stood, for a warrior of the tribe. It will be seen from the sticks collected by Lieutenant Emmons that they are designated by what appear to be the names of the gentes. Comparison of the sticks herein described show that no two sets are exactly alike,’ a variation which, under the circumstances, would be natural. Through the courtesy of Dr. Franz Boas, of the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, I am able to give the following list of two sets of sticks’ in that museum, collected and labeled by Lieut. George T. Emmons, U.S. N., which are of the highest importance in their study. By reference to Gibb’s Vocabularies, it appears they were obtained from the Taku tribe of the Koluschan family, occupying Taku Inlet, Alaska.’ They are catalogued under the name of Alh-kar, from Sitka.
‘There is a general agreement in the red and black ribbons, but the number and arrangement of these varies on the sticks in each set. Several sticks marked alike frequently occur, as in the named sets collected by Lieutenant Emmons. ll of the painted sets contain sticks like those in these two sets.
*My attention was called to these sticks by my friend Mr. Cushing, who kindly placed his drawings of them at my disposal.

The carved gambling-sticks furnish a suggestion as to the probable origin of the seal-cylinder such as was used in ancient Babylonia. Cylindrical stamps of unglazed pottery, pierced with a hole like the seal-cylinder of Asia, are found in various parts of Ameriva. Sucha stamp from Ecuador, bearing a highly conventionalized device of a bird (Plate 41, fig. 3), might readily have been derived from a carved arrowshaftment, and it is reasonable to believe that the Babylonian seal, often bearing devices of animals, and the carved gambling-stick, the emblem and symbol of a man, should have had a similar origin.!
The set of American Indian gambling: sticks may be regarded as the antitype of the pack of playing-cards, to which, as will appear from the Korean htou-tjyen (No. 77), they directly lead.
77. HToU-TJYEN. Playing-Cards.2 Korea.
(a) Pack of eighty cards.
(b) Reproduction of native pictures; gamblers playing Htou-tjyen.° (Plate 44.)
The ecards consist of strips of oiled paper 8 inches long by 4 inch wide. The backs are uniformly marked with the seroil as represented on fig. 218. The cards are divided into eight suits as follows (fig. 219):
Sa-ram (Chinese, yan), ‘‘ man.” Moul-ko-ki (Chinese, ii), “fish.” Ka-ma-koui (Chinese, %), ‘‘crow.” Kkoueng (Chinese, chi), ‘‘ pheasant.” No-ro (Chinese, chéung), ‘‘ antelope.” Pyel (Chinese, sing), “star.”
Htok-ki (Chinese, 6), ‘‘rabbit.”
Mal (Chinese, md), ‘‘ horse.” 4
The cards of each suit are distinguished by numerals from 1 to 9 (fig. 220), the tenth card being designated as tjyang, “General.” (Plate 44.) <A variety of games are played with the cards in Korea, the games in general resembling those played with cardsin China. At the present day a pack usually consists of forty to sixty cards of four or six suits instead of eight, and the suit marks are not represented upon the numeral-cards, as cards of all suits have precisely the same value in the commonest game.
' Korean Games, p.xxxii. Itis gratifying to the writer that his theory of the origin of the seal-cylinder should have received such ready acceptance and confirmation by his colleague, Prof. Herman V. Hilprecht, of the University of Pennsylvania. In his Old Babylonian Inscriptions (I, Pt. 2, Philadelphia, 1896, p. 36), he writes: ‘“‘It becomes now very evident that the Babylonian seal-cylinder, with its peculiar shape and use, has developed out of the hollow shaft of an arrow marked with symbols and figures, and is but acontinuation and elaboration in a more artistic form of an ancient primitive idea.” .
* Cat. No. 77047, U.S.N.M. Collected by Lieut. J. B. Bernadou, U.S. N.
’From Korean Games.
*These suit marks may be regarded as the symbols of the Eight Directions, and agree somewhat closely, though evidently earlier, with the Eight Creatures: Horse, Ox, Dragon, Fowl, Swine, Pheasant, Dog, Goat, associated with the Eight Diagrams.

The origin and signiticance of Korean playing-cards are revealed
both by their designs and by their name. ‘The latter, htou-tjyen, is the Chinese tau tsin, meaning ‘ fighting tablets,” tsin being a narrow slip intended to write on. Examining the reverse of the cards (fig. 218) the device is seen to represent the feather of an arrow. Conmiparison of the eighty cards with the eighty arrow-derived lots shows their practical identity, and we may conclude that the cards are highly conventionalized shaftments of arrows, retaining in their suit marks the same symbolism as that of the quiver of arrows from which they were derived. The Japanese mikwji, or ‘‘temple-lots” (No. 68), no doubt illustrate, both in form and material, an earlier stage of the present paper cards. Mr. Wilkinson informed me that the Koreans say that the ‘*‘ tens” or “General” cards once bore pictures, more or less carefully drawn, of the various emblems portrayed, of which the present scrawls are declared to be corruptions. This would seem to carry back, directly, the cards toward the type represented by the carved gambling-stick (No. 76 b).
Of the Korean games with cards, which are described in detail in “‘ Korean Games,” the most common one is similar to the American Indian game of Straw (p. 594). Its name is Yet-pang-mang-i.!
The cards are shuffled, as is customary, by the dealer, who divides the pack into two parts. These he holds at the top in each hand, drawing the ends of the cards, which lay side by side, through each other; or, the cards are drawn out near the bottom and put upon the top.
One pack is used in this game and any number may play. The gamekeeper, Moul-tjyou,’? deals a card face down to each player, including himself, always drawing the cards from the bottom instead of from the top. The players have all put down their wagers, which have been covered by corresponding amounts by the Moul-tiyou. The object of the game is to get two or three cards upon which the sum ot the

From Korean Games,
' Yet-pang-mang-i (yet is a ““sweetmeat,” pang-mang-i a ‘‘pestle” or ‘‘club”) is the most popular game. Sometimes the same player holds the bank for three rounds, sometimes for five. The game is a favorite with the Korean sharper, who will abstract an extra card or, if dealer, will place a tjyang and a kou (nine) where they

each wins an amount equal to their stakes from him. When both count alike, neither wins. Three cards having the same number count higher than nine. It will be observed that in this game the suit-marks do not appear to be regarded, and it is to be inferred that the packs of forty and sixty cards, without suit-marks, are used for it.
78. PRACTICE ARROWS.! Korea. Three from a set of five.
The arrows used at the present day in archery (Plate 46). They are called you-yep-tiyen (Chinese, lau tp tsin), ‘willow-leaf arrows,” and are made of bamboo, 34 inches in length. The point is of iron, nail-shaped, with a stop which fits against the fore-shaft. The latter is usually made of cherry wood, with or without the bark on, and is about 14 inches in length. The footing, also of cherry wood, has a cylindrical nock with a U-shaped notch. The feathers, three in number, are carefully and uniformly trimmed and are fastened with glue; on some, in a straight line, and on others, at a slight angle to the shaft. These arrows usually bear the persoual name of the owner, written in Chinese characters, between the feathers. All of these arrows are numbered with Chinese characters, from one to five below the shaftment.?
These arrows are shown to illustrate the probable source of the Korean playing-cards, which, however, doubtless originated long before the art of writing was perfected. It will be observed that the arrows are numbered in sets of five, while the cards are in suits of tens. In the tong-kai, or ceremonial quiver (No. 61), there are ten arrows, however, and the feathers on these arrows have black tips, which seem to be perpetuated in the feather-like marks on the backs of the cards.
79. PLAYING-CARDS.? Kiu Kiang, China.
Nine ecards of the suit of mdn, or ‘‘myriads” (Plate 47), from a set consisting of four packets of thirty cards each, and five jokers: the Five Blessings, Fuk, Luk, Shau, Hi, Ts‘oi, ‘ Happiness, Promotion, Long life, Posterity, and Wealth.” The four packets are like those of the sueceeding cards (No. 80).
It is probable that Chinese playing-cards, of which there are several kinds, take their form from the narrow Korean cards. The cards with money-symbols seem to be in the direct line of descent, if not from cards of which the Korean are survivals, at least from cards of the same character and origin. These particular cards are shown (Plate 47) to illustrate the index-marks on the ends (of common occurrence on the cards of this type), which may be survivals of the numerals on the Korean cards (fig. 220). Mr. Cushing regards these numerals as likely to have been derived from the cut cock feathers of the original arrows. Mr. Wilkinson, on the other hand, considers them to be modifications of Chinese numerals. :

The points are counted, according to certain combinations of two or more cards, which a player may make either with the cards originally dealt him or with three taken up. These combinations are called yaku or “prizes.” They are reckoned as equivalent to one or more kwan of twelve points. The counts are extremely numerous and complicated, and there are several varieties of the game. Fora detailed account consult ‘* Korean Games.”!

While the colors of the grounds of all these cards, with reference to the suit-marks, are practically the same, they differ in this respect from the similar pack in the Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society described by Chatto,' who gives a description of the game, taken from the Caleutta Magazine for 1815,

type. Such is not the case with the following packs in the University Museum, which bear Hindu emblems representing the ten avatars of Vishnu, from which they are known as the dasavatara mulu, or the Game of the Ten Incarnations.
One pack (Cat. No. 19135) consists of one hundred and twenty lac. quered disks of cardboard, 44 inches in diameter, with plain red backs, and faces painted with suit-marks on grounds of different colors. There are ten suits of twelve cards each, consisting of ten numerals and two court-cards. The court-cards bear representations of the ten avatars of Vishnu, one of the two of each suit having a single figure, and the other the same figure in a kind of temple, with two attendants (figs. 221-224), The marks of the numerals are as follows:
. Matsyd, the fish. Fish, black. 2. Kurma, the tortoise. Tortoise, brown. 3. Varah, the boar. Conch, dark green.

Another pack (Cat. No. 19156) in the same musenm, 34 inches in diameter, corresponds in number, the emblems also referring to the ten avatars. The colors and suit marks vary somewhat in order from the preceding.

Fifty-seven cards of a set of sixty. Card-pieces about 24 by 13 inches, consisting of thick lacquered cardboard with black backs. The faces bear pictures painted in colors upon gold-foil, the grounds being of five different colors. These are as follows:
Black: Lion devouring serpent; lion devouring ox; lions and serpent. Three varieties. |
Green: Youth (King) seated. Three varieties.
Yellow: Woman (Queen). Five varieties, in four of which the woman is accompanied by a child.
Gold: Youth; hunter Three varieties.
Red: Dancing-girls. Three varieties.
A pack of Persian playing-cards in the possession of Mrs. C. C. Curtis, of Albion, New York, are identical with the preceding in size and material, but bear somewhat different designs. They number twenty cards, of five different colors, black, yellow (white), red, gold, and green, four of each. There are two cards of each kind, making ten different cards.
Black: Two lions devouring two serpents; lion devouring antelope (Plate 48a, b.) ;
Yellow: King on throne; mother (Madonna?) with child. (Plate 48c, d.)
Red: Lady with child; girl with wineglass and bottle. (Plate 49a, b )
Gold: Two soldiers; lad with dog. (Plate Jc, d.)
Green: Dancing-girls; queen on throne. (Plate 50a, b.)
The first-mentioned cards of each pair agree with those described below by General ‘Schindler. It will be observed that the uniform of the soldiers, that of the English East India Company, precludes the possibility of any high antiquity for these particular cards.*
Gen. A. Houtum Schindler, of Teheran, in reply to a letter of inquiry addressed by the writer, has forwarded the following account of Persian cards:
The old Persian name for these cards was ganjifeh—a word, I think, derived from the Chinese (chi-p‘di—literally, paper-cards, the modern Chinese for playing-cards), with the Persian word ganj— “treasure” prefixed. It may have also been originally Kan-chu-p‘di —cards from Kanchu, in the Kansu province. The word yanjifeh is in Persian now only employed for European playing-cards (four suits, ace to ten; three picture cards each suit), which, however, are also called varak, while the old Persian playing-cards are known as varak i ds—varak i dsands—or simply ds, from the game ds or dsands, which is played with them.

enteenth century we know that a set of ganjifeh cousisted of ninety or ninety-six cards in eight suits or colors. At present a set consists of twenty cards in five colors or values. These values are:
1. Shir va Khurshid or ds: Lion and Sun, or Ace.
2. Shah or Pdédishd: King.
3. Bibi: Lady (or Queen).
4, Sarbdz: Soldier (or Knave).
5. Lakat (meaning something of little value): generally a dancing-girl.
The backs of the cards are always black or of a dark color, but their faces have grounds of different colors, viz: The Lion and Sun, a black ground; the King, a white ground; the Lady, red; the soldier, gold; the Lakat, green. The pictures on the ecards show much variety and are often obscene, particularly those on the card of
_ the lowest value. The ordinary types as now made are: Ace, a Lion and Sun, as in
the Persian arms; a King sitting on a throne; a European lady in a quaint costume; a Persian soldier shouldering his rifle; a Persian dancing-girl. The word ganjifeh I have explained. 4s is no doubt our word ‘‘ace,’ probably introduced into India through the Portuguese Neither of the words is found in Persian dictionaries. The game of As is exactly iike Poker, but without any flushes or sequences. There are four players, and each player gets five cards, dealt to the right. The dealer puts down a stake. The first player then looks at his cards. If he ‘‘goes,” he says didam (I have seen), and covers the stake or raises it. If he does not wish to play, he says nadidam (I have not seen) and throws his cards. He may also “go” without looking at his cards—that is, in poker parlance, “straddle’—and he says nadid didam (not seeing, I have seen). The second player, if he wishes to play, must cover the stakes, and can also raise. The third player and the dealer then act in the same way just as in poker, and when the stakes of all players are equal and no one raises any more the cards are turned up and the player holding the best hand wins the stakes.
The hands in the order of their value are as follows:
Seh va just,i e., three and a pair; a “full.” Sehta, i. e., threes, aces, kings, etc.
Do just, i.e., two pairs; aces highest.
Just, i.e., one pair; aces highest.
When two players have the same pair or pairs, the other cards decide; for instance, a pair of kings, ace, soldier, and lakat,
“Bluffing” is a feature of the game and is called tup zadan; literally, ‘‘fire off a gun.” A bluff is tip.

The origin of European playing-cards is extremely obscure. They are variously regarded as having been invented in Europe, and to have been introduced from the East. Willshire? favors the former view, and assigns the earliest European cards to Italy, while others believe them to have been derived from China, or to have been introduced by the Arabs or Gypsies.”
There are two principal kinds of European cards; one consisting of from thirty-two to fifty-six cards, comprised in four suits, each composed of a series of numeral cards and court or coate-cards, or honours; and another, called Tarots (France) or Tarocchi (Italy), in which the preceding pack is supplemented with twenty-two or more cards called atouts (France) or atutti (Italy), bearing emblematic devices of a mythological or historic character. The earliest, or what are believed to be the earliest, Italian cards are of the latter kind.
There are three varieties of Italian Tarots, according to Willshire: the Tarots of Venice or Lombardy, regarded by him as the parent game; the Minchiate of Florence, and the Tarocchino of Bologna.
The source of the allegorical designs on the cards of the emblematic sequence has been referred to a series of early Italian prints bearing full-length figures illustrating the various conditions of life—the Muses, Arts, Sciences, etec.—which are regarded as having been intended for purposes of instruction rather than for play. These prints, known as the Tarocchi di Mantegna or the Carte di Baldini, exist in several European collections, and are fifty in number, arranged in five series, consecutively numbered (No. 86).

The first is regarded by some as the source of the design on t Matto or Fou of the Tarot series, and the second that of Jl Carro (VI. The resemblance between the emblems testifies either to a descent both compositions from an antecedent or common type, or that the pie No.7 of the old Venetian Tarots is simply a modification of No. 45 the Italian sequence (Willshire).

The fannie are similar to those of the precedi pack (No. 85). The atutti from I to XXV are numbered. Willshire describes the characteristics of the Florentine Minchic as follows:
In place of the twenty-two atutti of the old Venetian sequence there are fort one tarots proper, i.e., nineteen of the older series, or what are equivalent to the and twenty-two additional tarots, including the Matto or Fou. The chief modifi tions of the old Venetian sequence are: the figure of Le Pape (No. V) is withdrawn; Papesse (No. 11) becomes Le Grand Duc; L’ Impératrise (No. II1) and L’? Empereur (2 IV) represent the ‘Emperor of the West” and the ‘‘ Emperor of the East” resp tively; L’ Hermite (No.IX) becomes an old man upon crutches (Le Sablier No. X having behind hima star and above his shoulders an hourglass transfixed by an arro while La Maison Diew ow la Foudre (No. XVI) is discarded, or is perhaps metam phosed into L’Enfer (No. XV), L’ Etoile (No. XVII), La Lune (No. XVIII), Le Sol (No. XIX), and Le Monde (No. XXI) are retained. To this slight modification the old Venetian Tarots are added the three theological virtues, Faith (No. XVII Hope (No. XVI), and Charity (No. XIX). Other additional pieces are: One of t four cardinal virtues, Prudence (No. XVII); the four elements of the ancient philo: phers, as Fire (No. XX), Water (No. XXI), Earth (No. XXII), Air (No. XXIII); t twelve signs of the Zodiac (Nos. XXIV to XXXV); the remainder of the series cc cluding with the Star, the Moon, the Sun, the World, and La Renommeée.
Willshire states that there is a tradition that Minchiate was invent by Michael Angelo to teach children arithmetic.

88. TAROCCHINO. Playing-Cards.! Bologna,’ Italy. Nineteenth century.
Pack of sixty-six cards, comprising forty numeral-cards and twentytwo atutti. The numeral-cards are like those of the preceding packs, except that they are double-headed, instead of having full-length figures, and in that the twos, threes, fours, and fives are suppressed, the latter being the chief characteristic of the Tarocchino. The atutti bear designs copied from a Florentine Minchiate set.
According to Willshire, this modification of the Tarot game was invented at Bologna, early in the fifteenth century, by Francesco Fibbia (Prince of Pisa), an exile in that city, dying there in 1419. The word tarocchino is a diminutive of tarocchi, a name early applied to any game with Tarots.

German Tarot packs, called Tarok, vary greatly in their ornamental and symbolic designs from the Italian cards from which they are manifestly copied.
91. JEU DES 78 TAROTS EGyPTIENS.! Paris,? France. Nineteenth century.
Set of seventy-eight numbered cards, intended for fortune-telling, with designs copied from the Tarot pack. Accompanied by a handbook, entitled Art de Tirer les Cartes.
The use of cards for the purpose of fortune-telling is well known. Indeed, it is the opinion of some authorities that cards were introduced into Europe for the purpose of divination and fortune-telling, by the Gypsies, some time between 1275 and 1325. There is evidence that cards were used for this purpose early in the sixteenth century. According to Willshire, recourse to cards for divinatory purposes gradually declined among the upper classes until the middle of the eighteenth century, though it prevailed, no doubt, among the lowest grades of society frequeuting fairs and the caravans of mountebanks. In 1750, divination with cards again became popular, and at this period, in 1753, a perruquier, named Alliette, who reversed the letters of his name, and called himself Etteilla, superseded the ordinary practice of employing the cards of the pack singly, and substituted the art of reading the mysteries they might unfold when the whole sequence was arranged upon a table.
The emblematic figures of the Tarot pack have been the object of much speculation, and their origin is said to extend back to the ancient Egyptians, from whom they have descended to us as a book or series of subjects of deep symbolic meaning. The discovery and explication of this supposed source and hidden meaning of the Tarots employed in modern times was claimed by M. Court de Gebelin in 1781. He _asserts that the series of seventy-eight Venetian Tarots has an unquestionable claim to be regarded as an Hgyptian book, and that it is based upon the sacred Egyptian number seven. Alliette applied the theories of M. de Gebelin to the use of cards in fortune telling, and numerous packs are made even at the present day to be used in accordance with the system which he formulated.

and Bastoni is the mode in which they are interlaced or connected together in place of standing separately or apart. The curved forms, too, of the Spade, or swords, are specially Italian in design. The designs on cards vary in different parts of Italy. Thus in the south, cards with Spanish marks are used, while the Florentine pack bears French suit-marks. Cards are made at the present day in many of the Italian cities. Hach maker supplies not only those of the local type, but usually those of other cities. Stencils are still used for some of the cheaper cards.!

According to Willshire, there are no marks special to Trappola, it being played with a series of numerals, of which the three, four, five, and six of each suit are suppressed, and as long as this is done it may be played with cards showing no matter what marks of suits. From the circumstances of its being a Venetian game, the original marks ot the suits were naturally the Italian ones.’

honors, her place being supplied by a Caballero or Caballo, The marks are similar to those of Italy, but the Spanish designs differ from the former, as do the figures on the coat-cards. While the Italian kings are seated, the Spanish kings are erect, and their vast mantles are surcharged with large ornaments, as in the case of the French kings. The swords are straight, double-edged rapiers; the batons, knotty branches of trees, and these knotty branches are placed sometimes horizontally, sometimes vertically, close to each other, but always so arranged that they are never interlaced in the manner common to the numeral-eards of the Italian Tarots.

Pack of forty cards painted with native colors upon tanned hide. Four suits of ten cards each, directly copied from the Spanish cards, No. 98, but with the designs of the suit-marks and court-cards modified to accord with native ideas.
Capt. John G. Bourke informed me that the Apache have borrowed many of the words relating to playing-cards, as well as the cards themselves, from the Mexicans. The four suits they call Copas, Escudos, Espadas, and Bastones or Palos. The names of Rey and Sota are the same as in Spanish, but the Caballo is Jliv or “ Horse.” The Ace they call As, but for the other numerals native names are used: Naqui, 2; Taqui, 3; Tingwi, 4; Trosh klay, 5; Custan, 6; Cusetti, 7. “Shuffle” is jli-ka-shi-ache. Captain Bourke says: “I think this means ‘TI take or hunt for the horse Caballo:’ Jli or jliv = horse; ka, abbreviation for daka = card; shi =1, and achi =wish, take, hunt.” Cut is da-na, and cards, daka (carta). Their game they call Con-quien, “with whom?” It is also known by the native name of Daka-cunitsnun =‘ Cards ten.” The Rey or King is also called Inju or Inshu = “Good.”

The kings bear the names of Cesar, Charles, David, and Alexander; the queens, Rachel, Judith, Pallas, and Argine; and the knaves, Lahire, Hector, Hogier, and Lancelot.
The earliest French cards known are said to be those in the Carpentier collection. These cards are fourteen in number, painted by hand about the commencement of the fifteenth century. They bear the same suit-marks as the French cards of the present day. These marks were so persistently maintained and introduced on ecards exported to all countries that a regular type or class of cards became known as French cards, as opposed to Italian cards on the one hand and to German cards on the other.
At first the figure-cards or honors were without names on them, but about the last quarter of the sixteenth century names were attached. French playing-cards having on them the suit-marks, Ceurs, Carreaua, Trefles, and Piques, are often termed Piquet packs. The game of Piquet is one in which, up to the beginning of the eighteenth century, the pack consisted of thirty-six cards, the two, three, four, and five of each suit being suppressed, as in Trappola and the Tarocchino of Bologna. From the date mentioned the six of each suit has been omitted, so the Piquet pack has now but thirty-two cards.
102. SPrEL-KARTEN. Playing-Cards.' Frankfort-on-the-Main,’? Germany. Nineteenth century.
Pack of thirty-six cards of four suits: Herzen, Laub, Eicheln, and Schellen, or “ Hearts,” ‘“‘ Leaves,” ‘‘Acorns,” and “Bells.” The numerals are ace, Six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, the suppression of the two, three, four, and five being a peculiarity of the true German pack. The courteards are the Konig, ‘* King,” and the Obermann and Untermann, superior and inferior valets.
Willshire states that, according to trustworthy authorities, allusion is made to playing-cards in the Pflichtbitcher of Niirnberg for 1384, and there is extant an ordinance of the town council of Ulm for the year 1397 prohibiting their employment. “It is probable,” he says, “that the Germans very soon altered for themselves the Italian marks of the suits, making use of figures of animals for differentiating the latter.” The earliest German cards known have dogs, falcons, stags, and ducks for suit-marks. These “animated” cards were, however, soon followed by a series having the more national signs of Roth or Herzen, Laub or Griin, Hicheln, and Schellen, or Hearts, Leaves, Acorns, and Bells. 103. SPIEL-KARTEN. Playing-Cards.* Leipsic,Germany. ‘La Belle
Alliance.”
Pack of thirty-six cards with German suit-marks, like the preceding. Numerals bear colored pictures of the battle of Leipsic, 1813; the Kings, portraits of the allied sovereigns, and the other court-cards, generals.

The pictures on each pair of cards differ in details from each other.
A similar pack of Hexen-karten in the University Museum,’ probably made in Niirnberg in the seventeenth or early in the eighteenth century, consists of thirty-two cards printed in colors, comprising twelve cards with Roman numerals, printed in black, from I to XII, and two each of the following cards:

The numeral cards are inscribed at the top niéimero, and below the number are pictures of cities, which, upon comparison, prove to be highly conventionalized copies of the pictures of Italian cities on the cards from Bologna. A very complete account of this game is given by K. A. Bierdimpfl,? who states that in Germany the game has different names, that of Heven or “‘ witch” cards being the local name in old Bavaria. The game exists in France under the name of Coucou.

111. IGRALNYE Karty. Playing-Cards.! Russia. Nineteenth Century. Whist pack of fifty-two cards, French suit-marks, and court-cards similar to those of France. The manufacture of playing-cards in Russia is a State monopoly, of which the revenue is applied to the support of the charitable establishment known as the “ Institutions of the Empress Marie.”
112. PLAYING-CARDS.? England.’® Nineteenth century.
Whist pack of fifty two cards. Suits: Diamonds, Hearts, Spades, and Clubs.
According to Willshire, it is probable that cards made their way into England through France. The date of their introduction is not known, but it is believed they were not in use until after the reign of Henry iV (1405), and they were certainly employed previous to 1463. About 1484 they formed a common English Christmas pastime. England appears to have at once adopted the French suit-marks. The English names of the suits, however, are in part of Spanish descent.
113. PLAYING-CARDS.* Philadelphia,’ United States. About 1860. “Club House” (Philadelphia Club). Whist pack of fifty-two cards, ordinary suits; court-cards bear fulllength figures instead of being double-headed. Similar cards are still made for use in certain games.

By Cyrus ADLER, Ph. D., Custodian, Section of Historic Religious Ceremonials, U. S. National Museum, and I. M. Casanowicz, Ph. D. Aid, Division of Historic Archwology, U. S. National Museum.
The Section of Oriental Antiquities in the U. S. National Museum was established in 1887, and in 1889 there was added to the Museum a Section of Religious Ceremonial Institutions. Although not at all identical in scope, it was found best for practical reasons that the exhibit of these two sections in the Atlanta Exposition should be united in the form of a collection which, for want of a better name, may be called Biblical Antiquities. The space allowed was an alcove 20 by 20 feet. All of the subdivisions of this subject were represented, so that there was no possibility of completeness in any direction. Nevertheless, the exhibit had an educational value, as being the first collection put together at an exposition which attempted to show in outline all of the possibilities of study in this most important field.
It has, therefore, seemed proper that a record be made of this collection as it was actually shown at Atlanta, in the order in which it was shown, and without any attempt to fill out the deficiencies which are known to have existed. Such a description will, it is hoped, be of service to teachers and students, and may possibly furnish a suggestion to those who are interested in the establishment of small collections which touch the interests of so many persons, who, without being special students and investigators, are yet deeply concerned in anything that relates to the archeology and history, the ethnology, and the art of that portion of the eastern world around the Mediterranean, to which the culture and civilization of later Europe and even of modern America can in a great degree be traced.
The limitations of space caused some apparent incongruities; nevertheless, it can be said that nothing was shown which did not bear
upon Biblical history and antiquities. 953

MAP OF PALESTINE.—It is not possible to understand the geology, the flora, and fauna of a country, the habits and customs of the people, nor their history, without an idea of the physical features of the country studied. The first object shown, therefore, was a relief map of Palestine. This map is the result of geographical and geological survey work, carried on for more than ten years by experts in the service of the Palestine Exploration Fund. Itis 7 feet 9 inches by 4 feet 1 inch in size and made on the seale of ;g¢a5<5, or three-eighths of an inch to the mile. It embraces the whole of western Palestine, from Baalbec in the north to Kadesh Barnea in the south, and shows nearly all that is known of the country east of the Jordan. The natural features of the country stand out prominently, being reinforced by appropriate colors, The mountains and plains are shaded a creamy white. The seas, lakes, marshes, and perennial streams are shown in blue. The Old and New Testament sites are marked in red. The map thus furnishes a most important aid for the understanding of the Bible narrative.’
No attempt was made to present in systematic form the geology of the country nor to show in any way the features of the soil. The fo!lowing specimens, which possess a sentimental interest merely, were placed in the collection.
Dust FROM JERUSALEM.—Dust from the Holy Land is with many Jews amuch-cherished possession, perhaps suggested by Psalms cil, 14: “For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity upon her dust.” It is sometimes placed in the graves, and is considered as a substitute for actual burial in the Holy Land, which is one of the pious aspirations of the orthodox Jew.
WATER FROM THE JORDAN.—The Jordan is one of the points of attraction for pilgrims to Palestine. As early as the time of Constantine (306 to 337) baptism in the Jordan was deemed a special privilege, on account of its association with John the Baptist and the baptism of Christ;? even now the Oriental Christians attach great importance to the bath in the Jordan, as the termination of a pilgrimage.*
The pilgrims usually fill jars from the river to be used for baptisms at home.
SMALL SHELL (Janthina fragilis) FROM TyRE.—Tyre was in ancient times the wealthiest and most magnificent of Phenician cities. It was situated on the Mediterranean, and consisted of two parts, Palaetyrus on the mainland and Neotyrus on the island. It was famous for the

precious purple dye, which was extensively prepared from the shellfish Murex. Tyre is often mentioned in the Bible under the name of Cor.! The modern Cur, on its site, is an unimportant town of about 5,000 inhabitants.
GRANITE FROM JEBEL MusA.—Jebel Musa (mountain of Moses) is one of the peaks in the southeast of the Sinaitic Monntain range. It rises about 7,000 feet above the sea level, and tradition assigns to it the giving of the Law to Moses. The Sinaitic Mountain chain is formed of granite and porphyry. The quarries and mineral deposits of the Sinaitic Peninsula were worked as early as 3,000 B.C.
The flora, iike the geology of the country, was but inadequately represented, the following specimens being the only ones shown:
SEED PODS OF THE CAROB TREE.—The carob or locust tree (Ceratonia siliqua) is common in Galilee, in the plain of Sharon, and in the countries around the Mediterranean Sea in general. The island of Cyprus alone produces at present about 30,000 tons of carobs, almost the whole of which is exported to England and France, and “this quantity is produced by hardly a third of the carob trees growing in the island, because perhaps the other two-thirds of these trees are not yet gratted.”” Its frnit is a brown pod, from 6 to 12 inches long, about an ineh broad, having a fleshy or mealy pulp, of an agreeable taste, which is not only ground up for cattle and swine, but also extensively used as food by the Arabs, Moors, and Italians. Large quantities of carob are used, especially in France, for distillation, and also for producing a sort of molasses’ The English name is borrowed from the Oriental, probably coming from the Arabic? Harrub through Spanish; it occurs in the Talmud in the form Harub. It is generally assumed that the carob beans represent the ‘* husks,” in the Revised Version “pods of the carob tree,” (in the Greek original xeparzor, keration) in the parable of the Prodigal Son.’ Through a confusion between the pods of the carob tree (also called locust) with the locusts (insects, Greek axpides, akrides) which John the Baptist ate,° it was thought that the pods formed the food of John the Baptist, and they are still commonly called “St. John’s bread.”
SYCAMORE FROM PALESTINE.—The sycamore tree ( Ficus sycomorus), Hebrew shiqmah, is represented in I Kings x, 27, as having been abundantin Palestine in the reign of Solomon: ‘*The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland for abundance,” and similarly we read in

<<<Page: 1254>>>

Isaiah ix, 9,10, “the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.” The sycamore of the Bible has no natural alliance with the maple syeamores of Europe and North America, In flowers and foliage it closely resembles the common fig, but grows to a greater size, sometimes reaching a height of 30 or 40 feet and a diameter of 20 feet. it bears at least two crops annually, but they are small and insipid compared with those of the common fig tree (Ficus carica). Still they are gathered and used as food by the poorer classes. The prophet Amos describes himself as a “dresser of sycamore trees.”' In the Egyptian cult the sycamore was symbolical of the tree of life, being dedicated to Hathor.
APPLES OF Sopom.—The apples of Sodom are considered by some to represent the nightshade (Solanum sanctum) which grows in bushes and thickets in warm regions and especially in the Jordan Valley. It is a shrubby plant, 3 or 4 feet high. Its blossoms resemble in color and form those of the potato, and the fruits are oval-shaped, first of yellow, but when ripe of a beautiful red color. The fruit is said to be turned into dust by the sting of an insect, leaving only the skin intact. Robinson identifies the fruit of the Asclepias gigantea with the apples of Sodom. This fruit resembles a large yellow apple. Externally of fair appearance, it bursts when pressed like a bubble filled with air, leaving only the shreds of a thin skin in the hand. The Orientals describe the Asclepias gigantea as a plant containing an astringent milky juice. (Arabic, Yati. Syriac, Yetia sebe'a helba.’)
UNRIPE POMEGRANATE FROM PALESTINE.—The pomegranate (Punica granatum; Hebrew, Rimmén) is enumerated among the plants characteristic of the promised land,’ though it was not native there; it was and continues to be extensively cultivated in Palestine, and its failure is represented as a special punishment of God.‘ It grows wild in Persia, Afghanistan, and neighboring countries, and has been cultivated from time immemorial along the north and south coasts of the Mediterranean.’
It is still common in Tunis and Algiers, where it is called by* the Arabs riman, corresponding exactly to the ancient Hebrew name. It is a beautiful shrub, with dark and shining leaves and bell-shaped flowers. In the autumn it yields a ruddy fruit about the size of an orange, usually of a reddish tint, filled with a delicious pulp, in which semitransparent seeds lie in rows. It was appreciated for its fruit® and its wine,’ which is made from the fermented juice. Its fruits and flowers were also used in medicine, and the rind for tanning leather. The manufacture of leather by means of it was introduced by the

Moors from Africa into Spain, especially into Cordova, and the leather was hence called “Cordovan.” It is still used in Morocco, the leather of which country retains its superiority, especially for bookbinding. The flowers and fruit of the pomegranate entered into the religious rites and symbolism of the Phenicians and ancient Romans, as well as of the ancient Israelites. The robe of the High Priest had an embroidery of “pomegranates of blue and of purple and of scarlet round about the skirt thereof,”' while the pomegranate also formed a decorative symbol in the columns of the Temple.2 Hehn® says: “ Religious intercourse in ancient times also brought the glorious pomegranate tree to Europe. Its purple blossoms in brilliant foliage and red-cheeked fruit rich in kernels must have from the beginning excited the imagination of the peoples of Western Asia, whose mode of thinking was symbolical. In the Odyssey, among the fruits in the garden of the king of the Pheaks, and among those that torment by their sight, the Phrygian Tantalus are also the pomegranates jozo/ (rhoisi), which name in itself bears decisive testimony to the origin of the plant in Semitic language and culture.” “The name of the pomgranate fruit among the Portuguese is to the present day the Arabic roma, romeira.”
CONE OF THE CEDAR OF LEBANON.—The cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus libani, Hebrew Hrez) has its chief habitat in the ranges of the Taurus and Lebanon, the latter being its southernmost limit. The Old Testament abounds in references to the cedar of Lebanon. It was considered as the prince of trees, the emblem of all that ‘is grand, maguificent, and durable: “The glory of Lebanon;> the trees of the Lord are satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted ;”° “the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.”* Frequent references are also made to the economic uses of the cedar. It supplied the chief material for the woodwork of the temple of Solomon and the royal palaces,’ the second temple of Zerubbabel,? and according to Josephus! was also used in the rebuilding of the teriple by Herod. From the Assyrian inscriptions it is learned that the Assyrian kings procured the costly woods for their buildings from the Lebanon. Cedar timber was also used in the great Persian edifices at Persepolis, in the first temple of Diana at Ephesus, and that of Apollo at Utica, where the age of the cedar timber was computed at two thousand years. At present the forest of Lebanon

“is shorn of its glory,” and only between 400 and 500 cedar trees are found in small groups in various parts of the mountain range, most of them in the valley of Kadisha, nearly 7,000 feet above the sea. The tree is still called by the Arabs Arz, identical with the ancient Hebrew name.!
CoNE OF A LEBANON FIR.—The Hebrew word? Berosh, which is rendered by the English version “fir,” probably comprises the other coniferous trees of Palestine, including junipers, pines, and the funeral cypress. Of the pine there are four species in Palestine. The most common is the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), then the pinaster (P. pinaster), the stone (P. pinea), and the Pyrenean (P. pyrenaica). The Juniperus excelsa is very common, and the Cypressus sempervirens is the common species of western Asia and southern Europe. ‘Fir trees” are frequently referred to in the Old Testament in association with cedars of Lebanon, though the former were deemed inferior: ‘Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen.”* “Fir” timber was used for the floors of the temple, for ships’ planks,’ and for musical instruments.’ The fruit is but once mentioned: “Iam like a green fir tree; from me is thy fruit found.”?
Though for obvious reasons no attempt was made at a compete collection of the fauna of the Bible, a sufficient number of specimens was shown from each class to make the exhibit of this division of the natural history of the Bible in some measure representative.
The mammals were illustrated by the following specimens:
THE APE® (Hanuman monkey, Semnopithecus entellus ; Hebrew, Qof).— The ape was not native in Palestine. It is mentioned in the Bible among the commodities brought to Solomon by the ships of Tarshish.’ The Hebrew name for ape is cognate with that in the Tamil language (Kapi), and it is therefore assumed that the apes were brought from Ceylon or South India, where the genus Semnopithecus is especially frequent. The ape has also been identified among the animals depicted on the Assyrian monuments.
THE BAT (Hebrew, Atallef).—The bat is classed in the catalogue of animals!’ among the unclean birds, which sees or DisGee for food. In

<<<Page: 1257>>>

Isaiah ii, 20, 21, bats are alluded to in company with moles as inhabiting holes and cavities about ruins; “In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold which they made for him to worship, to the moles and to the bats to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks.” Bats are still very numerous in Palestine, about twenty species being known. One of the most common is Cynonycteris cegyptiaca, a Specimen of which was shown.
‘““CONEY”-ROCK-BADGER (Procavia syriaca, or Hyrax syriacus ; Hebrew, Sha/an).—In the English versions of the Bible the Hebrew Shafan is rendered “ coney,” which formerly was the common name for rabbit, although that usage is now obsolete. It is well known that the introduction of the rabbit into the East is of recent date, and that no rabbit was known to the ancient inhabitants of Bible lands.' Besides, while the rabbit has its dwelling piace in sand or clay, the Shafan is enumerated in the Bible’ among the “four things little upon earth, but exceeding wise, being but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rock,” and their attachment to rocks is also referred to in Psalms civ, 18: “The rocks are refuge for the shefanim.” The animal mentioned in these passages can not, therefore, have been a rabbit, and it is now assumed by all writers to be the Procavia or Hyrax syriacus, which belongs to an isolated group of hoofed mammals whose dentition manifests considerable similarity to the teeth of the rhinoceros. The hyrax is not as common in Palestine as formerly, but it is still found in some places, as in the gorge of the Kedron, on the west side of the Dead Sea, while at the summit of Jebel Musa, on Mount Sinai, a whole colony is in existence. The Arabs call the hyrax wabr, and describe it as the “little animal of the children of Israel” (janamu bani Israil) In Abyssinia the hyrax is called gehejat, and its flesh is there used as food by the Mohammedans.t The Israelites counted it among the unclean animals.”
YOUNG CAMEL (Camelus dromedarius, Hebrew Gamal).—The camel was, and is still, one of the most useful beasts in Palestine. It is referred to in the Bible as being used for riding," as a beast of burden,’ and of draft.° It was also used in war. Among Jacob’s gifts te Esau were thirty milch camels (literally, “‘camels giving suck”) with their colts.” The flesh of the camel was forbidden as food.'' It is eaten now when better food can not be had in most parts of the East; but the meat is

said to be very coarse and dry. The meat of avery young camel, however, is esteemed by the Arabs as a great luxury. The camel had many uses in the arts. Camel’s hair was used for weaving into cloth. John the Baptist “had his raiment of camel’s hair.”' Tents, shields, harness, saddles, and even trunks are made of camel’s skin. Two species, the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) and the Bactrian two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus), were known in Palestine, the former being more frequent. The camel was the subject of many proverbial expressions, two of which are by Jesus, Matthew xix, 24: “Itis easier fora camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,” and xxiii, 24: “Strain out the gnat and swallow the camel.” The word for camel is practically the same in most ancient and modern languages.
GAZELLE (Gazella dorcas; Hebrew, Vebi).—The gazelle (in the Authorized Version “roebuck,” also translated ‘‘roe” in the Revised Version) was allowed as food.” It was provided for the royal table of Solomon. The characteristics of swiftness and gentleness of these animals are often referred to‘ ‘as light of foot as a wild roe;”° “as swift as the roes upon the mountains;”® “The voice of my beloved; behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.”*? The feminine form, in Hebrew (Vebiah, in Aramean Tabitha, was often used as a proper name;® for example, ‘«Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas.” The Arabs call the gazelle tabi and employ it frequently in their love peetry as the image of feminine loveliness. More than twenty species of gazelle inhabit Africa, Arabia, Persia, India, and central Asia. The gazelle of Syria, Egypt, and Arabia is the Gazella dorcas. It is very common in Palestine, especially in the Judean wilderness and the Arabah.
MousE (Hebrew, Akbar).—The mouse is enumerated among the unclean “creeping things,”® ‘eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse.” Mice were sent as a plague upon the Philistines for having carried off the Ark of the Covenant." No less than twenty species have been found in Palestine. The Mus bactrianus, which is especially plentiful and familiar, was given as an illustration.
The birds enumerated in the Bible were represented by fourteen specimens.

denial of Jesus, when Jesus said to Peter, ‘‘The cock shall not crow this day until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.”! It is said that in remembrance of the crowing of the cock, which brought Peter to a sense of his guilt, the practice began of placing weathercocks upon towers and steeples.’
There is independent testimony from the Mishna that the cock had become common in Palestine. The Mishna was collected about 200 of the Christian era, but as many portions of it go back to at least three centuries earlier it is in some portions contemporary with and even earlier than the New Testament. According to the Mishna’® the Jews were prohibited from selling a white cock to the heathens. This prohibition was compromised by the permission to sell if the toe were cut off, because ‘they do not sacrifice anything defective.” The word for cock is “ Tarnegol,” Syriac Tarnagla. There is no Biblical Hebrew word for cock. In addition to the above the Talmud uses the word Geber, which means simply ‘‘ male.” The crowing of the cock is referred to a number of times in the Talmud, cock crow being a recognized time.‘ There are three that are strong (unyielding), says the Talmud, * Israel among the peoples; the dog among the beasts, and the cock among the birds.” (Bega 5b.)
On Babylonian gems the cock appears as the herald of dawn, the heavenly guardian of light, who by his crowing drives away the demons of the night. The native country of the domestic cock is supposed to be India, and the migration of domestic fowl to western Asia and Kurope probably took place with the Medo-Persian conquerors. As the Persians spread their dominions, the cock, the “Persian bird” went with them.
TURTLEDOVE (Turtur risorius; Hebrew, Tor).—The turtledove and the dove or pigeon (Hebrew, Yonah) are very frequently mentioned in the Bible. They were the only birds permitted as sacrifices... Noah sent forth a dove three times from the ark. On its second flight it returned with an olive leaf,® which has since been regarded as the emblem of peace. Numerous allusions are made in the Scriptures to the simplicity, innocence, gentleness, and fidelity of the dove:? “‘ Kphraim is like a silly dove without understanding.”® “Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.” The turtledove is noted for the regularity of its migration: “And the turtle and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming,” compare Canticles ii, 11,12. At present there are four species of dove and three species of turtledove inhabiting Palestine in large numbers.
GOLDEN EAGLE (Aquila chrysaétos ; Hebrew, Nesher).—The Hebrew

<<<Page: 1260>>>

term Nesher, which in the English Bible is invariably rendered “eagle,” comprises large birds of prey in general, and perhaps particularly the griffon vulture. The golden eagle is quite common in Palestine. At least seven other distinct kinds have been observed. Numerous references are found in the Bible to the characteristics of the eagle: Its high soaring in the air;' its molting, as a symbol of the renewing of strength;” its strength;* its predatory habits;* its power of vision ;° its care for its young, in comparison with God’s sheltering care over his people.’ The eagle, as emblematic of the divine attributes, is one of the four living creatures in the vision of Ezekiel (i, 10) and in the Apocalypse of John (iv, 7). It is also the emblem of John the Evangelist.
Hoopokg (Upupa epops; Hebrew, Dukifath).—It is probable that the Hebrew name dukifath, occurring in the list of unclean birds,’ denotes the hoopoe, as the Revised Version translates it, and not the ‘‘lapwing,” as rendered by the Authorized Version. The hoopoe feeds on insects in dunghills and marshy places, and is therefore considered a very filthy bird. It is very common in Egypt, where it is found throughout the winter. In Palestine it is a summer visitor. The Egyptians considered the hoopoe as symbolical of gratitude, because it repays the early kindness of its parents in their old age by trimming their wings and bringing them food when they are acquiring new plumage. The Arabs call it the “doctor,” believing it to possess marvelous medicinal qualities, and they use its head in charms and incantations.
Owu.—Various Hebrew names are assigned by the English Version to different species of owl—Yanshu/, Leviticus xi, 17; Deuteronomy xiv, 16, “great owl;” Kos, in the same passage, “little owl.®
The owl belonged to the unclean birds, and is enumerated among the animals inhabiting deserted and dismal places.2 The Egyptian eagle owl (Bubo ascalaphus) and the little owl (Athene glaux) are the most common species in Palestine. The latter known by the name of Boomeh
1Tsaiah xl, 31: ‘‘They shall mount up with wings as eagles.” Jeremiah xlix, 16, etc.
2«*Thy youth is renewed like the eagle.”—Psalms ciii, 5.
3 Hosea viii, 1: ‘‘As an eagle he cometh against the house of the Lord.”
4 Job ix, 26: ‘“‘As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey. Compare Proverbs xxx, 17; Matthew xxiv, 28.
5 Job xxxix, 28, 29: ‘She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there upon the crag of the rock and the strong hold. From thence she spieth out the prey; her eyes behold it afar off.”
‘Deuteronomy xxxii, 11: ‘“‘As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, that fluttereth over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bare them on his pinions.”
7Deuteronomy xiv, 18; Leviticus xi, 19.
S’These names are disputed; some translate Yanshuf by ‘“‘ water fowl;” Kos by peliean, or falcon. Lilith (Isaiah xxxiv, 14), which is rendered in the Authorized Version by screech owl, in all probability means simply a specter. It is rendered in the Revised Version ‘‘ night monster.”
9Psalms cii, 6: ‘‘I am become as an owl of the waste places.”

<<<Page: 1261>>>

among the Arabs, is also called the “mother of ruins,” as no ruin or tomb of pretension will readily be found without one. This species is a great favorite with the Arabs, being regarded as lucky and friendly to man.
PARTRIDGE (Caccabis chucar, Hebrew Qore).—Reference is made to the partridge in Samuel xxvi, 20, “as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains,” and in Jeremiah xvii, 11, as the partridge (margin of Revised Version “sitteth on eggs which she hath not laid,”) ‘ gathereth young which she hath not brought forth,” alluding to the ancient belief that the partridge was in the habit of stealing eggs and hatching them. Besides the chucar partridge, Hey’s sand partridge (Amnoperdix heyt) is abundant in Palestine and in Sinai.
PEaAcock (Pavo cristatus ; Hebrew, Tukkiyim).—The peacock is mentioned among the animals brought by Solomon’s ships from Tarshish.' It-is an Indian bird, and the Hebrew name can be traced to the Tamil tokei Malabar tégai, toghai, “the crested bird.” In some parts of India it is very abundant and almost domesticated. It is venerated by the Hindus, and large flocks are kept at their temples. It made its appearance in Greece in the middle of the fifth century B. C., and was adopted at Samos as the sacred bird of Hera (Juno) at the temple of that goddess, the Herzeum.
PELICAN ( Pelecanus onocrotalus ; Hebrew, Qa’ath).—The pelican is one of the unclean birds,? being regarded as an emblem of desolation and ruin.® From the habit of this bird of storing quantities of food in the large pouch attached to its lower mandible, for the purpose of feeding its young, which it does by pressing its beak against its breast, the fable arose that the pelican opened its breast with its beak and fed its young with its own blood, which seemed to derive support from the red tips at the end of the bill. Besides the common white pelican another species, the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), is found, but less commonly, on the coast of Syria.
QUAIL (Coturnix communis ; Hebrew, Selav).—Quails are mentioned in the Bible only in connection with the miraculous supply of food which they formed for the Israelites upon two occasions, in the wilderness of Sin‘ and at Kibroth Hataavah.’ They are the smallest representatives of the partridge family and breed in numbers in Palestine. They arrive in vast flocks by night in March and a few remain throughout the winter. Their flesh is considered a delicacy.
RAVEN (Corvus corax; Hebrew, Oreb).—The raven is the first bird mentioned by name in the Bible:® “And he sent forth a raven, and it
'T Kings x, 22; II Chronicles ix, 21.
2 Leviticus xi, 18; Deuteronomy xiv, 17.

§ Genesis viii, 7.

<<<Page: 1262>>>

went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.” It was forbidden for food.!. In several passages the raven is referred to as illustrating the care with which God watches over his creatures.” ‘He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which ery.” ‘¢Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of meat.”* ‘Consider the ravens, that they sow not, neither reap; which have no store chamber nor barn; and God feedeth them; of how much more value are ye than the birds.” The custom of the ravens of attacking the eyes of young or sickly animals is alluded to in Proverbs xxx, 17: “The eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.” The raven and allied species are abundant in Palestine.
SPARROW (Passer domesticus ; Hebrew, Qippor).—The Hebrew word cippor denotes birds in general, being used especially, however, of small birds. In the following passages it appears to refer to the sparrow in particular: Psalm lxxxiv, 3: “The sparrow hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young;” and Psalms cii, 7: “I watch, and become like a sparrow that is alone upon the house top.” Jesus refers to the sparrow in illustration of God’s benignant care of his creatures:° “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.”® Several species of the sparrow occur in great abundance in Palestine, especially on the Plain of Gennesareth.
BLACK Stork (Ciconia nigra; Hebrew, Hasidah).—The stork was accounted an unclean bird.’ It is a migrant,’ “Yea, the stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times,” and built its nest in “the fir trees.”° The Hebrew name Hasidah means the kind, the pious one (Latin, pia avis), owing to the filial piety and devotion which was attributed by the ancients to this bird.
The passage in Job xxxix, 13: “The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth, but her pinions and feathers are kindly (Hebrew, hasidah)” is thought to contain an allusion to the stork, whose treatment of the young is so different from that of the hard-breasted ostrich.”
Owing to this belief and to its feeding on noxious reptiles and insects

<<<Page: 1263>>>

the stork is a protected bird, and in parts of Europe and the East there is a heavy fine for molesting either the storks or their nests. Both the black and the white stork (Ciconia alba) occur in Palestine, the latter chiefly in winter; the former a migrant, passing to the north.
SwaLLow (Chelidon rustica; Hebrew, Sis, Sus, and Deror).—The swallow is referred to in Jeremiah viii, 7, as one of the birds which ‘observe the time of their coming.” ‘As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying, so the curse that is causeless lighteth not.”!_ Psalms, Ixxxiv, 3: “ Yea, the sparrow hath found her an house and the swallow a nest for herself.” There are about half a dozen species of the swallow, and the closely allied martin, in Palestine. The common swallow abounds in the Mosque of Omar.
GRIFFON VULTURE (Gyps fulvus).—ASs was stated above under eagle, the Hebrew Nesher, which is rendered in the English Bible ‘‘eagle” comprises large predatory birds in general. Thus in Jeremiah xlix, 16, and Job xxxix, 27-30, the ‘‘eagle” is referred to as making its nest in the highest cliffs. ‘O, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill; though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord”: ‘Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong hold.” This is especially characteristic of the griffon vulture. The passage in Micah i, 16; ‘‘Make thee bald * * * enlarge thy baldness as the eagle” can only refer to the vulture, which is devoid of true feathers on the head and neck. The griffon vulture is most abundant in Palestine. It breeds in colonies of aeries, the most notable of which are at Wady Kelt near Jericho, Mount Nebo, in the gorges of the Jabbok and the Litany River, at Mount Carmel, and in the valleys leading into the Plain of Genessareth.
But four specimens of the reptiles of the Bible were exhibited.
FRoG (Hebrew, (efarde a).—The frog is only mentioned in the Old Testament as the second plague inflicted on Egypt.? In Revelations xvi, 13, unclean spirits are spoken of as being in the likeness of frogs, which come out of the mouth of the dragon. The edible frog (Rana esculenta) is the only species which at present occurs in Egypt. In Palestine are found the green toad (Bufo viridis), and less commonly the African toad (Bufo regularis). The little tree frog (Hyla arborea) is also common in Sinai and Palestine.
LIZARD.—Leviticus xi, 30, mentions the names of a number of animals which are included among the creeping things that creep upon the earth. The Letaah (Lacerta viridis and L. agilis) is the only one traditionally rendered by lizard; but the present opinion is that the other names
1 Proverbs xxvi, 2; compare Isaiah xxxviii, 14. ? Exodus viii, 2-14; compare Psalms lxxvii, 45; cv, 30.

<<<Page: 1264>>>

are also kinds of lizards—the Revised Version furnishes this statement in the margin and translates great lizard, lizard, sand lizard, ete. The best lexicographical authority agrees with this view. Nor are we to be surprised at this number of words in Hebrew for lizard, since they are very abundant in Palestine, about forty species having been enumerated. Among the most common is the green lizard and its varieties.
VIPER (Vipera aspis; Hebrew, Hf eh).—The generic name in Hebrew of any serpent is Nahash. The serpent is first mentioned in Genesis iii, 1, 13, where it is said to be more subtle than all the beasts of the field. Jesus alludes to the wisdom of the serpent,' ‘“ Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.” The different species are referred to by various names—pethen, shefifon, ‘akshub, and gif oni, usually rendered by adder. The viper is mentioned in Isaiah xxx, 6; lix, 5; Job xx, 16: “The viper’s tongue shall slay him,” and often in the New Testament.” It is assumed that the viper that fastened on the hand of the Apostle Paul* was the Vipera aspis. Upward of thirty species have been found in Palestine.
Six specimens of the insects of the Bible concluded the illustration of the Biblical fauna.
HORSEFLY (Hippobosca equina; Hebrew, Arob).—It is probable that the horsefly is meant by arob (English versions, ‘swarms of flies,” ‘‘divers sorts of flies”), sent as a plague upon Egypt. The rendering, ‘sswarms of flies,” as indicating a mixture of various insects, is very old, being found in the Talmud and in Jerome. The horsefly in Egypt eine on the human body, sucks blood, and produces festering sores. It is also the means of spreading Gplehaimne
BREEZE FLIES (Heematopota plurialis and Chrysops-coecutiens, Hebrew Zebub).—The name Zebub occurs but twice in the Old Testament, Isaiah vii, 18, as a figure of swarming and troublesome armies coming from Egypt, ‘‘The Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria;” and Keclesiastes x, 1, as corrupting ointment, ‘‘Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth a stinking savor; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.” <A species of Tabanus or breeze fly is common in the valleys of the Jordan and the Nile, and is very injurious to animals; it attacks both man and beast.°
The Phenicians invoked against the flies Baalzebub,° the lord of flies, the god of Ekron.'

SACRED SCARABAEUS (Ateuchus sacer).--The Ateucius was worshiped by the ancient Egyptians, and often represented by hiero-
glyphics and on monuments. Models of them in the most precious materials were worn as charms and buried with mummies. The insects themselves have also been found in coffins. It may be that the worship of the searabaeus in Egypt was in some way connected with that of Baalzebub, the lord of flies, in Ekron.!
Hornet (Vespa orientalis; Hebrew, Gir ah).—Hornets are spoken of in the Bible as an instrument in God’s hands for the punishment and expulsion of the Canaanites.’ “I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.”* It is assumed by some that they are used figuratively for panic or terror. Hornets are abundant in Palestine, and were so in former times, aS is perhaps indicated from the name of the city in Judah, Core’ah, ‘place of hornets.” There are at present four species in Palestine; the most common is Vespa orientalis.
Locust (Acridium peregrinum; Hebrew, Arbeh).—Of all the “creeping creatures” the locust is most frequently mentioned in the Bible. It occurs under nine different names: (hagab, hargol, solam, gazam, yeleq, hasil, geb or gob, gelacgal), which probably denote different species. Locusts were one of the ten plagues inflicted on Egypt. They were permitted as food, and were the chief food of John the Baptist.® Among the Moorish Arabs they are held in high esteem as a stimulant, and in Central Arabia they are regarded as a dainty. Their appearance, habits, ravages, etc., are often referred to figuratively in the Scriptures as destructive armies, Nahum iii, 15-17: ‘“‘Make thyself many as the locusts. * * * Thy crowned are as the locusts and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are:”* ‘And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war * * *,” etc. In Proverbs xxx, 27, they are enumerated among the “four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise.” ‘The locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands.”
Moru (Hebrew, Ash, Sas)—The destructiveness of the moth and its own extreme frailty are often referred to in the Bible as an illustration of the perishable nature of temporal things.® ‘Behold they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.”° ‘Lay not up for

yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth consume * * * 1 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.”? ‘Whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth,” and “He buildeth his house as the moth.”? It is quite plain that at least in most of the passages the Tineidae, or clothes moths, are referred to.
The next group consisted of a selection of objects from the antiquities and art of the peoples who were connected with the history told in the Scriptures. They were put on exhibition for the purpose of enabling the student or visitor to place himself in the position of one who lived in the times and the lands in which the books of the Bible were composed.
Of monuments and relics found in Palestine itself, the following were shown:
Cast OF THE MOABITE STONE.—In II Kings iii it is related that Mesha, the king of Moab, paid tribute to the kings of Israel, but that after the death of Ahab he rebelled. Thereupon Ahab’s son, Joram, allied with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, invaded Moab and shut up Mesha in Kir-Hareseth, situated a little to the east of the southern end of the Dead Sea. Mesha, in this emergency, offered his first born son as a Sacrifice, in the presence of the invading army, to Chemosh, the principal divinity of the Moabites; whereupon the Israelites withdrew. Thus far the Biblical account.
In 1868 the Rev. A. F. Klein, a German missionary, discovered at Dhiban, the ruins of Dibon, the ancient capital of Moab,’ a stone or stela with an inscription celebrating the achievements of Mesha. It was of dark blue basalt, 3 feet 84 inches high, 2 feet 34 inches wide, and 1 foot 1.78 inches thick, rounded at both ends and inscribed with thirty-four lines. The stone was in possession of the Beni Humaydah, a wild Arab tribe east of the Jordan. The Arabs, considering the stone so eagerly sought after by Europeans to be possessed of supernatural power, lit a fire under it and then threw cold water upon it, breaking it into fragments, Which were distributed as charms among the different families of the tribe. M. Clermont Ganneau, at that time chancellor of the French consulate, had, previous to the breaking of the stone, been so fortunate as to obtain a paper impression of the entire inscription. Afterwards by careful work he succeeded in collecting most of the fragments, so that six-sevenths of the inscription has been preserved and two-thirds of the stone itself is now in the Louvre at Paris.
In the inscription Mesha relates that Omri and Ahab had oppressed the land of Moab for many years, until he recovered several cities from
1 James v, 2. 3 Job xxvii, 18. 2 Job iv, 18, 19. 4Nuimbers xxi, 30; xxxii, 34; Isaiah xy, 2.

<<<Page: 1267>>>

the Israelites, mentioning Medeba,' Ataroth,’ and Nebo,’ where he slew 7,000 peopie and captured Jahaz, which had been built by the King of Israel. At the conclusion he also mentions a battle against Horonaim, which is generally interpreted as referring to a successful war with the Edomites who might have invaded the country from the south. It will thus be seen that the contents of this comparatively brief historical document add considerably to our knowledge of the happenings in the ancient world in the ninth century B.C. The dialect of the inscription differs but slightly from Hebrew, and the characters employed are those of ancient Hebrew, the so-called Samaritan or Phenician. Aside from its historical interest just mentioned, the Moabite stone is the most important surviving relic of the Moabite civilization. It is the oldest monument bearing a Semitic inscription, and its discovery was of great importance for the history of the development of the alphabet, proving, as it does, that the Greeks added nothing to the alphabet which they received from the East.*
CAST OF THE SILOAM INSCRIPTION.—The pool or fountain of Siloam, Hebrew, Shiloah, i. e., “sending,” is mentioned in Isaiah viii, 6; “the waters of Shiloah that go softly”? where Jesus sends a blind man to wash in the pool ‘and he came seeing.” It is at the southeast end of Jerusalem and was fed by the waters of a spring of the Gihon, the modern fountain of the Virgin, with which it is connected by a winding tunnel, cut for a distance of 1,708 feet through the solid rock.
The Siloam inscription was accidentally discovered in June, 1880, by a schoolboy, who, while playing with other boys near the pool of Siloam and wading up a channel cut in the rock which leads into. the pool, slipped and fell into the water. On rising to the surface he noticed what looked like letters on the wall of the channel; this fact he reported to Mr. Schick, the well-known architect and archeologist of Jerusalem. Mr. Schick announced the discovery to the German Palestine Exploration Society (Deutscher Palaestina Verein), and with much labor made copies during the winter of 1880-81, which were sent to Europe. Owing, however, to the fact that the characters had become filled with a deposit of lime these copies were practically unintelligible.®
‘Numbers xxi, 30; Joshua xiii, 9, ete. *Numbers xxxii, 34; Joshua xvi, 2, ete. 3Numbers xxxii, 3; Isaiah xv, 2, ete. ‘The inscription has been translated by Noeldeke, Ginsburg, Ganneau, Schlottmann, W. Hayes Ward, Wright, Smend, and Socin, Die Inschrift des Koenigs Mesa vou Moab, Freiburg, 1886, and Canon Driver, Notes on tne Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel, with an Introduction on Hebrew Paleography, and the Ancient Versions and Facsimiles of Inscriptions, Oxford and New York, 1890, pp. Ixxxiv-xciv ; compare also A. H. Sayce, Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments, p. 91.
5Nehemiah iii, 15, and John ix, 7.
6A curious controversy has arisen as to the eredit for the work of lowering the level of the water in the channel to render the inscription accessible. Dr. Guthe, in the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlindischen Gesellschaft, XXXVI, p. 726, claims that it was done at the expense of the German Palestine Exploration Society ; while the same claim is made for the London Palestine Exploration Fund. Quarterly Statement, 1881, p. 142; 1882. p. 1.

<<<Page: 1268>>>

The first legible copies were made by Prof. A. H. Sayce, who came to Jerusalem in February, 1881. He spent three afternoons in the tunnel, sitting in water 4 to 6 inches deep, the conduit being dimly lighted by a candle held by his companion, Mr. Slater.'| Another copy was independently made by the Rev. W. T. Pilter.
In March, 1881, Dr. Guthe, head of the German Palestine Exploration Society, went to Jerusalem, and after making as exact a drawing as possible of the inscription as it stood, he removed the lime deposit by the application of hydrochloric acid. This rendered feasible the taking of an adequate impression of the inscription. Squeezes and plaster impressions were subsequently made by Dr. Guthe, Lieuts. ° Claude R. Conder and Mantel.”
In 1891 the Siloam inscription was cut out of its place in the tunnel and carried away. It was found in the house of a Greek living near Jerusalem on the Hebron road, and the fact reported to the authorities at Constantinople. The Turkish law makes all monuments public property, and the minister of public instruction ordered the inscription sent to Constantinople. So important, however, was the matter deemed that it was considered at a council of ministers, and a peremptory telegram was sent by the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Jerusalem to use all means to secure possession of this priceless monument and forward it with dispatch to the capital.’ This action had the desired . result and the Siloam inscription is now preserved at the Imperial Museum in Constantinople.
The contents of the inscription, which consists of six lines, are as follows: ‘‘Behold the excavation! And this was the manner of the excavation, while of the excavation the excavators struck, each so as to meet his fellow, pick against pick, and there flowed the water from the source to the pool through the space of 1,000 cubits, and * * * ecubit was the height of the rock over the head of the excavation.”
The inscription would seem to show that the work of excavation was undertaken simultaneously from both ends by two gangs of workmen, and that for want of engineering skill the borings overlapped.
Judging by the form of the letters the inscription must have originated between the eighth and sixth centuries. The most generally accepted opinion is, that it dates from the reign of Hezekiah, and is. referred to in II Chronicles xxxii, 4 and 30: ‘So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, why should

the kings of Assyria come and find much water?” and “This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper springs of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the City of David.” It is certainly one of the oldest known Hebrew inscriptions.'
CAST OF THE LACHISH TABLET.—Lachish was one of the capitals of the Canaanites, situated southeast of Jerusalem, between Gaza and Eleutheropolis. It was conquered by Joshua.’ The Assyrian King Sennacherib besieged it during his invasion of Judah, 701 B. C.,’ and, according to the Assyrian inscriptions, captured it. An interesting Assyrian relief represents Sennacherib seated on a throne receiving the tribute of his captives and vassals, accompanied by an inscription containing the statement that the decree was enacted at Lachish. Later on it succumbed to Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of ancient Lachish, now called Tell el-Hesy, have been explored during the last few years by the Palestine Exploration Fund, and in 1892 Dr, F. Jones Bliss, an American archeologist in charge of the work, discovered there a small clay tablet, inscribed’ with cuneiform characters, and in a Semitic dialect akin to the Aramaic. The inscription dates before the conquest of Palestine by the Israelites, and contains a letter from the chief of the territory adjojning Lachish, probably to the governor of Lachish, complaining that marauders from the neighboring region are besetting Atim, which is probably identical with Etam, in the south of Judah, mentioned in I Chronicles iv, 32, and Samhi or Sam’a, now probably represented by the large ruin of Sam’ah, 5 miles to the south of Etam. The original is now in possession of the Turkish Government.
CAST OF THE SEAL OF HAGGAI, SON OF SHEBANIAH.—The original seal of black stone was found in 1857 by Sir Charles Warren, near the Haram-esh-Sherif, the mosque of Omar on the site of the temple at Jerusalem.’ ‘The names Haggai and Shebaniah, which the seal bears, have not been identified. They are possibly connected with the rebuilding of the temple after the exile.
The use of seals or signet rings is already mentioned in the Patriarchal epoch.’ The seal was either hung on a string around the neck
1K. J. Pilcher, in the Proceedings of the Biblical Archeology Society, XIX, pp. 165182, would place the Siloam inscription as late as the time of Herod I (47-4 B.

BIBLICAL WEIGHTS.—The weights (like the measures) of the Hebrews are usually traced to the Babylonian system, which is considered the parent of other oriental systems. The unit of the Hebrew weights was the shekel; the other weights were either its multiples or fractions. The weights mentioned in the Bible are as follows: Talent® (kikkar), equals 60 minas or 3,600 shekels, equal to about 674,000 grains Troy; mina® (maneh), equals 60 shekels, equal to about 11,000 grains Troy; shekel (sheqel), equal to about 220 grains, one-twentieth (gerah) of a shekel,’ or about 11 grains.’ Scales, mo’znayim, consisted of a beam resting at its central point on a standard, and having suspended from its two ends two scales or basins in which the weights and the substances to be weighed were placed respectively. Alongside of the moznayim there is also mentioned peles,'!” which is assumed to answer to the modern steelyard, also called Roman balance or beam, consisting of a lever in the form of a slender iron bar with one arm very short, the other divided by equidistant notches, having a small cross piece as a fulcrum to which a bearing for suspension is attached, usually a hook at the short end, and a weight moving upon the long arm. The weights themselves were called in the Hebrew “ stones,” rendered “ weights” in the English versions.
CAST OF AN ANCIENT HEBREW WEIGHT.—The original, which is of hematite, was obtained by Dr. Th. Chaplin, in Samaria. The weight is spindle shaped, somewhat flattened on one side, and weighs about 40 grains. It has on both sides a Hebrew legend, which is interpreted to mean ‘ Quarter of a quarter of neceg,” which may have been a standard weight in Palestine.!!

CAST OF A BEAD.—The original, a reddish perforated yellow stone, was obtained by Prof. T. F. Wright, in Jerusalem. It weighs 134 grains, and is inscribed with the word neceg in the same characters as those of the Siloam inscription. It was probably used as a weight, and the inscription may mean “standard weight.” !
As of great general interest for the history of culture there was shown a collection of musical instruments mentioned in the Bible, supplemented by photographs and casts of representations of musical instruments on ancient monuments. Scarcely any authentic information is preserved concerning the shape or the manner of playing on the musical instruments named in the Bible. The instruments exhibited were such as are now in use in the Oriental countries. But it may be assumed that the musical instruments of the Hebrews resembled those of the nations with which they came in contact, and that, considering the stability and conservatisin of the East, the instruments still used in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt differ but little, if at all, from those employed in ancient times.
It is well known that music occupies an important place in the Bible. Its invention is recorded in the opening chapters of the Scriptures, where Jubal is named as the “father (i. e., founder) of all such as handle the harp and pipe.”” From the earliest times music was of high importance among the Israelites, accompanying all the great national events and adorning the festal occasions. The hymn of thanksgiving after the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt and the passing through the ted Sea* was accompanied by the sound of timbrels and by dances of a choir of women led by the prophetess Miriam.t -The solemnity of the giving of the law on Sinai was enhanced by the sound of the horn or shofar,’ and the same instrument is mentioned at the capture of Jericho, the first conquest made in the Promised Land.® The sound of trumpets and of the horn announced and inaugurated the great festivals and the year of “Jubilee.”7
But music also permeated the common daily life in Israel, and the absence of the “mirth of tabrets” and the “joy of the harp” was one of the signs of a national calamity.’ It was the pastime of the shepherd ;° it formed the principal attraction of the social gatherings of youth at the city gates; *° it heightened the mirth at the festivals of the harvest

and vintage;'itcontributed to the pleasure and festivity of the banquet ;? the victors in battle were received on their return with ‘singing, dancing, and timbrels.”* In short, music seems to have been the indispensable accompaniment of every public occasion, whether joyous or sad.
But it was in religious worship that music attained its highest development in Israel, and it is to the time of David that the extensive use of music in religious service, both vocal and instrumental, was ascribed. From the 38,000 Levites 4,000 were elected and organized under 288 leaders into a chorus and orchestra to provide for the music of the sanctuary. The 288 classes were separated into 42 divisions under the sons of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, as masters, and the entire chorus and orchestra was under the direction of Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.’ These sanctuary musicians also officiated at the dedication of the temple by Solomon.® Under the later idolatrous kings it may be assumed that the music, like the worship of the temple, was often neglected. It is, on the other hand, especially mentioned that the pious kings, Hezekiah and Josiah, gave much attention to the musical services of the temple.?. It was employed at the restoration of the temple and the walls of Jerusalem after the return from the exile ;® and from post-biblical writings, especially Josephus, it is known that it continued to form a prominent feature of Jewish worship.
The musical instruments mentioned in the Bible may be divided, after the usual classifications, into the following groups:
(1) Instruments of percussion, which were beaten or shaken to produce sound for the purpose of regulating the rhythmic element in music. These instruments were presumably the first used, and are still common among the less cultivated peoples.
(2) Wind instruments.
(3) String instruments, which were always played with the fingers or with the plectrum, and not, like the modern violin, with a bow.
Of the instruments mentioned in the Bible, tvo—the ram’s horn and the trumpet—are commanded to be used for sacred purposes.? These two instruments are also the only ones concerning. whose shape there is absolute certainty.
Of the trumpet there is a representation extant on the Arch of Titus at Rome, while there is no doubt that the ram’s horn which is still used in the synagogue has conserved its antique form."

The instruments exhibited, of which illustrations are given here, were as follows: I.—INSTRUMENTS OF PERCUSSION.
(1) RouND TABRET, HAND-DRUM (Hebrew, Tof).—From Beirut, Syria, where it is called rikk. (See plate 1, fig. 3.) The Arabic name duff agrees with the Hebrew, and is the parent of the Spanish aduffa.
The tabret or timbrel is mentioned in Genesis xxxi, 27. Its use survived from the earliest time to the present day in Asia, Greece, and Italy. On old Grecian monuments the tabret is seen in the hands of Bacchantes and priests of Cybele. On the Egyptian sculptures two forms of the tabret are represented, the round and the four-sided. The use of the striker seems not to have been known in antiquity. The tabret was beaten with the hand and was suspended from the neck by a ribbon. Later modifications of the tabret resemble our drum and the kettle-drum. The use of the tabret was confined to joyous oceasions. It served with other instruments of song: to accentuate the rhythm of the dance.” It was played mostly by women, accompanying the harp and lute, at joyous feasts,’ at the reception of victorious generals,’ at banquets,’ and at weddings.° In solemn processions it was also played by men.* The tabret is not mentioned among the instruments used in the religious serv.ces of the tabernacle or temple.
(2) FOUR-SIDED TABRET, Morocco, Africa. (See plate 1, fig. 4.)
(3) KETTLEDRUM (Arabic, Naggarah), Cairo, Egypt. (See plate 1, fig. 5.)—The kettledrum is made either of wood or copper, one side being rounded, the other flat, on which the skin (of a goat or gazelle) 1s stretched. It is now used in military bands, orchestras, and short solo passages. It is also employed by the dervishes to produce excitement in their devotions. The kettledrum is sounded with blows from a softheaded, elastic mallet, stick, or a leather thong.
(4) CyMBALS (Hebrew, Megiltayim, Velcelim). (See plate 1, fig. 2.) These two Hebrew words, which are usually considered identical, are plainly onomatopoeic. Though it is hardly likely that they indicated the same instrument, we have at present no certain method of differe.tiating them. JMJegiltayim is almost invariably in the dual form, which indicates two similar parts, and in one passage® the material of which they were made, copper or brass, is named. Cymbals are mentioned only in connection with religious ceremonies.’

The cymbals now used in the Orient are much like those depicted on the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. They consisted of two large plates of metal with wide, flat rims, and were played by being strapped to the hands and clashed together. Others were conical, or cup-like, with thin edges, and were played by bringing down the one Sharply on the other, while held stationary, eliciting a high-pitched note. Cymbals were made of brass, and it is probable that they were the first among musical instruments made of metal. They were represented by a specimen from Cairo, Egypt, called by the Arabs Ka’s.
(5) CASTANETS.—(See plate 1, fig. 1.) Some scholars apply the Hebrew names for cymbals, Velgelim and Megiltayim, which denote a jingling sound, also to castanets; others think these are meant by the Cilgele-stema (R. V. “Loud cymbals”) Psalms cl, 5. But this is by no means certain.
(1) Raw’s HORN (Hebrew, Shofar). (See plate 2, fig. 2.)—The Shofar, in the English versions usually inaccurately translated trumpet, or even more inaccurately cornet, is first mentioned in the Bible in. connection with the giving of the law on Sinai.! Its use is ordered in the Pentateuch for the announcement of the new moon and solemn feasts? and the proclamation of the year of release.* New Year’s Day (the first of the seventh montk, or Tishri) is called a “memorial day of blowing.”* The Shofar also served in religious processions,° and is mentioned, along with other musical instruments as a proper accompaniment of psalmody: ‘“ Praise Him with the blowing of the shofar, praise Him with the psaltery and harp.”® But the most ancient and most frequent use of the shofar was for military purposes, to give the signal for the rallying of the people and for attacking and pursuing the enemy. Animal horns were similarly used in the Roman army.? The shofar is not only the sole instrument of those mentioned in the Bible which is still employed by the Jews in their religious services of the synagogue during the penitential month of Hlul (July-August), on New Year’s Day, or Rosh ha-Shanah, the first of Tishri (August-September), and on Atonement Day, or Yom Kippur, the tenth of Tishri, but is also, according to authorities on musical instruments, the oldest form of wind instrument known to be retained in use. It is usually made of a ram’s horn, though the goat’s horn is also employed.°

(2) TRuMPET (Hebrew, Hagogerah), Morocco, where it is called meer. (See plate 3.)—The trumpet was expressly designed in the Pentateuch for sacred uses, two being ordered to be made of silver,’ while Solomon increased their number to one hundred and twenty.’ It was almost exclusively a priestly instrument.’ Its primary use was for giving signals for the people to assemble.! Later it was appropriated to religious services® and festive occasions.’ According to the representation on the Arch of Titus, the trumpet was narrow and straight, with a ball-like protuberance at the bottom. It was represented byits modern survival, the wfeer of Morocco. The instrument itself was supplemented by a photograph of the Arch of Titus. (See plate 5.)
(3) FLUTE OR PIPE (Hebrew, Halil; Revised Version, flute.) Damascus, Syria. (See plate 2, fig. 4.) The pipe or flute, now called in Syria Shubab, was a favorite instrument of the ancients. In its simplest form it was a reed or variety of wood in the shape of a reed, about 18 inches in length, bored throughout evenly, and pierced with hoies in the sides for notes. Later, even ivory was employed. A variety of flutes are exhibited in the representations of Egyptian, Oriental, and Grecian musical instruments. They may be divided into simple flutes, which were either direct or transverse double flutes with even or uneven tubes, and those with several tubes.
The invention of the simple flute is ascribed by the Greeks to the Egyptians; that of the transverse flute likewise to the Kgyptians,® or to the Lybians.’ The double flute is seen on Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. Among the Greeks and Romans the flute was played by the Bacchants, at funerals, and also at festive banquets. The Lacedaemonians, Cretans, and Lybians used it also for military purposes. In the Bible the flute is not mentioned among the musical instruments of the Temple; but it was employed on various festal occasions—at the accession of Solomon to the throne!’ and other festivities,'! as well as at funerals.’ According to post Biblical sources of information, flutes were used in the daily service of the second temple.”

phony) in Daniel iii, 5, 10, 15. The Authorized and Revised Versions give dulcimer, though the margin of the latter gives bagpipe. Engel! says that the Italian peasantry still call a bagpipe Zampogna, and according to the last edition of Gesenius Sambonjo and Zampogna have also persisted in Asia Minor. Swmponiah is supposed by some to be a translation of the Hebrew ‘ugab, though the latter possibly represents pan pipes.
(5) REEDS OR PAN PIPES, Cairo, Egypt. (See plate 2, fig.1.) The reeds now called in Egypt safafir are probably the Hebrew ‘ugab.2 They were known to the Greeks under the name of syrinx (Latin fistula). There was shown in addition to the Egyptian instrument an Assyrian bas-relief representing a flute player. (See plate 3.)
(6) BAGPIPE, represented by an instrument from Tunis, Africa, where it is called zaida, possibly Aramaic Swmponiah mentioned in Daniel iii, 5,10. (See plate 6.) The bagpipe originated in the East, and was known to the Greeks and Romans.’ It was popular throughout the iniddle ages and is still used in many eastern countries and among the country people of Poland, Italy, the south of France, and in Scotland and Ireland.
(1) HArp.—The Hebrew word Kinnor, which is adopted for harp, occurs in the opening chapters of the Bible. It was the especial instrument of David.® Later it was one of the important instruments of the Temple orchestra,® being one of the instruments most frequently mentioned in the Bible.* To judge from representations on Egyptian monuments and Jewish coins of the second century B. C., the Kinnor resembled the Greek Kithara more than the modern trigonal harp, a theory corroborated by the fact that the Hebrew Kinnor is usually rendered Kithara (x:@apa) by the Septuagint, the oldest Greek version of the Old Testament. Jewish coins show lyres with three, five, and Six strings.
A similar instrument was also in use among the Assyrians. In its smaller form it could easily be carried about in processions, as the representations on the monuments, both Egyptian and Assyrian, show. (A photograph of a relief of an Assyrian harp player was exhibited. See plate 7.)
(2) PSALTERY OR DULCIMER (Hebrew, Nebel). (See plate 8.) Next to the harp (kinnor) and mostly in conjunction with it, the psaltery is

most frequently mentioned in the Bible. It is likely that the psaltery resembled what is now known in the East as the tamboora or guitar, an instrument which also figures largely on the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments. In its present shape the psaltery is thus described: ‘In its most complete and perfect form this instrument is 3 feet 9 inches long, has ten strings of fine wire and forty-seven stops. It is played with a plectrum, and is often inlaid with mother-of-pearl and valuable woods. It is oftener, however, of smaller size and less costly materials.”! Others assume that the nebel resembled the harp-shaped instruments seen on Assyrian monuments. In Psalms xxxiil, 2, nebel asor, the “‘ nebel of ten,” probably ten strings, is mentioned. This would curiously agree in detail with the instrument described above. Hngel”® assumes that there is an independent instrument called the asor, which is supported by Psalms xcii, 3, “‘ with an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery.”? PRECIOUS STONES OF THE BIBLE.
The use of precious stones for ornament, as well as with engraving for signets and the like, was well known to all of the Mediterranean peoples, and quite a goodly number of them are mentioned in the Bible.
The engraving of signets upon hard stones was practiced at an early period. The Israelites may have acquired the art from the Egyptians, who are known to have made use of the lapidary’s wheel and emery powder, and are supposed to have been acquainted with the diamond and the method of engraving other stones by means of it. The Assyrians and Babylonians were very skillful in engraving on gems, many of which have been found in the ruins of their palaces and cities.
The sources for the names of gems in the Bible are three almost identical lists:
J. The description of the High Priest’s “breastplate of judgment” (hoshen ha-mishpat), in which were placed, in gold setting, four rows of precious stones, three in each row, engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.*
II. The description of the ornaments of the King of Tyre.°
Ill. The description of the foundation of the Heavenly City.®
In many instances the exact equivalent of the biblical names of precious stones is uncertain in the nomenclature of modern mineralogy. In the following tables are given, alongside of the original and the

of the Revised Version, both in the text and margin, being added in parentheses.
Besides the stones enumerated in these lists, there are probably mentioned, first, diamond, Hebrew shamir, for which the following pasSages serve as illustrations: Jeremiah xvii, 1: “The sin of Judah is . written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond;” Ezekiel ili, 9: “As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead ;” Zechariah vii, 12: “Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law;” second, amber (margin of Revised Version, following the Septuagint and Vulgate, electrum), Hebrew, hashmal, Ezekiel i, 4, which however, may represent some metallic compound, possibly the mixture of gold and silver, now called electrum; and, third, crystal, Hebrew qerah and gabish, properly ice, according to the view of the ancients, that crystal was ice hardened by intense cold.}

The precious stones exhibited were as follows:
RuBy, a variety of corundum (five specimens).—Ruby is given on the margin of the Revised Version for the Hebrew odem, which is also, however, rendered carnelian by some authorities. The Hebrew name indicates reddish stone.
Topaz.—Topaz is the probable rendering of Hebrew pitdah, mentioned in the book of Job (xxviii, 19) as coming from Ethiopia.
GARNET CARBUNCLE (seven specimens).—Carbuncele is given on the margin of the Revised Version for the Hebrew nofek and in the text for the Revised Version for bareqeth.’
EMERALD.—Given in the text of the Revised Version for the Hebrew nofek, and in the margin for Hebrew baregeth and Greek smaragdos.
SAPPHIRE, a variety of corundum (four specimens).—Hebrew sappir and Greek sapfeiros are identical with the English name, which is the same as that in all modern languages. Some, however, assume that these names in the Bible signify lapis lazuli.
SARDONYX, a variety of quartz (two specimens).—Sardonyx is given on the margin of the Revised Version for Hebrew yahalom.’
DIAMOND (one specimen).—The Hebrew yahalom in the High Priest’s breastplate, Exodus xxviii, 18, is rendered ‘“‘ diamond” in the English version and by Luther. But the diamond could not have been used in the breastplate, because the Hebrews knew of no means of engraving aname upon it. In all probability, however, the diamond is understood by Hebrew shamir, Jeremiah xvii, 1; Ezekiel iii, 9; Zechariah vii, 12, where it is spoken of as an object used for engraving, and of extreme hardness.
WHITE SAPPHIRE ADAMANT, a variety of corundum (two specimens).
JACINTH (three specimens).—Jacinth is assumed by some to be the Hebrew leshem.
AGATE, 4 variety of quartz (three specimens).—A gate is agreed to be the Hebrew shebo.
AMETHYST, a variety of quartz (three specimens).—A methyst renders the Hebrew ahlamah. It is so called in Greek because it was thought to be a charm against drunkenness. The Hebrews popularly derived it from halam, to dream, and supposed that it brought pleasant dreams. Other etymologies have, however, been proposed.
BERYL (two specimens).—Beryl is given for the Hebrew tarshish, Revised Version text, and shoham, Revised Version margin.
CHALCEDONY, a variety of quartz (six specimens).—One of the stones enumerated in the description of the foundation of the Heavenly City (Revelation xxi, 19). Some assume that tarshish in the High Priest’s breastplate (Exodus xxviii, 20), means chalcedony. (So the
in the passages in Exodus, Ezekiel, and Revelations mentioned above. 2 Exodus xxviii, 18.

<<<Page: 1304>>>

ONYX, a variety of quartz.—Given in the Revised Version of the Hebrew shoham. Shohams set in gold were put on each of the two shoulderstraps of the ephod of the High Priest, and the two together had engraved the names of the tribes of Israel (Exodus xxviii, 12). It is mentioned in Genesis ii, 12, in the account of the Garden of Eden.
JASPER, a variety of quartz (two specimens).—This is the accepted meaning of the Hebrew name yashpeh, the words being probably identical in origin.
CARNELIAN, a variety of quartz (three specimens).—Possibly Hebrew odem of the High Priest’s breastplate (Exodus xxviii, 17), and the sardius in Revelation iv, 3; xxi, 20.
CHRYSOLITE (two specimens).—Possibly Hebrew tarshish.
AMBER (two specimens).—Probably the Hebrew hashmal (Ezekiel i, 4). Some suppose that amber is understood by Hebrew leshem.
CHRYSOPRASE, a variety of quartz (four specimens).—Enumerated in the description of the foundation of the Heavenly City (Revelation xxi, 20).
LAPIS LAZULI (Persia)—Some authorities suppose that by sappir not sapphire but lapis lazuli is meant.
PEARL.—It is supposed by some that the pearl is meant by the Hebrew peninim, which is often employed in the Old Testament as a figure of something valuable and precious.!
In addition to the gems there was also exhibited a silver breastplate, used as an ornament for the manuscript copy of the Pentateuch (Torah) employed in the synagogue, which represented the twelve stones which were set in the breastplate of the High Priest? with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel underneath them.
A SELECTION OF THE COINS OF BIBLE LANDS. (Plate 9.)
Coined money did not circulate among the Israelites previous to their return from the Babylonian captivity, and indeed there is no evidence that it did then. It is unquestioned, however, that specific weights of gold and silver were well recognized in commercial transactions from a very early period.’ This was principally silver in the form of bars—ingots—translated in the authorized and revised versions
‘Proverbs iii, 15; xxxi, 10; Job xxviii, 18. Jesus uses the pearl for the same purpose (Matthew vii, 6; xiii, 45): ‘‘Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you.” Again, ‘‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls; and having found one of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.”
2Exodus xxviii.

“wedge” (in the original “tongue,” Joshua vii, 21),' disks (kikkar), or rings (often represented on Egyptian monuments), which undoubtedly had a fixed valuation and weight. Generally the metal was weighed on scales to determine its value. Thus the name of the piece of money most frequently occurring in the Bible, shekel, properly denotes “weight” (from shaqal, ‘to weigh”), and to this day it is usual in the East to examine and test carefully by weight all coins received.
After the exile we find mentioned adarkon and darkemon,’ apparently as weights for money, which are usually identified in name with the Persian gold daric. Upon the overthrow of the Persian monarchy Greek coins of the denominations of talents and drachms probably began to circulate in Palestine.
While somé attribute the first coinage of the shekel to Ezra, the earliest native Jewish coins known are shekels and half shekels of silver, and one-sixth skekel of bronze, struck by Simon Maccabeus* about 146 B.C. The succeeding Maccabiean or Hasmonean princes down to 37 B.C. struck small bronze coins with Hebrew or Hebrew and Greek inscriptions. The Idumzan or Herodian princes coined bronze money bearing their names in Greek characters. At the same time the Roman procurators of Juda (from 6 Bb. C.) also struck coins with Greek inscriptions. The last coins struck by the Jews were those during the revolt under Bar-Cochba (132 A. D.). Greek and Roman money was current in Palestine in addition to the native Hebrew coins, aS seen from the New Testament.!

The following specimens were shown as representing the ancient coinage of places mentioned in the Bible:
SHEKEL.—Made of silver and attributed to Simon Maccabaeus (141-136 B. C.), to whom Antiochus VII Sidetes “ gave leave to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp.”! Obverse, a cup representing the pot of manna,’ with the legend: ‘* Shekel of Israel. Year two;” reverse, the budding rod of Aaron,’ with the legend: ‘ Jerusalem the Holy.” (See plate 9, fig. 1.) The value of the shekel in United States currency was ioeh 64 cents. The average shekel weighs between 200 and 220 grains, Troy weight. i
TW0 COINS OF JOHN HYRCANUS (136-106 B.C.).—Original of copper. Obverse, “Jochanan, High Priest and Prince of the Jewish Confederation;” reverse, two cornucopias and a poppy head. (See plate 9, fig. 3.)
WibDow’s MITE.—Coin of Alexander Jannaeus (105-78 B. C.).—Copper (facsimile). Obverse, ‘‘Jonathan the High Priest and the Confederation of the Jews,” within a wreath of olive; reverse, two cornucopias and a poppy head. (See plate 9, fig. 4.) It is assumed that this ora Similar coin is referred to by the term “ widow’s mite” in Mark xii, 42. It is true that in the original it bears the Greek name lepton Neztor, Latin minutum, but a Jewish coin must be assumed here, none other being eerintied within the temple precincts. The mite was the smallest current Jewish coin in the times of Jesus, and was also the smallest temple contribution legally admissible. Its value in the United States currency was about one-eighth of a cent.
Corn OF HEROD ANTIPAS.—Bronze. Obverse (in Greek characters), “Herod Tetrarch,” with a palm branch; reverse, “Tiberias,” within a wreath. (See piate 9, fig. 6.) Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, A. D. 4-39, is often mentioned in the New Testament.* It was he who beheaded John the Baptist, and to him was Jesus sent for examination, by Pilate.’ In honor of the Emperor Tiberias he founded the city of Tiberias, on the western shore of the Sea of Gennesareth, where the coin was struck.

Com oF Herop Purp IT (died A. D. 34).—Struck at Cresarea Philippi in honor of the Eighth Roman Legion. Copper. Obverse, ‘‘ Herod Philip,” with his portrait; reverse, the standards of the Legion. (See plate 9, fig. 7.) Herod Philip is mentioned! as Tetrarch of Iturea; Cesarea Philippi was often visited by Jesus.? It is now a small village called Banijas, near Mount Hermon.
Corn OF AGRIPPA II (last Jewish King).—Bronze. Obverse, name and head of the Emperor; reverse, ‘‘ Money of Agrippa, struck at Neronias” (Ciesarea Philippi). (See plate 9, fig. 2.) Herod Agrippa II was the last Jewish King, 48-100 A. D.’
His long reign was coincident with that of the Roman emperors Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitelius, Vespasian, Titus, Domitan, Nerva, Trajan, and his coins are therefore found bearing the effigies of several emperors. He is mentioned‘ as having an interview with the Apostle Paul in the presence of the Roman Governor Festus at Ciesarea.
DENARIUS, OR ROMAN TRIBUTE PENNY.—Silver (two specimens). Obverse, ‘Tiberius Cesar,” son of deified Agustus (Emperor 14-37 A. D.); reverse, ‘Pontifex Maximus” (Chief Priest). It contained 60 grains Troy of silver, and its value was about 16 cents. (See plate 9, fig. 12.) The denarius was the tribute money that the Jews had to pay to the Romans, and it is very likely that a variety of this coin was shown Jesus with the question “Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cresar or not?”°® The denarius seems to have been the ordinary day’s wages of the Palestinian peasantry.® It is mentioned eleven times in the Gospels* and once in the Revelation (vi, 6). The translation in the English versions, penny, is misleading.
STATER.—Antioch. Silver (facsimile, two specimens). Obverse, “(Money) of Cesar Augustus” (first Roman Emperor, 29 B. C. to 14 A. D.), with head of the Emperor; reverse, Tyche, as genius of the city of Antioch, with her foot on the river god Orontes, and the words, “Thirtieth year of the victory” (i. e., Actium). (See plate 9, fig. 5.) The stater, about equal in value to the shekel, is mentioned (Revised Version, ‘“‘shekel”; margin, ‘‘stater”) as the coin which would be found by Peter in the mouth of the fish, sufficient to pay the Temple tribute, which was half a shekel, for Jesus and himself.®
CoIN OF C2SAREA.—Bronze. Obverse, head of Agustus Ceesar. (See plate 9, fig. 8.) Czesarea, founded by Herod I, is frequently mentioned in the Acts. It was the scene of the conversion of the centurion

Cornelius (x); Philip preached the Gospel here (xxi, 8); Paul was imprisoned here two years before he was sent to Rome (xxiv—xxyvi). It was the residence of the Roman governors, and here the Jewish war against Rome broke out.
TETRADRACHM OF Srpon.—Silver. Obverse, head of the city; reverse, ‘(Money of the Sidonians) Holy and inviolable,” with the figure of Astarte. (See plate 9, fig. 9.) The value of a tetradrachm was about the same as of the shekel, or 64 cents. Sidon, the oldest city of Phenicia, is often mentioned in the Bible. It is at present represented by the town of Saida, with about 15,000 inhabitants.
TETRADRACHMS OF TYRE.—Silver. Obverse; Head of Hercules as Baal (Lord) of the city. (See plate 9, figs. 13, 14.) Tyre, next to Sidon the oldest and most important city of Phenicia, is often referred to in the Bible. During the period of David and Solomon friendly relations were entertained between Tyre and Israel.' The coast of Tyre was visited by Jesus,’ and Paul landed at Tyre on one of his missionary voyages.’ The modern (ur is an unimportant town, with about 5,000 inhabitants.
CoIn oF ASHKELON.—Bronze. Struck by order of Emperor Alexander Severus, about A. D. 228. (See plate 9, figs. 11.)
Ascalon, or Ashkelon, was one of the five cities of the Philistines, 30 miles southwest of Jerusalem;‘ it was the center of the worship of Derceto, the supposed female counterpart of Dagon. It is now represented by the village of Askalan.
COINS OF THE CITY OF DAMASCUS.—Copper (two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 10.) Damascus, the ancient capital of Syria, is mentioned as early as in the times of Abraham.’ Later, it frequently came in contact with Israel. In the New Testament it is especially known from the history of the Apostle Paul.’
TETRADRACHM OF THE CITY OF BABYLON.—Silver. Struck by Mazaios, governor under Alexander the Great, 331-328 B.C. (See plate 9, fig. 16.)
TETRADRACHM OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT (336-323 B. C.).—Silver. Obverse, head of the king; reverse, Zeus (Jupiter) seated holding the eagle. (See plate 9, fig. 15.)
Alexander, King of Macedonia and the famous conqueror, is mentioned by name in I Maccabees vi, 2. It is also assumed that he is typified under the emblem of the ‘“‘he-goat” in Daniel viii, 5, and that his empire is meant by the “fourth monarchy” depicted in Daniel il, 40 and vii, 7, 23f.
TETRADRACHM OF SELEUCUS I NICATOR, KING OF SYRIA, 312-280 B. C.—Silver. Obverse, head of Seleucus; reverse, figure of Jupiter.

(See plate 9, fig. 17.) The city of Seleucia, the principal port of Antioch, from which Paul and Barnabas set out for Cyprus,' was named after Seleucus I.
CoIN OF DEMETRIUS SOTER.—Obverse, head of Demetrius; reverse, “King Demetrius Soter,” with seated female figure. (See plate 9, fig. 19.) Demetrius Soter, King of Syria 162-150 B. C., waged war against the Maccabees and is often mentioned in the books of the Maccabees.’
STATER OF TARSUS.—Silver. 380-360 B. C. Obverse, Baal enthroned within a circle of turrets; reverse, Satrap Tarcamos seated, holding one arrow. (See plate 9, fig. 18.) Tarsus, the ancient capital of Cilicia, Asia Minor, was the home of the Apostle Paul.’ It is stilla city of about 10,000 inhabitants. It is now accessible from Alexandretta by rail.
Coin oF Cyprus.—Bronze. Struck under Emperor Claudius (A. D. 41-54) and the Proconsul Sergius Paulus. (See plate 9, fig. 20.) Cyprus, one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, was the birthplace of Barnabas,‘ and often visited by Paul while Sergius was its proconsul.? In the Old Testament it is referred to by the name of Kittim, which name is, however, also used in some passages in a wider sense for the Greek coasts and islands of the Mediterranean.
TETRADRACHMS OF EPHESUS.—NSilver. Struck 140 B.C. (two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 25.) Ephesus, in ancient time one of the most important cities in Asia Minor, was especially celebrated for its Temple of Diana.® It was the place of residence of Paul,’ of Timothy,’ and of the Apostle John, who probably died there. Ephesus was one of the seven churches referred to in the Apocalypse.’ It was also the seat of the third General Council (A. D. 431) and of the “‘ Robber Synod” (A. D. 449). Numerous ruins are still to be seen there.
HEMIDRACHMS OF EPHESUS.—NSilver. Struck 200 B.C. Obverse, Bee; reverse, Deer (two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 26.)
AES (= AS) OF THESSALONICA).—Copper. Struck 88 B.C. Obverse, head of Janus; reverse, Dioscuri. (See plate 9, fig. 21.) The as or assarius, in the Greek New Testament aocapzov (assarion), in the English version “farthing,” was the original Roman coin, and was at one time the unit in Roman numeration both of weight and currency. The Greeks adopted the name of the coin and used it upon their autonomous coins. The as of the New Testament was of the value of one-sixteenth of a denarius and nearly the size of an English halfpenny. It is mentioned in Matthew x, 29 and 30: “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and one of them shall not fall on the ground

without your Father; but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.”! In Matthew v, 26, the last “farthing” is referred to, and in Mark xii, 42, we read “two mites, which make a farthing.” The Greek word is xodpavtns (Kodrantes, Latin quadrans), which was one-fourth of an as. Thessalonica, formerly the capital of Macedonia, where the coin was struck, is the modern Salonica. Two Epistles of Paul are addressed to the Christians of this place.
CoINn OF THESSALONICA.—Copper. Struck 158 B.C. . Obverse, head of City of Nymph; reverse, Galley. (See plate 9, fig. 22.)
TETRADRACHM OF MACEDONIA.—ASilver. Struck between 156 and 146 B.C. Obverse, head of Minerva upon a Macedonian shield; reverse, Club of Hercules. (See plate 9, fig. 27.) Macedonia is often mentioned in the New Testament. Paul visited this province on his second and third missionary voyages and founded congregations in several of its cities.”
DIDRACHMS OF ATHENS.—NSilver (two specimens) (470 to 230 B. C.). Obverse, head of Athene (Minerva); reverse, Owl. (See plate 9, fig. 24.) Athens, the former capital of Attica and the modern capital of Greece, was visited by Paul, where he delivered the discourse on the Areopagus.*
TETRADRACHMS OF ATHENS.—Silver (470 to 230 B. C.). Obverse, head of Athene (Minerva); reverse, Owl (the bird sacred to Athene) (two specimens). (See plate 9, fig. 23.)
CHILD’S BANK.—Pottery. Excavated at Ostia (seaport of ancient Rome), 1886, by Dr. Thomas Wilson. (See plate 9, fig. 28.)
When found the bank consisted of a single piece of pottery. In the top was a slit through which the money was dropped. It contained 145 silver coins of the Roman Consular or Familia series. As these coins were issued from 200 to 19 B. C., and none of a later date were in the find, it is to be presumed that the bank was buried a short time before the Christian era. The silver denarii in the bank are part of the original lot found with the bank.
The fashion of dress and ornament, as well as the form of household utensils, are, it may be assumed, in the “unchanging East” essentially the same at the present day as in Bible times, and the collection shown of objects of modern life and industry in the Orient explain or illustrate many allusions in the Scriptures.
The objects were as follows:

Prophet Elijah! was probably the skin of a sheep or some animal with the hair left on, wherefore he is called the “ hairy man.’” It was characteristic of the prophet’s office.’ ‘‘ Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.” “And it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive.” ‘The prophet’s (Elijah’s) dress proclaimed the mountaineer of the Arabian border exactly the same as is worn to-day; the undergarment bound with a broad leather belt, and over it a loose, coarse cloak of sheepskin, with the wool outside, its dark-brown folds floating in the wind as he hurriedly strode along with beard bare and long black locks covering his neck, for he was a Nazarite. The Moslem prophet-dervish, as different from the mollah or dervish of the towns as Elijah from a Levite of Jerusalem, exactly copies this dress and habit.” +
MALE COSTUME OF BAGDAD, MESOPOTAMIA.—The general characteristics of Oriental dress have been much the same in aliages. The representations on monuments correspond in general to the raiment in present use. They are the same loose, flowing robes, which can easily be adapted to various purposes. The garments mentioned in the Bible as generally used are the Ketoneth (Greek, yita@v, chiton; English versions, “‘coat”), a kind of shirt worn next to the skin, corresponding to the modern gamis. It reached to the knees or ankles and was either sleeveless or provided only with short sleeves. A person wearing the Ketoneth alone is described as naked.’ Over the shirt there was worn during the day the meil (English versions, cloak”), which had loose sleeves and was longer than the shirt, answering to the modern Kaftan. It_was thrown off when the wearer engaged in manual labor. It was fastened by a girdle and the folds thus formed were used as pockets. It was and is sometimes woven in one piece.o These garments are referred to by Jesus in Matthew v, 40: “And if any man would go to law with thee and take away thy coat (Greek yir@yr, chiton), let him have thy cloak (‘uatiov, himation) also.” Over these was worn an outer garment, referred to by the terms simlah, beged, kesuth, and lebush. It consisted of a rectangular piece of woolen cloth, something like a Scotch plaid, and answered to the modern dwngi in Central Asia or the ab’eih in Egypt, and varied in size and quality with the means of the wearer. There is no special allusion to headdress (except as an ornamental appendage in the description of the dress of the priests). The ordinary headdress of the Bedouin consists of the uffiyeh, a square

folded so that three of the corners hang down over the neck and shoulders, leaving the face exposed, and bound round the head by a cord, and it is probable that in ancient time the head was protected in a similar manner. For the protection of the feet sandals were worn, consisting of leather soles fastened to the foot by means of thongs. Shoes seem to have been worn by women for ornamental purposes.!
WoMAN’S COSTUME OF BAGDAD, MESOPOTAMIA.—The costume of women was essentially similar to that of men. There was sufficient difference, however, to mark the sex, and it was strictly forbidden to a woman to wear ‘that which pertaineth unto a man” and to a man “to put on a woman’s garment” simlah.2. The difference, probably, consisted chiefly in the outer garment. Thatof woman is called Mitpahath,* ma‘atafah, both designating a kind of wrapper or shawl. There are mentioned besides ga if, probably a garment of light, gauzy material, radid,® a similar robe, pethigil,’ explained to denote a wrap of some sort or a girdle.
SyRIAN coAT.—Called in Syriac Abba. It consists of red cloth embroidered in white and is worn as an outer garment.
SILVER NECKLACE (Hebrew, Anagq). (See plate 11, fig.1.) Necklaces, like many other ornaments, were worn by both sexes.’ They consisted of a single band or chain, or of a series of ornaments, as pearls or pieces of corals, strung together. The custom of wearing a necklace is figuratively referred to in Proverbs i, 9: ‘For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck.” Animals ridden by kings were decorated with collars of precious metals,’ and it is still the custom in the East to decorate riding beasts in this way.
SILVER ANKLETS (Hebrew, Akasim). (See plate 11, fig.4.) Anklets worn by women as ornaments are mentioned in Isaiah iii, 16,18. From these passages it would seem that the tinkling produced by knocking the anklets against each other was their chief attraction. To increase the sound, pebbles were sometimes inclosed in them. They were also worn by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, and are still general in India and in Africa. They were sometimes connected by the “anklet chains”! (Hebrew, Ce’adah), which compelled those who wore them to take short, mincing steps.

word nezem denotes both an earring and a nosering.' In modern times the rings are often of extraordinary size and frequently reach to the mouth, so that they must be removed in eating. Sometimes the nose and ears are connected by a series of rings interlinked with one another.
KOHL AND ANCIENT AND MODERN IMPLEMENTS USED IN PAINTING THE EYES (Hebrew, Puch; Aramean, Kuhala). (See plate 11, figs. 6, 8.) The practice of applying pigments to the eyelids and eyebrows in order to enhance the brillianey of the eyes was common in bible times,’ and is still in everyday practice in the East. The pigment, which is a preparation of antimony, is applied to the eyelids by means of a small blunt piece of wood or ivory, which is moistened, dipped in the mixture, and then drawn carefully along the edges of the eye. Irom the Arabic name kohl comes the term “alcohol,” the fineness of the powder suggesting the idea of highly rectified spirits.
MILLSTONES (Hebrew, Rehaim) (see plate 12, figs. 1,2), and a modern photograph showing women grinding corn. (See plate 13.) Millstones are often referred to in the Bible, and they are still used in grinding corn in the same form as in ancient times. They consist of two eylindrical stones. The lower one is firmly planted on the ground and provided with a convex upper surface, on which the concave under surface of the other stone revolves. The upper stone, which is called rekeb or “rider,” has a hole through its center, into which the grain is dropped, and through which runs a shaft to hold the stone in place. A handie attached to the ‘‘rider” enables a person sitting near to turn it around and grind the grain, which is fed with the hand that is free.
Layard ® describes the grinding of corn by the modern Arabs as follows: “The wandering Arabs have no other means of grinding their corn than by hand mills, which they carry with them wherever they go. They are always worked by the women, for it is considered unworthy of aman to engage in any domestic occupation. * * * The grain is passed through the hole of the pivot, and the flour is collected in a cloth spread under the mill. It is then mixed with water, kneaded in a wooden bowl, and pressed by the hand into round balls ready for baking. During these processes the women are usually seated on the ground. Hence in Isaiah xlvii,1,2, the daughter of Babylon is told to sit in the dust and on the ground and “to take the millstones to grind meal.” It was forbidden to take the mill or even the upper stone in pledge, as taking ‘“ the life” (that is the means of sustaining life).‘ As each day so much grain was ground as was needed, the “ voice of the mill” became proverbial.°

GOATSKIN WATERBAG (Hebrew, Nod and Hemeth). (See plate 12, fig. 3.) Skin bottles were commonly used.' Jesus employs them in a comparison: “ Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins” (margin, ‘skins used as bottles”).? Such bottles are made from the whole skins of animals, generally the goat. After the animal is killed and its feet and head removed the rest of the body is drawn out entire without opening the belly, and after the skin has been tanned the places where the legs were cut off are sewn up and when filled it is tied about the neck. These skin bottles were also used to contain milk, and in them the milk was churned. To the corners of the skin bottle filled with milk cords are tied and the skin is thus suspended from three sticks, which are inclined so as to meet at a point above. A girl sits beneath and moves the suspended bottle to and fro.? Skin bottles are also in use in Spain, in the City of Mexico, and by the Eskimos.
BIRD TRAP (Hebrew, Pah). (See plate 14, fig. 1.) The most usual method of catching birds was by the trap, which consisted of two parts, a net strained over a frame and a stick or spring (Hebrew mogesh) to support it, but so placed that it should give way to the slightest touch. The bird trap is frequently used in comparisons for the ensnaring of the heedless and the weak.‘ ‘Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is set for him? Shall a snare spring up from the ground and have taken nothing at all?” ‘Our soul 1s escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers.” “He goeth after her straightway * * * asa bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.” ‘A gin shall take him by the heel and a snare shall lay hold on him.” ‘As the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddeuly upon them.”
Stine (Hebrew, Qela’). (See plate 14, fig. 2.) The sling as a weapon of war is first mentioned in the Book of Judges (xx, 16). David killed Goliath with a stone thrown from a siing.’ The Israelitish army was provided with companies of slingers.6 The sling was also employed in the wars of the Roman against the Jews.’ According to the monuments the sling was both an Egyptian and an Assyrian weapon. It consisted of a strip of leather or woven material, wide in the middle to receive the missile, and narrowing at both ends into a rope. Not only were smooth stones used for hurling, but balls made of burnt clay, of lead, and various other hard substances. It is still used by shepherds to drive away wild animals from their herds as in the time of David.

WOODEN DOOR LOCK AND KEY. (See plate 14, fig. 3.) The doors of Eastern houses, which are usually small and low, seem early to have been provided with hinges turning in sockets, and with locks and keys,! in whose construction no little ingenuity was displayed. Formerly, as now, it is likely that locks and keys were made both of iron and of wood, according to circumstances. The wooden key now quite generally in use consists of a piece of wood about a foot in length provided at one end with a series of pegs. It is thrust into a little opening at the side of the door and applied to the bolt. This has a corresponding series of holes into which the pegs of the key fit, displacing thereby another set of pegs by which the bolt is held in its place.
SYRIAN INKHORN (Hebrew, Qeseth ha sofer). (See plate 11, fig. 9.) The most common writing material among the Hebrews was probably papyrus or dressed skins. This at least must have been the case in the time of Jeremiah, as the expression ‘roll of a book”® points to some pliant material. Ink (Hebrew, deyo), which was made of soot, is mentioned in Jeremiah xxxvi,18, The pen used for writing on papyrus or parchment was no doubt the reed pen still common in the Orient and until recently in southern Europe.t| The inkhorn is mentioned in Ezekiel ix, 2, as being carried “by the side;” that is, fastened to the girdle of the scribe. It is still carried in this fashion in the Orient. The inkhorn consists of a tube containing reed peus and a receptacle for ink.
The next collection was one of objects of Jewish religious ceremonial, which had their origin in and are based upon Biblical ordinances. The following specimens were shown:
MANUSCRIPT COPY OF THE PENTATEUCH, OR FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES IN HEBREW, Sefer Torah.—The Pentateuch or law (Hebrew, Torah) is considered by the Jews the most important part of the Bible. A section of it is read every Sabbath in the synagogue in the morning service, and shorter portions in the afternoon service, on holidays, fasts, and on Monday and Thursday mornings of every week. This latter usage goes back to the days of the early synagogue when Monday and Thursday were court and market days, and the peasants coming to town to dispose of their produce would attend worship. <A manuscript copy is employed, printed copies not being used. When not in use the roll is covered with a cloak and placed upright in an ark or chest.

the reader from losing the place. It is usually made in the shape of a hand, hence its Hebrew name.
SILVER BREASTPLATE OF THE TORAH.—On the top are the two tablets engraved with the Ten Commandments, surmounted by the “erown of the law” upheld by two lions, the symbol of the tribe of Judah. Inside the tablets are engraved, on a sliding plate, the names of the various festivals. (See plate 15.) The manuscript copy of the Pentateuch, or the Sefer Torah, being the most precious object used in Jewish ceremonies, is, when not in use, covered with a mantle of costly material, sometimes.adorned with a breastplate, bells, or crown, and put upright in the “holy ark” (aron ha-kodesh).
VEIL OF THE Hoty ARK (Parocheth)—Made in Constantinople, Turkey. (See plate 16.) The border of green velvet is embroidered in gold and silver with flowers. The center, of red velvet, has in the four corners, in Hebrew, the names of the four archangels, Raphael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Michael. On the top are the words, ‘ But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him,”! and “I have set the Lord always before me.”? Below is a burning lamp hanging down by chains, symbolizing the light which emanates from the law of God. On the sides are the words, ‘This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter into it.”* In the Holy Ark (aron ha-kodesh) are kept the scrolls of the law, or the Pentateuch, written on parchment, for use in the service of the synagogue. The “ Holy Ark” is, therefore, the most important part of the synagogue, and is richly adorned. Whenever it is opened the congregation rises in reverence for the Law of God it contains.
SABBATH LAMP.—Used by the German Jews in their houses. It was manufactured in the eighteenth century in Fellheim, Germany. (See plate 17, fig. 1.) The celebration of the Sabbath is ushered in on its eve (Friday evening) by the housewife lighting candles, reciting the words, “‘ Blessed art Thou, Lord, our God, King of the World, who hath commanded us to light the light of the Sabbath.” After that no fire may be handled until the following evening.
KIDDUSH CLOTH.—Silk. Containing in beadwork the tablets of the decalogue in Hebrew, supported by lions. Above are the words, ‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”* Before the principal meals of the Sabbath and other feast days the Jews have a special service, including prayers over the wine and bread, which is known as Kiddush, or “sanctification.” The head of the family has in front of him a plate containing two loaves of bread, covered by a cloth. The practice of saying a blessing before eating is referred to in I Samuel ix, 13. It no doubt had its origin in the fact that a public meal of any sort was usually preceded by a sacrifice. ‘‘ Asking the blessing” was

common in New Testament times. The later Jews enjoined also that thanks should be returned after the repast.
SILVER SPICE BOX.—Supposed to have been manufactured in Laupheim (Wiirtemberg), Germany, about 1740. (See plate 15, fig. 4.) This box, filled with spices, is used in the Jewish service known as Habdalah (or separation), the service of the conclusion of the Sabbath, There isa tradition that at the beginning of the Sabbath a special angel accompanies the worshiper from the synagogue; this angel remains with him until the conelusion of the Sabbath. The departure of the angel leaves the man faint, and the spices are intended to resture him. The objects used in this service are a cup of wine, the spice box, and a candle. First a blessing is said over the wine, next over the spices, and last over the light. The cup of wine and the spice box are passed around among the members of the household. The candle is then extinguished by having wine poured upon it.
BRASS PLATE, USED AT THE PASSOVER MEAL.— Adorned with animal figures and flowers and containing an Arabic inscription in Hebrew characters. Made in Constantinopie (see plate 19). At the Passover meal (Seder, properly ‘‘order”) a large plate is put on the table, which forms, as it were, the altar of the service. On it are placed the various emblematic articles of the ceremony. These are: a piece of roasted meat, usually the bone of a lamb, representing the Passover lamb; a roasted egg, in memory of the festal sacrifice offered in the Temple; bitter herbs (maror, usually horse-radish), in commemoration of the “embittering of life” which Israel suffered in Egyptian servitude;! charoseth, ~ compound of almonds, apples, and sirup, which has the color of brick-clay, and into which the bitter herbs are dipped before it is partaken of; some green herbs (lettuce or something similar), as the ‘‘food of poverty;” and the unleavened bread or mag¢goth, the principal food of the Passover feast, which is the ‘“‘bread of affliction, for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste.””
OMER TABLET (manuscript). (See plate 20.) Used in the Synagogue for reckoning the period between Passover and Pentecost. The tablet is in Hebrew. It contains the words, “ Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His Commandments and commanded us to count the Omer.” Then follows the count (in Hebrew), and below it the words, ‘May the Lord restore the worship of the temple speedily in our days,” and Psalm Ixvii. The letters H,S, and D on the left, mean, respectively, Omer (written Homer by the Spanish Jews), week (Sabbath), and day. The figures on the right indicate that it is the forty-seventh day of Omer, i. e., six weeks and five days. The harvest season was formally opened with the ceremony of waving a sheaf of barley in the sanctuary on the second day of the Passover feast, which began on the 15th of Nisan (March-April).
1 Exodus i, 14. 2?Deuteronomy xvi, 3.

<<<Page: 1342>>>

Before this ceremony took place the harvesting of grain was forbidden :! ‘And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God.” From that day seven weeks, or forty-nine days, were counted,’ to the feast of Pentecost; hence its Hebrew name Hag ha-Shabuoth “feast of weeks,” and the usual English name “Pentecost,” which is the mevtnnootn pentekoste, meaning the fiftieth day. It is also called ‘feast of harvest,”* because the grain harvest then approached its close, and ‘‘day of first fruits,”* because two loaves of bread from the new wheat were offered on that feast.” With the destruction of the Temple the ceremony of waving the sheaf in the Sanctuary necessarily fell away, but the counting is still observed and the prayers contained in the tablet form part of the ritual during the time from Passover to Pentecost.
LULAB AND ETHROG.—The Lulab and Ethrog, bound up with myrtle and willow branches, are used by the Jews at the feast of Tabernacles, in pursuance of the command in Leviticus xxiii, 40: ‘And ye shall take you on the first day, the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.” Each day of the feast a circuit (haqqafah) is made during the service with the Lulab in the right hand and Ethrog in the left, while reciting the prayers; beginning and closing with the invocation “Hosanna.” On the seventh day seven such processions take place and willow branches are beaten on the benches, and this day is therefore called Hosannah Rabbah, the day of the great Hosanna.
MANUSCRIPT COPY OF THE BOOK OF ESTHER, written on parchment, with hand-painted views illustrating the events narrated in the book.— The Book of Esther is usually called Megilla (roll), or more fully Megitllath Esther (roll of Esther). It is read in the Synagogue on the feast of Purim, on the 15th of Adar (March-April), established to commemorate the deliverance of the Jews from the machinations of Haman related in this book. It is one of the “five rolls” (hamesh megilloth) which are read on various occasions in the Synagogue, the others being the Songs of Solomon or Canticles, Ruth, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations.
LAMP USED AT THE FEAST OF DEDICATION (Hanukkah). (See plate 17, fig. 2.) The Feast of Dedication is celebrated in commemoration of the purging of the temple and restoration of the altar after Judas Maccabeus had driven out the Syrians in 164 B. C. Its institution is

recorded in I Maccabees iv, 47-59. According to Josephus,' it was called “lights” (pra, phota). In the New Testiment’ it is mentioned under the name of ¢yxazvia (enkainia). In the Talmud we have the legend that when the Jews entered the temple after driving out the Syrians, they found only one bottle of oil which had not been polluted, and that this was miraculously increased so as to feed the lamps of the sanctuary for eight days. The festival is held eight days, beginning with the 25th of Kislev (December—January). The principal feature of its celebration is the lighting of lights, beginning with one light on the first night and increasing the number by one light on each of the succeeding nights. The specimen is probably of Dutch make and exhibits an interesting survival of the ancient Roman lamps.
KNIFE AND CUP USED AT CIRCUMCISION. (See plate 18, fig. 1.) The rite of circumcision (milah) is practiced in pursuance of Genesis xvii, 10-12: “This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee; every male among you shall be cireumcised. And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations.” In early times circumcision was performed with stone knives.’ The later Jews used iron or steel knives. With the performance of the rite of circumcision was combined the naming of the child.’ Cireumeision was common in Egypt as early as the fourth dynasty.” At the present day it prevails among the Kaffirs and some negro tribes of Africa, in parts of Australia, in many of the South Sea Islands, and it is said to be practiced by the Abyssinian Christians asa national custom. Early Spanish travelers found it to be prevalent in the West Indies, Mexico, and among tribes in South America. It is a common rite among Mohammedaus everywhere.
GARMENT OF FRINGES (Arba Kanfoth)—This garment is worn by men in pursuance of the command® ‘*Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four borders of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.” It is usually made of wool, with fringes attached to the four corners, and is worn over the shoulders, underneath the ordinary outer garment.
PHYLACTERIES (tefillin). (See plate 21.)—Used by Jewish males after they attain the age of 13 years and a day, at morning prayers, except on Saturday and other feast days. These objects are employed in the Jewish ritual in pursuance of the command that the words of God should be ‘“‘a sign upon your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes.”’ They consist of parchment cases containing the passages

Deuteronomy vi, 4-9, and xi, 13-21, written on slips of parchment, attached to leather straps for binding on the forehead and left arm. In the case for the head the passages are written on four separate strips, and in the ease for the hand on one piece of parchment, and put into a squarecase. They arecalled tefillin in the Talmud, a word derived from tefillah (prayer). The New Testament refers to their ostentatious use.!
SILK PRAYER SHAWL ( Tallith).—The tallith is a kind of prayer shawl made of silk, wool, or linen, with ¢igith or fringes fastened to the four corners, worn by men at the morning services. It is usually adorned with horizontal stripes of blue or purple; the Jews in the Orient substitute for these stripes a blue ribband worked in the corners. The wearing of a garment with fringes is commanded.’ In ancient times this garment, it seems, waS worn as an outer robe.’ At present the Jews wear, besides the tallith, a kind of vest with fringes under the upper garments, which is called the ‘small tallith” (tallith katon), or the “four corners” (arba’ kanfoth).
GOLD WEDDING RING. (See plate 11, fig. 2.) The Jewish marriage is made valid by the Kiddushin, i. e., by the bridegroom putting a ring on the hand of the bride while saying the words: “ Behold, thou art wedded to me by this ring according to the law of Moses and Israel.”
MARRIAGE CONTRACT (kethubah), written on parchment and illuminated. (See plate 22.) In the kethubah, or marriage contract, are recorded the obligations of the husband and the amount of the dowry allowed the bride. There is an established form of the kethubah usually beginning with the words: ‘Under good auspices, and with good luck to bridegroom and bride, ‘Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favor of the Lord.’”! The husband pledges himself to love and honor his wife and to provide for her becomingly. The minimum of the dowry is fixed by the law to be 200 shekles (about $50) for a virgin and 100 (about $25) for a widow or divorced woman. To this is usually added what the bride has received from her parents and what the husband settles on her voluntarily, all of which she gets in case of the death of the husband, or of divorce. The contract is dated Rome, in the year of creation 5576 (1816). The contracting parties are Elijah Saki and Masal-Tob (Fortune), of Castlenuovo. The witnesses to the contract are Josua Gerson Ashkenazi and Michael Chayim Megula.
The margin is decorated with various symbolical figures, and contains the liturgy of the wedding ceremony and passages from the Bible and the Talmud referring to marriage and married life, artistically intertwined in garlands. Above, in the center, are probably the arms of the bridegroom ; to the right a boy standing on a wheel pouring out the horn of plenty, with the motto, ‘““All depends on merit and good luck ;” to the left a female figure with tambourines, and the words, ‘‘ Peace

and welcome to those nigh and far.” Below, to the right, is a female figure holding two burning hearts linked together by a chain, with the adage, “‘A well-mated couple is chosen by God” (marriages are made in heaven); to the left another female figure holding a tambourine and a flower, with a quotation from Isaiah xxxii, 8. The representation at the bottom, of Elijah ascending to heaven in a fiery chariot, his mantle talling on his disciple and successor Elisha,! was probably suggested by the name of the bridegroom.
MIZRACH (the east)—Mizrach means east, literally the place of the rising sun. There is hung in Jewish houses a tablet on the eastern wall to indicate the direction of the face when at prayer. It contains the Ten Commandments and various quotations from Scripture in Hebrew. The idea which dictates this direction is that the face shall be turned toward Jerusalem. West of Jerusalem the opposite direction would be chosen. In the temple itself the direction of prayer was toward the west, the entrance being from the east. Ancient nations that worshiped the sun turned when in prayer toward the east, the place of the rising sun. This fact is alluded to in Ezekiel viii, 16: “At the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east.”
KNIFE WITH ITS SHEATH, used for the slaughtering of animals. (See plate 17, fig. 3.) The killing of animals for food is performed by a person especially trained and authorized, called shochet. The throat is cut with a long knife (halaf) and the internal organs are examined for traces of disease. The act of killing is called shechita; that of searching, bedika. During both acts short prayers are recited. If there be a notch (pegima)in the knife, or if any trace of disease be found, the animal is unfit (terefa) to be eaten.
Next to the Israelites, with whom the Scriptures originated, the antiquities of those nations with whom Israel came in close contact, and who to a great extent influenced the course and development of the history narrated in the Bible, claim the interest of the Bible student. The exhibits in this department consisted of objects representing Kgypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and the Hittites.
CAST OF A BUST OF RAmMSES II.—Ramses II? was the third king of the nineteenth dynasty and the most brilliant monarch of Egypt. He was formerly identified as the Pharaoh of the Exodus; later authorities hold that that event took place five years after his death. He was, however, in all probability, the Pharaoh of the oppression. The

reasons for this supposition are that the land of Goshen in which the Israelites settled when they migrated to Egypt' is also called the land of Ramses, and that one of the cities which the Israelites built while in bondage was named Ramses.” As Kamses I reigned only for a short time, it is assumed that these names are connected with Ramses II, whose reign extended over sixty-six years in the thirteenth century B. C. (1348-1281 B. C.); and who was not only the most warlike but also the greatest builder among the Egyptian kings. The cities Pithom and Ramses which the Hebrews built for Pharaoh are thought to have been situated in the modern Wadi Tumilat. Pithom
vas identified in 1883 with Tell el-Maskutah in the east of this Wadi at the railroad station Ramses. Besides the building of these two cities and numerous temples, Ramses II seems also to have undertaken the coutinuation of the canal of the Wadi Tumilat to the Bitter Lakes, and the cutting through of the rising ground between them and the Red Sea, which connection between the Nile and the Red Sea was the true precursor of the Suez Canal.? The bust, which is taken from a sitting statue, represents him beardless with a helmet on his head. The original, of black granite, isin the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Turin, Italy.
CAST OF A RELIEF OF RAMSES IJ.—Photographs of the mummy of Ramses II. The mummy was discovered in July, 1881. The photographs were taken immediately after the unwinding of the mummy in June, 1886.4

4Century Magazine, May, 1887. This mummy is in many ways the finest ever discovered and is of surpassing interest. Professor Maspero describes it as follows: ‘The head is long, and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temples there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth straight locks about 5 centimeters in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow ridge prominent; the eyebrows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons, and slightly crushed at the tip by the pressure of bandages. The temples are sunken; the cheek bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced like those of a woman for the wearing of earrings. The jawbone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped and full of some kind of black paste. This paste being partly cut away with the scissors disclosed some much worn and brittle teeth, which, moreover, are white and well preserved. The mustache and beard are thin. They seemed to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king’s illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly and from 2 to 3 millimeters in length. The skin is of earthy brown, spotted with black. Finally, it may be said the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is intellectual, perhaps slightly animal, but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mumification, there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve and of pride.”

<<<Page: 1359>>>

The typical physiognomy of the native Egyptian, as exhibited on the numerous monuments, shows a head often too large in proportion to the body, a square and somewhat low forehead, a short and round nose, eyes large and wide open, the cheeks filled out, the lips thick, but not reversed, and the mouth somewhat wide. Contrasting the features of Ramses II with these, some scholars have assumed that he was of Semitic descent or at least had Semitie blood in his veins.
CAST OF THE HEAD OF SETI I.—The original is at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities at Cairo, Egypt. Seti I was the second king of the nineteenth dynasty and father of Ramses II, the Pharaoh of the oppression. He reigned for about twenty-seven years in the thirteenth century B. C.
CAST OF A RELIEF OF SETI I.—Photograph of the mummy of Seti I. Taken under the direction of Prof. G. Maspero at the Museum of Kgyptian Antiquities, Cairo, Egypt.
CAST OF THE HEAD OF TIRHAKAH.—Original of granite in the Museum of Antiquities at Cairo. King of Egypt and Ethiopia, 698-672 B.C. According to the Biblical account,' Tirhakah, ‘King of Ethiopia” (in Egyptian Taharqa), encountered Senacherib, King of Assyria, while the latter was on his expedition against Judah. From the Cuneiform inscriptions we learn that Tirhakah entered into an alliance with Baal, King of Tyre, against Assyria. Hezekiah, King of Judah, also joined the league. Esarhaddon marched into Egypt, and putting Tirhakah to flight he placed the rule of the whole country under twenty vassals loyal to Assyria. On the death of Esarhaddon, Tirhakah returned to Egypt, drove out the Assyrians that were there, and took possession of Memphis. Assurbanipal, the son and successor of Esarhaddon (668-626 B.C.), at once went to Egypt and defeated him at Karbanit. Tirhakah was again obliged to flee to Thebes and thence to Nubia. The twenty vassal kings were restored and Necho (Nikuw), “King of Sais and Memphis” put at their head. Soon after this Necho headed a rebellion against the Assyrian rule, but the plot was suppressed by the Assyrian garrison of Egypt and Necho sent in chains to Nineveh. But when Assurbanipal heard of the new successes of Tirhakah in Egypt, he sent Necho back to rule over all Egypt under the direction of Assyria. Tirhakah soon afterwards died. Manetho, who calls him Tarkos (Tarakos), says he was the last king of the twenty-fifth dynasty. Strabo (xvi, I, 6) calls him Tearkon, and describes him as one of the greatest conquerors of the ancient world.
MummMy.—Length, 5 feet 6 inches. Found at Luxor, Egypt, in 1886. (See plates 23 and 24.) No hieroglyphies or inscriptions exist either on the mummy or outer case. The face and head are covered with a mask of green cement, the body delicately proportioned. On the chest lie four small tablets about the size of playing cards, each one having a mummied figure of Osiris in a standing position. Two shield-shaped
1TI Kings xix, 9, and Isaiah xxxvii, 9.

<<<Page: 1360>>>

ornaments lie across the breast and stomach, respectively. The upper one bears the sacred beetie with spread wings, beneath which is a nilometer standing between two figures, which support each a globe upon the head. The faces of these figures are covered with square pieces of gold leaf. At the end of the wings is represented the hawkhead of Ra, aiso supporting a globe. Over the surface of the shield are painted representations of jewelry. On the lower shield appears a kneeling figure of Nephthys, with extended arms and wings. Upon her head she wears a headband supporting a globe. On either side of the head are two groups, each containing three small figures. Ostrich plumes appear in the corner of the shield. Along the legs is a sheet of cemented linen, on the top of which is a mummy on a dog-shaped bier; at the head of the bier is a figure kneeling, holding an ostrich plume; below this is a group of seven kneeling figures holding plumes. Further down is a second nilometer, on either side of which a figure with an implement in each hand faces two mummied figures, both of which have the faces concealed with a square patch of gold leaf. The feet are incased in a covering of cemented linen.
The Egyptians conceived man as consisting of at least three parts— the body, the soul, and the Ka, i.e., the double or genius. The Ka was supposed to remain in existence after death, and to be the representative of the human personality. In order that the Ka might take possession of the body when it pleased, the body had to be preserved from decay. The preservation of the body was accordingly the chief end of every Egyptian who wished for everlasting life. To this end the Egyptians mummified their bodies, built indestructible tombs, inscribed the tombs and coffins with magical formule to repel the attacks of the demons, and placed statutes, household goods, food, statuettes of servants, etc., that the tomb might resemble as much as possible the old home of the deceased.!. The process of mummifying the bodies by various methods of embalming was of high antiquity in Egypt, probably going back to the earliest dynasties; the oldest mummy which was found at Saqqarah in 1881, and is now at the museum of Gizeh, dates from 5200 B. C. This practice is said to have continued to 500 A. D. The art reacled the highest point at Thebes during the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, when spices and aromatic substances were used, and the skin of the bodies so prepared as to retain a slight color and a certain flexibility. What is known of the process is derived chiefly from the Greek writers Herodotus? and Diodorus Siculus,* and from examinations of the mummies themselves. According to these sources the Egyptians employed three methods of embalming, of more or less elaborateness, according to the wealth and position of the deceased. The most costly mode is estimated by Diodorus at a talent of silver—about $1,250. The embalmers first removed part of the brain through the nostrils by means of an iron hook,

destroying the rest by the infusion of caustic drugs. An incision was then made in the side with a sharp Ethiopian stone and the intestines removed. The abdomen was rinsed with palm wine and sprinkled with powdered perfumes. It was then filled with pure nyrrh. pounded, cassia, and other aromatics, frankincense excepted, and sewn up again. The body was then steeped in natron (subcarbonate of sdda) for seventy days, afterwards washed and swathed in strips of linen and smeared with gum. The second mode of embalming cost about 20 minae—about $300. In this case cedar oil was injected into the abdomen. The oil was prevented from escaping, and the body steeped in natron for the prescribed time. On the last day the cedar oil was let out from the abdomen, carrying with it the intestines in a state of dissolution, while the flesh was consumed by the natron, so that nothing
yas left but the skin and bones. The third method, which was used for the poorer classes, consisted in rinsing the abdomen with syrimaea, an infusion of senna and cassia, and steeping the body for the usual period in natron. Examinations of Egyptian mummies have proven the accounts of Herodotus and Diodorus to be in the main correct. For mummies, both with and without ventral incisions, are found, and some are preserved by means of balsams and gums, and others by bitumen and natrum, and the hundreds of skulls of mummies which are found at Thebes contain absolutely nothing, while other skulls are found to be filled with bitumen, linen rags, and resin. The term ‘mummy” is derived from the Arabic mumiya, “bitumen” and the Arabic word for mummy is mumiyya “ bitumenized thing.” The native Kgyptian word for mummy is sahu.' In the Bible, instances of embalming are only met with in connection with the Egyptians, the bodies of Jacob and Joseph, who died in Egypt, being thus treated.’
MODEL OF A MUMMY. (See plate 25.) Small wooden figure in mummy case.

FRAGMENTS OF MUMMIED DOG, CAT, CROCODILE, AND OTHER ANIMALS. (See plate 25.) The Egyptians believed that their several divinities assumed the forms of various animals; so, for instance, Ptah appears as the Apis-bull, Amon as aram, Sebek is represented as a crocodile-headed man, Bastis as a cat-headed woman, etc. These animals are therefore venerated as the manifestations or symbols of the respective divinities, and the willful killing of one of them was a capital offense. These sacred animals were embalmed and buried in graves. Thus, at Bubastis, the center of the worship of the goddess Bast, y

a special cemetery for cats, which was recently identified at the modern Zagazig. Diodorus Siculus says! that when a cat died all the inmates of the house shaved their eyebrows as a sign of mourning.”
Book OF THE DEAD.—A series of original fragments and a facsimile of gn Egyptian papyrus at the British Museum in London. The so-called Egyptian “Books of the Dead” are collections of religious texts, hymns, invocations, prayers to the gods, etc., intended for the use and protection of the dead in the world beyond the grave. The original of the one referred to was found in the tomb of Ani, ‘‘Royal Seribe” and Scribe of the Sacred Revenue of all the gods of Thebes, “ who is accompanied on his way through the divers parts of the reali of the dead by his wife, Tutu. The hieroglyphic text is accompanied by colored vignettes, which depict the various scenes through which the deceased has to pass in the nether world, as his appearance before Osiris, the Supreme Judge of the dead, the weighing of the heart of the departed against the goddess of Truth, ete. The prayers and magical formule were written out on a roll of papyrus and bound up inside the bandages of the mummy.
Two SCARABAEI.—The Scarabeus Aegyptiorum, or Ateuchus Sacer, that is, the great cockchafer found in tropical countries, was regarded in Egypt as the symbol of the god Kheper, who was termed by the Egyptians ‘‘the father of the gods,” and who was later identified with the rising sun. As the sun by his daily revolution and reappearance typified the return of the soul to the body, the scarab:eus, which is in Egyptian likewise called Kheper, was the emblem of the revivication of the body and the immortality of the soul. Models of Scarabzei, made of various kinds of materials, usually inscribed with names of gods, kings, and other persons, and with magical legends and devices, were buried with the mummies (placed on the heart or the finger of the dead) and were also worn by the living, principally as charms. The insects themselves have also been found in coffins.
EGYPTIAN BRICK.—Sun-baked brick from an early tomb, Thebes, Egypt. The usual dimensions of an Egyptian brick was from 20 or 17 to 145 inches in length, 82 to 64 inches in width, and 7 to 44 inches thick. It consists of ordinary soil mixed with chopped straw and sunbaked. ‘Chis method of making bricks is alluded to in Exodus y, 18, where the oppressed Israelites are told ‘ there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.” In the ruins of Pithom, one of the cities in which the Israelites were employed, three kinds of brick were discovered, some with stubble, some with straw, and some without. Among the paintings of Thebes, one on a tomb represents brickmaking captives with ‘“taskmasters,” who, armed with sticks, are receiving the “tale of bricks” and urging on the work. Judging from the monuments, the process of making sun-dried bricks was much the Same aS in modern times. The clay or mud was mixed with the neces-

sary amount of straw or stubble by treading it down in a shallow pit. The prepared clay was carried in hods upon the shoulders and shaped into bricks of various sizes.!
MopERN EGYPTIAN BRICK FROM THEBES.—Of the same general make and character as the ancient specimen.
EGYPTIAN CoTTon.—Cotton of a very fine grade is now grown in Egypt. The question as to whether it was known or extensively used in that country, or in other lands bordering on the Mediterranean, is one that has given rise to much discussion. Authorities on the cotton plant have detinitely asserted that it was well known in Egypt from early times; thus M. Jardin’ states that it is certain that the cotton plant existed in Upper Egypt, Nubia, and Abyssinia in the wild state; that it was known to the ancient Egyptians, and that the proof of its existence is the finding of some seeds of Gossypium Arboreum, by Rosellini, in the coffin of amummy. He further holds the opinion that linen and cotton were simultaneously employed in Egypt, buf that the former was more costly than the latter and was reserved for purposes relating to the cult. In the valuable work on the Cotton Plant issued by the United States Department of Agriculture,’ Mr. Rk. B. Handy, the author of a chapter on the Ancient History of Cotton, holds practically the same view. On the other hand, it has been claimed by some authors that cotton was quite unknown in Egypt, a fact largely based upon the conclusions arrived at by James Thomson in an article on the ** Mummy Cloths of Egypt.”° Mr. Thomson, after twelve years’ study of the subject, reached the opinion that the bandages of the mummy were universally made of linen. It would appear that cotton was not well known to the ancient Israelites, for we find it mentioned but once in the Bible, in the Book of Esther,’ which, of course, has a Persian background and contains a description of a Persian palace. The passage reads: ‘“ In the court of the garden of the King’s Palace there were hangings of white and violet-colored cotton cloths fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble.” The Hebrew word translated ‘‘cotton” is “‘ karpas,” derived from the Sanskrit ‘‘ karpasa.”
Between the extremes of opinion, the truth seems to be that cotton was indigenous in India and that its products made their way gradually. through commerce, to the Mediterranean countries and that the plant itself followed gradually either through commerce or by way of Persia. It is plain that the cotton plant existed in Egypt in the time of Pliny

(the first century of the Christian era), and it also seems likely that inasmuch as there is no representation whatsoever on any Egyptian monuments thus far found, or on any monuments found in Western Asia, of a cotton plant, that it was not known in that country in early days. It is difficult to conclude that so striking an object would not have been depicted on the monuments, when the ancient artists found it possible to figure so many of the various plants known to them.
Illustrating these countries the following specimens were shown:
CAST OF THE SO-CALLED OVAL OF SARGON.—The original is a small egg-shaped piece of veined marble, pierced lengthwise. It was discovered by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam at Abu-Habba, Babylonian Sippar (in the Bible Sepharvaim), a city from which the King of Assyria transported colonists to Samaria. The inscription reads: *‘I, Sargon, the king of the city, King of Agade, have dedicated this to the Sun-god (Samas) of Sippar.” This king is supposed to have reigned about 3,800 B. C., and the object is no doubt a contemporary document. The date is derived from a statement on the cylinder of Nabonidus found at the same place. Nabonidus, the last King of Babylon (555-538 B. C.), the father of Belshazzar, records that when rebuilding the Temple of the Sun-god he found the original foundation stone of Naram-Sin, Sargon’s son, which none of his predecessors had seen for 3200 years. Agade, mentioned on the Oval of Sargon, is Akkad, enumerated in the genealogical tablet! as one of the four cities of Nimrod’s empire. Akkad was also the name of the entire district of North Babylonia.’
MODEL OF A TEMPLE TOWER OF BABYLON.—The model is plaster, painted, and was made after the descriptions of the Temple Tower of Borsippa, on the scale of one-fourth inch to the foot. (See plate 26.) From the most ancient times the principal cities of Mesopotamia had towers. These were used as observatories, also for the performance of religious ceremonies, and perhaps in early times for military defense. In Genesis xi, 1-9, it is related that certain immigrants began to build in the plain of Shinear a city and a tower, which was left incomplete in consequence of the confusion of tongues, and the city was thence called Babel (confusion). This “Tower of Babel” has been connected both by Arab tradition and on the authority of archaeologists with the imposing ruins of Birs-Nimrud (‘ Nimrod’s Tower”) on the site of the Temple Tower of Nebo, at Borsippa. which was a surburb of the city of Babylon, and which in the cuneiform inscriptions is called ‘ Babylon the Second.” This Temple Tower of Borsippa, termed in the inscriptions H-zida (“the eternal house”), was a perfect type of these edifices, and it has been suggested as probable that the Tower of Babel men-

tioned in Genesis was conceived on the same plan. The Temple of Borsippa was reconstructed with great splendor by Nebuchadnezzar (604-561 B. C.), but he made no changes in the general character and plan. According to the description of Herodotus,’ who mistakes it for the Temple of Bel, and the report of Sir Henry Rawlinson, who carefully examined the mound of Birs-Nimrud, the Tower of Borsippa appears to have been constructed on the plan of a step-shaped or terraced pyramid. Such stepped pyramids have not only survived in Egypt, in the Great Pyramid of Sakkarah, but are also found in Mexico (at Cholula, City of Mexico, etc.), where they are called Teocallis—i. e., ‘houses of god”—consisting of terraced structures, five to seven stories high, and surmounted by a chamber or cell, which is the temple itself. It is assumed that these temple towers were the prototype of the later Egyptian pyramids, the stories disappearing in the latter by filling up the platforms of the different stages, which produced an uninterrupted slope on all sides. The Temple Tower of Nebo, at Borsippa, was built in seven stages, whence it is sometimes called in the inscriptions ‘Temple of the seven spheres of heaven and earth.” Upon an artificial terrace of burnt bricks rose the first stage, 272 feet square; on this the second, 230 feet square; then the third, 188 feet square, each of these three lower stages being 26 feet high. The height of each of the four upper stories was 15 feet, while their width was 146, 104, 62, and 20 feet, respectively, so that the whole edifice, not including the artificial terrace, had a height of about 140 feet. The several stages were faced with enameled bricks in the colors attributed to the different planets, the first story, representing Saturn, in black; then, in order, Jupiter, orange; Mars, red; the Sun, thought to have been originally plated with gold; Venus, white; Mércury, blue, and the seventh, dedicated to the Moon, the head of the Babylonian pantheon, was plated with silver. The floors of the platforms were probably inlaid with mosaics. The whole structure terminated in a chapel placed on the central axis of the tower and surmounted by acupola. According to Herodotus there stood in the spacious sanctuary on the top of the tower a couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side. But no statue of any kind was set up in the chamber, nor was it occupied at night by anyone but a native woman. The top stage was also used as an observatory. Double converging stairs or gently ascending ramps led up to the several platforms.
THE CHALDEAN DELUGE TABLET.—Containing the cuneiform text of the Babylonian account of the Deluge as restored by Prof. Paul Haupt. Engraved in clay under the direction of Professor Haupt, by Dr. R. Zehnpfand, of Rossiau, Germany. Measurement, 82 by 62 inches. The Babylonian story of the Deluge is contained in the eleventh tablet of the so-called Izdubar or Gilgamesh? legends, commonly known under the name of the Babylonian Nimrod Epic. The Babylonian

<<<Page: 1374>>>

narrative of the Deluge closely accords both in matter and language with the biblical account as contained in Genesis vi-vili. Xisuthrus or Hasisadra, the hero of the Babylonian account, corresponding to the Biblical Noah, is informed by a god of the coming flood and ordered to build a ship to preserve himself, his family, and friends, and various animals. After he had sent out divers birds (a dove, swallow, and raven) he landed on the mountain Nizir,in Armenia, and offers a sacrifice to the gods, after which he is transferred to live with the gods. The originals were found during the British excavations in the Valley of the Euphrates and Tigris, and are now preserved in the British Museum, in London. There was also exhibited a cast of some of the original fragments now preserved in the British Museum.
CAST OF A COLOSSAL HUMAN-HEADED WINGED LION, 11 by 9 feet; original of yellow limestone in the British Museum. It was found by Sir Austen H. Layard in 1846 at Kuyunjik on the site of ancient Nineveh, and is supposed to belong to the period of Asurnazirpal, who reigned 884-860 B.C. Figures of composite animals of stone or metal, sometimes of colossal size, were placed by the Assyrians at the entrances _ to the temples of the gods and the palaces of the kings. They were considered as emblems of divine power, or genii (Assyrian, shedu), and believed to “exclude all evil.” Lions were also placed ‘beside the stays” and on either side of the steps of the gilded ivory throne of Solomon.! Some Assyriologists connect the Assyrian winged and composite beings with those seen by the prophet Ezekiel in his vision of the “chariot,” as described in the first chapter of his prophecies, and the cherubim guarding the entrance to the Garden of Eden’ and those carved on the Ark of the Covenant.’ Parallels are also found in the religious figures of other peoples, as the sphinx of the Egyptians and Persians, the chimera of the Greeks, and the griffin of northeastern mythology. It would seem that the composite creature form was intended to symbolize either the attributes of divine essence or the vast powers of nature as transcending that of individual creatures.
The winged lion, called “‘Nergal,” was also sacred to Anatis and to Beltis, the goddess of war.
CAST OF THE BLACK OBELISK OF SHALMANESER II, King of Assyria 860-824 B. C. The original of black basalt, which is now preserved in the British Museum, was accidentally discovered by Sir Austen Henry Layard at Nimrud, on the site of the Biblical Calah,* about 19 miles below Nineveh. The obelisk is about 7 feet high. The terraced top and the base are covered with cuneiform script containing a record of Shalmaneser’s campaigns nearly to the last year of his long

reign. The upper part is occupied by five compartments of bas-reliefs running in horizontal bands around the four sides, and representing processions of tribute bearers from five nations. Narrow bands between the compartments contain short legends descriptive of the scenes represented. The Black Obelisk and the other monuments of Shalmaneser IT supplement the Biblical narrative We learn from them that he was the first Assyrian king, so far as is yet known, to come into relations with Israel. Among the tribute bearers represented on the obelisk are Israelites, and in the second row is a legend reading, ‘Tribute of Ya’ua, son of Humri: silver, gold, vials of gold, cups of gold, pans of gold, vessels of gold, of lead, scepters for the King’s hand, axes I received.”! In the record of the sixth year of his reign (854 B. C.) Shalmaneser relates his victorious campaign against Benhadad, King of Damascus (in the inscription Dadidri), Ishiluna of Hamat, and their confederate kings. From another inscription engraved by Shalmaneser in the rocks of Armenia it is learned that one of the allies of this great coalition led by Benhadad against Assyria was Ahab, King of Israel (in the Assyrian inscription Ahabbu Sirlai), who had furnished 2,000 chariots and 10,000 soldiers. Neither of these facts—the participation of Ahab in the Syrian league and the payment of tribute to Shalmaneser by Jehu—is recorded in the Bible. This King is not to be confounded with Shalmaneser 1V (727-722 B. C.), who is mentioned in II Kings Xviii, 9, in connection with the conquest of Samaria.’
CAST OF A BELL, the original of which is in the Royal Museum of Berlin. The bell is decorated in bas-relief with the figure of Ea, the Assyro-Babylonian divinity of the ocean, also called the ‘‘ Lord of Profound Wisdom,” and hence considered as the god of science and culture. He is represented in human form covered over by a fish. He is probably identical with the Oannes, described by the Chaldean priest Berosus as the founder of civilization. Through a mistaken etymology of Dagon from Hebrew dag, fish, the Philistine divinity of that name, mentioned in I Samuel v, was thought to have been a fish god and identified with the water god Ea. Dagon was also a divinity of the AssyroBabylonians, known bythe nameof Dagan, but had no connection with the water. He was considered by the Phenicians and, theretore, presumably, by the Philistines also, as the god of agriculture.’ Besides the representation of Ea, there are also on the bell figures of several demons and a priest.

The Hittites (Hebrew Hittim) are derived in the Bible from Heth, son of Canaan, the son of Ham.' They are depicted as an important tribe settled in the region of Hebron on the hill,’ and are often mentioned as one of the seven principal Canaanitish tribes, and sometimes as comprising the whole Canaanitish population.?
From Abraham to Solomon the Hittites came more or less in contact with Israel. Numbers of them remained with the Jews even as late as . the time of Ezra and Nehemiah.‘ Hittite kings are mentioned as settled north of Palestine,® and some scholars distinguish the latter as Syrian Hittites from the Canaanite tribe. Recently the Hittites have been identified with the Cheta of the Egyptian and Chatti of the Assyrian monuments.
From the notices on these monuments it is gathered that this people at an early period constituted a mighty power, dominating, for a time, the territory from the Euphrates to the 4.gean, and standing forth as rivals of Egypt and Assyria. As early as the seventeenth century B. C., a struggle began for supremacy between Egypt and the Hittites, which lasted for five hundred years, when Ramses II defeated the Hittites at Kadesh, on the Orontes. He did not conquer them, however, but was compelled to make an alliance. From the twelfth to the eighth century B. C., the Hittites were in conflict with Assyria, until the Assyrian King, Sargon, put an end to the Hittite dominion in 717 B. C., when the inhabitants of Carchemish, the Hittite capital in Syria (the modern Jerablus on the Euphrates), were deported to Assyria, and the city was repeopled with Assyrian colonists.
Of late there have been added to the Biblical, Egyptian, and Assyrian sources humerous monuments which were discovered throughout
‘Asia Minor and Northern Syria, and which are by some scholars attributed to the Hittites. The beginning was made by two Americans, Mr. J. Augustus Johnson, of the United States consular service, and Rey. 8S. Jessup, who in 1870 found Hittite inscriptions at Hama, in Syria. Later discoveries were made, especially by Humann and Puchstein, under the auspices of the German Government (1872), and by Ramsay and Hogarth (1890). The monuments, mostly of black basalt, contain representations in bas-relief of religions objects, winged figures, deities standing on various animals, sphinxes, gryphons, the winged disk, as symbol of the deity, the two-headed eagle (which became the standard of the Seljukian Turks, and afterwards of Austria and Russia, etc.), and inscriptions in hieroglyphic characters, written in alternating lines from right to left and left to right (boustrophedon). The art exhibited on these monuments is of a primitive, rude character, and
recalls the early art of Babylonia, Greece, and Phenicia.» The inscrip-

tions have not yet been deciphered, and the race affinity of the Hittites and the place of their language among linguistic families are still disputed questions. Thus, J. Halevy' considers the originators of these monuments as Semites; P. Jensen? would designate them as Aryans (Cilicians), while the Italian, Cesare de Cara?’ identifies them with the Pelasgians, the ancient prehistoric inhabitants of the Grecian countries.
The pictorial representations of the Hittites, on the Egyptian as well as on their own monuments, show that they were a short, stout race, with yellow skin, receding foreheads, oblique eyes, black hair, and chin, aS a rule, beardless. They wore conical caps and boots with upturned tips. These characteristics would seem to suggest that they were neither of Semitic nor Aryan origin, but belonged to the Mongolian or Turanian family, and this is as yet the more prevalent opinion. The following casts of Hittite sculptures were shown:
CAST OF A COLOSSAL STATUE OF THE GOD HADAD, inscribed in the old Aramean dialect. (See plate 27.) The original of dolorite, now preserved in the Royal Museum of Berlin, was discovered by von Luschan and Humann at Gertechin, near Senjirl, which is about 70 miles to the northeast of Antioch in northern Syria. The excavations in this region were carried on by these scholars between 1888 aud 1891 under the auspices of the German Oriental committee constituted for that purpose. The most important finds made during these excavations, besides the statue of Hadad, were the stele of Esarhaddon, King of Asyria, 681-668 B.C., bearing an inscription in Assyrian cuneiform writing, and a statue erected by Bar-Rekub to the memory of his father Panammu, King of Samaal, the ancient Semitic name of the region of Senjirli, inscribed, like the statue of Hadad, in the old Aramean dialect. Both these Aramean inscriptions are cut in high relief, ike the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the Hittite monuments. The character of the writing resembles that of the Moabite stone and the language bears a closer resemblance to Hebrew than the Aramaic of the later period.
The statue of Hadad was erected by Panaminu, son of Karul, King of Ja’di, in northern Syria, in the eighth century B. C., to the gods El, Reshet, Rakubel, Shemesh, and above all to Hadad. Hadad was the name of the supreme Syrian deity, the Baal, or Sun god, whose worship extended from Carchemish, the ancient Hittite capital in Syria, to Edom and Palestine.
Many Edomite and Syrian kings bore the name of the deity as a title. In Zachariah xii, 11, there is mentioned a place in the valley of

Megiddo named after the two Syrian divinities ‘* Hadad-Rimmon.” Coins bear the name of Abd-Hadad, “servant of Hadad,” who reigned in the fourth century B. C., at Hieropolis, the later successor of Carchemish, and in the Assyrian inscriptions there occurs the abbreviated form of “Dada, god of Aleppo.” Of the four other divinities named, El became the generic term for deity among Hebrews and Assyrians. Shemesh is the Sun god (Assyrian Shamash). Reshef appears to be a Hittite divinity, while Rekubel is met with here for the first time. The inscription contains thirty-four lines. The first part (lines 1 to 15) contains the dedication of Panammu to the gods to whom the monument was erected, who conferred on him the government over Ja’di, and granted the land plenty and abundance. The second part (lines 13 to 24) relates the injunction of Karul to his son Panammu, that he erect a Statue to Hadad and honor him with sacrifices. The third part (lines 24 to 34) contains the usual curses against those who should destroy, deface, or carry off the monument.!

HITTITE LUTE PLAYER.—Cast from original, of dolerite, at the Royal Museum, Berlin, Germany. Found at Senjirli, Asia Minor. (See plate 8.)
HITTITE LION CHASE. (See plate 36.) This relief, which probably served to decorate the gate of a temple or palace, plainly exhibits Assyrian influence. Ason Assyrian hunting scenes, the lion is chased from a chariot occupied by the charioteer and the archer. In front of the chariot and its spirited horse the lion is attacked by two men, who drive spears in the fore and hind parts of its body. The whole scene combines archaism with vivid and powerful naturalism. The original, of granite, was found at Saktschegézu and is now in the Royal Museum of Berlin, Germany.
HITTITE WARRIOR, with ax and sword. (See plate 37.) Cast from original, of dolerite, at the Royal Museum, Berlin, Germany. Found at Senjirli, Asia Minor. The relief probably served to decorate the gate of a temple or palace.
The last section of the exhibit consisted of a small collection of bibles, arranged so as to show the originals and the versions. It included manuscripts and old and rare editions of the original texts, as well as copies of the most important ancient and modern transla-
tions of the scriptures. This part of the exhibit was not only of
’ 3 :
interest to biblical students, but also served to illustrate the study of palweography.
THE OLD TESTAMENT.—The Old Testament is mainly written in the Hebrew language, which was the Semitic dialect spoken in Canaan. It is cognate to Assyrian, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Aramean, and most closely allied to Phenician and Moabite. Daniel ii, 4, to vii, 28, and Ezra iv, 8, to vi, 18, and vii, 12-26, are written in Aramean; an a few words ir Genesis and Jeremiah.
The canon of the Old Testament is divided by the Jews into three portions— the law, the prophets, and the writings—and subdivided into twenty-four books. Josephus counts twenty-two books, which was followed by Origen. The fixing of the canon goes back by tradition to Ezra and the men of the great synagogue; some, however, are of the opinion that the canonicity of the prophets and writings (Greek hagiographa, or sacred writings) was settled much later. According to the present actual count the Old Testament contains thirty-nine books. This, howcver, does not argue a different content from ancient times— simply a further subdivision of books.
Before the Exile the books were written in the ancient Phenician characters which appear in some ancient Phenician inscriptions, on the Moabite stone, on some coins of the Maccabees, and in the Samaritan Pentateuch. In the period following the Exile and the restoration of Ezra the square letters, also called “Assyrian script,” which are repre

sented in the printed editions of the Old Testamént, had gradually been introduced.
Originally the Hebrew text was written without divisions into chapters and verses, and earlier still, no doubt, without divisions into words. Great care, however, was observed to transmit the text correctly. Josephus asserts that ‘*no one has been so bold as either to add anything to them, take anything from them, or to make any change in them” (the books of the Bible). Philo Judus asserts that “the Jews have never altered one word of what was written by Moses,” and in the Talmud a scribe is exhorted as follows: “My son, take care how thou doest thy work (for thy work is a divine one), lest thou drop or add a letter.”
Nevertheless, it seems likely that errors crept into the text. Accordingly, a body of Jewish scholars known as the Massorites labored for eight centuries (the second to the tenth of the Christian era) to fix the text. They added a number of marginal readings where the text was obscure or faulty, introduced a system of punctuation and accents, and made divisions into chapters, paragraphs, and verses. They counted and recorded the number of sections, verses, words, and even letters contained in the different books. The work of the Massorites on the original text of the Old Testament closes with the schools of Aaron ben Asher in Palestine and Moses ben Napthali in Babylonia, and it is generally admitted that the text has been handed down to us in a comparatively pure and trustworthy form. The oldest complete manuscript of the Old Testament which is known dates from the year 1009 A. D.
THE NEW TESTAMENT.—The New Testament was written in Greek in its Hellenistic idiom. The original handwork of the authors perished early. The oldest manuscripts known date from the fourth century. The canon of the New Testament as it now stands and is accepted by all the churches was fixed by the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397) under the influence of St. Augustine. The present division of chapters in the New Testament was originated by Cardinal Hugo of St. Caro in the thirteenth century; that of the verses was made in imitation of the Old Testament, and is first found in the Latin translation of the Vulgate, and only as late as 1551 was it placed by Robert Stephanus on the margin of the Greek text.
The following specimens were shown:

PRINTED EDITIONS OF THE HEBREW BIBLE.—Soon after the invention of the art of printing parts of the Old Testament were published. Thus the Psalter with Kamchis Commentary appeared in 1477 (place unknown); the Pentateuch with the Targum and the Commentary of Rashi in 1482 at Bologna, Italy. The first complete Hebrew Bible was printed at Soncino, Italy, in 1488. The second edition has neither date nor place. The third was published at Brescia, Italy, in 1494. It was the one used by Luther for his German translation. The present copy shown was a reprint, with slight alterations, of the Bible printed by Daniel Bomberg at Venice in 1517. In this edition the first effort was made to give some of the Massoretic apparatus. It contains, besides the Hebrew original, several of the Chaldean Targums and commentaries. The editor was Felix Pratensis.

HEBREW BIBLE, edited by Elias Hutter (three volumes), Hamburg, 1587.—Hutter was professor of Hebrew at Leipsic. The peculiarity of this Bible consists in the fact that the roots are printed in solid blaek letiers, whereas the prefixes, suffixes, and formative letters (called servile letters in Hebrew grammar) are shaded.
THE HEBREW BIBLE, first American edition (see plate 41), published by Thomas Dobson, Philadelphia, 1814 (two volumes), printed by William Fry.—In 1812 Mr. Horwitz had proposed the publication of this edition of the Hebrew Bible, the first proposal of this kind in the United States. Early in 18135 he transferred his right and list of subseribers to Mr. Thomas Dobson. The work was advertised as follows in “ Poulson’s American Daily Advertiser,” Monday, May 30, 1814:
Hebrew Bible This day is published, By Thomas Dobson,
No. 41, South Second Street The First American Edition of The Hebrew Bible, Without the Points.
Elegantly printed by William Fry, with a new fount of Hebrew Types, cast on purpose for the work by Binney & Ronaldson, on the best superfine wove paper, two large volumes octavo.
Price in boards, Fifteen Dollars.
Subscribers will receive their copies at Subscription Price by applying to Thomas Dobson as above. This arduous undertaking the first of the kind attempted in the United States is now happily accomplished. The work is considered as one of the finest specimens of Hebrew Printing ever executed: and it is hoped will be generally

encouraged by the Reverend Clergy of different denominations, and by other lovers of the Sacred Scriptures in the Hebrew Language.
POLYCHROME EDITION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, edited by Prof. Paul Haupt, since 1892.—Some modern scholars are of the opinion that . some of the books of the Old Testament as they now stand in the received text of the Massorites are composed of several sources. A company of these scholars under the editorial supervision of Prof. Paul Haupt is preparing an edition, representing by various colors the component parts as well as the portions which they consider as later additions.
LEICESTER CODEX OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. Facsimile. Original preserved in the archives of the borough of Leicester, England.— It is written in cursive script (i. e., in a continuous running hand), and is usually ascribed to the eleventh century. In the opinion of Prof. J. Rendel Harris the manuscript is of Italian origin, and no earlier than the fourteenth or even the fifteeenth century.
GREEK AND LATIN NEW TESTAMENT OF ERASMUS. (See plate 42.) Editio princeps. Printed by Frobenius in Basel, 1516.—The first complete book produced by the printing press was a Latin Bible in 1456. The Greek New Testament was first printed in the Complutensian Polyglot (so called from the Latin name of Alcala, Spain, where it was printed) of Cardinal Ximenes in 1514, but it was not issued until 1520. The edition of the Greek New Testament, by Erasmus, was, therefore, the first ever published, and became, with a few modifications, the received text printed by Elzevir in Leiden. Luther’s translation was based uponit. To the Greek original Erasmus added a corrected Latin version with notes.
GREEK ‘TESTAMENT. (See plate 43.) First American edition. Printed by Isaiah Thomas, 1800, Worcester, Massachusetts.
GREEK TESTAMENT. The second issued in America. Printed at Philadelphia by S. F. Bradford, 1806.
Translations of the Scriptures became necessary when the Jews were dispersed in the Greco-Roman world and gradually abandoned the use of the Hebrew language, and later when Christianity was propagated among various nations. The oldest and most important version of the Old Testament, which in its turn became the parent of many other translations, is the Greek of Alexandria, known by the name of the Septuagint. The name Septuagint, meaning seventy, is derived from the tradition that it was made by a company of seventy (or rather seventy-two) Jewish scholars, at Alexandria, under the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, 285-247 B. C., who desired a copy for the library he was gathering. The truth of its origin seems to be that Alexandria became, after the Babylonian captivity, a center of Jewish

population. As time went on the Jews lost command of the Hebrew language and required a translation of their sacred books into Greek. The men who met this want differed very much in know edge and skill, were of an indeterminate number, and of different periods, beginning the work at the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus and ending it about 150 B.C. The Pentateuch is much more carefully translated than the rest of the Bible. Books now considered apocryphal were included in the canon. The Septuagint was used by the Jews until the second century of the Christian era, when they reverted to the Hebrew. It was also, no doubt, used by the Apostles and by the Church Fathers, who refer to it under the name of ‘“ Vulgata.”
TARGUM OR ARAMEAN TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, Parallel edition of the Pentateuch with the Hebrew text and various Hebrew commentaries, Vienna, 1859.—Targum, which means translation, is a name specifically given to the Aramean versions. They are supposed to owe their origin to the disuse of the Hebrew tongue by exiles in Babylon. They were at first oral, and arose from the custom of having the law read in Hebrew and then rendered by the official translator (Jeturgeman, English dragoman) into Aramean. The best Targum is that which passes under the name of Onkelos, who lived about 70 A. D. It is, however, generally assumed that, in its present Shape at least, it was produced in the third century A. D.in Babylonia. That ascribed to Jonathan ben Uziel, which originated in the fourth century A. D. in Babylon and is only extant on the Prophets, is more in the nature of an homiletie paraphrase, while the so-called Jerusalem Targum (‘‘Pseudo-Jonathan”) was probably not completed till the seventh century.
FACSIMILE OF MANUSCRIPTS OF THE SEPTUAGINT, ascribed to 300 A. D.—The original is an Egyptian papyrus now at Vienna. It consists of sixteen sheets written on both sides, and contains the greater part of Zechariah from the fourth chapter and parts of Malachi. It is written in uncial characters (capitals) and contains no divisions between the words.
FACSIMILE OF THE CODEX VATICANUS, containing the Old and New Testaments, in six volumes. Rome, 1868-1881.—The Codex Vaticanus, so called from the fact that it is preserved in the Vatican at Rome, is the best and oldest Biblical manuseript now known. It is written in Greek, in uncial characters, and was probably the work of two or three scribes in Egypt during the fourth century. The original is probably the most valuable treasure of the Vatican Library. It was brought to Rome by Pope Nicholas V in 1448. The manuscript is not quite complete; there are a few gaps in the Old Testament, and the New Testament ends with Hebrews ix, 14.
CoDEX SINAITICUS. Facsimile edition, St. Petersburg. Four volumes, 1862.—The Codex Sinaiticus was discovered in 1859 by Constantine Tischenforf in the Convent of St. Catharine at the foot of Mount

<<<Page: 1418>>>

Sinai. It was transferred to Cairo, then to Leipsic, and later to St. Petersburg, where it is preserved in the Imperial Library. His text was printed in Leipsic from types especially cast in imitation of the original and published at St. Petersburg at the expense of Czar Alexander II. The original is on parchment, written in uncial characters, four columns to a page, and forty-eight lines on a page. It dates from the middle of the fourth century. It contains the greater part of the Old Testament and the whole of the New Testament. Four different scribes were employed in its writing.
CoDEX ALEXANDRINUS. Printed in type to represent the original manuscript. London, 1816.--This facsimile version of the Alexandrian or Egyptian text of the Bible appeared in 1816 in four volumes, Volwnes I-III containing the Old Testament and Volume IV the New Testament. It contains the whole Bible, with the exception of a few parts. The original manuscript was presented to King Charles I by Sir Thomas Roe, from Cyril Lucar Patriarch, of Constantinople. It was transferred to the British Museum in 1753. It is written on parchment in uncials, without division of chapters, verses, or words. Tradition places the writing of this manuscript in the fourth century, but it is now generally assumed to date from the fifth century.
THE VULGATE OR LATIN BIBLE.—The Vulgate goes back to a Latin translation. made from the Septuagint, in North Africa, in the second century, and known as the Vetus Latina or “Old Latin.” A revised form of this translation was current in Italy toward the end of the fourth century, and was known as the Itala or “Italic.” The present version, however, is due to St. Jerome (Hieronymus), and was made by him in Bethlehem between 383 and 404 A. D. It was for a long time the Bible of the Western Church and of a large part of the Eastern Church. St. Jerome began the revision of the Old Testament with the book of Psalms, of which he produced three copies known as the Roman, Gallican, and Hebrew Psalters. But of the rest of the Old Testament he made a new translation from the original Hebrew, with which he was well acquainted. The translation. is commonly called the Vulgate, a name which was originally given to the Septuagint. It is still in use by the Roman Catholic Church. It was printed by Gutenberg between 1450 and 1455, being the first important specimen of printing with movable types.
Syriac OLD TESTAMENT. Edited by 8S. Lee and printed at London, 1825.—The oldest Syriac version of the Bible is the Peshitta (‘‘ correct” or ‘‘simple”), the most accurate of the ancient translations. It is referred to in the Commentaries of Ephraim the Syrian, in the fourth century, and was already at that time an old book.
The whole translation was made from the Hebrew, but the translators were free in their renderings, and seem also to have been acquainted with the Septuagint.

Coptic NEw TESTAMENT.—Manuscript of the seventeenth century, Cairo, Egypt. Coptic was the language of the Egyptian Christians. It is a development from the ancient hieroglyphic language, with an admixture of Greek words, and continues to the present day to be used in the services of the Christian Church in Egypt. There were differences in the dialects spoken in different parts of the country, and so there are three Egyptian translations of the Bible—the ‘Thebaic or Sahidie, the Memphitiec or Bahiric, commonly called the Coptic, and the Bashmuric. They all probably date from the second century and are made after the Septuagint. The present manuscript contains St. Mark in the Bahirie dialect.
ETHIOPIC VERSION OF THE BrBLE.—Photograph of original Bible, preserved in the United States National Museum. This copy was obtained from King Theodore, of Abyssinia, by Lord Napier, and by him presented to General Grant. The Ethiopic version was made from the Septuagint in the fourth century. probably by Frumentius, the apostle of Ethiopia. It has forty-six books in all, containing, in addition to the Canon, a large number of Apocryphal books.
ARABIC VERSION OF SAADIA GAON.—In Hebrew characters. The Peniateuch, edited by J. Derenbourg, Paris, 1893. Saadia Gaon was born at Fayum, A. D. 892, and died in 942. His translation of the Bible is rather a paraphrase, and has a high exegetical value.
ARABIC BIBLE.—Manuscript. (See plate 44.) Complete Old Testament, neatly written and well preserved. Dated by scribe 1560, A. D. Cairo, Egypt.
ARABIC NEW TESTAMENT.—Contains the Epistles and Acts, the last five verses of the Acts wanting. Sixteenth century, Cairo, Egypt.
THE New TESTAMENT, TRANSLATED BY JOHN WYCLIFFE about 1380; printed from a contemporary manuscript by William Pickering, London, 1848. John Wycliffe was born in Yorkshire about 1320. He studied at Baliol College, Oxford, and was for some time master of that college. He became later rector of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire, and was the foremost leader of the reform party. He died in 1384. About 1380 he undertook, with the assistance of some of his followers, especially Nicholas Hereford, the translation of the entire Bible into English from the Latin of the Vulgate. It was the first complete English Bible. His translation was, after his death, revised by one of his adherents. The present copy is assumed to represent the first version prepared by Wycliffe himself, or at least under his supervision.
TYNDALE’S NEW TESTAMENT. Facsimile by IF. Fry.—William Tyndale was born between 1484 and 1486 in Gloucestershire. He was educated at Oxford and afterwards at Cambridge. He went to Hamburg and later joined Luther at Wittenberg, where he finished the translation of the New Testament into English. The first edition was

<<<Page: 1422>>>

issued in 1525. It was the first English translation made from the Greek, and it became the basis of all subsequent ones. It was also the first part of the Scriptures printed in the English language. In 1530 the translation of the Pentateuch was issued. His English style was very good and was largely retained in the Authorized version. His translation was condemned by the English bishops, and was ordered to be burned. Tyndale was strangled for heresy at Antwerp in 1536, and his body burned.
THE GOTHIC AND ANGLO-SAXON GOSPELS, with the versions of Wycliffe and Tyndale. Arranged by Rev. Joseph Bosworth, London, 1865.—The Gothie version was made in the fourth century by Bishop Ulfilas, born 318 A. D., died about 381. It is said to have been a complete version, with the exception of the Book of Kings. It was probably completed about 360 A. D. Only fragments are preserved in the so-called Codex Argenteus, or “Silver Book,” in the library of the University of Upsala, Sweden. The Anglo-Saxon version was begun by King Alfred, who translated the Psalms in the ninth century. The translation now extant dates to the tenth century.!
COVERDALE’S BIBLE. Reprint by Baxter, 1838.—Miles Coverdale was born at Coverham, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, 1488. He died at Geneva in 1569. His Bible was issued October 4, 1535, being the first complete Bible printed in the English language. It was not translated from the original tongues, but was based chiefly on the Latin version and on Luther’s Bible. It was undertaken at the wish of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, and dedicated to Henry VIII.
THE GENEVAN VERSION. Folio edition, printed at London, 1597,— This translation was made by English exiles during the reign of Mary, who took up their residence at Geneva. William Whittingham acted as editor, and his assistants were Thomas Cole, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson, and Bishop Coverdale. Some add John Knox, John Bodleigh, and John Pullain, and state that the translators consulted Calvin and Beza. The first edition was printed at Geneva in 1560. It was printed at the expense of John Bodley, father of the founder of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. It was the most popular Bible until superseded by the Authorized version, and was that brought to America by the Pilgrim Fathers. The division of chapters into verses, which had been introduced by Whittingham, from Stephanus’s edition of 1551, was here for the first time adopted for the English bible. The text of the Bible is accompanied by explanatory comments on the margin. It is sometimes called the “Breeches” Bible because of the substitution in Genesis iii, 7, of the rendering ‘‘ breeches” for “‘ aprons” of the other English version.
KING JAMES OR AUTHORIZED VERSION. Folio edition, printed at London by Robert Barker, 1615.—The preparation of a new English Bible was decided upon at a conference held at Hampton Court January
1 For Wycliffe’s and Tyndale’s translations see above.

<<<Page: 1423>>>

16 and 18, 1604. In that year King James I issued a commission to fifty-four eminent divines to undertake the work. It was not begun, however, until 1607, when seven of the original number had died. The forty-seven survivors were divided into six committees, two sitting at Oxford, two at Cambridge, and two at Westminster. In 1610 their work was completed, and then revised by a committee of six. Although universally known as the Authorized version, no record, either ecclesiastical or civil, has ever been found of such authorization. The first edition was printed by Robert Barker in 1611.
THE REVISED VERSION.—The increased knowledge concerning the original texts of the Scriptures, especially of the Greek New Testament, which resulted from the discovery of old manuscripts led to the desire for a revision of the Authorized version which was based upon the received text of Erasmus and Stephanus and exhibited many discrepancies from the emended original text. Such a revision was early advocated by men like Bishop Ellicott, Archbishop Trench, and Dean Alford. Efforts were also made from time to time in the House of Commons to have a royal commission appointed. In 1870 the upper house of the Canterbury Convocation, on the motion of Bishop» Wilberforce, took the subject in hand and instituted the proceedings which finally secured the accomplishment of the work. In 1871 an American committee of cooperation was organized. The New Testament was completed in 1881 and the Old Testament in 1885.
PARALLEL NEW TESTAMENT. Revised version and Authorized version. (Seaside Library.) The Revised version of the New Testament appeared in England May 17,1881, and in America May 20, 1881. The first half of the parallel Testament appeared in New York May 21 and the second half May 23.
THE NEW TESTAMENT, translated by Constantine Tischendorf, Leipzig, 1869. Volume 1000, Tauchnitz series.—This translation was based on the labors of Tischendorf in revising the Greek text, largely due to his discovery of the Sinaitic Codex. It points out many errors in the Authorized version, and undoubtedly paved the way for the Revised version.
LUTHER’S BIBLE. German translation, made by Martin Luther. Edition of 1554.—The New Testament appeared in 1522 and the Old Testament in parts between 1523 and 1532. The complete Bible appeared in 1534, Previous to Luther’s version there were in use at least ten distinct German versions, literal translations of the Latin Bible. Luther worked from the original tongues, and yet succeeded in giving the Bible a real German dress and a style that would appeal to German readers. Luther's translation was of prime importance in assisting the progress of the Reformation, and is also the foundation of the German literary dialect.
SPANISH OLD TESTAMENT. Amsterdam, Holland, 1661 A. D, (5421 A. M.).—The first edition of this translation was printed in the middle

<<<Page: 1424>>>

of the sixteenth century. It bears the title ‘‘The Bible in the Spanish language, translated word for woid from the Hebrew, examined by the Inquisition, with the privilegium of the Duke of Ferrara.” It is therefore generally known as the Ferrara Bible. The copies of this translation are divided into two classes—one appropriate for the use of the Jews, the other suited to the purposes of the Christians. The translation is extremely literal, and the translator has indicated with an asterisk the words which are in Hebrew equivocal, or capable of different meanings.
ELI01’s INDIAN BIBLE. (See plate 45.) Facsimile reprint. Washington, D.C.,1890.—John Eliot, ‘‘the apostle of the Indians,” was born in England in 1604 and received his education at Cambridge. In 1631 he removed to America and settled at Roxbury, Massachusetts, as minister, where he remained until his death, in 1690. He became interested in the conversion of the Indians of New England, whom he believed to be the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, and determined to give them the Scriptures in their tribal tongue, which was the Natick dialect. He completed the translation of the New Testament in 1661 and that of the entire Biblein 1663. It was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson, ‘‘ordered to be printed by the Commissioners of the United Colonies in New England, At the Charge, and with the Consent of the Corporation in England For the Propagation of the Gospel amongst the Indians in New England.”
Eliot’s Indian Bible was the first ever printed in America, and the entire translation is stated to have been written with one pen. Eliot also published an Indian grammar and a number of other works, mostly relating to his missionary labors. The Natick dialect, in which the translation of the Bible was made, is now extinct.
MINIATURE BrtBLE.—The smallest complete edition printed from type. Version of 1611.
CROMWELL’S SOLDIER’S POCKET BIBLE. Facsimile reprint. Compiled by Edmund Calamy and issued for the use of the army of the Commonwealth, London, 1643.—It has frequently been stated that every soldier in Cromwell’s army was provided with a pocket Bible, and it was supposed that an especially small copy was used. In 1804 the late George Livermore, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, discoyered that the Bible which Cromwell’s soldiers carried was not the whole Bible, but the soldier’s pocket Bible, which was generally buttoned between the coat and the waistcoat, next to the heart. It consists of a number of quotations from the Genevan version (all but two from the Old Testament) which were especially applicable to war times. Only two copies of the original of this work are known to be in existence— one in America and the other in the British Museum. The work was reissued in 1693 under the title “‘The Christian Soldier’s Penny Bible.” The only copy known to be extant is in the British Museum.’

HIEROGLYPHIC BIBLE. (See plate 46.) Published by Joseph Avery, Plymouth; printed by George Clark & Co., Charleston, 1820.—A number of hieroglyphic Bibles have been printed in America, the first being that of Isaiah Thomas, at Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1788. Words in each verse are represented by pictures, the whole being designed “to familiarize tender age in a pleasing and diverting manner with early ideas of the Holy Scriptures.”!
BisHop ASBURY’S TESTAMENT, with hundreds of the texts for his sermons marked in his own handwriting.—Francis Asbury, born in Staffordshire 1745, died in Virginia 1816, was the first bishop of the Methodist Church ordained in America. He was sent as a missionary by John Wesley in 1771, atfd in person organized the work of his denomination in the entire eastern portion of the United States, performed the first ordination in the Mississippi Valley, and in 1784 founded the first Methodist college.
THOMAS JEFFERSON’S BIBLE, consisting of texts from the Evangelists, historically arranged.—This book bears the title, ‘The life and morals of Jesus of Nazareth, extracted textually from the gospels, in Greek, Latin, French, and English.” Four versions were employed. The passages were cut out of printed copies and pasted in the book. A concordance of the texts is given in the front and the sources of the verses in the margins. The section of the Roman law under which Jefferson supposed Christ to have been tried is also cited. All of these annotations, as well as the title page and concordance, are in Jefferson’s own handwriting. Two maps, one of Palestine and another of the ancient world, are pasted in the front. Jefferson long had the preparation of this book in mind. On January 29, 1804, he wrote from Washington to Dr. Priestley: ‘‘I had sent to Philadelphia to get two TestamentS (Greek) of the same edition, and two English, with a design to cut out the morsels of morality and paste them on the leaves of book.” Nearly ten years later (October 13, 1813), in writing to John Adams, he stated that he had for his own use cut up the gospels ‘verse by verse” out of the printed book, arranging the matter which is evidently His (Christ’s). In the same letter he describes the book as “the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man.”
1The American editions are not described in W. L. Clousten’s splendid work on Hieroglyphic Bibles.

By WALTER Houau, Ph. D., Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Museum.
The completeness of the collection of Eskimo lamps in the National Museum, showing as it does examples from nearly every tribe from Labrador to the Aleutian Islands, renders it possible to treat them monographically.
This paper is one of a series in course of preparation under the general subject of heating and illumination from the standpoint of the ethnologist.
It is scarcely necessary to remark upon the inhospitable surroundings of the Eskimo or the rigor of the climate reflected in their cavelike houses. One is forced to recognize that in this region the need for warmth and light is only second to the prime need for food. This fact appears in the diet and clothing of the natives, in the nonconducting structure of the house, in the plan of the burrow-like entrance and in the height of the sleeping benches around the hut, which designedly or from instinct are so placed as to take advantage of the heated air collected under the ceiling. Thus Schwatka says that the “‘ Netschillik Innuit, who inhabit the mainland opposite King William’s Land, have the warmest igloos in the Arctic, as they are very low. The heat of the lamp and of the body keeps them very warm.”!
At the same time there is a question whether the bodily temperature of the Eskimo is higher than that of the Europeans. Observations made at North Bluff on the Hudson Strait show that the mean temperature of the party in December and July was 98.1° and 97.7°, while that of the Eskimo for the corresponding dates was 100.2° and 98,4°.?
The observations of Dr. Green, of the Thetis, which prove that the summer temperature of the Eskimo differs little from the normal (98.4°), lead him to the conclusion that the latitude makes inappreciable difterence in animal heat and that the nature of the food supply of the Eskimo is sufficient to counteract the effect of natural forces.’ To

render the observations complete, however, the winter temperature of these Eskimo should be had for comparison.
Though the Eskimo live at a temperature of zero Fahrenheit, travelers have noticed their idiosyncrasy with regard to cold. The clothing is designedly left open at intervals around the waist and the bare skin exposed to the cold air. As a rule the Eskimo strip when in the house and sleep naked. Another indication of their feverishness is the consumption of great quantities of ice-cold water.
No explorer has failed to notice the Eskimo lamp, around which the whole domestic life of this people seems to focus. Far more remarkable than being the unique possessors of the lamp in the Western Hemisphere, the Eskimo presents the spectacle of a people depending for their very existence upon this household belonging. Indeed, it is a Startling conclusion that the lamp has determined the occupancy of an otherwise uninhabitable region by the Eskimo, or, in other words, the distribution of a race.!
The extent to which the lamp has entered into Eskimo life as a social factor is very great. It is essentially the care and possession of the women, peculiarly a sign of the social unit, and though several families may inhabit the same igloo each maternal head must have her own lamp. ‘A woman without a lamp” is an expression which betokens, of all beings, the most wretched among the Eskimo. Dr. Bessels likewise remarks that the lamp is necessary for the existence of the female head of the family. The lamp is placed in the woman’s grave.’
Dr. Bessels maintains that, in spite of Christianity and civilization, the Eskimo is not willing to part with the lamp; but as long as he is in possession of it he will be Eskimo in each one of his pulse beats, for where this lamp exists cleanliness is impossible.” Nansen also remarks upon the persistence of the lamp, even in houses in larger settlements, where Danish stoves are found. The soapstone cooking pots, however, have been superseded by iron pots.’
The high death rate among the Eskimo is attributed by Dr. Bessels to the carbon particles sent off by the lamp, which penetrate the air cells of the lungs.’
The excess of carbon dioxide and the general bad air of the huts must be very detrimental to health. In the spring when the thawing begins the huts are almost uninhabitable, but the people are compelled to stay in them, as it is too early to take to the tents. This is the time of greatest sickness. Hall relates that seventeen persons slept in a snow hut 10 feet in diameter. ‘In the morning, between the hours of 3 and 4, the men waked, ate a quantity of deer meat, smoked, and again
'The migration of peoples effected by the knowledge of making fire artificially will be discussed in another section of the general work.

went to sleep. At 5 the whole party were aroused to find that the lamp smoke during the night had covered them with soot.” Hall waked with a severe headache from the “excess of carbonic acid gas generated by three fire lights and seventeen persons.” !
Not the least value of the lamp to the Eskimo is the light which it aftords. Simpson remarks that the Eskimo never seem to think of fire as a means of imparting warmth,’ and Kane observes that their lamps are used for cooking, for light, for melting snow, and for drying clothes, rather than to warm the air.’ Nevertheless, the lamp does afford considerable warmth, as Simpson admits in another place. Light, however, is highly necessary during the long darkness of winter and the darkness of the Eskimo dwelling. Nansen has several times remarked that the Eskimo do not sleep in the dark like other people.t| Perhaps the inconvenience of rubbing out fire with the fire drill to relight the lamp is one reason. Likewise the feeling of companionship, security, or sociability given by light is appreciated by the Eskimo in common with all other human beings. These instinctive feelings determined in no small degree man’s first overtures to his fire ally.
The lamp is not the sole fire of the Eskimo, for in a very few localities where fuel can be obtained fires are made in the open air or in the middle of the tent for cooking in summer. The fuel used is peat or guano furnished by gulls in Kast Greenland, or the Arctic willow, driftwood, or grass in other sections. In some places, though fuel can be obtained, it is not burned. However, the open fire is only an incident, and the whole’? Eskimo race depend on the large lamps or oil burners made of stone which form part of the furniture of every hut.°
Kumlein describes a curious oven used at Cumberland Gulf. ‘In summer especially, when on hunting excursions, they very often ‘fry’ meat by making a little fireplace of stones and laying a flat piece of stone on top. The opening to receive the fuel supply is to windward. For fuel, at sueh times, they use Cassiope tetragona and Ledum palustre; these shrubs make a quick and very hot fire. It would be comparatively an easy task for these people to gather enough Cassiope tetragona during the summer to burn during the coldest weather, and not rely wholly on blubber.”* The Eskimo hut may be likened to an inhabited oven with the lamp as its internal heat. Theutilization of the heatis as complete as in the Samovar. The ae is placed upon its support, above it han nes the

cooking pot, and above this, suspended from the ceiling, the frame of slats, network of thongs, or pegs, on which are placed articles to dry in the ascending warm air. Thus the lamp, which has a single function in other parts of the world, has added among the Eskimo that of the fireplace and cooking stove. The Eskimo lamp is classifically the homologue of the fireplace in the center of the houses among the majority of tribes in America and Asia.
Hans Egede gives the following description of the lamps of the Greenland communal houses: ‘Though ten or twenty train-lamps burn at once in the houses of the Greenlanders one does not perceive the steam or smoke thereof to fill these cottages. They take care in trimming the lamp, taking dry moss rubbed very small, which they lay on one side of the lamp, which, being lighted, burns very softly and does not cause any smoke if itis not laid on too thick or in lumps. This fire gives such a heat that it not only serves to boil their victuals, but also heats their rooms to that degree that it is as hot as a bagnio. But to those who are not used to this way of firing the smell is very disagreeable.” ! Parry, in his Second Voyage, presents a view of an Eskimo interior which shows in an interesting way the lamp and its appurtenances. (See plate 4.) It is described as follows:
The fire belonging to each family consists of a single lamp or shallow vessel of lapis ollaris, its form being the lesser segment of a circle. The wick, composed of dry moss rubbed between the hands until it is quite inflammable, is disposed along the edge of the lamp on the straight side, and in a greater or smaller quantity lighted, according to the heat required or the fuel that can be afforded. When the whole length of this, which is sometimes above 18 inches, is kindled, it affords a most brilliant and beautiful light without any perceptible smoke or offensive smell. The lamp is made to supply itself with oil, by suspending a long, thin slice of whale, seal or sea-horse blubber near the flame, the warmth of which causes the oil to drip into the vessel until the whole is extracted. Immediately over the lamp is fixed a rude and rickety framework of wood from which their pots are suspended, and serying also to sustain a large hoop of bone, having a net stretched tight within it. This contrivance, called linnetat, is intended for the reception of any wet things, and is usually loaded with boots, shoes, and mittens. The fireplace just described, as situated at the upper end of the apartment, has always, two lamps facing different ways, one for each family occupying the corresponding bedplace. There is frequently also a smaller and less-pretending establishment on the same model, lamp, pot, net, and all, in one of the corners next the door; for one apartment sometimes contains three families, which are always closely related, and no married woman or even a widow without children is without her separate fireplace.
With all the lamps lighted and the hut full of people and dogs a thermometer placed on the net over the fire indicated a temperature of 38°; when removed 2 or 3 feet from this situation it fell to 32°, and placed close to the wall stood at 23°, the temperature of the open air being at the time 25° below zero. A greater degree of warmth than this produces extreme inconvenience by the dropping from the roofs. This they endeavor to obviate by applying a little piece of snow to the place from which a drop proceeds, and this, adhering, is for a short time an effectual remedy; but for several weeks in the spring, when the weather is too warm for these edifices and still too cold for tents, they suffer much on this account.
1H. Egede, Greenland, London, 1745, p. 116.

<<<Page: 1437>>>

The Eskimo stone pots for cooking are called oot koo seeks. They are made in similar proportion, though of various sizes, corresponding with the dimensions of the lamp that burns under it. Suspended by a line of sinew at each end to the framework over the fire, smoke and oil blackens the stone. Cracked and mended with sinew or rivets of copper, iron, or lead make it quite water-tight.'
There is, however, another side to this picture. Lieutenant Schwatka relates that ‘the Kennepetoo Innuits (around Chesterfield Inlet, especially north of it) use few or no lamps to warm their snow huts, and despite the high beds and low roofs, they are cold, cheerless, and uncomfortable beyond measure. These Innuits are essentially reindeer killers and eaters and lay in an insignificant stock of seal oil to burn in their lamps. Walrus killing is unknown to them. For light they use a piece of reindeer suet laid beside a piece of lighted moss, all being on a large flat stone. The light of the stone lamp in all igloos where it is used is sufficient for all purposes of sewing and repairing. It is certainly equal to the light from three or four kerosene lamps, and with the white snow walls gives ample illumination.”? The same authority writes that the U-quei-sik Salik Innuit around the mouth of Blacks River, who are salmon eaters, are another tribe that dispense with warming their snow houses for want of oil, but they use lamps for light.?
The Eskimo lamp has always been regarded a fixture of the house, subject only to the removals of the family. There are, however, small lamps which are carried by travelers or hunters on journeys whose use is primarily for light, but not less important as a means for lighting the indispensable pipe. This is probably the intent of all the small lamps in collections, except the quite small models, which are children’s toys or those buried with the dead.
The Eskimo lamp is usually a shallow, elliptical vessel of stone, and infrequently of earthenware, clay, bone, or wood. ‘This is perhaps determined by the prevalence of the proper material, and it will be seen later that pottery or clay lamps are found only on the low tundra of the Yukon Delta or St. Lawrence Island. Whenever soapstone can be had the lamp is invariably of that material, according to an old custom. Soapstone is easily carved, free from flaws, absorbs and retains heat, giving it up to melt the fat, to keep the oil fluid, and to supply the wick. lxtraordinarily long journeys are made to secure soapstone. Dr. Boas* records that the Central Eskimo made journeys sometime lasting several years in quest of soapstone, which is found in a few places, and rarely in pieces large enough for the manufacture of lamps or pots. The same is true of localities in Alaska. Soapstone was thus one of the most prominent features of the trade and inter-

course among the Eskimo tribes. The southern Eskimo of Alaska, notably at Kadiak and the Peninsula, made their lamps of very hard dioritic rock.
It is quite probable that the ancient lamps were fashioned with stone tools at the quarry, in order to save weight in transport. The Kadiak lamps mentioned above show plainly the marks of the stone hammer used in reducing them to shape by pecking. Substitutes for the lamp and cooking pot are sometimes made by Eskimo women from slabs of stone, which they cement together with a composition of seal’s blood, rlay, and dog’s hair applied warm, the vessel being held at the same time over the flame of a lamp, which dries the cement to the hardness of stone.’ In fact, a slab of stone, a piece of fat, and some moss for a wick form an extempore lamp on occasions.2 In this view the rude Aleut lamps figured on plate 42 are such makeshifts. In connection with this, Nansen tells of an Eskimo who, being detained overnight on a journey, made a saucer serve as a lamp.’ Frequently the lamp follows the outline of the original piece of soapstone, where the greatest possible reservoir capacity is required in the given slab.
Necessarily the lamp and cooking vessels are sometimes broken. Their repair is a good example of Eskimo ingenuity, effected by a cement of blood, clay, and hair, or a strong sewing of sinew. Several lamps and pots in the United States National Museum have been repaired by this method.
Seal oil is preferred for burning in the lamp, though any animal fat may be used. Capt. EH. P. Herendeen informs the author that the Ootkiahviemute carry for trading, seal oil put up in pokes of the skin of the animal itself, prepared for the purpose. These skins so made up contain about 25 gallons of oil. The interior natives and river tribes are dependent upon the coast people for oil to burn in their lamps, as the small amount of fat which the reindeer yields is insufficient for the long arctic nights. :
The lamp eats like a native; successful hunting means cheer and comfort in the hut of these sociable people during the winter. The economy of oil is often forced upon the Eskimo, for starvation and darkness is a frequent and near-by exigency. Schwatka says that he has known cases where the Eskimo were extremely anxious to economize oil needed to melt ice for drinking water, in wuich six or seven wells were dug through thick ice, before they gave up the attempt or were successful.* Every particle of fat is saved on principle.
The women scrape sealskins with a scoop of ivory, which is one of the accompaniments of the lamp.’ There is also nearly always pro-

vision for saving the oil which may drop from the lip of the lamp. To keep the floor clean to prevent the lamp sinking into the snow, thus getting out the level and also conducting away the heat of the stone, a support is placed under it. This may consist of pegs of wood or pieces of bone stuck in the snow, a wooden block hollowed to catch the oil, or a block with three legs forming a stool. The forms will be figured later in the detailed description of the lamps by localities. No especial device for tipping the lamp in order to increase the supply of oil to the wick has been noticed. This is accomplished in a rude way by altering the position of the lamp on the supports, or by raising the rear support. Many lamps from their form incline toward the wick at a low angle. (See plate 17.)!
The oil is placed in the shallow reservoir and the supply is sometimes kept up by suspending a piece of blubber near the flame. The fat nearly always needs some preparation before being put into the lamp. This is effected among the Central Eskimo by beating the blubber to break up the fat globules, allowing the oil to come out as soon as itis melted. In summer the blubber is chewed and ejected into the lamp.”
The woman’s knife or wlw and the fat scrapers which have been the subjects of two valuable papers by Dr. O. T. Mason, are closely associated with the feeding of the lamp.
The ulu is employed for cutting or mincing the blubber and the scoop or scraper for removing the fat from the inner surface of the skins, It is also used to transfer the fat tothe lamp. The oil is allowed to stand level with the lower edge of the wick. The latter is made by rolling compact dried sphagnum moss, willow catskins, or peat between the palms with a small quantity of fat. Women often carry little bags of the prepared moss.* The line of wick is applied in an even ridge along the straight edge of the lamp, which varies in length from 2 to 30 inches in different localities. This may be seen by contrasting the wide lamp of the far north with those of the south at Kadiak and the middle region, which have a very narrow lip. This seems to be due to the smaller need for light in the south, where the arctic night is not so long. However, Asiatic or other influence to the west may be the cause. Sometimes the wick is laid for only a portion of the length when only a small flame is required. Lamps with partitions adjusted and fastened in with cement are found at Point Barrow. Sometimes a large lamp is reduced to five concavities by low septums in order to increase the length of the wick edge when extra flame is needed. The care of the lamp is quite an acquirement. The wick must be dense or
‘A piece of skin is often placed under the lamp as a “catch all.” Many lamps from various countries are made double for this purpose.

the lamp will smoke, and it must be kept in order by means of a trimmer, which is a small piece of bone, stone, or wood. The trimmer dipped in oil forms a torch on occasion.!
Dr. Bessels says that the wick is ignited at one end and the flame skillfully guided with the trimmer across the whole length of the edge. If the quickly charring wick extends too far into the flame, too much heat is taken away from it and it burns with a deep, red light and its external edge is not hot enough to consume the carbon particles which spread themselves as sooty clouds in the hut.’
Lamp trimming only reaches perfection in the old women of the tribe, who can prepare a lamp so that it will give a good, steady flame for several hours, while usually half an hour is the best that can be expected.’ In an Eskimo tradition* a woman takes down some eagle’s feathers from a nail in the wall and stirs up the smoking lamp, so as to make it burn brightly.
While, as a rule, the Eskimo lamp has a shallow, plain, reservoir, simply for holding oil, there are modifications of the reservoir of considerable interest. Some lamps of Cumberland Gulf, of Kast Greenland, of West Greenland, and Point Barrow have a raised portion or step at the rear of the reservoir; probably blubber to be melted gradually is placed upon it. Other lamps have a low ridge just front of the wick edge and parallel with it. This ridge either breaks down at the extremities, allowing the oil to flow around to the wick, or it is perforated or divided by deep cuts into two or three sections for the same purpose. The office of this ridge is to regulate the flow of oil to the wick and to prevent any sudden wash of oil carrying away the wick line. It is apparent that the lamps from St. Lawrence Island (see plate 14) could readily be carried about in the hand if necessary.
The lamp found by Gen. A. W. Greely in the high north has the ridge. Curiously enough it reappears in St. Lawrence Island, in Bering Strait, and among the Chukchis. A trace of the ridge is found in Kast Greenland and in Kadiak Island. These permanent ridges may have some connection with the septums fitted in the lamp of Point Barrow. There is no evidence, however, that they have been used as extra wick edges, as in the case of the Barrow lamps.
The saucer-shaped pottery lamps of the Yukon tundra have no provision for the wick around the edge. Some specimens appear to have been lighted on the edge, and Mr. Nelson assures the writer that this method is followed.
Most observers have spoken in terms of praise of the excellent light given by the Eskimo lamp. The flame in a well-trimmed lamp is from
1The name for torch is nanerut, or nanernag. The only other locality where the name is found is on the Mackenzie River, where it is called nenexeron. The use of the torch is extremely uncommon among the Eskimo.

1 to 2 inches high, very clear and steady. The oil and fat of the northern animal furnish illuminants of the best quality. In the snow houses of the east the white walls reflect the light, adding to its power.
The administration of lighting for public use is very uncommon among the Eskimo, as it was among civilized peoples until recently. Occasionally there is a demand for an increase of light for the illumination of places of assembly where shamanistic or other practices are being carried on.
In an ivory model of skillful workmanship from Nushagak, southern Alaska, exhibited in the United States National Museum, representing a wrestling match in a summer tent, there is a curious chandelier, consisting of two dish lamps placed on the ends of a crossbar and secured by strings to another parallel bar some distance above, the whole being suspended from the framework of the tent by cords. Thelamps have each a tube, which being painted red at the end seem to represent a single wick. This chandelier is unique Gige d).
Another lamp rest, consisting of a crosspiece resting on an upright post, having a lamp fixed at either end is found in a drawing by a native named Namoff from {Kadiak. The lamp is represented as illuminating a shaman’s lodge.'
Long years of misapprehension render it almost useless to combat the popular idea that the Eskimo are by preference eaters of raw flesh. Mr. Murdoch? has pointed out that the Eskimo sometimes eat flesh raw, especially in a frozen state; in the region where fuel is very searce this habit appears to have become fixed. The Eskimo when hunting or on a journey and the Eskimo at home are different persons as to habits. In the hut the pot hanging over the lamp always con-

On ordinary occasions the Eskimo prefers cooked food, for his digestive tract does not differ from that of other members of the human family. Improper eating produces similar effects upon him as upon more civilized people. When food is plenty it is true there is great feasting, and it would seem in the absence of intoxicants the torpor produced by gorging is the only method the Eskimo has of reaching the Nirvana of the civilized. It has been observed that the drinking of pure oil is not practiced with impunity by the Eskimo, who as a rule only take it as medicine.
Kumlein! is sufficient authority for the statement that “when the Eskimo have been simmering meat, especially seal, in their boiling pots, they pour off the liquor and mix it with about an equal quantity of blood; this makes a thick and rather greasy soup that must be quite nourishing; the children are very fond of it. It seems possible that from this dish has originated the popular error that these people

(After Kane.) The Eskimo drink great quantities
of water. It is curious that with its world of sonneehed water the Arctic should be a veritable Sahara. Water is usually supplied by melted snow or ice and the lamp is brought into requisition for the purpose, though sometimes the warmth of the hut is sufficient, especially if the vessel containing snow is placed near the flame. Dr. Kane figures a snow melter of considerable ingenuity which is reproduced here (fig. 2). Sometimes travelers carry watertight pouches containing snow, which they put under the clothing to be melted by the heat of the body.2. Mr. Astrup thus describes a method of melting ice for drinking water: “At the side of the lump of meat stood also a block of ice as clear as a crystal, whence the community obtained water, as in the center of it a cavity had been cut, at the bottom of which a stone was placed about the size of a man’s fist, on which there burned with a good flame a piece of moss intersected with the blubber, and as the ice melted at the sides of the cavity the water collected at the bottom in a small, clear pool, whence it was consumed by the many parched mouths by sucking it up through hollow reindeer imarrow bones.” *

The lamp and its accompanying pot usually agree as to size, the rule being that the length of the pot shall be equal to the length of the wick edge. The drying frame is larger, owing to the size of the articles to be laid upon it, and also because the warm air above the lamp spreads out.
In the huts of hunting parties out on the tundra a skin is hung around the lamp and frame, to better focus the heat for the very necessary drying of the wet garments.'
The rack or net hung over the lamp points out another very important feature of the Eskimo domestic economy. Mittens, boots, and other articles to be dried are put on the rack preparatory to their manipulation and softening by the women. The rack is often made by lashing slats of wood together, or, where wood is scarce, a hoop of wood or bone, crossed by netting, is found. The rack is supported from the ceiling or from the side of the hut, and from it the pot is usually suspended. The rack, however, is not found south of the Arctic circle among the western Eskimo where sticks are driven into the walls, taking the place of the rack.
The value of the lamps in the arts is very great. First in importance is the bending of the wood for snowshoes, boxes, etc., which is accomplished by dipping the wood in water and steaming it over the lamp. Superior work of this kind is done, as the snowshoes and wooden vessels in the United States National Museum bear witness. Ivory, antler, and bone are also bent over the lamp, after a preliminary soaking in urine.” Skins are dried in tanning over the lamp by the Eskimo of Cumberland Gulf. The hardening of the peculiar Eskimo cement has been mentioned. There are doubtless many other applications by which the lamp enters into the arts.
It is not remarkable that the lamp enters also into the religion and folklore of this simple people; there is, however, very little recorded on the subject. Franz boas has collected the most information on this point, which is presented in his valuable work on the Central Eskimo.* In burial, the man’s hunting implements are placed by his side; the pots, lamps, knives, ete., by the side of the woman, and by the child, its playthings.’ Hall observed on a grave a small kettle hung over a lamp. A model of a lamp from a grave in Cumberland Gulf is figured by Dr. Boas and the United States National Museum possesses several from graves in Greenland. This custom has been observed in other localities. The small oblong stones which were found by the late Baron Nordenskjold in northwest Greenland graves and which were lamp

trimmers or rather ordinary torches, may be viewed in this light. Abandoned lamps may be due to the superstition which renders useless the articles in a hut rendered taboo by adeath. The low burning Jamp is also an adjunct of the wizard’s incantations.
In the United States National Museum there is a dance mask of wood in the shape of a human face, surmounted by a rude carving intended to represent the spirit of the Sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), In the head of the crane is a small cavity made to receive a stone oil lamp, the light from which produces a weird effect during the dance. The spirit is visible only to the shaman or sorcerer. The mask is from Rasboinsky, Alaska (Lower Yukon.) !
The constellation of the Great Bear is called by the East Greenlanders pisildlat, lamp foot or stool upon which the lamp is placed.
The typical lamp is that whose form is the result of an attempt to devise a vessel with a long, nearly straight wick edge combined with a reservoir. This necessarily throws the vessel into the clam-shell shape or ellipsoidal shape. Lamps of this character appertain to the high and rigorous north, where the maximum of heat and light are required. No doubt, also, the lamp is modified by the abundance or scarcity of the food supply and the prevalence of driftwood. This form ranges from Labrador to Norton Sound, Alaska. The other general form of lamp, which is circular or ovate, having a narrow wick edge, ranges south from Norton Sound. They are circular and of baked clay on the tundra formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yukon and Kuskokwim river systems. They become oval and of stone in the metamorphie and igneous country to the southeast and southwest through the Alaskan Peninsula and Aleutian Chain. There is a connection of form suggested between the stone lamps spoken of and the stone vessels of the northwest coast of Alaska and British Columbia and the west coast of North America, but there is no connection by use. The Eskimo are unique in the Western Hemisphere in the possession of a lamp.
The clay-saucer lamp of the Yukon tundra is interesting from the fact that it seems an intrusion. It may be true that the alluvial country furnishes no stone, and hence clay is substituted, which will account for the material. The Eskimo will go a long distance, as has been pointed out, for material which he needs and has been accustomed to use. The lamps of St. Lawrence Island, though of pottery and aberrant in form, preserve the long wick line of the Arctic lamp. The shape of the Yukon type, the absence of a definite wick edge or lip, and the method of burning by a wick brought up at the side relate them to the lamps of eastern Asia, or the simple dish lamps of diverse ages and peoples. Kennan speaks of a dish lamp with the wick floating in the oil in the house of the Koraks. The quotation may prove interesting: “The temperature of a Korak tent in winter seldom ranges above 20° or 25° F., and as constant exposure to such a degree of cold would be

at least very disagreeable the Koraks construct around the inner circumference of the tents small, nearly air-tight apartments, called ‘pologs,’ which are separated one from another by skin curtains and combine the advantages of exclusiveness with the desirable luxury of greater warmth. These ‘pologs’ are about 4 feet in height and 6 or 8 feet in width or length. They are made of the heaviest furs sewed carefully together to exclude the air, and are warmed and lighted by a burning fragment of moss floating in a wooden bowl of seal oil.” !
The typical forms of Eskimo lamps are shown on plate 24. Thrown together in this way they furnish at a view the gradation of forms throughout the whole Eskimo area.
The range of the lamp southward from the Aleutian Islands is limited. The only information that a lamp of any description was in use among the Northwest Coast Indians was given the author by Captain Chase, who visited Cape Flattery and Vancouver Island in 1850. Captain Chase says that these Indians used a lamp made from the clam shell, and burned whale blubber or porpoise oil in them, with a bark wick.
Dr. Franz Boas informs the writer that the Jndians of Vancouver often throw oil on the fire from a bottle when they desire more light. Mr. Lucien M. Turner also states that when the Aleuts require more heat they place the bowlder lamp on the ground and lay a piece of cloth or Figs. 3, 4. shreds of grass in the oil and light it, getting a ©LD STONE LAMP (crusie);

for conclusions. There were medieval stone-
grease lamps in use in northern Europe above the oil line, so named by Dr. Taylor. The only example known by the writer is from Scotland and was figured by D. Bruce Peebles.? This lamp (fig. 3) is euriously like those of the Alaskan Peninsula. In the present state of the inquiry it seems the Eskimo lamp forms a homogeneous group differing in administration from any other lamps in the world, the peculiar heritage of this people and necessary to their welfare.
The conclusions reached are that the Eskimo before he migrated from his priscan home had the lamp, this utensil being a prerequisite to migration into high latitude; that one of the most important functions of the lamp is for melting snow and ice for drinking water; that the lamp is

<<<Page: 1446>>>

employed for lighting, warming, cooking, melting snow, drying clothes, and in the arts, thus combining in itself several functions which have been differentiated among civilized peoples.
That the architecture of the house is related to the use of the lamp. The house is made nonconducting and low in order to utilize the heated air.
That the lamp is a social factor, peculiarly the sign of the family unit, each head of the family (the woman) having her lamp.
That the invention of the lamp took place on some seacoast, where fat of aquatic mammals of high fuel value was abundant, rather than in the interior, where the fat of land animals is of low fuel value.
That the typical form of the lamp arises from an attempt to devise a vessel with a straight wick edge combined with a reservoir giving the vessel an obovate or ellipsoidal shape.
Finally, from observation of lamps from numerous localities around the Eskimo shore line, it is concluded that lamps in low latitude, below the circle of illumination, are less specialized than those of higher latitudes. For instance, the lamps of southern Alaska have a wick edge of 2 inches, while those of Point Barrow and northern Greenland have a wick edge of from 17 to 36 inches in width.
It becomes possible, then, to say with some certainty the degree of north latitude to which a lamp appertains, light and temperature being the modifying causes. Driftwood, the fuel supply, and the presence or absence of material from which to construct the lamp must also be considered. The cause of the large lamp coming down so far in latitude on the east is on account of the dipping of the isotherms. The lamps of Labrador are the case in point.
There are three kinds of Eskimo lamps with regard to use. They may be called the house lamp, the traveler’s or summer lamp, and the mortuary lamp, the latter frequently being models. Lamps for melting
snow may also be mentioned. ~The summer lamp is based on a number of specimens which are too large for models or toys, but are of convenient size for carrying on the person. They usually bear marks of useas alamp. Capt. J. O. Spicer, of Groton, Connecticut, has presented a fine example of this kind of lamp to the United States National Museum, and describes its use in the summer when the large house lamp is not necessary and the small lamp supplies light for the pipe. Travelers often carry such lamp for use on journeys.
The larger regions embracing the localities from whence the lamps come which are described in this monograph are Labrador, Cumberland Gulf, Greenland, Mackenzie River, Point Barrow, Kotzebue Sound, St. Lawrence Island, Kastern Siberia, Norton Sound, the Yukon Delta

and region north of Bristol Bay, the Alaskan Peninsula and Kadiak Island, and the Aleutian Chain. The typical outlines from the yarious regions are presented on plate 24.
The lamps of Labrador are invariably of soapstone, which is secured by long journeys into the interior. There are two types, one long and narrow, the other broader; the back is bowed, the ends truncated, the bottom deep, forming a ridge, the section an obtuse angle formed by the junction of two planes; the edges and ends are squared and the wickedge is straight.
Some of the house lamps are very large. They are never balanced, depending upon sapports for adjustment as to position. Smaller lamps for personal use are often balanced.
The drying frames are semilunar, consisting usually of a bowed hoop joined at the ends to a bar and the intervening space netted or crossed with thongs, as in a tennis racket. The frame takes this shape on account of its being supported by pegs driven into the wall of the circular house.
The cooking pots are oblong and heavy, with flat bottom, the walls slanting inward. Grummets for the suspending cords are fastened through holes drilled at the corners.
The Labrador lamps in the United States National Museum were all coliected by Mr. L. M. Turner, who visited the country in 1883-84, His account, edited by Mr. John Murdoch, may be found in the eleventh annual report of the Bureau of Ethnology, where excellent figures may be examined in connection with this monograph.

rately baranced on a very small rounded base area, standing, when placed on a plane surface, in position for burning with a reservoir full of oil. Hence a stand for this lamp is not necessary. This adjustment of the center of gravity has been observed in a number of Eskimo lamps. Length, 174 inches; width, 7% inches; height at back, 4 inches; front, 3? inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador, Collected by L. M. Turner. 90014.
STONE LAMP, ko-thlik. Large lamp of soapstone; crescentic outline with truncated horns. The bottom takes the form of the reservoir, which slopes sharply down from the straight wick edge to the lowest point and then at a low slant to the eurved back, not exhibiting the sharp angle demarking the two planes shown in the small lamps. The wick edge curves very slightly. Around the back and ends a squared edge is worked out. This lamp, which may be taken as the type, must, of necessity, be set in a support of such figure as to incline it forward in order to supply oil to the wick. This is done by placing the lamp on an excavated block of wood or notched sticks. No attempt has been made to smoothly finish this lamp. Length, 20? inches; width, 94 inches; height,4 inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turner, 90251. Plate 1, figs. 4, 5.
CooKING pot. Large, heavy, oblong vessel of soapstone, rather crudely made. The slanting walls are thick and bulged; the bottom is flat. At each of the upper corners blind holes are drilled to meet each other in the thicker walls of the end of the pot, forming an eyelet for the thongs used in suspension of the vessel. Length, 13 inches; width, 8} inches; height, 43 inches.Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turner. 90257. Plate 1, fig. 2.
Cooking pot. Oblong pot, skillfully made of soapstone. The sides are thick, slightly convex, and slant toward the opening; the bottom is flat. At each of the four upper corners a slanting hole is drilled, coming through on the side. Whalebone strips for suspending the pot are passed through the holes and a knot made in the end to secure it. Length, 114. inches; breadth, 53 inches; height, 4 inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turner. 90015.
MopEL OF DRYING FRAMES. The drying frame (90235, Plate 1, fig. 2) consists of a strip of dressed pine wood bent into.,semilunar shape and mortised at the ends into a cross bar. The interspace is crossed with horizontal and vertical strips of rawhide passing through holes in the frame. The support upon which the drying frame rests is formed of two sharpened stakes lashed together at right angles at the larger ends. This support is fixed in the wall of the snow house. The frame, 90236 not figured, is made of a round stick bent into semilunar shape and crossed with netting of string. Length, 74 inches; width, 4} inches. Eskimo of Ungava, Labrador. Collected by L. M. Turner. 90235, 90236.
The lamp supports shown in the lower figures on plate 1 are copies of specimens in the Toronto University Museum, from East Maine, Labrador. They consist of two notched sticks, wedge-shaped at the lower ends for driving into the ground, or of four sticks cut diagonally at the top so placed as to form an equivalent to the notch.
The support in fig. 2 on plate 1 is of wood, hollowed out to receive the lamp.
There is a close resemblance between the lamps of Cumberland Gulf and those of Labrador. The former, however, are narrower and more pointed, the outline viewed from above being elliptic. The material is usually soapstone and the workmanship is excellent. Some of the house lamps are quite large, having a wick edge nearly 2 feet long.

Upon the authority of Capt. J. O. Spicer, of Groton, the class of summer lamps for this locality has been designated. These are small lamps for summer use to furnish light for the pipe and to start fires. The small lamp figured on plate 2, fig. 2, is interesting. It may be compared with the Greenland specimen on plate 7.
The cooking pots are like those of Labrador. No drying frame exists in the United States National Museum from Cumberland Gulf.
DRAWING IN PENCIL, Lamp, pot, dish, woman’s knife for cutting fat, wick trimmer, and a filament of sphagnum moss for the wick; drawn by an Eskimo of Cumberland Gulf. Collected by L. Kumlein. This drawing is very interesting, as showing adjuncts to the lamp, which usually escape the collector. There is, for instance, no wick-trimmer in the large lamp collection of the United States National Museum and the use of the knife and fat scraper in the care of the lamp was not known until it was noticed by Professor Mason in his paper on “Skin dressing.” See Plate 2, fig. 1.
SMALL STONE LAMP, WITH POCKET. Excayvated from soapstone, crescentic in outline. It is balanced on a rounded base, tipping with ease from front to back, but not from side to side. The reservoir is deep, and at the rear a pocket is formed, demarked by a curving wall. The wick edge slants rather sharply down to the floor of the reservoir. The intent of the pocket at the rear is not known; in this specimen it forms a convenient place for insertion of the thumb in remoying or carrying the lamp. The specimen is very neatly finished. In the popwlar account of Dr. Kane’s explorations a lamp of this variety is figured. Length, 32 inches; width, 1% inches; height, } inch. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U.S.N. 29968. Plate 2, fig. 2.
SUMMER LAMP. Of soapstone, semilunar in outline. The shape of the reservoir is triangular, being formed by the meeting of the planes of the back and wick edge at the middle like those of Ungava Bay, Labrador. The bottom is rounded as are all edges. The balance of the lamp is remarkable, the center of gravity causing it to assume the position required for supplying oil to the wick, although resting upon a small, rounded base when moved, Laterally the lamp is stable, antero-posteriorly it moves freely for tipping. The balance is intentional, and this feature is found in several other localities. The name summer lamp denotes its use in summer, when the large house lamp is not necessary and the small lamp supplies light for the pipe, ete.

Sronré LAMP. Roughly hollowed out from amphibolite, elliptic in shape with rounded ends. The bottom follows the curves of the reservoir, which shows a median groove formed by the junction of the planes of the wick portion and rear portion of the lamp. The lamp is not self balancing and hence must have a support. The wick edge is considerably curved. Length, 20 inches; width, 9 inches; height, when level, 3} inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U.S.N. 29964. Plate 3, fig. 2.
STONE LAMP. Large, elliptic lamp, neatly excavated from soapstone. It is very deeply hollowed out, the wick edge nearly straight and smoothly worked. Not being balanced, the lamp requires support. At the ends of the lamp below are slight projections, probably for the reception of forked supports like those in use at Kast Maine. This fine lamp has seen long service, being saturated and glazed with oil. Length, 23 inches; width, 8} inches; height when level, 5 inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A.

higher than the wick edge, has been broken away, and the specimen shows marks of long usage. The bottom is flat and irregular. From the height of the wick edge the lamp must have required to be strongly tipped toward the front when in use. Length, 12} inches; width 6 inches; height, 1} inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U.S. N. 29966.
SMALL LAMP. Made of soapstone, crescentic in outline, with truncated horns. The reservoir is neatly hollowed out, the rear wall forming a lowrim. The lip or wick edge slants rather abruptly to meet the plane of the floor, forming an angle near the front of the lamp (see section) as in the lamps of Labrador. The bottom of the lamp is rounded, and has irregular cavities due to foreign substances in the soapstone. This lamp, from its small size, is probably one used by travelers or in summer. It is not balanced, and hence requires a rest or foot. Length, 74 inches; width, 4 inches; height, 1} inches. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieutenant Mintzer, U.S. N. 29967. Plate 3, fig. 4.
SoaPsTONE pot. Oblong in shape, cut out of soapstone. It is pierced at the corners for suspension. The bottom is flat; the sides incline inward, thus making the opening smaller at the top. This cooking pot in every respect resembles those collected by Mr. L. M. Turnerin Labrador. The specimen has been broken and mended with cement and sinew by the natives. Length, 124 inches; width, 7 inches; height, 3+ inches. Eskimo, Mantilik, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U.S. N. 29969. Plate 3, fig. 5.
STONE POT. Similar in form to No. 29969. The specimen has been mended with whalebone strips. Eskimo, Cumberland Gulf, Canada. Collected by Lieut. W. A. Mintzer, U.S. N.
The lamps of Greenland are made of soapstone and other harder rocks. They are usually elliptic in outline or having the outline of the gibbous moon. The bottom is nearly always flat or slightly curved, as they are placed on stools; sometimes, however, they are set up on pegs. There is little relation in form between the Greenland lamps and those of Labrador or Cumberland Gulf (Baffin Land). The relation is rather between Greenland both east and west and northwestern Alaska. The type of shell-shaped lamps of North Greenland, shown on plate 7, have the same relationship and pass over to Eastern Siberia by way of Saint Lawrence Island. (See plates 4 to 9.)
The cooking pot has walls inclining outward, in reverse to those of the south. Perhaps the finest specimen of soapstone work of the kind in existence is the cooking pot brought from Smith Sound by Dr. Hayes. (See plate 9, fig. 3.)
The drying frame of East Greenland is hung over the lamp, as is the frame used in a tent at Inglefield Gulf (Smith Sound). (See plate 9, fig. 1.) In other localities the frame is placed on pegs driven in the wall over the bench upon which the lamp is installed. Wick trimmers are often a stick of asbestos or pointed piece of soapstone. In East Greenland it is a chisel-shaped piece of iron mounted in a wooden handle. A number of mortuary lamps have been found in South and Hast Greenland.
The view of the interior of an Eskimo snow house in Greenland is interesting, as showing the method of setting up the all-essential lamp

with its accessories. It also emphasizes the strait caused by the almost total lack of wood, bones, antlers, etc., being employed-instead. A snowshoe apparently is made to do duty as a drying frame. Attention is called to the drip-eatcher under the lamp, and the fat suspended by a thong over the heat of the flame. (See plate 4.)
Lamp. Of soapstone; very large and worked out very neatly, the result being a lamp of elegant shape. The bottom is flat and the sides nearly vertical. The reservoir is nearly flat and slopes gradually up to the wick edge, while the rear wall is high. The wick edge curves more than is usual in Eskimo lamps. The lamp has been broken and repaired neatly with sinew and cement. Length, 264 inches; width, 13} inches; height at front, 2+ inches; at back, 34 inches. Eskimo, Repulse Bay. Collected by Capt. C. F. Hall. 10439. Plate 5, fig. 1.
STONE LAMP. Excavated from soapstone, the wick edge slightly curved, the back bowed, forming a shell-shaped dish. The lamp seems to show traces of having been worked with stone tools. The rear wall is nearly vertical; the reservoir neatly hollowed out, being deepest in the middle, gently sloping up to the lip and to therear. A shallow groove has been cut along the inner margin of the lip, for convenience in installing the wick. The stone is worked thin and resembles pottery. Vhe lamp is probably one used in summer or in traveling. It is wider than the Cumberland Gulf type. Length, 7 inches; width, 44 inches; height, ¢ inch. Eskimo, Smith Sound. Collected by Dr. I. I.

Lamp. Of hard stone, smoothly worked out, the corners and edges rounded. The wick edge is curved at the ends; the intervening portion nearly straight. The bottom is rounded and the lamp inclines toward the wick edge. In outline it has the shape of the gibbous moon, This specimen seems to have been taken from an old village site. Length, 8} inches; width, 54 inches; height at rear, 24 inches; at front, 24 inches. South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45845. Plate 5, fig. 3.
SMALL STONE LAMP. Cut from soapstone; roughly elliptic in outline; the bottom flat, heavily scored by the cutting implement. The sides slant upward and outward; the reservoir is deep, the bottom flat, the walls slanting outward. The wick edge is strongly curved, hence the wick seems to have been supplied with oil, only at the middle portion. This is probably asummer or traveling lamp from South Greenland. Length, 6 inches; width, 3} inches; height at front, 14 inches; at rear, 2 inches. Eskimo, South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45844. Plate 5, fig. 4.
MODEL OF LAMP AND COOKING POT, Made by Mik-sang-wah, native of the village of Karnah, 77° 20'N.70° W. These natives are called the most northern Eskimo. Inglefield Gulf, Greenland. Peary Auxiliary Expedition, 1894. Henry G. Bryant. 175705. Plate 6, fig. 1.
Lamp. Large lamp of soapstone, well finished. It is elliptic in outline, the bottom and floor of the reservoir flat, the wick edge thick and lower than the sloping back. Length, 17 inches; width, 7 inches; height at back, 2 inches; at front, 14 inches. Eskimo of Itah, Smith Sound, Greenland. Collected by Dr. Emil Bessels. 126745. Plate 6, fig 2.
STONE LAMP. Rudely excavated from sandstone, probably from a concretion. The edges are broken and worn down, the bottom is rounded but the lamp balances. In general shape it follows the South Greenland type, the character and hardness of the material and its evident age have modified its appearance. Length, 7% inches; width, 5 inches; height, about 2? inches. Eskimo, Greenland. Col° lected by Dr. I. I. Hayes. 504. Plate 7, fig. 1.
Lamp. Of soapstone, neatly worked out, somewhat in the shape of a clam shell, or having the outline of an obtuse equilateral triangle. It is accurately balanced

<<<Page: 1464>>>

in a slanting position and readily tips forward. The walls are thin, the reservow deeply hollowed out and crossed near the front third by a high bridge pierced near the middle at the floor of the reservoir. The large cavity at the rear of the lamp cut oft by the bridge is for the reception of blubber to be melted by the heat of the lamp, and the oil supply to the wick passes through the orifice in the bridge. Length, 8} inches; width (front to back), 73 inches, height at front, 12 inches; at back, 4 inches. Eskimo of South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45846. Plate 7, fig. 2.
Lamp. Large lamp made from coarse cystalline rock, triangular in outline, the bottom flat, the sides rounded, the back much higher than the wick edge. The reservoir is flat and is crossed by a bridge, which breaks down at the ends, allowing the passage of the oil to the wick, The wick edge is curved and is rough from age and use. This lamp is evidently very old. It was probably taken from a village site in a high latitude as it resembles closely the lamp found by General Greely in latitude 82 degrees north. (See Plate 7, fig. 3.) Length, 144 inches; width, 12} inches; height, at front, 2 inches; at rear, 54 inches. Eskimo, North Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45847. Plate 7, fig. 4.
LAMP (PROM GRAVE). Small lamp, rudely cut from soapstone upon Greenland model. It has been in actual use and it is probable that it is a personal lamp, which has been buried with its owner in or on the grave where it was found. (For East Greenland mortuary lamps, see Plate 8, fig. 1.) Length, 5} inches; width, 1{ inches; height, finch. Eskimo, South Greenland. Collected by Goyernor Fencker. 63908.
SMALL LAMP (MODEL). Made of soapstone for Dr. Hayes. South Greenland. Collected by Dr. I. I. Hayes. 176065. Plate 8, fig. 2.
Lamp. Of soapstone, ovate in outline; reservoir slants regularly from wick edge to the bottom of low back wall; the convex wick edge has a ridge running around it between the outer edge and the reservoir, forming a groove in which the wick was installed. The lamp rests upon a flat bottom and stands level, the rim of the back wall being of the same height as the wick edge. Length, 8 inches; width, 5 inches; height, 2} inches. Eskimo, East Greenland. Collected by Capt. Gustav Holm. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 168942. Plate 8, fig. 3.
SOAPSTONE PoT. With rounded ends and flat bottom; oblong. The wall flares outward from the base, and in the four corners holes are driiled through which are passed the ends of seal-skin cords secured by knots. These loops are for suspension of the pot over the lamp 168942. The pot is neatfy finished and the sides tolerably thin. Length, 8 inches; width, 43 inches; height, 4,'; inches. Eskimo of East Greenland. Collected by Capt. Gustay Holm. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 168943. Plate 8, fig. 3.
Moss For Wick. Dense mass of moss, sphagnum sp., from which the wick for the lamp is prepared. The moss is usually prepared by rubbing between the palms of the hands at the same time incorporating a little oil. This powdered moss is kept in a bag or other receptacle for subsequent use. Eskimo, East Greenland. Collected by Capt. Gustav Holm. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 168944.
DRYING FRAME FOR LAMP 168942. Oblong frame made up of thirteen rounded, parallel strips of pine wood cut out with a knife, mortised into crossbars at either end and secured by pegs. The ends of the crossbars project beyond the slats. This frame is supported by bars from the walls of the hut and from it the pot (No. 168943) hangs over the lamp. Length, 16} inches; width, 13$ inches. Eskimo, East Greenland. Collected by Capt. Gustav Holm. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 168941. Plate 8, fig. 3.

RouND COOKING POT. Small pot cut from soapstone. Holes are bored through the edge for suspension. This is probably one of the small objects found in graves in South Greenland. Diameter, 23 inches; height, 1} inches. Eskimo, South Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45848. Plate 9, fig. 2.
CookING POT. Of soapstone; the walls thin and strongly bulged at the sides, the ends only slightly so. The sides slant outward in reverse of those of Ungava, Labrador. Length, 132inches; width, 8 inches; height, 4% inches. Itah Eskimo, Port Foulke, West Greenland. Collected by Dr. I. 1. Hayes. 563. Plate 9, fig. 3.
CooKkING Pot. Oblong-oval pot cut from soapstone. At the four corners beckets have been cut out in the edge of the pot; these are pierced for passage of the suspending cords. This pot belongs with lamp No. 45846, plate 7, fig.2. Length, 814 inches; width, 64 inches; height, 3 inches. Eskimo, Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45850. Plate 9, fig. 4.
Cooki1nG por. Boat-shaped pot cut out of soapstone with iron tools. There is a small, flat, elliptic area on the bottom upon which the pot rests. There are no holes on the edge for suspension, the interior of the vessel is rough, and though called a ‘‘cooking vessel” there is no evidence of such use. It is also of unusual shape and manifestly is not intended for use with the lamp. Probably the vessel is intended to set on an open fire. Length, 11? inches; width, 7 inches; height, 33 inches. Eskimo, Greenland. From the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities, Copenhagen. 45851.
CooKkING PoT. Small oblong vessel cut from soapstone to represent the cooking pot. Buried with the dead. Length, 24 inches; width 1,5 inches; height } inch.

The two lamps in the United States National Museum from the Maekenzie River were collected many years ago by Robert MacFarlane. They are small and have a divided bridge, relating them to the lamps ot St. Lawrence Island and eastern Siberia. No information whatever is available relating to the use of the lamp by the Mackenzie River Eskimo.
WINTER TRAVELING LAMP. Of soapstone, crescentic in shape, bottom nearly flat, sides vertical. The reservoir is shallow and is divided into two portions by a bridge. The bridge is divided into two portions by a canal cut across the middle, and the wall of the reservoir is continued around the ends, forming a narrow canal at the end of the bridge. The wick edge is slightly curved, as is the rule in all Eskimo lamps. This small lamp, which is called ‘‘a winter traveling lamp,” is useful only for giving a temporary light, and was probably carried in the interest of the smokers. Length, 5 inches; width, 24 inches; height at front, $inch; at back,?inch. Eskimo, Mackenzie River, Canada. Collected by R. MacFarlane. 2071. Plate 10, fig. 1.
SMALL LAMP. Of clay slate carved with a knife; semilunar in shape; bottom flat, edges rounded. ‘The reservoir is plain, slanting slightly from the wick edge to the rear wall. This is a model of a ‘‘ winter traveling lamp” used on a journey

<<<Page: 1476>>>

carried on the person by travelers. Small as the lamp is it seems to show traces which indicate that it has been burned. Length, 34 inches; width, 1% inches. Eskimo, Mackenzie River, Canada. Collected by R. MacFarlane. 1109. Plate 10, fig. 2.
The lamps from Point Barrow in the United States National Museum have been ably described by Mr. John Murdoch! in his paper on the ‘‘ Ray Collection.” It is only necessary, therefore, to point out the relation of the Point Barrow type lamp to those of Smith Sound. The cooking pot is also like that of the same locality in Greenland.
No drying frames were procured from Point Barrow or are mentioned in Mr. Murdoch’s paper. It is quite likely that the drying frame exists at Point Barrow. In fact, Captain Herendeen assures the writer that they are used there.
There is a lamp of pottery in the Nathan Joseph collection, Golden Gate Park Museum, San Francisco, from Alaska, which from its form appertains to Point Barrow, where pottery was formerly made.
Lamp. This lamp is elliptic in outline and is very well worked from soapstone. The reservoir is deep, and at the rear is a semilunar terrace standing threefourths inch above the floor with slanting side. The rear wall of the reservoir is nearly vertical, while the wick side slopes down to the floor of the lamp. The bottom of the lamp is flat and the sides incline inward. The wick line has a curve of about 2 feet radius. The lamp has been broken and mended with sinew and cement. ‘The resemblance of this lamp to those of Greenland (Bessels) is striking. The terrace may, however, correspond to the cavity in a similar position in the Cumberland Gulf lamp (see Plate 11, fig. 2) and for a similar use, the placing of unmelted blubber. Length, 17 inches; width, 8 inches; height, 24 inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. PJ; Ray, U.S. A. 89879.) Plate 14, neo.
Lamp. Large semilunar lamp of siliceous sandstone. It is roughly worked out, but is quite a feat to do so well with this material. The cavity is rather deep, and its floor is high at the back and slopes to the middle line, where it meets the slope from the wick edge. The latter is straight. The bottom and corners rounded. The lamp slopes toward the wick edge, asthe section shows. Length, 12} inches; width, 8 inches; height in front, 23 inches; at back, 3 inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 89880.
Lamp. Shallow, rude semilunar lamp of siliceous rock of small size. It was probably worked from a slab of stone, and must be tipped forward when in use. The reservoir is shallow and bowed—that is, formed by two slanting planes which meet at a middle line corresponding to the terrace in the rear of the type lamp. This lamp is a rude approximation to the better formed lamps of soapstone. It has, however, seen service. Length, 8} inches; width, 44 inches; height, 18 inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 89881.
TRAVEILINGLAMP. Smalllamp of soapstone of somewhatirregular semilunar outline, owing to the shape of the original piece of stone. The reservoir is shallow and flat, the wick edge slanting down to the bottom. The wick edge is convex in outline. The lamp must be tipped forward to supply oil to the wick. This is one of the small lamps for special use. Length, 84 inches; width, 44 inches; height, Linch. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 56673. Plate 11, fig. 2.

Lamp. Rude lamp of soapstone, which owes its irregular shape to the original piece of stone from which it was excavated. Length, 64 inches; width, 34 inches; height, 14 inches. Eskimo, Point Barrow, Alaska. Collected by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 89882. Plate 11, fig. 3.
The description of the lamps from Kotzebue Sound must be based upon two small specimens in the United States National Museum. These lamps have the shape of a clam shell, having the length and width nearly equal, exactly so in one specimen. A lamp from the Nathan Joseph collection in the Golden Gate Park Museum in San Francisco is of this type, and is undoubtedly from the Kotzebue region. (See plate 12, fig. 3.) The length is 103 inches and the width, 94 inches. The material is clay slate.’ One of the lamps in the Field Columbian Museum is made of wood.’
TRAVELING LAMP. Of soapstone; ovate triangular in outline, all corners being rounded for comfort in carrying. Bottom and floor of reservoir flat. Lamp does not incline. Walls of side slanting to reservoir floor. Wick edge bowed more than usual. Length, 6} inches; width, 5 inches; height, 12 inches. Hotham Inlet, Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 64223. Plate 12, safes ale
Lamp. Small model in soapstone of the typical semilunar shape of the Eskimo lamp from Greenland to Norton Bay. Length, 12 inches; width, 2} inches; height, 4+ inch. Eskimo, Cape Darby, Norton Bay, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 48138. Plate 12, fig. 2.
The lamps from the northern shore of Norton Sound are of the Kotzebue type, flat and with the outline of the clam shell.
The lamp from St. Michaels on the south shore seems to anticipate the sadiron lamp of the Alaskan Peninsula. It must be borne in mind that St. Michaels is the great emporium of this region, and specimens drift in there from many different localities.
Lamp. Shallow lamp of sandstone of the shape of the small lamp 44338, well made and evidently having seen long service. The wick edge is nearly straight; the corners rounded by use. This lampis the Kotzebue type, which is extremely simple. Length of wick edge, 8 inches; width, 6} inches; heighth, 1{ inches. Eskimo, Norton Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 49110. Plate 13, fig. 1.
SMALL LAMP. Smallsemilunar lamp, excavated from soapstone, with slanting walls and slightly curved bottom. The lamp is very shallow and the wick edge straight. It was probably used by hunters or travelers in the summer. Length, 34 inches; width, 4% inches; height, } inch. Eskimo, Norton Sound, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 44338. Plate 13, fig. 2.
' Outlines and sections of all the lamps in the San Francisco Museum were furnished through the kindness of the curator, Charles P. Wileomb.
2Several Kotzebue lamps are in the Field Columbian Museum at Chicago. One of these, a small oval lamp with divided bridge is interesting in relation to the distribution of this feature. Through the kindness of Dr. George A. Dorsey a photograph of these lamps was secured which unfortunately came too late for insertion in this work,

<<<Page: 1498>>>

Stoneé LAMP. Worked from tufaceous rock; very much disintegrated. Shape that of a sadiron; bottom flat, rounding toward vertical sides. The reservoir is oval and shallow; the sides rise to uniform height all around it. The point where the wick has been laid is not specially worked for the purpose. This lamp bears no resemblance to those collected by EX. W. Nelson in Norton Sound. In general appearance it more nearly resembles some varieties of the Kodiak lamp, and the narrow lip increases the resemblance. There are two lamps in the United States National Museum from the peninsula lying between Norton and Kotzebue sounds for comparison, which show that its affiliations are with those of Kodiak and the Alaskan Peninsula. Length, 112 inches; greatest width, 64 inches; height, 2 inches. Eskimo, St. Michaels, Norton Sound, Alaska. Collected by L. M. Turner. 30761. Plate 13, fig. 3.
SMALL LAMP. Formed of concretion of gray, shaly rock, of natural shape, not worked in any way. It is oval in shape and on one side there is evidence of the charring of the wick. This lamp was probably carried by hunters. Length, 34 inches; width, 24 inches; height, } inch. Eskimo, St. Michaels, Norton Sound, Alaska. Collected by E.W.Nelson. 43470. Plate 13, fig. 4.
These lamps are of pottery, skillfully made and baked. The lamps with two wick edges are unique, and altogether the utensil in this locality and has assumed several curious forms. The bridged lamp of North Greenland is here repeated, but with various modifications, and are connected with Asia by the Siberian example. (See plate 17.)
The pottery lamp rests and drip catchers are unique. One of the rests in the collection is a whale’s vertebra, with the spinous processes hacked off. ;
The drying frame does not exist. Its place is taken by pegs driven in the earth walls of the house.
The shape of the St. Lawrence Island lamp seems to have followed that of the wooden platters.
EARTHENWARE LAMP. Made of clay, mixed with angular rock fragments, strong and well burnt. In shape it is the most divergent lamp in the collection. Viewed from above its outline is oblate, having a square projection from one side separated from the main reservoir by a low ridge. This lamp inclines slightly toward the wick edge. The wick edge curves gently, while in front of it is a low bridge with ends slanting down to the floor of the lamp, allowing a narrow space for the oil to flow around to the wick. The purpose of the rear projection and cavity is conjectural. It would seem very convenient for grasping the lighted lamp if it were desired to carry it. This lamp could be carried lighted, as the bridge would prevent the wash of the oil against the wick. This may be one of the functions of the bridge. This lamp is supplied with a wooden dish in which it rests. Width, 52 inches; length, 6} inches; height at rear, 1,3; inches; at front, 12 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E.W.Nelson. 63543. Plate 14, figs. 1, 2, and 3.
Lamp. Pottery lamp, oblong, with rounded corners. Slanting bridges on either side springing from angle formed by side and floor. These bridges are divided by a central cleft into two equal portions. Length, 11 inches; width, 9} inches; height, 24 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63570. Plate 15, fig, 1.

DOUBLE LAMP. Made of clay with large admixture of quartz fragments, strongly burnt and completely soaked with oil. In shape it is a large oblong platter having concave side with a step at either end above the bottom of the reservoir. At either side the step is raised into crescentic ridges, each pierced with two holes slanting down to the reservoir with the angle of the sides. Through these orifices the wick is fed. The wick is laid along the edge of either side of the lamp. This is the only example of a double Eskimo lamp, and from its capacity it must have been used where oil was plenty. The lamp bears a likeness to the wooden dishes of this region. Length, 15} inches; width, 12} inches; height, 2? inches Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Bering Strait, Alaska.
Collected by E. W. Nelson. 49196. Plate 15, fig. 3.
Lamp. This lamp is made of clay burning yellow, with coarse temper of subangular quartz fragments. It is oblong, with truncated corners resembling in shape the wooden dishes of the Norton Sound region, and israther deep. The clay was probably formed in a wooden dish. The upper edge is flat, except on the side where the wick is placed, which is rounded off. At 2 inches from the lip and parallel with it there is a bridge 44 inches long, standing 12 inches above the bottom of the lamp at the rear and five-eighths of an inch in relief in front of the lip, thus forming a shelf. The office of the bridge may he to prevent particles of moss falling into the oil, to prevent floating masses of unmelted blubber from interfering with the wick, or it may be used as a secondary wick surface when the oil is low. The deposits on the ridge seems to point to the latter use. By the flattening of the base the lamp leans forward toward the wick edge at a low angle, as is observed in the Chukchis lamp (Plate 17, fig. 1) and in common with the latter it possesses a ridge. This Jamp is set on a vessel which combines the functions of rest and drip catcher. Length, 8+ inches; width, 6} inches; height, at rear, 24 inches; at front, 2 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63544. Plate 15, fig. 4.
OBLONG COOKING Pot. Made of coarse earthernware. At the upper corners the clay has been pinched up and pierced for the attachment of cords for suspending the pot. The vessel is rudely made and is much blackened with lamp smoke. Length, 6 inches; width, 4% inches; height, 2} inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63546. Plate 16, fig. 1.
OBLONG COOKING POT. Small oblong pot of coarse pottery, blackened and covered on the bottom with deposit from the lamp. Each corner is pierced with two orifices through which pass whalebone strips for suspending the pot. The vessel would seem too small for cooking food, but it has evidently been used over the lamp. Length, 48 inches; width, 34 inches; height, 1{ inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63548. Plate 16, fig. 2.
OBLONG COOKING Por. Small oblong pot of very coarse earthenware, without lugs; probably a food vessel, as it is not smoked by the lamp. Length, 42 inches; width, 32 inches; height, 12 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63547. Plate 16, fig. 3.
Drip CATCHER. Long, narrow, shallow vessel of coarse burnt clay, rounded at the ends and slightly curved. This vessel is catalogued as a lamp. Its edges are not found for the wick, which is an infallible test fora lamp. It was probably placed under the lip of a lamp to catch dropping oil. Length, 8}inches; width, 27 inches; height 12 inches. Eskimo, St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 63545. Plate 16, fig. 4.

A full account of the Chukchis lamps of eastern Siberia is given by. Baron Nordenskiold in his “ Voyage of the Vega.” The method of installation is shown on plate 17, fig. 2, taken from that work.
The connection with Asia is one of a number which have been noticed recently.
Lamp. Excavated from soapstone, apparently with stone tools. The original surface of the stone shows in one place on the exterior. [t is roughly hemispherical. When resting on the rounded and insecure base the rim of the lamp slants at an angle of about 37 degrees, the walls of the cavity being high at the rear, running down and merging into the wick edge. The floor rises from the middle toward the back and front. The bridge is divided into two equal sections by a V-shaped cut in the middle, the oil thus flowing to the wick through three channels. The wick edge is slightly curving and wider than the back of the lamp. Width, 6} inches at wick edge; length to rear, 6 inches; height at rear, 42 inches; front, 14 inches. Chukchis, eastern Siberia. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 64222. Plate 17, fig. 1.
South of Norton Sound the lamp becomes a shallow saucer of baked clay, rarely of stone, without wick edge, so that in absence of knowledge of their use they never would be classed as lamps. As has been mentioned, they are affiliated with Asiatic saucer lamps.
The number of specimens in the United States National Museum from the north shore of Bristol Bay has given this type its name. Perhaps a more descriptive name would be lamp of the Yukon-Kuskokwim tundra. ;
These lamps are set up on a stake, having the top hollowed out to receive the bulging bottom of the lamp. The wick is laid along a small space on the edge, following the Kadiak method. It is not known whether this lamp is ever furnished with a single solid wick or burned with a floating wick. The former supposition seems to be borne out by the model from Nushagak (fig. 1).
The cooking pot of this region is circular, and designed for placing on an open fire, as driftwood is plentiful.
In the southern portion of this region an admixture of forms takes place. The lamps are of stone, circular, but in nearly every case have the wick edge worked out. A similar mixture of form occurs between Kadiak, the Alaskan Peninsula, and Aleutian Chain. Four of these lamps are shown on plate 20.
Lamp. This is the smallest lamp among the series of pottery lamps in the United States National Museum. It apparently has been little used, probably for some special purpose or asa toy. Eskimo, Cape Vancouver, Alaska. Collected by J. H. Turner. 153703. Plate 18, fig. 1.

Lamp. Old pottery lamp of the ordinary Bristol Bay type. The edge shows marks of charring and the lamp is soaked with oil. Diameter, 7} inches; height, 2: inches. Eskimo, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by C. L. MeKay. 56020a. Plate 18, fig. 3.
Lamp. Saucer-shaped lamp of pottery, soaked with oil. Thislamp is plain. There is a very shallow depression on the interior just below the edge, which defines the rim. Diameter, 5} inches; height, 1? inches. Eskimo, Ugashik, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by J. W. Johnson. 127660b. Plate 18, fig. 4.
Lamp. Saucer shaped lamp of pottery, neatly made, soaked with oil. The walls are decorated with horizontal parallel shallow grooves scratched in the paste. The exterior of the beveled rim is decorated in the same way. In the center of the vessel is an outlined circle, from which radiate at right angles four arms, formed of grooves scratched in the paste, which Mr. Nelson informs the writer is a personal mark. Diameter, 42 inches; height, 14 inches. Eskimo, Big Lake, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson. 38077. Plate 19, fig. 1.
Lamp. Of pottery, soaked with oil; saucer-shaped. In the bottom is a square cross in a circular field bounded by the lowest of the four grooves around the side. The outside of the rim has three grooves; the bottom is quite smooth and even in outline. Traces of moss are found in the grooves. The function of the grooves, if they are more than decorative, is not known. The lamp may have been burned by means of a piece of moss placed in the center or floating in the oil, like those of the Novaks.' Diameter, 32 inches; height, 14 inches. Eskimo of Lower Yukon, Alaska. Collected by E. W. Nelson, 38078. Plate 19, fig. 2.
Lamp. Pottery lamp with horizontal grooves around the inside of the walls and with beveled edge. The lamp is well-shaped and is shallower than 56022. It is incrusted with grease. Diameter, 8} inches; height, 2? inches. Eskimo, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by C. L. McKay. 56021. Plate 19, fig. 3.
Lamp. Heavy, clumsily made, saucer-shaped, dish of unbaked clay without temper. The object has never been used. Diameter, 5 inches; height, 2inches. Eskimo, Ugashik, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by J. W. Johnson. 127660a.
Lamp. Evenly-shaped bowl lamp of pottery, with numerous horizontal ridges on the inside. Along a portion of the rim there is a charred crust, as though the lamp had been tilted and burned with a moss wick as in other lamps. The base is somewhat flattened. Diameter, 7 inches; height, 3} inches. Eskimo, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by C.L.McKay. 56022.
Lamp. Made of fine homogeneous clay; burned. Itis the largest circular pottery lamp in the United States National Museum. ‘The edge is beveled and grooved. The grooves inside are shallow, and in the floor of the lamp is a circle with radiating arms, forming across. From the incrustation around the edge it would seem that a moss wick was used. Diameter, 10} inches; height, 34 inches. Eskimo, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by C.L. McKay. 56020.
Lamp. Heavy saucer-shaped lamp of pottery; soaked with oil from use. This lamp is plain, and has evidently seen long service. There is no well-marked wick edge, and it is probable that the wick floated in the oil or was placed in the center. This lamp was used in the house. Diameter, 84 inches; height, 22 inches. Eskimo, Ugashik, Bristol] Bay, Alaska. Collected by J. W. Johnson. 127660c.
Lamp. This lamp is of hard crystalline rock. It has been worked apparently from a beach pebble by pecking. The lower portion is rounded without flattened portion for a base of support; the lamp, however, is stable and has a slight inclination toward the wick edge; around the side a wide groove has been worked, making a decided rim. The reseryoiris shallow and perfectly oval in outline with a flat edge, which has been worked down at one apex of the oval to form a narrow

a very fine specimen of stone working. It is like the Kadiak lamps in the lip, }
but the general appearance is that of the pottery lamps of the Bristol Bay region. Dimensions, 5$ inches by 44 inches; height, 2? inches. Eskimo, Bristol Bay, Alaska. Collected by C.L.McKay. 56024. Plate 20, fig. 3.
There is a full series of lamps ‘from Kadiak in the United States National Museum. They are of hard dioritic rock and are usually carefully worked and finished. It would be difficult to mention better specimens of stone working. Some of the lamps are very large, one in the collection weighing 67 pounds. They are oval in outline, with a
shallow reservoir, low walls with flat top, the sides are often grooved, :
the bottom convex. The wick edge is a small groove cut through the wall at the apex of the oval leading to it.
There is no information concerning the installation of these lamps, the specimens, like those of the Aleuts, having been taken from old village sites.
An oval lamp of the type exists in the collection of the Alaska Commercial Company, Golden Gate Park Museum at San Francisco, California. It is curious, having the channel for the wick deeper than the bottom of the lamp and two conical projections rising from the floor of the reservoir near the back of the lamp. The material is diorite.
Lamp. Cut out of greenish diorite; upper surface polished; bottom showing hammer marks. The lamp is of sad-iron shape, the shallow reservoir surrounded by a broad flat rim. The edge of the lamp below the rim has been rubbed into a groove. The bottom is rounded, but the lamp is stable on its base. The wick lip isnarrow. Length from front to back, 114 inches; width, 8 inches; height 4 inches. Eskimo, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by Commander L. A. Beardslee, U.S.N. 42321. Plate 21, fig. 1.
Lamp. Of hard, gray rock, originally perhaps a beach bowlder; bottom rounded, edge flat, cavity well worked out. A small lip has been cut into the edge at the apex of the oval, where there is an accumulation of charred wick. The cavity of the lamp has been employed for grinding red paint. Measurements, 6 by 8 by 34 inches. Eskimo, Karluk, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by W.J.Fisher. 74724. Plate 21, fig. 2.
Lamp. This lamp is of metamorphic or voleanic rock. It is oval in outline, the sides straight and the bottom curved. The reservoir is neatly hollowed out and polished; the wick space or lip a shallow trough cut through the edge at the apex of the oval. When placed on its base, the lamp inclines strongly toward the lip. Length, 44 inches; width, 3} inches; height in front, 14 inches; atrear,2}inches. Eskimo, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by Dr. Tarleton H. Bean. 131237. Plate 21, fig. 3.
Lamp. Small oval lamp of hard rock (basalt), with rounded sides and flat bottom, the latter showing the fractured surface. The cavity is elliptic; the lip is worked at one end and shows traces of charred moss. This lamp was taken from an ancient dwelling and is probably a convenient pocket lamp used in traveling. Length, 3 inches; width, 24 inches; height, 1 inch. Eskimo, St. Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by W. J. Fisher. 90483, Plate 21, fig. 4.
Lamp. Lamp of greenish-gray rock, finely worked and polished. It is oval in shape, broader at the back than at the front, with almost flat, shghtly rounded bottom, upon which it firmly rests. ‘The reservoir shallow, the upper edge wide and flat.

Lamp. Very finely worked from green metamorphic stone; ovate in outline, with squared edges and rounded bottom, on which the lamp accurately balances. Reservoir deep, uniformly concave; upper edge fiat; lip narrow, cut in the edge at the point of the oval. The edges and reservoir have been polished; the bottom shows marks of hammer stone in working the lamp out. This is a splendid specimen of stone working. The lamp approximates the round shape of the Yukon Delta lamps. Length, 11 inches; width, 10 inches; height, 4 inches. Eskimo of Afognak Island, Alaska. Collected by W.J. Fisher. 74726.
Lamp. Oval lamp of fine-grained hard stone, nicely worked out. The lamp is a true oval, with a wick area at the smallerapex. The side of the lamp is worked with a broad, shallow groove, and the bottom is rounded. Length, 6} inches; width, 42 inches; height, 1g inches. Eskimo, Ugashik, Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska. Collected by W. J. Fisher. 90472.
Lamp. Of hard, gray rock from the beach; original surface showing on portions of thelowerside. Sad-iron shape; upper edge slightly concave; reservoir shallow ; lip narrow. The bottom is rounded; the sides plain, nearly vertical. The lamp sits nearly horizontal—that is, the rear only ¢ inch higher than the point. Length, 93 inches; width, 74 inches; height, 22 inches. Eskimo, Afognak Island (Kadiak Group), Alaska. Collected by W. J. Fisher. 90473.
Lamp. Worked from a beach pebble of greenish-gray voleanic rock, of which the original surface shows in two places beneath. The cavity is shallow, uniformly concave, and is ovate in outline. There is no lip specially worked out for the wick, though the lamp inclines toward the apex of theoval. Itresembles the Bristol Bay type. Length, 6 inches; width, 5} inches; height, 2% inches. Eskimo, Lesnova, Kadiak Island, Alaska. Collected by W. J. Fisher. 90481. Plate 20, fig. 1.
The most primitive lamps on earth are those of the ancient Aleuts. Many of them are merely unmodified rock fragments, and by far the larger number which have been adapted show little modification. Very rarely a completely worked lamp is found. These lamps were, with few exceptions, collected by Mr. W. H. Dall from prehistoric village sites.
There is quite a number of small lamps in the collection from these islands. Mr. Dall informs the writer that the Aleuts used small lamps to take to sea in the fishing boats. As the men get chilled on these trips, the little lamps are useful to warm the hands or body. In the latter case they fill the lamp from the oil bottle, place it in the lap under the gut coat, light it, and let it burn awhile. These lamps are often put to the same use in the house when the weather is cold.
The Aleuts always built the fire outside of the house, as the climate is mild. They are also said by early explorers to have done little cooking.
Lamp. Subangular, water-worn beach stone, elliptic in shape, having a natural cavity on the upper surface forming the lamp reservoir. Crusts of charred moss still adhere to the lamp near the lip where the wick was laid, and the lamp shows evidence of long and constant usage. The specimen was taken from a
mound. Length, 9 inches; width, 6} inches. Aleuts, [liuliuk, Unalashka Island, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14894. Plate 22, fig. 1.

Lamp. Natural shell of volcanic rock, which, from its shape, has been found suitable foralamp. Length, 5} inches; width, 42 inches. Aleuts, Bay of Islands, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 138017. Plate 22, fig. 2.
Lamp. Made from voleanic breccia; nearly circular in outline. The reservoir is shallow; the front portion has been broken away. Length, 53 inches; width, 47 inches; height, 2} inches. Aleuts, Constantine Harbor, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 13020.
Lamp. Somewhat water-worn fragment of metamorphic rock, with a natural concavity and slant, which have been taken advantage of by the Aleuts for use as alamp. The stone is absolutely unmodified, but it serves the purpose as well as though designed by art. The wick edge is irregular, and it must have been possible to lay the wick along a line of about three inches. The edge shows traces of charred moss and the action of fire. This lamp is the most primitive which has come to my knowledge, and it might well begin the entire developmental series of lamps if there were not a question whether or not it is a
oda hel
makeshift. The Aleuts of the peninsula, at least, did work their lamps from —
stone with some degree of finish. Length, 94 inches; width, 6 inches; height at rear, 3 inches. Aleuts, Unalaska, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14891, Plate 22, fig. 3.
Lamp. Worked from an oval beach pebble; the reservoir is shallow and oval in outline; there is no definite lip worked out. The bottom of the lamp is irregwar; when in use, the lamp must be propped up. Length, 44 inches; width, 32 inches; height, 2 inches. Aleuts, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14896, Plate 22, fig. 4.
Lamp. Oblong beach pebble with cavity worked in it. Itis probably a toy, if ever designed for a lamp. Length, 3 inches; width, 1% inches. Aleuts, Unalaska, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 16061. Plate 22, fig. 5.
Lamp. Oval, worked from coarse volcanic breccia. The reservoir is shallow, with the bottom flat. This specimen has seen long use and the remains of charred wick indicate that the lamp was lighted around the entire edge. There is, however, a lip worked out on the edge, as in Kadiak lamps. Length, 62 inches; width, 64 inches; height at front, 2 inches; at back, 2? inches. Aleuts, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 14897. Plate 20, fig. 4.
Lamp. Oblong-oval lamp excavated in a gray volcanic beach pebble, having a tendency to split into layers. The bottom has cracked off. The reservoir is elliptic in outline and shows markedly the effect of the oil and burning. Length, 6 inches; width, 3} inches; height, 1}inches. Aleuts, Alaska. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14899. Plate 23, fig. 1.
Lamp. Small oval lamp of yellow volcanic rock, having an oval cavity worked out apparently with a sharp-edged tool. There is no defined lip, the wick being applied at the narrower point of the oval. This lamp was taken from a mound or village site. Length, 4} inches; width, 3} inches; height, 14 inches. Aleuts, Ulatka, Alaska Peninsula. Collected by W. H. Dall. 14911.
Lamp. Small oval lamp worked from a beach pebble of gray volcanic rock. The cavity has been rudely excavated and is oval in outline. Length, 4 inches; width, 3 inches; height, 1} inches. Aleuts, Alaskan Peninsula, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 14898. Plate 23, fig. 2.
Lamp. Shallow reservoir worked out in the surface of a rounded beach pebble of voleanic rock. The outline of the reservoir is oval and its surface is roughly finished. Length, 5} inches; width, 44 inches; height, 2 inches. Aleuts, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 14900. Plate 23, fig. 3.
Lamp. Made from gray volcanic rock. The reservoir is shallow and semicircular in outline, resembling the Greenland lamp. This is due to the shape of the original beach pebble. There are slight traces of burning on this lamp. Length, 5 inches; width, 3% inches; height,14 inches. Eskimo, Unalaska, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 16395. Plate 23, fig. 4.

Lamp. Oval lamp of stone, the wick lip being at the narrower point. This lamp has seen constant use, the stone having spalled off from heat. Length, 64 inches; width, 4? inches; height, 1} inches. Eskimo, Unalaska, Alaska. Collected by W.H. Dall. 16369. Plate 23, fig. 5.
Lamp. Small circular lamp smoothly worked from stone; this has a groove worked around the outside and a lip is worked in the edge; the reservoir is cup-shaped. Apparently at times the wick has been installed around the edge, probably to secure a greater light than the width of the wick edge or lip would admit. While identical in form with the lamps from Bristol Bay the lip cut in the edge relates it to the Kadiak region. Length, 4tinches; width, 44 inches; height, 2} inches. Aleuts, Oukivok Island, Alaska. Collected by United States Fish Commission. 140961. Plate 20, fig. 2.
Lamp. Suboval, with rounded bottom, vertical sides, and rounded edge. The walls of the reservoir are nearly vertical and the bottom nearly flat. A large chip has been knocked off the edge, apparently with design, in order to place a moss wick, the remains of which are found on the broken surface. This lamp seems to bea connecting type between those of Kadiak and the pottery lamps of Bristol Bay. It was taken from a burial place. Length, 4} inches; width, 42 inches; height, 2,;,inches. Aleuts, Cheranotisky, Unalaska Island, Alaska. Collected by Marcus Baker. 46203.
