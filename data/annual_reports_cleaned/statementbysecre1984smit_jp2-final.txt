The Smithsonian Institution « 1985

<<<Page: 7>>>

Frontispiece: During the past twenty years under Secretary Ripley’s guidance, the Smithsonian has been dedicated to reaching out to the public at large. At the same time, the boundaries of museum activities have been extended beyond the monumental buildings to the Mall and other spaces outside. Exemplifying this spirit, the photos on the preceding pages show (left) one of the posters at Washington bus stops that promoted a major exhibition at the Freer Gallery celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of James McNeill Whistler and (right) a nineteenth-century bandstand, a gift from the State of Illinois, which was installed in the outdoor amphitheater near the west end of the National Museum of American History during the early summer of 1984.

The Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

the great plain of the then empty Mall. It boded so well in many respects: the promise of enriching activity, like warm rain to nourish the crop of human potential. President Kennedy’s clarion call to a New Frontier still echoed noble challenges as the Peace Corps reached its stride, and the Great Society agenda was gathering force. The new National Council on the Arts was conceiving _the Arts and Humanities Endowments that would grow mightily during President Nixon’s administration. America was “busting out all over’ in 1964, not only at the Smithsonian but everywhere. It is fitting to remember that all the energy was not wisely spent; that a well-intentioned nation blundered into the Vietnam misadventure. The nation and its leaders were not faultless in that highly charged decade (or any other), but the common failings then were neither timidity nor conformity. Even around the Smithsonian—especially here, I believe—one sensed a kind of estival energy.
Perhaps one had to have been here in the dead of institutional winter to appreciate it. Again “look backward lest we fail to mark the path ahead.” Early in the Second World War, I had passed through the Museum of Natural History and found it as stifling as my wartime destination in the Southeast Asian forest. The administrator of the museum was unaffectionately known as the “Abominable No-man” for his unwavering diligence in barring the door against innovation, while the curatorial staff was preoccupied with housekeeping and the conduct of bureaucracy. Yet by 1964, a new generation of curators was emerging. Perhaps they represented a phylogenetic leap or, more likely, were boosted by the winds of productive adventure blowing across the land.
Raising our sights two decades ago, we surveyed the world of science, history, and art from the Castle and realized our discovered goals were not so much new ambitions as renewed intentions to realize the Institution’s ancient promise. We found one challenge in Secretary Henry’s aim to make the Smithsonian a center for “enlarging the bounds of human thought”; another in his boast that “we have from the first kept a keen eye on every discovery of science and every invention in art”; a third in his vision for a “College of Discoverers.” Nor could we forget the mighty mandate of the legator himself “to found in Washington an Institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
First among my aims was the basically democratic one to make the Smithsonian known to its owners, the American people and by extension all humankind. The public had come to view the Smith-

operating expenses since 1847....
Personnel problems were also linked to the dependency on federal appropriations. For reasons lost in the ossuaries of history, every Smithsonian employee was a federal worker first and a scholar, scientist, or technician second. The terms of employment did not necessarily address the career concerns of scholar or scientist. It was clear that we had to find ways to compete with universities and other research institutions, to offer not only laboratory space, but staff assistance, publishing opportunity, and higher salaries which perforce must be funded from new private endowments. As a virtual ward of the government, the Institution might eschew individual enterprise and intellectual initiative. It behooved us to encourage our people in the unfettered pursuit of professional interests.
Looking back over these twenty years is like studying a great tapestry in the Textiles Collection, a complex of many threads. In that first fiscal year the Smithsonian bravely opened several new offices to embark on overdue work in various directions. We established an Office of Education and Training, then an Office of International Activities which William W. Warner directed with peripatetic éclat. It organized the first archaeological dig abroad with State Department cooperation. It helped unesco rescue Abu Simbel and the monuments of Nubia from the rising waters of Lake Nasser. It facilitated American scientists of all disciplines and affiliations to work abroad by making local currencies available to them as “counterpart funds.” If it appeared that the Institution was embarked on an “outreach” campaign that year, the stage was being set for other drama through such activities as the first conversations with Joseph H. Hirshhorn.
Studying what had come before offered a splendid springboard, for a review of Smithson’s legacy revealed that 1965 was the bicentennial of the founder’s birth. What better occasion to win academe and public alike to our renascent cause and, mirabile dictu, rededicate his namesake Institution. The convocation celebrating James Smithson’s 200th birthday brought the pomp and panoply of a full-dress academic procession to the Mall as we conferred the first Smithson Medal on the Royal Society (of which our founder had been a member at age twenty-four). Some five hundred learned societies around the globe sent their representatives in recognition of the Smithsonian’s contributions to learning since 1846. These harkened back to the free exchange of scientific information and research under the first Secretary.

tual world about. The experience has not always “worked,” but the annual meetings serve as a fascinating inward look and outward exposure for both sides.
The following year marked the bestowal upon the Smithsonian of the Lilly Collection of rare coins. Work began on the revised multivolume Handbook of North American Indians and the Urgent Anthropology Program. The year 1967 also brought new vitality
to “people programs.” Alarmed by the consensus among authori-
ties at an Aspen conference that museums belonged to gentry, Charles Blitzer and I countered with a novel proposal: If less elegant people tacitly proved the brahmins correct by staying away from marble halls on the Mall, the Loop, and Fifth Avenue, then let us build smaller museums in lesser neighborhoods. In Washington’s inner city we found an abandoned movie theater, a willing community, and an administrator who was a local resident and knew the area and its people well. Then John R. Kinard opened the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and its doors are still open, on the avenue later named for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
The Department of Transportation was also born in 1967, and the Smithsonian took due notice. A vehicular extravaganza on the Mall (which already boasted the roundabout jitney of the carousel) featured a rally of antique cars, an exhibit of vehicles of the future, and even a demonstration of real levitation as a “test pilot’ bounded around wearing a rocket belt. But in the most splendid event on our lawns that year, the first Festival of American Folklife, under the far-seeing direction of Ralph Rinzler, our expert in ethnicity and folkcrafts, celebrated the manifold creativity of the American people.
In 1968, the Office of Museum Programs opened and, reflecting the spirit of the National Museum Act of 1966, provided an array of advisory and assistance programs to kindred institutions throughout the land. It also would serve as our conduit of news about goings on elsewhere in America and abroad. New York’s Cooper Union Museum was reborn as a Smithsonian bureau, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, significantly our only museum outside Washington, D.C.
In Washington the fabled Patent Office Building became another of the Smithsonian’s many mansions, this one to house both the National Portrait Gallery and the National Collection of Fine Arts. Here nomenclature presented conundrums fit for a taxonomist. Since 1910 the Smithsonian had a “National Gallery of Art’ of sorts, but Andrew Mellon had appropriated the generic name with

<<<Page: 16>>>

his famous gift in 1938. The Smithsonian’s art holdings then acquired the title of National Collection of Fine Arts, a rather grandiose handle for the eclectic, interesting, yet fragmentary group of objets that dustily reposed in Hall 10 of the Natural History Museum. It was this material that became the nucleus of the Patent Office’s north side, which was later renamed most descriptively the National Museum of American Art.
As for the National Portrait Gallery, this was no mere copy of a British model, but thanks to its first two directors, Charles Nagel and Marvin Sadik, a uniquely original museum: a source of visual information about famous Americans.
In 1968, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was chartered by Congress as a Smithsonian bureau (under an independent board of trustees, like the Kennedy Center and the National Gallery of Art). In the same year the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, a joint venture with Harvard University, opened its largest field facility, later named the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, atop Mount Hopkins in Arizona. As the decade drew to a close, we looked farther and farther ahead. Ground was broken for the Hirshhorn Museum, and plans were laid for a national magazine to report on everything that interested the Smithsonian “or should interest it,” as founding editor Edward K. Thompson put it.
As the new decade began, we received approval to build the National Air and Space Museum by a stroke of fiduciary genius that might stand every government agency in good stead today. Congress had authorized the expenditure of some $40 million for the new museum, and we had commissioned a fine design. But with costs skyrocketing, the construction bids were coming in at $65 million and up. Representative Michael Kirwan, a former Regent and faithful friend on Capitol Hill, warned of disaster if we requested more money. Instead, we informed our architect, Gyo Obata, of our dilemma, told him that there was no alternative to a streamlined, stripped-down design. At the same time, we persuaded a new President, Mr. Nixon, the Budget Office, and Congress that if there was to be a National Air and Space Museum in Washington on July 4, 1976, we must act quickly and push our design and budget through. For this we summoned a blue ribbon team: two Regents, William Burden and James Webb, and the charismatic figure of Michael Collins fresh from the first moon voyage. This astronaut pleaded our cause as the Director-elect of the world’s most popular museum of the future. Meanwhile, the

Natural History Museum purchased a device of then novel design and priceless worth for its investigations of previously unperceivable minutiae, our first scanning electron microscope. The Institution also abetted the exploration of ephemera by supporting a new branch in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena.
The troubled 1970s saw new and diverse activity on and around the Mall. For one thing, the Kennedy Center opened. For another, citizens returned en masse to Washington to protest the tragic war in Vietnam. Here we were able to serve in a manner unexpected for repositories of fossils and art. When tear gas lacrimated the city, more than 80,000 people found fresh air in the environmentally contained Museum of History and Technology.
In another sort of departure from inhumane policies, we annulled the rule requiring our researchers to present their papers for prepublication review. And under the aegis of Charles Blitzer and David Challinor, the tasks of heading scholarly and scientific departments were put on a rotating basis—no more permanent chairmen—in hope of precluding the investiture of a bureaucratic satrapy.
In 1970, the Archives of American Art, an invaluable repository of the personal history and maturation of America’s artists, became a Smithsonian bureau. Also, hospitality services for the Institution were expanded through the Visitors Information and Associates’ Reception Center, which now directs a corps of volunteers approximately as large as the Smithsonian’s staff. V1arc opened in conjunction with the premiere issue of Smithsonian magazine, whose subscribers were automatically National Associates. The magazine won Regents’ approval just after Earl Warren stepped down as Chief Justice and ex officio Chancellor of the Institution. Although many members of the Smithsonian community opposed our entering the hue-and-cry world of popular journalism (as a few diehards still do), and grumblings about media grants were growing louder in many quarters, our newly appointed Chancellor, Chief Justice Warren Burger, led the Regents in approving the magazine. Within two years, the magazine began showing a profit and has added handsomely to trust fund accounts over the years. It has also won kudos from both media experts and the public, who now subscribe as Associates in numbers exceeding two million.
In July 1970, the Smithsonian was privileged to enter the limelight on Capitol Hill when Representative Frank Thompson chaired

<<<Page: 19>>>

a committee that reviewed our operations, policies, and finances. While some bureau directors anticipated the hearings with dread, I welcomed this expression of congressional interest in the Smithsonian, the first since 1855. We were fortunate that these overseers corrected an ill-advised plan: the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden would not transect the Mall. Beyond that, the committee concluded that “the Smithsonian’s value is basic and should be continued. Its work and research in science, education, history and the arts and, of course, its many museums far overshadow whatever criticisms . . . have been made.” Further afield, the Fort Pierce Bureau in Link Port, Florida, began operations as a Smithsonian marine station.
In 1972, President Nixon returned from his historic visit to the world’s most populous nation with a gift of two giant pandas from the people of China. They were ensconced at the National Zoo, which also prepared to embark on director Theodore H. Reed’s masterful master plan. The Renwick Gallery opened at last, and at Treasury Secretary John B. Connally’s invitation, the Group of Ten international finance ministers convened in the Castle. (It is alleged that during that meeting the dollar floated as a result of two of the finance ministers’ getting stuck together in a balky elevator.)
The following year, the Regents approved the introduction in Congress of legislation authorizing planning for a Museum Support Center on federally owned land in Silver Hill, Maryland. Having outgrown our buildings on the Mall and elsewhere, the several museums could now responsibly plan for the curation, preservation, and storage of priceless collections in what would be a state-of-the-art facility. But as we focused on new beginnings, two of the three former Secretaries died in 1973, and thus ended an actuarial miracle: until the demise of Leonard Carmichael and of Charles Greely Abbot, half of the eight men who had chaired this Institution since 1846 were still alive. (The first four died in office.)
In the Mall’s landmark event for 1974, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden opened at last, and to lasting acclaim as a repository of modern art. The following year the General Services Administration conferred on us an erstwhile experimental farm and army remount station in Front Royal, Virginia, which the Zoo put to use as a center for breeding, research, and conservation of rare animals. But 1975 was almost as notable for what did not occur. In three signal instances the Smithsonian proved that it no

We declined acquisitionof the San Francisco Mint, of the Saint Louis Post Office, and of _ the liner SS United States. We have also raised a few eyebrows by _ turning down Howard Hughes’s plane, the Spruce Goose. _ The nation’s Bicentennial witnessed celebrations almost everywhere, but the year 1976 was an especial one on the Mall where our museums mounted twenty-three special exhibitions, a grand pastiche collectively called “The American Experience.” At the suggestion of Frank Taylor, director general of the U.S. National Museum, this included the reopening of the Arts and Industries Building with a recreation of the 1876 Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia. In the Natural History Building the West Court had been developed to house a cafeteria, gift shop, and Naturalist Center. In New York, the refurbished and reorganized CooperHewitt Museum under the consummate direction of Lisa Taylor opened in Andrew Carnegie’s mansion on Fifth Avenue. But the signal premiere was on the Mall’s south side: the July first opening of the National Air and Space Museum, which set some kind of record by welcoming two million visitors in the first forty-nine days.
In the following years, the Smithsonian Institution Press added a new imprint, now known as Smithsonian Books, another publishing venture of merit for the public and revenue for the Institution. The Regents opened a special fund for Institution acquisitions, special research, and education. The Office of Biological Conservation became our coordinator and watchdog in the crucial realm of conservation activities. The Assistant Secretary for Public Service, Julian Euell, established the Office of Telecommunications under the able direction of Chic Cherkezian, thereby adding to the Institution’s outreach efforts the powerful aid of electronic media.
The decade’s last year saw several major new projects. For one, the fifteen-year-old independent Museum of African Art, so far as we know the only American museum of its ken, became a new Smithsonian bureau. In the Southwest, the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint venture with the University of Arizona at Mount Hopkins, began scanning the skies with uniquely new acuity. In the Canal Zone, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute established a 13,000-acre biological preserve, the Barro Colorado Nature Monument. At home, the Regents established a new fellowship program for attracting eminent scholars and scientists in

sonian itself, this building may never be finished save in a physical sense. Its purpose, its inner life as manifested in scholarly programs and public appreciation of exhibits, will depend on those who follow me and my generation of curators, scientists, historians, and delineators of knowledge.
The new Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures rises steadily (as I write) in its vast pit, looking in embryo like the beginnings of a coral reef in a tropical lagoon. The shelflike ledges appear in place and will superimpose themselves layer by layer. A delicate miniature forest of lacy pillars spreads up from the base like the skeletal frame of sea fans or the bare branches of gorgonians thrusting toward the light.
Soon this solid foundation will all be filled in and a verdant green carpet will spread out like the top of the reef at low tide. Look for water splashing here and there, with two projecting galleries above, beautiful stranded granite boulders rich in color, set amongst the vegetation, a dream come true.
Perhaps in years to come a similar Center for the New World can arise in the quadrilateral space east of the Air and Space Museum which was deeded to us some time ago by the Congress. The statute specified that plans for any structure on that last Mall building site must be approved in advance by Congress. (No one need be taken unawares by some vast teeth of Cadmus springing up overnight to obstruct the western vista from the Capitol towards the panorama of Mall and monuments.) This was a wise decision, one in which the Smithsonian concurred, testifying that we had no wish to encumber space with sheer manmade mass to obliterate openness, an increasingly precious commodity in our city.
If the Quadrangle becomes the success we anticipate—novel in theme as well as structure—what a fine example it can serve for the future in our world. It will serve as a model for still another vast cultural history to be told and pondered: the sweep of two continents from the Bering Sea to Cape Horn trodden by the streams of emerging civilizations over the course of some 30,000 years. Cultures have emerged in the flowing over these new worlds, from north to south, from west to east. No similar event can quite so clearly be defined on the rest of the planet; no effort has so far been attempted to describe in time and sequence this all-encompassing tidal flow which continues even today in a way whose history is only becoming known and whose future like the winds of time cannot be discerned.
For the present our new Center for African, Middle Eastern, and

as of now is for oneself alone in every sense or sensibility. Mammon is worshiped, a companion to envy and greed in the denial of faith.
In this paroxysm of shock, there is a parallel settling down as of an outward buffer towards a numbing new conservatism, a search for conformity, the building of an overweening consensus. If there is in truth only a consensus, then bureaucracy administered by computer will be the answer to everything. There will be a mood of pseudocomplacency covering an essential malaise of the spirit in what may be observed. If possible, let it be routed out if we are to succeed in the restoration of our real faith. The current state is a presentiment of a failure in our culture. We must assume that the ideals embodied in our history are capable of a just and noble restoration, and perhaps this Institution is the one to be the bellwether. Let us then summon those strange winds to our cause and make the view of the Mall one of hope, of keening winds blowing our flags straight and whipping shrill.
The Secretary’s Executive Committee was diminished by the loss of three members in the last year. Paul Perrot, Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs since 1972, became director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Chris Hohenlohe, my erstwhile executive assistant and, since 1979, the Institution’s valued Treasurer, left in November to pursue private financial enterprises. (Ann Leven, formerly of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Chase Manhattan Bank, now serves as Chris’s successor.) Regrettably, Larry Taylor, Coordinator of Public Information, retired.
Al Lerner has retired as founding director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. He has been succeeded by James Demetrion, who came from the Des Moines Art Center. Other new Smithsonian executives include Conservation Analytical Laboratory director Lambertus van Zelst; Milo C. Beach, formerly of Williams College, who will head the Sackler Gallery; and William Moss, who left the John F. Kennedy Library to direct the Smithsonian Archives.
Within the Institution, Michael Robinson moved from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute to succeed Ted Reed as director of the National Zoological Park. Bill Klein, former director of the Radiation Biology Laboratory, became director of the Environ-

room in his honor, approved in principle the expansion plans for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, endorsed the preliminary planning for a Smithsonian presence at the 1984 Edinburgh Festival, authorized the Secretary to enter into agreements with the State of Maryland to designate the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center as a National Estuarine Sanctuary, and requested that the congressional members of the Board of Regents introduce and support legislation authorizing the nonreimbursable transfer of the General Post Office building (along with appropriations for its repair and renovation) and other legislation to authorize planning and construction of science facilities for the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and the Whipple Observatory. They also voted to appoint Messrs. Michael Sonnenreich, John Al Friede, and Gustave Schindler and Mrs. Milton F. Rosenthal to terms on the Commission of the National Museum of African Art.
After Secretary Ripley discussed a variety of status reports, the chairman of the Regents Search Committee, Dr. Bowen, described the process of searching for Mr. Ripley’s successor, adding that in all of this committee’s discussions and voluminous correspondence a recurring theme was an appreciation of the Secretary for his exceptional leadership of the Smithsonian over two decades. In executive session Dr. Bowen presented the Search Committee’s recommendation and the Regents elected Robert McCormick Adams, Provost of the University of Chicago, as the ninth Secretary. Following the meeting, Messrs. Bowen, Ripley, and Adams met briefly with the heads of Smithsonian bureaus and offices in the Great Hall and then, along with Mr. Humelsine, held a press conference in the Under Secretary’s office.
The Regents’ Dinner was held on the preceding evening, January 22, in the National Museum of American History. After dinner Mr. Ripley greeted the guests and awarded to Paul N. Perrot, Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, the Secretary’s Gold Medal for Exceptional Service.
The Chancellor called to order the second meeting of the year in the Regents’ Room at 9:30 a.m., May 7, 1984. The Executive Committee reported on its meeting of April 11 in which this committee, acting on behalf of the Regents, requested the congressional Regents to promote legislation effecting the reappointment of Regents Armstrong and Higginbotham for the statutory terms of six years. The Audit and Review Committee discussed its meet-

ing of March 8 in which they had an overview of the Archives of American Art, discussed Coopers & Lybrand’s consolidated audit of trust and federal funds for fiscal year 1983 and Report to Management, considered factors in the Institution’s construction priorities, and received reports on the Office of Audits’ most significant recommendations in 1983 and on improvements in Smithsonian security programs. The Investment Policy Committee reported on its review of the investment managers’ performance and the Regents, acting on this committee’s recommendations, approved fiscal year 1985 total return payout rates for the endowment funds.
Mr. Jameson presented a detailed report on the status of current year funds and the processes of budgeting for fiscal years 1985 and 1986. After considerable discussion, the Regents voted to authorize the Secretary to negotiate contracts for the financing, construction, and operation of a new restaurant facility in the National Air and Space Museum and for the financing, appropriate renovations, and operation of food services in other Smithsonian museums; to create a Special Exhibition Fund for underwriting carefully selected, major, temporary exhibitions; to receive the Annual Report, Smithsonian Year 1983; to appoint Barbara Tuchman, Frank Stanton, and Robert McNeil to terms on the Commission of the National Portrait Gallery, to appoint Helen Neufeld and Colbert King to terms on the Commission of the National Museum of African Art, and to appoint Donald Anderson, Walter Hancock, Bartlett H. Hayes, Jr., Eloise Spaeth, Charles Parkhurst, Gene B. Davis, and Margaret Dodge Garrett to terms on the Commission of the National Museum of American Art; and to endorse the Smithsonian’s participation in the 1984 Edinburgh Festival and authorize the Secretary to draw upon unrestricted trust funds for that purpose with the approval of the Executive Committee.
Mr. Ripley reported on progress in the construction of the Quadrangle, noted that prospects were excellent for meeting or exceeding the original goal of raising $37.5 million in nonappropriated funds, and described the closing stages of the fundraising campaign. He also presented a number of status reports on Smithsonian programs and activities.
On September 24, 1983, the National Board of Smithsonian Associates unanimously recommended that two distinguished benefactors of the Institution, Dr. Arthur M. Sackler and Mrs. Enid A.

Smithsonian Institution « 1984 FINANCIAL REPORT
Summary: Fiscal year 1984 marked a year of change at the Smithsonian, most notably the appointment of Robert McC. Adams as the ninth Secretary of the Institution and the retirement of S. Dillon Ripley as the eighth Secretary. Mr. Ripley’s extraordinary legacy is nowhere more visible than in the Institution’s fiscal report. In fiscal year 1965, Mr. Ripley’s first full year as Secretary, the Institution’s operating budget was $30 million. For the year just ended, Mr. Ripley presided over a greatly expanded Institution with a budget tenfold that of fiscal year 1965.
Mr. Ripley’s twenty-year tenure, as referenced elsewhere in Smithsonian Year, brought new vitality to the Institution, vitality that cannot be measured in dollars. Mr. Ripley acted to shape the form and focus of the Institution. New museums were added, particularly in the arts. Under Dillon Ripley’s aegis, the CooperHewitt Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Renwick Gallery, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and the National Museum of African Art joined the Smithsonian family. The National Museum of American Art and the Portrait Gallery found new homes in the Old Patent Office Building, lovingly restored under Mr. Ripley’s guidance. The National Air and Space Museum opened its new building in July 1976. In 1983 construction began on the Quadrangle, Mr. Ripley’s last and most expansive project on the Mall.
Public accessibility to American culture and diversity was further enhanced by a variety of outreach activities, most notably Smithsonian magazine, which stands as the preeminent publica-

After deducting expenses of the nonappropriated auxiliary and
_ bureau activities, net operating income increased by $18 million
over the prior year to $206,452,000. Federal funds accounted for 76 percent of net revenue, nonappropriated funds contributed 17 percent, a slight increase over fiscal year 1983, with the 7 percent balance from federal grants and contracts. The application of funds
‘by all Smithsonian bureaus is outlined in Table 2, with further supporting detail in other tables.
Federal appropriations provide the core support for the Institution’s continuing programs in research, exhibitions, education, publishing, and collections management, including related administrative and support services. They provide, as well, for the maintenance and protection of the collections and physical plant.
Federal support for the Institution’s operating programs totaled $156,683,000 in fiscal year 1984, an increase of $9.4 million over fiscal year 1983. Although the majority of this increase—some $5.4 million—was required to cover inflationary increases in salaries and other expenses, significant new funding of $4 million was provided for a variety of program activities. Of this increase, $1.2 million was received for operations and program requirements at the Museum Support Center, which in fiscal year 1984 completed its first full year of operation, and for strengthening the conservation activity at the center. Complementing the growth in construction support for major renovations and repairs (discussed below), funding was received in the operating account for professional architectural and engineering services and for facilities maintenance at two off-mall facilities—the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the National Zoological Park. Other significant increases were provided for expansion of the Institution’s computing capabilities, for enhancing the security of buildings and collections, and for replacing and upgrading scientific research equipment at the Astrophysical Observatory and the Tropical Research Institute.
Support from federal agencies in the form of grants and contracts totaled $14,878,000 in fiscal year 1984, an increase of 13 percent over the previous year. These funds constitute an important source of research support for the Institution while also benefiting the granting agencies by providing access to Smithsonian expertise and

resources. As in prior years, the Smithsonian worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). As reflected in Table 3, expenditures under Nasa grants and contracts totaled approximately $11.3 million in fiscal year 1984, primarily for research programs at the Astrophysical Observatory. Sponsored research included balloon-borne telescope observations, the study of meteorite samples from the Antarctic, X-ray telescope studies, and the design of hydrogen masers.
Support from other agencies provided an additional $3.6 million for such varied programs as an ecological study of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, the 1984 Festival of American Folklife, and a mariculture project to study and develop food sources from the sea.
Income from nonappropriated trust fund sources including gifts, grants, endowment and current fund investments, and revenueproducing activities totaled $132,789,000 in fiscal year 1984. After exclusion of expenses necessary to generate auxiliary and bureau activity revenues, net income available for Institutional programs equaled $34,891,000, an increase of $6.7 million or 24 percent, over fiscal year 1983. Of the total net income, $24.7 million, or 71 percent, was available for unrestricted program use and was distributed as approved by the Board of Regents. The balance of approximately $10.2 million was restricted, that is, available only for purposes specified by the benefactor.
Restricted fund revenues of $10.2 million were up $1 million from the previous year. They consisted of $5.9 million from gifts and grants, $3.2 million from endowment investment income and interest earned on restricted current fund balances, and $1.1 million from other sources, primarily fundraising activities at the Archives of American Art and sales desk activities at the Freer Gallery of Art. Restricted endowment investment income served as the major funding source for oceanographic research administered by the National Museum of Natural History; for operations of the Freer Gallery of Art (now included in the Center for Asian Art); and a wide variety of research, exhibition, publication, and educational activities at other Smithsonian bureaus. Major gift support was received during the year for important additions to the collections, including Portrait of Mary Cassatt by Edgar Degas and Callers by Walter Ufer; for major exhibitions being developed by the National Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution Trav-

development of a new, integrated personnel/payroll system also received funding. Transfers to special purpose funds financed the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach Programs ($2,250,000), stipends for preand postdoctoral fellows under the Smithsonian Fellowship program ($1,738,000), income-sharing to the bureaus for their discretionary uses ($638,000), research grants to Smithsonian professional staff ($400,000), and other projects. An amount of $3.4 million was transferred to plant funds for Quadrangle development and for the purchase of a residence for Smithsonian Secretaries. To build the future resources of the Institution, $3.3 million was transferred to unrestricted endowment.
The Unrestricted Special Purpose funds were supplemented by approximately $4.6 million during fiscal year 1984, principally with monies generated by bureau activities. Illustrative of such revenue activities are fees charged for films at the National Air and Space Museum and the admission and membership fees at the CooperHewitt Museum. Investment income earned on unexpended fund balances and from designated endowments added $700,000. Gifts and miscellaneous income, such as zoo parking receipts that are being reserved for future expansion of parking facilities at the National Zoo, brought in another $1.2 million.
Special Foreign Currency Program
Foreign currencies, accumulated primarily from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 83-480 and determined by the Treasury Department to be in excess of the current needs of the United States, are made available to the Institution through the Special Foreign Currency Appropriation. In fiscal year 1984, an appropriation of excess foreign currencies equivalent to $7,040,000 was received under this program by the Smithsonian. Included in this amount was $4 million (as compared to last year’s $2 million) to continue a program of grants to United States institutions for field research and advanced professional training in fields of traditional Smithsonian interest and competence.
An additional $2 million was provided to the Indian rupee reserve account established in fiscal year 1980 to ensure continued program support of the American Institute of Indian Studies. The

<<<Page: 34>>>

Other nonappropriated receipts include grant support for construction of research facilities at the Tropical Research Institute, a donation for relocation of an antique greenhouse, and interest earned on unexpended gifts to plant funds. In addition to the $2.7 million for Quadrangle construction, transfers from unrestricted funds were made for the purchase and improvement of a residence for Smithsonian Secretaries and for mortgage payments on property currently occupied by the National Museum of African Art.
Endowment and Similar Funds
As of September 30, 1984, the market value of the Smithsonian Endowment Fund was $132,416,000, as compared to $132,031,000 on September 30, 1983. Of this, $131,113,000 is invested in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund under outside investment management, $1,000,000 is on permanent deposit in the United States Treasury as required, and the remaining $303,000 includes restricted stock and donated real estate. As shown in Table 10, the majority of the funds, 56 percent ($74,672,000), represents restricted endowment, with income available only for the purposes specified by the donor. The remaining 44 percent ($57,744,000) are unrestricted endowment funds, with income available for general support of the Institution. Certain of the unrestricted funds, such as the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History Endowment, have been designated by the Regents for specific purposes. A complete listing of all endowment funds, together with current book and market values, may be seen in Table 13.
Investment of the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund is subject to policy guidelines established by the Board of Regents. Funds are managed by professional advisory firms under the oversight of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasury. During fiscal year 1984, the number of managers was increased to four with the addition of Granahan-Everitt Investments, Inc. As of the end of the year, the respective portion of the fund by manager was: Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (46 percent), Batterymarch Financial Management (30 percent), Torray Clark & Company (20 percent), and Granahan-Everett Investments, Inc. (4 percent).
For fiscal year 1984, the total rate of return (market appreciation as well as interest and dividend yield) of the Pooled Consolidated

<<<Page: 35>>>

Endowment Fund, as calculated by an independent investment measurement service, was +0.4 percent, as compared to +4.6 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Average and +2.2 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both calculated on the same basis. The year-end market values and the recap of activity of the Consolidated Endowment over the past five years are reflected in Tables 11 and 12, respectively.
Under the Total Return Income policy followed by the Institution, total investment return is defined as yield (interest and dividends) plus appreciation, including both realized and unrealized gains. A portion of this return is made available for expenditure each year, and the remainder is reinvested as principal. This total return income payout is determined in advance of the fiscal year by the Board of Regents based on a review of anticipated interest and dividend yields, support needs of the Institution’s bureaus and scientists, inflationary factors, and the five-year running average of market values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital. After income payout of $3,820,000 in fiscai year 1984 to endowments in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund, $2,794,000 of excess interest and dividend yield was available for reinvestment into endowment principal. Net transfers to endowment, primarily to unrestricted endowment funds, provided an additional $3.5 million with $283,000 received in gifts and other income. At the request of the donor, balances in the Shryock Endowment for Docents were transferred to restricted current funds.
Upon request, a listing of the securities held in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund as of September 30, 1984, may be obtained from the Treasurer of the Institution.

Related Organizations
The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the National Gallery of Art, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts were established by Congress within the Institution. Each organization is administered by its own board of trustees and reports independently on its financial status. Fiscal, administrative, and other support services are provided the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on a reimbursement basis; office space is made available for center operations.

An independent nonprofit corporation, the Friends of the National Zoo (FONZ) operates under contract a number of beneficial concessions for the National Zoological Park. During calendar year 1983 (FONZ’s fiscal year), FONZ concession and rental fees to the Smithsonian amounted to approximately $431,000. In addition, FONZ contributed other important financial and volunteer support to zoo programs. Additional information on FONZ is to be found elsewhere in Smithsonian Year 1984.
Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., associated with the Institution since 1968, now operates as an independent, separately incorporated entity dedicated to the improvement of reading abilities in children. Primary support is derived from private contributions and a federal contract with the Department of Education to operate the Federal Inexpensive Book Distribution Program. Administrative services are offered by the Institution on a contract basis.
For fiscal year 1984, the Smithsonian also provided administrative and fiscal assistance to the Visions Foundation, a start-up venture in the arts.
Accounting and Auditing
The Institution’s funds, federal and nonappropriated, are audited annually by the independent public accounting firm of Coopers and Lybrand. Their report for fiscal year 1984 is reprinted on the following pages. The Smithsonian’s internal audit staff audits Smithsonian activities and financial systems throughout the year. Additionally, the Defense Contract Audit Agency conducts an annual audit of grants and contracts received from federal agencies and monitors allocated administrative costs.
The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents met several times during the year pursuant to their responsibility under the bylaws of the Institution. The committee is charged with reviewing the Smithsonian’s accounting systems and _ internal financial controls; facilitating communication between the Board of Regents and the internal audit staff, the independent accounting firm, and the General Accounting Office; and reviewing operations of the Institution for compliance with approved programs and policies.

To the Board of Regents Smithsonian Institution
We have examined the statement of financial condition of the Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1984 and the related statement of financial activity for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and with generally accepted governmental auditing standards and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We previously examined and reported upon the financial statements of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ended September 30, 1983, totals of which are included in the accompanying financial statements for comparative purposes only.
In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1984, referred to above, present fairly the financial position of the Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1984, and the results of its operations and changes in its fund balances for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation. These financial statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (the Instituition) but are administered under separate boards of trustees. (See Note 2.)
The accounts of the federal funds have been prepared on the obligation basis of accounting, which basis is in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth in the Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The obligation basis of accounting differs in some respects from generally accepted accounting principles. Under this basis of accounting, commitments of the operating fund, such as purchase orders and contracts, are recognized as expenditures, and the related obligations are reported on the balance sheet even though goods and services have not been received. Such commitments aggregated $33,045,000 at September 30, 1984. In addition, construction commitments amounted to $29,552,000 at September 30, 1984.
The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, federal grants and contracts, investment income and certain business activities related to the operations of the Institution. The federal funds reflect the receipt and expenditures of funds obtained from Congressional appropriations.
Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for funds control, accounting and reporting purposes into funds established according to their appropriation, nature, and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institution are reported in self-balancing fund groups as follows:
Trust current funds, which include unrestricted and restricted resources, represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific purposes are segregated from other current funds.
Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment and similar funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds.

<<<Page: 52>>>

Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisitions and funds expended for plant. Pledges for the construction of the Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures are recorded as gifts in the plant fund in the period the pledge document is received.
Federal operating funds consist of separate subfund groups maintained for each appropriation—Salaries and Expenses appropriations, which are available for obligation in the current year only. Special Foreign Currency appropriations and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund, for which unexpended funds from the current year can be carried forward and obligated in subsequent years.
Federal construction funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for building and facility construction, restoration, renovation, and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—Construction and Improvements, National Zoological Park, Restoration and Renovation of Buildings, Museum Support Center and the Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures (Quadrangle).
Federal capital funds represent the amount of the investment of the United States Government in the net assets of the Institution acquired with federal funds and nonexpendable property transfers from Government agencies.
Investments. All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other disposition of investments and property are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar manner, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds. Gains and losses on the sale of investments are recognized using the specific identification method, whereby the cost of the specific security adjusted by any related discount or premium amortization is the basis for recognition of the gain or loss.
Inventory. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, retail cost method (for those inventories held for resale) or net realizable value.
Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smitfisonian Magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription, which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine are charged against income over the period of the subscription.
The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.
Works of art, living or other specimens. The Institution acquires its collections, which include works of art, library books, photographic archives,

<<<Page: 53>>>

objects and specimens, through purchase or by donation. In accordance with policies generally followed by museums, no value is assigned to the collections on the statement of financial condition. Purchases for the collections are expensed currently.
Property and equipment. Capital improvements and equipment purchased with trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years. Equipment purchased with trust funds for use by non-income-producing activities is treated as a deduction of the current fund and a capitalized cost of the plant fund. Depreciation on equipment capitalized in the plant fund is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 3 to 10 years (see Note 9). Equipment purchased with federal funds is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Real estate (land and buildings) purchased with trust funds is recorded at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. Costs of original building structures and major additions are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 30 years. Costs of renovating, restoring and improving structures are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 15 years (see Note 9).
Buildings and other structures, additions to buildings and fixed equipment purchased with federal funds are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 30 years. Costs of renovating, restoring and improving structures are depreciated over their useful lives of 15 years.
Certain lands occupied by the Institution’s buildings were appropriated and reserved by Congress for that purpose and are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. Property and nonexpendable equipment acquired through transfer from Government agencies are capitalized at the transfer price or at estimated amounts, taking into consideration their usefulness, condition, and market value.
Government grants and contracts. The Institution has a number of grants and contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Grant and contract revenue is recognized when billable or received in the trust funds.
Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these statements since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation. Annual leave unfunded. The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual leave in accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the cost of leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense. The cost of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal funds.
2. Related activities
The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several separately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution serve

Pe TS ees Se
on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution facilities occupied, etc. totaled approximately $355,000 for the year ended September 30, 1984. Deposits held in custody for these organizations are $3,029,000 as of September 30, 1984.
The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1984 as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

Since October 1, 1982, the deposit with the U.S. Treasury has been invested in U.S. Government securities at a variable yield based on market interest rates.
Substantially all the investments of the endowment and similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $203.92, 293,996 units were owned by endowment and 348,976 units were owned by quasiendowment at September 30, 1984.
The following tabulation summarizes changes in relationships between cost and market values of the pooled investments:

<<<Page: 56>>>

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from the current funds.
In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such factors as, but not limited to: (1) 442% of the five-year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2) current dividends and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists, and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110°/o of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received. The total return factor for 1984 was $6.74 per unit to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $5.00 per unit to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds; new units were purchased for the Unrestricted Endowment Funds with the $1.74, the difference in the total return factor. The total return applied for 1984 was $2,594,000 to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $1,226,000 to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds.

10. Appropriations
For the year ended September 30, 1984, the Institution was awarded $12,500,000 for various construction projects. Funds appropriated in the prior year for Quadrangle construction were reduced in fiscal year 1984 by $8,000,000.
11. Pension plan
The Institution has separate retirement plans for trust and federal employees. Under the trust fund’s plan, both the Institution and employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1984, was $3,195,000. It is the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently. There are no unfunded prior service costs under the plan.
The federal employees of the Institution are covered by the Civil Service Retirement Program. Under this program, the Institution withholds from the gross pay of each federal employee and remits to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund) the amounts specified by such program. The Institution contributes 7% of basic annual salary to the Fund. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1984, was approximately $5,900,000.
12. Excess expenditures and other deductions
The net excess of expenditures and other deductions over revenue and other additions disclosed for federal construction funds in the Statement of the Activity for the year ended September 30, 1984 arose because certain appropriations, having been recorded as revenue and other additions in prior years and carried forward as fund balance, were expended during the year. Additionally, funds appropriated in the prior year were reduced in fiscal year 1984 (see Note 10).
13. Nonmandatory transfers for designated purposes

14. Income taxes
The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that section are taxable only on their unrelated business income, which was immaterial for the Institution for 1984.
It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such dual status.
