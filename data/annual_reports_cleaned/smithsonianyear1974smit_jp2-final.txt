The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

A Decade of “Increase and Diffusion”
THIS IS THE TENTH Annual Report of the Institution which I have had \the honor to prepare. In these years it has been a surcease to find how stable the aspects of the Smithsonian have been which match the needs of the people. “Increase and diffusion,” that tantalizing phrase, continues to be our watchword. We attempt to adhere steadily to certain goals, and to eschew transitory fads.
This past year in Washington has been one of a kind of misty suspension, like the haze that hangs over the river bottom in the early mornings spring and fall, in our famous marshes of reclaimed land, known as “Foggy Bottom.” This curious state of suspense has been somewhat akin to sitting in an operating theatre, although the surgeons were invisible and the body only faintly lighted in a penumbral shade, waiting for the eclipse to go away. Day by day there were conflicting sounds, adumbrations which swirled about us through the medium of the news. The shadows lengthened during the year as if the operation was too long and the body might turn into a cadaver. But later the pall eased, we breathed again, realizing that the patient would recover, the body politic was alive after all. For in the process we all survived. The surgery had not really been directed entirely to any one person. It has been a kind of psychosurgery or mental vivisection directed at us all, and in the end we may have emerged better, we hope, for the ordeal. From the Smithsonian towers we can document the events, hopeful that in time we can present an objective vision of this segment of the history of our times for those who come to see and learn from our “diffusion.”
In science the Smithsonian’s research, our “increase,” continues in the study of the natural world about us, the objects of creation on the land, the seas, and the phenomena they enclose; and the planets, the

<<<Page: 19>>>

measuring of our Earth against them, the Sun and its effect upon us;| and the steady tabulation of the phenomena of outer space. In history we continue with our encyclopaedic endeavors in the}
they represent.
In art we continue to follow our mandate to preserve, collect, ex-| hibit, and encourage the study of American art, its roots in the rest of| the world, and its current evolution. With the present interest of our! government in sponsoring and supporting the arts and humanities, a new PAVESI) in TSG at Jeast, begins to emerge. Although sepagy
share common tasks, and both work together progressively oll the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. This is especially, important in the forthcoming events of the Bicentennial years. In ad-| dition there is much to interest the Endowments in the new art mu-| seum opening on the Mall in October, 1974, and in the burgeoning; studies in art and art history being undertaken by the various Smith-| sonian enterprises, as well as in the living Folk Festivals. What a! celebration of the American Spirit these Endowments have become,, and how vital their part in encouraging American creativity as well as) cultural history and research! |
All of which is to say that like the Endowments the Smithsonian i ia alive and well, whether in science or in art, and that each year its: purposes and its services are becoming increasingly apparent and: comprehensible to our people. As the Institution becomes more un-, derstood so the morale of its staff improves. We all realize the impor-| tance to our citizens of what we are doing, and this improves our own} quality and our dedication. So be it. |
As we become more important to people, our visitors increase, our) memberships in the Associates increase, our magazine and related, publications and benefits reach out further and further (our member-: ships now are 622,000) and so our responsibilities to be true to our} goals and to increase and diffuse knowledge become more evident. | Our obligations to ourselves for standards and quality have not’ changed, but these very traditions of ours become more visible. As’ this happens, we pay a kind of penalty—that of being noticed. For) years I had thought many of the things that the Smithsonian justi

went on doing quietly and competently were underappreciated and ‘in effect undervalued. Our knowledge about the environment of the planet and our knowledge of the solar system seemed to me so comprehensive that I was disturbed that more people did not know about all this, or that only those in cloistered circles were party to our work and failed to noise it abroad. Now with our new exposure there is by contrast a penalty to popularity. It is what I used to call “joining the old shower club.” By becoming noticed one becomes the subject of uriosity, sometimes the object of criticism, or even envy (if doing things well). We are, I am sure, prepared to pay the penalty for continuing to do well what we are charged with doing, and to that we can say, amen.
Suffice it to affirm that we will continue to prepare to play host to
an increment of several million visitors a year who come in spite of the obstacles of traffic, outmoded transportation, increasing costs, and stultifying living and travel handicaps. And we will continue to ight for their right to come in spite of obstacles placed in their way by time and circumstance. For we know that it is in the interests of the people and their increasing desire to know themselves that they hould come and see our Institution, and we know that in this we ave the support and the enthusiasm of the Congress who continue o find the work of the Smithsonian refreshing.*
Last year I wrote a good deal about the Bicentennial and the Smithonian’s essential activities in the long-past Centennial of 1876. eanwhile, sparked by the new administration under John Warner, the 1976 Bicentennial approaches with every breath we breathe, and our own preparations for “76 wax apace. Our first major Portrait Galery exhibition has opened to critical acclaim. Our renovations of the rts and Industries Building have started in order to make it an evoc-
? Professor Wilcomb Washburn reminds me of a diary entry of Congressman
denry L. Dawes of Massachusetts who came to Washington to serve in 1852, ind speaks of the Institution — _ “The Smithsonian Institute is the noblest of all monuments ever erected in he United States. Washington lives in the affections and reverence of his countymen justly before all others and the great monument going up to his memory s in a corresponding degree an object of interest. (The Washington Monument nas still under construction.) But the Institute is at once a monument and an ngine of power, a fountain of knowledge, a bulwark for the preservation of he liberties Washington bequeathed. It has been founded and is rising in grand ‘ofty proportions ‘for the diffusion of knowledge among men.’ And so long as t shall fulfill its mission fears are idle — Man will be free.”

ative setting of what the Centennial of 1876 was all about. Addition-| ally we are planning on a strong effort to accommodate our visitors | with guidance, information, food, protection, and a sense of wel-'| come and enthusiastic reception. A whole series of things—exhibits, happenings, publications, testaments to human curiosity, and just plain fun—will be awaiting | them in 1976, not least of which will be an entire new museum dedicated to America’s single and most salutary technological achievement, an achievement which has helped to expand and rework our | culture in all its ramifications, the conquest of air and space. Can | there be any insentient people alive today in this country who do not realize that the conquest of air, and now of space, has changed our perspectives, our culture, indeed our ethos? In essence increasingly | rapid modes of flight have abolished time, pressed the concept of communications close to human tolerance through the continuing | evolution of the computer, helped to abolish faith, and prepared us for anew and as yet uncharted way of viewing the human condition. | America, I hope, will be thinking of 2076 by the time the Bicenten| nial comes along. And in that connection we might as well have a |
| look at the panorama showing how we reached our present predica| ment. Our untrammeled will to succeed, to better our style of life i through our communication and transport, has put us where we are. | We could call our Air and Space Museum last year’s Pandora’s Box, | and looking in visualize what we had better do about next year’s. For | we have not stopped the clock in the past, and if we are to slow it down in the future we will have to realize what has been happening | to make so much of that future inevitable. In his recent (1974) short book, Robert Heilbroner questions the continued hegemony of | organized science under the present threat of anew Dark Age for our | civilization. That we face the possibility of anew Dark Age in history _ is evident to many. As an ecologist, I have found the recent discus| sions of economists and social scientists on the subject of the inter: dependence of population trends and the use of natural resources, | agriculture, industrial growth, and pollution, a kind of coming home > to roost, neo-Malthusian thinking caught up with Volterra-Gause © hypotheses of strategies of competition in nature. Heilbroner believes | that science and technology have developed in an inimical manner to foster runaway population, cataclysmic wars, and environmental — degradation without compensating restraints and standards, includ-

ing moral and ethical controls. He postulates that religion will and must rise again to insure the reawakening of civilization itself. As with a see-saw, he envisages science losing its paramountcy as religion arises once more. This to me is overly simplistic. An economist can afford perhaps to be an agnostic, but most philosophically inclined scientists—physicists (who perforce must be philosophers), molecular biologists, and the best of the ecologists—will tell you that they hold to an essential faith in laws of creation, which are indeed the moral and ethical presumption on which religion is based. Whatever limits to creation we may have plumbed, it is a popular fiction to assume that in the process scientists have destroyed our faith. All of which is not to say that it is not worthwhile to have men of the caliber of Heilbroner, as social scientists, becoming aware of ecological principles. Jan Tinbergen, winner of the Nobel prize in eco‘nomics, told me recently that he owed a great part of his somewhat unorthodox theoretical assumptions to new insights he had gained from his brother Nikolaas, a Nobel prize winner in biological medi‘cine, who is a pioneer in the study of the behavior of animals under field conditions, away from laboratory controls, where they are guided by and demonstrate ecological principles. It is sad that the social sciences have classically paid so little attention to the broad truths of ecology. | In the past year we had the novel experience of the turning off of the taps which supply our gasoline pumps, and Americans—repre| senting six percent of the world’s population but conditioned to gobbling up nearly forty percent of the world’s resources—are just | now beginning to get the message. Our massive indifference to international bureaux and offices talking about one-world politics, ecoemacs, and world interdependence has been conditioned over the years by the perfect conviction that being an American is a natural ‘condition which we assume carries with it all the perquisites of technological superiority over our fellow inhabitants of the planet. No matter that there are inequities in the United States itself—-we know that also—but what many citizens, temporarily enraged by such in‘equities, overlook is our commonly held assumption, all of us, that the automobile and the open road, the shopping center, and the fantastic and dazzling distribution of material goods at all levels is a ‘natural right. As Americans, either richer or poorer, we have it way ‘over eighty percent of the rest of the people of the world.

Whether we deserve it all or not seldom gives us pause, although last winter’s threat of gas rationing was at least a temporary aberration in the hiatus between winter holidays and summer vacation. 3 Now that the gas taps have turned on again, it is easy to believe that | all’s right with the world once more. It is easy to forget the unpleasantness of the spectre of declining resources.
In this state of vague malaise the conviction has come to many younger and also minority group members that the survival of the } Republic is uncertain. Whereas historians or political scientists glori| fied the successes of America, based on the application of intelligence, others such as Jean-Francois Revel now describe what is hap| pening in America as a revolution, which indeed it is. But we can take | heart in his definition of revolution, provided ethics survive, for in | the process we may approach a truer mode of life and an understand| ing of what we are about. I have written before of what the Smith| sonian could provide as a means of exhibiting this process of understanding. I feel it could be done in what I have called a Museum of | the Family of Man, a synthesis of thinking about man’s place in the | universe.
People in the United States have come full circle in their ideas. Two | generations ago and more the thought was that this new frontier, this I boundless Nation, would serve as a melting pot wherein all would | be remade into an indigenous American mold. Here all the nations — would provide of their best, most daring, and adventurous spirits, who, in this heady atmosphere of opportunity, would become blended into what de Tocqueville and others thought of as the new American breed. |
The romantic spirit, descendant of the philosophical idealism of | the spirit of the revolutions, took no account of the remainder of the | native Americans, that remnant which thoughtful men at the time of the Nation’s Centennial had feared would have gone extinct by the | twentieth century. Nor were the blacks or Mexican-Americans con| sidered. Eighty years later, by the 1930s, the Indian population was | recovering from its doldrums of the turn of the century, the Mexican _ and Latin American minorities were increasing in the Southwest and _ | in the eastern urban centers, and the blacks—Raymond Pearl had | prophesied that the black population would disappear for genetic | reasons in two hundred years or so. Instead of homogenization we . now, approaching our Bicentennial, celebrate ethnic diversity and

<<<Page: 24>>>

cultural pluralism. Whether our blacks or other minority types with recognizable physical features disappear or not is moot. Black is beautiful and the liberated American today eschews the melting pot
and embraces the reawakened realization that traditions of old ways
persist in the New World, that song, dance, drama, the arts, lan-
guage—all the stuff of culture—continue to exist, to be perpetuated in strongly persistent patterns. We cannot entirely forget our
cultural heritage even as a multiplicity of physical types remains
permanent in our midst. Perhaps then we have learned a lesson that biologists of years ago would have been tempted to support, that blending inheritance is far more rare than the persistence of basic traits and types, and that cultural patterns mirror in their perseverance these physical verities.
Under the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Smithsonian, too, should come full circle. We can create a summing up of the American experience, a synthesis of all that we have learned, the interactions of man on this part of the planet, the interface between
_ ourselves and our environment. A Museum of the Family of Man
then would include certain demonstrable American themes, includ-
_ing the history of the United States folk, who had come here, when _and how, and how this had changed the land and sea and air, its past
and present face. Hopefully, such an illumination of our times could
include, with the aid of computer systems and current technology, an informed projection of our evolution, both physically and culturally, into the future, our own “Brave New World.”
More importantly, as my colleague Under Secretary Brooks has
_ emphasized, such a museum must suggest the continuing process of
man’s evolution as a creator. As he phrases it, “From all the testa-
ments of man’s creativity, we can recognize at least two kinds of
multi-millennial chains of men and women who have created things,
technique’, or concepts relating to the physical world. The first kind
is in its important phase pre-literate and inventive; it has evolved the
_ basic physical conditions of human society and survival— as for in-
stance the cultivation of grains, domestication of animals, shelter, mobility, etc. The second kind of succession is post-literate and con-
-ceptual; it has evolved understanding of the world, the universe,
man’s own nature, and the structures of thought itself. The two have
common ground but different approaches to understanding, and de-
serve equal honor. They proceed in common from man’s bio-psycho-

logical heritage—his visual brain, manual dexterity, capacity for use
of symbols and language.”
To suggest the process means, of course, to avoid the static quality of museums encompassed in arrays of finite objects, but rather to formulate a kind of multimedia display, “engaging the viewer’s own processes of thought and imagination.” The process is a speed-up process too. From the unique fact that evolution provided the tools, man’s ability to communicate effectively, and the evolution of manual dexterity, has come the unfolding of brain integration in these functions. Each system has buffered and supported the other, developing an end product unlike any other known on the planet. Thus the diverging into the two types of creativity: the technologies of survival and the evolution of thought. In this latter aspect of creativity there are the social inventions: ‘elaborations upon the family, the tribe, the state, the organs of justice, legislation, administration, caste, class, trade, education, war.” Then there is the invention of social institutions, ““and the creators who formulated social thought
and promoted social action.” These historical creations are all rooted —
in man’s biological heritage as well, and of course have speeded up enormously along with the evolution of technology.
In any discussion of process it is instructive to speculate about the — possibility, achieved five years ago, of landing a man on the moon. | Although the technologies existed to create orbiting machines in
space, James Webb has pointed out to me that the human factor, the men who could manipulate the machines effectively enough to land themselves on the lunar surface, and then blast off again to join up with their circling companion, must have been brought up from childhood in an atmosphere where the commonplaces of advanced
technology all worked. Communication by telephone, for example, is —
randomly so taken for granted in the U.S.A., because the telephones
work so relatively perfectly, that we are brought up and accustomed © to have perfect transmittal of ideas or mechanical concepts in using —
them. We do not have to have meetings or conferences face to face. Our generations of people are thus habituated for learning and the transfer of vital information in a way that a considerable part of the
rest of the world’s population is not, or has not been until very re|
cently indeed. Thus the time lags implicit in technological condition-
ing and familiarity make for different phased levels of assimilation ©
of the processes of learning. The chances, therefore, are that only
10 / Smithsonian Year 1974

one particular segment of peoples or culture may be capable of landing on the moon at any one time. And I might add, at the risk of sounding complacent or overweening, that even the prospect of a perfect link-up in space as between the products of two cultures, our own and the U.S.S.R.’s, may be more difficult because of the background and training of the participants than our global strategists and politicians would wish.
This is one example of a truism in contemplating the history of the family of man. No one group or segment of man, through the biological and physical phenomena of geographical isolation, is exactly like any other at points in time, as well as through the panorama of history, thus horizontally as well as vertically in a diagrammatic sense. No museums have ever entirely encompassed all of the philosophical and moral and physical implications which have resulted in our complex world. It is a new way of looking at a subject that goes back to ideas expressed in the last century, vested in the creation of the Musée de l’Homme in Paris in 1877. Unfortunately the Musée de l’‘Homme was an anthropology museum, and as I have said elsewhere,” until very recently it had been thought, rather uncomfortably, that anthropology, being a kind of biological discipline, should concentrate on early man and the present so-called primitive races of man, leaving Western civilization to the classicists and the students of folk history and the decorative arts. This situation has now begun to change. In Washington we are thinking of drawing from everything that our museums, whether of natural history, history of science, culture and technology, or art museums, are exhibiting, each in its own way. We are concerned here with a new concept, a synthesis of the whole family of man and how it got that way.
Interestingly enough we are not alone in this idea. We claim no hegemony, of course. At the 1974 meeting of the International Council of Museums held in Copenhagen, Mme. Nelly Motrocilova of the Academy in Moscow, speaking on June 3rd, announced that the U.S.S.R. too was thinking of the creation of a Museum of Man. Suffice it to say that we shall be threshing out this concept over the next year or two with ourselves, our committees such as the Smithsonian Council, and individual colleagues, with the hope that eventu-

ally we can present a plan to the Congress for a new kind of museum which could somehow embody the dreams of their constituencies across this land, the realization by people of the United States that their strength lies in the strength of their origins, their diversity and the pride, courage, and hope that this can and must give them. Let there be no despair then but a reasoned pride, measured with courage and tempered with the sobering responsibilities that such selfknowledge brings. The soothsayers and necromancers of today adjure the young to think of themselves first, to cultivate their id, to think first of “happiness” in a subjective sense. They have forgotten, and the young with them, that they are not alone, but that within themselves rests all the history of man.
The Institution’s “increase,” its research progress in history, the arts, and the sciences, is listed in Smithsonian Year 1974. Suffice it to say that both in astronomy and astrophysics, work under Director George Field is taking form in programs of great promise, particularly in regard to new observations of the Sun made during the flight of the Orbiting Space Laboratory in the past year. Additionally, successful research and construction proceeds in concert with the University of Arizona on the multiple-mirror telescope. In the National Museum of Natural History a vigorous new array of exhibits is in the planning stage under the direction of Dr. Porter Kier. Temperate and tropical environmental studies are being vigorously pursued at our stations in the United States as well as in Panama.
In the latter, significant efforts to enhance the staff as well as the inventory-taking capability of the stations should begin to narrow the gap between what we know about the New World tropics and what limits to tolerance they possess in the face of man’s destructive abilities. For in the vast New World tropics where, contrary to conventional wisdom, perhaps only ten percent of the land is susceptible to agriculture, there is precious little time to measure the norms of the tropical environment. Human population pressure is seeing to that, be it for better or worse. Few biologists could argue that anything that is happening in the tropics today is for the better, but their voices will not be heard in the tendentious political clamour of the developing world. At the very least we hope that the data we gather will serve as a guide to the essential diversity of the tropical environment and as an indicator for the future of the riches we seem about to forsake so willfully. The recent remarks on May 29th by the new
12 / Smithsonian Year 1974

President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez, concerning that coun-
try’s proposed national policy on conservation of natural resources
are splendid, however. If Latin America, with some of the poorest soils in the world, could heed President Perez’ speech then biologists could breathe easier.
Finally in the realm of science, a great step forward this past year has been the beginning of the National Zoo’s breeding project and reserve at Front Royal, Virginia. Here is a conservation project in a superb setting, which we hope will become a model of its kind, with room for cooperation with zoological societies all over the country.
In history our staff has collected the Institution’s first Pulitzer prize in the person of Professor Daniel Boorstin and his third volume on The Americans: The Democratic Experience. All of us can take pride in the outstanding historicoliterate achievements of this famous historian, who has resumed work as a Senior Historian after four busy years as Director of the National Museum of History and Technology. In this latter capacity he has been succeeded by another eminent historian, Professor Brooke Hindle, sometime Dean, Arts and Sciences, University College, at New York University, and head of that university’s Department of History for many years. Mr.
_ Hindle is particularly an historian of science, and his coming is a matter of great joy to all of us.
In the Museum of History and Technology this year we have also celebrated the creation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research—a center for studies in the origins of war and peace, headed by Professor Forrest C. Pogue, one of the preeminent military historians of our time. This is a splendid augury for the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board and may well be its most salient contribution to the preservation of military history.
In the past year the Freer Gallery has celebrated its semicentennial with thr splendid exhibitions accompanied by internationally attended symposia, as well as the publication of lucid and beautifully _ illustrated catalogues, and with the awarding of three Freer medals. No one could fail to be heartened by the renewed interest in Chinese, Japanese, and Islamic art which these exhibitions underscored. Over 200 scholars and students attended the colloquia, which were in_ tensely interesting and of high scholarly caliber. A symptom of the _ universal importance placed on art in Japan was a special visit during his stay in Washington by Prime Minister K. Tanaka.

The National Portrait Gallery continued its striking series of historical exhibits with a splendid exhibition and accompanying historical resource document, a catalogue on the Black Presence in the American Revolution. Once again the Portrait Gallery has charted a new and authoritative course in untraveled seas. I believe it is obvious by now to most historians that this technique of exhibition and wholly definitive catalogues is a new and unsuspected teaching tool to remind us, as I have said earlier, that within us all resides the history of man.
The National Collection of Fine Arts has continued its imaginative program of exhibits, including a revealing one on the history of the plastic arts in recent time in the Pacific Northwest. I personally was _much moved by the evidence from the paintings of the expression via palette tonalities of the difference between living in Oregon and in Washington. Even in abstracts or in interiors the painters were

dence of the mood and atmosphere, the light and color of the two States. What reflections cannot be drawn on the origins of ethnicity, of phenotypic differences, of cultural subspeciation in such happenings?
A delightful footnote to the history of American art was the ex| hibition of the work of “Lilly Martin Spencer: The Joys of Sentiment,” the catalogue of which contains a brilliant introduction by Director Joshua Taylor. The ncra’s collection of American portrait miniatures, one of the best in this country, was placed on permanent exhibition through the generosity of the Trustees of the Merrill Trust. A special gallery designated the “Doris M. Magowan Gallery of Portrait Miniatures” will exhibit these portrait miniatures for the first time.
The substantial completion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in this past year has signaled the arrival of the mammoth collections of art in Washington and their incipient debut in their new public setting, an event long awaited. We anticipate formally opening the museum on October 1, 1974. This museum should help to illuminate Joseph Henry’s theme that the Mall is indeed a people’s park, a place of delight for citizens. The gloomy myths about the sacred sward and the hallowed ground were no more a part of the original concept of the Republic than any other Victorian

conceits. The Mall is for all of the citizens of the United States and by no means a cemetery.
In this past year an additional West Coast branch of the Archives of American Art has been opened by our energetic director, William Woolfenden, and the Presidency has been assumed by Dr. Irving Burton after three years of devoted work by Howard Lipman, who now becomes President of the Board of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. We are deeply grateful to all these able workers in the collation of the history of American art.
The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in New York continues with its reconstruction plans for the Carnegie Mansion, for which over $1 million has already been raised. Under the energetic chairmanship of Lewis A. Lapham, who has succeeded Thomas J. Watson, Jr., as Chairman of the National Associates Board, a subcommittee has been formed to enlist the support of New York members, residents, and their wives to complete the reconstruction of the site for our National Museum of Design.
Nearer at home our management enterprises and our reexamination of our structure proceed apace. In any sensible organization there must come periodic assessments of where one is and where one is going. In the process of keeping track of our “fragmented parts which make a whole,” as Joshua Taylor has described us, we periodically check the pace of our development. Are we running ourselves ragged with too many activities? Can we achieve the discipline to confine ourselves to our stated goals before natural accumulations run away with us? For in the sense of our museums and collections, the Smithsonian is a growth industry. Perhaps museums are one of the only legitimate growth industries left? I think we can manage +o stay the course by perceiving common themes that unite us intellectually, and not simply approach efficient controls as an administrative function. For in our hope to “increase and diffuse knowledge among men” lies an ideal as well as a responsible charge. We monitor the processes continually, firm in our determination to illuminate that ideal.
In the realm of “diffusion,’”’ this past year has seen the Smithsonian undertake a new series of television programs under the direction of David Wolper, with sponsorship by the du Pont Company. The first program on matters of Smithsonian interest is expected to be re-

leased in November, 1974. In all of these enterprises with new attempts to increase and diffuse knowledge an enormous amount of credit is due to the staff of this Institution, which in its many ramifications continues its devotion and effective assistance to our cause at all levels.
As part of the Smithsonian Product Development program, reports indicate that in addition to previously approved craft items, there will be authentic reproductions of pewter, silver, and textiles, all based on existing Smithsonian documentation.
During the past year I have lost two of my friends. For the ten years of my tenure I have had the perfect conviction of longevity, secure in the belief that my three predecessors would be continually available as counsellors and reminders of the continuity of our hopes for the Institution. As I have noted in Smithsonian (November, 1973, and February, 1974), Dr. Wetmore and I have lost our two colleagues, Dr. Leonard Carmichael, my predecessor as Secretary, on September 16,1973, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, his immediate predecessor as Secretary, on December 17, 1973. Together we had seemed a continuous chain, reaching back in time to when the Republic itself was less than a century old. They had helped and encouraged me to celebrate our own Smithson bicentennial in 1965, the 200th Anniversary of our Founder’s birth, a noble occasion reminding us all of the academic and intellectual links of institutions like our own around the world. We mourn their passing and the loss of contact with the past which always helps to prepare us for the premonitions of the future.

Board of Regents
THE BOARD OF REGENTS held three meetings in fiscal year 1974. The autumn meeting, convened on September 21, 1973, was designated The Leonard Carmichael Memorial Meeting in honor of Dr. Carmichael, the seventh Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. As an appropriate tribute to his memory, the Regents unanimously declared that the auditorium of the National Museum of History and _ Technology, constructed during his tenure, hereafter be known as _ the Leonard Carmichael Auditorium. A ceremony dedicating the Au_ ditorium was held on January 21, 1974, presided over by the Chancellor, accompanied by music and with tributes from Dr. John Har_ per, Rector of St. John’s Church, Dr. Melvin Payne, President of theNational Geographic Society, and the Secretary.
The new Chairman of the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, Mr. Lewis A. Lapham succeeding Mr. Thomas J. Watson, _ Jr., was assured of enthusiastic support by the Regents, who endorsed the concept that the Institutional Development Committee of _the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates undertake the Cooper-Hewitt capital fund raising as its first effort.
Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1955 to 1973, retired in July, 1973, and is to continue his work as Senior Research Scientist. The Regents voted to award him the Henry Medal in recognition of his important contri_ butions to the Institution.
Mr. Gordon N. Ray, Chairman of the Smithsonian Council, who was present, briefly reviewed the activities of the Council since its _ inception, citing its membership, its considerations, and conclusions. The Board of Regents thanked Mr. Ray for his efforts and conveyed appreciation to the Council members for their interest and work in _ behalf of the Institution.
The appointment of James H. Billington as Director of the Wood_ row Wilson International Center for Scholars was announced.
The death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, a great benefactor
of the Smithsonian Institution, occurred on September 12, 1973. A
Statement by the Secretary / 19

<<<Page: 35>>>

Smithsonian Committee was organized to work with the representatives of Mrs. Post’s estate and foundation to facilitate an orderly transfer of the property and collections bequeathed to the Smithsonian.
Subsequently the Board of Regents, their wives, members of the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, and the Chairman of the Smithsonian Council gathered for the presentation of the James Smithson Benefactor Medallion to Thomas J. Watson, Jr., for his important contributions to the Smithsonian Institution.
The January 25, 1974, meeting of the Board of Regents was designated The Charles Greeley Abbot Memorial Meeting in tribute to the Smithsonian Institution’s fifth Secretary, whose death occurred in December at the age of 101. Appropriately, the Radiation Biology Laboratory will bear Dr. Abbot’s name henceforward, since this aspect of the Institution’s research owes its genesis, in 1929, to Dr. Abbot.
The meeting took place at the Fort Pierce Bureau of the Smithsonian Institution located at Fort Pierce, Florida, including the Harbor Branch Laboratory, as well as the research barge and the RV Johnson. Secretary Ripley explained the history of the Fort Pierce Bureau, its programs, and its plans for the future. A tour of the facilities included brief talks by staff members, a tour of the model shop, inspection of the submersible, and a demonstration of the launch and recovery of the submarine.
It was with great reluctance that the Executive Committee accepted the decision of Crawford Greenewalt not to stand for reappointment after serving for eighteen years as an outstanding and distinguished Regent.
The Regents accepted the Acee Blue Eagle collection of paintings and artifacts in order to foster interest in and understanding of American Indian art and culture. It will be housed in the Anthropological Archives of the Department of Anthropology of the National Museum of Man.
The Smithsonian was granted a permit by the General Services Administration for use of the former Beef Cattle Experiment Station at Front Royal, Virginia; the National Zoological Park plans initially to utilize this reserve for a breeding project.
The spring meeting of the Board was held in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian Building on May 14, 1974. A Nominating Commit-
20 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 36>>>

tee appointed by the Chancellor submitted its recommendation for a new Citizen Regent and for reappointment of two other Citizen Regents whose terms were to expire. Joint resolutions were recommended to be introduced in the Congress for these appointments.
The Board authorized acceptance of a Zeiss planetarium instrument, a Bicentennial gift from the Federal Republic of Germany. This will be installed in the National Air and Space Museum to simulate the wonders of space and is expected to be operating when the Museum opens in July, 1976. The instrument is to be named in honor of the late Albert Einstein.
The Regents received the report of the second Smithsonian Priorities Conference convened at the Belmont Conference Center on February 19-21, 1974, which pointed out in detail the progress of Smithsonian programs in the past year, and recommended additional steps to be taken in administration and management within the Institution. Coupled with this were copies of a new survey of buildings and facilities owned or occupied by the Institution.

Smithsonian Year 1974
CONTINUED SOUND PROGRESS was shown in Smithsonian finances in fiscal year 1974. Thanks to increased federal support and further improvement in results of the Institution’s own educational and revenue-generating efforts, we were able to cope satisfactorily with the large inflation-bred rise in costs of salaries, supplies, and services, and, at the same time, to strengthen our current operating funds position.
Added federal appropriations enabled us to increase needed museum protection and other support services and to step up preparations for our important 1976 Bicentennial commitments. These included steady progress on construction and future exhibits for the new National Air and Space Museum and a beginning on a major long-term reconstruction of National Zoological Park facilities. An additional $1-million gift from the donor of the collections permitted completion of the construction of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Other gifts and grants for specific purposes funded a wide variety of research and exhibit activities.
There remains an urgent need for major outside contributions in support of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design and a large number of other specific projects. Also, the Institution’s endowment funds — always far from adequate for an Institution of this size — experienced during the year a worrisome drop in value. In other respects, however, Smithsonian finances can be said to have improved substantially in fiscal year 1974. Full detail of these results is provided below.

<<<Page: 39>>>

Overall Sources and Application of Financial Support
The total financial support available to the Institution from all} sources is shown in Table 1. These figures do not include the finances: of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for} Scholars, which are all related legislatively to the Smithsonian but! whose financial and administrative affairs are for the most part sepa| rately managed under independent Boards of Trustees.
Total funds for operating purposes rose to $82,681,000 in fiscal |) year 1974, an increase of $10,607,000 over the preceding year. Fed+ eral appropriations of $65,063,000 accounted for 78.7 percent of they total, research grants and contracts 12.1 percent, and nonfederal in: come 9.2 percent; this ratio of support was roughly the same in fiscal |) year 1973. In addition, Congress provided $21,860,000 in construc| tion funds for continuing work on the National Air and Space Mu| seum, for repairs to other Smithsonian buildings, and for the Na| tional Zoological Park, principally for “Lion Hill,” a major beginning | on the long-term renovation plan of Zoo facilities. :
In Table 2, these revenues from all sources (excluding construction || funds and the Special Foreign Currency Program) and their applica-' tion to individual Smithsonian bureaus and activities are shown in| considerable detail, demonstrating the complexity of funding resulting from the variety of resources and the large number of diversified ’ services provided.
Federal appropriations for operating purposes totaled $65,063,000), including $1,695,000 for the Smithsonian Science Information Ex+ change, a separately incorporated organization, and $4,500,000 for’ the Special Foreign Currency Program (in the blocked currency of’ certain foreign countries). The Special Foreign Currency Program | administers grants to United States universities and similar organi» zations for research studies in Egypt, India, Pakistan, Poland, Tu| nisia, and Yugoslavia (see Table 3). This program included a special | $1,000,000 amount (to be renewed for three additional years) to al| low United States participation in UNESCO’s international campaign. to preserve archeological monuments on the Island of Philae in |
Egypt.

Excluding these special-purpose appropriations for the Science Information Exchange and the Foreign Currency Program, federal operating funds amounted to $58,868,000. This is $7,235,000 more than fiscal year 1973, but $4,180,000 (58 percent) of this substantial increase is attributable solely to meeting the costs of federal pay raises of various categories beyond the Institution’s control. The balance of the increase, $3,055,000, went primarily to three highpriority program objectives. These were (1) preparation of exhibits and related work of the National Air and Space Museum scheduled to open in its new building on the Mall on July 4, 1976; (2) development of special Washington, D. C., and national Bicentennial activities; and (3) phased strengthening of supporting services such as museum object conservation; reference and research libraries; automatic data processing applications to research, collections, and administrative activities; and buildings and facilities care and protection. Allocation of the appropriations for operating purposes (excluding the Foreign Currency Program) by broad activity areas ove the past several years is shown in Table 4.
It may be of interest to note that in performance terms about $12.5 million of the fiscal year 1974 appropriation was spent on basic re-
search in art, history, and science; $4.2 million on the acquisition |
and management of collections (only a few hundred thousand dollars
of this were available for the purchase of objects); $7.1 million for |

Grants and contracts from federal agencies once again contributed in a major way to the Institution’s research programs, predominantly in scientific disciplines. $9,996,000 of these funds was expended in fiscal year 1974, up from $8,996,000 in fiscal year 1973. The major recipient, accounting for over half of the total expenditures, continued to be the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for such projects as the monitoring of Comet Kahoutek, meteor studies, and design of hydrogen maser systems. Other projects ranged from ecological studies in South America and Asia to research on American folklore. Table 5 shows
the major granting agencies to the Smithsonian over a four-year | period, representing several hundred different grants and contracts |
each year.
Originally established entirely with funds from Mr. Smithson’s be| quest, the Institution has, over a long period of years, derived an in| creasing proportion of its support from federal appropriations as it | was entrusted with more national collections and expanded its re|
search and public exhibitions.
It is now an important goal of Smithsonian administration to bol| ster the Institution’s private resources in line with or exceeding the | growth of its federal support, in order to restore a better balance be|
tween the two, thereby helping to preserve its uniquely flexible and independent character among national establishments. Despite the
many serious economic uncertainties of this past 12-month period, | fiscal year 1974 results were in line with this goal. Receipts (includ| ing those for operating purposes, land acquisition, and building con| struction) from gifts, investment income, revenue-producing activi| ties, fees, and other revenues all increased to record levels, with the |
total equaling $8,954,000 (not including $105,000 gifts to endow-
ment funds). Of this total $5,598,000 was designated for specific | restricted purposes; this latter amount was fractionally higher than | in fiscal year 1973, while income for unrestricted purposes rose from |
$1,013,000 to $3,356,000 (see Table 6).

The substantial increase in unrestricted general purpose private funds in fiscal year 1974 was extremely welcome and enabled the Institution for the first time to reserve private monies for plant improvements not believed to be obtainable from federal appropriations but which will enhance our ability to serve the public and which may, at the same time, lead to increased private support in the years ahead. The build-up of the general unrestricted fund balance to a more adequate level of $3,067,000 also means that portions of any similar gains in future years may also be used for this purpose or to strengthen our present low endowment reserves.
As may be seen in Table 7, the increase in income before transfers to other funds, equaling $2,336,000 in fiscal year 1974 compared to $688,000 in fiscal year 1973, arose in part from a jump in investment income but, more importantly, from successful results of our educational and revenue-producing activities. There was, at the same time, a somewhat offsetting rise in administrative costs, partly from salary and other administrative cost increases (including an initial charge of $198,000 to establish a reserve for employees’ accrued annual leave), but also reflecting greater assistance to a number of bureaus for special needs and urgent research projects.
The increase in investment income this year resulted primarily from the build-up in working capital and advance Smithsonian magazine subscription monies which made more funds available for investment in high quality short-term issues at prevailing high interest rates. As may be noted on the Balance Sheet, page 48, current fund investments equaled $8,298,000 as of June 30, 1974, compared to $6,223,000 a year earlier; of the former amount, $6,600,000 was invested in very high grade, short-term securities and bank certificates of deposit.
The Smithsonian magazine was responsible for the largest share of the net gain from revenue-producing activities. As shown in Table 8, its income for the year rose to $1,327,000, from $330,000 in the previous year. At June 30, 1974, there were 622,000 National Associate members and subscribers to the magazine, making it one of the fastest growing publications in the Nation. The Associates program also contributed heavily to this year’s gains, with net income of $263,000, versus a slight loss in fiscal year 1973. The Resident Asso-

* The privately funded activities of the Press as opposed to the federally supported publication of research papers. ** Includes Traveling Exhibitions, Belmont Conference Center, Photo Sales, ‘“Commons” Restaurant, Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, Special Publications, and Television Programs. *** This includes allocations to the Press and other Smithsonian bureaus participating in this program.
The profitability of the Museum Shops also increased dramatically, from $47,000 in fiscal 1973 to $226,000 in fiscal 1974, due in large measure to improved management practices and increased emphasis on higher quality merchandise relevant to the collections exhibited in the various Smithsonian museums. As with the Product Development Program, which transferred $33,000 of royalities to individual bureaus, income from the Museum Shops will in the future be shared with the museums for their use in public education programs and purchases for the collections.
The Performing Arts Division produced an extremely successful record album, the History of Jazz, which enabled them to show a gain of $104,000 in this fiscal year, as opposed to a deficit of $65,000

in fiscal year 1973. Another “bestseller” was the guidebook, Seeing
the Smithsonian, developed by the Smithsonian Press and Product
Development Offices in cooperation with the css Publishing Com-
pany; its sales added substantially to the profitability of the Museum
Shops.
As any surplus funds accrue from project receipts of the shops or the Associates program an appropriate effort is made to return this in kind to the public in the form of improved public facilities, improved public reference books or publications, and improved public exhibits. As an example, the unusually large net gain in unrestricted private funds in fiscal year 1974 coincided with urgent requirements for construction funds, necessitating transfers of $1,134,000 to the Institution’s plant funds, with other transfers to Special Purpose funds, Restricted Funds, and Endowment Funds bringing total transfers to $1,561,000 (see Table 7). Of the transfers to plant funds, $365,000 was set aside to redesign and reconstruct the museum shop in the National Museum of History and Technology. Another $500,000 was reserved for a part of the costs of the proposed construction of additional public service facilities in the West Court of the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History. Finally, $150,000 was transferred to cover a part of the cost of a visitor’s study center at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, and $119,000 was transferred for computer and equipment purchases. Other transfers from unrestricted funds include allocations toward operations of the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum ($178,000), special research grants to
Smithsonian scientists ($49,000), and transfers to Endowment
($121,000) which includes a bequest of $100,000 from the estate of _ Paula Lambert.
A new category of unrestricted private funds (‘Special Purpose’) is set out separately this year, namely, those which are legally unrestricted but which have been designated by management to be reserved for specific uses (see Table 6). These accounts, previously treated as a part of Restricted Funds, include, for example, receipts from parking at the Zoo (reserved to aid future construction of additional parking facilities for visitors), and revenues from various minor enterprises in individual museums (e.g., charges for tourguide audiophone equipment, etc.) and related expenditures of these monies, chiefly for improvement of exhibits. As of June 30, 1974, ' balances of these funds totaled $460,000, an increase of $259,000 in | the year.

The Restricted Private Funds of the Institution, which support a wide variety of activities even beyond the major ones highlighted in Table 9, received $4,266,000 for operating purposes in fiscal year 1974. The Freer Gallery of Art and the Fort Pierce Bureau depend primarily on income from their endowment funds, while the CooperHewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design and the Archives of American Art, although receiving some federal support, must look to gifts, grants, memberships, and various money-raising efforts for their principal operating funds. In addition, it was necessary to transfer $178,000 of private unrestricted funds to Cooper-Hewitt in fiscal year 1974 to eliminate operating deficits accumulated over this and previous years.
In September 1973, at the death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, the responsibility for her “Hillwood” estate and the extraordinary collections it contains passed to the Smithsonian. A trust fund

<<<Page: 52>>>

was provided by her will for the maintenance and operation of Hillwood, but the estate had not yet been settled at year-end; part-year income and expenditures for this new project are reflected in the Restricted Private Funds table.
The National Museum of History and Technology is conducting a fund-raising campaign, with strong support from industry, to enable creation of a new exhibit “Hall of American Maritime Enterprise” devoted to national marine history. As of June 30, 1974, $166,000 had been raised with additional pledges received of over $100,000.
A gift of $1 million was received from Joseph H. Hirshhorn in fiscal year 1974 to be used to complete construction of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, due to open to the public in October 1974. This gift is reflected in the restricted gifts total in Table 6 in the category of Plant Funds along with other gifts and miscellaneous revenues for the new Chesapeake Bay Center building ($70,000) and renovation of the Carnegie Mansion for the Cooper-Hewitt Museum ($262,000).
The Smithsonian endowment includes three separate investment funds: the Freer Fund, whose income is used solely by the Freer Gal-
_lery of Art; Endowment Fund No. 3, which supports oceanographic _ research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida; and the Consolidated _ Fund, which is an investment pool of all other Smithsonian restricted : and unrestricted endowment funds, although distinct administration and accounting is maintained on each individual fund. Changes in | market values of these funds since 1970, reflecting additions from
donations and reinvestment of income, limited withdrawals, and
_ changes in securities valuations are shown in Table 10.

As shown in Table 11, the market values of the endowment funds
suffered badly in fiscal year 1974, sharing fully in the general stock market decline. This fall in market values will have the effect in fiscal year 1975 of reducing the Total Return income to the Freer and Consolidated Funds to somewhat below the level of fiscal year 1974, although still higher than prior years.

Gifts, bequests, and reinvestment of income in certain restricted funds added $297,000 to the Consolidated Fund, and a transfer of $300,000 was made from Endowment Fund No. 3 to permit completion of the RV Johnson submarine tender as well as to cover costs relating to the entrapment of the submersible Johnson-Sea-Link in June 1973. Income totaling $1,948,000, net of managers’ fees, was paid out under the Total Return policy described above; this was $355,000 in excess of dividend and interest yield on these Endowment Funds in the year. Market valuations and income of the individual restricted funds participating in the Consolidated pool are shown in Table 12, and detail on the funds by types of securities held is given in Table 13. A listing of the individual investments held in the various endowment funds at June 30, 1974, may be obtained upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution.
Accounting and Auditing
The Private Trust Funds of the Institution, as well as the accounts of Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., the Smithsonian Research Foundation, and Reading-Is-Fundamental, Inc., are audited annually by independent public accountants. Their report for fiscal year 1974 on the Smithsonian is contained in the following pages, including a comparative balance sheet and a statement of changes in the various fund balances. Extensive changes in accounting treatment of a number of items in accordance with new guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants have been referred to at length in the Notes to these statements and are reflected in the tables in this report dealing with Unrestricted and Restricted Private Funds.
The Defense Contract Audit Agency annually performs an audit on granfand contract monies received from federal agencies. In addition, the federally appropriated funds of the Institution are subject to audit by the General Accounting Office. The internal audit staff continues to conduct audits throughout the wide range of Smithsonian activities and contributes greatly to smooth administrative and financial management.

The Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution:
We have examined the balance sheet of the Private Funds of Smithsonian Institution as of June 30, 1974 and the related statement of changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, nor other departments, bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under Federal appropriations as detailed in note 3 to the financial statements. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Private Funds of Smithsonian Institution at June 30, 1974 and the changes in its fund balances for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which, except for the changes referred to in note la to the financial statements, with which we concur, have been applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION — PRIVATE FUNDS Notes to Financial Statements
June 30, 1974
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a. Accrual Basis — The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution have
been prepared on the accrual basis, except for depreciation accounting as explained in note 1g below, and are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles included in the recently issued American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit Guide “Audits of Colleges and Universities”. In accordance with the requirements of the Guide, annual leave and interest income on endowment and similar fund investments have been accrued at June 30, 1974 and, in addition, certain changes in financial statement classification have been adopted. The effect of such changes in
classifications on beginning fund balances is as follows:
Current funds
Endowment and similar funds
Quasi-
Unrestricted Restricted Endowment endowment
Balance at June 30, 1973 as previously reported
Reclassify fund restricted for construction and acquisition of real estate
Reclassify funds that are internally restricted by the Institution
Net assets transferred to plant fund
Reclassify miscellaneous funds to agency status
Reclassify endowments

Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for provisions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers to the plant fund. .
b. Fund Accounting —In order to ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the prin-
52 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 67>>>

ciples of “fund accounting”. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to specific purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its institutional purposes.
Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.
Unrestricted quasi-endowment funds have been established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, receivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.
All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted resources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.
. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition when acquired by gift.
. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.
. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution’s magazine and associates’ activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the applicable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current unrestricted funds.
. Endowment and Similar Fund Investments — The Institution utilizes the “total return’ approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide 442% of the five year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of the assets of any fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received.

Smithsonian Year 1974
THE PAST YEAR in Science was characterized by a steady progress toward the goals outlined at the first institutional priorities conference at Belmont in 1973. In addition, efforts were directed to reappraising and redefining certain management structures in order to find new and better methods to build on to traditional strengths. This effort is in line with the discussions resulting from the Institution’s second priorities conference last February.
The Museum of Natural History focused attention this past year on its educational role, exploring new avenues to enrich the visitors’ experience. The formation of an in-house exhibits committee was a first step in the Museum’s desire to seek new directions in exhibitry. The opening of the Touch Exhibit focused the public’s attention on alternate methods to the traditional museum experience.
The National Zoological Park obtained a permit to the former Army Remount Station at Front Royal, Virginia, for use as a breeding farm, especially for endangered species. The new facility, it is hoped, will allow for increased propagation of rare animals, away from the limited space of Rock Creek Park.
Early in the fiscal year, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory joined with the Harvard College Observatory to form the Center for Astrophysics. The new arrangement has led to more flexibility in personnel and programs, increasing joint resources for maximum use.
The Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies continued to progress toward a goal of increased educational opportunities for neighboring schools and disadvantaged urban youth. A new building, which will house the educational and visitor orientation activities, was planned and bids were received for the work. The new

<<<Page: 72>>>

building will release office and lab space now jointly used for research and educational activities. Another program undertaken was the Information Transfer Program which translates scientific results into forms that can be useful to planners and government officials. Money for this program was made available from the Edward John Noble Foundation.
The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (str1) underwent a change of directorship this past year with the return of Dr. Martin Moynihan to his research as Senior Scientist at str1. He was succeeded by Dr. Ira Rubinoff, who previously served as Assistant Director at the facility. The research undertaken at stRI continued to be primarily concerned with basic scientific questions of the evolutionary and ecological adaptations of tropical organisms. An increased education program was undertaken with grants received from the Henry L. and Grace Doherty and Edward John Noble foundations.
The National Air and Space Museum’s new building continued on schedule and within the budget began to rise and take form on the Mall this past year with much of the staff’s time being spent on the preparation of exhibits that will be displayed in the new quarters. The formation of the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in the Museum provides the basis for a scientific research arm in lunar studies.
The Office of International and Environmental Programs was established this past year combining the Offices of International Activities and Environmental Sciences. The new Office is designed to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to conduct research abroad in its traditional strengths in collection-based natural history to the comparatively new area of environmental studies. Wymberley Coerr, a career foreign service officer who served as Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay, was appointed to head the Office.
In the past year, Smithsonian support of conservation in the Galapagos Islands has increased substantially in response to a significant rise in the number of contributions earmarked for Galapagos work. Aided by the Research Station’s new director, Craig MacFarland, administration and equipment have been markedly strengthened, and research expanded to include a marine biological survey, to help determine the limits of the National Park. In addition, two Smith-
58 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 73>>>

sonian research teams have recently visited the islands, one to continue studies of volcanic activity of Isla Fernandina and the other to begin a study of finches and orb-weaving arachnids. Educational programs in the islands were augmented by the Smithsonian helping to fund a volunteer from the Catholic Institute for International Relations, who is teaching biology, natural history, and conservation as well as aiding in the marine survey. Additionally, a SI-Peace Corps volunteer is working on the design of exhibits to the new Van-Straelen musuem/lecture hall, which will provide natural history instruction for both tourists and Galapaguefios.
The Smithsonian once again played a significant role in national and international affairs. Smithsonian scientists and administrators provided representatives and advisory services to the Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of the Interior, the Institute of Ecology, the First International Congress of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology, the Asia Society, the Bahamas National Trust, and the World Wildlife Fund. The staff has traveled to diverse places in the United States and abroad including the Bahamas, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, India, and Nepal. Smithsonian scientists continued their fruitful collaboration with foreign institutions on every continent and provided technical assistance on environmental programs.
Details of these concerns and scientific accomplishments in other areas of research by the individual bureaus, in fiscal year 1974, follow.
Center for the Study of Man
Over the past year the Center for the Study of Man has expanded and sharpened its research activities in the human sciences. From August 26 to September 2, 1973, three conferences organized by the Center were held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Two more conferences were held during the same period at Chicago, Illinois. Immediately following these meetings each of the conferences reported its findings to the assembled attendees at the IXth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences meeting in Chicago, Illinois, from September 3 to 10. The 5 sessions organized by the
Science / 59

<<<Page: 74>>>

Center for the Study of Man were: (1) cross-cultural uses of can| nibus; (2) cross-cultural uses of alcohol; (3) examination of a gen| eral theory of cultural transmission; (4) cultural consequences of | population change; and (5) economic development in seven selected | American Indian groups. Each of these research projects was an out| come of the Center’s program to relate anthropology and the human | sciences to modern worldwide problems. All reports are now in one | or another stage of preparation for publication. |
Specifically, the cannibus report is in press, and it constitutes the | first well-documented report of cannibus usage on a worldwide | basis. The coverage is not complete, but it constitutes a beginning | and lays the groundwork for an accelerated growth of knowledge | in the immediate future. The papers in the alcohol volume, also in } press, testify to the increasing worldwide sophistication of human } scientists about alcohol usage and its perception in cultures around | the world. The general theory of cultural transmission considers | education as a special case. Because Western-style formal education is so pervasive, it is especially important to learn more about other | perspectives on cultural transmission. The results of the conference on population are in press, but the project is not yet complete. A | number of participants from developing countries met in Bucharest, Rumania, in August to go over papers that have come out of the | Oshkosh and Chicago meetings. The American Indian economic de| velopment study is in press and should appear within a year.
Manuscripts for the forthcoming encyclopedic Handbook of North American Indians continue to arrive daily. The editorial office, with the assistance of volume editors in various parts of the country, is editing these works for publication in 1976.
The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies, under the direction of Dr. Roy Bryce-Laporte, has been supervising research in Costa Rica and Panama. In particular, it has focused on the | West Indian adaptation and experience in both of these countries. It has also been reviewing policy implications of migration and | some contemporary perspectives on alienation. |
In June 1974, a National Anthropological Film Center was estab| lished within the Center for the Study of Man. It is charged with the | preservation and study of visual information on vanishing and | changing ways of life. )

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies
The three programs of the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies — scientific research, information transfer, and environmental education — were marked by expansion and innovation during 1974.
At the 2500-acre Center near Annapolis, a long-term study of the Rhode River watershed continues with NsF-RANN (National Science Foundation-Research Applied to National Needs) as the major source of funding. The current grant extends through September 1974 and was made through the Chesapeake Research Consortium, composed of the Smithsonian Institution, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
Thirteen nsE-funded projects are underway at the Center. They are part of the Consortium’s effort to determine the environmental impact of alternate levels of sewage effluent loading in specified parts of the Bay.
The Center’s contribution is to provide understanding of the biological functioning of an ecosystem and from this to devise methods for determining the impact of sewage effluent. Projects include investigations of the amount of groundwater and runoff in the Rhode River watershed, the circulation patterns of the estuary, and the water exchange with the Bay. Water samples collected at stations in the estuary are analyzed for chemical content.
Stream gauging wiers were constructed during the year to record the volume of water flowing from five subwatersheds and to take volume-integrated water samples. Scientists at the Center analyze these samples for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic carbon, and suspended sediment.
With the aid of computer printouts of aerial photographs, scientists are developing a key for identifying salt-marsh vegetation. Funding is provided through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as part of a remote sensing project underway at the Center since 1970. This year the Center began preparing land-use maps of the Rhode River watershed based on these photographs. The maps will be a valuable tool for a number of investigators and for agencies concerned with the environment.

Since the beginning of the fiscal year, college students, under the supervision of the Assistant Director, have conducted a survey of the recreational use of the Rhode River.
Two staff members are studying the mammals of Poplar, Coaches, and Jefferson Islands. Owned by the Smithsonian and administered by the Center, these islands off Talbot County on Maryland’s Eastern Shore are eroding at different rates and offer an unusual opportunity to study the effect on mammal populations of rapidly diminishing habitats in a closed system.
Among the Center’s continuing studies is “Population Dynamics in Breeding Birds,” begun in 1968 and projected for a 20-year period. Objectives include the determination of species succession resulting from successful changes in vegetation.
Funded with a grant from the Edward John Noble Foundation, the Information Transfer Program has as its goal the translation of scientific results into forms which can be used by planners, government officials, and resource managers who make decisions that affect the Bay. In addition, the program makes environmental information available to organizations and individuals.
Projects undertaken this year include a survey of environmental organizations in the Chesapeake Bay area. An environmental information specialist sought to determine the issues that most concern these organizations and the extent of their contacts with State officials and legislators. She also evaluated the effectiveness of the organizations and interviewed scientists to find out what lines of communication exist between them and the general public.
The Center co-sponsored with the Anne Arundel County Chapter of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation preliminary meetings which resulted in the formation of the South County Citizens League, composed of representatives of citizens associations. The purpose is to unite organizations and individuals in the intelligent examination of probable future issues in order to influence public policies and action.
An all-day workshop on environmental problems was arranged for the Maryland League of Women Voters and attended by representatives of a number of organizations and agencies.

The Rhode Worker, added to the Chesapeake Bay Center’s fleet during the year, is used for projects related to the NSF-funded Rhode River Research Program. One of these projects is “Nutrient Studies on the Rhode River Ecosystem,” in which samples from 13 stations in a freshwater creek and the estuary are tested for 16 qualities, either at the collection site or in the laboratory below.

<<<Page: 78>>>

A description of the Center’s tours and programs was distributed in the area, facilitating scheduling and resulting in an increased number of requests for this service.
The Center chartered a bus through a nonprofit line sponsored by the Community Action Agency and arranged to bring a different group of sixth graders from five local schools to the Center each week for “The Living Community,” a project that stresses the interrelationship of living things. Before each visit, a staff member made a preparatory presentation in the classroom.
The Rhode River Environmental Education Project, one of the Center’s most ambitious educational efforts, got underway in the fall of 1973 after a successful pilot program. With the cooperation of the ymca of Metropolitan Washington, a different group of tenth graders from 16 District of Columbia schools resided for four days at a YMCA camp adjoining the Center. The students used the Center for field work, and college students served as counsellors. The curriculum, designed by the Assistant Director and an Education Specialist, focused on man’s relationship to his environment.
The Summer Ecology Program, an intensive course for school children from the elementary grades through high school, was initiated in the summer of 1973 and will continue in 1974. College students who plan to teach the natural sciences instruct the children. The program provides the instructors with teaching experience and the children with an enriching supplement to their school work.
The Center arranged an all-day workshop for science teachers from all over the country who were enrolled in a summer institute sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Similar workshops are planned for the summer of 1974.
Continuing education activities include opportunities for college students to work with staff scientists on specific projects and providing speakers for schools, colleges, and organizations.
The Center’s full-time staff numbered approximately 40 at the close of the fiscal year. Among the additions were Dr. Barbara Rice, Research Specialist with the Remote Sensing Project; Dr. Maria Faust, Biologist; Dr. Tung Lin Wu, Chemist; Dr. John Falk, Educa-

tion Coordinator; Marjorie Beane, Environmental Information Specialist; and Lynne Mormann, Education Specialist.
Some 40 additional researchers are actively engaged in projects at the Chesapeake Bay Center, including principal investigators for the Rhode River Research Program from the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland.
FACILITIES Ground was broken in the spring for a combined Visitor Center and Education Building scheduled for completion in the fall. This will be the first new structure to be built at the Center since its establishment in 1965.
The Center procured seven house trailers to alleviate a shortage of space for offices, laboratories, and dormitory facilities.
A 28-foot fiberglass cabin cruiser, the Rhode Worker was added to the Center’s fleet. Purchased with funds from the NsF-RANN grant, this boat is used for projects included in the Rhode River Research Program. Five other boats, including the 46-foot Java, are docked at the Center’s pier.
Fort Pierce Bureau
The primary research emphasis by the Fort Pierce Bureau this year is the Indian River Study, a consortium effort initiated in September of 1973, with a grant from the Atlantic Foundation. The Smithsonian’s 130-foot-floating-laboratory barge is the focal point for the Study, the chief aims of which are to obtain baseline information on the diversity of organisms and quality of their environment, sources of pollution and their effects on organisms, and a predictive capability of both shortand long-term effects on man-induced changes. To date, over 500 sampling stations have been occupied on 22 offshore cruises by the RV Gosnold, 10 cruises have been made in the Indian River lagoon on a specially modified houseboat research vessel to make in situ environmental measurements, and fish and benthic samples have been repetitively collected at 36 stations and 4 transects within the Indian River.
Life-history studies of marine animals have continued through the second year with stress on reproductive biology, developmental patterns, and larval development of unsegmented marine worms of

the phylum Sipuncula. More than 20 larval sipunculans of unknown species have been collected from the Gulf Stream off Fort Pierce, Florida; these have been raised in the laboratory and studies made of their morphology by use of scanning electron microscopy and histological procedures. Developmental patterns emerging from this work promise to have important implications for and understanding of the interphyletic and intraphyletic relationships of these organisms.
The former Coast Guard cutter, Hopley Yeaton, was christened officially the RV Johnson on Saturday, January 26, 1974, by Mrs. J. Seward Johnson during an open-house celebration at Link Port, Florida. An estimated 1500 visitors attended the ceremony to view the Bureau’s 125-foot vessel, a tender to the research submarine Johnson-Sea-Link, which can be launched and recovered rapidly by a hydraulic crane located at the aft end of the ship. The “mother ship’-submersible-lockout diver system will be used on missions this coming year to explore, photograph, and sample the continental shelf adjacent to the Indian River.
Since the unfortunate entrapment of the Johnson-Sea-Link off the Florida Keys in June 1973, considerable effort has been devoted at Link Port to developing rescue systems for small research submarines and to modifying several safety and life-support systems on the Johnson-Sea-Link. A surface rescue craft, under construction,
will support a cable-controlled unmanned submersible equipped —
with television and manipulator that can free an entrapped object from a depth in excess of 1000 feet. A second submarine, JohnsonSea-Link II, should be finished by the end of 1974 —a sister submersible with lockout capability can be viewed as an excellent rescue mechanism. Already implemented on the Johnson-Sea-Link are an improved high-capacity and high-volume carbon-dioxide scrubber, remote read-out gauges in the pilot’s sphere for carbon dioxide and oxygen sensing and monitoring instruments employed in the diving compartment, and redesigned attachment points for handling lines, which employ the break-away concept and eliminate hooks. During the past several months, two successful cruises have been completed to the Bahamas to train the respective crews of the support ship RV Johnson and submarine Johnson-Sea-Link as a total system, to launch and recover the submersible from anchor or underway and in a sea state of Beaufort Force 5, to complete training of two qualified submarine pilots, and to perform shallow submarine

and lockout operations under day and night conditions. This conscientious training program, incorporating all aspects of submersible operations, diving and support-equipment handling under the able management of an Operations Director, is the most effective procedure of reducing the accepted level of risk involved in submarine work.
National Air and Space Museum
The progress made in building construction, exhibits, staffing, and research in 1974 leaves little doubt that the National Air and Space Museum is fast becoming one of the most important and exciting bureaus of the Institution.
The construction of the new museum building, which is on schedule, is almost 50 percent complete. The contracts for structural steel and metal decks have been closed out. The marble contract is 65 percent complete. Glass curtain walls and skylights are being installed. By the end of summer, the building will be completely enclosed, which will permit interior work without regard to the elements. As originally forecast, the staff will move into the building in the summer of 1975 and the building will open in July 1976.
The building will contain 25 major exhibition halls and 2 presentation centers; the development of exhibits for these halls has been — the major thrust of the museum during 1974 and will continue to be through 1976. The goal for the opening of the building is to have “core” quality exhibits in approximately 50 percent of the available | space with well-displayed objects in the remainder of the halls.
During 1974 the following major exhibits were completed:
“Air Traffic Control’ — an exhibit which explains the complex | equipment and competent personnel who perform behind the scenes | in our air traffic network.
“Exhibition Flight’ — this exhibit tells the story with artifacts, film, and photos of how exhibition flight caught the imagination of the American public and popularized flying.
“Life in the Universe” — this exhibit examines the birth and death of stars and galaxies; the nature of life and its chemical building blocks; the tools being used to find life; how this life may have evolved, what forms it may have taken, and how we might communicate with it.

In addition to the major exhibits, the following special exhibits were mounted in 1974:
“Copernicus” — prototype telescope of nasa’s Orbiting Astronomical Observatory during the 500th anniversary of Copernicus, the father of modern astronomy.
“Skylab” — America’s first experimental space station.
“Aerobatics” — featuring the U.S. World Championship Aerobatics team and one of their aircraft, the Pitts Special.
“Santos-Dumont”’ — observing the centenary of the birth of this pioneer aircraft designer, aeronaut, aviator, and astronomer.
“Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel’ — exhibiting on the 70th anniversary of powered heavier-than-air flight a replica of the wind tunnel with daily demonstrations of its use as a precursor to the first powered flight.
“Space and Artists’” — continuing displays of paintings of space and aviation art.
“First World Flight’ — traces the first round-the-world flight through photographs and drawings superimposed over a map of the route taken by the pilots in 1924. During the 6-month circumnavigation of the world, the crews endured hardships of extreme cold and heat, accidents, and mechanical failures. The flagplane, Chicago, was completely restored by the NAsM and is the centerpiece of the exhibit, in the rotunda of the Arts and Industries Building.
Fiscal year 1974 brought the beginning of a formal program of research to the museum. A Department of Science and Technology was created and staffed with two senior personnel. The implementation of the nas Science and Technology research program has begun with an analysis of the history and validity of design criteria in use in the air and space industry. A Center for Earth and Planetary Studies was established under the leadership of one of the foremost lunar geologists in the world. At the same time, Nasa’s comprehensive lunar scientific photograph collection and records were transferred to the museum. The Center has already published several scientific articles. In cooperation with Nasa, a lunar mapping program is ongoing. Moreover, the Center Director occupies one of seven seats on the International Astronautical Union (1av) Task Group on Lunar Nomenclature.
Exhibits-related research is-a major NASM activity with the various curatorial departments performing artifact documentary research,

prerestoration curatorial research, and historical research. The NAsm Exhibits Division is developing several research programs concerned with the reliability of exhibits components, new exhibits techniques, novel film transport systems, etc.
The large size of today’s flying machines, coupled with an ever accelerating pace of aerospace technology, results in tremendous pressure on curators to increase the size of their collections. At the same time, however, the available storage space is not increasing at the same pace. Therefore, in January 1974, an Acquisition Policy Statement was issued for use by the curatorial staff of the NAsM. Briefly, the policy indicates that each major addition to the collection should be balanced, wherever possible, by an equivalent deletion or loan. It also places the responsibility for the final approval of the acquisitions of major new artifacts with the Director of the museum. Prior to 1974, the curatorial staff approved acquisitions and the Director approved loans. This policy has now been reversed.
At the time the acquisition policy was enacted, the museum began an all-out effort to review and, where possible, dispose of surplus artifacts, particularly engines, archival material, aircraft models, aircraft, and space material. To date:
1. Fifty engines have been transferred or loaned.
2. Approximately 12,000 cubic feet of miscellaneous material, including books, periodicals, photographs, records, and other documents have been declared surplus or duplicate material and transferred to other institutions. This included over 3,500 periodicals.
3. A complete inventory of the model aircraft collection (numbering over 1,000 models) is under way. The information will be computerized so that the collection can be studied from various criteria such as scale, aircraft type, condition, etc.
4. Twenty-eight astronautic artifacts have been deaccessioned and disposed of.
During fiscal 1974, the Presentations and Education Division was organized with responsibility for developing and implementing three programs: the education program of the museum, Spacearium programs, and programs for the nasM Theater.
The education program includes lectures, tours, and other activities to assist individuals and groups in using the museum, its resources, and publications for effective learning about air and space and related subject matter. In fiscal 1974, 168 tours were conducted by 13 docents and volunteers for over 5000 students.

During fiscal 1974, a small planetarium began an ongoing operation in the Air and Space Building as an experimental laboratory to prepare for the larger Spacearium. Programs were given to general visitors and to a few visiting school classes, and special classes were conducted in this facility for the Smithsonian Associates.
Two pilot programs were initiated in fiscal 1974 at the Silver Hill facility. The first was an adult night class for those who might build and fly their own airplanes, and emphasized safe and rational design, engineering, and maintenance. The second program was designed to teach inner-city children the basic skills required to build and maintain aircraft, including welding, sheet metal and fabric work, engine overhaul, etc. Both programs were well received and will be expanded in the future.
For the second year the museum, in conjunction with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, hosted an astronomy lecture series. While the first series in 1972 attempted to assess man’s current knowledge of the solar system as seen from the planet Earth, the second series, “Beyond the Planets,” surveyed our Galaxy and the Universe from the vantage point of the Sun. The series, consisting of eight lectures by some of America’s outstanding astronomers, was received with enthusiasm by standing-room-only crowds.
As a special event, the museum sponsored a poetry reading and discussion by Apollo 15 Astronaut Alfred Worden. Astronaut Worden was warmly received as he read selections from his book of poems, Hello Earth, Greetings From Endeavor, and discussed his feelings and emotions that prompted him to compose each of the poems. The readings were illustrated by color panoramas made during Apollo 15’s epic journey to the Moon.

National Museum of Natural History
There was a bustle of activity on the Museum’s first floor in early 1974 as carpenters, scientists, designers, and other Museum craftsmen worked to complete “Ice Age Mammals and the Emergence of Man,” the first of a series of new exhibits that will enrich considerably the Museum’s educational impact. Long-range plans call for the overhaul and rejuvenation of one permanent exhibit hall every year through 1979. All of these new halls will be thematically structured to convey clearly to the public concepts of evolution that are fundamental to an understanding of the natural world.
To accomplish this change the Museum has departed from its traditional practice of building an exhibit hall around a single departmental discipline. The Ice Age Hall formerly housed a paleontological exhibit devoted to Pleistocene mammals. Its replacement is multidisciplinary, blending objects from the paleontology, mineral science, and anthropology collections, into a thematic context that describes the great physical and biological events of the Ice Age, including the development of the continental glaciers, the evolution of large mammals, the extinction of many of them, and the arrival of man.
The new multidisciplinary thematic exhibits that are in the process of design and production are the result of an entirely new approach to exhibits at the Museum. An advisory committee of Museum scientists, headed by Dr. Leo J. Hickey, has been set up as a liaison between the Museum’s professional staff and its exhibits office, directed by Harry T. Hart. A close working relationship has been established that is responsible for the excellence of the new Ice Age Hall and the promise of the Museum’s Bicentennial exhibit, “Our Changing Land.”
“Our Changing Land,” now under development, will chronicle environmental change in the Washington, D.C., area since the arrival of man, stressing what has happened since the founding of the Nation, and explaining the main ecological processes related to the change and what options there may be for the future. The ground floor of the north wing is being prepared for this exhibit.
In addition to renewal of permanent halls and the development of the Bicentennial exhibit, a variety of other exhibit events made 1974 at the Museum an extraordinarily active and vigorous year.

Curious children and adults were crowding into the Museum’s recently opened Discovery Room where they were urged to keep their hands on and not off the exhibits. Elephant tusks, coral, petrified wood, wooly mammoth teeth, and hundreds of other natural history specimens, ordinarily out of reach behind glass or railings in museums, could be grasped, turned over in the hand at one’s leisure, and studied with a magnifying glass. If requested, one of the room’s docents would make available books and film loops to help take a person farther down the path of discovery. The room added a permanent new dimension to the Museum’s offerings.

plastic, after sketches and photographs taken in the Panama and South American jungles, the exhibit’s trees, foliage, and vines were enclosed in a mirrored ceiling-high silo. Walking into this dimly lit enclosure, visitors had the illusion that they were in the center of a vast tropical forest — with trees rising 80-100 feet above their heads. This simulated forest was the heart of a larger ecological exhibit, “Tt All Depends,” which made the point that all elements in the environment are dependent upon each other for survival.
Looking alertly out from an “arctic ice floe” in the west end of the Life in the Sea Hall was an imposing new Museum presence, a mounted specimen of that largest of the fin-footed aquatic animals — the sea walrus. Beneath its icy perch a visitor could see an informative film about it and other pinnipeds, a family of mammals that besides the walrus includes the seal and the sea lion. In a narration inspired by the Lewis Carroll verse, ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter,” actor Cyril Ritchard could be heard addressing a pinniped, “I would like to talk to you, about how you live, where you live and the things you like to do.”
The Museum once again made clear its opposition to the unlimited killing of members of that other great family of sea mammals,

the cetaceans, to which belong the porpoises, dolphins, and whales. In May and June it was host to an exhibition organized by Project Jonah’s International Children’s Campaign to Save the Whales. Drawings by elementary school children from the District of Columbia and its suburbs protesting the killing of whales were hung side-by-side with works by young artists from other cities in America and foreign countries.
Two other colorful and notable exhibits in the Museum’s foyer area were the offshoot of the field research trips of two of the Museum’s scientists. One was a display of large, dye-transfer color prints of tropical blossoms photographed in Africa and South America by Dr. Edward S. Ayensu, Chairman of the Museum’s Department of Botany (supplemented with pictures by the Museum’s scientific photographer, Kjell B. Sandved), the other placed on view ethnological materials from the eastern Himalayan country of Bhutan, collected by Dr. Eugene I. Knez, the Museum’s Curator of Asian Anthropology. This exhibit was planned to coincide with the June coronation of Bhutan’s 19-year-old king, and included the display of photographs, paintings, textiles, costumes, copper, gold and silver vessels, religious objects, basketry, and pottery.

the lenders to the exhibit was Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, who has made several expeditions to Bhutan.
Two Museum physical anthropologists, Drs. J. Lawrence Angel and Douglas H. Ubelaker, in separate paleodemographic studies in the Old and New Worlds, are amassing evidence of how environmental conditions influenced the health, longevity, and evolution of prehistoric man.
Working closely with archeologists who have unearthed grave sites, the two scientists make measurements of ancient skeletal material. From this they can assemble a body of statistics about an ancient community that includes the size of its population, the age composition, birth rate, sex ratio, number of children born, family size, and critical effects of diseases such as arthritis and malaria — all of which are determined by diet, climate, living habits, and heredity.
Dr. Angel’s work over the last decade has been concentrated on Eastern Mediterranean burial sites such as Catal Hiiyiik, Turkey, where a population of early neolithic hunting farmers and traders, living in a compact pueblo-like community, had conquered the peril of a high child mortality rate — probably caused by malaria — by evolving a culture that venerated and protected women. This had lengthened the lives and childbearing years of the women. The population of the community had increased as a result, and it had become possible for the women to make a rich contribution to the community’s art, crafts, and religious activities, while the men were hunting and trading.
The People of Lerna: An Analysis of a Prehistoric Aegean Population, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press, is Dr. Angel’s study of a site situated on the Bay of Argos, Greece, where archeologists found 235 Bronze Age graves, covering a span of 25 generations (2000-1600 B.c.).
The demographic profile Dr. Angel constructed showed that adults in Lerna (which he estimated had about 800 persons living in it during the Middle Bronze Age) had an average life expectancy of 34 years — 37 for men, 31 for women. The average woman bore about five children — 2.2 of which grew to adulthood (15 years of age). On the basis of that birth rate the population was increasing, doubling every 7 to 10 generations. This was a remarkably successful adaptation to the handicapping diseases afflicting the community.

Malaria, in particular, had a crippling impact, just as it had had at Catal Hiiyiik. The changeover from a hunting to a farming culture, which had begun in the Mediterranean between 9000 to 6500 B.c. with the disappearance of the big game herds, had drawn early farming populations to sites like Lerna where the soil was soft and the forests not established. But these well-watered marshy areas that favored farming also favored the Anopheles mosquito and the result was that malaria, especially the type known as falciparum malaria, was rampant. The physical debilitation caused by this disease

<<<Page: 96>>>

plagued and weakened Lerna for most of its prehistoric period (the average stature of the Lerna men was only 5’ 542” and women, 5’ 14”). It was not until later when Greek communities learned how to drain their marshes to gain better control of irrigation and water supply that the numbers of malaria-carrying mosquitos were reduced, a development reflected in the stature and longevity of the people.
Dr. Angel’s colleague, Douglas Ubelaker, has been analyzing skeletal material from a large pre-Columbian cemetery in the Hacienda Ayalan, Guayas Province, on the south coast of Ecuador, dating to A.D. 1300, where 50 large ceramic urns, each containing up to 20 skeletons, were uncovered.
With the approval of the Ecuadorian Government all of this material was shipped back to the Museum, where now, highly accurate microscopic methods of determining age by osteon counts were conducted. The results were startling. The population had an average adult age at death of about 67 years, with many individuals living into the eighth and ninth decade, a much higher figure than one would expect for a prehistoric population.
It can be explained by the fact the site provided excellent nutrition. The people took crops from the land and exploited freshand saltwater food resources. Many of the diseases that historically lower life expectancy (syphilis, malaria, measles, mumps, smallpox) either were nonexistent or were not severe problems until the Spanish arrived. Furthermore, there is some evidence of remarkable contemporary longevity along that part of the coast that may have extended back into prehistory.
Stands of Japanese Ma-dake timber bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) are flowering throughout America, a cyclical phenomenon that takes place only at intervals of 120 years and is as rare to botanists as Halley’s comet is to astronomers. Drs. Thomas R. Soderstrom and C. E. Calderén, Museum scientists, have been monitoring this dramatic botanical event. Last year they asked for help from readers of Smithsonian magazine and the Smithsonian’s Environmental Alert Network, which alerted high school science classes all over the country. Hundreds of persons, young and old, responded by mailing in dried specimens of flowering branches of the bamboo plant and along with it information about precisely where it was collected and photographs and short histories of the

stands from which it came. With these data, Drs. Soderstrom and Calderon were able to draw up a map that pinpoints Ma-dake stands in at least 22 states, showing its heaviest concentrations on the West Coast, from Washington to California, and in the southeastern Gulf states.
Science / 83

<<<Page: 98>>>

The flowering of Ma-dake is always followed by the death of the plant’s culms (stems), and this was verified by the volunteer observers. In cases where the flowering and death cycle had taken place in the late 1960s, they noticed that the old rhizomes (underground stem masses) were regenerating themselves and producing many new but weak, contorted shoots. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderon point out that it may take 6 or more years before large, normal shoots are again grown, and perhaps 15 years before the bamboo clump is in the same condition prior to flowering. In Japan Ma-dake is used as a raw material for the construction of homes, furniture, farm implements, baskets, and even food, and it is easy to understand why the cyclical flowering there is considered nothing less than a disaster.
All of the Ma-dake stands do not flower simultaneously because there are a number of time-oriented, hereditary lines, consisting of segregated progeny, distributed throughout the world. Each of these hereditary lines is on a 120-year cycle. These cycles began to come to completion in the late 1950s, but most of them in America have done so in the late 1960s. Drs. Soderstrom and Calderén predict that the present flowering will end shortly, but will begin again in the 2070s, continue through the 2080s, and terminate in the 2090s.
The covered jars in Dr. Donald R. Davis’s laboratory are full of blotched and discolored leaves on which one can see curious lines. Some of the lines are crooked, some are coiled in a serpentine manner, and others strike out in every direction from a central patch, creating a star-shaped pattern. The leaves were collected by Dr. Davis from the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, but they could just as well be from almost any garden, park, or forest in America. The marks on the leaves are the work of leaf miners, insect larvae of minute size that can infest every leaf of a plant or tree and do enough aggregate damage to kill their host. In Canada, the miners have been so destructive to spruce and fir trees in the Western Provinces in the last few years that the Government has initiated a biological study of these insects in hopes of finding a means of control.
Last year, Dr. Davis, Curator at the Museum’s Department of Entomology, began work on a biosystematic study directed specifically at four important families of leaf-mining Microlepidoptera (Eriocraniidae, Nepticulidae, Heliozelidae, and Gracillariidea).

Mining behavior of almost every description, ranging from the most highly specialized to some of the most primitive forms, is practiced within these four groups.
One of the things Dr. Davis wants to do through his study of these families is to trace the evolutionary history of mining. Recently, Dr. Leo J. Hickey, a Museum paleobotanist, found a Nepticulid leaf mine on a lower Cretaceous Angiosperm leaf, a discovery that extends this basic ecological association between plants and insects back nearly 110 million years. Dr. Davis is now examining the Smithsonian-U.S. Geological Survey collection of Cretaceous and early Tertiary Angiosperms for further evidence of early Lepidoptera leaf-mining injury.
The mined leaves that Dr. Davis collects on trips to habitats like the Great Dismal Swamp and the Great Smoky Mountains are brought back to his Museum laboratory so that the miner larvae can be reared, identified, and closely observed. Dr. Davis plans studies of all phases of their life cycle, including oviposition, larval development, mine morphology, pupation, and adult behavior. He is also interested in correlating the systematics and behavior of the moths with that of their plant hosts. Why does a particular species of miner often only feed on a particular species of plant?
But before such intriguing biological questions can be seriously studied, basic taxonomic revisions must be prepared. Much of the classification of the four families was done in the nineteenth century, an age when moth investigators described the color and venation of wings — but little else. The skeleton, which is now recognized as the best part of the insect on which to base a taxonomic diagnosis, was often ignored. Dr. Davis has had to start out by eliminating the confusion this has created. He is now assembling comprehensive illustrated texts to facilitate rapid, accurate identification for the approximately 365 presently recognized North American species and the more than 100 new species that have come to light in his studies.
What will happen if the sea-level canal the U.S. Government has proposed constructing sometime in the future across the Isthmus of Panama mixes the animal and plant groups of the Atlantic and Pacific sides? Scientists say that serious ecological disruptions could follow. Dr. Meredith L. Jones, Curator of Worms in the Museum’s Department of Invertebrate Zoology, saw several years ago that the lack of fundamental knowledge about the communities of marine
86 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 101>>>

animals that live in the shallow waters on both sides of the isthmus would make it extremely difficult to assess the nature of these disruptions after they occur. Well-documented collections were needed to provide a benchmark for future investigations. To assemble these, Dr. Jones organized the Museum’s Panama Biota Program.
The original qualitative collecting method involved hand-picking the organisms from the surface of a sieve that had been used to process an undetermined amount of sediment. Dr. Jones and his colleagues devised a quantitative method that they are now using to get true samples of the density and diversity of invertebrate organisms living in Panama’s coastal waters. Collections are made while the tide is still high. Standing in water that is anywhere from ankle to waist deep, the scientists drive a cubical stainless steel jacket, that has an area of 1/20 of a square meter, 8 inches down into the mud. Then they slide a shovel under the jacket, draw it out of the bottom, sieve the sample, and bottle all of the residue. In typical samples taken the new way, the yields comprised an average of about 1800 specimens per square meter on a clean sand beach on the Atlantic coast, about 6400 specimens per square meter on a muddy sand beach on the Pacific, and about 46,000 specimens per square meter in an Atlantic turtle-grass bed.
Five samples are usually taken at each collection station in order to insure that contrasting microenvironments within a habitat are represented. An effort has also been made to take samples at each station at every season of the year.
At the Museum, a technician-student has been making quantitative counts of invertebrate life forms in each sample, classifying the animals by families. There is such an abundance of life in each sample that processing it takes the technician six full days of work. When Dr. Jones examines the worms in a sample to identify them at a species level, six more days of work are involved. He estimates that it will take him three to four years to get through all of the samples that have been collected.
If a sea-level canal should be constructed, Dr. Jones is satisfied that now scientists will be able to go back to the same site, make new collections, and then make comparisons that will show them what is happening, and enable them to predict what will happen next and if it will be beneficial or harmful. If the sea-level canal is never constructed, Dr. Jones believes the Program is still well worthwhile.

It is accumulating collections of unique value in an area of tremendous biological interest.
The present Panama Canal with freshwater lakes situated midway along its length has proved a highly effective barrier to the passage of marine life from one side of Central America to the other. So a scientist’s curiosity is aroused when a marine fish native to the Pacific shows up in the Caribbean. Dr. Victor G. Springer, Curator of Fishes in the Museum’s Department of Vertebrate Zoology, recently looked into the matter of a tropical Indo-West Pacific blenniid fish population living off Trinidad and the Atlantic entrance to the Canal. Was it a relic population that was once distributed throughout the world’s tropic waters or had it been artificially introduced, conceivably through the Canal?
The facts argued against its being a relic population. Members of the blenniid family speciate rapidly and no blenniid species is found in both the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans, which were last connected 2 to 4 million years ago. If the fish had once been widely distributed in the tropics, its Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean populations would have evolved into different species since the rise of the isthmus. Dr. Springer concluded that it must have been artificially introduced into the western Atlantic, probably by the discharge of ballast or bilge waters of ships. The fish is small and found in abundance around docks where it can easily be sucked into a ship’s ballast tanks. Other small marine fish have been picked up in this way, taken thousands of miles, released when the ship discharged its bilge waters, and established breeding populations. But this is the only instance of a fish being introduced in this way into the Caribbean.
Did the ships that brought the fish to the Caribbean enter through the Canal? Dr. Springer thinks not. Ships coming across the Pacific discharge their bilge-ballast water before they enter the Canal; that being the case, the fish should be established on the Pacific side of the Canal. But it has never been found there or anywhere else in the eastern Pacific, but it does occur at the Atlantic entrance to the Canal. Trinidad is where the fish has its principal Caribbean population and where it was first collected in the Atlantic in 1930. Dr. Springer believes that instead of coming across the Pacific, the fish arrived in Trinidad from the Indo-West Pacific via the Atlantic before the Canal was first opened in 1914.

The trail led Dr. Springer to the East Indian coolie trade that flourished between Calcutta and Madras, on the east coast of India, and the West Indies islands in the years from 1838 to 1914 and 1917. In that period, thousands of coolies arrived on ships that traveled from India to the Caribbean around southern Africa. It is Dr. Springer’s view that the coolie trade vessels were the vehicles that introduced Omobranchus punctatus into the western Atlantic.
Garnet can be yellow, orange, red, lilac or purple, depending on its chemical composition and upon the temperature and pressure conditions under which it formed in the earth. It has long been known by scientists that this colorful mineral occurs in varying quantities in kimberlite pipes, the bodies of igneous rock that are the primary source of diamonds. But the fact that there was a high or low concentration of garnet in a pipe did not seem to indicate one way or the other if there was an abundance or dearth of diamonds present. Last year, however, Dr. George S. Switzer, Curator of Mineralogy in the Museum’s Department of Mineral Science, discovered that certain lilac-colored garnets have special compositional characteristics that make it possible to say that if they are present in a pipe, it is a diagnostic indication that diamonds are likely to be found there in economic quantities.
These garnets are formed — as diamonds are — in the earth’s upper mantle at a depth of 100-150 miles. When molten kimberlite forces its way to the surface at velocities estimated to be on the order of 300-400 feet per second, it sometimes brings both of these minerals up with it from the earth’s interior. The garnet is found in the pipes in rocks called xenoliths (eclogites and periodites) and sometimes in diamonds as minute inclusions. Because of its occurrence in diamonds, all of the garnet was thought by some scientists to have crystallized (reached equilibrium) at the same time, place, and temperature as the diamonds. Another school of thought, however, held that the garnets in kimberlite xenoliths crystallized at lower temperatures than garnet inside the diamond.
These two opposing views were tested by Dr. Switzer in a detailed study of the garnet in the Finsch kimberlite pipe, one of the richest diamond mines in South Africa. Finsch is also rich in garnet. It makes up 90 percent of the mineral concentrate recovered there during the diamond extraction process.
Dr. Switzer brought back to the Museum a handful of garnet

grains of all colors that had been recovered at Finsch in the extraction process. He sorted 300 of these on the basis of color into eight categories and analyzed them on the Department’s electron microprobe, which can identify and quantify the elements within each grain.
The results showed that some of the grains of lilac-colored garnets — magnesum rich and calcium poor — had a chromium content that placed them within the compositional field of the garnets previously only reported as inclusions in diamonds. Dr. Switzer, who is now testing garnets from other kimberlite pipes, believes that the presence of lilac-colored diamond of this special composition is diagnostic of the presence of diamond in a pipe, but it is not known yet _ if there is any quantitative relationship.

This emerging picture of geologic change includes Dr. Stanley’s! discovery of sedimentological evidence for the existence of a large emerged land mass present in the area now occupied by the Ligurian | Sea (between the Riviera and Corsica, in the western Mediterranean) until early Tertiary time. Seismic studies of the present Ligurian Sea floor, and examination of exposed sediments found in the French Maritime Alps, Corsica, and the northwestern Apennines of Italy, | confirm that this land mass foundered and became submerged after the Oligocene.

For this, Dr. Stanley depends upon his keen geologist’s eye and his skill as a mountain climber.
The publication in 1973 of the 765-page bilingual volume The Mediterranean Sea: A Natural Sedimentation Laboratory, edited by Dr. Stanley and Drs. Gilbert Kelling and Yehezkiel Weiler, was the result of Dr. Stanley’s determination to achieve a needed multi| disciplinary and multinational synthesis of current research in sedi| mentation and related fields in the Mediterranean and circumMediterranean. The book has contributions by 85 specialists from 15 countries, all of whom participated in a symposium organized by Dr. Stanley in 1971 at the VIII International Sedimentological Con— gress in Heidelberg. |
The book includes an outline of criteria for a needed international | effort to find out what happens to pollutants when they are intro| duced into the Mediterranean, where they go, and what their consequences are. It calls for the construction of monitoring stations to detect and map sediment and pollutant dispersal and depositation; aerial flights and space-satellite photography to monitor the discharge of sediments from river mouths, and rates of serious erosion along selected coastlines (such as the Nile Delta area affected by the Aswan Dam); and, finally, more deep-sea drilling to resolve additional questions of the Mediterranean’s geological and stratigraphic background.

National Zoological Park
The National Zoological Park is accelerating its change from cages for containment of species to open arenas for awareness of the relationship of all living things; from a consumer of animals out of the wild into a conservator and producer of animals and into a major zoological resource of animal knowledge that can be disseminated around the world.
In fiscal year 1974, the Zoo advanced efforts to establish new standards of excellence and responsibility in all areas of zoological park programs with concurrent courses of action:
Rebuilding yesterday’s zoo for tomorrow’s purpose.
Marshalling the most creative contributions of all staff members.
Launching necessary programs in off-site breeding and research.
Studying the relationships of animals to one another, to place and to time — and in time for survival.
Coordinating resources in forms that will reach people of all ages and walks of life.

<<<Page: 110>>>

Perhaps the Zoo’s most notable achievement since its founding in 1890 was receiving, in January 1974, a permit for 3200 acres of land in Front Royal, Virginia, that formerly served successively as a United States Army Remount Depot for horse breeding, and the United States Department of Agriculture as a Beef Cattle Experiment Station.
The acquisition of this propagation and research facility — to be known as the National Zoological Park’s Research and Conservation Center — will mark the end of the long search for a country facility which could be used to breed and maintain animal herds in sufficient numbers to insure their continuation as a viable, social, and genetic group. The educational mission of the National Zoological Park located in the valley of Rock Creek in Washington precludes the use of vast amounts of land for a single species so that it is not able to maintain ongoing herds of animals with proper age-pyramid and genetic mixture. Considering the worldwide shrinking of land areas available to wild animals, the increased hazards of disease, poaching, and land degradation by humans, the plight of many animals is indeed precarious. It is hoped that by establishing herds of threatened and endangered species at the Research and Conservation Center, insome cases through collaboration with other zoos in the United States, the Zoo will have a steady and reliable source of animals as well as a source for continuing zoological research on behalf of these species.
The development of the Research and Conservation Center will be deliberately paced, and future reports will carry information concerning its advancement. This year the Zoo was able to enclose 80 acres of rolling pasture for the first two resident groups of animals — Scimitar-horned Oryx and Pere David’s Deer.
The Front Royal Center will be an extension of the Rock Creek Park facility with major input in the first few years from the Offices of Animal Management, Animal Health, Zoological Research, Construction Management, and Facilities Management. Public information efforts at the Center focus now on the animal’s needs for isolation and space. Low-key programs in conservation, education, and natural viewing will be planned for coexistence with the principal mission in future years. When we speak of the National Zoological

The most interesting and exciting animal event was the birth of an Indian Rhinoceros in January, marking the first successful breeding of this endangered species in the Western Hemisphere. This achievement was the result of almost two years of concerted and integrated efforts by the scientific research staff, curators, keepers, and even volunteers who remained in the Zoo after hours to monitor the male’s and female’s activities during mating and later at birth. Therefore, the Zoo not only gained a 127-pound male (named Patrick in honor

a second-generation birth on her mother’s side to Nyandarua, Kan-
itia’s offspring of two years ago. Nyandarua was the first Bongo bred and born in captivity in the world.
The lesser pandas gave birth to their second pair of kits on the next to last day of the fiscal year so were not mentioned in last year’s report, and as if to catch us again, their pair from the year before provided the Zoo with young on the night of June 30, 1974.
The white-cheeked gibbon family produced a fine offspring to the delight of the staff and the visitors; and for the first time at the
National Zoological Park, the binturongs produced young, which
are being closely studied both for their growth and development as well as their behavioral relationship with the mother. The golden marmoset program continues to go well in terms of understanding the tie-in of behavior and reproduction. The Zoo now has 20 animals with birth this year of a first set of second-generation offspring as well as a set of twins from a wild-caught pair.
Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, the giant pandas, continue to thrive and hold the interest of the visiting public, behaving in their new yards rather like children released from school because of snow — rolling, somersaulting, playfully demolishing snowmen made for the occasion by the keepers. They are still unquestionably the most popular animals at the Zoo. Ling-Ling, the female, now weighs 250 pounds and Hsing-Hsing, the male, weighs 264 pounds. Studies on their behavior, vocalization, social relationships, and general habits are continuing with the assistance of volunteers from the Friends of the National Zoo to the scientific research staff and to the keeper and curatorial personnel. This April, Ling-Ling came into estrus, and we all had high hopes that there would be a breeding, particularly with the promising experiences of last year. However, although the animals got along well with the normal amount of premating, roughhouse play, vocalizations, and general juvenile nonsense, there was no actual breeding. No doubt this has been a further learning

experience for the male, but it appeared to be a frustrating experi-§ ence for the female. There are hopes for a breeding in the fall season, but if not then perhaps next spring when they are both older and wiser from their two encounters.
Despite the move of the white tigers (Mohini and Rewati) to Chicago’s Brookfield Zoo and the white-gene carrying Ramana and Kesari to the Cincinnati Zoo to allow replacement of the old Lion’ House, the latter pair added a new chapter to the breeding program! by producing four cubs, three of which are white. A normal-colored male, along with a white male were taken from the mother for handrearing and are doing well under the expert care of the Cincinnati staff, and the same can be said for the two, unsexed animals who remain with their mother, Kesari. Unfortunately, the sire Ramana passed away the week before with a chronic kidney condition, which is so often seen in the big cats between 10 or 12 years of age. These four new cubs give great hope for continuing the line of white tigers and should be a stellar attraction when the “Dr. William M. Mann Lion and Tiger Exhibit” is completed, hopefully in early 1976.
Among the outstanding bird hatchings can be counted the continuation of the Bornean Great Argus Pheasant breeding program with the successful raising of 12 of these young birds. Rivaling the success of this program was the raising of three Nene Geese for the : first time in the history of the Zoo. Other outstanding hatchings include three Stanley’s Cranes, ten Rheas, and three American > Mergansers. |
Among the reptiles, the most notable breeding was of the Burmese pythons in which three clutches were laid and 45 young snakes were hatched. This program was of great scientific interest as incu— bation of the eggs was carried out both artificially and naturally. In the latter case the females coiled around the egg masses, maintaining _ the proper body heat by rhythmic muscle twitchings. This process was of great interest to the visitors and particularly so since electrical © sensors were connected to recording thermometers to trace tempera| ture fluctuations.
The breeding program at the National Zoological Park is progressing quite well, space permitting, and the efforts of the scientific research department's behavioral studies, the contributions from the animal health department on nutrition, preventive medicine, as well as the diligent endeavors of the animal management department are

beginning to pay off. At the present time, 66 percent of all mammals |
exhibited at the Zoo are captive born either here or at other zoos. Approximately 30 percent of the mammals species, 14 percent of the bird species, 8 percent of the reptile and amphibian species in the collection are breeding. This is a slight but significant increase over previous years.
While it is pleasant to report on significant births, note must also be taken of deaths, and four famous old-timers at the Zoo have passed on. Pokodiak, a female hybrid bear (Alaskan Brown X Polar Bear), born in 1936, died in April at the age of 38 years. She is the last of the National Zoological Park’s famous hybrid bears which had such an eminently popular appeal due to their great size and unusual family background. Biggy, the 14-foot saltwater crocodile, one of the largest crocodilians in captivity, died this March after 42 years on exhibition. He was a spectacular animal and well beloved
by his visitors. The Silver-crested Cockatoo, Richard, originally —
known as Jacob, died in February. This bird was brought back from Sumatra as a mature bird by Dr. Mann with the 1937 National Geographic/Smithsonian Institution Expedition. He had been for many years in the home of a Dutch plantation owner and spoke a smattering of Dutch and Indonesian. He was a great delight to the visitors, being an excellent talker. He soon learned English, and one
of his favorite phrases, ‘open the door, Richard,” gradually brought ©
about his change in name by which in later years he was known. This bird was thoroughly imprinted on human beings and would have nothing to do with his feathered kin, preferring the company of humans; for this reason since 1965 he was exhibited in the Elephant House to the delight of thousands of children if not to the delight of the hippopotamuses, his nearest neighbors. His maniacal laughter, joyous whistling, and general rowdiness will be missed. He has been replaced by an Amazon parrot, who was given to the Zoo as a pet similarly imprinted. ANIMAL HEALTH AND PATHOLOGY
The animal health programs have continued with ongoing investigative research. With the addition of an assistant veterinarian, the program has been greatly accelerated, including initiation of a training course for Animal Keepers to expand their ability to recognize deviation from healthful behavior and habits which may signify the

existence of potential health problems. The death rate has lessened slightly and significant improvements are anticipated in the future.
Investigations into collection-based health problems were multiplied to include:
1. A study of avian orthopedics because existing fracture repair techniques fall short of preventing shattering in weakened bones. The techniques currently being tested consist of multiple pins and external fracture fixation.
2. A study of avian hematology to increase knowledge of the sources of avian diseases, a field heretofore not well studied even though species of birds represent the largest proportion of our collection. Diagnostic techniques involving use of blood serum constituents have been virtually unknown in birds. The study thus far indicates that white blood cell level might be an effective indicator of infectious diseases which respond to antibiotic treatment. A paper has been prepared and submitted for publication.
Science / 103

<<<Page: 118>>>

3. A Tiger Virus Disease study has been started to isolate the viral agent believed, as a result of tissue alterations identified through light microscopy, to be the possible cause of white tiger cubs’ deaths earlier in the year.
Studies continued into avian tuberculosis, selenium-vitamin E deficiency, chromosome studies for taxonomic designation, sable blood, reindeer metabolism, and the important area of establishing normal blood values for exotic species. The office has cooperated in the development of capture equipment and participated in field trials of newly developed immobilizing agents.
This unit has established a series of seminars for veterinarians on the East Coast that are involved in exotic-animal medicine, and this long-felt need for the improvement of exotic-animal medicine has been well received by the participants.
The Office of Zoological Research, under Dr. John Eisenberg, achieved notable progress on 24 projects in field mammalian ecology, reproduction, behavioral analysis, and nutritional ‘analysis. As one arbitrary measure of success, 28 original contributions were published in the department’s six years of history to 1972, and 43 titles, with 9 more now in press, since then. Nine graduate students and two postdoctoral students from six universities were guided and supported in 1974.
Field efforts in the neotropics by Dr. G. C. Montgomery illuminated the importance of the significant biomass contributions of the three-toed sloth and of the lesser anteater, as well as to improving chances for their eventual captive acclimatization. Other studies integrated with the National Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute advanced with respect to a host of rodent and primate species.
Methods for scoring the behavior of female mammals as they pass through estrus were developed by Dr. Devra Kleiman. Behavioral changes associated with estrus in the tigress were published for the first time. The role of olfaction as a mediator of reproductive behavior in the binturong was published. The propagation of the golden marmoset in the second generation was accomplished by Dr. Kleiman and associated staff. The analysis of reproductive behavior of the lesser panda and factors contributing to reproductive success in

the giant panda were described. The reproductive behavior and cycling in the Indian rhinoceros was worked out by Dr. H. K. Buechner and associates. Dr. Buechner also initiated a long-term study on the determination of estrus and sexual behavior in the sable antelope.
Studies on reproduction in caviomorph rodents have proceeded in the Zoo collection resulting in the first establishment of captive colonies of two — Octodontomys gliroides and Pediolagus salinicola — and the Zoo being in position to rear successfully two more. The breeding of Carollia perspicillata, a species of fruit bat, was a milestone study in the effective management of Chiropterans.
Recognizing the importance of olfaction and the role of olfactory signals in the priming and triggering of sexual behavior, several rodent species have been explored by Dr. Michael Murphy, including wild stocks of the golden hamster and three genera of caviomorph rodents.
Aspects of animal communication, the genesis of social bonds, and the structure of mammalian societies have been under intensive investigation with self-evident applications to animal management. For example, efforts in 1974 show that the success of second-generation breeding in the golden marmoset hinges upon an understanding of the formation of social bonds and the role of early experience in the participation of rearing young. Through analysis, such as are currently being carried on in the Zoo and in parallel in the field, an understanding and interpretation of communication in, for example, the spider monkey now becomes possible.
Dr. Eisenberg and his associates were deeply involved guiding the success of the Thirteenth International Congress of Ethology held in August with George Washington University and the Smithsonian Institution being the co-hosts. Scientists from many different nations attended, resulting in an exciting exchange of stimulating scientific information.
As mentioned previously the old Lion House has been demolished and the new exhibit will begin construction early in July. The character of “lion house hill” is changing and for the definite advantage of the big cats and their visiting public. The old Monkey House is being renovated at this time and should be completed early in the next calendar year. This house, built in 1904, will be modernized
Science / 105

<<<Page: 120>>>

to have 12 glass-fronted, larger inside exhibit cages and the corresponding number of outside cages. The selection of monkeys will be fewer than were exhibited before, but they will be in larger family groups. The old, small-cat house generally referred to as the “puma house” has been removed and plans are being prepared for its replacement by a series of free standing corn-crib-type cages to house the lesser cats, such as pumas, lynx, and servals. The dog line below the sea lion pool has also been removed with anticipated replacement next year by fewer but larger compounds.
Plans are proceeding for the renovation of the outside Elephant House yards as well as of the outside cages around the Bird House. New cheetah facilities are being presently constructed just north of the sea lion pool. This will consist of spacious double enclosures that will give the cheetahs a much larger area in which to run. This will also allow separation of the males and females and it is hoped will enable the establishment of a breeding program for these lovely cats. In this vein the Zoo has secured, on breeding loan, a pair of cheetahs from the Baltimore Zoo and a second pair from the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs. Based on recent success of cheetah breedings at the San Diego Zoo and Lion Country Safari, it is hoped that a rotating encounter program can be established between the males and the females which will result in successful breedings.
In 1974, an effort was launched to bring progress in graphics, exhibits, education, and information up to the pace now being set by the Zoo’s sound and progressive programs in animal management, animal health, and zoological research. The Visitor Services Group, led by an assistant director, assembled the Office of Graphics and Exhibits, Education and Information, and the Protective Services with the mission of providing the Zoo visitor good guidance and opportunities for quality educational experiences, and a high degree of public service and accommodation. This effort coordinates with the Friends of the National Zoo as they continue to carry the Zoo’s educational programs to the visitors, to the local school systems, and surrounding community.
The information and education staffs are being increased, and exhibits came under the control of an experienced and creative de-

signer in order to bring the interpretive program up to highest standards. This person will also work closely with the designers, Wyman and Cannon, Inc., contracted with under a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to develop a Master Graphics Plan and Design Manual for the Zoo.
Another important new service for both the employees and visitors was the appointment of a Health and Safety Officer, with increased emphasis on providing this vital area of visitor services.
Management efforts in general in fiscal 1974 focused on building up understanding and administrative capability at the level of the operating offices assembled into the Animal Programs Group, Visitor Services Group, and Central Services Group. Central management was reduced to a handful of people working to help guide the growth and progress of the ambitious and spirited Zoo staff.
Office of International and Environmental Programs
The new Office was established on October 15, 1973, combining the Offices of International Activities and Environmental Sciences. It is designed to further increase opportunities for the Smithsonian to conduct research abroad through the application of its traditional strengths in collection-based natural history to ecosystem-oriented studies in the tropics. A new International Environmental Science Program, incorporating the former programs in Oceanography, Limnology, and Ecology, was initiated at the end of the fiscal year. The previous program categories are used below to describe studies conducted during 1973.
The Office also continues to provide support to United States research institutions, including the Smithsonian, through Foreign Currency Program grants, and service to other Smithsonian units through the Liaison Section of the International Activities Program.
The Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, an independent unit of the Office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides for the rapid communication of technical data on natural and environmental phenomena of short duration through a global network of scientific correspondents.
Wymberley Coerr, formerly Ambassador to Ecuador and Uruguay, was appointed to head the new Office.

A series of ecological assessment studies in foreign countries, administered by the Office and supported by the Agency for International Development, was completed during the year. The studies included an analysis of the effect of oil pollution on marine organisms in Indonesia, a review of the environmental consequences of rapid urbanization in a developing country (Seoul, Korea), and the ecological impact of Lake Volta in Ghana, the world’s largest manmade lake. A 4-year study for the purpose of predicting the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly schistosomiasis, with the impoundment of the Mekong River and its tributaries, was completed.
During their combined 15 years of operations the Smithsonian’s two oceanographic sorting centers have processed bulk marine samples, monitored and assessed marine pollution, and conducted baseline and environmental prediction studies. In the past year, the centers have processed more than 8 million specimens for specialists and reference collections. Much of the material processed by the Oceanographic Sorting Center in Washington involved Arctic and Antarctic biological samples in cooperation with the nsF Office of Polar Programs. The biological and environmental data accompanying these samples have been computerized.
Over 3000 specimens at the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center have become a part of the Reference Collections of Mediterranean Marine Biota. Sorted specimens are divided equally and deposited in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and the Institut National Scientifique et Technique d’Oceanographie et de Peche.
The Existing Conditions of the Biota of the Chesapeake Bay Project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing information on the most important species of Chesapeake Bay, descriptions of community structure, and analyses of water quality criteria. An interim report was submitted in October, and the final report will be submitted during the fiscal year 1975. Coordination responsibilities of the report on the effects of Tropical Storm Agnes were also performed for the Corps.
The second year of a United States-Yugoslav aquatic study, entitled “Limnological Investigations of Lake Skadar,”” was successfully completed in cooperation with the Limnology Laboratory of

the Biological Institut of Titograd. Extensive progress was made in adequately equipping the laboratory and in sampling and analyzing the preliminary research results. Manuscripts are in progress and in press.
Development of comprehensive biological studies of marine and freshwater ecosystems in Egypt and Pakistan is proceeding. A postimpoundment ecological assessment of the Nam Ngum Reservoir in Laos was initiated in May 1974.
Liaison with other Smithsonian Institution aquatic sciences was continued, as was representation on various committees and councils concerned with oceanography and limnology.
An evaluation of environmental resources was undertaken in a study for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in connection with the Corps’ responsibility for preserving natural, historical, and cultural aspects of America’s natural heritage. The project involved a comprehensive review of current environmental inventories and literature on requirements for such inventories, a critique of pilot environmental reconnaissance inventories, and preparation of guidelines for agencies conducting statewide inventories of critical environmental areas. The guidebook deals with key issues and decisions that must be resolved in conducting the inventories and suggests methodology for delineating areas of critical environmental concern.
The Smithsonian Center for Natural Areas assists, through ecological studies, in planning and establishing priorities for the selection and preservation of ecologically significant areas. Natural areas include habitats of threatened species of plants, animals, and communities; important breeding and overwintering areas; sites of unique interest for research or education interests; and archeological and related locations that should be preserved. The Center has developed a quantitive evaluation technique of ecological indicators as a scientifically valid basis of assigning priorities for acquisition of permanent nature reserves by procuring agencies.
The Center published a 2-year, natural-areas study of the Chesapeake Bay region. The Nature Conservancy, co-sponsor of the study, intends to use the findings as one basis for procurement and designation as protected areas sites in the Chesapeake Bay watershed regarded as ecologically significant.
Science / 109

<<<Page: 124>>>

The Center prepared an inventory of ecologically representative sites within the Atlantic Coastal Region, together with descriptions and recommendations to assist the National Park Service in designating sites for its Registry of Natural Landmarks.
The Center is helping to assess the ecological consequences of activities at U.S. Air Force Bases in the continental United States in order to offer a scientific basis for suggesting improvements in conservation practices. A comprehensive survey was made for the Air Force of the existing data on the flora and fauna of Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, including both terrestrial and marine organisms. The baseline information was compiled for an evaluation required for an environmental impact statement for the islands.
The Center for Natural Areas, with approval of the Smithsonian, was incorporated as an independent organization during fiscal 1974. The Center’s studies henceforth will be supported by grants and contracts from foundations, charitable trusts, federal, and state agencies.
The Smithsonian-Peace Corps Environmental Program provides assistance in two general areas. It develops Peace Corps projects and assignments dealing with environmental and natural resource problems in the developing countries and recruits and places applicants skilled in the environmental biological sciences. Over 700 applications were received in fiscal 1974, and 207 volunteers with environmental skills were assigned to 28 countries. The volunteers were requested directly by the host governments for assignment to scientific and natural conservation programs.
As a part of the new Office of International and Environmental Programs, the International Activities Program has undergone no substantive changes in its functions.
As its major responsibility, the International Activities Program administers the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. This Program awards grants to support the research interests of American institutions, including the Smithsonian, in those countries where the United States holds “excess” amounts of local currencies, derived largely from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. Qualifying countries, where the Treasury Department deems United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of
110 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 125>>>

normal federal requirements, are presently India, Pakistan, Burma, Egypt, Tunisia, Guinea, and Poland. The Smithsonian received a fiscal 1974 appropriation of $4.5 million in “excess” currencies for the support of grants in the disciplines of archeology and the anthropological sciences, systematics and environmental biology, astrophysics and the earth sciences, and museum-related fields. During its first decade of operation, the Foreign Currency Program has awarded more than $24 million in foreign currency grants to more than 70 institutions in 32 states and the District of Columbia, involving some 220 museums, universities, and research institutions. Within the framework of the Program, the Smithsonian made arrangements in fiscal 1974 for the United States to contribute $1 million in support of unEsco efforts to save the submerged temples at Philae, Egypt. The Program participated in interagency negotiations leading to the establishment of a United States-Yugoslav Joint Board of Scientific and Technical Cooperation. This Board makes it possible to extend the period for which support will be available for already approved United States-Yugoslav cooperative research projects, including Smithsonian research in limnology and Smithsonian Foreign Currency-supported archeological research.
The International Liaison Section continues to provide other Smithsonian units with assistance in international matters involving travel and projects abroad. It coordinated the travel and research arrangements of the many foreign scholars visiting the Smithsonian, and it makes arrangements for other foreign visitors. A growing area of liaison responsibility is in special programs for foreign research cooperation. These include promoting Smithsonian scientific and scholarly cooperation with the People’s Republic of China and under binational arrangements with Israel and Germany.
The Center operates a worldwide electronic alert system for rapid communication of scientific data on natural and environmental phenomena of short duration. During the year the Center reported 155 short-lived events that occurred in 44 countries, islands, and ocean areas. Scientific field teams investigated 120 of the events. The reporting network consists of about 2000 scientists, scientific research institutions, and field stations located in 138 countries throughout the globe.
Science / 111

<<<Page: 126>>>

Scientists and other subscribers to the Center’s service receive information on significant changes in biological, ecological, and geophysical systems, including rare or unusual animal migrations, population increases, and mortalities, major floods, forest fires, and pollution events, such as oil and chemical spills, gas and radioactive substance leaks, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, and occasional astrophysical events, such as meteorite falls and fireballs.
The Center has enlarged its International Environmental Alert Network to include more than 60,000 secondary school and university students in over 800 schools throughout the United States and Canada, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Rumania, Jordan, Lebanon, Ghana, Korea, Singapore, Tanzania, Sudan, Sri Lanka, South West Africa, England, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Zambia, France, The Netherlands, and Kenya.
Services under contract were provided to the United Nations Environment Program; the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization; the United States National Aeronautic and Space Administration; and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Radiation Biology Laboratory
The importance and significance of energy as the driving force of our technological society became abundantly clear in 1974 as political and economic forces displaced familiar use patterns. Thus, the laboratory’s charter ‘to study the role of sunlight in maintaining life on the earth” anticipated current concerns by almost a half century. In fact, the purposes and objectives of the laboratory become increasingly important as the world’s population grows, and its food needs and requirements for diminishing fossil-fuel resources expand.
During fiscal 1974 the laboratory emphasized several major areas of research on aspects of solar radiation that influence biological systems: (1) measuring the solar energy received at the earth’s surface, its quantity, quality, and duration, since these parameters establish the starting point for all aspects of photobiology; (2) the biochemistry and biophysics of energy storage (photosynthesis) and the structures (pigments and membrane systems) involved in cap-
112 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 127>>>

turing the sun’s energy; (3) the regulation of the use of this stored energy by living organisms in response to complex signals of light, temperature, or gases in the environment; and (4) the use of the photosynthetic products to date the time when objects of biological origin were last alive and in equilibrium with the environment (carbon dating).
Measurements of solar energy were recorded from a monitoring network including four locations: Barrow, Alaska; Flamenco Island, Panama; the National Physical Laboratory in Jerusalem, Israel; and at Rockville, Maryland. This network covers the Northern Hemisphere reasonably well and records at three-minute intervals the energy received in six color bands, as well as the total energy from the ultraviolet short wavelength limit to the infrared (2.8 microns), where the energy per photon is no longer capable of driving photochemical reactions.
From this enormous volume of data have been extracted many useful pieces of information. For example, the area required for suitable collectors to provide the necessary energy to heat or to air condition buildings may be ‘calculated or estimates of the upper limits for plant growth in an area may be computed.
In addition, some data implicate solar ultraviolet with skin cancer incidence. Particularly, as more and more supersonic transport aircraft are flown, it is postulated that the fuel exhausts will catalyze the breakdown of the protective ozone screen in the atmosphere, which limits the amount of ultraviolet penetrating to the earth’s surface. In cooperation with the Air Resources Laboratories of NOAA, a scanning radiometer was stationed at Tallahassee, Florida. This instrument measures narrow bandwidths of ultraviolet in the erythemal (region of sunlight that causes skin reddening) band and these data are being tested to see if a correlation exists between quality and quantity received and the incidence of skin cancer (as measured by the National Cancer Institute) in Tallahassee.
Another important factor in solar irradiance measurements is the primary standard to which all measurements are referred. The Smithsonian has a long history of developing standards, and this year a symposium was held for international authorities on solar instruments and measurements to discuss and evaluate the initiation

and worldwide use of a uniform and precisely defined measuring scale. While there is, as yet, no consensus as to the best scale system, at least intercomparison may now be made in a more rational manner. The papers presented at this symposium will be published as a Smithsonian publication.
In order to pursue the importance of light on plant growth, four large growth chambers were installed in which the major parameters regulating plant growth can be controlled. These include the nutrient and root media, the atmospheric media and the light environment. Plants are grown on soil or artificial substrate systems (nutriculture).
Light in the environment also may regulate the rate of synthesis of cell components or the rate of metabolism and growth of plant parts. Such light signals must be absorbed by pigment molecules to be effective. During the past year the laboratory has been isolating and purifying the pigment phytochrome. By hydrolyzing it in various ways and determining the amino-acid composition of the various

peptides produced, information has been obtained about the molecular weight and the chemical structure of this protein pigment.
The phytochrome pigment was isolated from dark-grown rye seedlings. After purification, electrophoresis, and gel permeation chromatography of the undenatured protein indicated a molecular weight of about 400,000 daltons. Disc gel electrophoresis in detergents indicated a principal product was formed with a molecular weight of about 120,000 daltons. Cleavage of the protein was performed with cyanogen bromide, which reacts with methionine residues. This produced five peptides: one of 15,000 daltons, a chromopeptide containing the light-absorbing portion (11,000 daltons), one about 8000 daltons, and two smaller ones. These data are consistent with the 13S phytochrome being composed of one species of protomer having a molecular weight of 42,000 and 4 methionine residues per protomer.
Another approach to the molecular function of phytochrome is the determination of the dependence of physiological responses upon the dose of light given. For a number of flowering plants, such as peas and mustard, dose-response curves were determined, as well as changes in the dose-response curves following sequential exposures to light. In addition, the capacity for rapid chlorphyll accumulation was measured. Data indicate that the physiologically active form of phytochrome produced by the first red exposure migrates to a membrane surface, which results in more light being required for a given response. But once light is absorbed, it is more effective because the active molecule is already attached to a membrane involved in the response.
For photosynthesis to occur efficiently, the incident sunlight must be absorbed in all wavelength regions. Algae have solved this problem by forming special pigment protein complexes known as phycobilisomes. These complexes trap the light energy and transfer it to a “reaction center,” where it is used to produce energy-rich compounds. Phycobilisomes can be isolated and then dissociated into their component parts. A model has been developed this year that describes at the molecular level the spatial arrangement of at least four pigments involved and their attachment to the photosynthetic membranes.
The chloroplasts of higher plants also trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy. Formation of chloroplasts and the
116 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 131>>>

maintenance of chloroplast structure is a fascinating problem that is attracting considerable attention. Making the proteins for a functional chloroplast requires cooperation between nuclear and chloroplast genetic systems. That is, the genetic material for and the synthesis of certain chloroplast proteins are located in the nucleus and cytoplasm respectively, while the genetic material for and the synthesis of other chloroplast proteins are located in the chloroplast. Part of the chloroplast protein synthesis occurs on chloroplast photosynthetic membranes.
During the past year, a system was developed in which biosynthesis of chloroplast photosynthetic membranes could be studied in vitro. In actively growing cells of the alga Chlamydomonas, a large portion of chloroplast ribosomes exists attached to the photosynthetic membranes. Electron micrographs of isolated membranes show that some of the ribosomes are bound as polyribosomes. When the membranes are dissolved by detergent, these polyribosomes can be recovered and account for more than half of the ribosomes bound to the membranes. These results suggest that the membrane-ribosome association functions in protein synthesis, because polysomes occur when active protein synthesis takes place. This assumption was confirmed by the finding that the isolated membrane-ribosome association will carry out protein synthesis. This protein synthesis reaction depends on the presence of the ribosomes attached to the membranes. It is inhibited by chloramphenicol, not by cycloheximide, as is expected for protein synthesis by chloroplast ribosomes. The protein synthesis reaction requires an energy generation system and a soluble cell extract. The reaction is inhibited by ribonuclease. These properties indicate that the protein synthesis reaction is carried out by the isolated membranes.
Blue light regulates the biosynthesis of yellow pigments, such as the vitamin A precursor, 8-carotene. At least eight different carotenoids are synthesized after light exposure of dark-grown mycelial pads of the bread mold Neurospora crassa. The photoinduction of these pigments can be divided into at least three phases: (a) a rapid light reaction, (b) a period of protein synthesis, and (c) accumulation of the carotenoid pigment.
The effect of temperature on these processes has been studied this year. The light reaction, of course, is temperature-independent, but synthesis immediately following light exposure has an optimum
Science / 117

<<<Page: 132>>>

near 6°C. These data, as well as studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis, indicate that the light reaction produces an inducer that activates a gene. The genetic code in the activated gene specifies the amino-acid sequence of an enzyme required for carotenoid biosynthesis. This enzyme is apparently absent in dark-grown cultures. Furthermore, physiological evidence indicates that the inducer is lost from the carotenoid-synthesizing system in a temperaturedependent competitive reaction.
In addition, four different types of mutant strains of Neurospora were produced from wild type by vv light: albinos, which do not make pigment even in the presence of light; yellow-orange mutants, which synthesize a different distribution of pigments; mutants in which the sensitivity of carotenoid synthesis to temperatures above 6°C has been reduced; and mutants which can make pigment in the dark.
The activities of many enzymes in organisms from bacteria to man appear to be under the control of cyclic-amp (adenosine monophosphate). For example, in man the hormones epinephrine or glucagon stimulate the synthesis of cyclic-amp, which in turn activates a series of enzymes required for starch breakdown. Evidence has been obtained that animal cells that have been transformed by a virus to cancerous cells have lower than normal cyclic-amp levels. There is evidence in frogs and rats that light controls the level of cyclic-amp. We have obtained evidence that such a control system exists in Neurospora and may be part of the mechanism for photoinduction of carotenoid synthesis. Since cyclic-amp probably regulates the activities of many different enzymes in Neurospora, then control of the level of cyclic-amp by light should regulate a number of biochemical pathways besides carotenoid synthesis. Such a control mechanism can be conveniently studied in Neurospora and the results used to predict the type of control system that operates in higher organisms.
Light acts not only as a carrier of information for regulating metabolism but is also absorbed and stored as chemical energy, along with the production of oxygen as a byproduct (photosynthesis). If leaves of plants are exposed to low temperatures (chilling), there is an inhibition in the rate of fixation of carbon dioxide. In addition, the
118 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 133>>>

oxygen-evolving power of leaves after cold storage is regulated by mangano-protein in the chloroplast thylakoids. Since a great deal of the world’s agriculture and the distribution of wild plant populations are limited by temperature, it is important to determine the portion of the photosynthetic mechanism directly affected by chilling. Plants that were grown under very warm conditions (30°C) were exposed to a succession of days and nights of cool (10°C day, 5°C night) temperatures, and the ability of whole leaves to take up carbon dioxide was measured. Within 24 hours after exposure to low temperature, the plants’ capacity to take up carbon dioxide at warm temperatures was reduced by about 25 percent. Longer exposure to low temperature brings with it further reduction in carbon assimilation.
The process of photosynthesis involves considerably more than carbon dioxide assimilation, and in order to determine which of the many steps is affected by changes in temperature, a partitioning of the process was attempted. Photosynthetic cells from the leaf were separated from the remaining nonphotosynthetic tissue. Active whole cells were obtained which retain the capacity to evolve oxygen using light. Exposure of plants to chilling temperatures, however, does not consistently affect the capacity of cells extracted from these plants to evolve oxygen. Sometimes there is a substantial reduction in oxygen evolution and sometimes only minor change. The reason for this variability is as yet unknown.
Measurements have been made of the total productive capacity for communities of plants in a salt marsh in the Chesapeake Bay. It has been assumed that salt marshes contribute substantially to their neighboring estuaries and are consequently essential to the maintenance of life in the estuaries. Assimilated carbon in the marsh is exported to the estuary; however, most data for this assumption are based upon an incomplete examination of the capacity of the marsh to take up and metabolize carbon! A plastic chamber to enclose a section of the marsh community has been constructed in conjunction with a continuous flow, infrared, gas-analysis system to monitor the net carbon dioxide exchange over the marsh community.
In addition to net carbon dioxide exchange, a method has been evaluated for determining the amount of green matter in a marsh without the necessity of destroying any of the community being

Carbon dioxide concentration is determined in air as it enters and leaves the chamber. Below: Radiometer device for measuring reflectance of red and far-red light from a marsh community. Reflectance measurements are used in estimating the standing crop biomass.

studied. The method depends upon the fact that green plants reflect red light less than they reflect far-red radiation (light that is at and just beyond the sensitivity of the human eye). The seasonal change in reflectance of these two bands of light was found to change as the total amount of green matter in the stand of plants changed. This method was originally developed to study productivity of prairie communities, but the method appears to work in marshes. A correlation was found between the reflectance measurements and direct measurements of biomass obtained by cutting and weighing samples. Thus, a rapid, nondestructive assay of growth in marshes can be obtained. The method also has the advantage that the equipment is portable and, thus, usable in remote locations.
The growth of plants in an estuarine environment is sometimes limited by phosphorus cycling in the tidal environment. Phosphorus flux rates and phosphorus cycling in situ in the tidal marsh, mud flat periphyton, and plankton communities of the Rhode River subestuary of Chesapeake Bay were measured. Techniques employed included phosphorus-32-orthophosphate uptake and chase kinetics,

analysis of specific and total activity in various metabolically meaningful phosphorus fractions, detailed chromatographic fractionation, continuous-flow pulse-labeling of plankton, direct microscopic examination of microbial communities, and phosphorus-33 microautoradiography. From these data the major pathways of phosphorus } cycling in estuarine plankton were constructed. The heavy arrows | are believed to be main pathways. Microbiological data, as well as: the size classing and inhibitor data, support this picture. Thus, | orthophosphate is taken up mostly by bacteria that are mainly on) the surfaces of suspended sediments and detritus, but phytoplankton } also take up some orthophosphate in the light. The bacteria and} phytoplankton are then eaten by filter feeders, especially ciliate» protozoans. These in turn release most of the phosphorus as dis| solved orthophosphate and organic phosphorus.
In addition, the phosphorus cycling in a deciduous forest when) subjected to various levels of mineral nutrient loading was measured. Phosphorus loading of the leaf-litter zone beneath beech trees in) Maryland was varied from the “natural” level (3 to 12 mg P.m~** | day~") to 430 mg P.m~**day—? above the natural level. Phosphorus32 was used to measure rates and to determine pathways of phosphorus cycling. Upon increased loading, the phosphorus content of ' the litter increased fourfold and then stabilized. When this loading was discontinued, the phosphorus content of the litter declined to the original level. Phosphorus not assimilated by the leaf litter moved rapidly through the soil both vertically and horizontally. Forest trees obtained most of their phosphorus from the litter zone.
Sometimes the effects of a sudden dramatic changes in energy — flow in the environment can be assayed. Such a dynamic stress occurred in tropical storm Agnes. Although the storm center cir-_ cumnavigated the Rhode River estuary, the salinity reached a minimum about two weeks later because of flooding by the Susque| hanna River. This event was coincident with the year’s highest water | temperature (30-31°C) and resulted in severe mortalities in the i biota. Periphyton (attached microbial communities) experienced a _ nearly complete die-off. High levels of sediments and of nutrients, — especially nitrate and totalphosphorus, were delivered to Rhode River by the bay proper and from local runoff. These nutrients were deposited in Rhode River bottom sediments. This reservoir released nutrients a year later, especially at a time of low dissolved
122 / Smithsonian Year 1974 |

<<<Page: 137>>>

‘oxygen in the bottom water and of intensive dinoflagellate blooms.
In a 13-day period it is estimated that over 900 Kg phosphorus was released from the bottom sediments. Thus, even though the effects were indirect from tropical storm Agnes, they were large.
Because all living things are in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and this equilibrium is fixed at the time of death, with the radioactive carbon"! gradually decaying away as the sample ages, it is possible to determine the age of biological specimens back to about 40,000 years by measuring their radioactive carbon! content. From data taken from the remains and artifacts of archaic populations, it is possible to explore the relationships between changing environments and changing cultures.
From such artifacts a chronological framework is being constructed for populations in North America. In cooperation with anthropologists, geologists, and palynologists the time period 6000 'B.c to 2000 B.c. has been examined for northeastern North America.
Of particular interest is the date of entry of man into the New World. In cooperation with the University of Alaska, dating of selected archeological and geological sites discovered during construction of the Alaska pipeline have been accomplished. Recent findings published by the Scripps Institution, using the determination of racemic mixtures of aspartic acid, indicate that man was present in North America at least 50,000 years before the present. However, dates from the North Slope in our laboratory confirm occupation of more than 10,000 years ago.
Thus, the requirement for more energy to drive our technology that resulted in the need for the Alaska pipeline has yielded as a secondary scientific benefit an indication of man’s early history in
the New World.
Lectures and invited symposium talks were presented by the staff to more than 30 research institutions and universities, both nationally and internationally. Hundreds of reprints of published data were distributed to interested professional colleagues, and several | staff members taught seminars and courses in their professional specialties.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
On July 1, 1973, the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University established at Cambridge, Massachusetts, a Center for Astrophysics
to coordinate the related research activities of the Smithsonian |
Astrophysical Observatory (sao) and the Harvard College Observatory (Hco) under a single director.
At that time, George B. Field, Professor of Astronomy at Harvard |
University, became the director of the joint facility and of both
observatories, succeeding Fred L. Whipple of sao and Alexander
Dalgarno of Hco.
The creation of this new consolidated science program, drawing on the resources of the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard University to achieve scientific excellence, is both a response to the new research goals and opportunities of the present and a reflection of traditional ties of the past.
During the past decade, astrophysics has experienced an explosion of ideas. New windows on the universe have been opened by the discovery of radiation in unexpected bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. And the expanded use of rocket, balloon, and satellite experiments has allowed observation of this radiation from above
the earth’s obscuring atmosphere. Gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet
light, and infrared radiation are all now observed almost as routinely as radio and visible waves. Each new spectrum window has revealed a vast and varied universe filled with objects defying the imagination: quasars, pulsars, X-ray and gamma-ray stars, black holes, and neutron stars, as well as massive interstellar clouds of dust particles and complex molecules.
When it was founded by Samuel Pierpont Langley in 1890, the goal of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was the increase and diffusion of knowledge about the earth and its immediate astronomical environment. This goal remains unchanged today; however, the technological developments in observational techniques and data analysis, coupled with unusual advances in theoretical astronomy, now allow Smithsonian scientists to expand their astronomical horizons to the very edge of the universe.
Two major scientific problems are at the core of this expanded astronomical research program. The first is the evolution of matter, starting with the explosive beginning of the universe some 20 billion
124 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 139>>>

years ago. After the formation of galaxies and stars, some matter collapsed into those exotic and unusual objects known as quasars, neutron stars, and black holes.
The extreme physical conditions existing in these objects severely test all the fundamental principles of modern physics. Obviously, the evolutionary processes forming stars and galaxies hold clues to how the universe began — and how it may end!
| The second problem concerns the cosmic matter that has cooled sufficiently for molecules and solid particles to form. The condensation of materials accompanying the formation of stars like our own sun apparently results in the formation of planets and the eventual emergence of life. Through continued studies of this matter in space, as well as of the sun, planets, and earth, sao scientists seek to understand the processes that led to the origin of life in the universe.
The solution of these two problems in modern astronomy can be achieved only through the concerted efforts of a variety of investigators using a diversity of approaches. For example, the study of matter under extreme conditions can be approached through highenergy astrophysics, solar and stellar physics, or optical astronomy; while the study of solid particles can be approached through infrared and radio astronomy, planetary sciences or geoastronomy. Theoretical and laboratory studies underlie each approach. Each approach also requires quite different research tools, ranging from rocket, balloon, and satellite detectors for gamma-ray and X-ray astronomy, to shock-tube and radiation laboratories and computers for molecular and atomic physics.
The complexity of modern astronomical research thus demands the consolidation of efforts whenever possible. The Center for Astrophysics is designed for this purpose — to draw on the different strengths of the Smithsonian and Harvard observatories. The once loose groupings of scientists and projects are now concentrated in eight divisions representing the major approaches to the dual problems of cosmic evolution and life in the universe.
The laboratory and theoretical program of this division are closely related to other experimental and observational programs at the Center. Specifically, this group is concerned with the chemical re-

<<<Page: 140>>>

in theoretical atomic physics, the calculation of atomic transition)| probabilities, and the application of laser techniques to atomic and‘
of data returned from other Center space programs.
This division continues sao’s long-term program to study earth | dynamics, the upper atmosphere, and earth’s gravitational field.
In cooperation with scores of other organizations around the} world, the earth dynamics program is building the large data base | necessary to define the kinematics, bulk dynamics, and mass distri| bution of the earth. The program depends heavily on sao’s sophisti| cated laser and camera satellite-tracking network, supported by the | National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The upper atmospheric research program uses computer analysis | of the anomalies in satellite orbits to develop accurate models of | the earth’s gravity field and to define the forces exerted by both sunshine and earthshine.
A gravitational redshift project will utilize an extremely accurate, rocket-borne, maser clock, paired with a similar ground-based instrument, to test the equivalence principle of Einstein’s Theory — of Relativity in the gravitational field of the earth.
The Center is emerging as a national leader in the field of highenergy astronomy, and particularly X-ray research, through its participation in the nasa-sponsored series of high-energy astronomical observatories (HEAO). Major efforts are directed toward construction and planning of experiments aboard the HEAO-B, now scheduled for launch in 1975 as the first true space observatory capable of high angular resolution X-ray observations. This satellite will permit the first studies of the X-ray structure of extended objects and complex sources. In the meantime, the division continues its analysis of data obtained byuHuRU satellite, the pioneering experiment in this field. This effort has led to the first identification of a probable “black hole” in the constellation Cygnus.

Ground-based observations at Mt. Hopkins have led to the detection of gamma-ray emissions from the Crab Nebula. OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY
This division’s activities fall in four related areas: studies of infrared emissions from galaxies and H II regions; studies of the spectra of stars and circumstellar materials; analysis of the spectra of interstellar materials and planetary atmospheres; and optical studies of ‘emission from X-ray sources and pulsars. Observations are made ‘with Center instruments at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona; Agassiz Station, Massachusetts; and Boyden Station, South Africa; as well as with instruments at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, and _ Hale Observatories, California, and their respective Southern | Hemisphere installations at Cerro Tololo and Las Campanas, Chile. The Harvard component of these observing programs is supported by the National Science Foundation (NsF).
This division’s observational capabilities will be greatly enhanced by the addition of a large telescope of revolutionary design. Thismultiple-mirror telescope (MMT) combines six 72-inch mirrors in a hexagonal array around a central core to produce an instrument with the light-gathering capacity of a conventional 176-inch telescope. The mnt is now under construction jointly by sao and the University of Arizona.
Traditionally, sao has been a recognized leader in the study of the smaller bodies of the solar system. Vigorous programs involving geochemical and petrological analyses of lunar and meteoritical samples continue, as does the remote sensing of planets, satellites, and asteroids, largely supported by Nasa.
Observations of comets, combined with computer analyses of their orbits and laboratory studies of their physical properties, also continue. During the past year, the Center served as a major clearinghouse for information related to the international program to observe and study Comet Kohoutek. Theoretical work in this field is being supported through Harvard by nsr.
The Center’s radio astronomy program results from the strong
Science / 127

<<<Page: 142>>>

efforts begun at the Harvard College Observatory with NsF support. |
It includes capability in both the centimeter and the millimeter wavelength bands of the radio spectrum. Laboratory facilities support the observational program by measuring properties of spectral lines in these wavelengths. This combined effort has identified several new interstellar molecules.
A cooperative program continues with the University of Texas to conduct observations in the 2and 3-millimeter wavelength
bands.
The Center’s unusually strong program in this field is founded on the observational data provided by the Harvard solar satellite program and the theoretical work done by sao scientists in the development of model stellar atmospheres. The extensive data produced by the Harvard experiment aboard nasa’s Skylab satellite should provide the basis for several years of analysis and interpretation leading to a new understanding of the energy-generation processes in the outer layers of the sun. The broad range of sao-developed computer programs and theoretical techniques is being applied to the interpretation of ultraviolet solar and stellar observations, both from Skylab and other satellites such as Copernicus. In addition, the successful flight of a balloon-mounted 40-inch infrared telescope in early 1974 demonstrated the feasibility of further large-aperture flights for broadband photometry and mapping, multiband and galactic sources. This project was a joint venture of sao, Hco, and the University of Arizona.
If the Center is distinguished by its broad spectrum of astrophysical problems under investigation, then it is the theoretical effort that serves as the catalyst encouraging active and fruitful interrelationships among different approaches to similar problems. Thus, the objectives of this division are to establish and maintain expertise in those areas of physics underlying the applications to astrophysics, to create active research areas along a broad front, and to alert the Center staff of new directions in astrophysics. Most important, perhaps, this division plays a major role in the Center’s commitment to astronomy education: identifying, encouraging, and training new

jastronomers, as well as bringing talented students and younger professionals into its research program. Much of this division’s effort is also supported by nsr.
| The pooling of Smithsonian and Harvard scientific resources in a Center for Astrophysics seems an appropriately modern and rational adaptation to the times. Oddly enough, it is more the natural evolution of the long relationship between the two organizations. Since 1955, when the headquarters of sao moved to the grounds of the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, the two observatories have pursued astronomical research in close collaboration, with many members of the Smithsonian staff holding joint appointments at Harvard and using University-owned facilities.
The ties between Harvard and Smithsonian, however, reach back into the nineteenth century, when Harvard alumnus and United ‘States President John Quincy Adams urged both his alma mater and his Congress to establish jointly an astronomical observatory to serve the nation, preferably under the aegis of the Smithsonian Institution.
Echoing this call for joint academic-government action, Joseph Henry, first Secretary of the Institution, later urged that any observatory established by the Smithsonian should be “closely connected with some well-endowed and well-established college or university.”
Nearly a century and a half have passed, but the dreams of both Joseph Henry and John Quincy Adams are finally realized in the Center for Astrophysics. This cooperative venture has great implications for the future, not only because it may serve as a guide for other similar pairings of private and public institutions, but also because the basic goals it pursues must surely affect all aspects of human life — from genetics to energy production.
Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc.
This year has been an important one for the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange (ssi) as it actively began its efforts to move from a national center for information about ongoing research to one more international in terms of coverage and use of its services. The Exchange, which has provided services to foreign users over the
Science / 129

<<<Page: 144>>>

years, has now begun to seek and include input on research in | progress overseas in a more concerted way, while at the same time | it has also increased its coverage at the national level. |
Many of the problems now confronting our own government are of equal concern to other countries, and these new national priorities | require a knowledge of ongoing research in other countries as well. Such information will ultimately be available through the Exchange | as present plans to increase its coverage develop over the next few | years. Efforts to increase coverage in such major areas as agricultural | research, cancer, energy and environmental research are already underway, supported by both federal and nonfederal organizations | as well as through the help of both national and international organizations.
The Exchange is presently exploring all feasible ways for collecting or developing access to a comprehensive record of worldwide scientific and technical research and development work in progress | and to exercise vigorous United States leadership in creating a sys| tem for storing and exchanging such information with initial efforts ! directed toward those programs of primary national interest. These are at least seven data bases of ongoing research currently in exist| ence in other countries and many others are being developed. Input | or exchange from these as well as selected input in specialized areas of interest from other countries will enhance the value of the Exchange’s data base to both scientists and research managers in | the United States. Many of the systems currently in existence are based on systems that were developed along the lines of the Exchange’s system following visits to the sste. Compatibility between systems will be encouraged wherever possible to facilitate exchange of information.
As a consequence of its efforts in the fiscal year 1974, the Ex| change has increased foreign input and established methods for increased use of the Exchange by foreign scientists. To illustrate the latter, an agreement has been reached with the Institute for Documentation in the Federal Republic of Germany which will | provide support for the use of ssrE services by a large number of German scientists over an initial one-year period. The project will provide an opportunity for,a large number of German research © investigators to observe firsthand the value of learning before publi| cation what their colleagues in the United States are doing in areas —
130 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 145>>>

of research closely paralleling their own efforts. It may also expedite development of similar systems such as ssiE in Germany as well as lead to more cooperative efforts on problems of similar interest and an exchange of ongoing research information.
The Exchange has continued to explore and implement techniques for increased utilization of its information by coupling it with bibliographic information including both scientific journal literature and technical reports. These efforts include the use of publications containing the combined information as well as coupling of information obtained directly from the ssie data base with that from other information systems, thus providing users of such material with the latest in both published and ongoing research information. Discussions have taken place with several Federal data-base systems to expand this approach and offer remote on-line searches of selected portions of the Exchange’s data base.
Considerable progress has been made in the development and testing of a new machine-aided indexing system. This system, which was designed to help the Exchange’s staff of professional scientists and engineers cope with the increasing volume of information coming into the Exchange, will also be of interest and value to other information systems of a similar nature. The system is not intended to replace the scientific expertise necessary for maintaining a high quality of indexing but rather complements it by picking up routine terms that are readily identifiable, freeing the scientists to concentrate on the more important aspect of conceptual indexing. Publication of the technique will be made following more extensive testing of the system in the coming year. This project is another example of the Exchange’s continuing effort in research and development designed not only to improve the ssir’s system but make such developments available by publication for use throughout the information community.
The Exchange as a result of offering new services and expanding previously available ones has shown an increase in use in fiscal 1974 primarily as a result of making more scientists aware of the Exchange’s services. The response by many users to the Exchange’s Newsletter has been excellent in terms of increased subscriptions and products ordered through this organ. The Exchange’s continuing user-evaluation program indicates that it is providing a highly useful and important service. The Exchange has also developed

closer liaison with Federal agencies to increase their utilization of SSIE services in the management of their own research programs particularly in areas of high national interest.
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute
This year marked a change in the administration of the Smithsonian | Tropical Research Institute. Dr. Martin H. Moynihan, in order to |
devote his full time to research, resigned to become a senior scientist
at the Institute after directing this bureau for 16 years. During this —
| | | | | | :
period he guided stri’s growth from a biological preserve and small
field camp on Barro Colorado Island to a research institute with a worldwide reputation. During Dr. Moynihan’s tenure the permanent professional staff increased from 1 to 15, and the geographic scope of their investigations extended from Barro Colorado Island and the surrounding forests to adjacent areas of Central and South America, and then to intertropical comparisons in Gabon, Ceylon, India, Madagascar, Malaya, and New Guinea. Moynihan supported a program of student fellowship at both the preand post-doctoral level and encouraged a steadily increasing number of scientific visitors from around the world.
The research of the institute’s staff closely reflects the depth and diversity of Dr. Moynihan’s own scientific interests, which in the last 15 years have ranged from the behavior, evolution, and ecology of such diverse groups as birds, primates, and cephalopods. Research on the latter group was facilitated by the development of a marine research program and stri marine laboratories on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Panama.
Ira Rubinoff was appointed the new Director, and A. Stanley Rand has assumed the responsibilities of Assistant Director of sTRI.
The development of str1 research program was paralleled by an increase in facilities and support staff. These include, new animalkeeping facilities, air-conditioned laboratories, sea-water systems, research vessels, and an excellent tropical biology library, which now includes over 14,000 volumes and served approximately 4000 patrons in fiscal 1974.
Research at strI continues to be primarily concerned with basic
132 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 147>>>

| scientific questions of the evolutionary and ecological adaptations _of tropical organisms.
Two new scientists joined our staff in the fiscal year 1974. Olga F. Linares is an anthropologist studying human paleoecological processes and contemporary subsistence adaptations to the American and African tropics. Alan P. Smith, a plant ecologist, has accepted a joint appointment with str1 and the University of Pennsylvania. He will examine the physiological adaptations to seasonality of plants on Barro Colorado Island.
Scientists at stRI continued their studies concerning a variety of organisms.
R. L. Dressler spent several weeks in field work in Mexico studying orchids and their pollinators. He published two books: Orquideas de las Américas (with Mariano Ospina H.), the first general reference book on American orchids in Spanish, and The Genus Encyclia in Mexico (with Glenn E. Pollard), the first detailed treatment of that group. A Spanish edition of the latter volume will be published shortly.

The history of coral reefs off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Panama are being investigated by Peter Glynn and his associates. They are taking core samples through the reefs in order to determine the age of the reefs and their species composition at different levels. Reefs in Panama have been found to be about 6000 years old. Over | the past 1000 years significant changes in coral populations have occurred on a Caribbean fringe reef, but the causes of these changes are not presently known.
J. Graham studied the diving capability of the sea snake Pelamis platurus, which is common along the Pacific Coast of Panama, and found that while the snake has some of the typical adaptations found among vertebrate divers, it can also respire aquatically. J. H. Gee of the University of Manitoba spent a sabbatical year at str1 and collaborated with Graham and F. S. Robison in a study of buoyancy adjustment during diving of sea snakes.
E. Leigh took a field trip to the Amazon region of Peru to continue his comparative studies of the structure of tropical forests.
M. Moynihan and A. Rodaniche have continued their studies on the social behavior of the Caribbean squid Sepioteuthis sepioidea and have begun observations on a number of Pacific Ocean cephalopods. M. Moynihan has completed his book The New World Primates, which should be published shortly.
A. S. Rand continues his analysis of the displays of species of Anolis. He began to develop the first animated lizard display film, which will provide a tool for dissecting displays into their components and analyzing the functional aspects of these components.
Michael and Barbara Robinson continued studies of the ecology and behavior of tropical spiders. They investigated the ontogeny of predatory behavior in orb-web spiders, demonstrated by deprivation experiments that the spiders’ ability to discriminate between certain types of prey is not dependent on previous experience and is, therefore, not learned. In New Guinea, the Robinsons resumed studies of the defensive behavior of the rich orthopteroid fauna of the island. The latter studies suggest that the evolution of defensive behavior in these insects has been strongly influenced by the presence of a unique assemblage of predatory nocturnal marsupials.
R. Rubinoff continues her studies of the behavior of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum and has succeeded in demonstrating a social component to their “clumping” behavior.

Virtually all of the Swainson’s Hawks in the United States pass through Panama during migration, as do large numbers of other ~ North American hawks and vultures. By photographing the sky along the migration routes, Neal Smith has begun to evaluate the abundance and population characteristics of these hawks. These data should provide a useful index of the environmental quality of the North American nesting areas of these birds.
N. Smythe, in addition to his work with the Environmental Sciences Program, continues his studies of mammalian behavioral ecology.
H. Wolda continued his studies of fluctuation in abundance of insect species. The moth Zunacetha annulata, which had a major outbreak in 1971, had a somewhat smaller outbreak in 1973. Species of the homopteran genus Empoasca had major peaks in abundance in March-April in the last three years and were virtually absent in the same period in 1974. The cicada Fidicina mannifera was much less abundant in 1973 than in 1972, as evidenced by monitoring the sound, number of pupal cases, and by light-trap data. Among the important factors influencing these fluctuations are the strategies of the species in dealing with unpredictable patterns of rainfall and dry season.
C. Birkeland is comparing the community structure and dynamics of benthic marine populations on the coasts of Panama.
D. Meyer continues his studies of crinoid populations in collaboration with B. Macurda of the University of Michigan.
P. Campanella has examined territorial behavior of four species of dragonflies. Males of some species show a high degree of mating site specificity, which appears to be related to population density and availability of suitable ovipositing sites. Territory sizes are reduced and spatial overlap is avoided by using the ponds at different times of the day.
M. May has continued studies on the effects of heat exchange, heat production, and thermal tolerance in dragonflies of such factors as body size, temporal and spatial distribution patterns, and various energy-using activities.
R. Warner began an investigation of the adaptive significance of intersexuality commonly found in coral-reef fishes. He is correlating population structure and behavior with the dynamics of sex change in these fishes.

Censuses of Polistine wasps were carried out for a second year in Costa Rica by D. Windsor. He has shown that in response to the poorer foraging conditions and higher predator pressures of the dry season there is an increase in the number of females per nesting attempt. These and other observations indicate that sociality has evolved to aid reproduction during periods of poorer environmental conditions.
The carnivores of the New World tropics are poorly known, particularly when compared with those of Africa and Asia, where recent studies on mongoose, lion, hyena, and tiger have been published. R. F. Ewer has been at stri for the past year as a visiting senior scholar. She has been studying the ethology of two neotropical cats (ocelots and jaguarundis) and two mustelids (tayras and grisons). Particular attention has been devoted to studying social and preycapturing behavior.
D. Robertson, supported by a Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization (cstro) fellowship, is studying the patterns of spawning activities in Thallasoma bifasciatum and its relationships to hermaphroditism in this species.
Y. Lubin completed her study of the nonadhesive orb-webs of Cyrtophora moluccensis and is now collaborating with G. Montgomery on a radio-tracking study of tamandua.
In fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Institution’s Environmental Sciences Program continued ecological monitoring at the three sTRI sites in Panama. This interbureau effort in the tropics currently involves the cooperation of about 10 principal investigators from four bureaus. Spectral quality of solar radiation is being measured at Flamenco Island. On Barro Colorado Island the emphasis is on the tropical forests. We are beginning to understand the way in which year-to-year fluctuations in climate, particularly in the amount and distribution of rainfall, affect the plants and their responses, in turn, affect the animals. At Galeta, studies are proceeding on the reef flat. Interest focuses on the causes of unpredictable periods of reef exposure and the impact these have on the intertidal community and its recovery patterns.
STRI sponsored a workshop on the problems and strategies of seedlings in tropical forests. Eight scientists from four countries participated in a three-day meeting on Barro Colorado Island (Bc1).
This year grants were obtained from the Henry L. and Grace

Doherty and the Edward John Noble foundations for the purpose of providing short-term fellowships to assist students in tropical research. A number of students from United States and Panamanian universities have already begun research supported by these funds.
A number of our staff engaged in formal teaching this year. O. Linares taught Anthropology at the University of Texas. J. Graham taught in the Fundamental Ecology course of the Organization for Tropical Studies. P. Campanella gave a course in Ecology at the Canal Zone College, and M. Robinson taught Invertebrate Behavior at the University of Papua and New Guinea.
Use of stri facilities continues to increase. stRI was host to 722 scientific visitors from 111 universities and other organizations. These visitors represented 28 states and Puerto Rico as well as 21 countries from the Old and New Worlds. Twenty of these visitors spent a full year at str1. The appointment of M. Quinley in February as part-time docent has enabled us to initiate tours of str1 by primary and secondary school and university groups.
During 1974 major redevelopment of the scr waterfront area was begun. The old boathouse was demolished, dredging has been completed, and the driving of new piles is scheduled. A new boathouse and bulwark are planned. A small dormitory has been provided for the Pacific Coast marine facilities.
Renovation of the new Tivoli laboratory has been initiated. The building has been reroofed, the exterior painted, and work has begun to install the first seven laboratories.

Smithsonian Year * 1974
IN SINGLING ouT a few particularly noteworthy events of the past year one runs the risk of paying too little attention to the continuing, quiet achievements that in the long run are perhaps more important. The temptation to stress dramatic change at the expense of often undramatic continuity is familiar to every historian, and to every writer of annual reports.
Before succumbing to the temptation, then, we should at least begin by saying that the past year was marked by steady growth and consolidation within each of the Institution’s history and art bureaus, and by encouraging signs of continuing cooperation among them. Without exception, collections were improved both by acquisition and by conservation; control over collections was strengthened by better cataloguing and storage techniques; new exhibitions were mounted with satisfying regularity; research and publication continued in the best Smithsonian tradition; and programs of public education made our collections and our research more accessible to thousands of children and adults.
The gradual growth of cooperation among our history and art bureaus is another very welcome aspect of continuity rather than of dramatic change. The joint appointment of a Curator of American Art by the Freer Gallery of Art and the National Collection of Fine Arts will strengthen both museums and will bring the Freer’s important collection of American paintings into the mainstream of scholarly activity. The Renwick Gallery of the National Collection of Fine Arts, our museum-without-a-collection, continued to make imaginative use of objects from the collections of the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology in illuminating exhibitions on the subject of design. The establishment in the Museum of History and Technology of the Dwight D. Eisen-

<<<Page: 156>>>

hower Institute for Historical Research, and the appointment of Dr. Forrest Pogue, the distinguished biographer of General George C. Marshall, as its first director is the result of happy and fruitful collaboration between that museum and our National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board. With the cooperation of the National Portrait Gallery, the Archives of American Art will soon be able to open an exhibition gallery in the Old Patent Office building, allowing the public to see for the first time some of the treasures in its vast documentary collections. These developments, none of which is likely to earn headlines, are evidence that the varied entities that compose the Smithsonian Institution have the will and the means to work together toward a common purpose.
We must now duly note, on the other hand, that the past year did not lack its share — indeed, perhaps more than its share — of dramatic events.
After what seemed to be years of delay and frustration, the General Services Administration declared that the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden was “substantially complete.” The difference between this somewhat mysterious technical determination and the existence of a museum ready for the public is considerable; the first three months of the next year will be a time of unceasing activity for the museum’s staff and the Institution’s support facilities.
The closing months of the past year also saw the accomplishment of a major part of what must surely be the largest shipment of art in the history of this country. With remarkable smoothness, at least from the point of view of one observing with admiration from some distance, the great Hirshhorn collections of sculpture and painting were moved from various sites in New York City and Connecticut to their home in and about the museum and sculpture garden on the Mall.
This was also the year in which the Museum of History and Technology gained a new director, and the Institution shared in the reflected glory of its first Pulitzer Prize. The prize winner was Daniel Boorstin, for The Democratic Experience, the concluding volume of his trilogy The Americans. Upon becoming a Senior Historian, Dr. Boorstin was succeeded in the directorship of the Museum of History and Technology by Dr. Brooke Hindle, a distinguished historian of early American science and technology. An outstanding scholar who has long been associated with museums, and whose university experience includes service as a departmental chairman and a dean, Dr.

Hindle brings to his new position the experience, the talents, and the — enthusiasm required for the directorship of the world’s most visited museum.
The geographical scope of the Smithsonian was expanded during the past year by the opening of the West Coast regional center of the Archives of American Art. These centers, which now exist in Detroit, New York, Boston, and San Francisco serve both as regional research centers in which scholars may have access on microfilm to the entire holdings of the Archives, and as the foci of the Archives national collecting program. Often housed in contributed space — we are indebted to the DeYoung Museum for the new center — and staffed by only two or three people, these centers have an extraordinarily positive effect on the study of the history of American art in their regions.
After many years of activity behind the scenes, carried forward with the generous support of the Congress, the Smithsonian’s program of activities for the Bicentennial of the American Revolution produced its first public manifestation in 1974: the exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery entitled “In the Minds and Hearts of the People — Prologue to the American Revolution: 1760-1774.” Enthusiastically reviewed by the press, and editorially commended by The Washington Post, this exhibit is the first in a series of exhibits, publications, and festivals with which the Institution will mark our Nation’s two-hundredth birthday. It is also pleasant to be able to report here that the National Collection of Fine Arts, which had suffered patiently the inconveniences of subway construction outside its walls for several years, now enjoys once again the use of all its galleries and of its front door. With the reinstallation of the Lincoln Gallery, and the completion of galleries for miniatures and nonAmerican works, the NcFa is now able to show its collections and to mount temporary exhibitions more appropriately and handsomely than ever before.
In short, then, the past year has been one of steady growth punctuated by occasional, dramatic leaps forward. Between milestones — such as the fiftieth anniversary of the Freer Gallery last year, the opening of the Hirshhorn Museum next year, and the expected opening of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum the year after — the real progress takes place.
Finally, we must sorrowfully record the death during the past year

Each ' will be remembered by the Smithsonian and by the public for hercontributions to our collections and museums.
Archives of American Art
With five regional offices in full operation for the first time, the Archives experienced an unusually active year in both acquisitions and use of its resources. Among the larger and more significant col_lections of papers received were those of the New York sculptor | Paul Burlin, the painters Frank Duveneck, Barry Faulkner, and Henry Varnam Poor, the painter and designer Gyorgy Kepes, and | the Detroit collector Hawkins Ferry. Records of three major art galleries — Doll and Richards in Boston and the Rose Fried and | Maynard Walker Galleries in New York — were also accessioned. | The work of Walter Heil, Douglas MacAgy, and Alan Solomon, all nationally prominent administrators and exhibition organizers, is ' reflected in large groups of personal and professional papers. Insti| tutional records made available for microfilming by the Archives | included those of the Cranbrook Academy and the Allen Memorial | Museum in Oberlin, Ohio.
Three particularly interesting smaller groups of papers are a long series of letters from Alfred Stieglitz to Arthur Dove, written in the | 1920s and 1930s; 15 Maurice Prendergast letters to a friend and | collector, Mrs. Oliver Williams, and a diary kept by the New York _ dealer William Macbeth in the 1870s and 1880s. ’ Thirteen hundred calls for documentation offered by the Archives | were made by visiting researchers at all regional offices, an increase of one hundred over fiscal 1973 in spite of several weeks of interrup_ tion in service in the New York office. Over a thousand letters of _ inquiry were answered and 520 rolls of microfilm were lent out | through interlibrary loan. The latter figure represents a 25-percent _ increase over the previous year.
_ The Archives’ New York office underwent a major renovation in the fall and held an opening reception, with a display of documents, in its new quarters on the ground floor at 41 East 65th Street, in lateNovember 1973. Another display of documents was arranged in
History and Art / 145

<<<Page: 160>>>

March 1974 in connection with a reception held to explain the —
Archives to New York art dealers. An exhibition of letters from Fitzwilliam Sargent containing passages on the growth and education of his son John Singer Sargent was displayed at the Washington office.
The Archives Oral History Program continued its activities during the year. Twenty-one interviews with artists were taped and 33 tapes were transcribed. A grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, received in December, will enable the Archives to work off a backlog of 165 untranscribed tapes. As an aid to researchers, the Archives published a descriptive guide to 306 transcripts of interviews conducted between 1958 and 1971.
The Archives was the subject of three articles, one written by Russell Lynes and published in American Heritage; one by David Sokol published in Art in America, November-December 1973; and a third by Garnett McCoy published in Manuscripts, Summer 1974. In addition, 32 books, articles, and exhibition catalogues published during the year acknowledged assistance from Archives resources. Among these were James R. Mellow, Charmed Circle; June L. Ness, Lyonel Feininger; Richard G. Coker, Portrait of an American Painter: Edward Gay; Marguerite Zorach, The Early Years, 1908-1920 (National Collection of Fine Arts); Robert Loftin Newman (National Collection of Fine Arts); Vorticism and Its Allies (Arts Council of Great Britain); and Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of American Art).

Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design
Renovation activity has begun at the Carnegie Mansion and the first
_ phase should be completed by July of 1975. The collections and exhi-
bitions will be installed and the Museum will reopen to the public in the winter of 1975-1976.
During the past year the Museum organized a major exhibition of over 300 drawings, textiles, and wallpapers entitled “The Art of Decoration: Drawings and Objects from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum” at the Brooklyn Museum. A lecture series was given by the staff in conjunction with this exhibition. A second exhibition, of Winslow Homer drawings, was shown at the Columbia Museum of Art and the Telfair Academy in Savannah. In addition, objects from the collection were included in exhibitions at 23 institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery of Art, Baltimore Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy, Princeton University, Harvard University, Amherst College, Rice University, Finch College, and Pratt Institute. Exhibitions of nineteenth-century American drawings and new acquisitions in textiles were shown briefly in the Carnegie Mansion.
The collections were enriched by 671 items. The most outstanding gifts were the “Martin Scrapbook” containing samples of eighteenthcentury French block-printed fabrics and Indian chintzes, a gouache

drawing by Gino Severini, 8 nineteenth-century colored engravings of political cartoons, a nineteenth-century American cast-iron mantel, 2 cast-iron baluster panels designed by George G. Elmslie, a fashion drawing by Erté, 2 wallpapered folding screens, a collection of turn-of-the-century embroideries and embroidered samplers from the Eva Johnston Coe Collection. A total of 1562 objects were catalogued and 280 costumes were sent to the Smithsonian in Washington on long-term loan.
The William H. Goodyear collection of architectural photographs was transferred to the Cooper-Hewitt Library from the National Museum of History and Technology. John Maximus gave another portion (1919 items) of his classified pictorial reference library. The Color and Light Archive was enlarged with a gift of 1293 items on color by Mrs. I. H. Godlove.
A beginning was made toward the formulation of an Environmental Design collection dealing with the processes of design — how design has been influenced by natural, technological, and cultural forces, how it affects the human being physically and psychologically, and how it shapes landscapes and lifestyles. A meeting of 40 leading architects, designers, planners, and educators was held to advise on the development of this collection.
The Museum is presently conducting a study to determine the kinds of information designers need, the format of such an information system, and its use by professionals and the public. In order to facilitate research and to save wear and tear on fragile objects, a color slide catalogue of the collections was begun. This project has been generously supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, New York State Council, and the Mary Duke Biddle Trust. Slides of over 6500 items have been made to date, as well as a slide kit of embroideries. An anonymous gift was received to make a prototype film on traditional crafts in danger of disappearing.
A series of lectures entitled, ‘“The Fin de Siecle Medici: Carnegie and the Designer” was held in the Carnegie Mansion. Billy Baldwin, the famous New York interior designer, gave 4 lectures on ‘’Decorating Today.” Five lectures and a colloquium were given for the membership and 19 additional lectures were given by curators at other museums. The children’s workshops continued, and a tour was organized to see the furnishings and windows for Louis Comfort Tiffany’s famous chapel in the workshop where they are being restored.

Three members of the curatorial staff, Elaine Evans Dee, Milton — Sonday, and Catherine Lynn Frangiamore, received foundation grants for research outside of the Museum. Mrs. Frangiamore’s book on wallpapers used in America will be published by Praeger next spring. The staff was enlarged by two: Dorothy Twining Globus, who joined the Museum’s permanent exhibition staff, and Arete Swartz, from the Victoria and Albert Museum, who worked in the education department on a one-year grant. Twenty scholars studied the collections, and 7 student interns received training. Special lectures were given for visiting classes from New York University, City University of New York, the Art Students League, Pratt Institute, and Yale University.
The Museum held an extremely successful benefit auction under the chairmanship of Mrs. H. J. Heinz II. All of the items were donated expressly for the sale by collectors, dealers, and other friends of the Museum. A total of $125,000 was raised for the building fund. Grants were received from the Charles Hayden Foundation, Janet Neff Charitable Trust, Maya Corporation, Elsie de Wolfe Foundation, and New York Community Trust, and an additional $72,000 was raised, largely from corporations and individual designers for a Study Center in memory of Doris and Henry Dreyfuss.
Freer Gallery of Art
During fiscal year 1974 the Freer Gallery of Art celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. To mark that occasion, the Gallery presented three special exhibitions: “Japanese Ukiyoe Painting,” ““Chinese Figure Painting,” and “Ceramics from the World of Islam.” The Gallery published illustrated catalogues for each exhibition and organized international symposia devoted to analysis of the three different themes. Approximately 200 scholars and students participated in each of the three programs. These anniversary activities and publications, which focused on the arts of the Far and Near East, summarized a half century of acquisitions and research.
On May 2, 1973, the Freer Medal was presented to the Japanese specialist, Professor Tanaka Ichimatsu; on September 17, 1973, the recipient was the noted museologist and historian of Chinese art,

Mr. Laurence Sickman; and on January 16, 1974, the award was given to the renowned Near Eastern scholar, Professor Roman Ghirshman. The three men were honored as recipients of the Freer Medal for their “distinguished contribution to the knowledge and understanding of Oriental civilizations as reflected in their arts.”
Construction of a specially designed X-ray room and installation of initial X-ray equipment will enable the Freer Conservation Laboratory to keep pace with its steadily increasing activities. This essential equipment will considerably facilitate the examination of objects in the Collection and those being considered for study or purchase. In addition, two X-ray diffraction cameras and tracks will be used to identify pigments and corrosion products.
In the course of fiscal 1974, the Collection has expanded by the accession of 36 objects. Of those, several fine items were acquired by gift from the estates of Mrs. Agnes E. Meyer and Mr. Myron Bement Smith. Other objects of importance were presented by Mrs. Anna Chennault and Mr. Yoichi Nakajima.
Harold P. Stern, Director, participated in the seventh meeting of the United States-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange in Tokyo on June 17-20. Thomas Lawton, Assistant Director, and W. Thomas Chase III, Head Conservator, were among
the 12 members of the American Art and Archaeology Delegation who visited the People’s Republic of China from November 10 ! through December 9, 1973.
_ Special exhibitions at the Freer Gallery were “Turkish Art of the Ottoman Period” (August 1, 1973, through December 19, 1973), “Chinese Figure Painting” (September 11, 1973, through November 30, 1973), and “Ceramics from the World of Islam” (January 17, 1974, through June 30, 1974).
Rutherford J. Gettens joined the staff of the Freer Gallery of Art on October 1, 1951.During the more than 20 years of his association with the Gallery, he was instrumental in establishing the Technical Laboratory and in maintaining its high level of research. His publications on problems relating to pigment analysis and on the fabrication of Chinese bronze vessels achieved an international reputation for him and the Laboratory. After his retirement in 1968, Mr. Gettens remained active in the position of Research Consultant. His unexpected death on June 17, 1974, at the age of 74, is an irreplaceable loss.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
The public opening of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden
is scheduled for October 1, 1974.
Final plans were developed for the inaugural exhibition, utilizing scale models, photographic aids, and full-scale mock-ups in styrofoam of monumental pieces of sculpture, to help determine placement of works in the outdoor sculpture garden and plaza.
Production was completed on postcards, reproductions, and color slides illustrating outstanding works from the Collection which will be available to the public in the Museum shop.
It was a year marked by the transfer of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMsc) offices and personnel from New York to temporary quarters in the Arts and Industries Building in July 1973; and then to the new building on December 27, 1973. Beneficial occupancy of the new Museum was accepted by the Smithsonian on March 29, 1974.
On April 17, 1974, title to the extensive collections included in the Agreement of May 17, 1966, passed from Mr. Joseph H. Hirshhorn to the Smithsonian Institution. This action was immediately
followed by implementation of previously established plans for
moving the Collection.
The substantial task of moving the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden collections to Washington, D.C., from various points including New York City, Greenwich, Connecticut, and Toronto, Canada, was commenced on April 14, 1974. The move was accomplished on schedule, with pieces in the opening exhibition being in
the vanguard in order to permit the Exhibits and Design staff to |
begin the installation.
In 1974 the inaugural book/catalogue went to press. This 750|
page volume includes 1001 paintings and sculptures which are docu-
mented and reproduced — 296 in color. The foreword is by S. Dillon | Ripley, Secretary of the Smithsonian, with an introduction by |
Abram Lerner, Director of the Hirshhorn Museum, and essays by | six Outstanding art scholars. These complement the selected com-— mentaries and historical data, and make up a scholarly and stimulat|
ing volume. A souvenir booklet, An Introduction to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, is also in production.
Looking beyond the Museum’s opening, research was begun on _

the program of future exhibitions. A series of research exhibitions were planned, as well as a program for research fellows. In fiscal year 1974, too, documentation and cataloguing of the permanent collection progressed.
During this period the staff paused to mourn the passing of two dedicated individuals who contributed greatly to the planning and development of the Museum’s programs: On March 2, 1974, the staff was saddened to hear of the death of Miss Elisabeth Houghton, a member of the Museum’s Board of Trustees and a lifelong champion of civic causes. She was one of the original members of the Board, having been appointed by President Nixon in 1971. On September 6, 1973, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden lost the invaluable collaboration of Mr. Douglas MacAgy, who supervised the preliminary design of our inaugural exhibition. Mr. MacAgy’s contribution was outstanding and his previous experience with the National Endowment for the Arts was of great help in our initial planning.
The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has been most successful in recruiting qualified and outstanding personnel in the professional field to fill new positions, and to replace those who have left our ranks: The Board of Trustees, at their April 4, 1974, meeting, voted to appoint Miss Anne d’Harnoncourt to the Board for a term expiring in 1980. At this meeting the Honorable Daniel P. Moynihan was reelected Chairman, and Dr. George Heard Hamilton was reelected Vice Chairman.
The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden staff was augmented by the following appointments: Stephen E. Weil, Deputy Director; Charles W. Millard, Chief Curator; Charles Froom, Installation Designer; Edward Lawson, Chief, Education Program; Mary Ann Tighe, Education Specialist; and Douglas Robinson, Registrar.
“Inside the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,” a special series of lectures on the Museum and its collections began on January 21, 1974, with a talk by the Director on “Joseph H. Hirshhorn, Collector.” This series, begun at the request of the Resident Associates program, had an enrollment of thirty-eight subscribers. Its nine lectures included a talk on the installation of the Inaugural Exhibition by Charles Froom, Installation Designer, and Cynthia McCabe discussing the content of the opening exhibition. Other talks included

The Museum continued to respond to requests and inquiries from scholars and researchers and maintained its policy of lending outstanding works of art to national and international exhibitions. More than 235 requests for research information were answered by the Department of Painting and Sculpture. Fifty paintings and sculptures were loaned to 25 museums, galleries, and institutions.
The Alberto Giacometti Retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, from April 5 to June 23, 1974, included the sculpture “Seated Women” from the Hirshhorn Museum Collections. Other artists whose works have been borrowed for exhibitions in Spring 1974 are: Karl Knaths (International Exhibitions Foundation, Washington, D.C., tour); Zoltan Kemeny (Foundation Maeght, Paris); Horace Pippin (Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington); Jacob Lawrence (Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and tour); and Mark Tobey (National Collection of Fine Arts, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
Among recent volumes which reproduced paintings and sculpture from the Collections are: American Masters: The Voice and the Myth by Brian O’Doherty (New York, Random House), Elie Nadelman by Lincoln Kirstein (New York, Eakins Press), Grandma Moses by Otto Kallir (New York, Harry N. Abrams), and Henry Moore in America by Henry J. Seldis (New York, Praeger).
Formal training sessions for 75 volunteer docents were begun by the Hmsc Education Department on January 15, 1974, to continue thru May 28, to be followed by an intensive training period in the Museum galleries. The training course is made up of slide lectures and demonstratioins, and will involve extensive work in the galleries with the paintings and sculpture.
The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s Board of Trustees is made up of the following members:
Daniel P. Moynihan, Chairman Theodore E. Cummings George Heard Hamilton, Vice Chairman Anne d’Harnoncourt H. Harvard Arnason Taft B. Schreiber Leigh B. Block Hal B. Wallis

Joseph Henry Papers
The research and editing for the second volume of The Papers of Joseph Henry are now very close to completion. The volume, documenting Henry’s career from the end of 1832 through 1835, will introduce Henry to his new environment at Princeton, follow his activities as Professor of Natural Philosophy at the College of New Jersey, and detail the resumption of his electrical research, mainly on self-induction. One of the highlights of the volume will be an extensive run of documents from the first of three laboratory notebooks kept by Henry at Princeton and the Smithsonian, and now preserved in the Smithsonian Archives. The notebooks reflect the pace and style of Henry’s daily research as well as the evolution of his scientific ideas over several decades. The documents in the second volume also portray the dramatic expansion of Henry’s scientific role and associations during his early Princeton years, while shedding new light on scientific centers like Philadelphia.
While the regular collecting and research activities of the project go on, preparations are now being made for seeing the second volume through the Smithsonian Press and for the editing of volume three of our series, documenting, among other events in Henry’s life, his 1837 trip to Europe. His diary from that journey, marking Henry’s formal introduction to the international science scene, provides an extraordinary record of transatlantic communication in science. Plans are also underway for the editing of a special volume of lectures and essays by Joseph Henry, based upon manuscripts from throughout his career. It is hoped that this special volume, treating topics such as Henry’s philosophy of science, will appeal to a wide audience, both scholarly and popular, and will perhaps be found suitable for classroom use at the college and graduate levels.
Significant progress was also made in organizing and cataloguing the Joseph Henry Library, Henry’s personal reference collection. A wide-ranging collection with numerous rare volumes, the Library is an invaluable resource for appreciating Henry’s scientific development and scientific literature of the day. Plans are now going forward to publish an annotated catalogue of the collection for the general use of historians.
The project continues to sponsor and participate in various Smith-

sonian educational activities. Visiting scholars continued to exploit the Henry Papers’ collections and resources. Nathan Reingold’s seminar on the nineteenth century had another successful year.
National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board
With the approval of the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board, the Smithsonian Institution entered into a cooperative agreement with the Department of the Interior. The agreement provides a basis upon which the Smithsonian may fulfill its responsibilities under the Act of August 30, 1961 (75 Stat. 414, 20 USC 80-80d). Under the agreement the two agencies may work jointly in advancing outdoor museum programs, short term and long term, to illuminate historical American attitudes toward matters of national defense and past contributions by the Armed Forces to American society and culture.
Representatives of the National Park Service and the staff of the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board pursued planning for a special Bicentennial program to dramatize the spirit of the American people in the struggle for independence. The program is to be presented to the public at Washington, D. C., during the summer of 1976. It will portray the life of the citizen-soldier of the American Revolution through the medium of living history. The program will take place out of doors.
The National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board at the close of fiscal year 1974 consisted of the following members.
The Honorable John Nicholas Brown, Chairman The Honorable Earl Warren
Secretary of Army
Secretary of Navy
Secretary of Air Force
Lieutenant General Milton G. Baker, Retired Robert C. Baker

National Collection of Fine Arts
All of the activity of the National Collection of Fine Arts (NcFA) is directed toward educational goals — if enjoyment and appreciation can be included with the pursuit and refinement of knowledge as part of artistic education. Although some 1556 paintings, sculptures, and graphic works were added to the Collection this year (the Collection now numbers about 17,000), and study continues to refine the computerized listings and to improve accessibility, collecting is only one aspect of a complex program. Since the museum believes that the circumstances under which a work of art is encountered has much to do with an awareness of its qualities, great effort has been made to present each of the over 900 works from the collection now on display to its best advantage for the modern viewer. This has required, in addition to a continuing conservation and reframing program, the careful design of each area to create not a synthetic historical past but a convincing artistic present. This year the totally reorganized Lincoln Gallery was reopened, the Doris M. Magowan Gallery of Portrait Miniatures was completed, and a new gallery was established for some of the museum’s other-than-American works, including a fine Rubens and a recently identified Guercino.
Including the Renwick Gallery, about 78,000 square feet of gallery space is now open to the public. Part of that space is reserved for temporary exhibitions which carry out the ncra’s concern for the reexamination of little-known aspects of American art as well as occasional tribute to acknowledged masters. Of the 21 exhibitions planned and produced by the staff this year (in all, 25 were presented) some were studies of individual artists ranging from the less well known including Margarite Zorach and Herman Webster to the distinguished ceramists Gertrude and Otto Natzler and the eminent painter Mark Tobey. Especially popular was an exhibition of drawings on Smithsonian letterhead made by Saul Steinberg while in residence at the Smithsonian in 1967. Investigating special themes were such exhibitions as “A Measure of Beauty,” “Shaker,” and “Art of the Pacific Northwest from the 1930s to the Present.” As one in a series calling attention to artistic quality in works from other Smithsonian Collections, ‘Boxes and Bowls” was mounted at the Renwick Gallery, affording “a new look at historical works from several Northwest Coast Indian groups.

monographs or smaller catalogues, were issued in association with almost all exhibitions.
Exhibitions from abroad shown at the Renwick Gallery included paintings from Pakistan and a retrospective of two hundred years of Royal Copenhagen porcelain. Ten exhibitions provided by the National Collection were in circulation to other countries during the year, among them “Made in Chicago” (works by Chicago artists) | which traveled through South America and “Fabric Vibrations,” an exhibition originating at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, which circulated in Southeast Asia, carrying the modern craft of tie dye to its ancient home.
The many established activities for making the museum accessible to a wide public continued with an expanded Department of Education. Young visitors expressed pleasure with the new children’s gallery, “Explore.” Students continued with the Discover Graphics program and a group of high-school-age “junior interns” enlivened many activities of the museum. Education of a different kind was carried on by six doctoral fellows and two senior fellows engaged in research on American art. To such scholars, NcFa’s rapidly expanding Bicentennial Inventory of American Painting before 1914 will be of great help when ready for use in 1976. The National Col-] lection of Fine Arts joined with the University of Delaware in th spring to organize a symposium on late nineteenth-century American art. Throughout the museum during the year were university] students learning the various processes of museum operation as] interns, helping to keep the entire staff aware that learning and} teaching go hand in hand.

National Museum of History and Technology
On January 23, 1974, the National Museum of History and Technology entered its second decade. Marking its tenth anniversary, Chief Justice and Smithsonian Chancellor Warren Burger with Secretary Ripley named the Museum’s auditorium in memory of Leonard Carmichael, the Secretary whose vision and determination had brought about the planning, approval, and construction of this Museum. At the Museum’s dedication 10 years earlier, President Lyndon Johnson had expressed his belief that “this Museum will do that which causes us all to celebrate; it will excite a thirst for knowledge among all people.” Since its founding, the National Museum of History and Technology has welcomed nearly 55 million visitors. Yearly attendance has grown steadily, now reaching 7 million per year. Last April, visitor attendance topped the million mark, making — the highest monthly attendance ever registered in a Smithsonian building. Attendance is expected to be vastly increased during our — second decade as the Nation carries out its Bicentennial celebrations. —
On the first of October 1973, Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin moved from the directorship of the Museum to the post of Senior Historian in the National Museum of History and Technology, a position which allows him to devote more of his energies to research and writing. © In May 1974, Dr. Boorstin received the Pulitzer Prize for History | for The Americans: The Democratic Experience, the final volume in his trilogy on the American people. The writing of this volume had been completed during the four years of his directorship.
Dr. Boorstin’s successor, Professor Brooke Hindle, was appointed after nomination by museum curators and began his tenure in February. A faculty member of the New York University since 1950, his two most recent posts have been as Dean of the University College of Arts and Science and Head of the University Department of History. Known for his distinctive works, The Pursuit of Science in Revolutionary America 1735-1785; David Rittenhouse: A Biography; and Technology in America: Needs and Opportunities, Dr. Hindle is presently editing a volume which summarizes the conference he planned for Sleepy Hollow Restorations on ‘America’s © Wooden Age.” His present research assesses the role of industrial © fairs in advancing the technology of their time. His particular focus . has been the Centennial Exposition of 1876 — from which the |

Smithsonian Institution drew its first significant holdings of! machinery and technological artifacts, now housed in this Museum.
Several series of public lectures were continued from last year with considerable success as an important form of contact with the: visiting public and outreach to the Washington community. The: National Museum of History and Technology in its second series of | Frank Nelson Doubleday Lectures considered “Creativity and Col-: laboration,” looking at the special opportunities and pressures of | our age to collaborate, and asking how particular collaborations — in industry, scientific research, the media, city planning, and govern-. ment — had affected creativity and brought about growth and! change. Speakers were Japanese industrialist Akio Morita, President : and co-founder of Sony Corporation; Nobel Prize-winning biologist | James Dewey Watson, whose collaboration with Francis Crick | resulting in an understanding of DNA was heralded as one of the most dramatic research breakthroughs of modern times; British Broadcasting Corporation’s Managing Director of Television Huw Wheldon; Israeli-born Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, designer of Habitat; and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar. W. Weinberger. Each lecturer also took part in a luncheon seminar, allowing for an open exchange of ideas among curators, the lecturer, and special guests. Doubleday and Company has renewed its grant for a third year of lectures in “The Frontiers of Knowledge” series. |
The Museum also continued a series of lectures with the U.S. Postal Service relating to new postage stamp issues. Extremely | popular lectures included “The Continental Congresses” and ‘Rise of the Spirit of Independence.” First Day ceremonies were held for the block of eight 10-cent stamps commemorating the Universal Postal Union Centennial.
In addition to these evening lectures, the Museum has provided, since last January, weekly daytime Museum Talks by curators and qualified museum aides, technicians, and specialists. When moved
from Saturdays to Tuesdays at lunchtime, these slide talks have drawn large audiences both of Museum visitors, neighboring government employees, and Museum staff. The lectures reflect both the Museum’s varied collections and current staff research projects. Some of the most exciting presentations have included demonstrations of historic objects front our collections, from the early soundamplifying devices of inventor Elisha Gray, a contemporary of

The primary efforts of all staff during the past year have been
spent in readying the National Museum of History and Technology’s five major exhibitions for the Bicentennial period. The first, opening this coming September 20th on the lower level, is an exhibition on the two-hundred-year history of American clothing. “Suiting Everyone,” the story of America’s transition from homespun or tailormade garments to ready-to-wear, is an interdisciplinary exhibit, bringing together the Division of Costume and Furnishings, whose costume collection was greatly enriched by a massive clothing appeal this year; the Division of Textiles, which offers the machines and textiles of manufacture; and the Division of Military History, which has supplied examples of early mass-produced clothing — soldiers’ uniforms. A major new installment of the National Museum of History and Technology’s political history wing is scheduled for opening the middle of next year. The theme of “A Nation of Nations,” pluralism in American life, is particularly suited to this ‘Museum, which has become the repository for many thousands of artifacts which were family heirlooms, treasured possessions, and creations of American people of every ethnic, racial, and religious origin.Considerable staff attention was directed to restoration work on the exhibition “1876 — A Centennial,” an exciting project which will transform a portion of the Arts and Industries Building into a microcosm of the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 capturing the festive and optimistic spirit of America on its one-hundredth birthday. This exhibit will manifest the exuberance of a Victorian extravaganza, an atmosphere of organized chaos, with all spaces dominated by an enormous variety of material objects. Finally, Vladimir and Elvira Clain-Stefanelli, Curators of the Division of Numismatics, are preparing a special exhibition on the history of American banks and banking, supported by the American Bankers Association, to open in September of 1975.
This year the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research, a study and conference center which will make important contributions to national study and evaluation of the Armed Forces, their importance in war and in maintaining peace, was brought to full realization with the appointment of Dr. Forrest C. Pogue, Direc-

tor of the George C. Marshall Research Library in Lexington, Virginia, and widely known biographer of George Marshall, to the directorship of the new Institute.
As part of the Institution’s overall decentralization program, the National Museum of History and Technology assumed the administration of its own Office of Exhibits and Building Management Division. From the Smithsonian’s decentralization of the Office of Primary and Secondary Education has come a new approach to the Museum’s education responsibilities, which have been formalized in a new Division of Public Information and Education. In addition to conducting tours and developing visitor programs, the Office will establish a visitor center on the Museum’s first floor to orient the visitor and answer public inquiries. This past year a staff associate was hired to adapt museum exhibits and activities to the needs of the handicapped. The staff associate, being herself handicapped, concentrated her efforts on developing tours for the blind and deaf with great success. Experiments were conducted with Braille labels and subtitled films, and the results will be incorporated into future exhibit planning. Alice Reno joined the staff in late spring as Supervisor of the Division.
And on a playful note, the National Museum of History and Technology displayed in each public restroom an exhibit panel tracing with graphics the history of “Bathrooms in America.” It leaves visitors contemplating the chamber pot and closestool of earlier days, with a sense of the full impact of technology on the American way of life.
Locating and collecting objects and memorabilia for Bicentennial exhibitions was by far the dominating activity of the Museum’s staff this past year as progress continues simultaneously on four major subject exhibitions.
The Division of Costume and Furnishings initiated an unusual collecting effort for the exhibit, “Suiting Everyone,” utilizing a news release and list of items needed for display. The response was overwhelming, resulting in the acquisition of a large number of items of clothing from 1920 to 1970 that ranged from representative clothing worn by the majority of Americans to examples produced by the industry’s greatest designers.
The preparation of the exhibition has benefited enormously. from the valuable assistance provided by a panel of advisors from the

Rearrangement of the reference collections of the Division of Textiles has resulted in more adequate storage of the Division’s extensive collections of quilts, samplers, and rugs, making them more accessible to the staff and visiting students and scholars.

fashion community. Given the incredible breadth of the Smithsonian | collections and the interdisciplinary perspective gained from the © participating Museum staff, the exhibit promises to have a profound ©
impact on the future study of American clothing and its industry.
The full staff of the Division of Political History devoted its |
major effort to the forthcoming exhibition hall to be entitled “We,
the People.” They have been engrossed in the challenging task of } selecting and acquiring objects illustrating the role of American }
government in the lives of the American people. Objects have been
collected from resources within the Museum as well as from other | Smithsonian and Federal agencies. Conservation of the First Ladies’ }
Gowns also continued, bringing the total number of First Lady patterns now completed to twenty. In cooperation with the Division of Textiles, the skirt of the dress of Martha Washington was
restored as the first project in a long-term program for the conserva-
tion and restoration of the First Ladies’ Gowns. As part of this program, Barbara Coffee, Museum Specialist in this Division, received a grant from the Secretary’s fund to explore costume preservation and restoration being done in museums in England, The Netherlands, and in Sweden.
The new Henry R. Luce Hall of News Reporting continued to draw enthusiastic crowds, and plans are now underway by the Smithsonian to produce a film and a traveling exhibit based on the Hall. Two exhibitions have been shown in the Hall’s Print Gallery: “Prang’s American Chromos,” showing the step-by-step production of a twenty-six color lithograph; and “Anatomy of a Gallop,” a comparison between the lithographs by Currier and Ives of racing horses and the contemporary photographs by Muybridge of the same subject.
The Division of Medical Sciences devoted considerable effort to the preparation of the exhibit “Triumph Over Disability” in the Hall of Health. The exhibit was made possible by a grant from the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Each Friday, films and lectures on the subject are offered in the Leonard Carmichael Auditorium.
Several major exhibits were closed and dismantled this past year in preparation for Bicentennial activities. This necessitated the removal and temporary storage of thousands of valuable objects, a project that required the involvement of more than half the Mu-

seum’s divisions and staff. The ““Growth of the United States,” “Art and Spirit of a People,” “American Costume,” and “Historic Americans” were among the halls closed, as well as the special exhibits “Music Machines” and “A Children’s World.”
Several large objects were removed to other more visible areas, including the relocation of the John Bull locomotive. Granite blocks, especially cut for the purpose, support pieces of the original rail used in 1831 under the engine.
The main focus of attention for “1876: A Centennial Exhibit” is upon the restoration of objects and cases of the period that will be utilized within the displays. The restoration and refurbishing of those objects that were displayed nearly one hundred years ago, for which a unique restoration task force has been organized within the Museum, are proceeding on a scale unprecedented in the history of the Institution.
Since that facet of the Centennial which had the largest public impact was the overwhelming array of machinery and power equipment, the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering has a primary involvement in it. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Heavy Machinery and Civil Engineering, is co-curator in charge, and Edwin A. Battison, Curator of Light Machinery, has responsibility for the machine-tool exhibits.
The practicality of the exhibition was founded primarily upon the vast collection of Centennial memorabilia carefully preserved and housed in many parts of the Institution. The machinery and models will form the nucleus of the exhibition, supplemented by other fine examples of the types exhibited at the Philadelphia Exposition.
For many months, members of the staff have traveled to record centers, archives, and libraries, conducting research, recording and photographing available documentary evidence in support of the present restoration. Factories and industrial firms on the verge of demolition have been contacted in an effort to locate furnishings and fittings so very vital to achieving the atmosphere of 1876.
Restoration of this equipment is being performed in three separate shops created for this purpose under the general supervision of William K. Henson, Supervisor of the Science and Technology Department’s Technical Laboratory.
The main facility, headed by Museum Specialist Charles E. Dennison, is responsible for the restoration of machinery such as ma-

chine tools, fittings, and steam engines of sizes that can be accommo|
dated in the basement shops of the Museum. Here, objects are first disassembled, marked, chemically cleaned, and restored to original condition with close adherence to all available published references and illustrations. All broken parts are repaired, and missing parts are duplicated to permit each object to not only look but perform as new.
Machines and tools too large and cumbersome for the in-house shop are restored at a newly created second facility at Silver Hill
under the supervision of Museum Technician William T. Tearman.
A shop on the fifth floor of the National Museum of History and Technology serves as the third restoration facility for relatively small objects, at present principally a selection of the hundreds of patent models exhibited at the Philadelphia Fair, and the cutting and sewing of small intricate sails for many of the ship models.
One of the most interesting phases of the work that has spread excitement throughout the entire staff has been that concerned with the stripping of layers of decorative paint and the detective work necessary to repaint and decorate the finished items. An example is the Linde-Wolk steam engine recently acquired by the Institution from the American Brewery in Baltimore, Maryland. When the Technical Laboratory personnel commenced their routine documentation
of the colors and designs applied to the engine over the years — |
stripping away each successive coat of paint, taking record photographs, and tracing the decorative patterns—they discovered among its dozen discrete layers of paint an intricate panorama of delicately shaded flowers and exquisite filigrees. While the notion of such painstaking art work on a huge industrial engine may now seem anomalous, in an earlier era it clearly was considered a proper adjunct. When completed, the engine will be repainted and decorated as it was many years ago.
To assist with the unprecedented workload imposed by the restoration program for “1876,” six additions were made to the crew; each new man boasts some specialized aptitude or skill essential to the successful consummation of the program. Among other individual projects are the refurbishment of a 42-foot span from a Howe truss bridge and a group of components salvaged from the Girard Avenue Bridge in Philadelphia — a bridge built at the time of the Centennial and dismantled a few years ago.

Research and work on furnishings and other phases of the exhibition are proceeding under the direction of Cultural History Curator Rodris Roth and Museum Technician Susan Myers. William Miner of the Office of Exhibits is overall coordinator of the project.
Highlighting the activities of the Division of Musical Instruments was a program produced for the Renwick Gallery entitled “American Music and Ballroom Dance, 1840-1860,” utilizing wind instruments and a Chickering piano of the period. Cynthia Hoover, James Weaver, and Robert Sheldon edited the music. Restoration projects completed included the production of measured drawings for the 1760 Stehlin harpsichord, preparation of wind instruments for the “American Music” performance, and work on a 1794 Broadwood grand piano. Thomas Wolf, keyboard instrument maker, joined the staff as the first participant in a two-year program for training of conservators of musical instruments, a service offered for the first time by the Institution and the only program of its kind in the country.
The Division of Numismatics was joint host, with the American Numismatic Society, of the 1973 International Numismatic Congress which met for the first time in the United States in September 1973. Opening in New York City, the Congress moved to Washington, where numerous papers were presented in the Museum to an attendance of 329 numismatists and guests representing 32 coun-
‘tries. A special exhibition of medals commemorating the battles of the American Revolution was produced by the Division with an
interpretative publication. A derivative of the Congress was a threevolume Survey of Numismatic Research, of which Mrs. Elvira ClainStefanelli was the editor of the section on medals.
In November, the Division of Naval History co-sponsored the American Meeting of the Society for the History of Discoveries in concert with the Library of Congress and the U.S. National Archives. Featured were sessions on the exploration of the Americas and on cartographic resources from the era of the American Revolution.
On May 30, the Secretary presented to Dr. Vladimir ClainStefanelli and to Mrs. Elvira Clain-Stefanelli the Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award “in recognition of the successful acquisition and display of the Josiah K. Lilly Collection of gold coins and their many other achievements and accomplishments in the numismatic world
and for their tireless devotion to the development of one of the

world’s finest numismatic collections.” In September, Dr. and Mrs. Clain-Stefanelli were awarded the 1973 Leonard Forrer Medal by the International Association of Professional Numismatists ‘for their work for the increase and diffusion of knowledge in the field of numismatics.”
Peter C. Marzio, Associate Curator of the Division of Graphic Arts, received a Fulbright Research Grant which enabled him to study nineteenth-century American artists in Rome during most of the past year. Bernard S. Finn, Curator of Electricity, spent a sabbatical leave in London where he helped prepare a special exhibition — and booklet on submarine telegraphy at The Science Museum, entitled “Leave It to the Mermaids,” in which technical developments were placed in their social context. The exhibit included objects from > a number of museums, the Smithsonian Institution, corporations and individuals in the United States as well as in Great Britain. Jon B. Eklund, Curator of Chemistry, was on a year’s leave of absence, during which he was Visiting Professor of Chemistry at the New York Historical Association at Cooperstown.
Another recipient of an award was Harold D. Langley, Curator of Naval History, who received a research grant for work in the col| lections of the American Antiquarian Society on early American flags and newspaper sources for American reaction to the Peace of Ghent in 1815. Robert M. Vogel, Curator of Mechanical and Civil : Engineering, conducted a week-long seminar at Cooperstown dealing with the techniques of field recording, photography, map inter| pretation, and site analysis relating to historic and industrial archeology. He also assisted in organizing a symposium celebrating the 250th Anniversary of the Carpenters’ Company of Philadelphia, “Building Early America,” presenting a paper on materials handling © and steam excavation. Senior Scientific Scholar Robert P. Multhauf | also participated in the conference as well as in a colloquium at the Burndy Library in Connecticut on the relationship between science | and technology. :
In December 1973, William Seale joined the staff as Curator in — the Division of Ethnic and Western Cultural History. His fields of | activity include the history of American architecture and the material culture of the south-central and southeastern United States during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He was co-author of a _ survey of the state capitol buildings of the United States. During the | year, three new chairmen were appointed to the Museum’s depart—

A large and important collec| tion of early photographic materials relating to the scientific investigations of Professor John W. Draper, one of the first American researchers to use photography as an investigative tool in scientific investigations, was also acquired.
A particularly valuable document, the original payroll of the Continental gondola Philadelphia, was received through the generosity of the Trustees of the Fort Concho Museum at San Angelo, Texas. This provides a new and human dimension to the history of this’ national treasure. Also received was a specialized group of East | Asian paper currencies containing several thousand Chinese notes.
Combined with the Oriental coins already owned by the Division of
Numismatics, these materials form one of the most important refer-_ ence collections for the student of Oriental monetary history. Among other significant items received were a rare eighteenth| century indigo blue glazed wool counterpane and a number of horse| drawn vehicles required to complete portions of the tranportation © collection, including a 1900 truck, an 1890 laundry wagon, a 1929 Cunningham touring car, and two horse-drawn cotton pickers. A_ fine collection of scales and balances was received from the City of © Baltimore, together with instruments from the National Weather Service. | Baseball and archery collections, which were acquired this past year, have developed a relatively new area of collection activity.

National Portrait Gallery
The year began with the opening on the Fourth of July of a major exhibition entitled ‘The Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution, 1770-1800,” which consisted of more than 250 items: paintings, prints, broadsides and books, documents and letters, and three-dimensional objects. Professor Sidney Kaplan of the University of Massachusetts prepared both the exhibition and its catalogue, a 270-page volume containing 100 black and white illustrations and 8 in color, published for the National Portrait Gallery (nrc) by the New York Graphic Society in association with the Smithsonian Institution Press. Professor Kaplan, who took a year’s leave of absence from his post at Amherst College to come to Washington, was the first of many scholars, experts in their fields, whom we hope to call upon in connection with special exhibitions and publications. ‘The Black Presence,” like all the Gallery’s major exhibitions, also was accompanied by an illustrated booklet and a teacher’s guide, prepared especially for the secondary-school level. This publication, 72 pages in length and illustrated with 50 reproductions, was written by the Associate Curator of Education, Mrs. Lisa W. Strick.
A two-gallery exhibition, mounted to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine on December 3, was organized by a member of the staff of the Catalog of American Portraits, Gerald Z. Levin, who also prepared its 128-page catalogue. The installations of this and “The Black Presence” exhibition were designed by Joseph Michael Carrigan, Chief of Exhibit Design and Production.
A small exhibition dealing with the presidential portraiture of Abraham Lincoln, centering on a full-length portrait of Lincoln by William F. Cogswell, lent by the White House, was prepared by two npc interns, Richard Beard and Kenneth Yellis, who spent a year with us under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Beard and Yellis, who received their Master’s Degrees in History from Emory University and the University of Rochester, respectively, were selected from nearly 100 candidates who applied for these internships designed to acquaint the recipients with various phases of work encountered in a history museum.
Several special portrait presentations also took place during the

year. The most notable of these was of a bust of President Lyndon B. Johnson by Jimilu Mason, an event at which Mrs. Johnson and Senator Hubert Humphrey spoke.
In the past twelve months, more than 33,000 adults and young people were served in the Gallery and in schoolrooms by our Education Department—an increase of 300 percent over last year.
The Historian’s Office and the Curatorial Department were mainly involved in the preparation of the first two in a series of the Gallery’s three Bicentennial exhibitions, “In the Minds and Hearts of the People: Prologue to the American Revolution, 17601774,” and “The Dye is Now Cast, 1774-1776.” The former, which opened on June 14, will be discussed in greater detail in next year’s report.

That this was a banner year for the Gallery in terms of acquisi-
tions to the permanent collection is evidenced by the addition of |
817 portraits, 761 of which were engravings by Charles Balthazar Julien Fevret de Saint-Mémin. Presented by Paul Mellon, this collection represents the most munificent benefaction received by the National Portrait Gallery since its inception. Originally owned by Saint-Mémin himself, these portraits, executed between 1796 and 1814, constitute a remarkably diverse representation of major figures of the early Federal Republic, including Presidents Washington, Jefferson, and Madison; Paul Revere; Aaron Burr; Ben-
jamin Rush; John Marshall; Charles Willson Peale; Stephen De--
catur; Mother Seton; Meriwether Lewis; and William Clark. Another important gift was a portrait of Richard Henry Lee by Charles Willson Peale, presented by Duncan C. Lee and his son Gavin Dunbar Lee. Most notable among the year’s acquisitions by purchase were the only known life portrait of the first Speaker of the House of Representatives Frederick Muhlenberg by Joseph Wright, Dolley Madison (at the age of 83) by William S. Elwell, a bust of Ralph Waldo Emerson by Daniel Chester French, a bronze relief of President Theodore Roosevelt executed from life in 1906 by Sally James Farnham, and a group of drawings by Soss Melik including likenesses of Sherwood Anderson, Cole Porter, and Thomas Wolfe.

Office of Academic Studies The Office of Academic Studies, under the direction of the Board of Academic Studies, conducts Smithsonian programs in higher education and research training. The foremost objective of the programs is to provide the framework within which each visiting oF ident and investigator can confront individually the opportunities for the pursuit of knowledge represented in the Smithsonian’s collections and its research and technical staff. In the arts, humanities, and sciences, students at all postsecondary levels study under the guidance of the Smithsonian’s professional research faculty.
Predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows undertake research training in their specialties, bringing in their inquiries great intellectual stimulation and adding immeasurably to the vitality of the research climate. Predoctoral fellows generally consult Smithsonian resources necessary to their dissertations but not available at their universities. Postdoctoral fellows, usually recent recipients of the doctorate, seek advanced research training and the opportunity to expand studies begun at the university. During the academic year 1973-1974, 21 predoctoral and 24 postdoctoral fellowships were awarded to support these activities in most of the museums, laboratories, and field stations of the Institution.
Five students, in an earlier stage of graduate study than the predoctoral fellows, have received fellowships supported jointly by their home universities and the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum to study aspects of the social and technological impact of space exploration. Although pursuing degrees in different disciplines at different Washington-area universities, the students worked with each other as well as their Smithsonian advisor in the development of their individual projects.
Fellowship appointments for directed research are provided for two to three months to graduate and undergraduate students, to offer them new perspectives on the purposes of research and to provide them access to sources and materials not encountered by them in their university-based studies. Some students pursue interests previously developed, but many explore areas of knowledge wholly new. For example, a summer spent at the Smithsonian might allow a first-year graduate student to reflect on the full range of alternatives in his chosen field of knowledge, and to de-

fine his future graduate course of study based on a better understanding of what he finds both practical and interesting. During) 1973-1974 such awards were made to 21 graduate and undergraduate students; 4 of the undergraduates were supported under a grant from the National Science Foundation.
Other students, often undergraduates, by preference undertake studies at the Smithsonian which provide broader exposure than) research training. They are participants in a program for museum) study, a program offering them a chance to learn in the working: museum or laboratory or field environment rather than the tradi| tional classroom atmosphere, to take part in the ongoing work. of the Institution while pursuing a project that interests and! challenges them. Most students in the program are awarded aca-demic credit by their home universities, where the student’s performance meets the educational standards set by the Smithsonian | and the standards and requirements imposed by the university. During the past year, 13 participated in museum-study projects under the close supervision of Smithsonian staff members.
In other undergraduate programs, two members of the Smith| sonian staff taught regular courses in their specialties in the University of Maryland’s program in the history of science and tech| nology.
Seeking other ways to encourage the interchange of ideas and. the exchange of information, Academic Studies supports visitors to the Institution for very brief periods of study, research, and. consultation with the staff. The range of purposes and levels of © accomplishment of these visitors reflect the diversity of the Smithsonian itself, for they may be graduate students or distinguished senior scholars and scientists, from the United States or abroad, © and their interests lead them to all areas of the Smithsonian. They | come here for their individual purposes, as short-term visitors, or as participants in specialized seminars. This year support was pro| vided for 32 short-term visitors, and for one seminar, conducted ~ by Dr. William Fitzhugh of the Smithsonian’s Department of | Anthropology, on the topic of the Maritime and Moorehead }: Archaic cultures of northeastern North America.

Office of American Studies
‘The Office of American Studies conducts a formal graduate program in material culture of the United States which is directed to the original Smithsonian purpose: “the increase and diffusion of | knowledge.” Graduate students from area universities participated a the program, gaining academic credit toward advanced degrees at those universities.
The course in “Material Aspects of American Civilization” was taught by Dr. Washburn (with the assistance of curators and others inside and outside the Smithsonian). A seminar in Museum Visitor Behavior was conducted by Robert A. Lakota and the staff of the Psychological and Sociological Studies Program of the Office of Museum Programs. A seminar in the decorative arts was conducted by Patrick Butler III, Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate. Arthur C. Townsend, Executive Secretary, Maryland Historical Trust and Honorary Smithsonian Research Associate, repeated his seminar in Great Plains history. A Work-Study Program in Historical Archeology, offered by the St. Mary’s City Commission in cooperation with the American Studies Program of the Smithsonian, George Washington University, and St. Mary’s College of Maryland, was held from June 17 to August 23, 1974, with participation by graduate students and Smithsonian staff members. In addition to these formal seminars, supervision of individual reading and research projects, thesis direction, and preparation of comprehensive examinations were undertaken by the director and cooperating Smithsonian staff members.
Staff publications for 1973-1974 are listed in Appendix 8.

Smithsonian Year « 1974
PRESERVATION, STUDY, AND INTERPRETATION are key functions in any museum or museum system. The care with which objects are registered, examined, and treated; the thoroughness with which they are studied and the clarity with which they are presented and interpreted to the public are gauges to a museum’s ultimate excellence. Yet, many of these functions take place away from public view, with the attendant consequence that they are often funded with inadequate resources or carried out in inadequate spaces. This has intermittently occurred at the Smithsonian. The enormous growth of activities which has developed in the last decade, the acquisition of new collections, the founding and construction of new museums as well as new fields of research which have opened could well have justified, in the eyes of some, a slackening of efforts and a shifting of resources to some immediately more glamorous result. It is a measure of the historical commitment of the Institution to the search of excellence that this has not been the case.
The last few years have seen increased emphasis given to developing the infrastructure in the fields of conservation, libraries, archives, and more recently in registration. In these key areas major progress was made in fiscal year 1974.
The Smithsonian Library, which is as old as the Institution itself, has undergone careful in-house examination and assessment of its program and activities, aimed at refining its processes, maximizing its resources and responding more promptly to the needs of the Institution and of the scholarly fraternity. Cooperation with other libraries — federal, state, and private — has led to a pilot program in computerized cataloguing which will vastly improve the rate of processing as well as its quality. The needs of the rare book collections, the ferreting out of uncatalogued rare materials,

<<<Page: 210>>>

and developing procedures for their conservation and restoration
have all made major strides. Greater attention has been paid to
the needs of Bureau libraries and to assisting them in responding more promptly and fully to the requirements of their constituency. Steps were taken which will lead to the complete cataloguing of the important library of the National Air and Space Museum by the dedication of its new building in July 1976.
The Archives of the Institution, concerned primarily with its history and the history of scholarship within it, have been brought to virtually full intellectual control. Inventorying of archival resources has progressed and computer systems have been developed for their cataloguing in close cooperation with curatorial departments and the central and bureau libraries.
Conservation, an ever present, indeed a growing concern to all museums, has been further strengthened by enlarging the amount of space allotted to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, by the purchase of more sensitive and highly specialized equipment, and by the active recruitment of additional staff members. In spite of the progress made, far more needs to be done. The present capacity is hardly able to keep up with immediate, emergency needs, let alone allow for the constant review required by such varied collections as those possessed by the Institution. To maximize resources, avoid the possibilities of duplication, and to focus more clearly on the needs, a Conservation Council was created which regularly will assemble key conservators of all Smithsonian museums. In addition, the staff of the Conservation Analytical Laboratory has been active in assisting training organizations in developing, as rapidly as possible, the additional professionals which are urgently needed not only by the Institution but by museums throughout the country. Conservation is more than the monitoring of conditions and finding palliative methods to remedy the desecrations of time or of man. It is also basic research in the properties of materials and in the manners in which these materials have been assembled by nature or by man. The Conservation Analytical Laboratory has been under increasingly steady pressure to provide technical data to bolster the hypotheses of historical research or stylistic development.
The processing of objects either belonging to the Institution or sent to the Institution for study or exhibition has been thoroughly
196 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 211>>>

’ reorganized. A registration capability is being developed in each
of the Smithsonian museums that did not have it so that each can achieve more expeditious and accurate control on the whereabouts of their holdings and, perhaps more important, monitor their conditions in more efficient ways. A Registrarial Council has been created to develop the required parameters.
The foundations have been laid for the development of a Central Registrar's Office that will help coordinate the growth of the registrarial department in each of the museums, avoid duplications, attain coherence in methods, and help develop basic retrieval systems which, eventually, may be coordinated with regional, national, or, indeed, international data networks. The collections of the Institution represent a data bank unequaled anywhere. The potential of mastering a substantial portion of this wealth by the means of computers has already been demonstrated in discrete areas.
Museums which are essential for the transmittal to the future of the heritage of the past must, however, be of service to the present. There is no contradiction in these terms as long as there is a clear understanding of goals and integrity in their pursuit.
Exhibition is a key function for a museum. In this area, also a major reorganization has brought to each museum intellectual and physical control over the resources with which it can interpret its holdings. Certain museums and bureaus, either too small to have an exhibition resource of their own or that have too infrequent need for such specialized capabilities, are served by the recently developed Office of Exhibits Central. Some of its specialized shops, virtually unmatched for their abilities, particularly in the area of modeling and plastics, serve the entire family of Smithsonian museums. This office also has more general workshops which provide design and construction capabilities to those units that do not have exhibit departments. The reorganization of the Office of Exhibits has led to closer cooperation between design and curatorial staffs.
The Office of Exhibits Central and the exhibit offices in various museums are contributing and participating in the psychological studies conducted by the Office of Museum Programs. These studies are specifically designed to acquire more information about museums as a learning environment and to developing more responsive methods for orientation of the museum visitor. These

<<<Page: 212>>>

studies, which are now coming to fruition, will undoubtedly result | in new exhibit concepts and forms of presentation. Their timeliness — is evident since the Institution is gearing toward an unprecedented efflorescence of exhibition activities which will culminate in the Bicentennial Year.
For the past decade, the Institution has recognized that it had a duty to assist those less wealthy institutions around the country in presenting to their public a richer fare. This concern took on — concrete and permanent form with the development of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service. This has made available hundreds of exhibitions of high quality, at modest cost, to museums, historical societies, colleges, universities, and cultural centers. The efficacy of sites had, in the last few years, been increasingly jeopardized as costs increased and borrowing organizations were unable to assume the rental fees which were necessary for a break-even program. Federal funding of sites, for the — first time in fiscal year 1974, has helped to maintain a balance. Between now and the end of the Bicentennial Year, approximately 250 new exhibitions will be developed on various subjects concerned with history, art, and science. Major emphasis has and will be given to incorporating into traveling exhibitions Smithsonian concepts and, where appropriate, objects so that the Institution’s resources on the Mall can be shared more broadly with the Nation at large. Many of these new exhibitions will be built by the Office of Exhibits Central, to concepts and specifications provided by sITES. To increase the educational usefulness of these exhibitions, kits of educational materials, designed for schools, will be prepared and an increasingly large number of sites exhibitions will be accompanied by didactic materials which will be geared to various levels so that the broadest benefit can be derived by their presence.
Assisting museums in developing the expertise of their staff or in solving special problems has been another historic service of the Institution. In the last few years, it has been rationalized by the Office of Museum Programs through the presentation of workshops, available free of charge to museum personnel from across the country. This program, increased in effectiveness in 1974, will be broadened in the years ahead. Disseminating knowledge on conservation through expertly prepared series of slide lectures is
198 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 213>>>

another service recently developed. This will be supplemented by upward of 40 video-taped programs on the basic principles of conservation and conservation practice. These programs will be available to museums, historical societies, and other interested groups.
The study of the museum as a learning environment, referred to above, has led to staff participation in several seminars, and a series of short articles were published in Museum News. A major monograph by Dr. Chandler Screven, The Measurement and Facilitation of Learning in the Museum Environment: An Experimental Analysis, is under preparation for publication by the Office of Museum Programs.
The National Museum Act, first funded in fiscal year 1972, continued to be administered by the Office of Museum Programs and chaired by the Assistant Secretary. The contribution of the Act to professional enhancement has been universally recognized and has been most visible in the number of workshops, funded under the Act, that have been held around the country under the auspices of the American Association of Museums, the American Association for State and Local History, or other organizations. Developing new training programs and attracting talented new minds to the profession are challenges which museums must meet. The Act has provided a mechanism to assist in these developments and in carrying out special research on museum problems and opportunities.
Renovation and restoration of the Arts and Industries Building, in preparation for the Bicentennial Year, is another major responsibility of the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs. This building, the second structure on the Mall built for the Smithsonian Institution, was opened to the public in 1881. It was erected to house the vast collections which were acquired after the closing of the centennial exhibit of 1876 at Philadelphia.
Appropriately, the first major exhibition to be shown in the renovated Arts and Industries Building will be devoted to the recreation, in capsule form, of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibit. That summary of the Industrial Revolution’s accomplishments and the Western Hemisphere’s no doubt will be the cause of much nostalgia and pride.
The Assistant Secretary has continued to represent the Secretary on the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation and on its

International Centre Committee. He participated actively in a num© ber of professional organizations notably as Vice-President of the ) American Association of Museums, Vice-Chairman of the International Council of Museums Committee of the aam, and Chairman of the aaM Professional Relations’ Committee.
He was elected a member of the Council of the International Centre for the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, Rome, and Vice-President of the International Council of Museums, Paris.
Conservation-Analytical Laboratory
The activities of the Conservation-Analytical Laboratory (cat) support researches in many areas of the Smithsonian — some 30 Divisions in any one year. It would not be proper to reveal some of these in advance of publication by the principal investigator. Others follow.
ca has investigated the use of neutron-activation and electronmicroprobe analysis of various panes of glass in a medieval window for the purpose of detecting replacements, investigating early technology, and with a view to attributing panes to particular workshops.
An analysis has been recently published on the ink of the Vinland Map. Another interpretation of the results appeared possible. The possibility has been investigated, using microchemical, microscopic and X-ray diffraction techniques.
Elemental analyses of majolica ware have revealed the possibility of distinguishing between Spanish and Colonial-Mexican origins for particular specimens.
New X-ray fluorescence equipment for the rapid analysis of objects has been installed and is being brought into service. Some early results in the difficult field of analyzing liquid measures made of pewter have indicated distinct differences in composition for measures of English and Scottish origin.
An iron ball, golf-ball size, that sounded musically when it was struck, was submitted for suggestions about its nature. X-radiography discovered a sounding spiral-wire and loose ball inside.

An important payroll had been written in iron-gall ink on paper so very acid that washing was desirable. Tests of the ink-line revealed that it could be damaged by water, so a safer washing procedure was devised.
A series of elaborate Western saddles in decaying condition, embellished with silver and other threads and metallic plaques, have presented numerous technical problems of identification and treatment in the course of cleaning and repair for exhibition.
Close examination of an eighteenth-century harpsichord-stand preliminary to restoration revealed several phases of earlier rebuilding.
National Museum Act Program
The National Museum Act, authorized in 1966, received an appropriation of $901,000 in fiscal year 1974. In accordance with the legislation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities each received $100,000 from the above sum. Under the legislation, the Smithsonian may grant funds to specific projects that advance the museum profession at large, either through research, training, or publication. Every proposal funded must clearly describe how it will upgrade the museum profession — its techniques, approaches, and methods.
A total of 182 applications were received and reviewed by the Advisory Council who recommended funding for 64 projects. The Advisory Council consists of museum professionals representing different aspects and areas of the museum field — art, science, history, education, conservation, and exhibition. The Council members in 1974 were: William T. Alderson, Director, American Association of State and Local History; Charles E. Buckley, Director,

St. Louis Museum of Art and President, American Association of Museums; W. D. Frankforter, Director, Grand Rapids Public Museum; Lloyd Hezekiah, Director, Brooklyn Children’s Museum; Lawrence J. Majewski, Chairman, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University; Giles W. Mead, Director, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History; T. Miake, Director of Programs, Ontario Science Museum; Arminta Neal, Curator of Graphics Design, Denver Museum of Natural History; Barnes Riznik, Vice President, Old Sturbridge Village; Frank Taylor, Research Associate, Smithsonian Institution; Vernal T. Yadon, Director, Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History; and Paul N. Perrot, Chairman, and Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, Smithsonian Institution.
In 1974, the Advisory Council added a new program — Travel Grants for Beginning Professionals. Persons who have been gainfully employed by the profession for not more than four consecutive years and not less than one year are eligible for grant consideration under this program. The objective of this program is to provide individuals with the opportunity to broaden their knowledge and acquaint themselves with specific operations in other museums and institutions. Twenty-seven grants were awarded in this area.
Special attention was given to Research in Conservation Techniques and Materials. Six projects were funded in this category including, Dating by Thermoluminescence, the Use of Trialkoxyalkylsilanes for the Conservation of Stone, and Control of Shock and Vibration of Objects in Transit.
The National Museum Act continues its strong support for publications to distribute technical information on a broad scale. In addition to support for technical articles as a supplement to Museum News, two books, Museum Trustees Handbook and Rene d’ Harnoncourt: His Art of Installation, and a monograph, Collective Bargaining in Museums were funded.
Seminars, especially those providing in-service training to members of the profession, received special emphasis. Eighteen workshops covering such topics as museum education, fund raising, registration methods, zoo management, administration, publication programs, docent programs, museum architecture, and Bicentennial program planning were a part of the seminar program.

Office of Exhibits Central
The newly established Office of Exhibits Central (oEc) assisted almost every office of the Smithsonian Institution during its first full year of operation. The Special Exhibit Resources Group — | which includes the Models, Plastics, and Restoration Shops and Freeze Dry Laboratory, the Motion Picture Unit, Museum Lighting Office, Audio Visual Unit, and Exhibits Editor’s Office — provided service and consultation in their specializations on a wide variety of projects to each Smithsonian Museum on the Mall. The Central Design and Production Group greatly increased the support of programs for the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, the National Zoological Park, and the Division of Performing Arts’ Festival of American Folklife. Both groups with the administrative staff of the orc developed shop facilities and procedures during this period and continued to refine operations to meet the increasing needs of Smithsonian bureaus and offices.
The Twenty-fourth Street facility was activated for fabrication and graphic production and is now fully operational. The Administrative, Design, and Editor’s offices are located in the Arts and Industries Building and the Special Resources shops and laboratories continue to function in their former locations at the National Museum of Natural History, and the National Museum of History and Technology.
The Office of Exhibits Central recorded 156 project requests in its first year and completed 95 of these. Of the balance, several are long-range or Bicentennial programs of the Institution. Maintaining a philosophy of operational flexibility and improving an ability to perform unique tasks wherever needed, the oc is developing plans and activities with its client organizations within the Institution for both long-range and specialized exhibition services.
Office of Museum Programs The Office of Museum Programs, as part of the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, is an aggregate of programs responsible for coordinating activities related to training
204 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 219>>>

in museology and museography, and the development of new techniques relating to museum administration and practices. Presently, the office maintains three major programs — the Museum Workshop Program, the Conservation Information Program, and the Psychological Studies Program.
The Museum Workshop Program offers workshops, seminars, and training courses to any individual gainfully employed by a museum. Each workshop, taught by Smithsonian staff, is devoted to specific methods or problems. Enrollment is limited, and instructors try to concentrate on the particular needs of each participant. Special attention is usually given to the problems of the small museum’s budget, services, and facilities. Workshops offered this year featured: exhibit design, graphics techniques, silk screening, label writing, editing and production, fabrication and installation methods, model-making, freeze-drying, membership programs, traveling exhibitions, development and financial planning, and psychological methods.
The Conservation Information Program is another service designed to make the knowledge and facilities of the Smithsonian accessible to as large an audience as possible. The program acquaints small museums, interested organizations, and individuals with selected theoretical and practical principles currently practiced in the field of museum conservation. This information — in the form of video-taped programs and slide lectures accompanied by tape commentaries — is lent, free of charge, to all who request it. To date, the Conservation Information Program, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution Conservation-Analytical Laboratory, has produced 4 slide presentations on the curatorial care of objects and 10 more are being prepared during the next year. Some selected subjects include: dry methods in the cleaning of prints, drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of paper; the protective lining of a wooden storage drawer for textiles and costumes; and the wet cleaning of antique cotton, linen and wool.
The Psychological Studies Program provides both direct and evaluative services to the Smithsonian Institution and engages in applied behavior research for broader application to museum professional practices. The staff designs and tests museum behavior studies which aid (1) the study of the museum as an institution for
Museum Programs / 205

<<<Page: 220>>>

the preservation, interpretation, and exhibition of objects, and (2) the construction of several practical and effective visitor-behavior projects employing some of the methods of social science that the museum professional can undertake in his own museum or gallery. The Psychological Studies Program analyzes visitor behavior, especially that of communication. Investigations gauge the educational effectiveness of exhibits and exhibit techniques. The Program is also concerned with the problem of visitor orientation, that is, how to initiate the visitor into the museum experience for optimum use of his time and interests. The primary testing grounds for research activities have been the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of History and Technology, and the Renwick Gallery of the National Collection of Fine Arts. Subjects examined in NMNH were: the relative effectiveness of different exhibit halls; visitor characteristics most likely to determine visitor behavior; and the relationship between the physical layout, familiarity and attractiveness of exhibit halls, and the visitors’ behavior within them. At NMHT, the staff analyzed traffic flow, crowding, attraction and holding power of exhibits, orientation within the gallery, the effectiveness of different kinds of labels, use of facilities, and causes of visitor fatigue. Visitor learning and ways of facilitating it were tested for two years at the Renwick.
Office of the Registrar
The Smithsonian is evaluating and improving its registration system. The Office of the Registrar, which dates back at least to the 1880s once kept records on all specimens and administered all shipping for the Smithsonian. New museums, increases in curatorial staff, and increased accession rates have outpaced the development of the Central Registrar’s office. Presently actions are underway to break with old traditions. During 1973, the Council of Registrars, which represents most museums in the Smithsonian complex, made thorough studies of several registration problems and made extensive reports to the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs. These recommendations are the initial steps toward beneficial change in the Institution’s registration system.
206 / Smithsonian Year 1974

Although yet a vision rather than a reality, the new order of registration at the Smithsonian is discernible, and it is the goal toward which present activities are directed. Each museum will have a registration staff adequate to ensure proper documentation of all acquisitions and to work with curators and conservators to ensure the security and availability of specimens. The Central Registrar will have several functions. As the senior registrar, he will assist museums with their registration problems and he will develop new registration techniques as required by the complexities of the national collections. Most important of all, the Central Registrar will take an Institution-wide view of the national collections and the systems which protect and service these resources.
Thus, the primary achievement of fiscal year 1974 was careful development of goals.
Smithsonian Institution Archives
During fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Archives continued its efforts to gain intellectual control of Archives throughout the Institution. Work continued on records of the National Museum of Natural History, where an intensive survey revealed that some 6.5 million documents remain unprocessed and in need of archival preservation.
The National Museum of History and Technology presents an archival challenge unique among Smithsonian bureaus, because it is the only bureau which maintains a major manuscript collecting program in addition to creating its own administrative records. During 1974 the Archives staff began a major effort to aid in the care and preservation of those materials. A consultant employed by the Archives surveyed the records and manuscript holdings of the Science and Technology Department, and submitted a report to the Director of the National Museum of History and Technology, which will serve as the basis for policy decisions defining the role of the Archives in the National Museum of History and Technology.
The Archives made provisions to care for the records of the National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery, as well as the National Air and Space Museum.

Many other ongoing programs continued, with emphasis on microfilming and efforts to develop computerized finding aids to the Archives’ holdings. Arrangement and microfilming of the accession records continued and the specimen catalogues of several divisions in the National Museum of Natural History were filmed.
Smithsonian Institution Libraries
Nineteen seventy-four was a year of staff participation and a year of experimentation in new forms of operations and services. During the first half of the year the Libraries’ staff took part in a study of the Libraries’ management. A report was submitted to the Director of Libraries in January 1974, and after discussions with the staff, the Director of Libraries accepted more than fifty of the study’s recommendations. The recommendations are being implemented by the Libraries’ administrators. An Implementation Assessment Group, appointed to monitor the progress of implementation, is to make periodic reports to the Director of Libraries and to the staff. This management study introduced an atmosphere of staff participation in decision making.
The most promising technical development was the Libraries’ experiment with the Ohio College Library Center (octc) on-line cataloguing system. This system produces catalogue cards formatted to Smithsonian specifications faster and more efficiently than the previously used manual procedures. Furthermore, the octc system, which provides on-line access to a large and growing bibliographic data base, has facilitated the process of ordering library materials. The introduction of this system has effected some experiments in workflow and staffing patterns to permit more efficient use of personnel. The staff is now assessing the effectiveness of the octc system and is planning for expansion of automated systems.
Throughout the year, bureau and branch librarians met to discuss common problems. For the first time, librarians responsible for the development and maintenance of library collections in various bureaus and departments participated in the allocation of book and binding funds for the Libraries. The Deputy Assistant Director for
208 / Smithsonian Year 1974

Bureau Services has initiated cooperative efforts to formulate a library collection development policy for the Institution.
Services to users have been augmented. For example, the National Air and Space Museum Library produces a current awareness list; users in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Radiation Biology Laboratory Libraries are provided with individually profiled current awareness services; librarians at the National Zoological Park and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute index relevant literature for their users.
Librarians serving bureaus and departments of the Institution have been attempting to become more closely involved with programs and plans of the bureaus which they serve. The National Air and Space Museum librarian serves as Chairperson of the NASM Collection Development Committee; both the National Air and Space Museum and National Collection of Fine Arts/National Portrait Gallery librarians attend staff meetings held by their bureau directors; at the request of the National Museum of History and Technology librarian, a library committee of curators has been formed to advise the bureau librarian.
In spite of a limited budget for the purchase of books and journals, the Libraries continued to acquire many of the materials required to support Smithsonian Institution programs. To a large extent, important gifts and the Libraries’ well-established exchange program made this possible. The year saw exchange programs initiated with the People’s Republic of China and with the Museums and Monuments Office in Ghana.
The binding and preservation program of the Libraries has been hampered for a number of years by lack of adequate funds. In anticipation of increased support, binding and preservation needs have been assessed. The program to identify and preserve rare books in the Institution continued.
One area of concern expressed in the Libraries’ management study was the personnel program. As a result, some changes in personnel policies and staffing are being tested and a Staff Development Committee has been appointed.
The Libraries supported staff participation in continuing education and professional activities such as seminars, conferences, meetings, and training courses. Twenty-six Libraries’ staff members

attended training courses funded by the Libraries. Several staff members have received outstanding professional recognition. Catherine Scott, NasM bureau librarian, is a member of the Board of Visitors of Catholic University of America Library and a member of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. William Walker, ncra/npc librarian, is Vice Chairman Elect of the Art Libraries Society of North America (artis/NA). Elaine Sloan, Assistant to the Director for Planning and Research, received a Ph.D. in Library and Information Services from the University of Maryland. Dr. Russell Shank, Director of Libraries, completed his term as President of the Association of College and Research Libraries and was elected Vice President, President Elect of the United States Book Exchange. Dr. Shank was the recipient of a fellowship from the Council of Library Resources and was granted sabbatical leave by the Smithsonian from February to September, 1974, to study the implications of telecommunications policy for libraries and information resources. Jean Chandler Smith, Assistant Director for Bureau Services, was appointed Acting Director of Libraries.
Among the many distinguished visitors to the Smithsonian Institution Libraries was a delegation of heads of libraries from the People’s Republic of China. The Libraries provided graduate . library school students opportunities for study and field work. As | part of a training program, two American Indians from Navajo Community College Library worked in the Anthropology, NMHT, and nas Libraries.

Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service
The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (sites) circulates more shows on more subjects to more people than anyone else. It is unique in that it circulates exhibitions of history, science, and technology in addition to exhibitions on art.
This past year, several new initiatives were undertaken as a response to the needs of sites’ customers. Each new effort had to be oriented philosophically and financially to the Smithsonian’s effort to increase as well as diffuse knowledge.
This year, siTEs received its first direct federal appropriation. Fulfilling a promise to Congress, appropriated funds were directed toward keeping rental fees within the range of medium and small institutions that count on the Smithsonian for high quality exhibitions. Further, federal funds were used to improve exhibition quality by expanding programming and educational activities suggestions to more effectively use the circulating shows.
The primary responsibility for the development of these materials is being pursued by a Program Coordinator, a new position on the Traveling Exhibition Service staff. It has been determined that there are far too many projects for one such position and plans have been made to add more persons in the future.
SITES representatives were present at each of the six regional meetings of the American Association of Museums this year. Inquiries about sITES’ program and consultation to others on the travel of shows were provided. A significant amount of foreign as well as domestic travel was undertaken to assure that sITEs standards were upheld in the preparation of shows for travel. In addition to many of the 50 states and Puerto Rico, sires staff worked with exhibition sources in Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Great Britain, Norway, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. Four members of the siTEs staff attended the American Association of Museums national meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, and a delegate was sent to the International Council of Museums meeting in Copenhagen.
A Bicentennial Exhibitions effort was launched this year with the assignment of two full-time -staff members to this program. Two exhibitions especially mounted for the Bicentennial began their tours.
A major program to improve sits’ exhibition offerings in science
214 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 229>>>

was begun. A National Science Foundation grant to develop a series of exhibitions with the topic of “Understanding the Environment” provided the major impetus for the program.
A week-long workshop on the travel of exhibitions was held at sires headquarters in April 1974. Nine representatives from museums in the United States, one from Puerto Rico, and two from Canada participated.
sites concluded the year having booked over 600 exhibitions viewed by an estimated 4,800,000 persons. There are now 2,600 institutions on SITES mailing lists. At the end of the year, 109 exhibitions were in circulation. During the twelve-month period, 28 exhibitions were produced for tour and 3 were refurbished for extended
In fiscal year 1974, approximately $250,000 in grants, gifts, and contracts were received to develop exhibitions and educational programs. With the federal appropriation, these funds had the effect of making sites exhibitions more accessible than ever before.

Smithsonian Year 1974
DurING THE PAsT 12 months an exciting fermentation has begun in the area of Public Service. This activity is in response to the impact of a larger public interest in a more extensive Smithsonian Institution, and, in equal measure, to a notably more discerning public interest in the educational potential of the Smithsonian museums and galleries, and their programs. In building the resources and the organization to meet these challenges, the Public Service divisions are helping to bring into balance the Institution’s fulfillment of Mr. Smithson’s mandate for the diffusion of knowledge as well as its increase.
For, basically, the role of Public Service is education, and Smithsonian educational activity has been mushrooming as the desire of the American public of all ages to be educated has burgeoned in one of the liveliest social phenomena of our time. During the year, 21 Smithsonian bureaus conducted specifically educational programs which reached a total of close to 300,000 people. These were by no means all Public Service functions, but all complemented the direct educational role of the Office of Public Service. Our view, in fact, is that our major museum and gallery directors are the best qualified to develop education programs related to their collections or researches. In consequence, we decentralized the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and thereby made people and money available for the establishment of education specialist positions and supporting sections in all of the principal museums and galleries. A comparable reorganization is being considered for the Office of Public Affairs; in addition, the funds formerly allotted to the Smithsonian Institution Press and divided by the Director of the Press among interested bureaus will henceforth be distributed directly to

<<<Page: 232>>>

bureau chiefs so that each may determine his own publishing priorities. Such changes permit us to reorganize the central offices of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and ultimately of the Office of Public Affairs so that their efforts can be focused on Institution-wide requirements.
The twin challenges posed by Smithsonian growth and by the approach of the Bicentennial have stimulated every one of the Public Service divisions, as will be evident in the following accounts. At the end of fiscal 1974 Smithsonian (magazine) circulation and National Associate membership exceeded 600,000 and was steadily climbing; Resident Associate membership topped 20,000; Division of Performing Arts-produced Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz had sold 30,000 copies; and a striking further demonstration of public enthusiasm for Office of Public Service programs was evident in the long queues which formed before each of the 7 daily showings of the Ascent of Man film series, arranged by the Office of Public Service Free Film Theatre. In addition, not only the Public Service bureaus but the entire Institution is preparing for the anticipated results of the Smithsonian television series which will begin in the fall of 1974 and will bring Smithsonian treasures and Smithsonian interests to 20 to 40 million television viewers across the Nation. Every increase in public interest in the Smithsonian generates a requirement for service to that public, whether it be the development of new educational facilities or simply the organization and staffing of an office to reply to the increase in letters of inquiry or suggestion addressed to the Smithsonian.
Fiscal year 1974 did bring one reduction in the organizational makeup of the Office of Public Service with the very appropriate transfer of the Office of International Activities to the Office of the Secretary for Science.
Finally, the Office of Public Services wishes to express its warm appreciation to the 1120 dedicated members of the Smithsonian volunteers and the 530 Smithsonian volunteer docents who gave so much of their time and service to the Institution during 1974, and without whose help “Smithsonian Public Service” would have a far more limited connotation.

Anacostia Neighborhood Museum
The Anacostia Neighborhood Museum now in its sixth year has continued to enrich the experience of museum visitors with a variety of exhibits and educational programs.
The year was highlighted by a series of major exhibitions. ‘““The Evolution of a Community, Part II’ communicated areas of concern that were relevant to all urban communities. It represented the shared feelings of the people of Anacostia concerning housing, unemployment, education, drug abuse, and crime. “Africa: Three Out of Many” represented the African language of art in its threedimensional forms of sculpture and masks. The art, the religious inspirations, history, and culture depicted the people of Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria— the three countries selected from many African nations.
The Barnett-Aden collection of paintings, sculptures, and prints was shown. The collection reflected the talents and concerns of an exciting group of American and Afro-American artists who emerged from the period which historians call the ‘““Harlem Renaissance.”

Exhibits at the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, “Africa: Three Out of Many — Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria” (opposite page) and “The Barnett-Aden Collection” held January 20 to May 6, 1974, attracted many visitors. The latter proved to be an important art event in the Metropolitan area.
A variety of educational programs and films of popular interest were given during each exhibit and throughout the year. Over 40,000 children and teenagers participated in these activities.
The Mobile Division continues to take the museum to the people. Portable exhibits, teaching aids, demonstrations, and a Speakers’ Bureau are all included in its outreach program.
The history of the Anacostia community is presently being researched for a publication entitled Anacostia Story, which is being prepared for the Bicentennial. Anacostia Neighborhood Museum is also looking forward to completion in 1974 of the construction of an Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory where, in addition to the preparation and production of exhibits for the Museum, an exhibits training program will train minority members in the arts and crafts of museum design and production. This laboratory, when in operation, will provide improved facilities for experimentation in exhibit design and production, which has been a goal of the Museum since its inception.

Division of Performing Arts
Expanding the Institution’s role as conservator and preserver of the’ Nation’s creative forces, the Division of Performing Arts presented | the Seventh consecutive Festival of American Folklife, which has become the largest summertime event in the Nation’s Capital, and six different series and numerous individual events during the winter programs.
During the 1973-1974 season, 15,000 people attended concerts offering a range of creative musical expressions from baroque to bluegrass, as well as the second season of Jazz Heritage Concerts. Such artists as Leon Fleisher and the Theater Chamber Players, Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, Earl Brown, Earl Hines, and Carmen McRae were presented. Most concerts were preceded by free public workshops. To cope with capacity audiences, workshops had to be moved from the Hall of Musical Instruments to the Baird Auditorium midway through the season.
A new recording program instituted by the Division issued a historic first, the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz, a boxed, six-record set including 85 selections from 17 record companies. The set was produced by Martin Williams, Director of the Jazz Program. Receiving critical acclaim and an unprecedented number of orders, the Collection is now in its third printing.
The Smithsonian Resident Puppet Theater, one of two continuously operated puppet theaters in the country, attracted 3000 visitors each week to three different shows: Patchwork, an improvisational series with music, Pinocchio, a new version of the classic, and What If? ..., a puppet science-fiction fantasy. The Performing Arts Division contributes to a “lively mall” area through the operation of the carousel and the original old-time popcorn machine.
Performing Arts shares the American experience in its many creative forms with museum visitors and people across the Nation through the Smithsonian Touring Performance Service, offering performances not available through commercial management to museums, colleges, universities, and cultural centers. The 19731974 season saw 51 performances sent to 23 states, by the Smithsonian Puppet Theater, The American Folklife Company, High-

‘woods String Band, Horace Silver, Jean Ritchie, and others. A postFestival tour of Serbo-Croatian musicians traveling to ethnic communities in 6 cities became a pilot project which will service increased requests from state and local communities for Smithsonian aid in booking Bicentennial programs.
The Seventh Festival of American Folklife featured a new site, an expanded schedule, and new themes leading to a season-long Bicentennial Festival in 1976. The 1973 presentation focused on four theme areas that would be expanded for the Bicentennial: Old Ways in the New World, Working Americans, Native Americans, and Regional America. The Smithsonian was joined by the National Park Service as a co-sponsor. Called the “great national family reunion,” the Festival attracted 1.3 million visitors, who came to learn more about themselves and about others from the United States and around the world.
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education
Fiscal year 1974 has brought new directions and new challenges to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. As recently redefined, the Office is now a service unit, charged with giving assistance, upon request, to the Bureau education offices of all of the Smithsonian museums, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, and the National Zoo.
A primary responsibility of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (oEsE) is to encourage cooperation and exchange of information among the Smithsonian education offices and between those offices and the District of Columbia area schools. Toward this end, a number of efforts are underway. Two publications — a monthly newsletter, Let’s Go, and an annual brochure, Learning Opportunities for Schools — inform teachers of Smithsonian programs and other activities of particular interest to young people and contain suggestions for using museums as educational resources. The publications are sent free of charge to over 1300 area schools. In addition, an annual Museum Education Day is held for teachers, school administrators, and museum educators. This year’s event, which took place at the National Portrait Gallery and the National Collection of Fine Arts, presented a
Public Service / 225

<<<Page: 240>>>

selection of art, history, and science programs offered to school
groups by the various education offices. A folk-music workshop, a
Japanese tea ceremony, and a reenactment of the trial of abolitionist John Brown were among the programs demonstrated. A highlight of the day was a live animal demonstration by special
guests from the Boston Museum of Science. Portions of Museum —
Education Day were filmed by wrop-tv and shown on “Eyewitness News.”
Teachers are reached also by a summer workshop program, now in its third year, which drew 34 participants from Montgomery County and the District of Columbia in 1973. The workshops enable teachers to develop curriculum units to be used in conjunction with museum visits. One manifestation of the workshops is presently in evidence in a Montgomery County fourth-grade classroom, where students have created an exhibit of American Indian crafts and are learning traditional methods of pottery-making and weaving in connection with visits to the National Museum of Natural History. Altogether, an estimated 1500 students have been engaged in art, history, and science projects during the 1973-1974 school year as a result of the summer workshops.
In 1973-1974, the energy crisis brought a disappointing 26 percent decrease in the number of school tours scheduled by this office for the Mall museums. The decline was represented by 2187 tours given to 50,865 children. Nonetheless, classes came from as far away as Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and Athens, Georgia, for the National Museum of Natural History’s Early Man tour; and the number of outreach programs given in area classrooms jumped an encouraging 18 percent, serving a total of 9,438 children through 357 presentations.
An expanding force of volunteer docents, now numbering 326, has been recruited and trained by orst. To augment their regular training, the docents were able to attend two seminar lecture series in 1973 — one in American studies and the other in the natural sciences. Good indicators of the success of the docents in inspiring young visitors to think about the exhibits and draw conclusions from what they see are the comments the students make in the course of their guided tours. The following are a few of the comments recently overheard on a Colonial Life tour in the Museum of History and Technology: |

Fourth-grade boy: “Suppose you couldn’t learn how to do all those things that needed to be done. What would have happened to you?”
Third-grade girl: ‘““There’s one reason I’d sooner have lived back in those days than now, and that’s because back in those days you could be proud of what you did.”
Fourth-grade girl: ‘““When so much is up to you, I guess you sort of want to work hard at it because it makes you feel good to do it well.”
For the past 4 years, a learning/service experience for teenager volunteers has been provided through ogse’s summer “Info” program. In June, July, and August of 1973, more than 100 high school students, selected and trained by oese, conducted visitors through the Mall museums.
Several new programs are now in the planning stages. An audiovisual presentation orienting teachers to Smithsonian education service is being considered, as are continuing teacher workshops beginning with the 1974-1975 school year. Through workshops, publications, and related activities the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will continue to serve the Smithsonian’s education offices and Washington area schools.
Office of Public Affairs
In this technological age Americans receive more and more of their information and education from various forms of the electronic media. This fact alone poses new challenges to the museum community as well as to a diverse academic institution such as the Smithsonian, which has a charter to disseminate, as well as to increase, knowledge among mankind.
Audio and film recordings are the staples of the electronic media, but they require time, energy, imagination, skill, and heavy budgetary commitments to produce in a professional and meaningful manner. Yet, in the years to come, they will be as significant and lasting, perhaps, in the Smithsonian’s archives as many editions of the printed word.

An upcoming series of major prime-time television specials, based upon the activities of the Smithsonian Institution, thrust a_ significant new role on the Office of Public Affairs in fiscal 1974. The Office became the coordinator of an allied effort of scientists, administrators, historians, and other Smithsonian professionals and the writers, producers, and other creative talents of the David L. Wolper organization. The goal of this joint effort is to bring home the richness and variety of the Institution’s knowledge to millions of Americans who might not otherwise have had an opportunity to become aware of the Smithsonian’s interests.
In addition to preparations for this 1974-1975 Smithsonian series, to be broadcast on the css television network as a presentation of the DuPont Cavalcade of television, the growth of the Smithsonian during the year placed other new demands on the Office of Public Affairs to provide a wide range of public information activities. The Office was heavily involved in preparations for the expanded Festival of American Folklife on the Mall, the new product development program, the planned opening of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in the fall of 1974, and the Bicentennial, as well as in providing services to the ongoing Smithsonian programs of research, collections, and exhibits.
A telecommunications coordinator was selected from more than 300 applicants to oversee preparations for the Smithsonian’s new television series and the Institution’s other public efforts in the audiovisual media. The telecommunications staff of the Office of Public Affairs cooperated with numerous television, film, and radio producers planning programs based on Smithsonian activities, in addition to working with a producer who expects to air three significant television specials on the Smithsonian during the 1974— 1975 season. Several documentary films on various aspects of the Smithsonian were also developed. ‘Radio Smithsonian” continued to produce a weekly half-hour radio program which during the past year was carried by some 95 radio stations Nationwide.
During the past year the News Bureau of the Office of Public Affairs wrote and distributed 311 news releases and responded to hundreds of requests from the wire services, newspapers, magazines, and the public for information on Smithsonian activities. A sampler of press clippings reflecting representative press interest

in the Smithsonian was initiated. Some 2.5 million building guides and brochures were also produced by the Office.
The Office continued to produce the Smithsonian Torch, a newspaper for the Institution’s employees, the widely circulated monthly Smithsonian Calendar of Events, and the quarterly Smithsonian Research Reports which has been requested by the scientific communities of a number of other nations. The publication, Increase and _ Diffusion, was revised and brought up to date. | Current information on daily events and exhibits was provided by the recorded telephone service Dial-a~-Museum. From information furnished by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Dial-a-Phenomenon service provided information enabling callers to locate and observe artificial satellites as well as to identify celestial bodies.
The Special Events staff assisted in the planning, preparation, and coordination of approximately 600 events during fiscal 1974, including lectures, conferences, symposia, openings of exhibitions, press previews, concerts, luncheons, dinners, and receptions.
The staff participated in arrangements for tours for the new wife of the Secretary of State; the wives of visiting Latin American foreign ministers; the Empress of Iran and her three children; Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan; and, during the Festival of American Folklife, the Secretary of Labor, President of the art-cio, and the mainland China mission to Washington.
Other events in which the staff participated were Mrs. Nixon’s installation of the Department of the Interior’s historic site plaque at the National Collection of Fine Arts National Portrait Gallery | building’s courtyard, Speaker Carl Albert’s presentation of a portrait of himself, and Mrs. Johnson’s presentation of a bust of President | Johnson.
The Special Events staff was also responsible for arrangements when a group of Congressional wives honored Mrs. Gerald Ford in the Commons, with an evening of entertainment by the British Players. The Secretaries of Commerce and Treasury and the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency hosted parties and tours for several Soviet Union delegations; and the Secretary held the biennial Diplomatic Dinner at the Renwick Gallery for the heads of 18 foreign missions and a Fourth of July party for other diplomats on the terrace of the Museum of History and Technology to _ watch the Monument fireworks.

Office of Smithsonian Symposia and Seminars
Improving public understanding of the work of academic specialists continued to serve as the goal of educational experiments of the Office of Seminars in 1974. Its privately supported programs reflect the spirit of the classic series Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, initiated by Secretary Joseph Henry in 1847. (“Knowledge should not be viewed as existing in isolated parts but as a whole, each portion of which throws light on all the other. ..”) Mainly, the office prepares for publication — and otherwise helps disseminate, through seminars, symposia, television, and radio — the fruits of scholarly investigations and insights about the ideas, customs, skills, and art of various cultures and civilizations. It calls upon the Smithsonian’s own talents and combines these with resources of other museums, the government, corporations, foundations, universities, research institutions, and professional societies.
The Cultural Drama, for example, was published in 1974. An illustrated collection of essays on modern identities and social ferment, the volume features an introduction by Secretary S. Dillon Ripley and a prologue calling for use of the American Bicentennial observance to celebrate cultural diversity and find a new national metaphor to replace “‘the melting pot.’ The Charles F. Kettering Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund provided support for the 1970 symposium out of which the book developed.
Also linked to the Bicentennial are plans started in 1974 for a symposium, “Kin and Communities: The Peopling of America,” scheduled for May 1976 as a scholarly prelude to the Smithsonian Institution National Park Service Festival of American Folklife. The symposium is being organized in liaison with other units of the Smithsonian and in cooperation with the Department of History, American University, among other external organizations. Consultants include Dr. Robert Coles, psychiatrist, Harvard Uni-
versity; Eli Evans, author of The Provincials; Dr. Albert Gollin, —
Bureau of Social Science Research, Inc.; Dr. David Goslin, sociologist, National Academy of Sciences; Dr. Margaret Mead, American Museum of Natural History ;and Allon Schoener, author of Portal to America: The Lower East Side, 1870-1925.

Secretary Ripley’s suggestion that the Smithsonian sponsor a Museum of the Family of Man to complete a chain of museums or exhibition centers on the Mall prompted a cooperative educational project involving the Smithsonian and the College of Architecture, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia. Seminars and interviews were organized for faculty
and students to improve their knowledge of the workings of mu|
seums as preparation for their conceptualizing and designing a museum of mankind as a classroom exercise. Students’ reports, sketches, construction models, videotapes, and other materials will be given to the Smithsonian.
“Voluntarism and the Public Interest in American Society,” an invitational seminar series, continued into 1974 with future programs being planned in cooperation with the National Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs headed by John Filer, chairman, Aetna Life and Casualty Company. Sponsored jointly with the Office of Development, the series spanned two years of twelve programs involving foundation officers, tax lawyers,
government officials, scholars, and leaders of voluntary associa©
tions. The Non-Profit Report, Museum News, and Foundation News have published reports of the series. David L. Sills, editor of the
International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, serves as editorial )
consultant in planning an eventual volume of the papers and dis-
cussions. Speakers in 1974 included Margaret Mead leading a .
discussion on “New Initiatives in Environmental Renewal,” Barry Commoner speaking on ‘The Scientist’s Responsibility Toward a Society in Crisis,” and participants in an all-day workshop on “What Can Be Done About the African Drought?”
“Innovation in Technology” is the theme of a two-part video taped seminar produced in 1974 by the Office of Seminars in cooperation with the National Academy of Engineering and the Exxon Corporation. Intended to stimulate classroom discussions in schools of management and engineering, as well as those in the humanities, the taped program included materials from engineers’ presentations during the Copernicus symposium and subsequent commentaries by such interpreters of technology as Stephen Schwartz, Claire Nader, Don Walsh, Frank Piasecki, Robert Multhauf, and T. Dixon Long.

The office also continued to work closely with seminar and symposium planning of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the National Air and Space Museum.
The celebration of the quincentennial of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus continued with the Office of Seminars assisting Professor Owen Gingerich in his editing of the forthcoming Smithsonian Press book The Nature of Scientific Discovery, based on the 1973 symposium; laying the groundwork in Warsaw for an eventual Polish-language edition to be published in cooperation with the Polish Academy of Sciences; cosponsoring with the Smithsonian’s Division of Performing Arts a presentation at the Institution of Jerzy Grotowski, Poland’s avant-garde actor-director; and distributing to science attachés in American embassies copies of the prize-winning Leonard Baskin Copernicus poster designed by Stephen Kraft. The London periodical Encounter and The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists have published essays contributed to the Gingerich volume by Werner Heisenberg and Gerald Holton. The Folger Shakespeare Library, in planning its 1974 Petrarch celebration, drew upon the Smithsonian’s experience with Copernicus, and the office continued to work closely with the Copernicus Society of America in responding to numerous inquiries of scholarly and ethnic communities seeking information on Copernicus and Renaissance culture. Moreover, the office helped to facilitate new showings of Jacob Bronowski’s spc-Time-Life documentary film series The Ascent of Man, originally premiered in Washington during the Smithsonian-National Academy of Sciences observance of Copernicus Week.
Reading Is Fundamental, Inc.
A new year and a new president began concurrently as Dr. Sidney Nelson assumed the presidency of Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., in August 1973.
By May 1, 1974, the number of active Reading Is Fundamental (RIF) programs (162) and developing programs (68) totaled 230. At the same time in 1973, this total was 139, of which 111 were active programs. These programs are all voluntary regional efforts

which call on rir Headquarters for program guidance, but depend on their own resources for staffing funds. As a result of endorsement by their national organizations, American Association of University Women (AAuw) chapters now sponsor 24 local programs, and the Jaycees, 8. Without such a national imprimatur, local Junior Leagues sponsor 9 RIF programs — a marked increase over last year. Junior Women’s Clubs sponsor 11 local rir programs.
During fiscal 1974, a growing number of interracial and black service organizations took local rir programs as their principal cause. These include the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority; Jack & Jill, Inc.; Negro Business and Professional Women; National Council of ' Negro Women; t1nxs; the Urban League and Urban League Guilds.
Endorsement from the Office of Education has led to the support of 50 local programs — 25 under Title I and 25 Right-to-Read programs. The largest single program supported by federal funds’ (Emergency School Assistance Act) was the Brooklyn, New York, program involving 50,000 children in 100 schools in kindergarten through the third grade. Over 10,000 requests for RIF’s services| were received from throughout the United States as a result of an. article which appeared in the February 1974 Reader’s Digest, entitled “A Reading Program That Works.”
Major activities of r1F’s central office involved the preparation of a r1F handbook on starting and conducting a local RIF program in the field, a national workshop which brought together 56 project. directors and staff from 15 states to share experiences and ideas, a broad gauge assessment of the number and character of local RIF programs, public education through a national public service advertising campaign, and the publication and distribution of a newsletter.
The major source of rIF’s current support, a three year grant of $1,150,000 from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, will termi| nate in 1975. With this in view, the Board of Directors under the able leadership of Mrs. Robert S. McNamara, initiated a four-year campaign to solicit funds from foundations, corporations, and | interested individuals.
The Carnegie Corporation of New York agreed to fund a national evaluation of the impact of the Reading Is Fundamental program. The sum of $106,655 was appropriated to the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York for this purpose.

A new expanded rir program for the Capital was launched under the leadership of Mrs. Elliott L. Richardson and Mrs. Joseph J. Sisco. Funds for the program which will serve 30,000 children during the next three years have been provided by the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation, the National Home Library Foundation, and the Hattie M. Strong Foundation.
Smithsonian Magazine
It has been the aim of the magazine, Smithsonian, over the past 4 fiscal years to provide a publication — as a benefit for National and Resident members of Smithsonian Associates — which would be attractive to readers with a high educational level and to advertisers who deal in quality products. Everything seemed to come together in fiscal 1974.
When the magazine reached 600,000 net paid circulation, it ‘found itself in an eminent position among the traditional “class” magazines, double the circulation of American Heritage, Natural History, Harper's, and Atlantic Monthly, and larger than Scientific American and the New Yorker.
During the year, the magazine was recognized as an important national publication by two major newsweeklies, Time and Newsweek, which took note of the magazine’s success and heralded it for its editorial excellence. Most critics, in print and by word of mouth, praised the magazine for its variety, its writing, and the beauty of its illustrations.
Smithsonian’s circulation increased 33 percent and its advertising revenue 85 percent in fiscal 1974 despite a softening of the economy. The magazine has carried a rich and varied selection of advertisements from major companies in the United States, as well as numerous travel and consumer goods offerings. A random sampling from one issue, for example, shows, among others, advertisements from Kodak, General Electric, General Motors, Bergstrom Paper, Hueblein, General Telephone and Electronics, Alcoa, National Distillers, Atlantic Richfield, Smith-Corona, Western Electric, Guerlain, Bethlehem Steel, Exxon, DeBeers, and Franklin Mint.

<<<Page: 254>>>

The editorial content itself dealt with the subjects of previous years: stronger and stronger articles on conservation and energy; treatments of museum spectaculars around the world in-depth — for example, the tapestry treasures at the Metropolitan and the beauty of Chinese art at the Musée du Petit Palais; stimulating articles on natural and hard sciences such as the mystery of the “black holes” in space, articles on Smithsonian gems and model planes, Japanese traditions, and the ivory-billed woodpecker. ...
The magazine also continued to give candid and intimate views of history, especially American history. The series ““America Two
Hundred Years Ago,” a month-by-month narrative of the events ©
preceding the American Revolution, became a nationwide favorite.
In Smithsonian Year 1969 it was predicted that the magazine would pay its way in the third year of publication. The prophecy was correct — so accurate that in 1974 the magazine will make a significant contribution to the general operating funds of the private sector of the Institution.
At any given time it is, of course, impractical to predict future degrees of inflation and possible recessions, which will have to be faced. Certainly, production costs have been going up. However, one can predict confidently that, both with regard to the Institution
and to the areas in which the Institution is interested, the editorial .
challenges will be met and the quality will continue to improve. And it is the policy of Smithsonian’s management, both editorially and in the business areas, to remain flexible and resourceful.
Smithsonian Associates
The Smithsonian Associates experienced an extraordinary growth this year in membership numbers and in program activities. National membership increased from 450,000 to 600,000. Resident
membership grew from 15,000 at the end of fiscal year 1973 to |
22,000 at the end of fiscal year 1974, representing 44,000 individuals in the Washington metropolitan area.
Heightened interest in Associate membership can be attributed to a number of factors, not the least of which is greater program visibility through the Smithsonian (magazine), the monthly As-

sociate newsletter, the Smithsonian Calendar of Events, and continuous media coverage.
The publication of an all-purpose brochure describing the National and the Resident Associate programs has proved to be a useful tool to clarify the opportunities of each type of membership. _ Cultural and educational programs of the Resident program ‘include four semesters of classes a year, family events, symposia on provocative subjects, films, lectures, field trips, behind-the-scenes tours, and activities for young people. This year emphasis has switched from a few lecture classes in the arts, sciences, and humanities, with a multitude of crafts classes, to a balanced class program of over 65 classes per semester, with an average of 22 lecture classes for adults taught by Smithsonian and visiting scholars, studio classes, and children’s classes. Average enrollment for these classes was 2300 per semester.
Children’s activities and classes have expanded and participation has been stressed. The scholarship program that enables inner-city children to attend Young Associate classes reached a new high of 307 enrollees. This project was begun and funded by the Women’s Committee of the Associates. Implementation of a “Family Events” page in the monthly newsletter expresses concern for and interest in family activities.
The number of day tours and overnight tours quadrupled. Special events increased from 45 to 86. Free events rose from 30 to 43 with attendance of 23,500.
Cooperation with divisions and bureaus within the Institution, jand other cultural, educational, and civic organizations increased. For the first time the Resident Associate program conducted a Membership Workshop, attended by representatives of 23 museums from all over the country. Two programs received support from the National Endowment for the Arts. The scope of the film series and festivals increased. Four major film series and two festivals of prize-winning noncommercial films were held. Poetry readings by distinguished poets were added to the long list of program activities and many distinguished guests from outside the family of Smithsonian scholars and performers who gave lectures or led discussions.
The Resident program contributed over $27,000 to the unrestricted private funds of the Institution without increasing dues or the prices of events. Especially popular this year were the Giants

of Contemporary Architecture class in which architects and architectural historians discussed outstanding masterpieces; Yehudi Menuhin’s lecture on “Creativity” where Associates sat spellbound; Judith Crist’s films of the seventies; Don a Hardhat, a tour of the Washington Metro subway system now under construction; and Shroeder loves Beethoven, a special Christmas party for Young Associates.
More than 750 Associates participated in 20 Domestic and Foreign Study Tours to such places as Georgia to study the culture of Indian moundbuilders; to Big Cypress Swamp in the Florida Everglades to study flora and fauna; and to Ethiopia and Kenya to study ancient and contemporary cultures. One particularly successful and exciting trip was a cruise to the lagoons and coast of Baja California in search of whales, sea elephants, and sea lions.
The Contributing membership, for individuals who donate $50 or more annually, grew from 200 to 380 contributors. Added benefits for contributing members included a selection of exhibition catalogues and a reception to meet Brooke Hindle, new director of the National Museum of History and Technology.
At Christmas, the Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates sponsored their third successful Christmas Dance. The dance was staged around the African bush elephant in the National Museum of Natural History. Proceeds were given to the Insect Zoo, an exhibition of live insects, which the Committee has supported for 3 years, and to the scholarship fund of the Resident program. A larger portion of this year’s proceeds will establish an experimental exhibit for handicapped visitors to the National Museum of Natural History.
The National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, a group composed of 26 industrial and citizen leaders, met in October 1973 and adopted a set of bylaws. The Board was largely responsible for stimulating corporate support to the Institution in excess of: $100,000 for fiscal year 1974. .
One of the greatest services to the Institution is performed by the Associates Reception Center. Serving as the central visitor! information office for Associates and for the public, the Center has: greatly strengthened its ability to respond to increasing demands, for informational assistance. Over 13,000 pieces of mail requesting

everything from general information for visiting purposes to specific technical data were answered; 125,000 phone inquiries representing a 100-percent increase in traffic over the previous 12-month period were also channeled through the Center. Over 5000 Associate families from across the country registered in the Center’s guest book — a figure which reflects only one-third of all the Associates actually seeking the Center’s assistance.
Ninety additional information volunteers were recruited, trained, and scheduled by the Center, enabling double coverage at several information desks and the assumption of the additional responsibility of maintaining an information desk at the Renwick Gallery. The significance of voluntarism as an important Smithsonian resource was more widely recognized this year through an Institutionwide survey conducted by the Center. The survey found that 1120 volunteers contributed 105,000 hours of service, an equivalent of 77 man-years of labor worth $914,000.
For the National membership, a comprehensive Guide to the Nation’s Capital and the Smithsonian Institution was produced in cooperation with Smithsonian and appeared in the April issue as the magazine’s first supplement.
Smithsonian Institution Press
As the official publications arm of the Smithsonian, the Smithsonian Institution Press is responsible for the editing, design, production, and distribution of more than ome hundred scholarly monographs, scientific reports, definitive art catalogues, and informational brochures each year. Although, in most cases, the Press staff does not do the actual writing, it does professionally assist its authors in all the necessary steps in editorial and design consultation while the manuscript is in preparation, in review of the final draft (including all illustrative material), in substantive editing, copy preparation for the printer, design, layout, paste-up, production supervision, and in delivery of the finished product to the author and to thousands of libraries, scholars, and members of an interested audience here in Washington and throughout the world. The Press staff has taken satisfaction from its behind-the-scenes share in the laudatory reviews which have appeared in respected

<<<Page: 262>>>

journals, together with praise from the academic community, for Smithsonian publications issued during the year — notable among. which were Continental Drift, by Ursula Marvin of the Smithsonian) Astrophysical Observatory, and The Papers of Joseph Henry, edited by Nathan Reingold.
There are times, too, when honors redound more directly to the work of the Press staff. This has been such a year. At the eleventh, annual blue pencil awards presentation of the Federal Editors Association the Smithsonian Institution Press won 6 editorial | awards — more than any agency or department of the United | States Government. The awards were presented to Louise Heskett for the Black Presence in the Era of the American Revolution | 1770-1800 by Sidney Kaplan (National Portrait Gallery); Nancy L. | Powars for Windows in the Sea by Marion Clayton Link (Fort | Pierce Bureau); Joan B. Horn for Report of the Mohawk-Hudson Area Survey edited by Robert M. Vogel (National Museum of History and Technology); Louise Heskett for Air Traffic Control: The Uncrowded Sky by Glen A. Gilbert (National Air and Space | Museum); Ernest E. Biebighauser for Continental Drift: The Evolution of a Concept by Ursula B. Marvin (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) ; and to John S. Lea for Form and Fire: Natzler Ceram-\ ics 1939-1972 by Otto Natzler (National Collection of Fine ArtsRenwick Gallery).
Louise Heskett was the recipient of the first Editor-of-the-Year award made by the Federal Editors Association.
Careful editing must be wedded to good design before a manu> script can be sent to the printer, and the Press’ dedicated design staff has also been honored during the year. In the 1974 annual exhibit of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington, which embraces both governmental and commercial graphic design, | Stephen J. Kraft was awarded the Gold Medal for Steinberg at the Smithsonian (National Collection of Fine Arts), and also received , Awards of Merit for President Monroe’s Message (National Portrait | Gallery) and Nicholas Copernicus (Office of Seminars). Shaker | (National Collection of Fine Arts-Renwick Gallery), designed by | Crimilda Pontes, has been chosen by the Association of American University Presses for excellence of design and production. It will be | on display at major universities throughout this country and, under '

the sponsorship of the United States Information Agency, in 26 countries abroad.
The Press’ major effort in fiscal 1974 has been in marketing and distribution, where exciting new programs for reaching a much broader audience for Smithsonian publications — both Federal and private — have been developed. Cooperating in these efforts are the American Library Association, Xerox University Microfilm, Microfilming Corporation of America, the Superintendent of Documents, and some of the country’s leading bookstore chains.
During the year, production costs of 124 publications were funded by Federal appropriations in the amount of $358,000; 7 trade publications were supported wholly by Smithsonian private funds in the amount of $105,700. The Press and the Superintendent of Documents shipped, on order and subscriptions, a total of
157,410 publications and 386 records. In addition, 1,506,972 art catalogues, brochures, leaflets, and miscellaneous items were distributed. A full list of Smithsonian Institution Press publications for fiscal year 1974 may be found in Appendix 7.

Smithsonian Year « 1974
HE SMOOTH OPERATION of a vast institution such as the Smithsonian epends in large measure on its administrative management. The mithsonian Institution — so viable in the civilizing process — must ave a firm basic administrative structure that is far-seeing yet effiient and reliable, if it is to fulfill its well-known mandate not only o disseminate knowledge but to increase knowledge. The reports hich follow concerning the Smithsonian’s Support Activities, inancial Services, Office of Audits, and International Exchange ervice recount an impressive array of activities in fiscal year 1974.
Support Activities
o augment his immediate staff of one Administrative Officer, the irector of Support Activities filled two other positions during the ear, a Special Assistant for programming and budgeting activities, nd a Programs Manager for special projects such as Smithsonianide programs in energy conservation, environmental protection, nd employee/ visitor parking.
The Smithsonian’s justification in the fiscal year 1975 budget request for additional support resources was well received. This important recognition stems from the program and priorities approach developed during the conference at Belmont in February of last year. Support activities across the Institution are moving forward in terms of obtaining more resources as well as in terms of redefining responsibilities of bureau directors for various support services provided in their respective buildings. Though this is encouraging, it is realized that the Institution still has some distance to go in

<<<Page: 266>>>

achieving its objective to provide quality support for all programs.
Many plans for Bicentennial requirements were completed during the year, and support was given to some programs already under way. Essential additional resources will be sought in the next budget cycle, the last opportunity to obtain adequate logistical support to carry through the Bicentennial programs.
Brief summaries of the major activities of the organizations in the central support group are given below.
Information Systems Division develops and coordinates the use of automatic data processing support throughout the Institution. Advances continued to be made through computer utilization in the areas of administration, management of the national collections, and scientific research. Research was conducted in optical character recognition for entering data directly from a printed page, terminal devices to enable telephone communication with the computer, and computer output to microfilm and microfiche, as well as plotted maps and other graphic presentations.
Individual research assistance to curators and scientists expanded and broadened in scope as the Division made available additional . mathematical techniques and software packages. New develop-— ments and refinements enhanced support for the management of the national collections in history, art, and science. A recently developed, but not yet completed, generalized information management package called setcem has aroused much attention within and outside the Institution because of its potential as a standard for the computerized management of collections. The Division publishes information about the sELGEM system in its technical bulletin, Smithsonian Institution Information Systems Innovations. The “Innovations” series acquaints the reader with automated systems and procedures specifically designed to solve collection and research | problems in museums and herbaria.
The three major responsibilities of the Management Analysis Office (MAO) are: providing management advisory and analysis services; making comprehensive reviews of proposed management issuances ,
252 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 267>>>

and coordinating their publication; and administering a forms management program.
In the first three quarters of the year, over 75 individual staff analyses and studies were completed, the majority of which culminated in management issuances covering new or revised policies and procedures on a variety of subjects.
In this same period, the Forms Management Section provided service to over 84 units of the Smithsonian. Unavoidable delays occurred in the implementation of the app program developed to support the management and control of Smithsonian forms. It is hoped that this program will be in successful operation by the third quarter of the forthcoming fiscal year.
In March, MAo acquired Videotype (word processing) equipment with which Smithsonian’s management issuances and other administrative documents can be prepared more efficiently and faster. This new technological development in the field of automatic typing can enhance not only MAo’s productivity but also that of the Institution as a whole.
Progress in the Smithsonian Institution’s Equal Employment Opportunity Program continued. Compliance with the complaints program was outstanding as complaints were processed without delay. The precomplaint counseling program, established in late 1972, functioned effectively. Of the more than 150 employees counseled, 9 formal complaints were filed and 8 were investigated. Of these 8, 2 were adjusted satisfactorily. Only 1 complaint proceeded to a hearing. The number of employees counseled, compared with those who filed formal complaints, demonstrates graphically the value of the complaints system.
A Sixteen-Point Program Coordinator was appointed and trained, and Upward Mobility Programs were implemented in the National Museum of Natural History and the Office of Plant Services.
The first member of a minority in a supergrade was appointed Assistant Secretary for Public Service and member of the Secretary’s Executive Committee.
The Office of Personnel Administration’s training course, “The Supervisor’s Role in Eko,” established last year, continued. Over
Administrative Management / 253

<<<Page: 268>>>

105 on-board and new supervisors have received this training, and! others will be scheduled to attend the monthly sessions. Eventually) all Smithsonian supervisors will take this course. ,
The Women’s Program evolved successfully. Bylaws were ap-|) proved for the Women’s Council; Council membership increased) from 9 to 15; and Smithsonian’s Women’s Week, held for the first’ time in October 1973, will be an annual event. .
The 1973 Priorities Conference at Belmont set forth the “need for) support activities to be organized and motivated to provide the best delivery of services to the program units and their managers.” In) addition, the conference discussions focused on the “creation of! better Institutional and bureau administrative awareness to accom-: modate anticipated future growth as a requirement.” Thus, based! upon the theme of the conference and succeeding executive determinations, the Office of Facilities Planning and Engineering Services; (oFPES) was established on October 26, 1973.
oFPEs serves the Smithsonian by providing professional advice’ and counsel to the Secretary, Executive Committee, and Bureau) Directors on matters pertaining to new construction and develop-: ment of the physical plant. Operational services furnished by oFPES include: (1) facilities planning and architectural review, (2) engineering and design development, and (3) construction contract management and cost evaluation. Projects planned, developed, and managed by orpes are accomplished primarily through the contract and procurement cycle, requiring extensive technical analysis and preparation of detailed plans, drawings, and specifications to attain maximum dollar return. During the year, orPes processed, reviewed, managed, or provided assistance for new construction projects for the Institution totaling $65 million. In addition, projects of an alteration, improvement, or restoration-renovation nature in the scope of orres’ activities during fiscal year 1974 entailed the expenditure of $5.5 million.
The more significant new construction projects in progress or completed during the year were: the National Air and Space Museum, scheduled for completion in fiscal 1976; the Hirshhorn
254 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 269>>>

useum and Sculpture Garden due to be completed early in fiscal year 1975; storage and program facilities at the Silver Hill complex; decking ranges in the Arts and Industries building to provide additional square footage; and the Exhibit Design and Production Laboratory at the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum. Major alteration, improvement, or restoration-renovation projects either initiated or completed during the year were: Arts and Industries building restoration and central air conditioning; Center for the Study of Man administrative area; renovation of the third floor and the Seventh Street corridor and air conditioning for the Fine Arts and Portrait Galleries; escalators for the Natural History building; and numerous other projects involving various galleries, exhibit areas, and special-purpose spaces for all major museums. orPEs also processed approximately 75 construction-oriented projects, with the load projected to increase significantly during the coming years. In addition to specific projects completed during the year, oFPES contributed to the long-range project-development program, particularly in the development and design areas, including the Museum Support Facility, Nation of Nations exhibit, Bicentennial planning, South Yard development, and the Jefferson Island bulkhead project.
| Among the services provided by the Office of Personnel Adminis}tration are manpower analysis, recruitment and placement, com}pensation programs, training and career development, employee | relations, labor-management relations, and special responsibilities in assuring equal opportunity. In addition, the Office bears respon}sibility for the implementation of new laws or policy, such as the } Fair Labor Standards Act, Public Law 93-259. _ Each of the major program areas experienced an increase in activlity deriving from the general growth of the Institution. Active }recruitment for new positions took place; a new, more formal, | position-classification program was begun; position-management | studies in the National Museum of Natural History were undertaken; and a number of employee problems were resolved. Upward | mobility assistance to employees was provided in several of the | museums through plans developed in conjunction with line manJ agers. These plans were devised to maximize individual skills
Administrative Management / 255

<<<Page: 270>>>

through training, job design, and other techniques, with particular emphasis on releasing employees from dead end or otherwise unsatisfying jobs.
Other positive approaches were taken to serve both managers and employees, notably those efforts extended by the task force to implement the reorganization of the former Buildings Management Department. Here, techniques were used which attempted to bring together to the greatest extent possible the needs of the Institution with the interests of individual employees.
Labor-management relations continued to function in a healthy way. Negotiations to modify an existing agreement were begun in one bargaining unit, and consultations and meetings were carried out in all units according to public policy and specific contracts. The grievance procedure negotiated in the union contracts was utilized in several instances, as both labor and management became accustomed to joint problem solving.
Twelve top managers received extended, in-depth, executivedevelopment training. Approximately 300 supervisors received inhouse training in two courses, the first dealing with the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and the second with the role of the supervisor in equal employment opportunity. In addition, a survey of supervisory skills was undertaken in order to plan for future training needs.
The Office of Plant Services was established in November 1973, following the restructuring of the former Buildings Management
Department. The new office is responsible for maintenance and
repair of the Smithsonian physical plant; operation of utilities systems; maintenance of communication, transportation, mail and messenger, and horticultural programs; grounds maintenance; and storage of the Smithsonian collections. It also is establishing and implementing standards of maintenance for the entire Institution.
The Crafts Services Division of the new office completed the following major projects during the year: restoring the fire-damaged Belmont Conference Center; constructing a new staff and public restaurant facility in the Fine Arts and Portrait Galleries; providing support to the Festival of American Folklife; completing modernization of the photographic laboratory, Arts and Industries

building; remodeling the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, History and Technology building; and installing a complete new lighting system in Building 10, Silver Hill Facility.
In late March, the Communications and Transportation Services Division was delegated the responsibility for the Smithsonian Mail and Messenger Service. Planning for the future of this major service was begun in April and is expected to result in better utilization
of resources, more efficient use of monies, and higher level service to the user.
Plans to relocate the Automotive Equipment Repair Shop from Building 1 to Building 7 at Silver Hill were completed during the year. When the relocation is accomplished in late 1974, a higher level of productivity is anticipated through the use of a more suit-
able work area.
The Horticultural Services Division undertook a number of Bi-
centennial projects during 1974, including design of a Victorian Garden for the South Yard, design for plantings in the Arts and Industries Conservatory, a State flower and State tree project, and a nursery-greenhouse operation. A National Horticultural Advisory Committee of prominent horticulturists and botanical garden and arboretum directors was established to assist in long-range programming, planning, and evaluation of future horticultural operations of the Smithsonian.
_ For the Warehousing Services Division, the first priority in 1974 was the cleanup of existing warehousing problems in Building 3, Alexandria, Virginia, and at the Silver Hill Facility in Maryland. In addition to assisting in office moves, the Division has been identifying storage and service problems, and training personnel in ) proper management of storage facilities.
| The Office of Printing and Photographic Services was established July 1, 1973, by combining the Photographic Services Division with the activities and personnel of the Smithsonian Institution Print Shop (Museum Branch, GPO) and the Duplicating Section. Acolor-processing facility was installed and, by September, is expected to be in full operation. The app production reporting system was activated and, as in 1973, the production of photographic materials increased greatly.

Again this year, the volume of photographic assignments increased. Approximately 4000 feet of movie film were taken of
various Smithsonian special events and construction sites. In addi-
tion, millions of pieces of documentary materials remain to be microfilmed. Modern lighting equipment was installed in the History
and Technology building studio. This improvement enhanced the
Branch’s capability to use special lighting techniques and effects for photographing accurately and artistically objects in the national collections.
A large project of 11,176 black-and-white prints was completed for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and 5588 new film negatives were made. New equipment was obtained
for the copy and printing sections. A new color section was estab-— lished with the purchase and installation of color equipment in the -
Arts and Industries building laboratory which was renovated for this purpose.
To support the app program, new forms were developed for obtaining caption data from the scientists and curators. Now 9485 index cards are available for retrieving information, and the most
popular subjects are filed and indexed by organization unit, subject —
matter, and key words. The Library Branch worked on 6900 re-
quests, including retrievals, inquiries, captions, and negative num.
bers; 3900 feet of movie film were filed; and 980 negatives (4” x 5”) of portraits and passports of Smithsonian officials are filed for ready reference.
More than 10,000 requests received from students, educators, scientists, and the general public were handled this year. In maximizing “the diffusion of knowledge” through the visual media, an
all-out effort was initiated to produce “SI Aids for Educational and
Cultural Enrichment.” Initially, these will be in the form of slide/ lectures for use in primary and secondary education. Staff members throughout the Institution and the Volunteer Ladies Committee of the Smithsonian Associates are participating actively in this program. In conjunction with the Smithsonian Museum Shops, slides in sleeves illustrating aircraft in the National Air and Space Mu-
seum and animals at the National Zoo were produced for sale. As — the slide program expands in the future, objects from other Smith-
sonian museums will be included.

The Office of Protection Services instituted daily safety and fire |
inspection tours and monthly fire equipment inspections. Prior to letting of contracts, the Health and Safety Division is reviewing all contemplated construction changes to consider safety and fire provisions for exits, lighting, floor surfaces, stairs, and ramps, and for fire detection/suppression needs.
The Smithsonian Institution was nominated for the President’s Safety Award for 1973. The Smithsonian has been nominated 7 times for this coveted honor and has won it twice. The Award for 1972 was presented this year by Secretary of Labor Brennan on the President’s behalf to Paul N. Perrot, Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, who accepted for Secretary Ripley and the Smithsonian. This was in recognition of the reduction of Smithsonian’s accident rate over a 3-year period and notably by 12 percent in 1971-1972. On March 5, 1974, Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks, in turn, presented the award to Richard L. Ault, Director of Support Activities.
During the year, 8 new exhibit halls requiring guard service were
opened to the public. Guards were furnished for 186 special events
held in various Smithsonian buildings. Among the prominent activ-
ities in which the guards participated were the visits of the President |
of Pakistan and the Empress of Iran. These participations included |
the security and escort of distinguished guests and the security activities of personnel present on the occasions.
During the year, 56 guard force personnel completed the basic security course including First Aid and Weapons Qualification and were commissioned as Special Policemen.
In October 1973, a special operational element designated as the
Outpost Detachment was activated and given the protection respon| sibility for the Renwick Gallery, Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, © and the facilities at Silver Hill, 24th Street, and Lamont Street. The | desired objective of improving security at these outlying establish|
ments is realized by the permanent assignment of personnel who |
make daily supervisory inspections of every location on each relief. The supervisors also are responsible for inspecting the quality of | security at separate locations where protection is carried out pri—
vately by the occupants or by contract security agencies. As addi-
260 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 275>>>

tional facilities are established that are not large enough to warrant activation of a new guard company, they too will be added to the Outpost Detachment’s area of responsibility.
All firstand second-line supervisors have completed the equal employment opportunity supervisory training course. During the
year, through reassignment and/or employment, 26 women were accepted for employment as security guards.
The Supply Division continued to experience increased procurement and contracting work loads primarily due to the general expansion of the Smithsonian Institution and its many related activities, and all indications point to future accelerated growth in both of these responsibilities.
The major procurements for the new Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden were accomplished during the year. Contracting is well under way for the special requirements and exhibits planned for the National Air and Space Museum which will open in 1976.
The Division also assumed responsibility for all construction contracted during the year, and its most significant accomplishment was the contract for major renovation of the Arts and Industries building which was in progress at year’s end.
The Division continued to be an active participant in the acquisition of useful excess Government property to satisfy the needs of the Institution’s many organization units. Excess property acquired this year was more than $500,000.
Again this year, the Travel Services Office (1ts0) experienced growth in all its major activities; i.e., air and rail reservations booked were up 40 percent; travel itineraries issued up 30 percent; transportation requests prepared up 25 percent; and the cost of transportation purchased from appropriated and nonappropriated funds was some 40 percent higher than last year.
In addition to furnishing travel services, advisory services and detailed planning data were provided for the annual Festival of American Folklife, for national and international conferences, and for meetings and archeological expeditions in Yugoslavia, Israel, Egypt, and Greece.

Of particular interest this year was a Travel Seminar sponsored by the Accounting Division for administrative staff of the Smith-| sonian. At the request of the Chief Accountant, the Chief of tTso\)
participated in the training sessions and explained the role of her’ office in providing travel services for official Smithsonian travelers.
During the year, a closer liaison had to be maintained with the. airlines to accomplish increasingly complex travel performed for! the Foreign Currency Program of the Office of International and Environmental Programs.
Financial Services
The Treasurer has overall responsibility for the financial assets of! the Smithsonian Institution. This includes the budgeting and accounting of federal appropriations, the fiscal administration of grants and contracts, and the monitoring of revenue-producing ’ activities; further detail on these activities is given in the reports. which follow on the Office of Programming and Budget, the Ac-. counting Division, the Grants and Insurance Administration Division, and the Business Management Office.
Working closely with the Investment Policy Committee of the Board of Regents, the Treasurer oversees the management of the endowment funds of the Institution by three professional advisory firms, and is also responsible for the short-term investment of current funds excess to immediate operating needs. Details on these funds and the other financial resources of the Institution can be found in the Financial Report at the front of this volume.
en nn
The Office of Programming and Budget participates in program planning for the Institution and, to carry out these plans, is responsible
for the formulation, presentation, implementation, and review of | operating and construction budgets of appropriated and nonappro| priated funds. About $100 million from many different sources were
involved this year. Details on these sources and their use may be found in the Financial Report. The Office works in close association with all operating and managerial levels of the Institution.
262 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 277>>>

During the year, the staff of seven persons engaged in the following activities. Detailed fiscal 1974 operating budgets and associated staffing plans for both federal and nonfederal funds were developed with some 75 individual organization units and programs. These ranged from the major museums and research laboratories to small , service and staff offices. Subsequently, throughout the year, these | budgets and plans were monitored and reviewed with the perform‘ing units to assure that program plans were accomplished within approved amounts. The uncertainty at the beginning of the year as _to whether several legislated pay raises would be financed with supplemental appropriations required special efforts to assure the wisest application of financial resources.
_ Based on the decision reached at the February 1973 Belmont Conference on Goals and Priorities (in which the Office was heavily involved) that emphasis must be given to strengthening the support
functions of the Institution, such as collections conservation and protection of buildings, the Office developed and presented to the President’s Office of Management and Budget a completely revised | format for the fiscal year 1975 budget. As compared with the traditional organizational unit presentation, the new format was programmatic in nature designed to show clearly the base capability and resource requirements of the support functions as well as the equally high priority of our Bicentennial Program commitments. _This budget presentation was received very favorably by the Office of Management and Budget and resulted in the Smithsonian being allowed to seek substantial additional appropriations for these needs _ from the Congress. The Office of Programming and Budget prepared and submitted to the Congress budget justifications and supporting documentation and prepared for and participated in the budget hearings before the House and Senate Appropriation Committees. Similar work was carried out on the fiscal year 1974 pay supplemental appropriation.
At the same time, the Office of Programming and Budget developed a more formal system for planning and goal-setting by each Smithsonian organization unit — now required by the expansion of the Institution, by the increasingly decentralized nature of much of ‘its activity, and by the growing complexity of administering its
diversified organizations.
Administrative Management / 263

<<<Page: 278>>>

In addition to the above Institution-wide responsibilities, the Office of Programming and Budget also engaged in a number of | special projects. It was involved intensively in the formulation and management review of fiscal years 1974 and 1975 budgets for the proposed Hillwood Museum. It developed a comprehensive Institution-wide exhibition plan, schedule, and budget. An inventory of Smithsonian buildings and facilities was prepared for the Board of Regents. Finally, the Office played major roles in the reorganizations of the Office of Exhibits and the Buildings Management Department.
The Accounting Division regularly handles and accounts for all funds of the Institution, both federal and nonfederal, including payrolls, payments for materials and services, and receipts from a great variety of sources, and in addition provides over 600 financial reports monthly to Institutional managers at unit and headquarters levels. Continuing the accounting services improvement program during fiscal 1974, the Accounting Division staff initiated and, with the assistance of other offices, conducted seminars on time-keeping and payroll, procurement and payment procedures, travel and vouchering procedures, and financial reporting. These seminars were attended by 200 Smithsonian administrative personnel including officers, assistants, clerks, and secretaries. With the assistance of our computer specialists, the Accounting staff installed a key-todisc data entry system to replace an inefficient card and paper tape system eliminating repetitious data processing and adding beneficial controls. The new system became operational May 1, 1974, with full implementation projected January 1, 1975. Additionally, installation in fiscal year 1974 of a new personnel time reporting procedure is also serving to speed and improve accuracy of payroll preparation.
The Grants and Insurance Administration Division is responsible for administration of gifts, grants, and contracts received by the Institution. In addition, this Division administers the Institution’s risk management and insurance program. The Division provides administrative, management, and fiscal services to Smithsonian researchers and the business representatives of granting agencies, as
264 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 279>>>

well as the controls necessary to assure that funds are expended in accordance with appropriate regulations and contract terms.
During the past year the Division has continued its excellent administration in the gift, grant, and contract area and at the same time has expanded its operations in the risk management and insurance area. This expansion has entailed the initiation of risk management surveys of various organizations and bureaus of the Smithsonian to identify risk and recommend ways of alleviating and protecting against such risks. In addition, collections insurance coverages throughout the Institution have been consolidated, resulting in reduced work loads and the saving of considerable funds through premium reductions.
In addition to having overall responsibility for the Museum Shops, the Product Development Program and the Belmont Conference Center, which are described below, the Business Management Office also advises other Smithsonian bureaus on the negotiation and monitoring of revenue-producing concessions and contracts. During the past year, for example, Business Management assisted on such diverse projects as the contracts for educational sound systems in the National Museum of Natural History and the Hirshhorn Museum, the competitive solicitation of food service and parking concessionaires for the new National Air and Space Museum, and the
construction of a new restaurant in the National Collection of Fine Arts and National Portrait Gallery building. The efforts of this office are an important element in the improvement of the Institution’s
nonfederal resources.
Museum Shops
The past year was one of growth and change for the Museum Shops.
For the first time sales climbed above $2 million, and net income reached the quarter-million mark. More importantly, 1974 saw the
laying of groundwork which will produce far greater benefits to our _Museums and visitors in the future.
Recognizing that the Shops should provide a means for a visitor to extend his museum experience, selection and display of merchandise has been drastically changed to provide increased educational values and a greater reflection of the museum in which a shop is
Administrative Management / 265

<<<Page: 280>>>

located. A leading architectural firm with extensive museum experience was retained to redesign completely the main shop in the National Museum of History and Technology — a project scheduled for completion by December 1974.
A number of important organizational changes were also made, with each shop manager being delegated responsibility for a specific area. A new position of Controller was created to provide greater inventory control and reports for management guidance. The Display Department was reorganized, and a new position was created in the Buying Department.
Product Development Program
The Product Development Program originated from efforts to improve the quality and relevance of items handled in the Museum Shops and as a means to bring to audiences other than the Smithsonian’s Washington visitors the educational values of the Institution.
As a part of this program, Tonka Corporation — a leading U.S. toy manufacturer with whom an agreement has been in effect since 1972, and under which it will manufacture and sell, in close coordination with Smithsonian, a line of museum-related products — introduced in fiscal year 1974 a series of diorama kits with a Smithsonian theme. These hobby/craft products effectively enable the builder to recapture a moment in history by creating an entire scene. Each kit is accompanied by a 24-page booklet containing detailed information on the historical period.
Similar agreements were reached during fiscal 1974 with three additional corporations. The first of these was with the Fieldcrest Company, which is developing bedspreads, quilts, comforters, blankets, sheets, and towels based on designs found in the Smithsonian collection items. Its trade introduction in May was well received, and products will reach the market in the fall of 1974. Another agreement was with the Stieff Company for a line of silver and pewter reproductions. The third was with the F. Schumacher Company, a producer of decorative fabrics and wall coverings.
Fiscal year 1974 also saw the introduction of Seeing the Smithsonian, the official guidebook to the Institution, in four foreign languages — French, German, Japanese, and Spanish. Mr. Kenneth Rush, then Deputy Secretary of State, spoke at the introductory
266 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 281>>>

ceremony. Due to the generosity of CBS/Publishing Group, the publisher of the guidebook, Seeing the Smithsonian is now available in braille at designated locations.
Belmont Conference Center
The Belmont Conference Center, located between the District of Columbia and Baltimore near Interstate 95, provides an attractive, secluded, gracious, and exclusive retreat unusual in the Eastern Corridor. Its easy access to the Baltimore-Washington airports, as well as to automotive arteries, impresses upon its guests the enjoyable paradox of a rural setting with the conveniences of urban proximity but without its complexities. One of the major advantages of Belmont is its use by only one group at any one time; schedules are so arranged as to avoid the overlap and attendant discomforts often encountered in other conference centers and hotels. Since its opening in 1967, conference operations have been directed toward the needs of small groups which require a location unencumbered by the normal intrusions associated with offices. The 240-year-old manor house, with 365 surrounding acres of lawns, forests, and fields, provides a working retreat for the productive groups which keep returning to the Center. Belmont can accommodate 24 in-house residents, with facilities _ for 10 to 12 additional guests, speakers, or observers for meals and "meeting sessions. This limiting size factor ensures that each confer_ence has the undivided and individual attention of the entire staff, as well as the opportunity for unusually close interaction within the _ meeting group itself. Of the 80 or so meetings which Belmont hosts _in a year, approximately 60 percent are from federally-funded agencies; the balance includes those from foundations and other philanthropic organizations, professional, religious, and social groups, corporations and private industry, and universities and colleges.
Office of Audits
During fiscal year 1974, the Office of Audits issued audit reports on the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, the Smithsonian Research Foundation, the National Zoological Park, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, Mail Management, the Mediterranean
Administrative Management / 267

<<<Page: 282>>>



<<<Page: 283>>>

Marine Sorting Center, the Smithsonian Institution Press, the Travel Services Office, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. Audit recommendations made in these reports have resulted in improved management procedures and controls, sometimes pointing to potential dollar savings.
In addition, the Office of Audits completed various pre-award and post-audits of contracts, and closed out 26 foreign currency grants in the amount of $1 million.
International Exchange Service
The International Exchange Service is the one program bureau in the support activities group. In 1851, the Smithsonian Institution established the international exchange system to provide a means for exchanging current Smithsonian publications for the transactions and proceedings of institutions in other countries. Other learned bodies in the United States were allowed to participate by exchanging their publications with those of foreign organizations. This program has continued through the years and, by this method, /many colleges, universities, scientific societies, and medical and | dental libraries exchange their current and duplicate publications with similar organizations in other countries.
During the year, over 700,000 pounds of publications were received from more than 250 organizations in the United States for transmission through the Service to over 100 countries. Publications weighing approximately 500,000 pounds were forwarded by ocean freight to 38 exchange bureaus in 32 countries. Approximately 250,000 pounds of publications were mailed to the intended recipients in countries that do not have exchange bureaus.
Publications weighing approximately 90,000 pounds were re-
ceived from exchange bureaus in other countries for distribution in
the United States.
Over 700,000 official United States publications weighing ap-
proximately 350,000 pounds were received for 91 organizations in 62 countries in exchange for the official publications of those countries. The daily issues of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register were exchanged with 126 foreign libraries in 62
countries for the parliamentary journals of these countries.

Smithsonian Women’s Council
The Smithsonian Women’s Council was established by the Secretary in 1972 to represent to the Smithsonian’s leadership the concerns of women at the Institution regarding employment and related matters.
During its first full term of existence in 1973-1974, the Council undertook several major projects. Its Child-care Committee acted on indications from employees that employer child-care assistance was of concern to them and on the evidence that Smithsonian resources could make special contributions to the development and education of children in general through progams conducted for employees’ children. Based on information from a wide variety of sources, the Women’s Council prepared a proposal in the fall of 1973 for an experimental program, providing for hiring a specialist in child care and development programming. After an initial assignment of designing an information-exchange service for employees concerned with child care, the specialist would move on rapidly to the development and execution of a summer educational — program for school-age children and finally the presentation of recommendations for the Smithsonian’s future role in the care — and education of its employees’ children. Administrative and financial elements were settled during the following winter and in the late spring of 1974 recruiting for the position of Child-care Coor— dinator began. The Assistant Secretary for Public Service assumed overall responsibility for the program with assistance from an advisory board representing the Women’s Council and the Offices of Museum Programs, Personnel Administration, Equal Opportunity, and the Treasurer.
Another Council committee, formed to study patterns of recruitment, employment, and promotion at the Smithsonian, analyzed the Smithsonian’s Merit Promotion Program and the skills-file method currently in use in internal recruiting for clerical and secretarial positions and offered recommendations for elimination of inequities in these systems and improvement of their operation. The report and recommendations were submitted to the Directors of Personnel Administration and Equal Opportunity in April 1974.
Other committees of the Council have been and are engaged in widely varied activities. One conducted studies and analysis of the
270 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 285>>>

Institution’s Upward Mobility Program and submitted to Personnel Administration and Equal Opportunity recommendations for significant changes and expansion in that area. Another committee sponsored a lecture on “The Job Jungle” by career-development expert Alexander Methven, which drew 170 employees and guests. Yet another committee is developing plans for a rich variety of programs and exhibits to mark Women’s Week in August 1974.

Smithsonian Year 1974
THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART, although formally established as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, is an autonomous and separately administered organization. It is governed by its own Board of Trustees, the statutory members of which are the Chief Justice of the United States, Chairman; the Secretary of State; the Secretary of the Treasury; and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
_ tion, all ex officio; and five general trustees. Paul Mellon continued
as president of the Gallery and John Hay Whitney as vice president.
_ The other general trustees continuing to serve were Dr. Franklin
D. Murphy and Stoddard M. Stevens. In March 1974, Mr. Lessing J. Rosenwald resigned after ten years as a trustee; Mr. Carlisle H. Humelsine, President of Colonial Williamsburg, was elected to succeed him.
During the fiscal year 1974 the Gallery had over 1,263,690 visitors.
A number of important works of art were acquired. Of particular note were the paintings: Paul Cézanne’s Houses in Provence and Paul Gauguin’s Te Pape Nave Nave, gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon. The year was also noteworthy because of the acquisition of numerous and important sculptures including Pietro Tacca’s The Pistoia Crucifix, Antonio Canova’s Hercules Slaying Lichas, two works by Foggini: Bacchus and Ariadne and Venus and Cupid, and two highly significant twentieth-century works: Wilhelm Lehmbruck’s Seated Man and Alberto Giacometti’s The Invisible Object.
In the graphic arts the Gallery added 96 drawings, 306 etchings and 2,057 prints to its collections, with many outstanding works, spanning six centuries from The Adoration of the Magi by the

<<<Page: 288>>>

Master E S, to a comprehensive collection of the works of M. C. Escher.
Notable exhibitions held at the Gallery included: “Etchings by’ Rembrandt” and “Prints of the Italian Renaissance” (both continued from fiscal year 1973). “American Impressionist Painting,” “Sixteenth Century Italian Drawings from the Collection of Janos Scholz,” “American Art at Mid-Century I,” “Francois Boucher in North American Collections: 100 Drawings,” “Nineteenth-Century Sculpture” and “Recent Acquisitions and Promised Gifts: Sculpture, Drawings, Prints.” A particularly innovative major exhibition was opened in May 1974, “African Art and Motion,” which through the objects shown, video tape and recordings of ceremonial African dancers and music, presented an integrated experience in the culture of sixteen African countries. |
The Gallery’s multimedia education program, Art and Man, published in cooperation with Scholastic Magazines, Inc., reached 4,000 classrooms in every state of the country.
The total number of bookings of Extension Service materials, film strips, slide lectures, and films was 29,999. The total estimated attendance covering all 50 states and many foreign countries and United States military installations abroad was nearly five million.
Total attendance at talks given by the Gallery’s Education Depart-_ ment and at the programs presented in the auditorium was 120,338. These included the regularly scheduled auditorium lectures and films, the Introduction to the Collection, the Tour of the Week, and Painting of the Week. There were 35 guest lecturers including the twenty-third annual A. W. Mellon Lecture in the Fine Arts, Professor H. W. Janson, who gave a series of six lectures entitled “Nineteenth-Century Sculpture Reconsidered”; and A. B. de Vries, Director Emeritus of the Mauritshuis (Royal Gallery of Paintings), the Kress Professor in Residence.
The newly recruited Conservation Department, working without the benefit of the expanded laboratory facilities still in the planning stage, concentrated on a survey of the Gallery’s Northern European paintings with particular attention to those of Vermeer.
The Gallery’s art research project at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh neared its twenty-fifth anniversary and continued its work in nuclear methods of analysis and mass spectroscopy. Under

a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, matched by private donors, a three-year project was launched to produce a series of handbooks on the characterization and analysis of artists’
pigments’ sources and ages. Both projects are under the direction |
of Dr. Robert M. Feller.
In contrast to the previous year (1973), which saw much activity
in terms of new staff, new acquisitions, and new procedures, the
Library this year concentrated on stock-taking, classification and
reclassification, inventory, and reorganization. The complete inven— tory is the first to be undertaken in the Library’s thirty-three-year _
history. A total of 3,973 books and pamphlets were added to the collection, 2,070 purchased, 1,195 received as gifts, and 708 obtained —
via exchange; 74,128 new photographs were added to the Photographic Archives.
During the year the Gallery produced three exhibition catalogues on the Sixteenth Century Italian Drawings from the Collection of Janos Scholz, Francois Boucher in North American Collections: 100 Drawings, and Recent Acquisitions: Sculpture, Drawings, Prints. As an alternative to a catalogue for the “American Art at MidCentury I” exhibition, a portfolio of thirty-three, 8” x 10” full-color reproductions with text was produced —a first for the National Gallery. Two posters were also produced for sale. Continued public interest in the Gallery’s reproductions, postcards, and art books was evidenced by the patronage of 292,883 people in person and 8,736 by mail.
The Concert Programs continued with 40 Sunday evening concerts in the East Garden Court which were well attended and also broadcast live on a local AM-rM station.
The past year has seen the dramatic thrust of the East Building from the ground to levels ranging from the third to the sixth floor. In May the first exterior marble was set. Occupation and opening exhibits are planned for the summer of 1977.
Substantial progress was also made on the “Connecting Link”:
area between the East and West Buildings. A radically revised plaza design was developed, with glass tetrahedrons forming architectural sculpture on the plaza and‘serving as skylights for the concourse level below. This portion of the work, including an enlarged cafeteria, will be open to the public in the summer of 1976.

Smithsonian Year « 1974
FACED WITH THE perennial challenge of surpassing previous efforts, the Kennedy Center opened its third season with an unprecedented four-week festival: Shakespeare and the Performing Arts. In keeping with basic philosophy that Center festivals must make an artistic statement of unique importance, the month-long celebration was designed to illustrate Shakespeare’s profound influence on all aspects of the performing arts.
Utilizing virtually every part of the building, the festival included drama, dance, opera, symphony and chamber concerts, jazz, and film. The Center’s unique structure, with four theaters under one roof, provided an extraordinary opportunity for comparative study, as, for example, Macbeth was presented in its traditional dramatic form in the Eisenhower Theater, while Verdi’s operatic adaptation was simultaneously staged in the Opera House, and two different film interpretations were offered in the American Film Institute | Theater. Similarly, readings from Shakespeare were coupled with stunning ballet passages they have inspired.
During a special opening salute, activity extended even beyond the walls of the Center, as Handel’s Water Music was performed _ antiphonally by musicians on the river terrace and on a barge afloat the Potomac.
Participating in the festival were such outstanding performers as Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Sir Michael Redgrave, Maurice Evans, Zoe Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Charlton Heston, Natalia Makarova, and Cleo Laine.

The artistic and popular success of the festival opening carried over and remained constant throughout the season that followed. Audience support surpassed all previous years as over 1.7 million people attended performances, and the vitality of the performing arts in Washington was graphically illustrated by the fact that the Opera House was in full operation for 50 weeks, the Eisenhower Theater for 52 weeks, and the Concert Hall for 52 weeks.
The season ultimately included: 125 performances of dance, by distinguished companies from around the world; 160 symphony | concerts, including 129 by the resident National Symphony Orchestra; 42 performances of 15 operas; 37 recitals; 30 chamber concerts; | 23 choral concerts; 44 concerts of popular music, folk, jazz, and | rock; and 671 performances of drama and musical comedy. |
In an expanded schedule, the Opera Society of Washington pre| sented a total of five productions, including the American premiere of Monteverdi's I] Ritorno D’Ulisse, and the New York City Opera’s annual spring visit featured peformances of seven different works.
In addition to return engagements of the American Ballet Theatre — and the National Ballet, the Center welcomed for the first time the New York City Ballet and Britain’s Royal Ballet. |
Theatrical highlights included a standing-room-only, post-Broadway engagement of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire, with Lois Nettleton and Alan Feinstein; shattering performances by | Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards in Eugene O’Neill’s A Moon for the Misbegotten, directed by Tony Award-winner Jose Quintero; Deborah Kerr’s recreation of her London triumph in Frank Harvey’s The Day After the Fair; David Turner’s The Prodigal Daughter, | starring Wilfred Hyde-White; Kate Reid’s moving performance in | Brian Friel’s The Freedom of the City; Anthony Quayle’s powerful | portrayal of a contemporary Russian writer in Henry Denker’s | The Headhunters; the premiere of Erich Maria Remarque’s Full Circle, directed by Otto Preminger; and Samuel Taylor’s delightful | comedy, Perfect Pitch, with Tammy Grimes and Jean-Pierre‘ Aumont. |
In a unique arrangement, and what is hoped will prove the first | of many such examples of mutual cooperation between the Center and American colleges and universities, the entire cast of The Headhunters spent a week performing at the University of Tennessee, | prior to opening in Washington. During their stay in Knoxville, '

director-star Anthony Quayle and others associated with the production conducted a series of seminars and workshops which were open to the entire academic community. Of particular significance was the fact that students and faculty of the drama department were able to observe work on professional production, prior to its opening in their theater.
The most significant theatrical event of the season, and the Center’s most ambitious undertaking since the 1971 opening of Leonard Bernstein’s Mass, was the American premiere of Tom Stoppard’s Jumpers. In a dazzling display, Stoppard combined both physical and philosophical gymnastics to produce one of the most literate and entertaining plays the theater has witnessed in the past decade. Directed by Peter Wood and starring Brian Bedford and Jill Clayburgh, Jumpers played the Eisenhower for an unprecedented eight weeks and went on to a limited Broadway engagement.
During the course of the season, the Center also presented a delightful series of musicals — including revivals of two classics: The Pajama Game, with Barbara McNair, Cab Calloway, and Hal Linden, and Good News, with Alice Faye and John Payne — Stephen Sondheim’s award-winning A Little Night Music, and a highly successful engagement of I Do! I Do!, starring Carol Burnett and Rock Hudson.
Of particular artistic importance was the presentation in May of a three-week Mozart Festival, conceived and developed by the Center’s Music Director, Julius Rudel. A series of 44 performances, 14 of which were free, illustrated the full range of Mozart’s genius
and featured both familiar works and lesser known, rarely performed selections. Highlighting the festival was the American premiere of a revised edition of the opera Idomeneo.
In a special community outreach, festival programming included | a number of outstanding concerts at the Smithsonian and in area churches, and in conjunction with the Center’s activities, the Music Critics Association conducted institutes dealing with Mozart authen-
ticity, special Mozart performance problems, and Mozart opera.
The following month, in a dramatic three-century leap, the Center played host to Art Now ’74, a celebration of contemporary American art and artists. Art Now, produced by the Artrend Foun-
dation, utilized the entire roof terrace level and focused primarily /upon performance and post-object art, stressing the most adven-

turous of current art trends. Interdisciplinary in nature, it included the visual arts, dance, music, video, film, theater, and works outside the realm of conventional classification.
Throughout the year, the Center’s vitally important educational role expanded through the continued growth of the Alliance for Arts Education (AAE). The Alliance, a joint project of the Center and the Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, was established in 1973, to make the Center’s programs, facilities, and services more accessible to students as participants and performers; to stimulate, at local, state, and regional levels, quality programs in which all the arts are included as an integral part of the education of all students; and to establish the Center as a focal point for strengthening the arts in education at all levels.
With the support of representatives of the President’s Advisory ‘Committee on the Arts, the Friends of the Kennedy Center, and national, state, and local officials, the Alliance established committees in over 40 states. These state committees provide a forum and a communication center for arts and education organizations working to achieve the objectives of Aare programs. In the fall of 1973, a Center-hosted aat conference provided a unique opportunity for significant exchange between educators and arts administrators from all 50 states. | As a part of an Alliance “showcase” series, several states presented outstanding representative educational programs at the Center during the spring. These included an appearance of the Golden Spike Youth Orchestra of Utah, a poets-in-the-schools project from New York, an exhibition of photographs and poems by Sioux Indian children of South Dakota, and a workshop on the arts for the mentally retarded. A total of 17 showcase activities are scheduled for the summer of 1974.
The sixth annual American College Theatre Festival, presented by the Center and the Smithsonian and produced by the American Theatre Association, brought ten of the Nation’s finest college productions to the Eisenhower Theater during a two-week period in April. As a part of a new playwriting project, two original stuident works were among the productions staged.
In cooperation with the Music Educators National Conference, the aar is developing plans for an American University Music Festival, to be similar in scope to the College Theatre Festival.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts / 283

<<<Page: 298>>>

In addition to its AAE-oriented activities, the Center welcomed over 55,000 Washington-area school children to a series of special performances sponsored by the wives of Cabinet members and performing arts organizations within the city.
The ongoing Special Ticket Program enabled over 135,000 people to attend regular Center performances at half-price. The program, which is available to students, the handicapped, retired people living on fixed incomes, limited-income groups, and military personnel in grades E-1 through E-4, reflects the Center’s concern that its performances be accessible to all, regardless of economic circumstances.
Under the chairmanship of Mrs. J. Willard Marriott, the 121member President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts continued to advise and assist in Center activities. During the year, the Advisory Committee was particularly active in fund-raising activities and in the development of the Alliance for Arts Education.
The Friends of the Kennedy Center, established as an auxiliary organization in 1966, grew to include over 10,000 members from all parts of the country. Volunteers from the Friends have generously contributed thousands of hours of time and effort, conducting public tours, managing souvenir stands, and providing hospitality and other services to Center operations and functions. Working closely with the National Park Service, the Friends have | provided visitor services to over two million sightseers annually. Activities of the Friends are directed by Mrs. Polk Guest, who has served as chairman since 1967.
Charged by Congress with responsibility for maintaining the Center as a national memorial, the National Park Service has carried out vital maintenance, security, and information functions. The daily efforts of National Park Service personnel within the building and throughout the 17-acre site add immeasurably to the enjoyment of sightseers and theatergoers alike.
During its three years of operation, the Center has housed companies headed by universally recognized theatrical personalities as well as little-known college ensembles. Plays, operas, and ballets have been created and molded within its walls. As the fourth season approaches, with concrete plans and ambitious goals reaching well into the future, the Center and its role as a living memorial continue to evolve.

Smithsonian Year + 1974
ATE IN 1968, the Congress determined that the official national memorial to the 28th President of the United States should be — uniquely among monuments to heads of state anywhere in the world so far as we are aware — a “living memorial.”
| The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars seeks to commemorate both the scholarly depth and the public concerns of Wilson through a program of advanced research and communication between the world of ideas and the world of affairs. Center activities and aims can be discussed in terms of the three basic ingredients of higher learning in a democracy: people, ideas, and communication — people who can think, ideas that matter, and communication that gets through.
Finding and supporting the gifted individual to conduct research on subjects of fundamental importance is the primary concern of the Center. The majority of Center fellows are selected on the basis of open competitions, which are held twice yearly. Last year the program accommodated 48 fellows and 5 guest scholars from 14 countries. Since the Center commenced its activities three years ago, it has welcomed 118 fellows from 27 countries for ranging scholarly research, along with 34 shorter-term guest scholars. The Center has had almost as many foreign as American fellows — bringing them together in a small group of no more than 40 at any

<<<Page: 302>>>

given time. If the company and its perspective are global, the scale is human and the enterprise hopefully humane.
In its selection procedures the Center relies deeply on panels whose composition reflects the fact that higher scholarship in America is heavily concentrated in universities. Fellowships are not, however, confined to academics and are not designed for the perfection of narrow specialties or private languages. Any scholar with a major project in view that can make fruitful use of the rich resources of the Washington area is welcome to apply. Fellowships are awarded by three broad divisional panels: Natural Resources and Political Economy; Social Studies; and Historical and Cultural Studies.
Since the Center is free from traditional academic calendars and departmental structures and deals only in free, individual research, the opportunities are rich for the imaginative and cross-disciplinary scholar and for a creative mix of specialties and backgrounds. The Center is attempting to encourage depth in its scholarship by focusing on the historical, philosophical, and comparative dimensions of questions that matter for civilization.
Much of the work at the Center has taken place in special subject areas within the broader scholarly divisions — research on patterns of sustainable economic growth and on the law of the sea and uses of the oceans within the division of natural resources and political economy, and studies of problems of the international order and the American system of government within the social studies division. Two new special programs in the latter division will bring (1) distinguished historians from abroad to work in Washington on the American Revolution as a world event, and | (2) thoughtful practitioners from state and local governments in the United States to write a series of studies on the problems and prospects of the American federal system. .
While there are clusters of scholars with such common interests, the unifying force within the Center is the common scholarly commitment of fellows, ‘guest Scholars, and senior staff alike to what Wilson himself once described as “the passionate search for dispassionate truth.”
288 / Smithsonian Year 1974

<<<Page: 303>>>

Attempts to communicate between the world of ideas and the world of public affairs arise from the commission to serve as a “living memorial” to a President who bridged both worlds. The Center has the opportunity to perform a kind of switchboard function, making connections between the research materials of the Washington area, people at the Center, and the public sector in Washington.
On the basis of past experience and present assets, the Center has sought recently to encourage both broadened dialogue between scholarship and the public sector and expanded use of the unmatched scholarly resources of the Washington area. Evening dialogues, colloquia on work in progress, and occasional conferences are sponsored by the Center as ways of communicating scholarship within and beyond the Washington community — above and beyond the publishing of the scholarly writings undertaken and produced by Center fellows.
