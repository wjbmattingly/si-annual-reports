Appendix 7
Donors to the Smithsonian Institution in Fiscal Year 1990
The Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian join with the entire staff in thanking all of the Institution’s friends for the generosity they have shown with their financial support, gifts to the collections, and in-kind donations. All gifts are listed according to type; within each category names of donors are recorded under the ttle of the recipient bureau or office, with a brief description of the gift where appropriate. If perchance the name of any donor has been omitted from these lists, it is an inadvertence and in no way diminishes the Institution’s gratitude. Many gifts were received from donors who prefer to remain anonymous; the Smithsonian wishes to thank these people, as well, for their support.
