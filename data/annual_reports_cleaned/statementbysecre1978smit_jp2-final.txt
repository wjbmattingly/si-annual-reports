The Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

IN MY STATEMENT for Smithsonian Year 1977 (pages 19-21) I summarized the results of reviews of the Institution’s operations conducted by the General Accounting Office (Gao) and by the Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents. Recommendations resulting from those reviews dealt largely with actions to improve the accountability of the Smithsonian to the Congress and to strengthen its internal management. In response to these studies, a number of actions have been taken by the Board of Regents and the staff of the Institution over the past year. We have, for example, developed alternative administrative procedures for the research and education programs previously administered by the Smithsonian Research Foundation. The Foundation itself is in abeyance. The matter of the future status of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, including its organizational placement, was referred to the Office of Management and Budget (oms) where it has been taken up by the President’s Reorganization Project. For our part we have felt that we could not take unilateral action to dissolve the Exchange from its present corporate status, given its history and purpose. By year end, it appeared that the omB and the Congress had agreed to transfer the Exchange to the Department of Commerce as a more appropriate affiliation, given that Department’s other responsibilities for the management of technical data.
Concerning other matters raised by the cao, the Institution has strengthened its procedures for providing full information to the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress on the sources and expenditures of grant, contract, and trust funds at the time that federal budgets are submitted. We have developed policy statements on the use of federal and trust funds. Meanwhile the Congressional appropriations committees have developed and issued revised procedures for all agencies to allow a systematic approach to making necessary adjustments during the year to congressionally approved amounts of funds for individual organization units or projects.
Actions are well along on all the recommendations in the Regents’ Audit and Review Committee report, which was accepted by the full Board of Regents at its September 27, 1977, meeting. A policy of seeking specific authorization for all significant new programs and projects potentially involving the use of federal funds

<<<Page: 14>>>

the provision of full budget information on the sources and applications of funds (with special emphasis on those cases where proposed uses of trust funds could result in the need for appropriations) would appear to help establish the Institution’s status and to assure full and timely information and accountability to the Congress. Furthermore, we explained that we foresaw problems in actions that would change the status of our trust-fund employees given the well-defined personnel management system under which these employees now work, the low number of conversions (criticized in the report) between the trust and federal systems which are reviewed carefully, the fact that many of the trust-fund employees are assigned to the auxiliary activities, and our complete willingness to make all financial and personnel information available for review. We feel most strongly that efforts possibly resulting in a change to the Institution’s character would have serious consequences with regard to the public’s perception of the Institution and their continued generosity in supporting it with important objects for the national collections, with gifts and bequests of funds for special and unrestricted purposes, and with support through the Associates’ program.
It was further recommended that the Smithsonian Institution submit future federal appropriation requests with comparative private fund availability projections on a side-by-side basis for the Committee’s consideration in determining federal funding levels. We replied that for several years, the Institution has provided, as an appendix to the federal budget justification to the Congress, bureau-by-bureau information on comparative appropriations, federal grants and contracts, and trust fund expenditures for the preceding fiscal year. Recognizing, however, that these historical data were of limited help for a review of the proposed federal budget, we had already provided trust fund projections to the Congress prior to receiving this recommendation. This information will be updated each year and, with the five-year outlook, should afford the basis for a full review of the Institution’s programs and resource requirements. We will provide whatever additional information is required by oms and the Congress to enable those bodies to exercise their oversight responsibilities.
The investigative staff made two recommendations that they felt would strengthen internal management and congressional over-

<<<Page: 15>>>

sight. They recommended that the Board of Regents publish a set of bylaws that would contain specific thresholds for management discretion in Smithsonian Institution program and project initiation, reprogramming of private funds from activities specified in the budget, establishment of a definitive program funding source policy, and a mechanism for Regents’ approval of organizational change. The bylaws should also specify the authorities vested in the Executive Committee as well as the full Board of Regents. This study recommended that the appointment of members of the Board of Regents be limited to twelve years or two consecutive terms, to increase Regent participation, and to provide additional periodic policy and program stimulation. At its meeting on September 25, 1978, the Board of Regents gave preliminary consideration to the matter of bylaws and also discussed possible dates for meetings in the ensuing year. The Board also requested the Regents to consider whether they wished to prescribe a limitation on terms of service of the nine citizen regents to two consecutive six-year terms or twelve years.
As a final recommendation, the Investigation Staff suggested that the Committee consider authorizing the Smithsonian Institution to continue to compete as a “private’’ educational activity for grants and contracts from federal, state, local, and private organizations, and authorizing a research grant award program with specified internal and external peer review to encourage and stimulate the continued research endeavors of the Institution. In our response, we note that, except for limitations recently established by the Appropriations Committees (i.e., seeking grants from the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities), the Institution has authority to compete for many grants and contracts. The Smithsonian strongly concurred with the recommendation for a competitive research awards program, based on our continuing system of objective, external peer review.
As I noted a year ago, this period of reviews of the Institution’s policies and operations has been most helpful. It has afforded us opportunities to examine and strengthen some of our procedures. The explanations that we have provided the Congress have helped to clarify the nature of the Smithsonian. Our efforts will continue to keep the oms and the Congress fully informed of our activities and plans. In this time of searching scrutiny of almost everything

for which he is highly qualified. Similarly John Dobkin, our effective administrative officer of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, has left us for the significant post of Director of the National Academy of Design, and John Whitelaw, the equally effective administrative officer of the National Air and Space Museum, has left to become the Deputy Chairman for Management at the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Two of the important galleries of the Institution either celebrated or will celebrate Tenth Anniversaries this year, both in the same building, formerly the Patent Office in Washington. Their opening date was from 1968, although the National Collection of Fine Arts is an old bureau, dating back to the commencement of this century. The National Portrait Gallery, only chartered in 1962, has had similarly ten years of visibility in this splendid, redecorated building. Both museums, the one a stimulating panorama of American art, the other one of the most important historical documentation centers in the nation, share with the Archives of American Art what has now become a very crowded building indeed.
We have beseeched the General Services Administration, the cultural advisors of the President, and our Congressional friends, for assistance in recognizing this problem for which a perfect solution lies at hand: the adjacent period building across F Street, presently the home of the International Trade Commission. Connected by underground tunnels, the building could serve as an ideal museum and curation area, and we earnestly hope that, in a solemn and stately manner, an appropriate game of musical chairs can be played to find a new home for our friends of the International Trade Commission, so that a leavening of space can reward our own two splendid museums.
Elsewhere in this annual report and indeed in the newspapers, magazines, and accounts across the land, this year has been celebrated by the opening of the most splendid museum edifice created in a generation, the new East Building of the National Gallery of Art. Opened to critical acclaim, this trapezoidal structure sets a capstone to the gallery space on the Mall. It will be a fascinating, popular attraction for many years to come. The East Building represents a special tribute to the persistence and courage of Andrew Mellon’s children, the late Mrs. Ailsa Mellon Bruce, and the President of the Board of the Gallery, Paul Mellon. Few men in this gen-

horn had two major exhibitions of great quality, while the National Museum of History and Technology opened its new Maritime Hall, and the National Museum of Natural History completed its hall of the history of early human endeavors at aggregations and civilization. In the latter connection it could be said that this is a continuing process for mankind.
Important acquisitions by gift and purchase rained in upon us this year, not least of which was the gift of a major part of the first balloon which managed to cross the Atlantic with three intrepid passengers. Appropriately, it reached our National Air and Space Museum, which celebrates the history of ballooning so effectively as part of our history of human flight.
In April 1784, General George Washington wrote to one of his war-time colleagues, the French engineer M. Duportail, regarding balloon aeronautics (for the French were the leaders in this field at the time): “. . . I have only newspaper accounts of the Air Balloons, to which I do not know what credence to give as the tales related of them are more marvellous and lead us to expect that our friends at Paris in a little while, will come flying through the air, instead of ploughing the ocean to get to America, .. .” A foresighted thought, for our General was merely 194 years ahead of his time.
Much of our research, and a detailed list of publications as well as collections acquisitions will be found in the cognate volume of the Annual Report under the sections on science, history and art, public service, and museum programs, but one project should be singled out as a major step in reinforcing our understanding of the decline of human environments on the planet. This is the work of Farouk El-Baz, research director in our National Air and Space Museum, in the interpretation of space photographs for mapping the advance of deserts as against the possibility of reclaiming land in overpopulated countries of the desert belts of the world. So important is this work that the Egyptian President, Mr. Sadat, has requested that Dr. El-Baz serve in an adjunct capacity as Science Advisor to that government, a position we are delighted to endorse.
It is a paradox that as the Smithsonian has engaged in research in Egypt in the past dozen years involving hundreds of research projects, supported with counterpart dollar funds deposited in Egyptian pounds, as we have undertaken the United States support

<<<Page: 19>>>

of the international campaign for the salvage of Nubian monuments, especially Philae, as we are so recognized internationally that our research workers travel freely during times of tension such as the Six-Day War, so now there is a drying up of funds available in Egypt for our work. At the same time the governments of Israel and Egypt, even now negotiating a fragile peace, a priority of the highest kind, think of searching for an impartial organization of their common basic science interests in the vast expanse of desert that lies between their borders. The Smithsonian can play its part in the international reassurance that such science serves to play, and has in the past in other places. We should be recognized as such a force for civilized life and activity at all times.
Years ago Mark Twain, in his Innocents Abroad, characterized us as the recipient “’. . . of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the Smithsonian Institute (sic), .. .” Come then in 1978 to our Victorian Garden on the south facade of the original “castle” building, where now on the parterre are ornamental purple and green cabbages surrounding the new statue of Spencer Fullerton Baird, second Secretary of the Institution, and see how old, useless, mildewed, and naive we are. I daresay there is not a better example of persistent style in all Washington than this fossil-studying Institution, Mr. Clemens!

Trustees of the Museum on terms consistent with the recommendations of the ad hoc Committee of the Regents and to accept the instrument of donation as contained in the legislation.
Stemming from a 1961 bequest to the Institution, an apartment building was authorized to be sold and the net proceeds placed in the Atherton Seidell Endowment fund, the income of which is to be used to make “the published results of scientific research more widely available to those able to use them for the advancement of science,” as stipulated by the donor.
Legislative measures introduced in the Ninty-sixth Congress included a bill to authorize construction of the Museum Support Center; a bill transferring to the Library of Congress responsibility for the distribution of United States Government publications to foreign governments and institutions; and a bill to increase the amount of appropriations authorized for Barro Colorado Island.
The Institution accepted an invitation from the Institute for Advanced Study to join with the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Institute of Physics, the National Academy of Sciences, Princeton University, and others, as an honorary sponsor of the Einstein Symposium at Princeton in March of 1979. The Smithsonian will also schedule kindred activities in Washington at the same time.
The Regents received reports concerning acquisitions of the National Collection of Fine Arts Commission, the National Portrait Gallery Commission, and the Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.
The Secretary reported that the Regents had ratified action taken to develop a general interest book entitled The Smithsonian Experience, which was published and sold very well. Two other books, tentatively titled A Flash of Genius: The Smithsonian Book of Invention and Innovation and The Magnificent Foragers, were scheduled for feasibility studies.
The Secretary and the Regents discussed possible acquisition of the Tariff (Trade) Commission Building, when the current occupants no longer require use of the building, to provide for the future needs of the National Collection of Fine Arts, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Archives of American Art.
Further study of the development of Mall underground garages indicated various methods of financing the project, and the Regents agreed that the study should be continued.

<<<Page: 21>>>

The Secretary described the legislation introduced in the House and Senate to authorize the Smithsonian to acquire the Museum of African Art. Hearings held by the Senate Committee on Rules and
Administration included such witnesses as Senator Muriel Hum-
phrey, Senator Hayakawa, and former Senator Moss, as well as the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the Director of the Museum of African Art. The legislation was reported favorably and action by the House is expected soon.
In the early 1970s planning had begun to enclose the quadrangle formed by the Arts and Industries Building on the west, the
Smithsonian Building on the north, and the Freer Gallery of Art _ on the east. A general preliminary building program and site evalu-
ation study had been prepared in 1975 and revised in 1978 in anticipation of various funding possibilities. The Regents approved a contract for the preparation of a design for a building or buildings, including a study model, to express the general design concept. In a related action, the Regents also approved installation of the James Renwick gates along the south axis of the Smithsonian Building.
The Secretary reviewed the Collections Management Study relating to the analysis of conservation needs of the museums as well as inventory controls. Methods being developed in the study will provide a model which in future years will allow for more easily maintained controls.
The Secretary reported to the Regents on various programs, including projects under way in the Smithsonian’s continuing commitment to reach out to the American people beyond Washington; plans for the observance of the centennial of the birth of Albert Einstein in 1979; the International Year of the Child and the Smithsonian’s seventh symposium in 1981 (tentatively titled ‘Biology and Culture in Human Adaptation”); reorganization and establishment of a fellowship and grant office; the status of building restoration and renovation projects; activities of the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates; establishment of a new Council at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum to help with promotion and support of museum activities; the Laserium show at the National Air and Space Museum; and the conversion in 1978 of the Institution’s measurement procedures to the metric system.

Smithsonian Institution « 1978
Summary: In reviewing the Smithsonian’s financial progress for fiscal year 1978, note should be taken of important matters which have received much attention from financial and other management personnel over this past year. These dealt with responses to recommendations generated by extensive studies of Institutional operations by the General Accounting Office, the Surveys and Investigations Staff of the House Appropriations Committee and the Smithsonian Board of Regents—essentially the result of the Institution’s increased “visibility” following years of physical and financial growth. All of these studies substantiated the integrity of Smithsonian finances. At the same time they made a number of constructive recommendations to strengthen administrative procedures as outlined in Secretary Ripley’s statements in both this year’s and last year’s annual reports. The resulting Smithsonian responses include expanded efforts to provide more extensive financial information to the Congress, the Regents, and the public.
As a part of these efforts some modifications have been made in this financial report. Whereas, it has been the practice in the past to consider federal appropriations separately from nonappropriated trust funds, the Regents, like the Congress, are now emphasizing approval of consolidated budgets which include all types of Institutional funds and clarify the relationships between them. Table 1 in this report, therefore, now sets forth the sources and application of all funds available to the Institution. Other tables in this report, for the most part, provide clarifying detail for this overall summary.

Operating Funds—Source and Application
As may be seen from Table 1 and the chart on page 34, total operating revenues of the Institution from all sources increased in fiscal year 1978 to $168.5 million, compared with $143.7 million in the preceding year. Net funds received (i.e., after expenses incurred in generating the revenues of our auxiliary activities) increased by more than $14 million to $124.9 million. These funds are of three principal kinds: federal appropriations (55 percent), grants and contracts received from federal agencies (7 percent) and nonappropriated funds from a variety of sources (38 percent), the percentages shown relating to gross revenues received. While all monies coming to the Institution are dedicated to the same broad objectives of increasing and diffusing knowledge, there are important differences in the specific uses and in the restrictions imposed on these funds. Further detail as to their uses is shown in Table 2.
Of the $14-million increase in net receipts, about two-thirds was accounted for by the $8.2-million rise in the federal appropriation to $93,393,000, equaling 75 percent of total net operating revenues. Approximately $6.3 million of this increase was required merely for the inflationary rise in salaries and utility rates. The remaining $1.9 million represented additional program support, including provision for higher equipment maintenance costs at the Zoo, expanded computer needs at the Astrophysical Observatory, a major increase for the programs of the National Anthropological Film Center, and added protection services.
Grants and contracts from federal agencies amounting to $11.2 million (8.9 percent of net operating revenues) were slightly higher than in the preceding year. These funds contribute importantly to the scientific research efforts of the Institution in areas of special capability. Again, as in preceding years (see Table 3), the Astrophysical Observatory, under numerous contracts with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, accounted for about threefourths of the total. Some examples of these projects are: research

<<<Page: 24>>>

in medical entomology and cancer in lower animals at the National Museum of Natural History, geological studies of the lunar surface at the National Air and Space Museum, studies on the molecular processes of comets at the Astrophysical Observatory, and research on the effects of radiation on plant metabolism at the Radiation Biology Laboratory.
Nonappropriated trust funds are now the second largest source of operating support. In fiscal year 1978, their gross revenues rose by 33 percent, and net revenues after costs incurred in the Smi thsonian magazine, museum shops, and other auxiliary activities which generate income, including those in some individual bureaux, increased 35 percent to $20,398,000. This amounted to 16.3 percent of total net operating revenues compared to 13.6 percent in fiscal year 1977. These included funds provided for both restricted and unrestricted purposes of the Institution.
Restricted funds income, totaling $6,538,000 in fiscal year 1978, as detailed in Table 4, was received for specific purposes designated by the donors and was derived principally from gifts ($3,478,000) and investment income ($2,022,000); also included was $1,038,000 of income from such diverse activities as the Freer Gallery shop and memberships, museum classes, and fund-raising auctions of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Archives of American Art. In fiscal year 1978 we were fortunate to receive a $1.2-million bequest from the estate of Dr. Atherton Seidell, which, as a part of the Institution’s restricted purpose endowment funds, will henceforth provide income for the publication of scientific papers. Major shares of restricted purpose endowment investment income are dedicated to the support of the Freer Gallery of Art, oceanographic research at the Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida, and other specified areas of science. Important uses of gift funds in the past year, as shown in Table 4, include: completion and opening of the Marine Hall in the National Museum of History and Technology, important additions to the mineral collection of the National Museum of Natural History, portrait acquisitions at the National Portrait Gallery, support of research fellowships at numerous bureaux, as well as a great diversity of research and education activities at all levels of Smithsonian operations.

Unrestricted purpose funds include both those for general operating purposes of the Institution and a smaller category designated as Special Purpose Funds. In the latter are included funds handled principally by individual bureaux and derived either from activities of the bureaux themselves or received from shares of income from shops and concessions. Detail on income and application of Special Purpose Funds is set forth in Table 5. As shown therein, a major portion of these funds is generated by the National Air and Space Museum; the largest portion of such revenues and expenditures relate to operation of the nasm theater and the substantial reduction in revenues this year results from its 50 percent cut in admission fees in July 1977. From this source, and a number of other aviation-related auxiliary activities, however, this bureau was able in fiscal year 1978 to transfer $250,000 to endowment funds toward a $900,000 goal of funding a Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History. NasM also supports from these funds a recently established newsletter on aeronautical subjects. Also included in these Special Purpose Funds are reserves set aside for possible additional magazine expenditures and the unspent portion

of fiscal year 1978 commitment toward a new $2.0 million per year program for Collection Acquisitions, Research, and Education, discussed below. In fiscal year 1978 an additional $2,000,000 was also reserved for partial prefunding of commitments toward new collection acquisitions. These added reserves account for the substantial rise in the year-end balance of these funds.

A far larger category of unrestricted purpose nonappropriated trust fund income is that for General Institutional Purposes, including auxiliary activities, (refer to Tables 2 and 6). Investment income applicable to these funds rose by $246,000 to $1,400,000 as the result of previous years’ income-generating transfers to endowment funds plus larger invested current fund balances. More importantly, however, net revenues from auxiliary activities rose this year by $3.2 million to equal $11,166,000. The Smithsonian Associates Program, including the Smithsonian magazine, continues to account for the major share of this income (see Tables 6 and 7). In fiscal year 1978, however, important increases in income were realized from sales of the first Smithsonian Exposition Books (The Smithsonian Experience and The Magnificent Foragers) and from a major promotion of musical records developed by the Division of Performing Arts. Income from concessions and from museum shops, including the promising new Mail Order Division, continue to provide important contributions.

creased to $4 million, including $1 million for the fourth and final contribution to the campaign to save the monuments of Nubia. The general areas of research and geographical activities of this program may be seen in Table 8.
The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange also received a $1,857,000 appropriation in fiscal year 1978, slightly lower than in the previous year. This appropriation, together with fees and contract income received from services provided by the Exchange, is normally sufficient to cover operating costs of this organization which has been operated for the benefit of the government as a Smithsonian subsidiary for a number of years. (See also page 54.)
Construction
The federal appropriation of $5,250,000 in fiscal year 1978 for construction projects was smaller than in recent years. As shown in Table 9, however, it provided for continued work on the Master Plan of the National Zoological Park in Rock Creek and for renovation at its Front Royal Conservation and Research Center. About an equal amount of money was appropriated for continued widespread restoration and renovation projects, including added improvements for handicapped visitors and employees.
An amount of $325,000 was provided for initial planning work

for an important new Museum Support Center for storage and research purposes to be located at the Silver Hill facility near Washington. Additional federal monies for completion of the planning are being provided in fiscal year 1979, and it is hoped that construction of this facility, already authorized by the Congress, can be funded in fiscal year 1980. The sum of $869,000 in nonappropriated trust funds was also provided in the past fiscal year toward construction projects. This made possible the completion of a new laboratory building at the Chesapeake Bay Center as well as its

the securities market. Income paid out under the total return policy, which was in addition to managers’ and custodial fees, was $2,303,000; this included $167,000 from accumulated capital gains. Gifts and transfers to the Endowment Funds included the transfer to Unrestricted Endowment referred to above ($3,000,000), the creation of the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History ($250,000), the restricted gift from Dr. Seidell which the Regents have voted to set aside in Endowment ($1,179,000), and other gifts and reinvestment of income pursuant to terms of gift ($230,000).
The investment management of the Consolidated Endowment Fund is conducted by professional advisory firms under the close supervision of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer, subject to the policy guidelines approved by the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents. During the year, after an extensive review by the Committee of investment performance since 1971, the services of two of these firms were terminated, and three new advisors were selected, in addition to the one retained.
A listing of the individual investments held in the Consolidated Endowment Fund as of September 30, 1978, may be obtained upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution.
Related Organizations
The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., referred to in “Other Operating Programs” above, is a separate nonprofit entity incorporated by the Smithsonian in 1971. It receives as an annual contract from the Smithsonian, the separate appropriation received from Congress for this purpose. Ongoing research information obtained by the Exchange from Government agencies and other sources is catalogued and stored in a computerized data base to permit the answering of thousands of inquiries on these subjects. In return the Exchange also receives substantial revenues from users of its services, totaling about $1,300,000 in fiscal year 1978, to cover service costs. At the request of the Congress, the Exchange will now be transferred by fiscal year 1980 to the Department of Commerce, which will thereafter assume responsibility for its program.

As mentioned in the financial report for last year, activities of the Smithsonian Research Foundation have now been terminated and incorporated in the Smithsonian’s general administrative offices.
The Institution is continuing to provide administrative services for Reading is Fundamental, Inc., an organization which now operates independently after being associated with the Institution since 1968. This organization, dedicated to improvement of reading abilities in children, has grown substantially and is now financed not only by private contributions but also by extensive federal support.
~The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, established by Congress “in the Smithsonian Institution” operates in office space and with support services provided by the Institution but is separately administered under its own Board of Trustees. During the past year the Institution assisted the Center in its launching of the new Woodrow Wilson Quarterly. The funds of the Center, administered by the Smithsonian, are included as part of “Agency Funds” like those of the organizations mentioned above.
The National Gallery of Art and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts were established legally as bureaux of the Institution to be administered, however, by separate Boards of Trustees. These organizations, therefore, present their own independent financial reports.
The Friends of the National Zoo (FoNz) is an independent, nonprofit corporation working closely with the National Zoological Park under contract with the Smithsonian. It operates a number of beneficial concessions at the Zoo, from which it contributed concession and rental fees amounting to over $115,000 during calendar year 1977 (FoNz’s fiscal year), as well as important program support for Zoo programs.

The Board of Regents Smithsonian Institution:
We have examined the balance sheet of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1978 and the related statement of changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, or other departments, bureaus and operations administered by the Institution under Federal appropriations as detailed in note 2 to the financial statements. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly the financial position of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution at September 30, 1978 and the changes in its fund balances for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION—TRUST FUNDS Notes to Financial Statements
September 30, 1978
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and General Information
a. Accrual Basis—The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution—Trust Funds have been prepared on the accrual basis, except for depreciation of plant fund assets as explained in note 1(h) below, and are in substantial conformity with generally accepted accounting principles included in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit Guide, “Audits of Colleges and Universities.”
b. Current funds include capitalized improvements and equipment use in income-producing activities having a net carrying value of $1,275,899 and $1,283,604 at September 30, 1978 and September 30, 1977, respectively. Current funds used to finance the acquisition of plant assets and for provisions for debt amortization and interest are accounted for as transfers to the plant fund.
Separate sub-fund groups of current unrestricted funds have been reflected in the statement of changes in fund balances for auxiliary activities (representing primarily the revenues and expenditures of the Smithsonian Associates Program, including the Smithsonian Magazine, and museum shop sales) and Special Purposes (representing internally segregated funds for certain designated purposes).
c. Fund Accounting—In order to ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of “fund accounting.” This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to specific purposes by action of the governing board. Externally restricted funds may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its institutional purposes.
Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and income only be utilized. Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principai but only under certain specified conditions.
While quasi-endowment funds have been established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund which owned such assets. Ordinary income derived from investments, receivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar

<<<Page: 37>>>

funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.
All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current fund. Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted resources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.
Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition when acquired by gift.
Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.
Income and expenses with respect to the Institution’s magazine and associates’ activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the applicable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current unrestricted funds.
The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide 4-42% of the five year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received.
Capitalized improvements and equipment used in income-producing activities purchased with Trust Funds are capitalized in the current unrestricted fund at cost (see note 1(b)), and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years. Depreciation expense of $181,942 for 1978 is reflected in expenditures of the current funds.
Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. Depreciation on buildings is not recorded.
All other land, buildings, fixtures and equipment (principally acquired with Federal funds), works of art, living or other specimens are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
The agency funds group consists of funds held by the Institution as custodian or fiscal agent for others.
Pension costs are funded as accrued.
The Institution has a number of contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract revenues are recognized as expenditures are incurred.
Related Activities
The Trust Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, from Federal grants and contracts and from certain business activities related to the operations of the Institution.
Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements, provide major support for the operations and administration of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s many museums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings and other assets acquired with Federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
The following Federal appropriations were received by the Institution for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1978 and 1977:

<<<Page: 38>>>

Operating funds $ 95,250,000 87,208,000 Special foreign currency

$ 104,500,000 100,219,000
The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to certain separately incorporated organizations on which certain officials of the Institution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution facilities occupied, etc., totaled approximately $409,000 for the year ended September 30, 1978. The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1978, and September 30, 1977 as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:
1978 1977
Smithsonian Research Foundation $ 120,000 2,100,000 Smithsonian Science Information
Exchange 2,355,000 3,300,000 Reading Is Fundamental, Inc. 2,260,000 1,100,000 Woodrow Wilson International
Center for Scholars 2,079,000 1,500,000
The Smithsonian Research Foundation for the year ended September 30, 1978 did not receive Federal grants and accordingly the corporate structure will be dissolved in fiscal year 1980. Also, in 1979 the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange operations are to be transferred to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Investments
Quoted market values and carrying values of investments (all marketable securities) of the funds indicated were as follows:

Substantially all of the investments of the endowment and similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units each having a market value of $110.22 ($100.24 in 1977), 341,798 units were owned by endowment, and 173,810 units by quasi-endowment at September 30, 1978.
The following tabulation summarizes the changes in the pooled investments during the year ended September 30, 1978:

$ 83,200 129,800
Pension Plan
The Institution has a contributory pension plan providing for the purchase of retirement annuity contracts for those employees meeting certain age and length of service requirements who elect to be covered under the plan. Under terms of the plan, the Institution contributes the amount necessary to bring the total contribution to 12% of the participants’ compensation subject to social security taxes and to 17% of the participants’ compensation in excess of that amount. The total pension expense for the year ended September 30, 1978 and 1977 was $1,459,325 and $1,134,312, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Institution has been recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as exempt from income taxation as an organization described in Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that section are subject to income taxation only on their unrelated business income as defined under Code Sections 512 et. seq. The Internal Revenue Service is presently considering a Request for Ruling filed by the Institution pertaining to the proper interpretation of the current regulations concerning the method of calculating certain unrelated business income. If the Institution’s interpretation is approved, no tax would be imposed on this income. It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income taxation. Recognition of the dual status will be sought by the Institution. If the Institution’s positions should not prevail, income taxes in a substantial amount could be imposed on certain unrelated business income.
