RicHarp RarusBun,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the US. National Museum.
The United States National Museum had its origin in the act of Congress of 1846 founding the Smithsonian Institution, which made the formation of a museum one of the principal functions of the latter, and provided that—
Whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to time for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may be, shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for the Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and whenever new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or otherwise, the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and arranged.
The principal and accumulated interest of the Smithsonian fund amounted at that time to about $750,000, a sum considered ample to meet the needs of the various operations in which it was proposed that the Smithsonian Institution should engage. In 1846 probably not more than one or two universities or learned establishments in America had so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of Congress that the fund was suflicient both for the erection of a building and for the care of the collections which would be turned over to it or acquired by the national surveys, and in other ways. The Museum thus began as an integral part of the Institution, coordinate with its library, and was required by law to provide for the Goyernment collections which had previously accumulated, a duty which the

Institution did not see its way clear to fulfill until 1858, when Congress began to make small yearly appropriations to aid in this purpose. So inadequate, however, were the sums voted, that for many years the slender income of the Institution continued to be drawn upon to insure the maintenance of what was then justly called the Smithsonian Museum, since the building was paid for out of the Smithson fund, a considerable portion of the collections was and still is the property of the Institution, through exploration and gift, and a number of the ofticials connected with the Museum were employed at its expense.
The first scientific collection to come into the possession of the Institution—and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest—was the small but valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist of repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.
The nucleus of the National Museum was, however, virtually acquired by the National Institute, a society organized in Washington about 1840, having for its avowed purpose the direction of the Smithson bequest and the pursuit of objects in consonance with the terms of that foundation. One of these objects was the gathering of historical and natural history specimens from both official and private sources, most prominent among the former having been the United States Exploring Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842. Rooms in the Patent Office building were secured for the museum of the society, which was practically recognized as the appropriate place of deposit for all Goyernment collections retained in Washington. Another important seryice rendered by the society was, as the late Dr. G. Brown Goode has said, in the direction of educating public opinion ‘‘to consider the establishment of such an institution worthy of the Government of the United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition at which it aimed, it became inactive upon the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, and its charter, which expired in 1861, was not renewed. The Government collections in its possession, which ‘ame practically under the care of the Commissioner of Patents, were turned over to the Smithsonian Institution in 1858. Other material directly under the control of the National Institute remained at the Patent Office until 1862, and a part of the historical objects were held there until 1883.
Previous to 1858, however, important materials for a museum were being accumulated at the Smithsonian Institution, at its own cost and through the activities of its assistant secretary, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, beginning even before his appointment to that office in 1850. The personal bent of Professor Baird was toward the collection of natural history specimens for purposes of study. With the approval of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for the accomplishment of this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield-

ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of other branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders, private explorers, and such powerful organizations as the Hudson’s Bay,Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company, were enlisted in the work and rendered valuable assistance. The influence exerted by these beginnings bas been lasting and widespread, as shown in the extensive natural history operations of subsequent National and State surveys, the organization of the Fish Commission and Bureau of Ethnology, and the support given to scientific collecting by many other bureaus of the Government.
The discussion of plans for the organization of the Smithsonian Institution, which devolved upon the first Board of Regents, led, in January, 1847, to the unanimous adoption of the following resolution expressing approval of the museum feature as one of its Important functions:
Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress establishing the Institution, and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be provided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit of any branch of knowledge. “
The policy thus announced has prevailed to the present day.
In 1879, when most of the existing Government surveys, whose work included the collecting of specimens in the field, had been established, Congress deemed it important to practically reenforce the provisions of the act founding the Institution, in order that there might be no doubt as to the proper disposition of the material certain to be derived from these various sources, by the following enactment in the sundry civil appropriation act for 1880:
All collections of rocks, minerals, soils, fossils, and objects of natural history, archeology, and ethnology, made by the Coast and Interior Survey, the Geological Survey, or by any other parties for the Government of the United States, when no longer needed for investigations in progress shall be deposited in the National Museum.
_ Although the name ‘‘ National Museum” was sometimes used in the earlier reports of the Smithsonian Institution, it did not appear in any of the laws of Congress until 1875. Its general employment may be said to date from the time of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, the first exposition in this country in which the Government participated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the people of the United States the existence of national collections at

Washington, as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting museum materials, differing radically from the older cabinets of college or local museums, which had prevailed up to that period. After its close the Government exhibits brought back to Washington, together with the extensive gifts made to the United States by private persons and foreign governments, rendered necessary the early erection of a new and separate building, devoted entirely to museum purposes. Since that time Congress has mainly provided for the maintenance of the Museum, but its management remains, by the fundamental act, under the authority of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, administered through their Secretary, who is ex officio the keeper—a form of government insuring a consistent and uniform policy and a nonpartisan administration of its affairs. The greater part of the Smithsonian building is still used for museum purposes, and the Institution, as well as most of the scientific bureaus at Washington, cooperate, both through men and material, in enlarging and caring for the national collections.
The scope of the National Museum as defined by law comprises practically all branches of science and of the arts which admit of museum treatment. With exceedingly limited means for making purchases, and therefore almost entirely dependent as to the character of its collections upon Government explorations, personal donations, and exchanges, its different departments have had a very unequal growth. The subjects best represented are American ethnology and archeology, geology, zoology, and botany. <A fair beginning has been made in the exceedingly important branches of the industrial arts and American history, and scarcely more is required to place these two departments on a proper basis than sufficient room to display the necessary collections, which are certain to be received, in greater part through gratuitous contributions, when it is known that the Museum is prepared to care for them. In the department of the fine arts the collection is still very small, but the subject is one which must sooner or later receive earnest consideration by the Government.
The specimens in all branches are classified in two series; one, comprising the bulk of the material, being arranged for the purposes of scientific research and reference in laboratories and storerooms, to which students are freely admitted: the other, selected with regard to their general educational value and public interest, and accompanied by descriptive labels, being displayed in glass-covered cases in the public halls. The duplicate specimens not required for exchanges are made up into sets for distribution to schools and colleges, as opportunity offers. Papers deseriptive of the collections, both technical and popular, are published for gratuitous circulation to the extent of three or more volumes yee ee and, finally, the Museum has come to be regarded as a bureau of information in respect to all

<<<Page: 38>>>

by (
subjects with which it is even in the remotest degree concerned, the correspondence which this involves now constituting one of its heaviest tasks.
The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Dr. Goode, may be divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows:
First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific description and theory.
Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the
‘National Cabinet of Curiosities,’ to 1876. During this period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve an educational purpose.
Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.
During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research, while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum endeavors to promote them all.
In the same connection, Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects of the Museum in the following concise manner:
It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for the reports upon the resources of the United States.
It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.
It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named series of duplicates.
In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institutions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from individuals abundant stores of great value have been received, either as gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small appropriation in recent years has permitted of some purchases to
supply desiderata.

<<<Page: 39>>>

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized as follows:
1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in connection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, and the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward the accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.
2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from 1838 to 1842, the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from 1853 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine waters.
3. The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and consular service abroad.
4, The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad surveys, the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Army; and the activities of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army stationed in remote regions.
5. The explorations of the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. 8. Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and other scientific branches of the Government.
6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several expositions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition at, Philadelphia in 1876, the international fisheries exhibitions at Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, at Omaha in 1898, and at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The returns from the World’s Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent, comprising, besides the collections displayed by the United States in illustration of the animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty of the foreign governments which participated, as well as the industrial collections of numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of Europe and America.
7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with individuals.
Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building, the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was about 235,000. In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the new building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the large

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a
aceessions received from Philadelphia, and from other sources, the number had grown to 1.471.000. At the close of 1902 it amounted to nearly 5,500,000.
While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collections, when it is considered that by 1885 all of the space in both buildings was completely filled, and in fact so overcrowded that a third building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the specimens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsate structures, where they are mainly piled up in the original packing boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great intrinsic and scientific value to fll an additional building as large as that now occupied by the main collections.
In order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete in all the groups as the accessions have made possible, 1s given to all properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The opportunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction, coming from the scientific centers of Huropean and other foreign countries, as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions having the means of providing for its safekeeping, when required in the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection with their own collections.
The custodianship of the collections being the first and most imperative duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National Museum, its members find comparatively little time during office hours for advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for such work, being selected with special reference to their ability to identify and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance with the latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff does produce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the collections, which together constitute an important contribution to scientific hterature.
Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con

<<<Page: 41>>>

duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose results the Museum shares.
Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here afforded. Under this arrangement the amount of research work carried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased. ;
Though haying little means to expend for field work, members of the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate in the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expeditions, in connection with which special researches may be carried on, though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new and valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it occurred in nature.
The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly of an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper installation of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit, the lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory development of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in this respect grow worse instead of better through the increased crowding of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in the methods of display, in the character of individual and group mountings, and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional progress has been made.
A year ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for public use were then for the first time permanently open, though none were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for workrooms.
In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of Dr. Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better understanding of the public needs. He labored earnestly and conscien

tiously to make this a museum for, as well as of, the people, and the plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of his making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and maintain the study series in a manner acceptable to the specialist, the interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his surroundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some definite impressions, some new bit of knowledge. Dr. Goode’s labors in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to the most minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official connection with nearly all the important expositions of the past quarter of a century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums of Europe and the United States: gave him exceptional opportunities for observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died, none other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy of being followed.
An incidental though very popular educational feature of the Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and colleges of its duplicate specimens, properly identitied and labeled, and put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have already been given away.
Scarcely a year passes that some expedition, either at home or abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and prominently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one another so closely and have required such extensive preparations as to interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one, insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Washington, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating the growth of museums in many quarters.
Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the publications of the Museum can be classed, in a general way, as belonging to its educational side, being the medium through which the nature and extent of its collections are made known. ‘The Annual Report, first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report in 1884, and now in its nineteenth volume, consists,. besides the administrative part, mainly of semi-popular papers on interesting portions of the collections. The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively

<<<Page: 43>>>

technical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the larger and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings twentythree complete volumes have been issued and of the Bulletins fifty-one numbers.
The National Museum now occupies the building erected for its use in 1881, the greater part of the Smithsonian building, parts of three detached buildings on the Mall, and several rented buildings south of B street SW. The floor area represented, together with the general use to which the several floors of the larger buildings and each of the smaller buildings are devoted, is shown in the following table:

An inspection of the several buildings shows conditions which are very deplorable for the National Museum of a great country. Every branch is seriously hampered by the total inadequacy of the space assigned it, and the proper disposition of specimens long ago became impossible, with the result that year after year valuable collections, often of large size, have had to be packed away in insecure rented buildings, where they are also inaccessible. While the Museum building is not ill adapted to exhibition purposes, it is much too small to serve the present needs. Its halls are overcrowded, the cases being generally placed so near together that two persons can scarcely pass between them and no effective view of their contents can be obtained, An increase in space of one-half to two-thirds at least would be necessary to properly display the present contents of these halls.
Having practically no basement, the only space available for the reserve storage, workrooms, and offices is in the small rooms of the central towers and corner pavilions, except that some of the galleries designed for exhibition have from necessity been turned over to these purposes. In these quarters the specimens are packed almost solidly, in cases generally reaching to such a height as to make access to the upper ones extremely inconvenient. The workers have scarcely room in which to place their tables, and there is little place anywhere for the spreading out of specimens for purposes of study and classification or of preparation for exhibition.
In the Smithsonian building, which was originally intended to be used only in small part for museum purposes, the conditions are similar. There are four exhibition halls, three used for zoology and one for prehistoric archeology. The latter, occupying the entire upper floor of the main building, has, through the loosening and fall of large areas of plaster from the ceiling, been pronounced unsafe and closed to the public until funds can be obtained for its repair and renovation. The large corresponding room on the ground floor has four galleries extending nearly its entire length, which, some fifteen years ago, were turned into work and storage quarters for several branches of zoology. They are overcrowded with cases and tables and are, moreover, extremely unhealthful places for the assistants stationed there because of the impure air rising from the exhibition floor below.
In the basement is stored the greater part of the valuable alcoholic collection of the Museum, in a series of dark, damp rooms, wholly

<<<Page: 45>>>

unsuited to the purpose, and where a great deal of work has to be carried on. The other workrooms and storerooms in the Smithsonian building, besides two or three small ones on the main floor, are in the north tower, which is utilized for these purposes up to the height of the seventh story. It is scarcely necessary to explain that many of these rooms, all of which are very small, are inconvenient of access, and that specimens can be carried to and from them only with difficulty.
Many of the activities of the Museum and much the greater part of its storage have, for a long period, had to be provided for in outside buildings, partly on the Mall and partly rented at an annual expense of over $4,000. The taxidermists are quartered in the upper part of the Smithsonian stable and in a temporary frame structure back of the Smithsonian building. On Armory square, adjoining the Fish Commission building, is an old, dilapidated wooden shed filled with specimens. On Ninth street SW. there is under lease a large area of land, covered with wooden sheds containing an immense amount of raluable collections and much other Museum property. The greater part of the so-called Marsh collection of vertebrate fossils, which has been valued at above $150,000, is still stored in a rented building at Tenth street and Maryland avenue, which also provides space for several preparators’ workshops. Two other rented buildings are likewise used to accommodate the extensive carpenter, paint, and glazing shops which are required for the making of furniture and for the repairs upon the main buildings. ‘
In order to carry out the purposes for which it exists, the National Museum requires a greatly increased amount of space, and that any additional space provided be better adapted to its wants than that now occupied,
For the exhibition collections a connecting series of relatively large rooms or halls is needed to permit of the arrangement of the specimens and groups of specimens, many of considerable size, in such manner as will best adapt them to the comprehension of the public and, by the avoidance of crowding, allow them to be viewed effectively.
The record collections, commonly knownas the reserve or study series, comprising the bulk of the material in most departments, while demanding such a convenient disposition as will insure the ready examination of specimens, require relatively less space than the exhibition collections, as they can be much more compactly arranged in drawers and on shelves. Yet their extent is so great that the question of their accommodation is one of the most important ones for consideration. They have been mainly derived from the Government surveys of the past sixty years, and represent a very large expenditure of publie money. :
For the activities of the Museum are needed many well-lighted and well-appointed rooms to serve as laboratories for classifying collections

and for scientific research, and as workshops for the preparation of specimens for study and for exhibition. It should also be noted that the Museum is called upon to furnish workrooms for several of the scientific bureaus, whose collections are partly studied there, and that, by a recent act of Congress, it is incumbent upon the Museum to provide facilities for such students and investigators from other parts of the country as may choose to visit it for purposes of research.
Finally, space must be provided for certain general and miscellaneous purposes, such as the mechanical workshops and storerooms, the heating plant, public-comfort rooms, the library, a lecture’ hall, the administrative offices, etc.
An, estimate of the amount of space needed has been reached by a careful consideration of the several requirements as set forth below, namely:
(1) To relieve the present very congested condition of the exhibition halls.
(2) To provide for the display of objects now in storage which are suitable and intended for public exhibition.
(3) Convenient and systematic storage for the vast reserve or record collections which are now for the most part inaccessible for examination.
(4) Suitable scientific laboratories, preparators’ workshops, ete.
(5) The mechanical workshops required in making repairs to buildings and in the construction and repair of cases and other furniture and fixtures.
(6) Offices necessary for administrative and other purposes common to all the branches of the Museum.
(7) The space required for the heating plant, the library, a lecture hall, public-comfort rooms, and other miscellaneous purposes.
(8) Provision for future growth.
The growth of the Museum fora number of years past has been mainly through the receipt of material which by law it must receive and care for. The amount of material declined or diverted elsewhere during the last ten or fifteen years because of the lack of room would have occupied a very large proportion of the present exhibition space and have greatly increased the money value of the collections. The same conditions have prevented the Museum authorities from soliciting large contributions, but with adequate facilities many extensive exhibits can be had for the asking. The department of arts and industries, the more practical side of the Museum, has perhaps suffered most from the lack of accommodations. Large exhibits have had to be removed to storage, and the growth of this most important and striking branch was necessarily stopped some time ago. It should be made here, as it has been in all the larger capitals of the world, one of the most important features of the national collections, and its

increase, once stimulated, would go forward rapidly and at relatively small expense, as generous donations might be expected from all quarters.
Using the above topics as a basis for calculations, the amount of space immediately required has been worked out in a tentative way for each of the departments. This information is summarized in the following table, which gives also for each subject the space now occupied. With regard to fae present storage areas, it should be borne in mind that raueh of the material is now Suna stored in packing boxes, and if transferred to classified storage would spread out over many times the space. The departments named are those under which the Museum is classified for convenience of administration.

Deducting this area from the total area now occupied (238,689 square feet) leaves 182,601 square feet as the amount of space now actually available and appropriate for the future needs of the Museum. Again, deducting this amount from the total space named aboye as required

<<<Page: 48>>>

for the Museum (670,000 square feet) there remain approximately 487,000 square feet to be provided for in a new building.
The facts on which the above remarks are based having been sub mitted to Congress in connection with the estimates for 1902-3, the following item was included in the sundry civil appropriation act approved June 28, 1902:
For the preparation, under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary plans for an additional fireproof, steel frame, brick and terracotta building, to cost not exceeding one million five hundred thousand dollars, for the United States National Museum, to be erected when appropriated for, on the Mall, between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, said plans when completed to be transmitted by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to Congress, five thousand dollars.
It is hoped that through this initial enactment a period of greater prosperity for the Museum is about to ensue.

The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1902, was $289,400, as against $263,540 for the previous year. The principal changes as compared with 1901 were as follows: An increase of $2,500 under furniture and fixtures, an increase of $5,500 under heating and: lighting, of which $5,000 was for completing the electric installation in the Museum building, and an increase of $360 under rent of workshops and storage quarters. The two following special appropriations were made: For the purchase and installation of new boilers in the Museum building of a capacity for heating both buildings, $12,500; for the construction of two galleries in the Museum building, $5,000.
The expenditures up to the close of the year from the appropriations for 1901-2 amounted to $274,271.20, leaving a balance of $15,128.80 to meet outstanding liabilities. During the same year $15,052.81 were disbursed from the balance of $15,293.77 of the appropriations for 1900-1901 on hand July 1, 1901.
The following tables show the expenditures during the year 1901-2 under each item of the appropriations for the past two years:

aThe total balance on June 30, 1901, was $16,715.33. No appropriations except those from which
disbursements were made during the year are mentioned in this table.
Disbursements from the appropriation for 1899-1900 were made as follows: Preservation of collections, $291.24; books, pamphlets, and periodicals, $2.55, leaving balances of 540.15 and $28.09, respectively. These balances, together with unexpended balances of the appropriations for furniture and fixtures, heating and lighting, building repairs, and rent of workshops, amounting to $12.80, have reverted to the surplus fund of the Treasury.

Several important alterations and improvements have been made in the Museum building. Some additional space has been gained through the construction of galleries in three ranges—the west-north, the northwest, and the south-west—which are being fitted up for the library and as laboratories for the departments of anthropology and geology.
The steam boilers, which had become entirely worn out after a service dating from the erection of the building, have been replaced by a pair of water-tube boilers of modern pattern, with capacity for heating both buildings. The introduction of these made it neces-

<<<Page: 52>>>

sary to overhaul the entire heating plant and to make new and more ample connections with the Smithsonian building. The boilers formerly used in the latter building will be retained in place to guard against emergencies, and the employment of one set instead of two is expected to result in the economy of both fuel and labor.
The installation of a complete system of electric-light wiring and fixtures extending to all the exhibition halls as well as to the offices, laboatories, and storerooms, begun the previous year, was finished satisfactorily. Should it be decided to open the building at night, however, an increased appropriation will be required to cover the cost of extra current and the pay of several additional attendants.
The quarters allotted to the purposes of a lunch room have been somewhat extended and improved, but this very desirable museum adjunct must always remain poorly provided for in the present building.
The sundry civil appropriation act for 1903, passed just at the close of the year, contains an item of $5,000 for the preparation of preliminary plans for an additional fireproof building for the National Museum, to cost not over $1,500,000.
The number of accessions received during the year was 1,409, containing an aggregate of 448,872 specimens, two and one-half times as many as were added in 1901, and increasing the total number of specimens in the national collections to 5,418,284, as shown by the records. This figure is, however, below the actual one, as the contents of many packages filled with very small objects are estimated at a nominal figure.
The most constant and important sources of accessions are certain bureaus of the Government whose collections are, by law, transferred to the custody of the Museum as soon as their study has been completed. Among these bureaus are the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Plants of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. Large quantities of valuable material are received from individuals and private establishments through donation and exchange, and many interesting features are added to the exhibition series through loans or deposits. Lack of funds has prevented the carrying on of field explorations by members of the Museum staff except to a very limited extent, but scarcely a year passes without some good returns through this means.
With a maximum annual appropriation of $10,000 for the purchase of specimens, not much can be done toward filling the innumerable gaps'which occur throughout the collections, though many important desiderata are thus supplied from year to year.

<<<Page: 53>>>

As a complete list of the accessions for the year is given in Appendix II, and the more important ones are described in the reports of the head curators, attention will be called in this connection to only such as are especially noteworthy.
The total number of specimens added to the Department of Anthro. pology was 40,083, prehistoric archeology heading the list with 22,197 specimens, ethnology following with 14,335 specimens, and history and biography standing third with 2,279 specimens.
Among the important contributions in ethnology were a quantity of baskets, weapons, ornaments, and parts of costumes collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, some of which have been described and illustrated by Lieut. W. E. Safford, U.S. Navy, in the Smithsonian Report for 1901; and many other objects, including crania, native clothing, lamps, and articles connected with the industries of the Eskimo, obtained in northern Greenland and Ellesmere Land by Mr. Robert Stein, of the U. 5. Geological Survey, during his Arctic expedition. A number of Guatemalan costumes and of objects illustrating the first steps in the weaving of cotton as practiced in that country, as well as other ethnological material, were received from Mrs. Mary W. Owen, of Panzos, Guatemala. Two interesting donations were a series of weapons captured during the Philippine insurrection, including several Filipino swords of the ordinary type, some bolos, and a kris, from Maj. E. L. Hawks, U. S. Volunteers; and a collection consisting principally of the different types of ‘*punal de kris,” a weapon carried by the women and children in the Philippine Islands, together with a device formerly used in the Philippine army for decapitating wounded soldiers, from Dr. W. C. Warmsley, of Norwich, Connecticut. Another Philippine collection, secured by purchase from Mr. J. N. Harkins, of Calhoun, Georgia, comprises weapons, cooking utensils, tobacco boxes, charm belts, models of boats, newspapers, statuettes, and coins.
A collection of choice objects brought together by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, and secured during the year, includes musical instruments, Japanese porcelains, domestic utensils, gambling devices, plaques, vases, an incense box, old Kutani ware, Marcusi ware, Cloisonné plates and bowls, trays, English chinaware, and ironstone china from China. Other additions to the collection of musical instruments were a small series of instruments used by the American Indians and several from European countries, including a nyckleharpa obtained by exchange from Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, of Orange, New Jersey, and 78 pieces, comprising instruments of the Javanese, Chinese, Tibetans, Japanese, and Persians; Syrian and Egyptian kettledrums, a Turkish mandolin, etc., presented by Dr. Ryan Devereaux, U.S. Army.
A complete set of the gold and silver coins of Siam, and a series of Spanish coins minted in Mexico and the Philippine Islands, embracing

the various kinds issued by Spain for use in its colonies, were obtained by purchase.
Loan collections, chiefly of historical interest, received on deposit and exhibited in the main Museum hall, were as follows: Eighty-two relics of Colonial times and a gold watch worn by George Fayette Washington, a nephew of George Washington, from the National Society of Colonial Dames; relics of the War of the Revolution, ineluding commissions in the Continental Army, from the Daughters of the American Revolution; several swords that had belonged to the late Rear-Admiral J. W. Philip, U. S. Navy, one presented by the children of Texas, another by the citizens of New York city, from Mrs. Philip; six swords belonging to Rear-Admiral R. D. Evans, U. S. Navy, including one presented by the State of Iowa and one by the crew of the battleship /owa,; and 21 guns captured at Tientsin, China, comprising the various types of European and American manufacture now employed in the Chinese army, from Col. W. H. Carter, U.S. Army. <A desk and quadrant used by Dr. C. F. Hall on his Polaris Arctic expedition, were received as a gift from Miss Anne $. Hall, of Cincinnati, Ohio
Among the important accessions in archeology were the collection of flint implements, bone utensils, and remains of extinct and recent mammals resulting from the examination of a sulphur spring at Afton, Indian Territory, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, and a very large amount of material, comprising pottery, implements of stone, wood, and shell, bones, and human remains, obtained by Dr. Walter Hough during his investigations in Arizona, partly in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates.
About 10,000 prehistoric objects from Georgia, including carvings, spearheads, polished stone hatchets, and other articles of stone, ivory, and pottery, were acquired from Dr. Roland B. Steiner. A collection of the implements used by the ancient inhabitants of the area now forming Columbia County, Pennsylvania, consisting of stone articles of domestic utility, stone hatchets, banner stones, arrow points, and spearheads, was presented by Mr. Charles Hummel, of Espey, Pennsylvania; a large series of prehistoric objects from the Potomac Valley was obtained by purchase; and material from the guano caves of Las Cruces, New Mexico, was contributed by Mr. J. R. De Mier.
Among the accessions in archeology from other countries were over 600 specimens of prehistoric vases, stone figures, carvings, and polished instruments, and figures and dishes in earthenware, from Mexico, received from Mr. E. O. Matthews; an image, mortar, and pestle of stone, from Porto Rico, presented by Mr. Henry Bird; and a series of flint implements and bones from the cavern of Kesserlock, Schaffhausen, Switzerland, donated by Prof. J. Heierli, of the University of Zurich.

The additions to the technological collections include several of historical value, such as pieces of apparatus devised and used by Dr. Elisha Gray in his experiments with harmonic multiple telegraphy and with the telephone, received from Mrs. Gray; one of the tin-foil records made by Edison’s first phonograph when exhibited before the National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, contributed by Mr. William J. Rhees; a number of electric-lighting and telephone devices, and one of the early forms of typewriting machines. a
In the Department of Biology the additions numbered 377,227 specimens, of which 324,687 were zoological and 52,540 botanical. Among the Pooleeieal divisions the greatest increase was of mollusks, namely, 173,262 specimens, followed by insects with 118,202, marine invertebrates, exclusive of mollusks, with 18,380, mammals with 6,301 specimens, ete.
The collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the East Indies, consisting principally of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, formed the most important zoological accessions. Of mammals there were 848 specimens, including many new species, from the islands of Andaman, Nicobar, Sumatra, Linga, Sinkep, Johore, and others farther eastward; of birds, over 700 apes ‘imens, and of reptiles, a considerable number. The region visited by Dr. Abbott is in large part a new field, not previously represented in ine National Museum, and the generous contributions from this indefatigable explorer give the Museum a collection from this region which is absolutely unrivaled.
Other specimens of mammals received deserving of mention were a fine skeleton of the huge Kadiak (Alaska) bear from Mr. J. H. Kidder, of Boston; African antelopes, monkeys, and birds from Dr. A. Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia; many skulls of moose, elk, and other deer from Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, of New York, and a large series of small mammals from Germany and of squirrels from Asia.
Among the ornithological material were about 300 Cuban and Porto Rican birds collected by Mr. B. 8. Bowdish; a quantity of Cuban birds collected by Mr. William Palmer; a series of East Indian birds from the Royal Museum of Natural History at Leiden, Holland; a large number of Brazilian birds from the Museu Paulista at Sao Paulo, Brazil, besides smaller collections from Mexico, Cocos Island, Hawaii, and Great Britain. Several rare species of birds’ eggs were also obtained.
The reptilian collection was enriched by the field work in Cuba and Porto Rico of Mr. B. S$. Bowdish and Mr. William Palmer, and valuable specimens were also received from Japan, Sumatra, and the Philippine Islands.
The Division of Fishes was fortunate in securing, through Messrs.

<<<Page: 56>>>

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. yA5)
Anderson and Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark (Lhinodon) 13 feet long, the first of its kind recorded as having been taken in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Leland Stanford Junior University presented the types of a large number of Japanese fishes described by Dr. David S$. Jordan, and also specimens from Panama, Cocos Island, and the Galapagos Islands. <A collection of Egyptian fishes from the Nile was contributed by Dr. Bashford Dean, of Columbia University, and interesting material from several sources was transmitted by the U. S. Fish Commission.
Twelve species of land shells from Cocos Island, cotypes of species described in E. von Marten’s work on the mollusks of that locality, were donated by Mr. William H. Dall. Some 2,000 shells from Lower California were received from Lieut. C. A. Clarke, U. 8. Navy, and a number of new species of North American land shells from Mr. J. H. Ferris, of Joliet, Illinois.
The largest addition to the Division of Insects comprised about 65,000 specimens collected in Arizona by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of the Coleoptera in the Museum, at his own expense, and by him presented to the national collections. The Museum was already indebted to this generous friend for the gift of his extensive private collection previously formed.» Some 7,000 -insects of several groups were brought from the Hawaiian Islands by Mr. W. H. Ashmead, and 10,000 specimens of lepidoptera from Colorado by Dr. H. G. Dyar, assisted by Mr. A. N. Caudell. The expeditions on which this material was secured are referred to elsewhere. Ten thousand beautifully prepared specimens of butterflies, mainly from Mexico and Yentral America, have been deposited in the Museum by Mr. William Schaus, of Twickenham, England.
The Division of Marine Invertebrates received from the U.S. Fish Commission a series of Porto Rican sponges, identified by Dr. H. Y. Wilson, of the University of North Carolina; echini and holothurians from the same locality, identified by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College; the crustaceans and echinoderms collected during the expedition of 1901 to the Hawaiian Islands; and a quantity of material from the marine station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The extensive collection of corals made some years ago at the Philippine Islands by Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C. Worcester was obtained by purchase. Among the smaller accessions of importance were a quantity of marine invertebrates from Ellesmere Land, collected by Mr. Robert Stein; a series of the cave crustaceans of Kentucky and ‘Tennessee from Prof. W. P. Hay; a number of Alaskan crustaceans from Mr. R. 5S. McGregor, of the U. S. Coast Survey steamer Pathfinder, and samples of the Atlantic sea bottom from the U. S. Navy.
Through the generous bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville, North Carolina, who died in July, 1901, the Division of Plants became

<<<Page: 57>>>

possessed of his entire collection of flowering plants, comprising more than 18,000 specimens, chiefly from the southern United States. Two years previously Dr. Mohr had presented to the Museum his collection of about 3,000 specimens of cryptogamic plants from the same region. From his trip to Central America during the summer of 1901 Dr. J. N. Rose brought back a large number of plants, including specimens from Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl, and also some living plants, which were deposited in the greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture. A valuable collection from China and the Philippine Islands was contributed by the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew, England; over 6,000 plants from various parts of the United States and from Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, and Porto Rico were transmitted by the Department of Agriculture; and about 4,200 Chinese plants were acquired by purchase.
In the Department of Geology the accessions have been numerous, and in some of its divisions of more than ordinary importance. The total number of specimens received was 31,563, nearly 90 per cent being fossil invertebrates. Among the rocks and ores transmitted by the U. S. Geological Survey were many specimens illustrative of its recent explorations in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon. <A _ large quantity of ore samples from the United States exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900 was turned over to the Museum by the Government board. The minerals added comprise many varieties, a number of which were not previously represented. Especially worthy of mention are a fine specimen of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada; a magnificent mass of moss gold on quartz from the ‘* Miner’s Dream” mine, Old Chester district, California; characteristic samples of Alaskan gold; fine specimens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Washington; axinite from Switzerland and Japan; beautiful crystals of tourmaline from Mesa Grande, California; zeolites from Golden, Colorado; anda beautiful mass of the so-called needle ore (Géthite) from Ironwood, Michigan. The following species new to the collection were also obtained: Narsarsukite, percylite, yttrocerite, picroallumogene, bornite (in crystals), espistolite, plumboferrite, ankylite, sulvanite, thalenite, elpidite, and lossenite. Fine specimens of tourmaline and amethyst were received as a gift from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, Honorary Custodian of Gems and Precious Stones.
The meteorite collection was increased during the year to the extent of 20 falls, and now comprises specimens representing a total of 356 distinct falls. The most valuable addition was a stony iron meteorite from Admire, Kansas. The sources of other important specimens were as follows: Misshof, Courland, Russia; Rafriti, Switzerland; Cereseti, Piedmont, Italy; St. Mesmin, Salles and Lancon, France; Sao Juliio de Moreira, Portugal; Limerick, Ireland; Shalka, Bengal, India; Rhine Villa, South Australia; Weston, Connecticut; Algona,

Wisconsin; Monroe, North Carolina; ‘Tombigbee, Alabama; Toneanoxie and Kiowa County, Kansas, and San Angelo and Kendall County, Texas.
In invertebrate paleontology there were several very large and important additions. Some 15,000 specimens, including 10,000 brachiopods, +,200 bryozoans, many cretaceous forms from New Jersey, and eystids and crinoids from Maryland, composing the private collection of Mr. Charles Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Stratigraphic Paleontology, were donated by him to the Museum. Prof. George M. Perdew also presented his entire collection of Silurian and Devonian fossils, about 1,300 specimens, from Cumberland, Maryland. The E. O, Ulrich collection of Ostracoda, containing about 5,000 specimens and the type and figured specimens of 100 species was acquired by purchase. The transmissions from the Geological Survey included 3,755 specimens of Cambrian brachiopods, which had been the subject of special study by the Director, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.
The extensive series of teeth of the elephant and mastodon, obtained by Mr. W. H. Holmes at Afton, Indian Territory, associated with prehistoric implements, has proved of great interest, several species being represented.
The accessions in paleobotany include a valuable collection of fossil plants, comprising the type specimens described by Prof. Ebenezer Emmons in his American Geology, part 6, 1857; 100 specimens from the auriferous gravels of California, collected by Mr. C. D. Voy; 40 specimens from what may be the Upper Jurassic formation in the vicinity of the Corwin coal mine, near Cape Lisburne, Alaska; about 300 specimens from the Miocene Lake beds of the South Fork of John Day River, in Grant County, Oregon, transmitted by the Geological Survey, and about 100 specimens of Upper Carboniferous plants from the vicinity of Plympton, Missouri, described by Mr. David White in the Fossil Flora of the Coal Measures of Missouri, and presented by Dr. John H. Britts, of Plympton.
The approximate number of specimens received by the Museum during the year and the total number in the possession of the Museum at the close of the year are recorded by subjects in the following table:

Owing to the very limited means available for field researches, the amount of work of this character carried on by assistants of the Museum has been relatively small, and most of the expeditions made were only rendered possible through cooperation with other bureaus of the Government or through the generosity of individuals. The Government explorations by which the Museum is most benefited are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution. Officers of the Army and Navy, with the exceptional opportunities now efforded them, have also been doing some excellent work for the Museum, especially in the Philippine Islands. In this connection mention should likewise be made of the important explorations which Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has been carrying on for several years in the East Indies entirely at his own expense, the results being generously donated to this Institution. The latter comprise large collections in zoology and ethnology, whose value is enhanced by the fact of their coming from a region hitherto but poorly represented in any museum in the world. The field work engaged in during the year by members of the Museum staff was as follows:
Mr. W. H. Holmes, Head Curator of Anthropology, visited Indian Territory and Missouri, in the former investigating an interesting deposit of flint implements and bone utensils associated with the remains of extinct and recent mammals at Afton and an ancient chert quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, and in the latter examining, near Kimmswick, an extensive deposit of fossil mammals in which human remains were said to occur,and an ancient village site containing stone implements and pottery. The investigations begun by Dr. Walter Hough in Arizona, in June, 1901, were continued through the summer, in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates, of Pasadena, California, and chiefly at the expense of the latter. An archeological section was made on a north and south line from Fort Apache to Moki, a distance of about 180 miles, and a large amount of material was obtained. Ethnographical work was also done among the Apache, Navaho, and Hopi Indians, and two new groups of ruins north of Holbrook were mapped.
Mr. W. H. Ashmead, who accompanied an expedition of the U.S. Fish Commission to the Hawaiian Islands in May, 1901, for the purpose of making collections of insects and of studying the insect fauna of these new possessions, returned late in the summer with an important lot of material. Mr. B. 8. Bowdish, formerly of the U.S. Army in Porto Rico, was employed for about seven months in procuring zoological specimens, chiefly birds, in Porto Rico, in eastern Cuba, and on Mona Island. Mr. C. L. Pollard and Mr. William Palmer

<<<Page: 61>>>

accompanied Dr. Edward Palmer, of the Department of Agriculture, in the spring of 1902 on an expedition to eastern Cuba, where they obtained an interesting collection of plants, birds, bats, insects, and marine invertebrates.
The station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, on the south coast of Newfoundland, was visited during the summer of 1901 by Dr. Frederick W. True, who made a special study of the sulphur-bottom whales, obtained many photographs, and arranged for the preparation and shipment to Washington of the skeleton of a large whale. Ina collecting trip to Colorado, Dr. H. G. Dyar, in company with Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, secured some 10,000 specimens of Lepidoptera, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz made in Arizona, at his own expense, a very large collection of insects. Two months during the spring of 1902 were spent in southern Illinois by Mr. Robert Ridgway in the interest of the Division of Birds. Botanical explorations were carried on in Central America during the summer of 1901 by Mr. J. N. Rose, assisted by Mr. Robert Hay, of Washington.
Important collections were made by Mr. Charles Schuchert of Helderbergian fossils in New York and of Cretaceous fossils in New Jersey. Mr. F. W. Crosby obtained for the Museum a remarkably fine series of potholes from the basalt rocks near Snake River Falls, Idaho. ,
Outfits to be used in collecting material for the National Museum have been furnished to the following persons: Mr. F. L. J. Boettcher, Washington, District of Columbia; Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. Army; Mr. H. Caracciolo, Port of Spain, Trinidad; Capt. Luther S. Kelly, Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands; Prof. O. F. Cook, U. 5. Department of Agriculture; Mr. W. W. Simpson, Shanghai, China; Mr. Arthur B. Chilson, New York City; Miss Thora Stejneger, Washington, District of Columbia; Mr. Charles S. Banks, Bacolod, Negros, Philippine Islands; Dr. 8. P. Bartlett, Quincy, Illinois; and Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. 8. Army.
Six thousand five hundred and three specimens have been sent to specialists for study, in some cases as loans, in others to be worked up for the Museum. The gifts to educational establishments and the material used in making exchanges comprised 30,893 specimens. The gifts have consisted of duplicate series of marine invertebrates and fishes, and of the collections, recently prepared, to illustrate rock weathering and soil formation.
A detailed statement of all the material sent out is contained in Appendix III. The following table shows the number of lots of specimens sent to each State and foreign country:

The material obtained through exchange with individuals abroad was as follows: From Mr. Edward Lovett, Croydon, England, a collection

<<<Page: 63>>>

of flints, reproductions of flint tools, and other interesting objects; from Rev. F. W. Galpin, Hatfield Vicarage, Harlow, England, musical instruments and a reproduction of an extinct Welsh instrument; from Mr. Réné Martin, Le Blanc, Indre, France, 25 species of Odonata from Europe, Africa, Indo-China, and other countries, and 26 species of dragon flies from Ecuador, Abyssinia, Madagascar, Tonkin, Seychelles Islands, India, Australia, Algeria, and France; from Prof. 5. E. Lassimonne, Moulins, Allier, France, 151 European plants; from Mr. C. Schirmer, Berlin, Germany, 87 species of European Diptera; from Mr. Sven Ekman, Upsala, Sweden, specimens of Polyartemia forctpata, from Mr. M. Buysman, Middleburg, Holland, three plants; from Mr. E. von Fellenberge, Bern, Switzerland, an iron meteorite from Rafriiti in the Emmenthal, Canton Bern; from M. Micheli, Romilly, Geneva, Switzerland, 100 plants from South America; from Dr. Filippo Silvestri, Bevagna, Italy, 48 species of Termites; from Prof. M. Bezzi, Sondrio, Italy, 280 species of European Diptera; from Luigi Gardinale, Vicenza, Italy, 100 species of Middle and Lower Oligocene fossils collected in the neighborhood of Vicenza; from Prof. Paul Choffat, Lisbon, Portugal, 12 specimens of Ostrea joanne from the Cretaceous system of Portugal; from Sefior Serveriano de Olea, Montevideo, Uruguay, a number of rocks and fossils; and from Mr. J. M. Macoun, Ottawa, Canada, 101 plants.
The amount of work involved in the care and preservation of the collections leaves to the members of the Museum staff comparatively little time for original investigation, though the act founding the Museum directs the classification and arrangement of the specimens placed in its custody. By consulting the Proceedings, Bulletins, and Annual Reports of the Museum, however, it will be seen that the scientific assistants do contribute extensively every year toward the advancement of science, each in the line of his special study. The working up of many groups of objects is also intrusted to scientific men not connected with the Museum, who give their services gratuitously, and many specimens are lent to aid in investigations carried on at the various scientific establishments throughout the country. Type specimens or choice objects, however, are only allowed to be taken away from the Museum in exceptional instances, and when their safety can be assured. In its present crowded condition the Museum has very scanty accommodations for visiting students, but all applicants are allowed to avail themselves of such facilities as exist.
In the Department of Anthropology the head curator continued his investigations in aboriginal art and the preparation of reports on pottery and stone implements. He also gave much time toward the completion of a paper on the Classification and Arrangement of the

<<<Page: 64>>>

Collections of an Anthropological Museum. Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology, made considerable progress in his researches on aboriginal basketry, on which subject he is preparing an important monograph. Dr. Walter Hough, Assistant Curator, was mainly occupied in working up the results of his explorations with Mr. Peter G. Gates in Arizona during the summer of 1901.
Some of the visiting specialists to the Department of Anthropology, with the objects of their inquiries, were Dr. Franz Boas, of the Amerivan Museum of Natural History, New York City, mainly the Indian tribes of the northwest coast of America; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Pueblo tribes; Lieut. W. E. Safford, U.S. Navy, for several years stationed on the island of Guam, collections of ethnology from the South Sea islands; Dr. O. F. Cook, of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, ethnobotanic material from Mexico; Dr. Washington Matthews, U. S. Army, the industries of the American Indians; Prof. W. T. Brigham, of Honolulu, the Polynesian collections; and Prof. A. C. Haddon, of Cambridge, England, ethnological material in several branches. A collection of Hopi games and ceremonial objects was lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin, director of the Free Museum of Science and Art of the University of Pennsylvania.
In all divisions of the Department of Biology a considerable amount of research work was accomplished. Mr. G. 5. Miller, jr., published five papers on mammals, based mainly on collections recently received from Dr. W. L. Abbott, several notes on nomenclature and classification, and jointly with Mr. James A. G. Rehna list of the land mammals of North America. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., completed two papers on bats and one on the Venezuelan mammals, collected by Capt. Wirt Robinson and himself, and has also studied the skeletons of American hares and pikas.
Good progress has been made by Mr. Robert Ridgway on his Manual of the Birds of North and Middle America, the first volume of which was published during the year, the second being now nearly ready for the press. The birds from the Andaman and Nicobar islands, presented by Dr. Abbott, have been reported on, and those from Linga Island identified by Dr. C. W. Richmond.
The general collection of reptiles and batrachians has been reidentified, preparatory to their rearrangement in new cases, by Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, who also continued his researches on the reptile faunas of the Antilles and Japan. Sixteen papers on the fishes of Japan, by President D. 8. Jordan and Messrs. J. O. Snyder, E.*C. Starks, and M. Sindo, were published in the Proceedings, types of the new species described being presented to the Museum. <A collection of fishes made in Japan in 1883 and 1885 for the Museum by Mr. Pierre L. Jouy was also worked up by Messrs. Jordan and Snyder. Dr. Tarleton H.

Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean completed reports on the fishes of New York for the State museum, and of Great South Bay, New York, for the New York Fish Commission, and notes by the latter on a whale shark from Florida, a steelhead salmon, and a larval conger eel were published by the Museum. Dr. Theodore Gill and Mr. Bean reported on the collection of Egyptian fishes from the Nile presented by Dr. Bashford Dean.
In the Division of Mollusks the curator, Mr. William H. Dall, has continued his work of revising and summarizing the groups of American bivalves, both Tertiary and recent. His researches during the year have comprised the preparation of a report on the newly discovered Eocene of Alaska and the revision of the family Veneride, one of the largest and most interesting of all the groups of bivalves. -Mr. Paul Bartsch has made good progress in his studies of the Pyramidellide of the Pacific coast, and Mr. Charles T. Simpson has continued his investigations on the Naiades of the world.
Mr. James E. Benedict has finished his monograph, begun some time ago, on the Crustacean family Galatheidee. The work completed or in progress by Miss M. J. Rathbun has comprised studies upon the macruran and brachyuran crustaceans of the northwest coast; a list of the decapods of the northwest coast for the report of the Harriman Alaskan Expedition; a report upon the stalked-eyed crustaceans collected in Japan by Dr. D. S. Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder; a deseription of a new species of fossil crab from the northeast coast of Brazil, for Dr. J. C. Branner’s work on the geology of that region; identifications of the brachyura and macrura collected by the U. S. Fish Commission in Hawaii, in 1901, and studies upon the fresh-water crabs belonging to the Museum of Natural History of Paris. Miss Harriet Richardson, collaborator, has completed for Prof. A. E. Verrill a report upon the Esopods of the Bermudas, and has begun studies upon the Japanese Isopods collected by the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer Albatross, Dr. Jordan and Mr. Snyder, and upon the Bopyridee in the Museum collection. She also has in press descriptions of a new freshwater Isopod from Indiana and a new terrestrial Isopod from Cuba.
Under arrangements with specialists connected with other establishments, the collections in several of the groups of aquatic invertebrates are being worked up for the National Museum, as follows: The sertularian and companularian hydroids by Prof. C. C. Nutting, of Iowa University, whose monograph on the Plumularide was recently issued as a special bulletin; the holothurians by Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, and Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College, Michigan, the former having the Pedata, the latter the Apoda; the parasitic copepod crustaceans by Prof. Charles B. Wilson, of the State Normal School, Westfield, Massachusetts, who completed during the year a monograph on the family Argulide,

<<<Page: 66>>>

which has been printed in the Proceedings; the recent corals by Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey; the crayfishes by Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia; the Pycnogonide by Prof. Leon J. Cole, of the University of Michigan; the Alpheide by Dr. H. Coutiére, of the Museum of Natural History, Paris; the leeches by Dr. J. Percy Moore, of the University of Pennsylvania, and the Ascidians from the North Pacific Ocean by Dr. William E. Ritter, of the University of California.
Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of Insects, has published during the year a large number of papers, mainly of an economic character. Mr. William H. Ashmead has continued his classification work on the Hymenoptera, has completed his classification of the Chalcid flies and has spent some time on the preparation of a monograph of the North American Braconide, begun ten years ago. He has also finished, for publication by the Washington Academy of Sciences, reports on the Rynchota of the Harriman expedition, and on the Hymenoptera of the Galapagos Islands, collected by the expedition of the Leland Stanford Junior University. Mr. Ashmead has likewise made much progress upon a catalogue of the Hymenoptera of North America and the West Indies. Mr. D. W. Coquillett has completed a synopsis of the dipterous family Chironomid. Dr. H. G. Dyar has in course of publication a bulletin entitled A Catalogue of North American Lepidoptera North of Mexico. Mr. Rolla P. Currie has been engaged in monographing the North American species of the ant-lion flies, and has begun the compilation of a cataloeue of the Neuropteroid insects of North America.
In the Division of Plants, Mr. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator, continued his investigations on the genera Sa/ir and ibes and the preparation of a work on the flora of Alaska. His publications during the year included papers on a new genus of Alaskan heather, //vrrimanella, and on two species of Pzbes. Dr. J. N. Rose was occupied in the study of Mexican plants, and engaged with Dr. N. L. Britton in preparing a revision of the Crassulaceze of North America. Mr. C. L. Pollard prepared several papers descriptive of new species of violets and of Chamecrista and a popular account of plant families. Mr. W. R. Maxon published several notes on ferns.
The collections of mammals and birds are frequently consulted by the assistants of the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. S. Army, spent the summer and early autumn in continuing his work upon the natural history of the Mexican Boundary Survey, more especially in regard to the mammals and birds. Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, examined the mammals of Mexico and Central America, and Mr. John S. McDonald, of Milwaukee, conducted studies upon the North American mammals in general.

<<<Page: 67>>>

The committee on nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union gave several days to the examination of recently described North American birds represented in the Museum. Among assistants of the Department of Agriculture who consulted the collection of birds in connection with their special researches were Mr. W. W. Cooke, Mr. E. W. Nelson, Mr. H. C. Oberholser, Mr. E. A. Preble, and Mr. Wilfred H. Osgood. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of the Ameri‘an Museum of Natural History, made studies of South American birds; Mrs. Florence M. Bailey, of Washington, District of Columbia, of Western birds; Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, of neotropical and Japanese birds, and Dr. Jonathan Dwight, jr., of New York City, on the moulting of birds.

In the Department of Geclogy important investigations regarding meteorites were carried on by the head curator and by Mr. Wirt Tassin, Assistant Curator of Mineralogy. ‘Two papers by the former relating to the Felix and Admire meteorites were published during the year, and one by Mr. Tassin on a large mass of meteoric iron from Casas Grandes has been prepared. The latter has also continued his studies on the dehydration of the ferric hydrates.
Mr. Charles Schuchert, Assistant Curator of Paleontology, has given attention to the Silurian and Lower Devonian fossils of the Appalachian region and to fossil starfishes. The monograph of the Stegosauria, by Mr. Lucas, is still in course of preparation. He has also made studies of certain features in the structure of //esperornis and Baptornis, and has examined a collection of fossil birds from the Pliocene of Oregon, submitted by Prof. J. C. Merriam.
Many specimens in the line of physical and chemical geology, requested for research work, have been supplied to assistants on the U.S. Geological Survey and to others, but the greatest amount of assistance rendered by this department has been given by the division of paleontology. Several eminent paleontologists have visited the Museum for the purpose of examining collections, and to a number of specialists material has been sent for investigation in their own laboratories. Among those who received aid in this direction were the following: Prof. H. F. Osborn, of the American Museum of Natural History, in connection with his monograph on the fossil mammalian group of Titenotheres; Dr. O. P. Hay and Mr. J. W. Gidley, of the same museum, the former having in preparation a work on the North American fossil turtles, and the latter a revision of the genus //ippotheriwm, or fossil horses; Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburg, material for comparison with fossil Dinosaurs; Dr. George

<<<Page: 70>>>

F. Eaton, of the Peabody Museum of Yale University, in his studies of Triassic fishes of the genus /schypterus; Mr. A. P. Martin, of the Maryland Geological Survey, and Dr. John M. Clarke, of the New York State Museum, in their researches on the Miocene and Devonian fossils, especially of Maryland; Prof. J. EK. Duerden, of Johns Hopkins University, on Paleozoic corals; Dr. C. KE. Beecher, of the Peabody Museum, on the fossil brachiopod genus Platystrophia; Mr. F.N. Balch, of Boston, on arctic fossil shells; Mr. and Mrs. T. 8. Oldroyd, of California, on the fossil shells of the Pacific coast. The entire collection of Middle Devonian crinoids was sent to Miss Elvira Wood, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who will classify and report upon the species. The collection of fossil plants from the Corwin coal mine at Cape Lisburne, Alaska, presented by Mr. A. G. Maddren, together with other specimens from, the same place, were turned over to Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia, for study in connection with. material recently procured from the same locality by Mr. F. C. Schrader, of the U. S. Geological Survey. Dr. Arthur Hollick, of the New York Botanical Garden, examined the collections of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary plants in connection with researches on some parts of those groups.
The crowded state of most of the exhibition halls has prevented extensive additions to the display collections except in a few directions. Much was accomplished, however, toward improving the condition and appearance of these collections by small additions and by the substitution in many instances of better material and of a higher class of preparations. Considerable progress was also made toward completing the system of labeling. It had been anticipated that provision would have to be made during the year for housing the exhibit made by the Museum at the Pan-American Exposition. A large part of the material was, however, sent to the South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, but before the close of the year the entire collection was back in Washington. The objects returned directly from Buffalo have been mainly cared for by the transfer to storage of some of the less desirable preparations previously displayed, and by utilizing temporarily a part of the lecture hall.
In the Department of Anthropology several of the halls have been thoroughly renovated and in some the collections have been reinstalled. The cases in the north-west range, devoted to the northwest coast Indians, and in the Pueblo court, have been rearranged, and many have been removed to provide space for the large family groups returned from the Pan-American Exposition. Material from the Philippine and the South Sea Islands has been installed in Kensington cases on the north gallery of the west hall.

<<<Page: 71>>>

The work of arranging the collections of prehistoric archeology according to geographical divisions has been continued, six slope-top vases having been fitted up during the year with the following exhibits: Flint implements from ancient quarry sites and workshops in middle Egypt; stone implements, spearheads, stone beads, shell ornaments and small pottery vessels from the island of Utilla, Honduras; stone beads, carved stone pendants, a copper ax, pottery spindlewhorls, ete., from Mexico; stone implements and utensils, shell implements, pottery vessels, ete., from the islands of St. Kitts, St. Bartholomew, and Nevis, West Indies; polished stone hatchets from St. Elizabeths Parish, Jamaica; polished stone hatchets, shell implements, and large pottery bowls from Jamaica. In the alcove containing the antiquities from western Asia the plaster casts have been rearranged, and casts from Persepolis and a large relief map of Palestine have been added.
Thirty-eight wing frames containing photographs supplementing the collections relating to the Jewish religion, Mohammedanism, Brahmanism, and the Greco-Roman religions have been placed on the south gallery of the west hall, and many improvements in this series have been made.
Many articles have been added to the collections of American history in the north hall, but this hall has long been overcrowded, and a number of interesting objects which belong to it are still in storage.
Extensive improvements have been made in the installation of the collections in mechanical technology, especially in the sections of land and water transportation, and many additions have been made to the collections in electricity. The type collection of small firearms of early patterns and of modern breech-loading and magazine guns has been suitably installed and labeled. The series of time-keeping apparatus, including some interesting recent additions, has been arranged in special cases in the east hall. Noteworthy among its contents are a variety of sundials, including one used by the Montagnais Indians of Canada—a pole set upright in the snow-—several rare sunglasses, a fine Persian astrolobe, a German time-indicating lamp, a water clock of the seventeenth century, and watches dating from the beginning of the fifteenth century.
Among the additions in the Department of Biology were many finely mounted specimens of American mammals and birds, a part of the display at the Pan-American Exposition, the former including a large specimen of Steller’s sea lion, an Alaskan moose, a British Columbian caribou, a musk ox, a glacier and a Kadiak bear, two wild sheep (Ovis dalli and O. stone/), and a skeleton of the Kadiak bear. Three groups of game birds were added to the series of game animals. In the southeast Museum range, allotted to reptiles, batrachians, and fishes, some improvements have been made, several new cases being

<<<Page: 72>>>

provided, many new preparations replacing older ones, and a number of large forms not previously represented being added. Among’ the latter were a cast of the King Cobra snake with accessories representing the edge of an Indian jungle, a very large Mata-mata turtle from the Amazon River, a hugh alligator snapper, the largest of the North American water turtles, several boas, lizards, toads, and frogs. An exhibit of lizards will be arranged in some of the wall cases. Amone the additions to the exhibition series of fishes was the cast of a large white, or man-eater, shark.
The permanent installation of insects in the hall recently assigned to this group at the western end of the Smithsonian building has progressed to the extent of mounting about 2,700 specimens in 20 of the standard boxes occupying several upright cases. In the labeling of this series attention has especially been called to species of peculiar habits and to those of most interest to the public.
A partial set of the colored plates of flowering plants, published in the third edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas, has been placed on exhibition in the Division of Botany.
To the display of vertebrate fossils have been added partial skeletons of the large T7ricerutops prorsus, of the carnivorous dinosaur, Allosaurus, and of the toothed bird, /lesperornis regalis. The installation of the Harris collection of invertebrate fossils, In a section of the rail-case of the gallery in the southeast court, has been practically completed. This collection, received in 188, is one of the finest yet made in the region it represents, being especially rich in crinoids, starfishes, and trilobites, containing of the last group about 600 out of the 750 species known from the Cincinnati formation.
The collections relating to physical and chemical geology have, in part, been thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and about LOO photographs, maps, and other pictures illustrative of these subjects have been placed on the adjoining walls. The building of galleries in the south-west range made it necessary to remoye for a time the collection of minerals, which at the close of the year was being reinstalled after careful renovation.
The number of visitors to the Museum building was 173,888 and to the Smithsonian building 144,107. The tables following show, respectively, the attendance during each month of the past year and for each year beginning with 1881, when the Museum building was first opened to the public.

Revolution, then in session in the city. The President-veneral and other officers of the society received in the lecture hall. As the building is a public one, no one who applied was denied admission, thoueh the attendance was chiefly made up of members of the society. The total number present was 2,087.
The meetings of the National Academy of Sciences were also held this year in the Museum building on April 15, 16,and 17. The offices of the assistant secretary were used for the business meetings of the academy and council, while the reading of papers took place in the lecture hall.
The Museum correspondence, which has always been very heavy, increases in volume from year to year. Outside of ordinary routine matters, it is occasioned for the most part by requests for information, coming from all parts of the world and relating to a wide range of subjects. Specimens, often in large lots, are transmitted for identification, and questions are submitted in regard to all branches of knowledge falling within the Museum’s scope. The requests also have reference to Museum administration, the building up and main. tenance of collections, the construction of cases, the installation, labeling, and cataloguing of specimens, and, in fact, no topic connected with a great museum or suggested by its existence escapes notice. In accordance with the time-honored custom of the Smithsonian Institution, every communication made in good faith and appropriate to be considered is fully answered, even though this necessitates incessant demands upon the members of the scientific staff, whose regular duties are quite sufficient to occupy their entire time. The number of lots of specimens determined and reported upon during the year at the request of correspondents was nearly TOO.
A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information is accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of which more than 20,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed during the year, besides the sendings to regular correspondents.
As the Museum has no facilities for making chemical analyses, requests for work of this kind have to be refused.
The most noteworthy publication of the year was the first volume of a monographic series by Mr. Robert Ridgway on the Birds of North and Middle America, which appeared in the autumn of 1901, This volume describes the species of the family Fringillidee or Finches. The families Tanagridx, Icteride, Coerebidee, and Mniotiltide, or Tanagers, Troupials, Honey-creepers, and Wood-warblers will be cov

<<<Page: 75>>>

ered by the second volume, now in press. Mr. Ridgway has given much time and care to the preparation of this important work.
Volume xxi of the Proceedings was issued in February, 1902. It contains 35 papers (numbered from 1206 to 1240, inclusive), 24 of which were written by members of the Museum staff and 11 by correspondents and collaborators. Eight of the papers relate to fishes, mainly Japanese, 7 to insects, and the remainder to fossil vertebrates, reptiles, recent and fossil mollusks, marine invertebrates, and plants. Proceedings papers 1241 to 1274, inclusive, comprising Volume xx1v, have been published in the form of separates.
A most useful work produced during the year, constituting Bulletin 51, was a list of the publications of the Museum, being a catalogue of all volumes and separate papers issued from 1875 to 1900, with an index by titles. It was prepared by Mr. R. I. Geare.
The papers comprising the general appendix to the annual report for 1900 have been issued in separate form, but the volume itself was not received from the Government Printing Office until after the close of the year. The opening article, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, is based on anthropological investigations by the author in California. — Prof. O. T. Mason describes some aboriginal American harpoons. Mr. Charles K. Wead, of the United States Patent Office, contributes an article on the history of musical scales, and Dr. Walter Hough one on Hopi ceremonial pigments. A sketch of the history of ceramic art in China, with a catalogue of the Hippisley collection of Chinese porcelains, is reprinted, with some additions, from the report of 1888. The author, Mr. Alfred E. Hippisley, commissioner of the imperial maritime customs service of China, has had on deposit in the National Museum for several years a most interesting and valuable collection of Chinese porcelains, and is well fitted to write upon this subject. A ratalogue of the collection of gems in the National Museum, by Mr. Wirt Tassin, contains descriptions of the gem minerals and their properties, comparative tables of the colors and distinguishing characters of the principal varieties, and articles on the cutting of gems, their artificial formation, supposed mystical properties, etc. A descriptive catalogue of the meteorite collection, by the same author, is designed partly to facilitate the exchange of specimens.
Part N of Bulletin No. 39, entitled Directions for Collecting and Preparing study Specimens of small Mammals, by Mr. Gerrit 5. Miller, has been reprinted in a revised edition, with abstracts in German, French, and Spanish. Directions for collectors of American Basketry, by Prof. O. T. Mason, has been added to the same bulletin asebart 2.
A circular designed to accompany a series of collections prepared by the Museum, illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, and

<<<Page: 76>>>

giving the results of the analyses of materials similar to those included in the collections, has been prepared by Dr. George P. Merrill, and published as No. 51 in the Museum series of circulars.
The distribution of Museum publications during the year to establishments and individuals in this country and abroad has amounted to about 6,500 volumes and 25,000 pamphlets.
In Appendix IV will be found a list of the publications of the Museum and of the members of its staff. The number of authors represented is 91 and the total number of papers cited 327. In the following table these papers are classed according to subjects:

Mr. Smillie was appointed chairman of the jury of awards on photography for the Pan-American Exposition, causing his absence from Washington during about a month of the summer of 1901. While serving in this capacity he made a large number of photographs of different exhibits for the Government Board of the Exposition.
Fifty-two mammals, including a specimen of Steller’s sea lion, were mounted during the year and added to the exhibition series. Eightyfive specimens in the flesh, from the National Zoological Park and other sources, were received and properly treated. Between 300 and 400 of the small skins in vats were freed from grease and made over into suitable form for permanent preservation. These included a number of type specimens. Three new groups of game birds were completed during the year, and 38 large birds and 12 smaller ones were alsomounted. Fifty-one skins were prepared from birds received in the flesh, and 112 specimens in the exhibition series were dismounted and made into skins.
One thousand and sixty-four skulls of mammals, mostly of large size, were cleaned by the Museum preparators, and more than 2,100 small skulls were cleaned by contract.

Valuable assistance has continued to be received from various departments and bureaus of the Government. Officers of the Army and Navy stationed in the Philippine Islands and in other of the new possessions have made important contributions, having in some cases been furnished with special outfits to facilitate their work of collecting. Representatives of the Department of State abroad have also been instrumental in securing interesting material. Special acknowledements are due to the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army for many courtesies in connection with the transportation of specimens and outfits to and from distant points. The relations of the Museum to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Fish Commission, the Biological Survey, and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, in regard to collections transmitted, are referred to elsewhere.
Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Navy, Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, who was stationed for some time on the island of Guam, was permitted to spend several months at the Museum during the winter of 1901-2 in classifying and labeling collections of anthropology from the South Sea Islands.
Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York,.—Vhis exposition was opened on May 1, 1901, and continued until November 1 of the same year. The large and attractive exhibit made by the National Museum has been described in the Annual Report for 1901, in a joint paper by Dr. Frederick W. True, the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum on the Government Board of Management, and Mr. William H. Holmes and Dr. George P. Merrill, head curators, respectively, of anthropology and geology.
South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Lixposition, Charleston.— In accordance with the direction of the President of the United States that the Executive Departments and bureaus of the Government participate in this exposition, which continued from December 1, 1901, until May 31, 1902, a large collection selected from the exhibit of the Museum at the Pan-American Exposition was shipped directly to Charleston, the limitations of space making it impossible to utilize the entire exhibit in that connection. Notwithstanding-the short period available for arranging this display, it presented a fine appearance and attracted much attention. A report by Dr. F. W. True on the exhibit of the National Museum at this exposition is printed as Appendix V to this report.
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missour’.—¥or this exposition, which will be held during the summer of 1904, Congress has

<<<Page: 79>>>

appropriated $450,000 toward the erection of a Government building and $800,000 for the preparation and installation of an exhibit by the several departments and bureaus of the Government. Dr. Frederick W. True, Head Curator of Biology, and with a long experience in exposition work, has been appointed to represent the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on the Government Board of Management.
The organization of the Museum comprises an administrative office and three scientific departments, as follows: Anthropology, with 8 divisions and + sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 12 sections; and Geology, with 3 divisions and 3 sections.
Besides the 3 head curators in charge of the departments, the scientific staff at the close of the year consisted of 17 curators, 12 assistant curators, 14 custodians, 11 aids, + associates, and 2 collabo‘ators, making a total of 63 persons, of whom, however, only about one-half received compensation from the Museum. Of the remainder, who are serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity, the majority were attached to other scientific bureaus of the Government.
The death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, which occurred on May 4, 1902, deprived the Museum of one of its most earnest and helpful workers. Widely distinguished for his studies and contributions on a variety of anthropological subjects, Dr. Wilson’s interests lay chiefly in the field of prehistoric archeology, and from 1889 he had charge, as curator, of the extensive and important collections of this division of the Museum.
Mr. William V. Cox, who was appointed to the Museum in 1879, and has been its chief clerk since 1886, with important duties in connection with all the recent expositions in which the Government has participated, severed his official relations with the Museum in February, 1902, greatly to the regret of his associates, to accept a more responsible position elsewhere. The duties of this office have been somewhat modified to better consolidate the administrative work, and the title of its chief officer has been changed to administrative assistant. This position was filled by the appointment of Mr. W. de C. Ravenel, previously the assistant in charge of fish culture in the U. 8. Fish Commission, who has joined to a long experience in the administrative work of that Bureau a familiarity with the preparation and installation of Government exhibits.
Mr. George B. Turner has been made chief taxidermist, and Mr. W. C. Phalen an aid in the Department of Geology. Dr. Peter Fireman, chemical geologist, resigned on September 9. t
Mr. Leonhard Stejneger, Curator of Reptiles and Batrachians, represented the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum at the Fifth

International Zoological Congress, held at Berlin, Germany, beginning on August 12. A brief account of the congress by Mr. Stejneger will be found in Appendix VI.
A list of the members of the Museum staff is given in Appendix I.
Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology in the National Museum, died on May 4, 1902. He was born in New Brighton, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, on July 18, 1832. He lived for a time in Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri, and later in Iowa, enlisting in the Second Iowa Cavalry at the beginning of the civil war. He served in the cavalry and infantry branches of the service until 1864 and was mustered out with the rank of colonel. For a number of years he was engaged in the practice of law, from which he retired in 1881 to enter the consular service of the United States. He represented this country at Ghent, Nantes, and Nice. His service as consul extended over a period of five years, after which he spent two years in traveling.
During his residence abroad Dr. Wilson devoted a great deal of attention to the study of archeology, visited many of the localities where ancient treasures were to be found, and had opportunities for meeting and working with several of the noted anthropologists of Europe. After returning to this country, he was placed in charge of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology in the U.S. National Museum, which position he held from 1889 to the time of his death. He was a member of the Société d’ Anthropologie de Paris, the Société d’Archéologie de Nantes, the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, the Order of Isabella of Spain, and the Order of Leopold; also vice-president of the Anthropological Society of Washington, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Oriental Society and of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion. Dr. Wilson was a member of the Commission to the Madrid Exposition of 1893, and of the Commission to the Brussels Exposition in 1897, and a delegate to the International Congress of Archeology in Paris in 1900.
Some of the important papers published by Dr. Wilson are as follows: The Swastika, the earliest known Symbol, and its Migrations, with Observations on the Migration of certain Industries in prehistoric Times; Prehistoric Art, or the Origin of Art as manifested in the Work of Prehistoric Man; Arrowpoints, Spearheads, and Knives of Prehistoric Times; The Golden Patera of Rennes; A Study of Prehistoric Anthropology; and Anthropology at the Paris Exposition.
Mr. Charles T. Mohr, a generous benefactor of the National Museum, was born in Esslingen, Wurtemberg, December 28, 1824, and died at

<<<Page: 81>>>

Asheville, North Carolina, July 17, 1901. Although most of his life was spent in the calling of a druggist, yet Dr. Mohr devoted much of his time to the study of plants, and it is chiefly as a botanist that he is known to the scientific world. He came to the United States in 1848, having previously traveled to South America. He stopped first in Cincinnati, but early the next year started for California. In 1857 he settled at Mobile, Alabama, where he was engaged in the drug business for many years. After making numerous smaller contributions, he finally gave his entire private herbarium, comprising some 20,000 specimens, to the Smithsonian Institution, the cryptogamic plants having come as a gift about two years before his death, and the flowering plants as a bequest. This collection has now been installed and is accessible to students of Southern plants, in which it is especially rich. Dr. Mohr was the author of various botanical papers, but his crowning work was Plant Life of Alabama, which was published posthumously. It was the one regret of his last days not to see this work finished, but he corrected all of the proofs and died only two weeks before the volume was issued. Personally Dr. Mohr was a charming and lovable man.

By Wiu1iam H. Hotes, TTead Curator.
During the year a number of changes in the personnel of the Department have taken place. Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, died on May 4, 1902, after an illness of several months. On May lt Mr. Paul Brockett was transferred from the position of clerk to the Head Curator, to the library of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr. Paul Beckwith, Aid in the Division of History and Biography, was designated to fill his place temporarily. In June, Miss Louise A. Rosenbusch, stenographer, wes transferred from the office of the curator of Prehistoric Archeology to that of the Head Curator.
The work of the year in the Department has been carried forward with all possible dispatch. The extensive exhibit shown at the PanAmerican Exposition in Buffalo has been returned and reinstalled in the Museum, constituting a very considerable addition to the exhibition series. ~The exhibit sent to Charleston was returned about the close of the year and will be placed on exhibition at an early date.
The energies of the Department have been in a great measure expended on the work of reinstalling the exhibits in halls in which galleries were built’ during the year. The occasion was taken to rearrange cases, perfect the classification, and improve the installation; and the close of the year finds the exhibition series of the department much enlarged and in every way improved. ‘The new galleries afford much additional space for laboratory purposes and for storage.
The collections received during the year are of average importance, and a number of them are enumerated in the following list:
1. Archeological collection, consisting of a large number of flint implements, utens?!s cf Sone, and the remains of extinct and recent

<<<Page: 85>>>

species of mammals (860 specimens), obtained from a sulphur spring at Afton, Indian Territory, by W. H. Holmes, Head curator.

3. Explorations in Arizona conducted jointly by Mr. Peter G. Gates and the National Museum, the latter represented by Dr. Walter Hough, yielded large collections of archeological material. One-half of the product, consisting of 701 specimens, was turned over to the Museum. These collections are to be regarded as in large part a gift to the Museum by Mr. Gates, as the expenses of the field work were defrayed by him.
1. Ethnological collections from the Kast Indies (236 specimens); presented to the Museum by Dr. W. L. Abbott.

8. Collection of Indian relics (7,837 specimens); by Dr. Roland Steiner.
The various collections received by the Department have been catalogued and cared for as in previous years. Much attention has been given to the important work of destroying insect pests, and the Department is now practically rid of them. The cataloguing is quite up to date, and considerable work has been done on the recataloguing of collections imperfectly entered in previous years.
In the laboratories much work has been accomplished. Numerous ‘asts of specimens have been made, a large number of vases have been mended, and copies and models of many objects pertaining to the Division of Technology have been constructed.
As already indicated, much progress has been made in the work of installing exhibits. Not only have the Exposition exhibits been placed, but several of the halls have been entirely reinstalled and the display made more attractive and instructive. Labeling has received especial attention and is more nearly complete than at any previous period.
Owing to the crowded condition of the Museum, a large body of material, comprising a considerable percentage of valuable specimens, has been stored in outside buildings. During the year an attempt has been made to find space for the more important storage material within the Museum building, and nothing is now sent out which has any special value or which could not readily be replaced in case of loss.
The field work of this year has not been extensive. Dr. Walter Hough continued explorations in Arizona begun during the preceding

<<<Page: 88>>>

‘REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57 year, having taken up on June 1 of the preceding year the joint exploration arranged between the Museum and Mr. P. G. Gates, who furnished the equipment. This portion of the season was spent in making an archeological section from Fort Apache to Moki, about 180 miles on a north and south line, with good results. Ethnological work was done among the White Mountain Apaches, the Navahos, and Hopi. After the close of the Museum-Gates expedition, Dr. Hough mapped two new groups of ruins north of Holbrook, returning to Washineton on September 22. During the season 60 ruins were visited and 18 excavated, many plans of ruins were made, and 3,000) specimens collected.
The Head Curator spent a few weeks in archeological exploration in the Middle West. A visit was made to Kimmswick, Missouri, where examinations were made of an extensive deposit of fossil mammals with which human remains were said to be associated, and to an ancient village site where numerous specimens of pottery and stone implements were secured. Later, collections were secured from an ancient chert quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, Indian Territory, and important explorations were made at Afton, Indian Territory. Reports had reached the Museum from Dr. R. H. Harper, of Afton, of the occurrence of flint implements in association with fossil animals ina sulphur spring near that place. The spring was cleaned out and about 800 very interesting implements were obtained, as well asa great number of remains of fossil and recent animals. It was determined that the fossil bones were connected with the original deposits through which the spring rises and that the spring had been made a place of sacrifice by the Indian tribes, and various articles had been cast in as offerings to their gods.
The Head Curator also made a short trip into Pennsylvania, examining ancient soapstone quarries near Christiana, Lancaster County, and rhyolite quarries in South Mountain, Adams County.
Dr. W. L. Abbott has continued his exploration in the East Indies, and has forwarded important ethnological collections from Java and elsewhere.
The Head Curator continued his investigations in several branches of aboriginal art, papers on pottery and stone implements being under way. Particular attention was given to the completion of a paper on the ‘* Classification and arrangement of the collections of an anthropological museum.”
Prof. O. T. Mason, Curator of the Division of Ethnology, has continued his investigations on aboriginal basketry, and has devoted much time to the preparation of an extensive work on this subject. Assistant Curator Walter Hough was engaged largely, after his return from

<<<Page: 89>>>

the field of his explorations in Arizona, in preparing a catalogue of his extensive collection, and writing his report.
Lieut. W. E. Safford, U. S. Navy, has prosecuted studies for a number of months, giving especial attention to the ethno-botany of Guam, and his paper is approaching completion.
The papers based on Museum material, published during the year by the Head Curator, Professor Mason, Dr. Hough, and Dr. Thomas Wilson, are mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix IV).

By Freperick W. TRUE, Head Curator.
The work of the fiscal year 1901-2 has been characterized by continued effort along lines already laid down rather than by new departures. The collections have grown steadily and the scientific investigation of new accessions has progressed continuously.
The zoological collections of the National Museum have grown to immense size, rivaling, other museum. Of insects there are in the Government collection nearly 1,500,000 specimens; of recent shells nearly 1,000,000 specimens; besides at least 500,000 specimens of other aquatic invertebrates, about 200,000 specimens of fishes, more than 60,000 birds’ eges,
and in some cases surpassing, those of any
130,000 specimens of birds, more than 40,000 reptiles and batrachians, and between 75,000 and 100,000 specimens of mammals, including the collection of the Biological Survey, U. 8. Department of Agriculture.
The Pan-American Exposition (opened May 1, 1901, closed November 2, 1902) continued until the end of the first third of the fiscal year covered by this report, and was followed by the South Carolina Exposition (opened December 1, 1901, closed May 381, 1902), which continued until the close of the year. At both of these expositions exhibits were made by the divisions dealing with vertebrates. A full account of the Pan-American exhibit will be found in the Annual Report for 1900-1901, pages 177-251.
The principal improvements were in the halls devoted to the exhibition of insects and reptiles and batrachians. At the close of the last year there were on exhibition 73 reptile casts and 11 batrachian casts. The number of the former has been increased to 78 and of the latter to 13. These figures do not give a just idea of the real improvement made. Three new cases were provided and many inferior casts were replaced by better ones, and several very large forms not previously represented were added. These include a king cobra snake, with accessories representing the edge of an Indian jungle; a very large

<<<Page: 91>>>

Amazon River turtle (Podocnemys); 2 mata-mata turtle, one of the most remarkable of existing animals; a huge alligator snapper, the largest of North American fresh-water turtles; several large boas and other snakes, together with various lizards, toads, and frogs. The series is far finer than ever before shown in the Museum. The space available has now been practically all taken up, except certain cases against the walls, in which it is proposed to make an exhibit of specimens of lizards in formalin of species too small to cast. The entire series shown, with but one or two exceptions, is American, and chiefly North American. The reptile faunas of the Old World can not be shown in the present restricted quarters.
An opportunity was found in April to proceed with the mounting of a new insect exhibit, for which preparations were long under way. With the aid of special assistants, the entire series o. North American beetles was mounted, and in June placed on exhibition. ‘This series occupies 20 standard exhibition boxes and comprises about 2,700 insects, representing .682 species. The collection is very carefully installed and labeled, and in the case of species having habits or peculiarities of more than ordinary interest the facts are briefly mentioned in untechnical language. Work on other orders was progressing” favorably at the close of the year.
In other classes than those mentioned the improvement of the exhibition series was less marked, though many fine mounted specimens of American mammals and birds exhibited at Buffalo were added. The portion of the Pan-American exhibit sent to the Charleston Exposition was returned just at the close of the fiscal year. The chief taxidermist, with the occasional help of one assistant, completed about 50 mammals for exhibition during the year, including one very large specimen, a Steller’s sea-lion. This spe :imen had originally been planned for the Pan-American Expositic >, but could not be exhibited for lack of space. It replaced a similiar mounted specimen which had been on exhibition over twenty-five years and had deteriorated. Mention of the principal vertebrates exhibited at Buffalo and now in the Museum will be found in my previous report (p. 63) and in the Appendix to the Museum Report for 1901 (p. 185).
The two large wall maps in the bird hall, representing the faunal areas of the globe, were repainted and lettered, so as to be more intelligible to the general public. Three new groups of American game birds were added to the series begun last year, but the work could not be continued further for lack of funds. A fine skeleton of the Kadiak bear, presented by Mr. J. H. Kidder, and a skeleton of the giant salamander of Japan, presented by Dr. C. Ishikawa, were added to the exhibition series of the division of comparative anatomy. New wall cases for the south end of the south hall were under construction during the year, but not completed.

<<<Page: 92>>>

The descriptive labels for vertebrates prepared for the Buffalo Exposition were made use of in the permanent exhibition series as far as practicable. The great series of labels of all kinds which had accumulated in the editor’s office and was transferred to the custody of the head curator some time ago, was examined by the curators of tne several divisions, and such labels as were no longer of use were picked out anc “scarded. Typewritten labels, many of them descripive, were prepared for the new exhibition series of North American Coleoptera.
As noted in last year’s report, Mr. W. H. Ashmead, Assistant Curator, Division of Insects, accompanied the U.S. Fish Commission expedition to the Hawatian Islands for the purpose of collecting insects. He left Washington in May, 1901, and returned in September, 1901, having been in the islands about three months. An expedition to Arizona for the purpose of collecting insects was undertaken by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, at his own expense. He also paid the expenses of an assistant, and very generously turned over to the Museum the large collection made. He was in the field from May to August, 1901. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, accompanied by Mr. A. N. Caudell, who was detailed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, made a very successful expedition to Colorado for collecting Lepidoptera. The work occupied about two months— from May, 1901, to July, 1901. By invitation of Dr. Edward Palmer, Messrs. C. L. Pollard and William Palmer, of the Museum, spent two months in eastern Cuba in the spring of 1902, and collected plants, birds, bats, insects, and marine invertebrates. The Head Curator visited the whaling station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company on the south coast of Newfoundland in June, 1901, and obtained much valuable information regarding the Sulphurbottom whales there taken, and many photographs. He made arrangements for obtaining a skel eton of one of these large animals at a later date. By arranement with the War Department, Mr. B.S. Bowdish, a private in the Army, was detailed to make collections of birds in Porto Rico, Mona Island and eastern Cuba. This work was carried on in (12 winter of 1901-02 and occupied about seven months. Late in the fiscal year Mr. R. Ridgway, Curator, Division of Birds, syent two months in southern Illinois in collecting birds for the iiuseum. In the summer of 1901 Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Cr .tor, Division of Plants, accompanied by Mr. Robert Hay, assistan', spent ten weeks in central Mexico in botanical explorations. He 2scended Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl, and from each mcuntain obtained a large series of plants, some of which were brovgh. living to the United States and deposited in greenhouses of the U. 8. Department of Agriculture, where they are now growing.

<<<Page: 93>>>

The largest accessions of the year were Dr. W. L. Abbott’s East Indian collections; a collection of insects from Arizona, comprising 65,000 specimens, made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz; the bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, consisting of 18,500 flowering plants, and the collections of invertebrates transmitted by the U.S. Fish Commission.
Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his zoological explorations in the East Indies during the year, making numerous interesting discoveries, and sending to the Museum great numbers of valuable specimens, especially mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. Dr. Abbott’s field of operations during the year was in the South China Sea, between Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo. Three months (January to March, 1901) he spent in exploring the Andaman and Nicobar islands, accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss. From May 26 to August 7, 1901, he visited various groups of small islands immediately east of Singapore and also the coast and rivers of Johore. In August and September, 1901, he explored the Indragiri River, Sumatra, and the neighboring islands Linga and Sinkep. Linga Island had been visited by him previously in July, 1899, on which occasion he was accompanied by Mr. C. B. Kloss.
From the Andaman and Nicobar islands Dr. Abbott sent to the Museum 278 mammals, among which were specimens of 15 new species. This collection is by far the most complete ever brought together from these islands and greatly increased the knowledge of their mammal fauna. In Sumatra and Linga and Sinkep islands 166 mammals were obtained, including representatives of 11 new species. Among the latter was a new pig related to the Borneo pig (Sus barbatus), and named Sus oc by Mr. G.S. Miller, jr. It is one of the most interesting of Dr. Abbott’s many discoveries in the Malay region, From Johore and various islands to the eastward Dr. Abbott obtained 404 mammals for the Museum. This material has not yet been thoroughly examined, but is known to be extremely valuable. The great collections of mammals of the East Indies resulting from Dr. Abbott’s extensive and long-continued explorations are unrivaled, and the mammal fauna of the region which they cover can now be studied to better advantage in the National Museum than in any other establishment.
Besides mammals, Dr. Abbott collected over 700 birds, a large series of eggs of the Nicobar Island Megapode, Jlegapodius nicabarensis, reptiles and batrachians, and numerous insects. The reptiles and batrachians are the first the Museum has received from the Nicobar and Andaman islands.
Dr. A. Donaldson Smith presented 6 African antelopes and 2 monkeys, and also 81 birds, from Somaliland, the first from that region which the Museum has received.

<<<Page: 94>>>

Among the important specimens received from the Fish Comuinission were the types of the fishes Mistichthys luzonens/s, of the Phil ippine Islands, and /ilophias tanner’, together with the sponges collected in Porto Rico in 1899, and identified by Dr. H. V. Wilson, and the holothurians and echini from the same locality, identified by Prof. H. L. Clark. Added to these were the crustaceans and echinoderms collected by the Commission in the Hawaiian Islands in 1901: about 1,500 specimens of common species of invertebrates from Woods Hole, Massachusetts, intended to be made up into sets for distribution to educational institutions; about 1,300 shells and 2,750 packages of miscellaneous invertebrates of other classes which had accumulated in the laboratories of the Commission; and seven lots of crayfishes from Maine, The Commission also transmitted a collection of about 800 plants made by Messrs. Evermann and Clark in Indiana.
The Museum having agreed to publish a series of papers by President D. S. Jordan, the Leland Stanford Junior University presented a collection of Japanese fishes, including the types of species described by Dr. Jordan. Collections of fishes from Panama and Cocos and Galapagos Islands, and of crustaceans from the Hopkins-Stanford Galapagos Expedition of 1898-99 were also presented.
The Museum purchased from Prof. Bashford Dean some excellently preserved reptiles and invertebrates from Negros Island, Philippine Islands, and Professor Dean presented a collection of fishes from the Nile River.
A collection of about 300 birds, including many species of importance, was obtained for the Museum by Mr. B.S. Bowdish in Cuba and Porto Rico (see Explorations, p. 61). Mr. Bowdish also obtained several exceedingly rare reptiles, and one new species from these islands, and collected reptiles in Mona Island, from which the Museum had not previously received specimens. Other collections of Cuban reptiles and birds were obtained by Mr. William Palmer during a two months’ sojourn at the eastern end of the island.
Mammals. —A remarkably fine skeleton of an adult Kadiak (Alaska) bear was presented by Mr. J. H. Kidder. The skeleton conveys an even more vivid impression of the strength of this huge beast than the mounted skin recently added to the collection. Mr. Harry Pidgeon presented an excellent series of skins of the wild sheep of the northern Rocky Mountains, Ov/s stone7. The Museum was fortunate in obtaining numerous additions to its collection of bats during the year, amounting in all to about 260 specimens, of which 35 were from the Philippine Islands; 58 specimens were the gift of Mr. Charles E. Ashcroft, jr., U. S. Weather Observer at Rosean, Dominica Island, West Indies.
Dr. EK. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, having received word of the stranding of asmall whale near Newport, Rhode Island, notified the Museum

<<<Page: 95>>>

of the occurrence, and a preparator was detailed to obtain the skeleton. . Through the good offices of Capt. James Sodermann the specimen was held for the Museum. It proved to be the ziphioid, or bottlenose, whale, Ziphius cavirostris. The specimen was adult, and the skeleton is remarkably fine.
The Museum obtained by purchase about 275 specimens of obscure and little-known Species of small mammals from Germany; 104 mammals of Ecuador, including an undescribed species of native cat, named Felis wquatorialis, by Dr. E. A. Mearns, and 60 Asiatic squirrels especially needed for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collection. Fourteen moose skulls, 8 elk skulls, and 12 skulls of other deer were obtained at a nominal price from Mr. E. Thompson Seton.
Birds.—A valuable series of East Indian birds, 281 in number, which are of special use for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collection, was obtained from the Royal Museum of Natural History, Leiden, in exchange. <A series of 161 Brazilian birds was obtained by exchange with the Paulista Museum, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Mr. Anastasio Alfaro presented 12 birds from Cocos Island, a Jocality seldom visited. This sending includes several specimens of the rare sparrow Cocornis agassiZt. Mr. R. D. Lusk presented a specimen of the thick-billed parrot, Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha, obtained in Arizona. This parrot had not been taken previously within the limits of the United States. Mr. H. W. Henshaw presented 14 rare Hawaiian birds, and Mr. A. Boucard added 16 humming birds in continuation of his earlier donations in 1895 and 1896. Mr. J. H. Riley gaye the Museum a collection of 286 birds of Maryland and Virginia for use in exchanges.
The Museum purchased a select collection of 105 much-needed Mexi‘an. birds.
Birds eggs.—The great collection of birds’ eggs received several important accessions during the year, besides those presented by Dr. Abbott and already mentioned (p. 62). Dr. Ralph added to his numerous donations of previous years a collection containing several sets of egos of the rare Everglade Kite, Rostrhamus sociabilis. A series of egos from Texas, including those of Vireo atricapillus, was given by Mr. H. P. Attwater. A collection presented by Mr. J. P. Babbitt contained eggs of Larus schistasagus, a species of which the Museum lacked specimens.
The Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture transmitted a number of sets of eggs from different parts of the United States, including two sets of eggs of the Tennessee warbler, of which the Museum had no representative previously. A small collection of rare egos from Arizona was purchased.
Reptiles and batrachians.—An excellent skeleton of the Giant Salamander of Japan was presented by Dr, C, Ishikawa.

<<<Page: 96>>>

Mr. Robert T. Matthews presented two very rare snakes from Nicaragua, and Rev. Cyrus A. Clark an equally rare Japanese species, with some other specimens. The skeleton of a large leather-back turtle was donated by Mr. W. E. West. This was a very welcome accession, as the skeleton in the exhibition series of the Museum was not perfect. The Museum made a number of purchases of reptiles during the year, of which the most important were 50 specimens from Sumatra and vicinity for comparison with Dr. Abbott’s collections, and 137 especially well-preserved specimens from Costa Rica to strengthen the Museum collections from that country, which, though extensive, are not in the best condition. The material obtained from the Philip pine Islands and from Porto Rico has already been referred to (see p62).
Fishes.—Besides the collections obtained from the U.S. Fish Commission, Stanford University, and Professor Dean, already mentioned, the Museum secured through the good offices of Messrs. Anderson and Price, of Ormond, Florida, the skin of a whale shark, RA/nodon, about 13 feet long, the first ever taken in the North Atlantic.
Mollusks.—The principal donations in this class were 2,000 shells from Lower California, presented by Lieut. C. A. Clark, U. S. Navy; 35 specimens of new and rare species of land shells from various localities in the United States, presented by J. A. Ferris; a collection containing specimens of 12 species of land shells from Cocos Island, representing cotypes of species described in Van Marten’s work on the shells of the island. These were obtained by Mr. William H. Dall.
Insects. —The number of insects added to the collection during the year, including deposits, exceeded 100,000 specimens, or nearly three times as many as were received during the previous year. Included among the accessions were four large collections, the principal of which was that made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, Custodian of Coleoptera, assisted by Mr. H. 8. Barber. This collection, which Mr. Schwarz made at his personal expense and presented to the Museum, contained 65,000 insects. Mr. W. H. Ashmead collected about 7,000 insects in the Hawaiian Islands. Dr. H. G. Dyar, Custodian of Lepidoptera, assisted by Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, collected 10,000 Lepidoptera and Orthoptera in Colorado. This collection comprised a large number of blown lepidopterous larvee prepared in the field by Mr. Caudell. The fourth large accession was a deposit made by Mr. William Schaus, consisting of about 10,000 beautifully prepared specimens of butterflies, chiefly from Mexico and Central America.
Besides these four large accessions there were 306 smaller ones, all of which are referred to in Appendix II. Only a few can be mentioned in this place. Prof. T. D. A, Cockerell presented various

<<<Page: 97>>>

collections of insects from New Mexico, containing many types and cotypes. Mr. D. W. Coquillett, Custodian of Diptera, presented a valuable collection comprising 2,214 specimens of American Diptera. Two accessions of insects of the Philippine Islands were received from Dr. Paul L. Stang], and one from Maj. M. L. Robb. Mr. W. P. Hay presented 500 Mexican Lepidoptera. A> collection of Homoptera was presented by Prof. Elmer D. Ball, including types of many species described by him. Types and cotypes of new species were also presented by Prof. KE. B. Williamson, Prof. H. Bird, Prof. Ralph Y. Chamberlin, and Mr. H. H. Newcomb. The deposit of these types is a matter of great satisfaction to the Museum, and much to the interest of entomologists.
At the close of the year arrangements were entered into for the purchase of 4,000 finely prepared Costa Rican insects, in which the Museum collections are deficient. This was the only purchase during the year. Several excellent collections were procured by exchange, the principal of which were 744 European Diptera from Prof. M. Bezzi, and a series of exotic Termitidee, including many types, obtained from Dr. Felippo Silvestri.
Marine invertebrates.— Besides the collections from the U.S, Fish Commission and Stanford University, already referred to (p. 63), mention should be made of the crustaceans from caves in Kentucky and Tennessee, including types of two blind species, which were presented by Mr. W. P. Hay; crustaceans from Alaska, presented by Mr. R. C. McGregor, of the U.S. Coast Survey steamer Pathfinder; samples of Atlantic Ocean bottom, from the Bureau of Equipment, U.S. Navy, and a collection of miscellaneous marine invertebrates from Ellesmere Land, presented by Mr. Robert Stein.
One large purchase was made during the year, consisting of 96 boxes of corals collected by Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean C. Worcester in the Philippine Islands. This collection contained a great variety of valuable study material.
Plants.—The accession lots added to the herbarium for the year were 342 in number. In 1899-1900 Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville, North Carolina, presented to the Smithsonian Institution his collection of cryptogamic plants, comprising about 3,000 specimens, and at the same time bequeathed to the Institution his extensive herbarium of flowering plants. Dr. Mohr died July 17, 1901, and on August 23, 1901, the flowering plants, comprising about 18,500 specimens, were received from his executors. This valuable bequest is of much importance to the National Herbarium, as it consists chiefly of plants of the Southern States, which were not well represented previously. Dr. J. N. Rose, Assistant Curator, collected about 3,000 plants in Mexico, chiefly on Mount Orizaba and Mount Popocatepetl. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, presented 748 plants from Rhode Island. A

<<<Page: 98>>>

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. O7 collection of 681 plants, chiefly from the Philippine Islands, was received as a donation from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Eneland.
A large amount of valuable material, comprising more than 6,000 specimens, was transmitted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the year. The more important collections are as follows: From Porto Rico, collected by Messrs. Cook, Underwood, and Griges (1, 100 specimens); from Guatemala and Mexico, collected by Messrs. Cook and Griges (1,000 specimens); from Brazil, collected by José de Campos Novaes (511 specimens); from Idaho and Wyoming, collected by EK. D. Merrill and C. V. Wilcox (804 specimens); from Alaska, Oregon, Washington, and California, collected by F. A. Walpole (711 specimens). The U. 5. Geological Survey transmitted a collection of 485 specimens, collected in Arizona by Mr. John B. Leiberg, and the U.S. Fish Commission a collection of 314 specimens, collected by Professors Evermann and Clark in Indiana.
Several important exchanges were effected during the year. Mention may be made here of the following: 747 Porto Rican plants and 444 Mexican plants from the New York Botanic Garden; 554 Colorado plants from Mr. Frank Tweedy.
During the year the Museum made purchases of plants to the amount of $1,000 and about 10,100 specimens were obtained. The largest collections were 4,249 specimens from China and 1,000 specimens from Mexico. The remaining purchases consisted chiefly of plants from various parts of the United States, as follows: Colorado, 1,383; Utah, 455; California, 450; Gulf States, 445; Georgia, 558; Florida, 523.
In the Division of Mammals a considerable amount of time was spent in making uniform, complete labels to replace earlier ones, many of which had deteriorated from long use or the infiltration of oily matter from the skins. The rearrangement of the small mammals was practically completed last year as far as space would permit. On account of the cramped quarters it has been necessary to store many trays of less frequently used material in boxes, a very undesirable plan. During the year covered by this report five new cases were made for the large mammals, and they are now all reasonably well protected from dust and insects, but are still much overcrowded, so that they are to a certain extent inaccessible and can not be properly arranged. The large skins in vats are still uncleaned and in danger of destruction. no money having been available for their renovation. Of the small skins, between 300 and 400 were freed from grease and made over into‘a suitable form for permanent preservation. Among these were included many type specimens. The rooms for mammals in alcohol were improved by the addition of several hundred feet of shelving,

<<<Page: 99>>>

but as this was not put in place until near the close of the year little was done toward rearrangement. The specimens themselves are in good condition. During the year 1,064 mammal skulls, mostly of large size, were cleaned by the Museum preparators, of which 590 belonged to the collection of the Biological Survey, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and 474 to the regular collections. In addition, 2,167 small skulls were cleaned by contract. This work is of special importance, as in the study of mammals cranial characters are largely depended upon for the discrimination of species. The additions to the collections of the Biological Survey were catalogued in the Museum as hitherto, and 13 new storsge cases were constructed for their reception. At the request of Dr. D. G. Elliot, of the Field Columbian Museum, the skulls of a considerable number of types and rare species were photographed for his work on the mammals of Mexico and Central America.
In the Division of Birds the conditions existing last year continued with little change. The curator being occupied the greater part of the time in preparing manuscript for the press, the routine work fell almost altogether on the assistant curator, who was without assistance except for a few weeks. During this period some progress was made toward completing the rearrangement of the birds in the new cases provided last year. The assistant curator took charge of the repacking of exhibits at the Buffalo Exposition and installing them at the Charleston Exposition.
In the Division of Reptiles a beginning was made in rearranging the study collections on the new shelving provided last year, but as this work involves a large amount of re-identification of species it necessarily proceeds slowly. The collections are in a good state of preservation.
Little more can be accomplished in the Division of Fishes by the present small force than to keep the collections from deteriorating, and to enter and care for new accessions and to attend to the scientific correspondence. ‘Toward the close of the year, however, the work of preparing 100 sets of duplicate specimens for distribution to educational institutions was begun, and good progress made. The assistant curator went to Charleston in January to install the collection of fishes in formalin which was transferred from the Buffalo Exposition.
A large number of standard drawers was added to the equipment of the Division of Insects, and the re-arrangement of the collections thereby much facilitated. The Lepidoptera have now all been well arranged by Dr. Dyar in the standard drawers. Mr. Schwarz has been engaged in similar work on the Coleoptera and completed 50 drawers during the year. The Ichneumonidea and Chalcidoidea were arranged by Mr. Ashmead. Mr. Currie has worked continuously on the Neuroptera and by his effo:ts the collection of Odonata has been

<<<Page: 100>>>

greatly increased and improved. Work on the Diptera was continued by Mr. Coquillett, and at present the collection of insects of that order is probably at least as good as any other similar collection in the country. The Diptera are still in old style boxes. Inall other orders, except the Rhynchota, the collections are in good condition, though less work has been done on them. The Rhynchota is a laree order of great economic importance and should have the care of a properly qualified specialist.
The accessions to the Division of Marine Invertebrates were for the most part cared for as soon as received, but the large collection of Philippine corals purchased from Professor Steere was not all unpacked for want of room. With the present force the specimens can not be catalogued as fast as identified, but a large amount was accomplished during the year.
It has been fully recognized that the collections of the Division of Plants, also known as the National Herbarium, are not housed as satisfactorily as could be desired, while the offices and laboratories are cramped almost beyond sufferance, and it has been necessary to resort to many ingenious devices to accommodate the working force.
When the Herbarium was transferred from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the National Museum, the old cases in which it had been kept were also brought over and when set up were remodeled and improved as far as possible. It was obvious, however, that they could not be made tight enough to absolutely exclude dust and insects without a greater expenditure of money than would be justified. About three years ago a new form of case was devised, and at the beginning of the present fiscal year 104 of these new cases were in use. During the past year 40 additional cases were constructed, making 144 in all. It is estimated that about 200 additional cases will still be required to replace the old ones. Congress was asked to supply funds for these much-needed cases, and it is hoped that the amount appropriated for mechanical work will enable the Museum to construct the greater part of them, if not all, during the coming year.
Mr. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator, reports as follows regarding the cataloguing of specimens:
At the time the herbarium was actually transferred to the National Museum, in 1894, we began to stamp and record the accessions. It was assumed that there were then about 200,000 sheets in the herbarium, and the stamp was set at 200,001.
The number of specimens catalogued during the past eight years is 202,945. Of these 15,975 were added last year.
The work of recording the old part of the herbarium has almost ceased and specimens are only stamped when they are to be sent away asa loan. This record runs from 1 to 26346. In addition to this, specimens have been stamped with numbers from 125000 to 156409.
The Division of Plants has been rather more favorably situated as regards funds than any other division of the Museum. Since its trans

<<<Page: 101>>>

fer from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1894 it has expended
pach year, as agreed upon, the sum of $10,000, a larger amount than
allotted to any other division. In the present quarters, however, it Gan not hope for the facilities which a less crowded building would afford.
On the other hand, it is to be stated that the division has not main-
tained an extensive exhibition series, as has been the case with nearly
all other divisions of the Museum.
Plans of the new cases adopted for the Division of Plants were sent by request to Mr. F. D. Gardner of the Porto Rico Agricultural Experiment Station, and to Mr. KE. L. Morris, director of biology, Washington high schools.
The supply of catalogue books for the several divisions having been exhausted, the opportunity was taken to revise the: headings, which had been in use with but little modification for about fifty years. After full consideration it was found impracticable to make the catalogues conform to those of the other two departments of the Museum, but by introducing two columns without headings a form was devised which can be used by all the divisions of the Department of Biology, except the Division of Plants. The size of the books was not changed.
As already said in another place, much of the work done during the year covered by this report was continuation of work begun last year or earlier. The first voiume of the large manual by Mr. Rk. Ridgway, entitled Birds of North and Middle America, which was mentioned last year, was published on October 24, 1901. The second volume is nearly ready to issue, and the third volume is well under way and will probably go to press sometime during the coming year. Mr. Ridgway has had little time for other duties than reading proof and completing manuscript on this work.
Dr. C. W. Richmond prepared a report on the large collection of birds from the Andaman and Nicobar islands presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and identified the collections from Linga Island, Sumatra.
Much of the time of Dr. Stejneger was occupied in re-identifying the general.collections of reptiles and batrachians preparatory to their re-arrangement in the new cases already mentioned. Although this work affords nothing for publication, it amounts to a revision of many genera. The investigations of the reptile faunas of the Antilles and of Japan, mentioned in last year’s report, were continued. The monograph on the reptiles and batrachians of Porto Rico was not completed as expected, owing to the receipt of new material from Mona Island
-which required description and illustration. In the course of his

<<<Page: 102>>>

studies in Europe Dr. Stejneger encountered important collections which necessitated a partial revision of his manuscript.
Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., published five papers based on the mammal collections during the year, the principal ones containing descriptions of Dr. Abbott’s collections from the Nicobar and Andaman islands and Indragiri River, Sumatra. In both numerous new species were described. Mr. Miller also published several nomenclatural and classificatory notes, and jointly with Mr. James A. G. Rehn, of Philadelpha, a very carefully prepared list of mammals of North America, entitled Systematic results of the study of North American land mammals to the close of the year 1900. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., published two papers on bats and one on the Venezuelan mammals collected by Capt. Wirt Robinson and himself. He has been engaged in the study of the skeletons of American hares and pikas.
The Museum published during the year a series of papers by President D. S. Jordan, and Messrs. J. O. Snyder, E. C. Starks, and M. Sindo, on the fishes of Japan. These papers covered 16 groups, such as the eels, cardinal fishes, surf fishes, anglers, etc. The types of new species were deposited in the National Museum. President Jordan also published conjointly with Mr. J. O. Snyder a list of the fishes collected for the Museum by the late Pierre L. Jouy in Japan in 1883 and 1885. Dr. Tarleton H. Bean and Mr. B. A. Bean completed reports on the fishes of New York for the State Museum and of Great South Bay, New York, for the New York Fish Commission. Notes on the whale-shark received by the Museum from Ormond, Florida, on a steelhead salmon, and on a larval conger eel were also published by Mr. B. A. Bean. A report on the fishes of the Nile River presented by Prof. Bashford Dean was prepared by Dr. Theodore Gill and Mr. Bean.
The conchological work accomplished during the vear is summed up by Mr. W. I. Dall, Honorary Curator, as follows:
The curator has continued his work of revising and summarizing the groups of American bivalves. The revision of the fossil species (Tertiary), those of the general collection (recent), and of the American recent species all proceed together, so that for the most part concluding the work on a group means that the specimens in the collection belonging to that group have been brought up to date. The work which has chiefly occupied the curator during the past year has been (1) the preparation of a report now finished, but not yet printed, on the newly discovered Eocene of Alaska, and (2) the revision of the family Veneridie, one of the largest and most interesting of all the groups of bivalves, including 137 American species not inciuding those of southern South America. The work on the recent species, including the description of 22 new ones discovered during the research, is completed, but the tossil forms will require further study as comprising many undescribed species.
Mr. Barisch, under the supervision of the curator, has continued his researches in the Pyramidellidee of the Pacific coast, a wholly unexpected influx of undescribed forms having come to light by search in the sand and gravel reserved for the scrutiny of the student of Foraminifera. The nomenclature being in a bad state, a large

<<<Page: 103>>>

amount of research has been necessary, and this has occupied the time not taken up by the multifarious duties in the division which the absence of an efficient clerk makes it necessary to call upon Mr. Bartsch to perform.
Mr. Simpson has been continuing his work on the Naiades of the world, which has made reasonable progress, but has called for little in the way of publication during the year.
A very large number of identifications and lists of species for correspondents was made during the year, as usual, but this work, though taking much time and more or less directly beneficial to the Museum, calls for no extended remarks.
Prof. Charles B. Wilson, who has volunteered to work up the collections of parasitic copepod Crustacea belonging to the Museum, completed a monograph of the family Argulide. The monograph of the Crustacea of the family Galatheidee by Dr. J. E. Benedict, mentioned in last year’s report, was completed, but has not yet been published. Miss M. J. Rathbun completed a study of the macruran Crustacea of the northwest coast of America, and prepared preliminary descriptions of both Macrura and Brachyura, which were published in the Proceedings of the Museum. Shealso prepared a list of decapods of the Northwest, with descriptions of new and rare forms, for insertion in one of the volumes of the report of the Harriman Alaska expedition, now in press. The collection of stalk-eyed Crustacea made by Dr. D. S. Jordan and Mr. J. O. Snyder in Japan was also reported on by Miss Rathbun. In addition she described a new species of fossil crab for Branner’s Geology of the Northeast Coast of Brazil, identified the Brachyura and Macrura collected by the U. S. Fish Commission in the Hawaiian Islands, 1901, and renewed work on the fresh-water crabs belonging to the collections of the Paris Museum, publishing in that connection a description of a new species of Parathelphusa. Prof. W. P. Hay described two blind crustaceans from Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, and Nickajack Cave, Tennessee. Miss Harriet Richardson, collaborator, continued studies on the isopods. She prepared, at the request of Prof. A. E. Verrill, a report on the isopods of the Bermudas, and began reports on the Japanese isopods. She also took up the study of the general collection of Bopyride, and prepared descriptions of two new isopods from Indiana and Cuba, respectively.
Dr. L. O. Howard, Honorary Curator of the Division of Insects, who is also Entomologist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, published during the year a large number of papers having for the most part an economic bearing. <A list of these will be found in the bibliography accompanying this report. In addition Dr. Howard published a large popular work entitled The Insect Book, treating of North American insects exclusive of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. The scientific work of other members of the staff of the Division of Insects for the year is thus summarized:
Mr. Ashmead still continues his classificatory work on the Hymenoptera and has published much on the subject. He has just finished his classification of the

<<<Page: 104>>>

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ie
chaleid-flies of the superfamily Chalcidoidea, a complex fully as large as the Ichneumonoidea. The material in this superfamily in the national collection is most valuable and has been arranged by Mr. Ashmead according to his classification. He also continues his work on a monograph of the North American Braconidie begun ten years ago, and has every reason to believe that his manuscript will be ready for publication in the Proceedings of the Museum this fall. He has also finished and handed in for publication in the Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences his reports on (1) the Rynchota of the Harriman expedition, and (2) the Hymenoptera of the Galapagos Islands, collected by the Leland Stanford Junior University expedition. Mr. Ashmead has also done much work upon a catalogue of the Hymenoptera of North America and the West Indies. A complete bibliographical catalogue of our species has never been published, and it is believed that such a work will be found useful and valuable. Difficulty has been found in placing some of the species described from Mexico and Central America, and before these can be assigned to their proper genera it will be necessary to examine the types in the British Museum.
Mr. Coquillett has completed a synopsis of the dipterous family Chironomid.
Dr. Dyar has completed and handed in for publication in the Proceedings a catalogue of the North American Lepidoptera north of Mexico.
Mr. Currie has been engaged when other work would permit in monographing the North American species of the antlion flies, family Myrmeleonidie. He has begun the compilation of a catalogue of the neuropteroid insects of North America.
Mr. F. A. Lucas completed a paper on latiloid fishes.
The scientific work of the botanists has covered a wide field. My. F. V. Coville, Honorary Curator of the Division of Plants, continued his studies upon the genera Sa//x and Ribes, and is also preparing a flora of Alaska. He published during the year a paper on a new genus of heather, //arr/manella, of which specimens were obtained by the Harriman Alaska expedition, and a paper on two species of L/hes. Dr. J. N. Rose continued work on the Mexican flora, and engaged with Dr. N. L. Britton in preparing a revision of the Crassulaces of North America. Mr. C. L. Pollard published papers describing new species of violets and of Chamecrista, also a popular account of plant families and on the formation of the Florida Keys. Mr. W. R. Maxon published various notes on ferns.
The Museum has always enjoyed the cooperation of specialists in different branches of systematic zoology and botany in classifying the collections and identifying species in groups with which the members of the scientific staff are not familiar. These transactions are of a varied nature. Sometimes the use of all the Museum specimens of a group are solicited by a specialist engaged in preparing a monograph, to enable him to base his conclusions on greater masses of material than he personally has at his disposition. In cases of this kind the Museum benefits chiefly by having the specimens in its collection identified. In other instances the Museum asks the assistance of an expert in working up a collection, both to get the specimens identified and to

<<<Page: 105>>>

obtain a paper for publication in the Proceedings, or Bulletin. In still other instances both the above-mentioned objects are aimed at, the expert getting the use of material for use with other collections in a work of general scope, and the Museum receiving a report on its own specimens.
The system has worked to the advantage of the Museum and also, it is believed, has facilitated in no small degree the work of zoological and botanical specialists, both in the United States and abroad. Many collections were in the hands of specialists at the beginning of the year covered by this report and others were sent out during the year. The most important were as follows: A series of 208 Patagonian mammals sent to Dr. J. A. Allen, American Museum of Natural History, for use in Connection with his work on the Mammals of the Princeton expedition to Patagonia; 68 Alaska squirrels, also sent to Dr. Allen; 49 mammals sent to Dr. D. G. Elliot, Field Columbian Museum, for use in connection with his work on the mammals of Mexico and Central America; 68 martens sent to Mr. 8. N. Rhoads, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, for use ina study of the genus Justela; 315 fishes from Negros Island, Philippines, to Dr. D. 5. Jordan, to be identified for the benefit of the Museum; the general collection of Salpz and simple ascidians to Dr. William E. Ritter, University of California, to be identified for the benefit of the Museum; the general collection of Pyenogonida (which had previously been in the hands of Dr. Meinert, of Copenhagen) and other specimens, to Prof. Leon J. Cole, University of Michigan, to be worked up for the benefit of the Museum; 14 lots of Porto Rican echinoderms to Prof. H. L. Clark, Olivet College, to be identified at the request of the U. S. Fish Commission; 64 lots of Alpheide to Dr. H. Coutiere, Paris Museum, added to the collections of the same kind previously sent him, to be classified for the benefit of the Museum; 11 lots of leeches to Dr. J. Perey Moore, University of Pennsylvania, added to similar lots previously sent him and identified for the Museum. The following insects, with many smaller lots, were lent for study: One hundred specimens of the genus Leucania to Prof. J. B. Smith, Rutgers College; 118 specimens of Ophionini to Dr. E. P. Felt; 188 Lepidoptera to Dr. W. J. Holland, Carnegie Museum; about 400 specimens, illustrating the natural history of the dragon-flies and their allies, to Prof. James G. Needham, Lake Forest University, for monographie work; 332 Tettigide to Dr. J. L. Hancock.
Loans of plants were 30 in number, among which the following deserve notice: 214 specimens of Amorpha and Philadelphus to the Biltmore Herbarium; 197 specimens of /gudsetum to Mr. A. A. Eaton; 589 specimens of Cardamine to Dr. A. Engler, Royal Botanical Museum, Berlin; 100 Hepaticee to Dr. A. W: Evans, Yale University; 474 specimens of Nyctaginacee to Dr. A. Heimerl, Vienna; 223 mis

<<<Page: 106>>>

cellaneous plants to the New York Botanical Garden; 574 Alew to Mr. W. A. Setchell; 140 specimens of Hucalyptis to the Botanical Garden, Sydney, New South Wales.
The shells of the family Achatinellide which were in the possession of the late Prof. Alpheus Hyatt at the time of his death were trans ferred to Prof. A. G. Mayer, of Brooklyn, who is engaged in completing Professor Hyatt’s unfinished work.
In addition to the use made of the collections by the specialists to whom specimens were sent, various investigators and students work in the laboratories every year for longer or shorter periods. A ereat deal of such work is done by the scientific staff of the various bureaus of the U. 8S. Department of Agriculture which are concerned in zoological and botanical researches and by the officers of the U.S, Fish Commission. Dr. kb. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, spent the summer and early autumn of 1901 in work on the natural history of the Mexican boundary. Dr. D. G. Elliot, Field Columbian Museum, spent a few weeks in January and February, 1902, in examining Mexican and Central American mammals.. Mr. Outram Bangs, Museum of Comparative Zoology, spent some time in studying South American and Japanese birds. Mr. Frank M. Chapman, American Museum of Natural History, examined the collections of South American, and especially Peruvian, birds. Mrs. Florence M. Bailey made some investigations on the bird collections preparatory to the publication of a work on the birds of western North America.
Prof. W. P. Hay continued the work on the crayfishes mentioned last year, and rendered valuable assistance to the Museum by identifying recent additions to the collections. Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan continued work on the general collections of corals, as opportunities occurred.
Numerous specialists and students examined various portions of the collections of insects.
Dr. N. L. Britton, director of the New York Botanical Garden, was a frequent visitor to the Herbarium during the year, especially in connection with his studies on the Crassulacew and Cyperacex. The collection representing the genus Plantago was studied by Mr. KE. LL. Morris, director of biology in the high schools of Washington City. Dr. P. A. Rydberg examined the Rocky Mountain plants, Dr. Charles F. Millspaugh the plants of Yucatan, Dr. L. M. Underwood the fern collection, and Mrs. E. G. Britton the mosses. Prof. EK. L. Greene, of the Catholic University of America, was a frequent visitor to the Herbarium, and Mr. J. B. Leiberg devoted much time during the

<<<Page: 107>>>

winter in identifying a western collection of his own and one obtained by Prof. L. F. Ward in Arizona.
Several students whose purpose was to familiarize themselves with different groups of animals have had desks assigned to them for longer or shorter periods. Such students are always weleome, but in the present cramped condition of the building they work under ereat disadvantages both as regards space and light.
The distribution of so-called ‘* duplicate” specimens to educational institutions continued as far as circumstances would permit. The preparation of these sets consumes much time, and with the limited force only a moderate number can be got together in any one year. The sets of marine invertebrates mentioned in last year’s report were distributed to 71 institutions, chiefly colleges, normal schools, and high schools. In May work was begun on the preparation of a new series of 100 sets of fishes.
The Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York, closed November 2, 1902, and certain members of the staff were detailed to repack the exhibits of the Department. This work was under the supervision of Dr. Charles W. Richmond. ‘The President having signified his desire that such portion of the Government exhibit at Buffalo as could be accommodated should be transferred to the Charleston Exposition, a selection of objects was made, packed separately, and shipped direct to that city. The remainder of the Buffalo exhibit was returned to Washington and installed in the permanent exhibition cases. The Charleston Exposition closed May 31, 1902, and just prior to that date several members of the scientific staff were detailed to repack the objects exhibited there.
The Head Curator was appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum on the U. S. Government Board for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904.
Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., returned to the service of the Department, September 1, 1901.
Mr. George B. Turner was appointed chief taxidermist, September 21, 1901.
Miss A. R. Knapp was appointed on April 1, 1902, to a clerical position in the Division of Plants.

By Grorar P. Merriny, Head Curator.
The year that has passed, though characterized by no single event of great importance, has, nevertheless, been one of steady progress along lines essential to good administration. More has probably been accomplished in the way of systematizing and completing the records of the collections than in any single year in the history of the Department. Changes of importance in the personnel have occurred, involying the resignation of Dr. Peter Fireman, on the 9th of September; the furloughing of Mr. John W. Coleman, preparator in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology; the appointment of Mr. R. S. Bassler, preparator in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, and the appointment of Mr. W. C. Phalen as aid in the Division of Geology. The resignations and furloughs, it should be stated, were voluntary, Dr. Fireman retiring to accept a more lucrative position elsewhere, and Mr. Coleman accepting temporary employment in Mexico on account of the condition of his health. Temporary services have been rendered by Miss Moody and Miss Vouté,
The total number of accessions received by the various divisions of the Department is shown in tabular form below.
For purposes of comparison those for the years 1809-1900 and 1900-1901 are also given.

From this it might appear that there has been a steady falling off in the amount of material received. The discrepancy is, however, largely apparent. With the gradual increase in the size and degree of completeness of the collections we are enabled to exercise more and more

<<<Page: 109>>>

discrimination as the years go on, and material that would at one time have been acceptable is now rejected. No idea of the value of the accessions, moreover, can be derived from these figures, and it is safe to say that in at least two of the divisions the materials are of a value equal to that of any corresponding period in the history of the Museum.
It is well to note in this connection that as time passes a proportionally smaller amount of desirable material comes to the Department in the way of gifts, while the funds that can be devoted to purchase and collecting remain far too small. As a natural consequence the growth of the collection is likely in time to be seriously checked.
The most important of the accessions noted above have been:
1. A collection of 173 specimens of ores and 6 transparencies of mining regions received from the Government exhibit at Paris in 1900.
2. A fine example of native tellurium from Delamar, Nevada, gift of B. F. Swindler.

7. A beautiful mass of the so-called needle ore (Géthite) from Ironwood, Michigan, the gift of the Cleveland Cliff Iron Company.
8. A collection of rocks from Ellesmere Land, gift of Robert Stein.
9%. Three fine specimens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Washington; two fine specimens of axinite from Switzerland and Japan.
10. Two beautifully perfect crystals of tourmaline (rubelite) from Mesa Grande, California.

These bring the number of distinct falls represented in the collection up to 356.
15. The EK. O. Ulrich collection of invertebrate fossils (in part), comprising some 10,000 specimens, representing not less than 1,250 species, of which some LS0 are types.
16. Three thousand seven hundred and fifty-five specimens of Cambrian Brachiopods, representing Dr. C. D. Walcott’s Cambrian studies, a a him transferred to the Museum. |
. One thousand three hundred specimens of Silurian and Devonian nae from Cumberland, Maryland, the gift of Prof. George M. Perdew.
18. Some 15,000 invertebrate fossils, including 10,000 Brachiopods, 4,200 Bryozoa, several hundred Cretaceous fossils from New Jersey,

<<<Page: 111>>>

and Cystids and Crinoids from Maryland, the gift of Mr. Charles Schuchert, the Assistant Curator of the Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology. This is an important series and formed a part of Mr. Schuchert’s private collection at the time he became connected with Me cape
Teeth of Hlephas columbi and Elephas imperator, obtained at on Indian Territory, by Mr. W. H. Holmes.
20, Sixty-eight specimens of fossil plants from the Triassic of North Carolina, received from Mr. H. F. Cleland, of Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, a valuable collection representing the type specimens of Prof. Ebenezer Emmons and described by him in his American Geology, Part 6, 1857.
21. One hundred specimens of fossil plants collected from the auriferous gravel of California, by Mr. C. D. Voy, prior to 1878.
22, Forty specimens of fossil plants from the vicinity of Corwin Coal Mine, near Cape Lisbourne, in Artic Alaska, the gift of Mr. A. G. Maddren, of Seattle, Washington.
23. About 300 specimens of fossil plants from the Miocene lake beds of the South Fork of John Day River in Grant County, Oregon. Collected by Messrs. F. H. Knowlton and John C. Merriam, and ‘received from the U. 8. Geological Survey.
24. About 100 specimens of Upper Carboniferous fossil plants from the vicinity of Clinton, Henry County, Missouri, the gift of Dr. J. H. Britts, of Clinton, Missouri. The collection includes a number of types described by Dr. David White in the Fossil Flora of the Coal Measures of Missouri.
The sources of the new material are in part indicated above. As in years past the U. S. Geological Survey has been the principal contributor, though several valuable specimens have been obtained by purchase and exchange, as noted.
Mr. F. W. Crosby collected for the Museum a remarkably fine series of pot holes in basalt, found in the vicinity of Snake River Falls, Idaho.
The meteorite collection and the collection of minerals have been enriched mainly through exchanges and purchase. As noted, Dr. L. T. Chamberlain has made an important addition to the gem collection.
Mr. Schuchert, during his vacation, made important additions to the collections in the way of Helderbergian and Cretaceous materials from New York and New Jersey. Mr. Bassler, while at the PanAmerican Exposition, devoted a few days to collecting Bryozoa in the Devonian and Silurian rocks of the vicinity.
In all the divisions of the Department there were received upward of 4,100 specimens requiring entering and numbering, and in many

<<<Page: 112>>>

cases the preparation of cards for card catalogues and, perhaps, labels for exhibition purposes as well. In addition, considerable progress was made in working over the old materials.
Much time, as before, is occupied in identifying material received from other institutions or from individuals, and for which the Museum receives no adequate return. Some 297 of these temporary accessions have received attention during the year.
Mrs. Jouy, who has been placed in charge of the records of the Department, reports the following entries in the catalogue books: Division of Geology and Sections of Paleobotany and Vertebrate Paleontology, 1,759; Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, 2,102; Division of Mineralogy, 129. Three thousand one hundred and fiftyseven catalogue cards have been prepared, also manuscript for 558 labels for the Government Printer. Some 30,000 numbers have been painted upon specimens by Mr. Cruikshank and the Misses Vouté and Moody.
Several of the collections, including the concretions and cave and glacial deposits, in the Division of Geology, have been thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and over 500 specimens re-installed in new exhibition jars. Some one hundred photographs, maps, and other illustrations have been distributed among the exhibition series. The details of this work, as in years past, have been looked after by Mr. Newhall. The mineralogical hall was disarranged in January, owing to the erection of the new galleries, and is now in process of restoration. The work can scarcely be finished during the present. fiscal year.
Mr. Schuchert reports that altogether he has put away in final museum form during the year some 21,000 specimens. ‘Twenty-five boxes of old material have been withdrawn from storage and the material worked into the Museum collections. The installation of the Harris collection has been completed.
Mr. Lucas, who still remains in charge of the vertebrate fossils, reports the mounting of the hind legs and pelvis of 7r/ceratops prorsus and similar parts of the carnivorous dinosaur A//osaurus.
The time of Dr. Peale has been fully taken up in attending to the routine of his department, and no progress whatever has been made on the exhibition series. The study material, which has received his chief attention, is rapidly becoming systematized and put in first-class condition. F .
A systematic effort has been made toward preparing the type and illustrated specimens in all the sections and divisions of the Departinent. This has taken a considerable amount of time on the part of the heads of the various divisions, the clerical work remaining largely in the hands of Mrs. Jouy and Miss Graves. The manuscript for nearly 6,000 type and illustrated specimens has thus been prepared.
a catalogue of
NAT mMuS 1902 6

<<<Page: 113>>>

It was hoped that this catalogue might be completed in season to hand in with my annual report.
In accordance with the plan originated several years ago, a small series of rocks, illustrating the various stages of rock decomposition and formation of soils, was prepared for distribution to schools and colleges. Ninety-one sets were prepared, comprising eleven specimens each. These were accompanied by a descriptive pamphlet of three pages, giving localities and analyses.
As the years go on, and particularly as the halls grow more and more crowded, there accumulates a large amount of duplicate and less desirable material, which has been stored away in boxes or wherever available space can be found. This is especially the case with the Division of Geology proper, where the character of the material is such that it often comes to the Museum in bulk to be trimmed up and prepared for exhibition on the ground. During the past year a systematic effort has been made to sort this and dispose, to the advantage of the Museum, of such as was not actually needed for study or exhibition. Nearly 2,500 specimens and upward of 4,500 pounds of rocks and ores in the rough have been thus disposed of, the returns coming in the form of meteorites and minerals in which a maximum value is represented by a minimum amount of material.
The regular routine of the Museum has been somewhat disturbed this year, as in years past, by exposition work. Messrs. Newhall, Stewart, and Bassler were at Buffalo for a period of eighteen days in November, engaged in packing the exhibit of the department, which had been there throughout the exposition, and in January following Messrs. Schuchert and Stewart went to Charleston to install the exhibit there. In May, Messrs. Stewart and Newhall and the Head Curator visited Charleston for the purpose of packing the collections for their return to Washington. I may note here that the collections forming the exhibit at Buffalo and Charleston have been all returned, those from Charleston arriving too late to receive attention during the present fiscal year. Mr. Bassler was engaged during July, August, and a part of September, at Newport, Kentucky, in packing the Ulrich collection, noted elsewhere.
The condition of most of the collections of the Department is fairly satisfactory. We are, of course, badly hampered for space, and a large amount of material is needed to render many of the collections complete or systematic. The final installation, in the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology, of the Harris collection, received in 1898, is practically accomplished. The exhibition portion now comprises some 8,400 specimens mounted on 365 tiles and blocks and occupying 50 running feet of the gallery rail case in the southeast court.

<<<Page: 114>>>

This collection, which has been briefly referred to in previous reports, is the result of nearly fifty years of work on the part of Mr. Harris, and is generally accepted as being the finest collection of its kind extant. It is particularly rich in Crinoids, of which, in the form of slabs and free specimens, there are not less than 1,500 specimens. It is also extremely rich in Silurian starfishes and Trilobites, containing some 600 out of the 750 known species of this crustacean so far described from the Cincinnati formation. The Museum, as well as the country at large, is to be congratulated on the fact that so valuable a collection has become permanently housed where it will be accessible to all workers. Much credit is due Mr. Schuchert for the efficient manner in which he has handled this and, indeed, all the collections that come under his care.
It may be well to remark in this connection that the skeleton of FHlesperornis regalis, obtained a year ago for the Pan-American Exposition, has been returned in safety and now constitutes one of the most interesting exhibits in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology.
The collections in the mineral hall are not yet fully restored from the confused condition into which they were thrown in January by the erection of galleries, as already noted.
Work of research in the Division of Geology has been greatly curtailed through the resignation in September of Dr. Peter Fireman, chemist of the Department, as before noted. What investigations have been carried on have been limited mainly to meteorites. As will be seen by reference to the bibliography, two papers relating to the Felix and Admire meteorites have been prepared and published during the last year by the Head Curator, the chemical work having been done in part by Dr. Fireman and in part by Mr. Tassin, the Assistant Curator in the Division of Mineralogy. This investigation has yielded what is believed to be important contributions to our knowledge of these interesting bodies, the Felix stone having been shown to be a tuff containing minerals of undoubted secondary origin, and that of Admire showing the iron under such conditions as to suggest its origin through reduction of a chloride or sulphide.
Mr. Tassin has himself studied and prepared for publication a paper on the large mass of meteoric iron from Casas Grandes, Mexico, and has continued his studies on the dehydration of the ferric hydrates. He hopes to be able to publish the result of this latter work during the next calendar year.
Mr. Schuchert has continued his study of the Silurian and Lower Devonian of the Appalachian region, and has in preparation monographs of these fossils from the Maryland region, to be published in the main by the Maryland Geological Survey. He has also continued

<<<Page: 115>>>

his work on the monograph of the fossil starfishes. A monograph on the fossil Ostracoda is in contemplation.
Mr. Lueas is still engaged on the monograph of the Stegosauria mentioned in my last report, and has also devoted some time to the study of certain points in the structure of Hesperornis and Baptornis. He has also studied a series of birds from the Pliocene of Oregon submitted by Prof. J. C. Merriam.
The usual custom of lending material for study has been followed, as in previous years. Material from the divisions of Geology and Mineralogy has thus been lent to the U.S. Geological Survey and vertebrate material to Messrs. Osborn, Gidley, and Hay, of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and to Mr. J. B; Hatcher, of the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburg. Material from the Section of Invertebrate Paleontology has been lent to Dr. John M. Clarke, of Albany; Dr. C. E. Beecher, of New Haven; Mr. J. E. Duerden, of Johns Hopkins University, and Miss Elvira Wood, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The U.S. Geological Survey, as usual, has had free access to the materials whenever occasion demanded.
The generalized section across the entire American continent, which was referred to in my last annual report, remains as yet unfinished, owing to lack of funds. The collection which was to accompany the same is also incomplete and remains in an old wall case entirely unsuited for this use, but which, it is hoped, may shortly be replaced.
It is expected that the skeleton remains of the Triceratops or Claosaurus will be mounted for exhibition during the coming year and, possibly, also, that of the Mastodon obtained at Church, Michigan, in the summer of 1901.
Further development Pes lines other than those already established is rendered practically impossible, owing to lack of space.
It is extremely desirable, if not essential to the welfare of the Museum, that the Department should be allowed to have an annual allowance for field and collecting expenses. No museum can rely wholly upon gifts for its advancement. Collections coming by this means are invariably lacking in certain essential materials which can be only in part supplied by purchase. More than that, the scientific force can not, I believe, be kept up to the desired point of efficiency if they are obliged to remain at their desks throughout the summer months. I am strongly in favor of sending men into the field whenever it is possible. At present there are at least three regions capable of furnishing desirable fossil invertebrates, which it is very essential we should investigate at once, besides numerous localities for vertebrate fossils, minerals, and general geological materials,

The use of the earwig’s forceps is found to | be the unfolding of the wings of the insect |
before flight, not the closing of them on alighting, in the Staphylinid beetles. Winged insects with complete metamorphosis are held to be more primitive, and the analogy of Dyscritina as a larval earwig with Projapyx as the larva of Japyx is pointed out. The cockroaches are less primitive than the May flies, Odonata, and other insects with aquatic larve, and the derivation of the wings of insects from larval gills seems prob-

This is the first part of a general treatise on the birds of America north of the Panama Railroad, but including the Galapagos Islands. It embraces the family Fringillide, or Finches, of which 391 species are here recognized as coming within the limits of the work. Each species is fully described, its geographical distribution is given in detail, and an ample synonymy is appended. Twenty plates, representing the characters of the 69 genera treated, accompany the volume. The first 37 pages of the work deal with the classification of birds, with keys to the family of Oscines, or songbirds, and to the genera of Fringillide as represented within the geographical limits stated above. Carpodacus mexicanus sonoriensis (p. 185), Saltator magnoides medianus (p. 664), and Geospiza harterti (p. 507) are described as new.

The male fig tree, in the seeds of which the Blastophaga develops, has only two crops each year. The Blastophaga proved to have four annual generations at Fresno, of which one develops in the spring and threein the fallcrop. A part of the last generation hibernates, but the winter generation is in no way distinet from those insects that hatch late in the fall. The influence of climate on the development of the Blastophaga is very great, for at Niles, Cal., only two generations were observed in the year 1900.

In this paper 3 new species Whittleseya desiderata White, Whittleseya brevifolia White, and Whittleseya dawsoniana White—are described and illustrated, and their source and age discussed. The conclusion reached as to the age of the beds is that they are referable to the upper part of the Pottsville. The relations and systematic position of the species are also considered. They are found to be more closely allied to the group of broader proportions, in general characteristic of the Upper Pottsville, than to the linear group which prevails in the lower portions of the Pottsville of the Appalachian province. tematically they are regarded by the author as referable to the Ginkgoales, the Whittlesey, in the judgment of the writer, being the oldest representatives of the Ginkgoales stock yet discovered.

REporRT ON THE EXHIBIT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AT THE Souri Carouina, INTERSTATE AND West InprAn Exposrrion, CHARLEsTON, 1901-2
By Freperick W. TRU,
Head Curator, Department of Biology, in charge. ’ I ) DY; g
The South Carolina, Interstate and West Indian Exposition, held at Charleston, South Carolina, opened December 1, 1901, and closed May 31, 1902. The object of this exposition, as shown in its prospectus, was ‘*‘ commerce in the South; to open up new foreign markets, particularly in the West Indies; to begin the twentieth century of the Christian era with an exhibition of the arts of peace; to develop the American culture of silk and tea; to promote the Southern manufactures of cotton and iron; to establish new steamship lines from Charleston, the central seaport of the great Southeast; to show the world the resources and attractions of the territory along the Southern seaboard and the advantages of Charleston as a connecting link between the producers of the Southeastern States and the Mississippi Valley on one side and the markets of the world on the other.”
In the sundry civil bill making provision for the expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, an item was inserted for a Government exhibit at Charleston. This item was subsequently rejected, and as the Exposition would open before the matter could again be brought to the attention of Congress the director-general appealed to the President to order an exhibit sent to Charleston with the understanding that the exposition company would meet all expenses.
The President was favorably inclined toward this request, and by his direction the Secretaries of the Executive Departments instructed the proper officials to select from the exhibits made at the Buffalo Exposition, and send to Charleston, such objects as would be appropriate for display in the latter place. The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution also received a request from the director-general that some part of the exhibits of the Institution and National Museum at the Buffalo Exposition be sent to Charleston at the expense of the exposition company, which request, after due consideration of all the circumstances, was granted.
In his first message to Congress President Roosevelt mentioned the matter of a Government exhibit at Charleston, as follows:
“The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of Congress. I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the Charleston Exposition have requested the Cabinet officers to place thereat the Government exhibits which have been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken the responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. In my opinion the management should not be required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the Congress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose.”’
The space allotted to the Government exhibits was in the semicircular colonnades connecting the large central building known as the Cotton Palace with two other buildings—the Palace of Commerce and the South Carolina Building. These colonnades were originally designed to be open on the sides, but in order to properly house the Government collections they were enclosed and furnished with windows and skylights. A very good exhibition space was thus obtained at a moderate
to inaugurate new industries and

expense. The portion of this space assigned to the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum was on the west side of the grounds, between the Cotton Palace and the Palace of Commerce. Including a small building called an ‘‘exhedra,”’ it comprised 5,682 square feet. The whole of the curved arcade, comprising 4,727 feet, was occupied by the Museum.
After consultation with the officers of the Institution and Museum, a number of objects in the Buffalo exhibit which were too large for the space at Charleston, or were otherwise unsuitable, were ordered sent to Washington, and the remainder, comprising about two-thirds of the original exhibit, were packed separately and forwarded to South Carolina. A number of preparators and mechanics were detailed from Washington to install the exhibit. This work was completed January 15, 1902, at which time the doors were thrown open to the public.
As the collections displayed by the Museum at Charleston were the same as those shown at Buffalo, it is unnecessary to enumerate them here. A full description will be found in the Report for 1901 (pp. 177-231).
The principal omissions at Charleston were the larger mammals, a part of the birds, reptiles, and fishes, the larger ethnological groups and the models of aboriginal dwellings, the skeleton of Hesperornis, the collection of native elements, ete.
The largest object exhibited was the skeleton of the huge extinct reptile, T'riceratops. This stood in a central position, and, on account of the excellent lighting, showed to even better advantage than at Buffalo. Around it were grouped the other geological exhibits, occupying eight cases and comprising minerals, cave deposits, and invertebrate fossils. On the two sides of the central space were the exhibits of the departments of Anthropology and Biology.
The principal exhibit of the Department of Anthropology consisted of six large groups, in separate cases, representing native American peoples. These were supplemented by collections representing the products of different arts of the native Americans, such as basketry and pottery, and native hunting and fishing implements, firemaking devices, etc. The group cases were placed against the west wall in a single row, and opposite them were the smaller cases, nine in number, arranged so as to form alcoves.
The exhibit of the Department of Biology, which was at the opposite end of the space, had as its principal feature a case 40 feet long, containing mammals. This was placed against the west wall, and opposite and at the extreme end of the space were the smaller cases, arranged like those of the Department of Anthropology, in the form of alcoves, and containing characteristic American fishes, reptiles, batrachians, and birds.
The collection remained on exhibition until May 31, 1902, when the exposition closed. At this time preparators were again sent from the Museum to repack the collections, which work was completed June 16, 1902.
On January 21, 1902, Congress appropriated $90,000 to reimburse the exposition company for expenditures made in behalf of the Government exhibit. This appropriation was not disbursed under the direction of a Government board or of the individual representatives of the several departments and bureaus, but by the Treasury Department directly to the exposition company. This arrangement worked somewhat disadvantageously, in so far as the Government exhibits were concerned, as it was necessary for the exposition company to actually pay out money from its own funds before reimbursement could be made by the Treasury. On June 12, 1902, tlie affairs of the exposition company passed into the hands of a receiver, and no payments could be made until the court acted in the matter. As the president of the exposition company declined to continue paying Government expenses from his private purse, and the court was unable to pass upon the case at once, a considerable time elapsed during which no bills were settled. It is to be hoped that in similar cases in the future provision will be made for disbursement under the direction of a Government board.

Report oF DELEGATE TO THE Firru INTERNATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL ConGREss, BERLIN, AuGuST 12-16, 1901.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY, Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
Dear Str: I have the honor to submit herewith a brief account of my visit to the Fifth International Zoological Congress at Berlin, to which, on July 15, 1901, you appointed me a delegate to represent the Smithsonian Institution and the United States National Museum.
The congress was opened on August 12 and lasted until August 16, when the delegates and members adjourned to attend the reception given in their honor by the High Senate of Hamburg. The 17th was spent in Hamburg inspecting the zoological collections there, and on August 18 and 19 most of the members visited the Marine Biological Station on Heligoland. Having urgent business at the Hamburg Naturhistorisches Museum, I remained there instead of going to Heligoland.
The congress was in every respect a success. Not only was the attendance (about 750 members) greater than at any previous congress, but the standard of the scientific papers and discussions was unexcelled. I need only refer to the lectures by Prof. G. B. Grassi (Rome) on the malaria problem from a zoological standpoint, Prof. Yves Delage (Paris) on the theories of fecundation, Professor Biitschli (Heidelberg) on vitalismus and mechanismus, and Professor Branco (Berlin) on fossil remains of man.
One of the main factors of this suecess was the unexampled interest in the congress displayed by the German Government. A large sum of money was placed at the disposition of the local committee by the Government, and the German Crown Prince, as the high protector of the congress, was only prevented from opening the congress in person by the death of his grandmother, the dowager Empress Friedrich, afew days previous. The congress was lavishly entertained by the cities of Berlin and Hamburg, as well as by the Zoological Society of Berlin. But the most extraordinary proof of the public interest in the congress was probably the fact that the entire “ Reichstagsgebaiide,”” the magnificent house of the German Parliament, was placed at the disposition of the Congress for its meetings, lectures, ete. Thusall the general sessions were held in the great ‘‘ Plenarsitzungssaal”’ of the Parliament. The Emperor himself, though prevented from receiving the members officially on account of the death of his mother, took occasion to greet them informally.
The more special object of my joining the congress was to take part in the deliberations and decisions of the committee on zoological nomenclature, of which I had _been elected a member at the congress in Cambridge in 1898. The work of the committee, which met before the congress opened and continued for some time after its close, occupied so much of the time of the members that the meetings of the sections had to be neglected. I was thus prevented from reading a paper on the Herpetology of Porto Rico, which had been announced, but was able to act as one of the vicepresidents at the second general session. The work in this committee on nomenclature was, on the whole, eminently satisfactory from the standpoint of American

<<<Page: 199>>>

zoologists, though it was found impossible to lay a draft for a complete code for the congress at its Berlin meeting. It is hoped that this will be accomplished at the next congress, which is to be held in Berne, Switzerland, in 1904. Very respectfully, LEONHARD STEJNEGER, Curator, Division of Reptiles and Batrachians. WASHINGTON, D. C., September 30, 1902.

By Otis Turron Mason,
Curator, Division of Ethnology.
Adde et bascuada et mille escaria. TERENCE, 12:46.
Barbara de pictis veni bascuada Britannis
Sed me jam mayult dicere Roma suum.
Aboriginal British or Pictish baskets and a thousand receptacles. says Terence, were carried to Rome by the successors of Julius Cesar, and Martial adds that the word ‘*basket” is Pictish,“ though the Romans would have us believe it to have been indigenous.
femnants of basketry are gathered from the Swiss lake dwellings, made in several of the technical processes well known to the American Indians and to be described later.
In the second volume of Keller's Lake Dwellings (pls. 154-137 are startlingly interesting groups of such basketry. You have, first of all, the methods of treating the bark of trees and flax to form the fiber in various stages of preparation. Network and frame weaving are also there illustrated, but in this place attention is drawn only to the basketry. On his Plate 134 may be seen plain checkerwork and twined work in 2-strand and 3-stand varieties, also coiled work in the following varieties: (”) Foundation of two rods, sewing done with bark strips so as to inclose both rods below, the stitches interlocking; (4) foundation of two rods, sewing inclosing them both, but not one of the rods underneath; the stitches interlock and split the upper portion of the one just below, as in many American baskets. The twined work of Robenhausen and Wangen is in a great number of varieties. There is solid, plain weaving; also open work twined weaving, the body being stems of plants; borders are held together with twined weaving. In some specimens of open work the warp of twined weaving is in pairs:
@On the derivation of the word, however, consult the New English Dictionary and the Century Dictionary.

<<<Page: 217>>>

but there are not shown in any of Keller’s plates the types of twined work in which the warp plays any part for ornamentation; and in the remains, so far as examined, no attempts are made at embroidery, or overlaying, or any of the species of fine decoration, to be seen in the Alaskan or Californian weaving.“
In the Arabian Nights, the story of the lady who was murdered by her husband mentions a very large basket, by its size reminding one of the granary baskets of California, but this was evidently in coiled work, very much in the style of the Hopi plaques. The Caliph, Haroun Alrasehid— came to the bank of the river, and the fisherman, having thrown in his net, when he drew it out again brought up a trunk, close shut and very heavy. The Caliph made the vizier pay him 100 sequins immediately and sent him away. Mesrour, by his master’s orders, carried the trunk on his shoulders, and the Caliph, eager to know what it contained, returned to the palace with all speed. When the trunk was opened, they found in it a large basket made of palm leaves, shut up, and the covering sewed with red thread. To satisfy the Caliph’s impatience, they cut the thread with a knife and took out of the basket a package wrapped in a sorry piece of hanging and bound about with rope, in which, when untied, they found, to their amazement, the dead body of a young lady cut in small pieces.
The Ute Indians in ancient times used basketry for mortuary purposes, but by them made of the rarest material and with faultless workmanship, adorned with symbols of their religion. The dead man or woman was covered with a large carrying basket, and all around were laid with loving care the finest specimens of the craft.
It is interesting to know that the first mention of baskets in the Bible is in connection with dreams. Joseph was a prisoner in Egypt. He had interpreted the butler’s dream so favorably that Pharaoh’s baker came also to him.
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, T also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head; and in the uppermost basket  for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days; yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
It may in general be assumed that the baskets used by the Israelites were not unlike those of the Egyptians. If the ancient baskets of Egypt resembled the modern, those mentioned were of the coiled type, made from palm leaf, resembling thick bread plaques of the Hopi pueblos of Arizona. They were doubtless in use throughout North Africa long before the days of Joseph.
Specimens of this type of ancient coiled basketry were dug up by Randatl-Maclver and Wilkin at El Armah, 6 miles south of the site of
«Ferdinand Keller, The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland and other parts of Europe, 2 vols., London, 1878.

Abydos, in middle Egypt. They are the oldest that have yet been found in the world. El Armah dates back to the earliest ‘* new race.” through the entire middle period down to the late prehistoric in Egypt. Far up the Nile the type persists. It will be seen in abundance at Aden, and it exists in much more elegant material in Hindustan. This proves the persistence of a single type through six thousand years. Long ago caravans took it into the heart of Africa, and the reader must not be surprised further on in discovering at least a limited sphere of influence for it in America, where the descendants of the Moors who invaded Spain left them.
The Greek word for basket is kaneon, or kanastron, from kanna, a reed, whence our cannister, through the Latin canistra. Or, to come closer to our theme, basketry was made long ago in the warmer countries of the Old World, as they are now in the New, from cane. In the time of Homer this word was applied frequently to receptacles of clay, bronze, and gold. Doubtless, in earlier ages the Greek women were nimble-fingered basket makers, but the forms are not preserved.
Wherever civilization has come in contact with lower races, whether in Britain, Africa, Polynesia, or America, it has found the woman enjoying the most friendly acquaintance with textile plants and skillful in weaving their roots, stems, and leaves into basketry, matting, and other similar products without machinery. Basketry was wellnigh universal throughout the Western Hemisphere before the discovery, while at least one-half of the area was devoid of pottery.
Ancient cemeteries, mounds, caves, ruins, and lake dwellings gave evidence of the high antiquity of the art in both continents. The researches of Holmes and Willoughby on mound pottery; of Yarrow and Schumacher in southwestern California; of Cushing, Fewkes, and Hough in ancient pueblos; of Nordenskjéld and Pepper in the cliff dwellings of the southwest; of G. O. Dorsey, of the Field Columbian Museum, and many European explorers in Peru, demonstrate that no changes have taken place in this respect, either in the variety of the technical processes or the fineness of the workmanship. There is an unbroken genealogy of basket making on the Continent, running back to the most ancient times.
For a time cheap patented ware made from veneering threatened to obliterate the ancient plicated basket, but at the same time the latter became exalted to a pastime and a fine art, and there were never so many genuine lovers of the handicraft as at present.
In the past few years a sympathetic spirit has been awakened in the United States to keep alive this charming aboriginal art and to preserve its precious relics. In every State in the Union will be found rich collections, both in public and private museums. People of wealth vie with one another in owning them. It almost amounts to a disease, which might be called ‘Scanastromania.” They resemble the

‘*merchantman seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that be had and bought it.” The genuine enthusiasm kindled in the search, the pride of success in the acquisition, the care bestowed upon them, witness that the basket is a wortby object of study. The story is told of a distinguished collector who walked many weary miles to the shelter of a celebrated old weaver. He spent the day admiring her work, but still asking for something better. He knew that she had made finer pieces. At last flattery and gold won. She tore out the back of her hut, and there, hid from mortal eyes, was the basket that was to be burned at her death. Nothing could be more beautiful, and it will be her monument.
I. DEFINITION OF BASKETRY A place for everything.—FRANKLIN,
Basketry is the mother of all loom work and beadwork. In that elaboration of industries, through which they pass from naturism to artificialism, from handwork to machine work, from human power to beast power, wind power, water power, steam or fire power, and electric power, the loom is no exception. The first and most versatile shuttles were women’s fingers. Machinery has added speed. But there are many niceties of technic to which the machine device can not yet aspire.
Over and above the sympathetie spirit engendered and the kind encouragement given to exquisite and most worthy artists by the collection of basketry, the study is a very important one from the side of culture. It is the alpha of an art in which billions of capital are invested, millions of human beings are employed, whose materials and products are transported to earth’s remotest limits, whose textures are sought by every tribe of mankind. It is from this last point of view that the present work is written.
The praises of men who invented the cotton gin, the power 1oom, and the tapestry loom will be repeated, and monuments erected to memorialize those who harnessed the forces of nature to do their bidding. Here a good word is said for the earlier, more primitive, women who made the others possible. It is true that pride in the ownership of an exquisite piece of work may be joined with frigid indifference toward the maker. It is to be hoped that with admiration of American basketry may be coupled a humane feeling for Indian women themselves, who have made so much genuine pleasure possible.
American basketry, ancient and modern, may be studied under the following subdivisions:
I. Definition of the art, its materials, tools, processes, and products.
II. Materials for basketry, with lists of plants, animals, minerals, including the Indian name, common names, scientific names.

or) .
These regions must be regarde if only as convenient divisions for reference. The last named is a measure of ignorance, rather, for. it could easily be divided into half a dozen regions. Again, before the balance of savagery had been violently disturbed by the discovery of the hemisphere there were migrations of native blood and speech and arts. Basketry further on will be witness to many of these.
Basketry is differentiated from network by the fact that the meshes of the latter are not formed by decussations, but by knots; and from loom products, not only by the material, which is usually less rigid, but by the workmanship, which is done by machinery. Needlework is approached in coiled basketry and beadwork borrows from all weaves. No wide gulf separates the different varieties of textiles, however. beginning with such coarse products as brush fences and fish weirs and ending with the finest lace and needlework.
In form basketry varies through the following classes of objects:
1. Flat mats or wallets, generally flexible.
2. Plaques or food plates, which are slightly concave. These occur in quality of the coarsest sieve to that of the sacred meal tray.
3. Bowls for mush and other foods and for ceremonial purposes, hemispherical in general outline.

<<<Page: 221>>>

4. Pots for cooking, with cylindrical sides and rounded or flat bottoms. These vary into cones, truncated cones, and trough-shaped baskets.
5. Jars and fanciful shapes, in which the mouth is constricted, frequently very small, and now and then supplied with cover. They are spindle shaped, pyriform, napiform, and, indeed, imitate fruits known to the natives. The influence of civilization in giving modern shapes to basketry has not always been beneficial to this class of forms.
W. H. Holmes, writing of the transition from service to decoration, speaks of form in and on basketry as (1) functional and essential only, (2) functional and wsthetic combined, and (3) as suprafunctional and wholly wsthetic.
There are two distinct types of technic in basketry, namely, (1) handwoven basketry, which is built on a warp foundation, and (2) sewed or coiled basketry, which is built on a foundation of rods, splints, or straws.
A, Checkerwork: The warp and the weft having the same width, thickness, and pliability.
2. Diagonal or twilled basketry: Two or more weft strands over two or more warp strands.
(. Wickerwork: Inflexible warp; slender, flexible weft.
DP). Wrapped weft, or single weft wrapped: The weft strand is wrapped, or makes a bight about the warp at each decussation, as in the Mohave A7ho.

I’. Two-rod and splint foundation.
G. Three-rod foundation.
/1. Splint foundation.
/. Grass-coil foundation.
AY. Fuegian coiled basketry.
These will be described at length in the proper place.
In basket-making there are several characteristics to be observed which will enable one to classify the objects and to refer them to their several tribal manufacturers. These characteristics are the material, the framework, the methods of weaving, the coiling or sewing, the border, the decoration, the use, ete.

<<<Page: 222>>>

The tool almost universally employed in the manufacture of coiled ware is a bone awl or pricker. Of the manipulation of the material previously to the weaving little is known.
In the technical drawings accompanying this paper the actual size of the specimens is generally indicated by a series of inch marks in the margin. The inches on the standard line are shown by spaces between dots. In order to indicate exactly the manner of weaving, a square, usually an inch in dimension, is taken from a portion of the surface wherein all the methods of manipulation occur. This square is enlarged sufticiently to make the structure comprehensible. This plan enables one to show form and ornamentation in the whole figure, as well as the method of treatment in the enlarged inch.
The writer is indebted to a large number of friends in various parts of the United States, especially on the Pacific slope, who have given him access to their valuable collections, furnished information, and sent photographs. — Especial thanks are due to F. V. Coville for writing the chapter on plants, to William H. Holmes for advice in matters of ornamentation, and to Dr. C. Hart Merriam for privilege of studying the precious collection made by him. Many friends who have generously given their special knowledge and supplied photographs and illustrations will be mentioned in the proper place. At the same time he would express his admiration of their zeal and generosity, through which the Sybilline leaves of an almost lost chapter in human industrial history has been rescued from oblivion.
With a few exceptions the makers of baskets are women. In the division of labor belonging to the lowest stages of culture the industrial arts were fostered by women, the military and ageressive arts by men. It is a well-known rule in these first stages of progress that, with few exceptions, the user of an implement or utensil was the maker of it. There are people on the earth among whom the men are the basket makers. Indeed, for ceremonial purposes our own Indian priests or medicine men are frequently the makers of their own basket drums, ete.
As soon as the products of this art entered into the world’s commerce, and uncanny machinery was necessary for the manufacture, the art of basket weaving passed from the hands of its foster mothers and became man’s work, but in the Western Hemisphere almost exclusively the basket makers have been women.
It is a matter of profound regret that already over much of the United States the art has degenerated, or at least has been modified. In methods, forms, and colors truly old things have passed away, and, behold, all things have become new. But proof is forthcoming that the contrary is true in some places. The Hyde Expedition and other associations have made determined efforts to resist the demoralizing influences of trade.

<<<Page: 223>>>

This process of extinction has gone on with differing rapidity in the several areas. Nothing ancient in mechanical processes, in form, and design can be predicated of the basketry sold at summer resorts. The trees are felled by the white man and the trunks divided into ribbons by his latest machinery. The Indian woman uses a steel gauge to regulate the width of her weft, steel awls for sewing. Even in Western ware the demand and influence of mercenary motives drown the cry of the ancient spirit in the lowly artist. Plate 1 will show the conflict for preeminence between the old and the new. Dogs and horses are mingled with designs older than the Discovery. (See also Plates 42, 168.)
But it is not alone the unrefined public who eliminate the delightful classic from the decoration of basketry; men and women with the most exalted motives have for centuries substituted European and Asiatic forms for aboriginal in basketry.
Plate 2 is worthy of notice in this regard. Eliminate the human figures altogether as pictorial and realistic and without standing in an art whose designs are preeminently symbolical. The others are divided into two series, those bearing some suggestion of old patterns and those covered with classical fretwork as the underlying motive and then run wild with savage freehand. (See also Plates 50, 58, 233.)
The reason for the genuine unspoiled art of the tribes in northwestern California is given by Carl Purdy. The Franciscan fathers who built the missions in the central and southern portions of the State never penetrated these wilds; the traders of the Hudson’s Bay Company, whose presence and traffic changed the arts of other Indians so profoundly, did not come so far south, and Mexican soldiers were driven out of the country. It was not until settlers in the middle of the last century began to maltreat the Indians that bloody conflicts arose which resulted in their present status, but, fortunately, these pioneers had no interest in baskets and probably did not notice them. There are in possession of old families in the Eastern States baskets sent home by the Forty-niners that now are worth their weight in gold. The forms and designs on these are similar to many still made. This indicates that the art has kept its old-time purity.
It must be distinctly understood that many basket-making Indians are not now in their priscan homes. Besides the migration occasioned by the ordinary motives operating on the minds of savages, the rapid intrusion of white settlers and the strong arm of the Government have hastened these movements. For our purposes these compulsory migrations must be noted specially in the case of basket makers. For example, on the Round Valley reservations in northern California are the Concow (Pujunan); and from the eastern side of the Sacramento Valley, the Nomelakki and Wailaki (Copehan), Little Lakes (Kulanapan), Ukie (Yukian), and Pit rivers (Palaihnahan), belonging to five absolutely different linguistic families. Now, in‘a collection of baskets

<<<Page: 224>>>

from Round Valley one must not be surprised to find shapes, uses, decorations, and names for the same form or part or design extremely varied and mixed.
The author is aware that he has come far short of doing justice to histheme. Omissions will be noticed, and it is feared that some references of work to the wrong band or tribe have been made. This is unavoidable in a great museum. It is only in such rare collections as have been gathered with one’s own hands that such errors can be avoided.
So much is said and written on the subject of Indian basketry that a vocabulary is desirable. On some terms all are even now agreed, All things considered, words in common use should be adopted. There are, as before mentioned, two absolutely different kinds of technic employed, dividing basketry into woven and coiled. The former leads to the loom, the latter to the needle. It is not correct to speak of warp and weft in the latter, only in the former; the parts of coiled basketry are the foundation and the sewing. The following terms and definitions are suggested, not arbitrarily, but subject always to amendment and common consent. Words from Indian languages are purposely omitted. A few of them, however, ought to be retained, such as **tee,” for the Pomo twined weaving:
Basket.—A vessel or receptacle in textile material; a technic product resembling this.
Basketry.—A general term including (1) basket making, the process or art; (2) basket work, the technic or stitches, any textile motive resembling work in baskets; (5) basket ware, a collection of finished products.
Beading.—A strip of bark or a splint run in and out through the spaces in woven or among the stitches in coiled basketry.
Braidwork.—Fabric in which three or more elements are braided, as in some three-strand twined basketry. See Hulse brard. Preferred to the word plaited. There may be flat, round, or square braid. The term sennit is also allowable.
Buttonhole stitch.—A series of half hitches, as in Fuegian coiled basketry.
Check.—W here warp and weft cross.
Checkerwork.—Basket work in which the warp and weft are equally flexible and the checks are square, or at least rectangular.
Chevron. —V-shaped ornament, in which two or more colored lines meet at an angle; for example, the device on the sleeve of a noncommissioned officer. (See //err/nghone and Zigzag.)
Chinking.—Soft materials between hard stems in the foundation of coiled basketry.
NAT Mus 1902——138

<<<Page: 225>>>

Coil.—An element in basketry ornamentation. The varieties are plain coil, reversed coil, loop coil, continuous loop coil.
Coiled basketry.—Vype of basket work in which a foundation of hard or soft material, arranged in a spiral, is held together by means of over-and-over sewing.
Crossed warp.—Type of basket work in which two sets of warp cross each other at an angle—for interlacing weft, for seizing or wrapping (Makah), or for twined weaving, common in Attu wallets.
Decussations.— Crossing of warp at acute angles.
Diagonal weaving.— Passing weft over two or more warp elements, but not the same in adjoining rows. Used here chiefly of twined weaving to distinguish it from twilled weaving with single weft element; also running the weft at an angle, as in matting.
Diaper.—& surface decoration which shows a pattern by the relief or direction of warp and weft.
Designs.—Figures and patterns used in the ornamentation of basketry. Must not be confounded with Symbol.
Embroidery.—Ornamentation added after the basket is finished. (See False embroidery.)
Fagotting.—Same as [Hemstitch.
False braid.—An appearance of braid work on the margin of a basket made with a single splint in ball stitch or ‘* racking-seizing.”
* False embroidery.—An appearance of embroidery made on Tlinkit and other twined ware by wrapping the strands on the outside with colored material in the process of weaving.
Fiber.—A flexible substance composed of filaments such as cedar bark, wild hemp, ete.
Frap.—To bind one element about another.
Fret.—The Greek ornament occurring in endless variety on basketry.
Furcate.—Said of stitches in coiled sewing intentionally and symmetrically split—bifureate, trifurcate, ete.
/ylfot.—Ornament imitating a Greek cross with arms extended at right angles, all in the same direction; called also Swastika.
Gorrita.—The shallow basket bowl of the Pimas and other southwestern tribes.
Hemstitch.—Drawing warps together in groups of two or more and holding them by twined weavings. Seen in Aleutian openwork wallets. Called also fagotting.
Herringbone.—Basketry designs in which chevron patterns are in parallel series.
Herringbone border.
On coiled basketry a finish in which with a single splint the appearance of 3-ply braid is given. (See False braid.)
L[Titched weft.—Basket work in which the weft makes a half hitch about each warp element. In coiled work it would be hitched sewing, same as buttonhole stitch,

<<<Page: 226>>>

Il. MATERIALS FOR BASKETRY Man is one world, and hath another to-attend him.—EMERSON.
In the manufacture of their baskets the Indians have ransacked the three kingdoms of nature—mineral, animal, and vegetal. For the first named Cushing has shown how the Havasupai Indians line the inside of a basket with clay in order to render it fireproof. A great many of the paints or dyes with which the baskets are colored are drawn from the mineral kingdom. In the decoration of basketry beautiful stones and the mineral shells of mollusks are employed, either whole or cut into beads and pendants. (See Plate 3.)
Besides the beautiful shells, teeth, wings of insects, and other hard animal substances used for added ornament, softer parts enter into the very texture of basket work. In a few localities the tribes have relied on them largely. It will be seen that wool of goat, sheep, and llama are treated in precisely the same manner as splints of wood. The undressed skins of smaller mammals, notably the rabbit, are cut into strings and twisted; and dressed hides into babiche to serve as weft in woven basketsand bags. Sinew thread was employed in making coiled basketry about the Great Lakes and farther north. But the most serviceable animal substance for basketry was the feather, its plume for decoration and its quill for hard work as well as ornament. Porcupine quills were likewise split and worked into coiled basketry, in addition to their embellishment of birch-bark utensils. The multitude of uses for feathers in this art will be described later.
The chief dependence, however, of the basket maker is upon the vegetal kingdom. Nearly all parts of plants have been used by one tribe or another for this purpose
roots, stems, bark, leaves, fruits, seeds, and gums. It would seem as though in each area for purposes intended the vegetal kingdom had been thoroughly explored and exhausted above ground and under ground. Is it not marvelous to think that unlettered savages should know so much botany? Mr. Ches: nut, in his Plants used by Indians of Mendocino County, California, calls attention to the fact that in our advanced state we are yet behind these savages, not having caught up with them in the discovery and uses of some of their best textile materials.

<<<Page: 229>>>

How did the savages find out that the roots of certain plants hid away under the earth were the best possible material for this function 4 And for another use the stem of a plant had to be found, perhaps miles away, so that in the makeup of a single example leagues would have to be traveled and much discrimination used. Unless the utmost care is exercised the fact will be overlooked that often three or four kinds of wood will be used in the monotonous work of the weft. One is best for the bottom, another is light and tough for the body, a third is best for the flexible top. This in addition to the employment of half a dozen others for designs, for warp or foundation, or for decorative purposes.
Among the basket maker’s materials must not be forgotten the demand for water-tight vessels. Besides the widely spread faculty of securing this result by texture, there were present in certain areas natural substances such as the gum of the pinyon (Pinus edulis), the resin of various pines, and even the mineral asphalt.
The making of canteens and other water vessels, in lieu of pottery, in this way was most prevalent among the Shoshonean tribes of the Interior Basin and the migratory Apache farther south. Barrows“ ‘alls attention to Humboldt’s Essay on New Spain,’ in which the Indians around Santa Barbara are spoken of as ‘* presenting the Spaniards with vases very curiously wrought of stalks of rushes” and ‘‘covered within with a very thin layer of asphaltum that renders them impenetrable to water.”
The author is greatly indebted to Mr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist of thee Department of Agriculture, for the identification of plants used in basketry by the Indians of America north of Mexico. This list contains those that have been certainly identified. There are other plants alleged to be used in basketry, but of which no scientific determination has been made as yet. A complete discussion of this part of the subject would demand that for each tribe making baskets there should be a list of the plants employed by them, and for each plant used a list of the tribes by whom it is used. Such a discussion requires a long and tedious investigation by a number of talented workers cooperating. It is hoped that the chapter here given by Mr. Coville will be a starting point for a complete study of Indian phytotechny.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. Lo?
PLANTS USED IN BASKETRY By FREDERICK VY. COVILLE.
While some of the materials used by American Indian tribes in their basketry have long been known, by far the larger number had not been identified with precision prior to the beginning of the past decade. Most students of Indian plants had been satistied with casual names applied by themselves or given to them by botanists after the examination of fragmentary specimens. Since the year 1890 a few botanists, notably Mr. V. Kk. Chesnut, of the Department of Aericulture, have turned their attention to the plants used by the aborigines and have made new records with definite identifications of the plants concerned, covering among other subjects of Indian activity that of basketry. When, therefore, after Professor Mason’s invitation to prepare a chapter on the subject, the compilation of existing records was begun it was found that the earlier publications contained much that was indefinite, considerable that was incorrect, and a little that was both correct and exact. The notable exception to the general rule was the publications of Dr. Edward Palmer, whose work as a botanical collector in the western United States and Mexico extended from the late sixties of the last century to the present time. Under the circumstances it was determined to admit only such matter as was capable of verification, based, first, on the writer’s own observation; second, on published records that seemed to come under the last of the categories mentioned above; and, third, on the collections of the United States National Museum. <A few unverified statements have been admitted for the purpose of bringing them to the attention of those who may be in a position to verify them. In the case of statements which did not originate with the writer a parenthetic reference indicates the source of the information and, if published, the year of its publication. The work as here presented is recognized as by no means complete, but it is offered as a substantial basis for future investigation.
Acer macrophyllum. Oregon Maple. Piil-gun/-shi (Yuki).
The Indians of Mendocino County, California, particularly the Concows, who now occupy a reservation there, use the white inner bark, preferably gathered in spring, in making baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) From its inner bark the Indians of the Pacific slope make baskets so closely woven as to hold water. (J.T. Rothrock, 1867.)
Adiantum pedatum. Maidenhair Fern.
The slender, black or dark-brown, shining stems, after splitting, are used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California, in the orna

<<<Page: 231>>>

mentation of some of their baskets, particularly those worn as hats. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) The Hupa Indians of Humboldt County, California, and other nearby tribes use the stems in the same way. The practice extends also to the Snohomish Indians of western Washington (C. M. Buchanan, letter) and to the Tlinkit Indians of southern Alaska. (G. T. Emmons, letter).
Agave deserti. Desert Agave.
In the coiled basket bowls of the Coahuilla Indians of southern California the cleaned fiber from the leaves is used to form the first few turns of the coil, which is then continued with grass stems. Evidently the grass is not sufficiently flexible to make these first turns without breaking, but the Agave fiber answers the purpose admirably. (Cat. Nos. 207580 and 207581, U.S.N.M.) Some of the basket hats of the Dieguefio Indians of San Diego County, California, are woven from cords made of the cleaned and twisted fiber, and from their great strength must be almost indestructible by any ordinary wear. (Cat.
No. 19751, U.S.N.M.) Alnus oregana. Red Alder.
Among the Hupa Indians of northern California the roots are sometimes used as weft at the beginning of a basket and ina round between the bottom and the sides (P. EK. Goddard, notes).
Alnus rhombifolia. White Alder.
Various species of alder have been used by the American aborigines to produce an orange or red-brown dye, but the only authenticated use of alder in dyeing basket materials seems to be that of Adnas rhombifolia among the Hupa, Yuki, and other Indians of northern California. The dye is obtained from the bark by infusion in water, or sometimes the bark is chewed and the material to be dyed is drawn through the mouth.
Amaranthus palmeri. Amaranth. Ko/-mo (Moki). This is the source of a pink to purple dye used in the coiled and wicker plaques of the Moki Indians of northern Arizona. (W. Hough, notes.) The identification is by C. F. Millspaugh.
Amelanchier alnifolia. Sarviceberry. [-ta’-gé (Apache). Chak (Klamath).
The small, straight, peeled branches of this and other species of Amelanchier are used by the Apaches of the White Mountain Indian Reservation, Arizona, to form the uprights in their large carrying baskets, a use for which the very tough wood is well adapted. The

<<<Page: 232>>>

Klamath Indians of Oregon often weave a stout branch, peeled or not peeled, into the rims of their large coarse baskets to stiffen and strengthen them.
Apocynum cannabinum. Indian Hemp.
The well-known Indian hemp, including a number of plant forms once referred to Apocynunm cannabinum, but now treated as belonging to several species, occurs from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast and was and still is widely used by the aborigines in the making of many kinds of cordage articles. It is commonly cited as an Indian basket material, and although it has not been possible to secure a verifiable record of its use in a basket, it is altogether probable that some of the strings and cords so frequently used in beginning a basket, or in making the carrying loops, are twisted from the inner bark of this plant. (See illustration in Chesnut’s Plants used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California.”
Artemisia ludoviciana. Wormwood. Hang-al (Coahuilla).
In that portion of the Colorado Desert of California known as the Cabeson Valley the Coahuilla Indians make from the stems of this plant the large granary baskets in which they store seeds and other dried vegetable foods. (D. P. Barrows, 1900.) The plant was identified by W. L. Jepson.
Arundinaria tecta. Cane.
The split outer portion of the stems of the cane was the favorite basket material of the Southern Indians, including the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Creeks, Seminoles, and other tribes from Texas and Arkansas to the Carolinas, and it is still in use among the remnants of these peoples. The handsome baskets of the Chetimacha and Attakapa Indians of Louisiana are made from split cane.
Berberis nervosa. Oregon Grape.
Among the Hupa Indians of northern California a yellow dye is obtained by steeping the twigs and bark of one of the species of evergreen barberry, or Oregon grape. (Mary H. Manning, letter.) Leaves of squaw grass (Xerophyllum tenaw) dyed with this are sometimes used in the yellow patterns occasionally seen in the Hupa hat baskets. The same material and dye are used in the huckleberry baskets of the Snohomish (C. M. Buchanan, letter) and Klikitat Indians of western Washington. The particular species used has been definitely identified in one instance as Berher/s nervosa. Another species, B. aquifolium, is undoubtedly used also.

202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1902. Betula populifolia. White Birch.
The soft wood of this tree is still employed in the northeastern United States and Canada by the descendants of the Algonkin and Iroquois in the making of baskets. (VY. Havard, 1890.) These baskets are thoroughly modernized and doubtless give little idea of the aboriginal methods of using this material.
Bromus sitchensis. Bromegrass.
The split stems are sometimes used by the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast as an overlaying material for the white patterns of spruce-root baskets. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)
Butneria occidentalis. Calycanthus. Sai ka-le’ (Pomo).
Both the wood and the bark from young shoots of this shrub are used in basketry by the Indians of Mendocino County, California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)
Calamagrostis langsdorffii. Bluejoint. Chu/’-kan shark ki-kark-tush’ (Tlinkit).
The split stem is sometimes used for overlaying material in the spruce-root baskets of the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast. (G. T. Emmons, notes. )
Carex barbarae. Sedge. Ka-hum/ (Pomo).
The long, tough, woody, interior portion of the rootstocks of this sedge is used to form the white sewing strands in the fine coiled baskets of the Pomo Indians of northern California. Among the neighboring Wailakis the roots of another unidentified species of Carex are used in the same way, and the leaves are made into hats and crude, somewhat flexible baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)
Carthamus tinctorius. : False Saffron.
A-sap-zran/-i (Moki, from the Spanish). ] > i }
This plant, introduced by the Spanish, produces a bright yellow dye, used in basketry by the Moki Indians’ of northern Arizona. (W. Hough, notes; Cat. Nos. 11724 and 11726, U.S.N.M.)
Ceanothus integerrimus. California Lilac. Hi/’-bi (Concow).
The long, flexible shoots are used in basket making by the Concows of northern California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)

<<<Page: 234>>>

Cercis occidentalis. Redbud. Ché-e (Yuki).
The wood of the branches, with or without the bark, is used in basketry by many California tribes, notably by the Round Valley Indians of northern California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902). Among the Nishinam Indians of Bear Valley, Placer County, the willow foundations in certain coiled baskets are sewed together with a thread of redbud wood. (Stephen Powers, 1877.) The dark red patterns in the baskets of the Pit River Indians and the Tulare Indians are formed from split branches with the bark left on.
Ceropteris triangularis. Goldenback.
This little fern, known usually as Gymnogramma triangular/s, has a black stipe or stem which is sometimes used by the Round Valley Indians (V. K. Chesnut, 1902) and the Hupa Indians (Mary H. Manning, letter) of northern California as a substitute for maidenhair stems, when these are not available, in black basket patterns.
Chrysothamnus laricinus. Rabbitbrush. Ma/-i-bi (Moki).
The branches are sometimes used by the Moki Indians of northeastern
Arizona for the weft of their finer wicker plaques. (W. Hough, notes.)
Chrysothamnus moquianus. Rabbitbrush.
Ha/’-no shi’-va-pi (Moki).
The twigs are used at Oraibi, Arizona, to form the weft in the wicker plaques of the Moki Indians. (W. Hough, notes.) The identification of the plant (U.S. Nat. Herb. 274057) is by E. L. Greene, the species being one closely related to the widely distributed Chrysothamnus | Bigelovia| graveolens.
Cinna latifolia. Wood Reedgrass. Chu/’-kan shark (Tlinkit).
Among the grasses employed by the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast for the white patterns in their spruce-root baskets this species is the commonest. The part used is the stem, from which sections are split to be applied as an overlay on the spruce-root strands. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)
Cladium mariscus. Cladium. From the root, coiled baskets of excellent quality are made by
tribes on the lower Sierra from Fresno River to Kern River, California. (C. Hart Merriam, 1903.) Identified by Miss Alice Eastwood.
Corylus californica. Hazelnut. Ol mam (Yuki).
The shoots of the hazelnut are used by many of the Indian tribes from northern California to Washington, west of the Cascade Moun

<<<Page: 235>>>

tains, in the making of baskets, especially as radials or uprights. (Mary H. Manning, letter.) The burden basket, baby basket, and salmon plate of the Hupas are made entirely of the shoots of hazelnut. (P. E. Goddard, notes.) (See Plate 4.)
Coviliea tridentata. Creosote Bush.
A gum-lac found upon the branches of this desert bush has a wide application among the southwestern Indians as a cement and among the Cocopas of northern Lower California it is used for pitching baskets. (KE. Palmer, notes.) The gum, which occurs in conspicuous nodules of a reddish amber color, is not a direct exudation from the plant, but is deposited by a minute scale insect, Carterda larreae.
Dasylirion wheeleri. Sotol.
The leaves, split into strands about a quarter of an inch wide and the coarse marginal teeth removed, are used among the Pima Indians of southern Arizona in coarse twilled baskets. (Cat. No. 218027,
Delphinium scaposum. Larkspur. So-ro’-si (Moki).
The flowers are the source of a light-blue dye used by the Moki Indians of northern Arizona in their coiled and wicker plaques. (W. Hough, notes.)
Deschampsia caespitosa. Tufted Hairgrass. Kuit-ktik-kli’-te shark (Tlinkit).
This is one of the grasses the split stems of which are used among the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast to form the white patterns on their spruce-root baskets. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)
Dondia suffrutescens. Sea Blite.
The Coahuilla Indians of the Colorado desert in southern California, blacken the stems of their basketry rush (Juncus acutus) by steeping them for several hours in a decoction of this plant. (E. Palmer, 1878.) The identification of the species is by W. L. Jepson.
Elymus mollis. Beach Rye.
The split stems of this grass are sometimes used for the white patterns in the spruce-root baskets of the Tlinkit Indians on the south Alaskan coast. ‘This material is employed only for coarse work, and when other grasses better adapted for the purpose are not available. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 205 Epicampes rigens. Epicampes.
In the region of the Mohave and Colorado deserts of southeastern California the Panamint, Coahuilla (D. P. Barrows, 1900), and other tribes use this grass for the packing of their coiled baskets. The part used, at least in the better baskets, is that portion of the stem above the uppermost joint, which sometimes reaches a leneth of 45 centimeters (18 inches).
Equisetum palustre. Horsetail. Dabts (Snohomish). Hin mitin-i’ (Tlinkit).
The rootstocks of this plant, which sometimes reach a diameter of 1.5 centimeters (% inch) and a length of 20 centimeters (8 inches) between the joints, were used in the early days, though rarely now, in the patterns on spruce-root Thnkit baskets of the south Alaskan coast. Strips are split from the surface of the rootstock and used as an overlaying material. The color is a rich, very dark purple, which appears asa black. (G.T> Emmons, notes.) A similar use was made of the plant, in their cedar-root baskets, by the Snohomish Indians, of Puget Sound, Washington. (C. M. Buchanan, notes.)
Equisetum robustum. Scouring Rush.
The coal-black surface of the rootstock is sometimes used by the Cowlitz Indians of southwestern Washington as a substitute for the rootstock of Ayuisetum palustre in the black overlay patterns on cedarroot baskets.
Evernia vulpina. Wolf Moss, Se’-ho-li (Tlinkit). Swii/-u-sam (Klamath).
This yellow tree-lichen was widely used as a dye by the Indians of the timbered area of the western United States. The Klamath Indians of Oregon, as well as the Hupas of northern California (Mary H. Manning, letter), use this dye in their baskets, the coloring matter being extracted by boiling. In the case of the Hupas the dye is applied to Xerophyllum leaves, but the Klamaths use it only for the porcupine quills which form the beautiful canary yellow patterns of their twisted tule baskets. The Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast also use the dye in their spruce-root baskets, the lichen being secured by them not on the coast, but from the interior. (G. T. Emmons, notes.) (See Plate 5.)
Fraxinus nigra. Black Ash.
The remnants of the Six Nations in New York, Pennsylvania, and adjacent portions of Canada make extensive use of ash, presumably black ash, in their modern splint-basket industry. (IT. Donaldson, 1894.)

<<<Page: 237>>>

Helianthus petiolaris. Sunflower. A-ka/-u-shi (Moki).
The seeds are used by the Moki Indians of northern Arizona to make a blue dye for use in both coiled and wicker plaques. (W. Hough, notes.) The color produced in the coiled plaques, on sewing material of Yucca glauca, is of a dark, almost prussian-blue shade, when the sewing strands are applied with their broken inner surface outward, but of a much lighter shade when the epidermal surface is outward. (Cat. No. 128708, U.S.N.M.)
Hicoria ovata. Hickory.
The wood of some unidentified species of hickory, probably //icoréa ovata, is employed among the remnants of the Six Nations in New York, Pennsylvania, and adjacent portions of Canada in the manufacture of modern splint baskets. (T. Donaldson, 1894.) The inner bark of a hickory is used by the North Carolina Cherokees for yellow patterns in their baskets. (Cat. No. 63077, U.S.N.M.)
Hilaria jamesii. Galleta. Ta’-ka-shu (Moki).
The stems of this grass, roughly stripped of leaves and seeds, are used for the filling in of the coiled plaques of the Moki Indians of northern Arizona. (W. Hough, 1898.) In the first few turns of the spiral, which are too short to be made of the grass stems, the packing is of shredded leaves of Yucca glauca. (Cat. No. 128467, U.S.N.M.)
Juglans nigra. Black Walnut.
The Cherokee Indians of North Carolina use the split inner bark to make black patterns in their baskets. (Cat. No. 63077, U.S.N.M.)
Juncus acutus. Rush.
The Coahuilla Indians of the Colorado Desert, southern California, use the stems to make patterns in their coiled basket bowls. The material, as gathered in a marsh at Palm Springs, is immersed for several days in the muddy water of the spring to render it flexible, and is then dyed a dark olivaceous or almost black color with the juice of a sea blite. (EK. Palmer, notes.) (See Dondia suffrutescens.)
Juncus balticus. Rush. Tsin-a/-u (Klamath). Kloh-tso’-sé (Apache).
The stems of this rush, which is commonly known as wire grass, are often used by Indian children to make small baskets. The praetice has been noted among the Klamaths of Oregon and the White Mountain Apaches of the Arizona plateau.

<<<Page: 238>>>

Juncus effusus. Rush, Lal’-tim (Yuki).
The stems of this rush, or wire grass, are used amond the Round Valley Indians of Mendocino County, California, to make temporary baskets, particularly in teaching the Indian girls the art of basketry. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.
Juncus textilis. Basket Rush. The Luisefo Indians of southern California use the split stems of this rush as the sewing material of their coiled baskets. (C. Hart Merriam, notes.) The varying natural colors of the stem at different heights produce a very attractive effect. Libocedrus decurrens. Post Cedar. Wu/-lu-ansh (Klamath). The split wood of this tree is occasionally woven into rough V-shaped pack baskets by the Klamath Indians of Oregon.
Lonicera interrupta. Honeysuckie. Hai-wat’ (Yuki).
The long flexible stems are used to a slight extent among the Round Valley Indians of California in the coiled *‘*one-stick ” baskets, in which the foundation consists of a single stem. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902, and notes. )
Martynia louisiana. Devil Horns. Ta-g’at/-6 (Apache).
This plant, which is often known in books as the unicorn plant, has a large green pod with a slender terminal projection. At maturity the green outer layer becomes dry and falls off, the remaining interior portion of the projection splitting into two parts or horns which are exceedingly tough and black, and sometimes reach a length of 35 centimeters (13 inches). Moistened and split they are used extensively to make black patterns in the baskets of various Indian tribes, notably the Apaches, in the desert region of Arizona, southern Nevada, and southeastern California.
Panicularia nervata. Manna (Grass.
Among the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast, strips split from the internodes of this grass are sometimes used as an overlay for the patterns in spruce-root baskets, either white or variously dyed. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)
Parosela emoryi. Parosela.
The Coahuilla Indians, of the Colorado Desert, in southeastern California, give a yellowish-brown color to the rush (Juncus acutus) they
use in basket making by steeping it in water with the branches of this plant. (KE. Palmer, 1878.)

<<<Page: 239>>>

Philadelphus gordonianus. Syringa. Han/-li (Yuki).
The pithy stems of this shrub, which is locally known as arrowwood, are employed by the Indians of Mendocino County, California, in the manufacture of baskets for carrying babies, a use to which the stems, on account of their lightness, are well adapted. (VY. K. Chesnut, 1902.) Phragmites phragmites. Reed.
Tkap (Klamath).
The white patterns in the twisted-tule baskets of the Klamath and Modoe Indians of Oregon are made from this reed. The part used is the shining surface covering of the stem, taken from less thrifty plants, particularly those which have produced no flower cluster.
Plate 6 is a twined gambling tray of the Klamath Indians living on the head waters of Klamath River, Oregon. The warp is of twined tule stems, the body of the weft is of the same material, the overlaying in white is with split pieces from the stem of the reed. The black is twisted tule dyed in mud springs, the yellow borders of the trefoil are in porcupine quills dyed with wolf moss.
Design unknown; the projections on the large ornaments are called arrowheads. Collection of Frederick V. Coville.
Picea sitchensis. Sitka Spruce. Sit (Tlinkit).
The roots of this tree, boiled and split, are the basis material of the baskets manufactured by the Tlinkit Indians of Yakutat Bay, Alaska. (F. Funston, 1896.) The same use prevails among the Tlinkits of the Alexander Archipelago, notably those of Sitka, Juneau, and Douglas. The Indians of Neah Bay, Washington, and doubtless other tribes also, use the split roots for their coarse burden baskets. (See Plate 7.)
Pinus edulis. Arizona Nut Pine. O-bi’ (Apache).
The Apaches of the White Mountain district, Arizona, use the resin of this tree, often called pinyon, as a pitching material for their water baskets.
Pinus lambertiana. Sugar Pine.
Slender strands split from the root of the sugar pine, woven about uprights of California hazel, are the foundation material of the acornsoup baskets of the Hupa Indians, northern California. To make them split more easily the roots are steamed by burying them in sand and building a fire over them. (Mary H. Manning, letter.)
Pinus monophylila. Nevada Nut Pine.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 209 Pinus ponderosa. Yellow Pine.
The split wood of the root is one of the materials used by the Hupa Indians of northwestern California for the principal part of the weft in closely-woven baskets. (P. E. Goddard, notes. )
Pinus sabiniana. Digger Pine. Pol/-kim ol (Yuki).
The Little Lake Indians of Mendocino County, California, use the split roots to make their large V-shaped baskets for carrying acorns. The root is warmed in hot damp ashes, and the strands are split off before cooling. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) A similar use extends northward among the Hupa and other California coast Indians as far as Klamath River. (V. Havard, 1890.) ?
Populus trichocarpa. Balm of Gilead.
In northwestern California the Hupa Indians sometimes used the root to fasten the ribs of their baskets at the beginning and to form a round at the base of the sides of the basket. (P. E. Goddard, notes.)
Pseudotsuga mucronata. Red Fir.
According to the authority of J. W. Hudson, the Pomo Indians of Mendocino County, California, use the roots of this tree in the manufacture of some of their fine baskets.
Pteridium aquilinum. Bracken. 3is (Calpella).
A form of the common bracken occurring in the western United States is occasionally employed as a basket material among the Indians of Mendovino County, California. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.) The part used is the two flat strips of black hard-celled tissue in the rootstock.
Quercus alba. White Oak.
Splints from the wood of a white oak, presumably this species, are still used by the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina as the material for certain of their baskets. (Cat. No. 6380738, U.S.N.M.)
Quercus lobata. California White Oak.
The Concow Indians of Mendocino County, California, sometimes blacken their basket strands of redbud (Cere/s occtdental/s) on which the bark is still attached, by soaking them in water containing the bark of this oak and scraps of rusty iron. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)

Hudson, of a dye sometimes used to stain the purest black strands of the Pomo basketry. Rhus trilobata. Threeleaf Sumac. Si/-i-bi (Moki). Chil-chin (Navaho). Tséh’ kan’-i (Apache).
Among the desert Indians the slender branches of this bush are used extensively, perhaps more extensively than any other plant except willow, in the manufacture of their baskets. For warp the peeled branches are used. . For weft and for the sewing material of coiled baskets the branch is usually split into three strips and the bark and brittle tissue next the pith removed, leaving a flat tough strand. The use of the threeleaf sumac has been noted among the Apache, Panamint, Paiute, Navaho (W. Matthews, 1886), Moki (W. Hough, 1898), and Coahuilla (D. P. Barrows, 1900). (See Plate 8.)
Salix. Willow.
Brancnes from various undetermined species of willow were widely used among the western Indians, probably more generally than any other plant, particularly in the various forms of coarser baskets. Among the tribes in which travelers have recorded the manufacture of willow baskets, in addition to those given below under the identified species of willow, are the Mission, Mohave, Coahuilla, Cocopa, Yuma, and Coconino Indians of Arizona and southern California; the Zufi of New Mexico; the Hupa, Yurok, Modoc, Chimariko, Gualala, Nishinam, and Yokut of northern and middle California, and the Tinné of the Yukon Valley, Alaska. The split roots of willow are sometimes used for the weft in beginning the hat baskets of the Hupa Indians.

Salix argophylla. Willow. Bam ka-le’ (Pomo).
The Pomo Indians near Ukiah, California, consider this their best
willow for the manufacture of coarse baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)
Salix lasiandra. " Willow.
A willow, which is referable to Saléx las‘andra in its broad sense, is used to some extent by the Panamint Indians of Inyo County, California, in their twined baskets, and by the Apaches of the White Mountain Reservation, Arizona.

rial of their coiled baskets, by soaking them for about a week in an infusion of the berry stems of this elder. (D. P. Barrows, 1900.)
Savastana odorata. Holygrass.
The Indians of the northeastern United States and adjacent parts of Canada, such as the Penobscots of Maine (V. Havard, 1890) and the Abenakis of Ontario (Cat. No. 206394, U.S.N.M.), use the long, sweetscented leaves of this grass in some of their baskets.
Scirpus lacustris. Tule. Ma/-i (Klamath).
The principal basket material of the Klamath and Modoe Indians of Oregon is the tule, a plant widely used by the tribes of the Pacific coast States in the manufacture of mats. Narrow strips from the surface of the stem are twisted into long threads and these used for their finer twined baskets, giving a great variety of green and brown shades or, when dyed, a black. For coarser baskets whole or split stems are commonly employed, without twisting. The very slender roots of the tule, which occur in great abundance on the stout rootstocks, are used, without any other preparation than drying, to make patterns of a maroon color in the twisted tule baskets. (See Plate 9.)
Scirpus maritimus. Bulrush. Tsu-ish’ (Pomo).
The Pomo Indians of California use for the brown and black patterns of their fine coiled baskets a fiber extracted from the rootstock of this bulrush. Structurally the fiber is the same as that described under Carex barbarae. The identitication is by Miss Alice Eastwood.
Smilax californica. Greenbriar.
The long and exceedingly strong stems, brought from the watershed of the Sacramento River, are sometimes employed by the Indians of Mendocino County, California, in their basketry. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)
Thelesperma gracile. Thelesperma. O-ha/-u-shi (Moki).
A decoction of the whole plant was formerly used to give a redbrown color to the stems of rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus moquianus) for the patterns in the wicker plaques of the Moki Indians of northern Arizona. (W. Hough, 1898; Cat. No. 128708, U.S.N.M.)
Thuja plicata. Giant Cedar.
The split roots of this tree are the common sewing material for the strong, water-tight huckleberry baskets of certain tribes of the Northwest Coast from northern Oregon to British America, including the

<<<Page: 243>>>

Klikitat, Cowlitz, Puyallup, Tulalip, Snoqualmie, Skagit, and Fraser River Indians. The Indians of Neah Bay, Washington, and of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, use the split brown inner bark as the warp of their finely woven but artificially dyed flexible baskets. The Nisqualli Indians of Puget Sound, and doubtless many other tribes of the Northwest coast, employ the same material in coarser strands in making rough burden baskets, frequently in conjunction with a warp of split branches from the same tree. (See Plate 10.)
Tsuga mertensiana. Black Hemlock.
The Indians of Neah Bay, Washington, sometimes use split hemlock roots in their coarse openwork quadrangular V-shaped burden baskets. The tree was described by a Neah Bay Indian as having cones 24 inches long, in which case the species would be the black hemlock instead of the Western hemlock (Zsuga heterophylla), which is the commoner of the two at low elevations in that vicinity.
Tumion californicum. California Nutmeg. K’0’-bi (Pomo).
The split roots of this tree are sometimes used by the Pomo Indians of Mendocino County, California, in the manufacture of their finer baskets. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902.)
Typha latifolia. Cattail. Po/’-pas (Klamath).
Twisted strands made of slender ribbons split from the sheathed portions of the leaves are used by the Klamath Indians of Oregon in their smaller flexible baskets, either to form the body of the basket or to make an ornamental band. The color is a lusterless, slightly ashy white.
Ulmus americana. Elm. The Sioux Indians of the northern plains region used the inner bark of the elm to make a coarse basket. (VW. Haverd, 1890.)
Vaccinium membranaceum. Blueberry. Ka-na-ta’ (Tlinkit).
The juice of some species of blueberry, probably Vaccinium membranaceum, is usedas a purple dye in spruce-root baskets by the Tlinkit Indians of the south Alaskan coast. (G. T. Emmons, notes.)
Vitis californica. } Grape. Shi-in’ (Pomo).
Among the Hupa Indians of northern California the root is sometimes used to fasten the ribs of a basket at its beginning, and to make around at the outer edge of the basket’s bottom, while in fine hats

grape root sometimes makes up the whole weft. (P. E. Goddard, notes. ) Portions of the woody stem are used by the Pomos of Mendocino County, California, as a sewing strand for attaching the rims to their pack baskets. The grape strands completely cover the stout withe that forms the basis for the rim, making it more durable and at the same time thickening it so as to give a good means of firmly grasping the basket. (V. K. Chesnut, 1902, and notes. )
W oodwardia spinulosa. Giant Chain ern.
The Hupa Indians of northern California use a portion of this fern, either white or dyed orange brown with alder bark, in the patterns of their hat baskets. (Mary H. Manning, letter). The parts employed are two slender flat strands, very flexible and leathery when moist, which are extracted from the stalk of the frond.
Xerophyllum tenax. XNerophyllum.
The long, tough, minutely serrated, grass-like, lustrous leaves of this plant, often called squawgrass, are very commonly used by the Indians of the Northwest Coast as an overlaying material to make the white patterns of their baskets. Occasionally it is dyed. The base of the leaf for an inch or more often has a natural faint purple color which is used to good effect. The use of the material extends from the Pit River, Shasta, and Hupa Indians, in northern California, northward through most of the tribes west of the Cascade Range to the Neah Bay and Vancouver Island Indians of the Straits of Fuca. These last two use Xerophyllum leaves, cut to a uniform width by a gauged
knife-edge, as the weft of their gaudily dyed flexible baskets.
Yucca arborescens. Tree Yucca.
The slender roots are sometimes used for red figures in baskets of the Panamint Indians of Inyo County, California.
Yucea arkansana. Yucca.
The leaves are used in the basketry of the Kaiowa Indians of Oklahoma. (J. Mooney, notes.)
Yucca baccata. Banana Yucca.
The Mescalero Apaches of southern New Mexico and adjacent parts of Texas, in the region between the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers, use the split leaves of this plant for the main portion of their baskets, and its roots for the red patterns (Cat. Nos. 204646 to 204653, U.S.N.M.). It is probable, I am informed by Mr. Vernon Bailey, that they use also in the same way the leaves and roots of Yucca macrocarpa, a arborescent species growing at lower elevations in the same region.

<<<Page: 245>>>

Yucca filamentosa. Silkgrass.
The leaves of this plant were formerly in use among the Indians of North Carolina as a basket material. (J. Lawton, 1714.)
Yucca giauca. Plains Yucea. Mo/-hu (Moki).
This plant is used in the basketry of the Moki Indians (W. Hough, 1902) of northern Arizona. In some of the coarser twilled baskets the warp and weft are made up of the narrow unsplit leaves thinned by the removal of a strip from the back. (Cat. No. 218254, U.S.N.M.) In the coiled plaques the sewing material consists of narrow strips split from the leaves. The outer surface of the leaves gives various shades of green and greenish yellow or, in the case of the young leaves, white, or they are dyed in several colors. The dyed strips are often applied with the inner, broken surface outward. This surface takes the dye more readily and gives a deeper shade. For the use of the shredded leaves as a packing material in the first few turns of the spiral, see //ilaria jamesii.
Ill. BASKET MAKING The sallow knows the basket maker’s thumb.—EMERSON,.
Under the head of basket making are included all the activities involved in and fostered by construction, namely:
1. Harvesting materials.—This embraces intimate acquaintance with the places where just the right substances abound, knowledge of the times when each element is ripe, methods of growing, harvesting, and conveying involved, as well as the tools and apparatus used in gathering. In their rough state much of the materials would be as unfit for the use as quarry clay would be for the potter or crude ore for the metallurgist.
2. Preparing materials.—Frequently the raw materials are stored away at the time of harvesting until required for manufacture. Nature makes the rules for gathering in her own good time. But this might be the busy season, whereas this art may go on in different seasons. When the time comes for their use special manipulations are necessary, such as peeling, splitting, making splints, yarning or twisting, twining, braiding, soaking, gauging, coloring. These should each be noted carefully and described for the several basket areas.
3. Processes of manufacture.—The materials being ready, the maker seats herself in the midst and begins the technical operations that should be minutely watched, and photographed, if possible. Collections should also be made of tools, apparatus, and patterns.
Each of these will be examined with minute care, especially the third. If this art is to be imitated and become a stimulus in technical

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. ye aS)
instruction it is of the utmost importance that the substances be correctly known, that the manipulations of material be familiar, and, above all, that the course of each element in the warp and weft, the foundation, and sewing be understood. Care has been taken to draw correctly the figures used in illustration. They are all in the basketry of the Indians, and, more than that, they are the beginnings of more refined processes and structures.
Since the materials used in basketry are derived from different parts of a great variety of plants, the gathering of them involves many industries. The harvesting of basket material is no exception to the rule that every human activity begins with a natural process slightly modified. The birds are in a sense the original basket makers, and it is known that some very expert Indian tribes take the grasses and the stems of plants as they find them. ‘They know nothing of drying or
Fie. 1. MUD SHOES, CALIFORNIA. Klamath Indians. Cat. No. 24109, U.S.N.M. Collected by L. 8. Dyar.
manipulating. Improvement grows out of study into the nature of substances, until with some tribes the obtaining of raw materials involves quite as much sagacity, toil, and travel as the making of the basket.
For procuring the roots, the apparatus of digging is necessary. To be sure, the hand was the first hoe and the strong arm draws the root from its hiding place, but our Indians had gotten beyond that. The northern Indians, especially those of the Columbia River in western Canada, use quite elaborate forms of this device. It is wonderful to think of the sagacity developed in savage minds by the quest for underground substances and the proper discrimination of the places

<<<Page: 247>>>

where the best examples abound. From the farthest north, in the neighborhood of Point Barrow to the southern portions of South America, roots form substantial materials in basket making, both twined and coiled. It is not enough to say simply that roots of plants were the materials of the baskets, but it is well known that the savage women knew in each section what plant furnished the toughest and most pliable roots, the localities in which this kind of root reached its best, the plants that yielded brown, red, and black colored splints, which produced unrivaled effects, though the portion above ground gave no sign of the treasures held or the time of year when it was proper to obtain these substances, and the processes by which they could be extracted and saved most economically. Incidentally to this quest of material, of course, was that of carrying, so that here in the very beginning of our art a host of useful human activities are engendered. The Klamath invented a peculiar kind of mud shoe to wear when wading about in shallow marshes after roots for their basket work. (See fig. 1.)
The stems of plants, of grass, rushes, and woody species are to be found in the basketry of almost every portion of the Western Hemisphere. The young and tough shoots of a single year’s growth are choice materials for some purposes, and were eagerly sought. In those regions where spinous plants yielded the materials, a sort of gathering knife was employed resembling a miniature sickle with a wooden handle. There is atime of year when they are in the best condition for the basket woman’s craft. There are certain parts of the stems which are useful in this direction, while others are valueless. In woody species the outer layer next to the bark has-the toughness of leather, while a little way inward the wood is almost as brittle as glass. Furthermore, the stems of plants vary greatly in color—different parts of the same stem are in different colors.
Now, the student would be surprised to find in the East, in the West, in the North, and in the South that there is very little more for the savage woman to learn. Distinguished botanists will say that instead of trying to teach the Indians the use of new plants, the best way to search for new materials to introduce into modern textile arts can be learned from these savage artisans. The leaves of plants are used in basketry, especially in the South. In the extreme North, among the Eskimo and Athapascan tribes, no leaves are suitable for basketry. Among the Aleutian Islanders stems and leaves of grass come into play. Down the Pacific coast of the continent, in southeastern Alaska, British Columbia, and the coast States of the Union leaves, either in their natural color or dyed, are employed with great effect in many types of ornamentation, as will be seen further on. The range of usefulness, either for texture or ornament, is well known to the basket maker. In Mexico and tropical America this division of the subject

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. ot]
has heen developed most. Little mechanism is necessary in this part of the world. “A sharpened stick for the root gatherer and a flint knife and mussel shell for the stem harvester complete the outfit. Nimble fingers aided with the teeth were the most useful apparatus.
In her textile gleaning, the savage woman has not been slow to avail herself of the metal appliances introduced by the whites. You will now see her afield with pick and knife of steel gathering the oldtime substances.
As is well known, every industry may be divided, either in savagery or in civilization, into four parts: First, that which is associated with taking the gifts of nature, called in this particular instance harvesting; second, the transformation of this material into proper form for special trades; third, the manufacture of useful and ornamental objects; and, finally, the activities of consumption and enjoyment, by which the things may take their places as servants to supply the wants and desires of mankind.
The preparation of materials for basketry consists in splitting and separating the desirable from the undesirable portions; in removing the bark; in taking the soft and spongy matter from the fibrous portion, like soaking and hackling in flax; in making ribbon-like splints of uniform width and thickness; in shredding, as in cedar bark; in twisting, twining, and braiding; in gauging, and coloring.
The apparatus for this intermediate work must have been in aboriginal times very simple, a stone knife and shell for scraping supplementing the work of the fingers and the teeth. The quality of the finished workmanship depends largely upon this secondary process. In those regions of very uniform moisture the plants used were of quick growth and pliable, and it would be easy, even without metal tools, to secure fine splints and other elements in the manufacture; but in those localities where the raw substances were more brittle, fine work would be difficult and indeed was impossible until quite recently. It is a question, therefore, whether anciently some of the modern processes in basketry were known at all. Certainly there was no such delicate basketry made in Canada by the untaught aborigines as can now be procured from their descendants; but in the old graves of California and the adjoining areas wonderful pieces of delicate workmanship are brought from ancient pre-Columbian tombs.
It must not be forgotten that coloring matters were in ancient times among the prepared materials of basketry. Nature furnishes opportunities for diversity of color in the substances themselves. The Indian also knew how to change or modify the natural color of different materials by burying them in mud. The juices of the plants and the mineral substances in the mud combined to produce darker shades of

<<<Page: 249>>>

the same color or an entirely different one. But the savage woman had gone further, for they well knew that certain plants were useful as dyes. In point of fact, the best dyestuffs of each area had been exhaustively exploited. <A list of these for each area would include a large number of useful plants. As in gathering materials the simplest processes involve slight artificiality, so in this intermediary art the most primitive basket makers modified little their raw materials. They did not store them away for the convenient season, and, save that they soaked them before using, practiced none of the refining processes necessary to the highest results.
In each of the culture areas of America the metheds of preparing materials were peculiar.
Dr. Walter J. Hoffman “ described in 1895 the aboriginal process of preparing material for wicker baskets among the Menomini Indians (Algonquin Family) on Lake Michigan. See figures 110 to 114 of this paper.
A small log of wood, 3 or 4 inches in diameter and as long as it is possible to procure one without knots, furnishes the splints. (Hoffman’s fig. 37.) These logs are cut when the rings of annual growth are most easily ruptured. The log is beaten with a wooden mallet. The example shown in Hoffman’s illustration (fig. 38) is of modern type, made with steel tools, but the ancient Indian, no doubt, had a much rougher but quite as efficient implement. The strips thus loosened are torn off one by one as long as the material is sufficiently flexible for basket making. The next process is the shaping of these splints for the desired work—splitting them, shaving them down thin and smooth, and finishing them for the hand of the weaver.
The basket-maker’s awl of bone, the old aboriginal implement, may be seen at work in many camps; but the knife with which the preColumbian woman cut her basket material has utterly disappeared from use. Now, among the Algonkin, the knife of steel vastly improved their art and it raises a question whether in the pristine condition of savagery some forms of basketry were as good as they are at present. This query applies only to work done in hard wood.
The knife now in use among the Indians for this and other woodworking purposes is an interesting survival fromthe remote past in Europe. It is now active in the farrier’s shop for paring the frog of the horse’s foot, prior to putting on the shoe; but two or three centuries ago, under name of man’s knife,’ it found its way through the entire English and French area of North America.
A curved blade of steel is inserted or laid in a groove on the side of

the handle, made fast by wrapping with strong twine. The groove is shouldered so as to take the pressure. The blade is detachable for the purpose of grinding it. It will be seen that if held in the right hand the operator cuts toward himself. This is the ancient method of whittling practiced by the peoples on the western shores of the Pacific Ocean, the Ainos, Japanese, etc. (Hotfman’s fig. 39.)
A bundle of splints is shown in fig. 40 of Hoffman’s paper of different widths ready for the hand of the basket maker, and in fig. 41 (Hoffman) is a coarse-finished product showing the method of setting up the warp and applying the weft in wicker basketry of the Menomini.
It is not known that the ancient Menomini used any dyes on their baskets whatever. In their modern ware they procure these substances through traders.
The sweet grass (Savastana odorata), of which large quantities of baskets are manufactured, was dried in the shade to hold its color. Further, it was rolled into bunches and sewed with sinew, as the Eskimo do in making their coiled baskets. Very old specimens of such ware are preseryed in collections. But in the ware now in the market twine and braid of this material are prepared beforehand in large quantities for the future use of the weaver and frequently by different hands.
Farther south in the Eastern basket area the canes for twilled basketry needed no knife for the splitting. A slight blow would crush the stalk, the spongy matter adhering to the inside was scraped away, and the splints were ready for the dyer or the weaver if they were not to be colored,
The following information concerning natural sources of color for basketry and other objects among the Cherokee Indians comes from Miss Harriet C. Wilkie, of Raleigh, North Carolina. The petals of the iris rubbed ona slightly rough surface are said to yield a rich and lasting purple. ‘The blossoms and tender green tops and leaves of the common sneeze weed (//Zelendum autumnale) made into a tea yield a beautiful and fadeless yellow. Long boiling dulls this to a yellowish olive. The common broom sedge (Andropogon scoparius), winter dried, yields another yellow, less pure and brilliant, also much affected by continued boiling. The color is known as burnt orange and works beautifully in basketry.
In central Alaska the Athapascan tribes use both spruce and willow for their coiled basket jars and trinket material. Much care is bestowed in splitting the roots and stems, in order to procure uniform sewing material. In the U.S. National Museum the specimens all show care in this regard. The Alaskan Eskimo on Bering Sea also manufacture coiled basketry as well as twined, but it is from dried grass and shows very little care in the preparation. Crossing over to the Aleutian chain, the care bestowed on materials is different.

<<<Page: 251>>>

When Attu weavers wanted the grass to be white it was cut in November, the whole stalk (wild rye), and hung points down out of doors to dry. If grass was to be yellow, the common color, it is cut in the middle of July, and the two youngest blades that are full grown are then cut out and split into three pieces, the middle one being thrown away. The other pieces are then tied into bunches about 2 inches in diameter and hung up to dry out of doors (points down). If the grass is to be cured green it is prepared as when it is wanted to be yellow, but the first two weeks of the curing is carried on in the shade of the dense growth of grass and weeds that is found in the villages. After that it is taken out and dried in the house. Under no circumstances is the sun allowed to shine on any of the grass in the process of curing, which takes about a month or more.
Beautiful coiled basketry is made by the Chilcotin, Harrison Lake, Lower Thompson Indians in British Columbia, Salish on the coast, as well as Klikitat and Tulalip in Washington. Only women and girls occupy themselves with this work. The baskets are made from the small, trailing roots of the cedar (Thuja plicata). These are dug up with an ordinary root digger, and pieces of the desired length and of about the thickness of a finger are cut off. These are buried in the ground to keep them fresh. When required they are taken out and peeled or scraped with a sharp stone or knife. They are then hung up until dry enough for use. Next they are split into long strips by inserting and pressing forward the point of the awl used in basket making, made from the long bone of a deer. The pieces which have the desired width and thickness throughout their entire length are used for stitching purposes, while others which split irregularly, or are too short or too thin to be used for that purpose, are put together in bundles to form the foundation of the coils. In the sewing these foundations are kept continuous and of uniform thickness by adding fresh pieces as required. (See Plate 11.)
In other basketry, thin, pliable strips of cedar sap or other wood in pairs, having both smooth sides out, are used for foundation instead of the bunches of split roots. These are stitched in the same manner, but are neither as strong nor as durable nor are they water-tight.¢
The Upper Fraser and the Lytton bands sometimes use “/ymus triticoides instead of Xerophyllum. The bark used is that of Prunus demissa, Which is either left its natural light reddish-brown color or is dyed by burying it in damp earth. By thus keeping it under ground for a short time it assumes a dark-brown color; if kept longer it becomes quite black. (Teit.)
The Makah Indians make a red color by mixing vermilion with chewed salmon eggs; black color is a combination of bituminous coal

and the same carrier; cedar bark is colored black by soaking in mud, and red by means of alder bark chewed. (Swan.)
The Twana Indians, on Skokomish Reservation, Washineton, now use a steel-bladed knife and an awl of the same material in basket making. Formerly they employed a pointed stick or bone for their imbricated ware and for pressing home the weft of twined basketry; but in large measure their fingers are their tools. (Myron Eells.) The same remark applies to basket makers in all the culture areas. Fingers and teeth are still in vogue and can not be dispensed with. The metal awl, however, quite displaces that of bone, and it is not surprising to find scissors of the best make added to the steel-bladed knife, especially for clipping off the projecting ends of materials.
Hazel stalks are gathered by Oregon tribes in best form on ground that has been burned over, the young ones springing up straight and strong from the rich soil. The peeled stems are the warp, those split by means of the teeth are the weft, and a dye is made from the bark chewed by the basket maker. (Mrs. Harriet K. McArthur.) The tine white grass, like ivory in smoothness and tint, is obtained at great elevations, their excursions leading them to the summer snow line of Mount Shasta.
As you gaze on the Indian basket maker at work, herself frequently unkempt, her garments the coarsest, her house and surroundings suggestive of anything but beauty, you are amazed. You look about you, as in a cabinet shop or atelier, for models, drawings, patterns, pretty bits of color effect. There are none. Her patterns are in her soul, in her memory and imagination, in the mountains, water courses, lakes, and forests, and in those tribal tales and myths which dominate the actions of every hour. She hears suggestions from another world. Her tools are more disappointing still, for of these there are few—a rude knife, a pointed bone, that is all. Her modeling block is herself. Her plastic body is the repository of forms. Over her knee she molds depressions in her ware, and her lap is equal to all emergencies for convex effects. She herself is the Vishnu of her art, the creator of forms.
The Tlinkit in weaving, says Emmons, sits with the knees drawn up to the chin, the feet close to the body, the shoulders bent over, the arms around the knees, the hands in front. Sometimes one knee is dropped a little to the side, and, in the case of old women, they often recline on one hip, with the legs drawn up, the elbows resting on a pillow or blanket doubled up.
In all types of weave the working strands are constantly dampened by dipping the fingers into a basket or cup of water close at hand, or, in the case of embroidery, by drawing the section of grass stem

<<<Page: 253>>>

through the lips. The material is kept in a plaque-like work basket called tarlth (‘‘spread out,” from its flat bottom and low, flaring sides). Besides the shell or metal knife there is generally a rude awl, consisting of a spike of goat or deer horn, a bear’s claw, or a piece of bone rubbed down to a tapering point, and a large incisor of the brown bear or the tooth of the killer whale. These constitute all of the tools and accessories used in basketry. (Emmons.)
Plate 12 represents a Pomo Indian basketmaker. In front of her is an unfinished water-tight basket jar in plain twined weaving. The warp elements are willow rods dressed down to uniform thickness; the weft is of carex root and cercis stems split, the patterns being made in the latter. Photographed by H. W. Henshaw.
Plate 13 represents a Tlinkit woman of Sitka, Alaska, making a twined basket. All the native surroundings are absent—the environment, as men are wont to say—but the artist’s mind and skillful fingers remain. She has four elements to handle simultaneously— warp, two wefts, and decorative material. The mouth, therefore, is brought into requisition, as may be seen. The operation consists in twining with finely divided spruce root and wrapping each outside splint with colored straw. The work resembles embroidery When finished and is,.in this work, called false embroidery.
There seems to be always an affectionate fellow feeling between the skillful hand of the artisan and the materials which it fashions. The more tractable the latter, the more deft the former. That is not always true in culture. The best endowment does not always yield the best results. But the statement holds good in our art with few exceptions. Where the finest grasses grow, and the toughest roots and stems, they set up a school of mutual refinement between the woman and her work. It needs only a few miles eastward or northward to change the garden into a desert and correspondingly to degenerate the artist. It would be unjust to her ingenious mind to overlook the fact that she has not been utterly cast down by the failure of one kind of material.. She is not long in finding out new substances and new technic processes for each environment.
The various processes of manufacture will now be definitely explained. In technic, as already said (p. 190), basketry is either handwoven or sewed. The hand-woven basketry is further divisible into (A) Checkerwork, (B) Twilledwork, (C) Wickerwork, (D) Wrappedwork, and (E) Zieinedwork, in several varieties. The sewed work goes by the name of coiled basketry, and is classed both by the foundation and the fastening. In addition to these technical methods on the body, special ones are to be found in the border.

A. Checkerwork.—This occurs especially in the bottoms of many North Pacific coast examples, and also in the work of eastern Canadian tribes (fig. 2); in matting its use is well nigh universal.
In this ware the warp and the weft have the same thickness and pliability. 1t is impossible, therefore, in looking at the bottoms of the cedar-bark baskets and the matting of British Columbia (fig. 3) or Eastern Canada to tell which is warp and which is weft. In very many examples the warp and weft of a checker bottom are turned up at right angles to form the warp of the sides, which may be wicker or twined work. A great deal of bark matting is made in this same checkerwork, but the patterns run obliquely to the axis of the fabric, giving the appearance of diagonal weaving. The fine hats of Ecuador are especially noticeable in this deceptive appearance, which is caused by the weaver’s beginning the work at the center. Perhaps, though there is no positive information on this subject, the North Pacific coast women proceed in the same manner to give a tiled effect to the surface of their matting. When warp and weft are fine yarn or threads the result is the simplest form of cloth in cotton, linen, pina fiber, or wool. The cheap fab-

being left whole for artificial effects. At proper intervals broader strips of weft are introduced. In the chapter on ornamentation attention will be called to the variety in this mass of unity by the individual characteristics of each square in the weaving.
B. Twilledwork.—This is seen especially in those parts of the world where cane abounds. In America it is quite common in British Columbia, Washington, Southern United States, Mexico, and Central America, and of excellent workmanship in Peru, Guiana, and Ecuador. The fundamental technic of diagonal basketry is in passing each element of the weft over two or more warp elements, thus producing either diagonal or twilled, or,
Fic. 4. in the best samples, an endless variety of EA OS: diaper patterns. (See figs. 5 and 6.)
The example shown in Plate 15 represents a cigar case made by the women of Bolivia, who weave the celebrated Panama hats, the texture being fine twilled work. The ornamentation should be studied care-fully, for it consists of twined weaving, in which both warp and weft strands are brought together in pairs and one twined about the other.

the weft threads to pass over one warp thread, and then under two, and so on, instead of taking the warp threads in regular succession, one ot, one up. The next weft thread takes a set oblique to the former, throwing up one of the two deposed by the preceding. In some twills it is one in three, or one in four. The Latin fr7777, a certain pattern in weaving, became dri//ich in German, and hence our word drill. Twill is derived from zwilJich, which answers to the Latin d777r, and the Greek dimitos. The latter survives in d/imn/ty. See also sate, derived from Greek heramiton, six thread.

thread of weft is flushed, or separated from the warp while passing over a number of warp threads, and then passes under a warp thread. (See Plate 16.)
The points where the threads of the warp cross form diagonal lines,

parallel to each other, across the face of the cloth. In blanket twill every third thread is crossed. In some fabrics 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 threads are crossed. In full satin twill there is an interval of 15 threads, the warp (organzine silk) being floated over 15 threads of the woof (tram), giving the glossy appearance.
Twills require heddles equal in number to the threads that are included in the intervals between the intersections. This disposition of the warps in the heddles is termed mounting the loom, and the

heddles are termed /eaves. A twill takes its name from the number of leaves employed, as a three-leaf twill, a five-leaf twill, ete.
Twills are used for the display of color, for strength, variety, thickness, or durability.
On a fragment of ancient pottery from Alabama, Holmes also discovered marks of basketry in twilled weaving, as shown in fig. 7.
It will be noticed that material of cat-tail or split cane was used. The effect shown in the figure was produced by passing each weft strand over three warp strands and under one on the side exhibited. On the other side of the texture, no doubt, the process was reversed,

the warp strands passing over three and under one. In such work there was opportunity to use double warp and weft, the strips of cane laid together so as to expose two bright surfaces.
In order to vary the texture of twilled work, the ancient inhabitants of the Mississippi Valley knew how to use for warp and weft substances of different widths. On a fragment of ancient pottery from Pope County, Tennessee, Holmes found impressions of ancient basketry. Fig. 8 shows how these ancient weavers utilized wide fiber of bast or split cane for the warp, and string for the weft, passing in their work over two each time. For the uses of woven fabrics on making pottery

and the interesting way in which the history of lost arts have been preserved, see Part VII.
Excellent variety was also produced in this kind of weaving by means of color. Almost any textile plant when split has two colors, that of the outer, or bark surface, and that of the interior woody surface or pith. Also the different plants used in diagonal basketry have great variety of color. By the skillful manipulation of the two sides of a splint, by using plants of different species, or with dyed elements, geometric patterns, frets, labyrinths, and other designs in straight line are possible. (See fig. 9.)

<<<Page: 259>>>

Examples from the saltpeter caves, and modern pieces from the Cherokee, both in matting and basketry, are double. By this means both the inside and the outside of the texture expose the glossy siliceous surface of the cane. By changing the number of warp splints or a stem over which the weft passes, it will be seen in the figure here given that great variety of diaper or damask effect may be produced.
C. Wicherwork.—The name is from the Anglo-Saxon wican, to bend. Common in eastern Canada, it is little known on the Pacific coast and in the Interior Basin, excepting in one or two pueblos, but is seen abundantly in southern Mexico and Central America. It consists of a wide or a thick and inflexible warp and a slender flexible weft (fig. 10). The weaving is plain and differs from checkerwork only in the fact that one of the elements is rigid. The effect on the surface is a series of ridges. It is possible also to produce diagonal effects in this type of weaving.
Wickerwork must have been a very early and primitive form of textile. Weirs for stopping fish are made of brush, and wattled ; fences for game drivers are set up in the same manner. <A great deal of the coarse basketry in use for packing and transporting is made in this fashion. The Zuni Indians make gathering baskets of little twigs after the same technic, the inflexible warp being made up of a small number of twigs of the same plant, laid side by side. ‘The transition from checker to wicker in some examples is easy. ‘The moment one element, either warp or weft, is a

The finest specimens in America are the very pretty Hopi plaques made of Chrysothamnus moquianus and C.laricinus. Short stems are dyed in various colors for weft, the ends worked into the warp and the whole driven tightly home, so as to hide the ends of the warp and even the manner of weaving. (See fig. 11.)
Various patterns are effected on the surface—geometric figures, clouds, mythical animals and persons, and symbols connected with worship. Wickerwork has pleasing effects combined with diagonal and other work. Fig. 12 is a square Hopi plaque, having twilled weaving in the middle and a band of wicker outside of this, the whole finished with rough, coiled sewing on the border.
It has passed into modern industry through the cultivation of osiers, rattan, and such plants for market baskets, covers for glass bottles,

For commercial purposes, wicker baskets precisely like those of the Abenaki Indians are thus made.
The white-oak timber is brought to the yard in sticks running from 6 to 40 inches in diameter and from 4 to 18 feet lone. It is first sawed into convenient lengths, then split with a maul and wedges into fourths or sixteenths. The bark is then stripped off with a drawing knife. The next process is cutting it into bolts at what is called the splitting horse, to be shaved down with a drawing knife into perfectly smooth, even bolts of the width and length desired. These are then placed in

the steam box and steamed for a half hour or so, which makes the splints more pliable. They are taken thence to the splint knife, which is arranged so that one person, by changing the position of the knife, can make splints of any desired thickness, from that of paper to that of a three-fourths-inch hoop.
The oyster baskets and most small baskets have the bottom splints laid one across another and are plainly woven in checker.
But the round-bottomed baskets, used for grain and truck, are made by taking from 10 to 18 ribs and laying them across each other at the middle, in radiating form, and weaving around with a narrow thin splint until the desired size for the bottom is reached, when the splints are turned up and set in other baskets, about a dozen in a series, for twenty-four hours.

<<<Page: 261>>>

They are then woven around with a fine splint and placed on a revolving drum or form and filled up the required hight and set in the sun to dry for six hours. They are then shaken hard by striking the bottom on the floor, which causes the splints to settle tight together and prepared for the rim. They next proceed to fasten the handles to the sides and put the rims or hoops on by fitting them into the notches made in the handles and binding them tightly with fine splints. The different styles are made by using different-shaped drums and variously colored splints, the latter being done by dipping the splints before weaving into dyes.
The most curiously made baskets are those for the charcoal and eelpots.
The charcoal baskets are =SSc= shaped like a tray and are car-

nic are to be seen in America at the present time among the Indians of southern Arizona for their carrying frames. (See fig. 13.)
The warp extends from the rigid hoop, which forms the top, to the bottom where the elements are made fast. Firmness is given to the structure by means of two bowed rods crossing at right angles at the bottom and securely lashed at the top. The weft, usually of twine, is attached to one of the corner or frame pieces at the bottom and is wrapped once around each warp element. This process continues ina coil until the top of the basket is reached. In some of its features this method resembles coiled work, but as a regular warp is employed and no needle is used in the coiling, it belongs more to the woven series. Hudson mentions the same among the Pomos for holding roof

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. wou
poles in place. The wrapping is very close where the rafters come to a point. As they widen the weft comes to be farther apart, being quite open on the outer margin. This method of weaving was employed by the mound builders of the Mississippi Valley. Markings of wrapped weaving pressed on ancient pottery taken from a mound in Ohio are to be seen in the Third Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. (See fig. 14.)
This style of weaving had not a wide distribution in America and is used at the present day in a restricted region. When the warp and the weft are of the same twine or material and the decussations are drawn tight, the joint resembles the first half of a square knot. The Mincopies of the Andaman Islands construct a carrying basket in the same technic. Specimens of their work were collected and presented to the U. 8. National Museum by Dr. W. L. Abbott.¢ These baskets resemble most closely the Mohave specimens, only they are smaller and more attractive. The Mincopies and their neighbors far and near have the incomparable rattan for warp and weft, which combines the strength and flexibility of copper wire. The distribution of this wrapped weav-
ing has not been studied. Plate 17 — wearrep weayine, rRom MouND IN onto. is a carrying basket in wrapped sage eee a a
weaving from the Mohave Indians, photographed from the original now in the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago.
E. Tiinediwork.—This is found in ancient mounds of the Mississippi Valley, in bagging of the Rocky Mountains, down the Pacific coast from the island of Attu, the most westerly of the Aleutian chain, to the borders of Chile, and here and there in the Atlantic slope of South America. Indeed, it is found among savages throughout the world. It is the most elegant and intricate of all in the woven or plicated series. Twined work has a set of warp rods or rigid elements as in wickerwork, but the weft elements are commonly administered in pairs, though in three-strand twining and in braid twining three weft elements are employed. In passing from warp to warp these elements are twisted in half-turns on each other so as to form a two-strand or three-strand twine or braid and usually so deftly as to keep the smooth, glossy side of the weft outward.
The position of the weaver at her task on twined work, in Plate 18, shows the transition between the humble posture of the primitive basket maker and her successor later on seated at a loom. The name

of the weaver in the lower figure is Elizabeth Propokoffono. Her home is on the island of Atka, far out in the Aleutian chain. The Tlinkit weaver sits on the ground in the old-fashioned way, because her warp is rigid and self-supporting; Elizabeth, however, is working in soft grass, both for warp and weft. For this reason the former is suspended, and she is working from below upward. The Haida Indians on Queen Charlotte Archipelago south of her, as will be seen later on, weave in the same manner, the warp resting on a disk fastened to the top of a stake. Enough of modern technical appliances are mingled with this thoroughly aboriginal process to mark a sharp contrast between the woman’s fingers and her beautiful basket on the one hand, and her loom-woven clothing, her flatiron, and the iron hinges on her door rei aC saan on the other hand.

Fig. 15. PLAIN TWINED WEAVING.
1. Plain twined weaving over single warps.
2. Diagonal twined weaving or twill over two or more warps.
3. Wrapped twined weaving, or bird-cage twine, in which one weft element remains rigid and the other is wrapped about the crossings.
4. Lattice-twined weaving, tee or Hudson stitch, twined work around vertical warps crossed by horizontal warp element.
Three-strand twined weaving and braiding in several styles.
1. Plain twined weaving.—Plain twined weaving is a refined sort of wattling or crating. The ancient engineers, who built obstructions in streams to aid in catching or impounding fish, drove a row of sticks into the bottom of the stream, a few inches apart. Vines and brush were woven upon these upright sticks which served for a warp. In passing each stake the two vines or pieces of brush made a half turn on each other. This is a very primitive mode of weaving. Plain twined basketry is made on exactly the same plan. There is a set of warp elements which may be reeds, or splints, or string, arranged radially on the bottom and parallel on the body. The weft consists
“Thirteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1896, Plate 1.

<<<Page: 264>>>

of two strips of root or other flexible material, and these are twisted as in forming a two-strand rope passing over a warp stem at each halfturn. (See fig. 15.) Many wastebaskets are woven on this plan.
Plate 19 shows two bowls in plain twined weaving, called Bamtush by the Pomos, which are excellent examples of the possibilities and limitations of this style. ‘They are in the collection of C. P. Wileomb, of San Francisco. The upper figure, 10 inches in diameter, is from Cloverdale, Russian River, Sonoma County; the lower from Potter Valley, in Mendocino County. The warp is of willow rods, the weft of carex root and splints of cercis. A small space at the bottom is in threeply braid and the narrow band near the top, with wide twists, is plain twined work over more than one warp stem. (See Plates 34, 44, 71, 72.)
In this connection must not be overlooked a variety of twined weaving in which the warp plays an important part. It is a transition between the plain twine and the next

the strain of weaving, they will assume a zigzag shape.
Pleasing varieties of this type of twined weaving will be found in the Aleutian Islands. (See fig. 16.) It resembles hemstitching. The Aleuts frequently use for their warp stems of wild rye or other grasses, in which the straws are split, or a pair used, and the two halves pass upward in zigzag form. Each half of a warp is caught alternately with the other half of the same straw and with a half of the adjoining straw, making a series of triangular instead of rectangular spaces. (See fig. 17.)
A still further variation is given to plain twined ware by crossing

<<<Page: 265>>>

the warps. In bamboo basketry of eastern Asia these crossed warps are also interlaced or held together by a horizontal strip of bamboo passing in and out in ordinary weaving. In such examples the interstices are triangular, but in the twined example here described the weaving passes across between the points where the warps intersect

each other, leaving hexagonal interstices. (See fig. 18 and Plate 166.) This combination of plain twined weft and crossed warp has not a wide distribution in America, but examples are to be seen in southeastern Alaska and among relics found in Peruvian graves.
2. Diagonal twined weaving.—In diagonal twined weaving the twisting of the weft filaments is precisely the same as In plain twined weaving. The difference of the texture is caused by the manner in which the weft crosses the warps. This style abounds among the Ute Indians and the Apache, who dip the bottles made in this fashion into pitch and thus produce a water-tight vessel, the open meshes receiying the pitch more freely. The technic of il the diagonal weaving consists in passing
BEE over two or more warp elements at each te ee ae ag turn, just as in weaving with a single element. But the warp of the diagonal twined weaving never passes over or under more than one weft as it does in twilled weaving. There must be an odd number of warps, for in the next round the same pairs are not included in the half turns. The ridges on the outside, therefore, are not vertical as in plain weaving, but pass diagonally over the surface, hence the name. (See Plate 20, and figs. 19 and 20.)
Ute Indians, Utah.

Plate 20 will make clear the difference between plain twined weaying and diagonal twined or twilled work. The figures are of the burden basket, the granary, and the mush bowls of the Pomo Indians, in Lake, Sonoma, and Mendocino counties, California, in the collection of C. P. Wileomb. Especial attention is here drawn to the infinitely greater possibilities of decoration in the twilled work. ‘The foregoing plate shows that the ornamentation of plain twined basketry is confined chiefly to bands, : =i ee but here the artist revels in the eycloid, man = ( itis (o—

On the outside of the basket the turns of the wrapping are oblique;

on the inside they are vertical. It will be seen on examining’ this fig-
ure that one row inclines to the right, the one above it to the left, and so on alternately. This was occasioned by the weaver’s passing from side to side of the square carrying basket, and not all the way round as usual. The work is similar to that in an old-fashioned bird cage, where the upright and horizontal wires are held in place by a wrapping of finer soft wire. The

bird-cage twine is to be seen among the Makah Indians of the Wakashan family living about Neah Bay, Washington, and in the soft hats of Salish and Shapaptian. (See fig. 22.)
In this type the warp and the horizontal strip behind the warp are both in soft material. The wrapping is done with a tough strawcolored grass. When the weaving is beaten home tight the surface is not unlike that of a fine tiled roof, the stitches overlying each other

with perfect regularity. Such a simple style of fastening warp and weft together would seem to have occurred to tribes of savages in many parts of the world. Strange to relate, however, excepting In Washington and the ocean side of Vancouver Island, the process 1s not known. The exception to this statement is to be found in a few spo‘adic cases where, perhaps, Nutka and Makah women had married into adjoining tribes. A few of the Salish women make similar ware, and it will be seen in basket hats of thé Nez Percé Indians. A smali colie. lection of this ware came to the
iP Museum through the Wilkes ha-
f) ploring Expedition, but the orna\ vi (| | mentation 1s decidedly Skokomish. Figs. 23 and 24 show the detail of mixed twined weaving, diagonal twined weaving, and wrapped v/ twined weaving, inside and outside view. The facility with which the basket maker combines these weaves in the same texture gives her complete control over her material in the matter of ornamentation. The coloring of the two sides of the splints of cercis shows, in the figures, the difference between the outside and the inside of the basket. Another element of technic, not mentioned hitherto, is made apparent here in the requirements of these three different styles of workmanship controlling the space somewhat of the warp rods. Perhaps in no other tribe than the Pomo is there such free use of any number of textile methods on the same piece of workmanship to secure different results.
It is possible to combine the several methods of twined weaving and, calling the aid of cclor, to produce good effects even in unpromising materials. Figs. 25 and 26 show back and front of a square from a Ute basket jar. The first two rows are plain twined work, then come three rows of plain twined work also, though it does not look like it. It incloses warp stems in pairs, and the back and front are alike. It changes to diagonal merely by alternating warps. Below these three rows are diagonal twine, wrapped twine, or Makah weave, combined with diagonal. Plate 21 contains five figures, all in diagonal twined weaving. They were made by the Ute Indians and collected long ago by Major J. W. Powell. They represent first of all the different results of the same technical process in varied materials. The specimens are all woven precisely alike. Fig. 1 has a coarse, inflexible warp. Fig. 2 has a finer warp, and hence the twists may be driven closer home. Fig. 4 shows the adaptation of modern shape in facili-

tating the carrying. In fig. 5 a fine weft assumes a diagonal shape in being twisted, while fig. 3 is the last word in the story of the water jar.
4. Lattice-twined weaving.—The lattice-twined weaving, so far as the collections of the National Museum show, is contined to the Pomo Indians, of the Kulanapan family, residing on Russian River, California. It is so called because it has a vertical and a horizontal warp

resembling latticework. Dr. J. W. Hudson calls this technic tee. This is a short and convenient word, and may be used for a specific name. The tee-twined weaving consists of four elements, (~) the upright warp of rods, (4) a horizontal warp crossing these at right angles, and (¢, 7) a regular plain-twined weaving of two elements, holding the warps firmly together. (See fig. 27.)
In all these examples in the National Museum the horizontal or extra warp is on the exterior of the basket. On the outside the tee

basket does not resemble the ordinary twined work, but on the inside it is indistinguishable. Baskets made in this fashion are very rigid and strong, and frequently the hoppers of mills for grinding acorns, and also water-tight jars, are thus constructed. The ornamentation is contined to narrow bands, the artist being restricted by the technic.

in turn passed behind three warp elements. After that the process is repeated. By referring to the lower halves of figs. 28 and 29, the outside and the inside of this technic will be made plain. On the outside there is the appearance of a three-strand string laid along the warp stems, while on the inside the texture looks like a plain twined weaving.

<<<Page: 271>>>

The reason for this is apparent, since in every third revolution one element passes behind the warp and two remain in front. Threestrand twined work is seldom used over the entire surface of a basket. In fig. 30 will be seen the drawing of a very old piece of twined work from the ancient Hopi or Moki Pueblo. The bottom of this old basket jar and a portion of the body, as will be seen, are covered with plain twine weft. The shoulder and neck and two bands of the body are in three-strand twined weaving. A small portion of the inside, seen in the top of the’drawing, as will be seen, has the appearance of small twostrand twined work. In fig. 31 is shown a square inch from the sur-

face of this jar, enlarged to make plain, the appearance of the two types of technic. The upper portion of the figure has all the appearance of twilled and twined work in two-strand weft. The three-strand work shown in this figure isa Ute motive. The U.S. National Museum collections represent at least seven different styles of basketry technic attributed to the Hopi people of Tusayan, and philologists have come to the conclusion that the Hopi are a very mixed people.
(b) Three-strand braid.—In three-strand braid the weft elements are held in the hand in the same fashion, but instead of being twined simply they are plaited or braided, and as each element passes under

<<<Page: 272>>>

one and over the other of the remaining two elements, it is carried behind a warp stem. This process is better understood by examining the upper part of fig. 32, @and 6. On the surface, when the work is driven home, it is impossible to discriminate between three-strand twine and three-strand braid. The three-strand braid is found at the starting of all Pomo twined baskets, no Eiastee how the rest is built up. VA gp he Eg Fig. 33 isa conical carrying basket PE. BZ of the Klamath Indians of Oregon, Go, Z ae collected by L. 8. Dyar. It is made of coarse stems of rushes. The warp begins with a few stems brought together to a point at the bottom and as the specimen widens out fresh warp stems are added. These are securely joined together by a continuous coil of weft, which is a three-strand braid. At the beginning these turns of the coil touch one another, but as the work proeresses and the basket widens the distance from one row to the next increases until they are nearly an inch apart at the top. The braiding is done from the outside, two of the stems showing always there and only one on the inside, resembling common twined weaving. This is the only specimen in the Museum in which the whole surface is braided. In many twined baskets of the
a, outside; b, inside.
Pomo an inch or so at the bottom is thus woven. The top is finished off in the following manner: Three warp ends are braided together for at least 2 inches, turned down and cut off. The hook-shaped ends are held in place by a row of common twined weaving at the top. Just below this and close to the ends is a row of three-strand braid.

<<<Page: 273>>>

Another row of the same kind is made halfway between the upper edge of the solid weaving and the border. A hoop of wood is held in place on the inside by a wrapping of coarse twine. The appearance of three-strand braid in the drawing on the inside of the basket is given by the strands of twined weaving and the ends of the warp bent over. The basket is strengthened on the outside by five vertical rods, and the carrying string is in three-strand braid, precisely as in the body and margin of the basket. Height 22 inches, diameter 23 inches. In the collection of Dr. C. Hart Merriam are two closely woven Klamath baskets in the same technic (see Plate 174). Styles (c) and (d@) belong rather to ornamentation and will be described under that heading.

Something should be said in this connection about the manner of laying the foundation for weaving baskets. In many of the specimens illustrated in this work it will be seen that very little tasteful care has been bestowed upon this part of the work. The Eskimos, for instance, do not know how, seemingly, but use a piece of rawhide, and it is said that the Indians of British Columbia formerly inserted a piece of board or wood at the bottom of their coiled baskets and sewed the coils around an edge of it, but there is method in much of the basket weaving in this point, as will be seen on examining the plates.

exactly the manner in which this is done. Fig. 36 shows another method of beginning with 16 warp stems, plaiting them into checker pattern at first,

Coiled basketry is produced by an over-and-over sewing with some kind of flexible material, each stitch interlocking with the one immediately underneath it. The exception to this is to be seen on Salish, Maidu, and other baskets, in which the passing stitch is driven through the wood of the one underneath and splits it.
In the coiled basketry of British Columbia, as well as here and there farther south, this splitting of stitches, so clumsy looking when done without plan, is turned into an element of beauty. The top of
ach stitch is carefully bifurcated or trifurcated, so that to the uninitiated the sew-

The specimen (Plate 23) is a remarkable old piece found near Death’s Valley, California. Diameter, 63 inches; depth, 4 inches; colors, dark wood, with line of brown around top. This is one of the finest specimens of furcated stitches. It resembles common Ute basketry of the two-stem variety, and in the sewing the stitches are not driven home tight, but left as wide apart as possible. On the inside

of the basket it is plain coiled sewing, showing the foundation rod clearly between the stitches. Passing the awl point between the stitches on the inside, it is carefully pushed through so as to divide the sewing splint of the previous coil exactly in the middle. This gives the appearance of embroidery stitches from the center of the bottom to the outer margin. This specimen of furcated stitching is in the collection of Edward L. MeLeod. Those familiar with the coiled basket making taught in the industrial schools will compare this work with their own, in which the colored rafia is hidden in the foundation for a space of wrapping and comes out at the point where the double stitch is to be made.
The transition between lace work and coiled basketry is interesting. In the netted bags of pita fiber, common throughout middle America, in the muskemoots or Indian bags of fine caribou skin thong from the Mackenzie River district, as well as in the lace-like netting of the Mohave carrying frames and Peruvian textiles, the sewing and interlocking constitute the whole texture, the woman doing her work over a short cylinder or spreader of wood or bone, which she moves along as she works. When the plain sewing changes to half hitches, or stitches in which the moving part of the filament or twine is wrapped or served one or more times about itself, there is the rude beginning of point lace work. This is seen in basketry and soft wallets of the Mackenzie River tribes, the Hopewell mound relics in Ohio, here and there in California, and especially among the Fuegians, as well as in many pieces from various parts of the Old World. (See figs. 59, 115).
The sewing materials vary with the region. In the Aleutian Islands it is of delicate straw; in the adjacent region it is spruce root; in British Columbia it is cedar or spruce root; in the more diversified styles of the Pacific States every available material Fig. 40. has been used—stripped leaf, grass stems, rushes, "0%* 20" TOR COmeD split root, broad fillets, and twine, the effect of each Collected by Edward being well marked. The gathering and preparation aia of these materials for use have already been described in the first portion of this paper. It is understood that, as in woven basketry, the grasses, roots, and splints of wood are soaked in water and kept as pliable as possible until the work is done.
In all coiled basketry, properly so called, there is a foundation more
Snr EERE

<<<Page: 277>>>

or less rigid, inclosed within stitches, the only implement being an awl of some kind. Fig. 40 shows the metatarsal of an antelope sharpened in the middle and harder portion of the column, the joint serving for a grip for the hand. It was the universal prehistoric sewing implement of savage women and persists to our day.
In every living tribe of basket makers these awls are among the commonest of woman’s tools, most serviceable in sewing garments as well. They are dug up in mounds, found in caves, and are rarely absent from the work baskets of mummies in the arid regions.4
Frank H. Cushing was of the opinion that the bone awl was far better for fine basket work than any implement of steel; the point, being a little rounded, would find its way between the stitches of the coil underneath and not force itself through them. The iron awl, being hard and sharp, breaks the texture and gives a very rough and clumsy appearance to the surface, as will be seen in fig. 51.
Coiled basketry in point of size presents the greatest extreme. There are specimens delicately made that will pass through a lady’s finger ring, and others as large as a flour barrel; some specimens have stitching material one-half inch wide, as in the Pima granaries, and in others the root material is shredded so fine that nearly 100 stitches are made within an inch of space. In form the coiled ware may be perfectly flat, as in a table mat, or built up into the most exquisite jar shape. In design the upright stitches lend themselves to the greatest variety of intricate patterns.
Coiled basketry may be divided into ten varieties, based on structural characteristics.
The foundation of the coil may be (1) asingle element, either splint, or stem, or rod; (2) a stem or other single element, with a thin welt laid on top of it; (8) two or more stems one over another; (4) two stems or other elements laid side by side, with or without a welt; (5) three stems in triangular position; (6) a bundle of splints or small stems; (7) a bundle of grass or small shreds.
The stitches pass around the foundation in progress (1) interlocking with and sometimes splitting stitches, but not inclosing the foundation underneath; (2) under one rod of the coil beneath, however many there may be; (3) undera welt of the coil beneath; (4) through splints or other foundation, in some cases systematically splitting the sewing material underneath. With these explanations it is possible to make the following ten varieties of coiled basketry, matting, or bagging:
A. Coiled work without foundation.
ZL. Simple interlocking coils.
C. Single-rod foundation.
D. Two-rod foundation.

These will now be taken up systematically and illustrated. (See fio. +1.)
A. Coiled work without foundation.—Specimens of this class have been already mentioned. The sewing material is babiche or fine rawhide thong in the cold north, or string of some sort farther south. In the Mackenzie Basin will be found the former, and in the tropical and
Fia. 41.
subtropical areas the latter. If a plain, spiral spring be coiled or hooked into one underneath, the simplest form of the open coiled work will result. An improvement of this is effected when the moving thread in passing upward after interlocking is twined one or more times about its standing part. (See figs. 41 A and 100.)
The technical process just mentioned is practiced among the Athapascan tribes of the Mackenzie River drainage. It is doubtful whether anciently the predecessors of these Indian women did such fine work in rawhide. The steel-bladed knife made slender babiche possible, and the thrift brought about by the Hudson Bay Company made it desirable. But it will be seen that the Mound-builders had the weave and could produce in flax texture even'more delicate than the muskemoots or hunting bags of the northern tribes.

It is supported by a rude framework
of sticks. The network is of agave twine and is made of interlocking coils, looking as all-coiled basketry would if the foundation were removed.
Further on illustrations will be given showing the wide extent of this technical process of coiled basketry without foundation. Examples in the U. S. National Museum come from as far south as Paraguay and even the Straits of Magellan. It is in common use as far north as northern Mexico. Both the possession of different material and the demands of a tropical life have occasioned the employment of this particular technic in articles of common use about the household. Its relation to coiled basketry and bead work is shown by the fact that women in making the fabric use a needle to carry the thread or string around through the row of work preceding. A small rod or mesh
gauge is used to secure uniformity in the size of the meshes.
B. Simple interlocking coils.—Coiled work in which there may be
any sort of foundation, but the stitches merely interlock without catching under the rods or splints or grass beneath. This form easily passes into those in which the stitch takes one or more elements of the foundation, but in a thorough ethnological study small differences can not be overlooked. (See fig. 41 B.)
Fig. 43 represents this style of workmanship on a coiled basket in grass stems from Alaska, collected by Lucien M. Turner. The straws for sewing merely interlock without gathering the grass roll.
In the imbricated basket work of British Columbia and Washington the sewing is done with splints of cedar root and the stitches

<<<Page: 280>>>

interlock. Two quite distinct styles of foundation are used, namely, bunches of splints taken from the more brittle and rough interior of the cedar root. and two flat strips of the smooth layer on the outside of the root. The surface of the one will be rugose, of the other, flat and smooth. (See figs. 52, 53, and 54 and Plates 156-161.)
Figs. 44 and 45 represent a type of coiled work in vogue among the Mescalero Apaches. As has been said previously, the Apache Indians, who live in the arid regions of Arizona, made the foundations of their coiled basketry of hard rods. In various tribes these rods are arranged in a foundation after different patterns. It will be seen by examining the drawing here given that three rods form the basis of the coil. They are laid oné on another in a vertical row, the

stitches simply interlocking so that the greatest economy of work is effected. It is not known that any other tribe in America practices this peculiar arrangement of the foundation rods. This specimen, ‘at. No. 211941, in the U. S. National Museum, was collected by F. M. Covert.
Plate 24 shows a style of coiled weaving called openwork. This specimen, in the collection of C. E. Rumsey, Riverside, California, is termed a grasshopper basket, but it belongs to a type of technic that has a very wide distribution, and probably has nothing to do with holding live insects. The foundation is a bundle of shredded material or grass. The sewing is a splint of hard wood. This is wrapped a certain number of times around the foundation and then caught under the sewing of the coil underneath, the stitches interlocking. Perhaps a few bits of the

<<<Page: 281>>>

foundation are caught also in the stitch. After two stitches are made in this way the wrapping continues. It is possible by counting this last as well as the number of stitches to reproduce beautiful patterns on the surface. The ornamentation also may be varied by the use of different colored splints. This specimen is from the Watchumna (Mariposan) Indians of middle California, but examples are in the National Museum collected from Norway, Porto Rico, and Peru. (See Plates 224 and 248.)
C. Single-rod foundation.—In rattan basketry and Pacific coast yare, called by Dr. J..W. Hudson tsai in the Pomo language, the foundation is a single stem, uniform in diameter. The stitch passes around the stem in progress and is caught under the one of the preceding coil, as in fig. 41 C. In a collection of Siamese basketry in the U. S. National Museum the specimens are all made after this fashion. The foundation is the stem of the plant in its natural state; the sewing is with splints of the same material, having the glistening surface outward. As this is somewhat unyielding it is difficult to crowd the stitches together, and so the foundation is visible between. California is not far behind the East in the quality of material, willow for the basis of the coil, and plants in a variety of colors for the sewing. The Siamese coiled basketry has little of design on its surface, but the American basketmaker may fix whatever her imagination may suggest. The effect of the plain stitching is pleasing to the eye by reason of the regular broken surface. In America single-rod basketry is widely spread. Along the Pacific coast it is found in northern Alaska and as far south as the borders of Mexico. The Pomo Indians BEE use it in some of theirfinest workas (7907 O° °° 7S 2 a ene The roots of plants and soft stems of willow, rhus, and the like are used for the sewing, and, being soaked thoroughly, can be crowded together so as to entirely conceal the foundation. (See fig. 46.)
Plate 25 represents a collection of Pomo treasure baskets, all in single-rod foundation, called tsai by Dr. Hudson and bam tsha or bam

tshai by Carl Purdy. These specimens are in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb; the foundation is of willow rod, the sewing material of sedge root, the design in the cercis splints, the decoration with shells, beads, and partridge plumes. The method of sewing is on all of these baskets the same as shown in fig. 41 C.
Plate 26, Cat. No. 89801 U.S.N.M., is from Point Barrow, Alaska, and was collected by Capt. P. H. Ray, U.S. Army. The material is shoots and roots of willow, and the specimen was secured from Eskimo people living at the extreme northern point of Alaska. It had evidently been procured, however, from Indians near by. On the bottom small rods are used for the foundation and the sewing is in straight lines backward and forward until this portion is finished. Here the foundation rods are somewhat larger and the sewing splints wider. Comparing this specimen, then, with a great many others from the same area, the uniformity in size of the foundation rod is noticeable. It will also be noted that the stitches are not driven home closely, a feature which occurred over and over again in coiled basketry between Point Barrow and the Republic of Mexico.
D. Two-rod foundation.—One rod in this style lies on top of the other; the stitches pass over two rods in progress and under the upper one of the pair below, so that each stitch incloses three stems in a vertical series (fig. 47). A little attention given to fig. 41 D will demonstrate that the alternate rod, or eee aT the upper rod, in each pair will be in9 *°7*?*70% OF MNO Ros, Ven closed in two series of stitches, while the other or lower rod will pass along freely in the middle of one series of stitches and show on the outer side. Examples of this two-rod foundation are to be seen among the Athapascan tribes of Alaska, among the Pomo Indians of the Pacific coast, and among the Apache of Arizona. An interesting or specialized variety of this type is seen among the Mescaleros of New Mexico, who use the two-rod foundation, but instead of passing the stitch around the upper red of the coil below simply interlock the stitches so that neither one of the two rods is inclosed twice. This Apache ware is sewed with yucca fiber and the brown root of the same plant, producing a brilliant effect, and the result of the special technic isa flat surface like that of pottery. The U. S. National Museum possesses a single piece of precisely the same technic from the kindred of the Apache on the Lower Yukon. (See figs. 44 and 45.)
KE. Lod and welt foundation.—In this kind of basketry the singlerod foundation is overlaid by a splint or strip of tough fiber, some-

<<<Page: 283>>>

times the same as that with which the sewing is done; at others, a strip of leaf or bast. The stitches pass over the rod and strip which are on top down under the welt only of the coil below, the stitches interlocking. The strip of tough fiber between the two rods which serves
for a welt has a double purpose—
' iw \ \
strenethening the fabric and chinking the space between the rods (fig. 48). This style of coil work is seen on old Zuni basket jars and on California examples. This type of foundation passes easily into forms C, D, EK, and F. In fact, it is impossible to distinguish between them without marring the specimen. (See fig. 41.)

are a water bottle and a gathering basket of the Utes; that is, they are of Ute motive. Such pieces, however, are often seen among other tribes and in some of the later pueblos. By looking carefully at the surface of the pictures it will be seen that there may be two rods, the upper much smaller tae

Plate 28 represents two fine old coiled baskets from the pueblo of Sia, on the Rio Grande River, New Mexico. In addition to the strueture, which consists of two rods and a splint above sewed with willow splints, the stitches interlocking and catching in the welt below, the ornamentation a stepped design, suggestive of pueblo architecture on the upper figure and spirals made up of colored rectangles on the lower figure, needs to be merely pointed out. The characteristic sought to be illustrated here in this connection is the false braid made on the surface produced by sewing a single splint ina ficure of eight weaving, shown in the plate. The modern Indians of this pueblo do not make basketry of this character, and it is altogether reasonable to think that in the olden times these pieces came into the possession of these people by traffic from Shoshonean tribes near by.

The technic is as follows: Three or four small willow stems of uniform thickness serve for the foundation, as shown in fig. 50; also in cross section in fig. +1 G. The sewing, which may be in splints of willow, black or white carex root, or cercis stem, passes around the three stems constituting the coil, under the upper one of the bundle below, the stitches interlocking. In some examples this upper rod is replaced by a thin strip of material serving for a welt (see fig. 41 F). In the California area the materials for basketry are of the finest quality. The willow stems and carex root are susceptible of division into delicate filaments. Sewing done with these is most compact, and when the stitches are pressed closely together the

coil beneath (fig. 51). In the Pomo language it is called chilo, but it has no standing in that tribe. In the Great Interior Basin, where the pliant material of the California tribes is wanting, only the outer and younger portion of the stem will do for sewing. The interior parts in such examples are made up into the foundation. All such ware is rude, and the sewing frequently
passes through instead of around MATa the stitches below. In the Kli= — -——

fan)
In asmail area on Fraser River, in southwestern Canada, on the :
upper waters of the Columbia, and in many Salishan tribes of northwestern Washington, basketry, valled imbricated, is made. The foundation, as said, is in cedar or spruce root, while the sewing is done with the outer and tough portion of the root; the stitches pass over the upper bundle of splints and are locked with those underneath. On the outside of these bas-_ kets is a form of technic, which also constitutes the ornamentation.
It is not something added, or overlaid, or sewed on, but is a part of the texture effected in the progress of the manufacture. (See fig. 52.) The method of adding this ornamentation in strips of cherry bark, cedar bast, and grass stems, dyed with Oregon grape, is unique, and on this account I have applied the term ‘‘imbricated” to the style of weave here shown. (See fig. 53.)
The strip of colored bark or grass is laid down and caught under a passing stitch; before another stitch is taken this one is bent forward to cover the last stitch, doubled on
FIG. 4. itself so as to be underneath the NAMM A Srey Arias next stitch, and so with each one it eee is bent backward and forward so that the sewing is entirely concealed, forming a sort of ‘* knife plaiting.”
In some of the finer old baskets in the National Museum, collected over sixty years ago, the entire surface is covered with work of this kind, the strips not being over an eighth of an inch wide. James Teit describes and illustrates this type of weaving among the Thomp-

son River Indians of British Columbia, who are Salishan. The body of the basket is in the root of Thuja plicata, and the ornamentation in strips of L’lymus triticotdes and Prunus demissa, (See fig. 54.) Imbrication is one of the most restricted of technical processes. Eells says that some women in every tribe on Puget Sound could produce the stitch, and he names the Puyallups, Twanas, Snohomish, Clallam, Makah, Skagit, Cowlitz, Chehalis, Nisqualli, and Squaxon.

It illustrates several important features in the basket maker’s art. In the first place, the Indians of this area did not know how to make a beginning of the bottom of a rectangular basket with coiled work, so a block was inserted or foundation strips were laid parallel and were whipped together after the manner of coiled work. This figure also shows how the splitting of stitches before mentioned in sewing may have at first been accidental, the basket maker having in mind only the purpose of placing the stitches in vertical rows. From this unintentional fur‘ation of the stitches comes the purposeful splitting, the forked stitches being made alike and uniform. Thus,

out of a careless habit has come one of the beautiful ornamentations in coiled basketry. A third purpose in this figure is to show, perhaps, the initial step in imbricated work. — Indeed, this form of overlaying is seen on many examples of it. A straw of squaw grass (Yerophyllum tena) 1s inclosed under a stitch; it is then turned back; a second stitch is made
and the strip of grass laid over it. Thus, over the surface there is an alternation of exposed and concealed stitches by means of this material. This is elsewhere called ** beading.”

stems, or small midribs from palm leaves, or shredded yuecea. The effect in all such ware is good, for the reason that the maker has perfect control of her material. Excellent examples of this kind are to be seen in the southwestern portions of the United States, among the Pueblos and Missions, and in northern Africa. The sewing may be done with split stems of hard wood, willow, rhus, and the like, or, as in the case of the Mission baskets in southern California, of the stems of

Between the refined type of coiled work of this class and the old-fashioned straw beehive or the Mohave granary is along distance. These thick Hopi plaques have their nearest resemblance in the Moorish basketry of North Africa and leave the question onthe mind whether from lone contact the Hopi themselves may not have gotten a suggestion therefrom.

The outer rows of coiling belong to the single-stick variety. On the rest of the surface the binding material in passing around the foundation rods makes a whole turn on itself between them. The basket is 94 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep.
Basketry is rendered water-tight by closeness of texture and by daubing with pitch or asphaltum. Both twined and coiled ware are useful for this latter purpose. It is said of the mother of Moses that she ‘‘took for him an ark of bulrushes and
AS <x
daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein, and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.” (Exodus ii, 3.) Now, the Egyptians and other Hamites of our day make coiled basketry of type fig. 41 1; that is, with a foundation of shredded material sewed with finely split palm leaf. The foundation is quite thick, so that the ware is strikingly like the Hopi plaques of the Middle Mesa. There is no reason for believing that the ancient ware differed from the modern. In the Interior Basin also baskets are used for pottery by tribes that are not sedentary. (See Plate 32.)
Major J. W. Powell, during his topographical and geological survey of the valley of the Colorado River of the West, in company with Prof. A. H. Thompson, made a collection of water-tight basket work

from the Paiute Indians (Shoshonean family) in southern Utah, and additions have been made by Dr. Walter Houghand others. Both coiled and twined work are found in great varieties. Plate 32 represents the varieties of these water-tight carrying jugs or bottles. Fig. 1 of the plate, Cat. No. 11882, is a Tsai a wats, in twined weaving, the pattern being twilled work.

Figs. 4 and 5, Cat. Nos. 213101-2, in the U. S. National Museum, are small canteens, collected from the Havasupai Indians, in Cataract Canyon, by Dr. Walter Hough. They are precisely the same in structure as the foregoing, though the Havasupai are of the Yuman family, while the Utes are Shoshonean. Height, 7} inches and 8} inches.
Fig. 6, Cat. No. 211020, U.S.N.M., is Paiute water jar for carrying, from the collection of Captain Carr, U.S. Army. The foundation is of splints, and the pitch is carefully restricted to the inside. Horsehair lugs support the headband of old leather. Height, 9 inches.
Fig. 7, Cat. No. 11880, U.S.N.M., is an excellent specimen of twined work in twill, with single rows of three-ply twine and the neck in openwork. In many examples like the one here shown the melted pitch or asphaltum is poured inside and rinsed around until the surface is covered. Height, 9 inches. The rope handle gives the appearance of a pitcher.

Plate 33 is a water jar of the White Mountain Apaches, Cat. No. 213278, U.S.N.M., collected by Dr. Walter Hough. It is made in diagonal twined weaving and covered with pitch. Three lugs of wood attached to the sides are for the purpose of suspension and carrying. The height is 12 inches.
Having studied the structural processes on the body of these textiles, it will now be in order to note how the work is finished off. A elance at a lady’s workbasket or a waste-paper basket shows how important

<<<Page: 291>>>

such an examination must be. Both in woven and in twined ware many beautiful specimens will be seen, whose edges differ not in the slightest degree from other portions of the basket. Indeed, the Tlinkit, the Pomo, and the Mission weavers all frequently affect the plain border on their ware, and certain kinds of plaques of the Hopi Indians, said to be the workmanship of unmarried women, leave the foundation exposed, and the work is suddenly brought to an end. Another fact will surprise the student, namely, that technically the border is often in quite another class of weave. This grows, as will be seen, out of the exigencies of the case. A checker weaving, with the edges left open all around, would be a flimsy affair. Coiled work lends a hand in putting a finish on woven work; the latter, or an imitation of it, on the contrary, becomes an embellishment of the former. The drawings and the plates will explain more clearly than words the structure of borders. The motive in this inquiry should be to learn the steps or evolutionary processes through which the ingenious savage woman’s mind has passed in this series of inven-
tions to discover, if possible, a little truth about the relationship and communication among Wi tribes in olden times, and to learn

be studied in the following order: The finishing off in checker work, in wicker work, in twilled work, in twined work, and in coiled work.
The first and simplest method of making borders is illustrated in examples collected among the Abenaki Indians of Canada belonging to the Algonquian family. The baskets are made of splints from the ash, formerly worked out with aboriginal tools (see fig. 60), but nowadays made by machinery. The foundation of the borders consists of three narrow hoops. Every alternate warp splint is cut off flush, the others are bent down over the middle hoop and pushed under the upper row of weaving, having first been pointed. Outside and inside of this middle hoop and clasping the bends in the warp splints are the other two hoops, the whole being bound securely together by a coiled sewing in splint. The specimen here figured is Cat. No. 206390, U.S.N.M., made by Caroline Masta. Diameter, 54 inches; height, 3 inches.

The border of twilled work, when the weaving is finished, resembles closely the interlacing of a series of crossed warps. In matting made

<<<Page: 292>>>

in this way the ends of the warp and of the weft are bent backward on one another and forced under the texture. In one example a twilled mat is finished out with wicker weaving, both sets of elements being straightened out for warp. (See fig. 12.) The margin is then finished off as if the whole mass had been in-wicker weaving. The example here shown was made recently by an Indian woman in the Zuni pueblo, western New Mexico. (See fig. 61.) The material is stripped leaves of yucca, from which coarse mats, basket bowls, and trays are made. The mat is woven square and a hoop of wood is pro-

less intricacy, forming a rope pattern on the outside. So much of wicker basketry as originated with the Indians is very simple in the matter of finishing. Cat. No. 215487 shows how this sort of work is done. The basket is the work of the Zuni Indians, New Mexico, and is the gift of Mr. G. B. Haggett. Diameter, 93 inches. (See fig. 62.)
The variation of this type may be seen in the next figure. The

warp stems are in pairs and are bent in this case to the left at right angles and woven out and in among the next three or four sets, returning to the starting point. It is not altogether certain that this style of finishing the border was invented by the Indians, but they have adopted it. This drawing is made from specimens in the collection of G. Wharton James. (See fig. 63.)

In the next example the handle is a stiff splint of hickory, circular in shape. The wide hoop border shown in the drawing and the cireular hoop are the framework from which the weave begins. All the smaller warp elements focus at the junction of these two. The widening is effected by the introduction of fresh warp elements as the work proceeds; the weft makes only a short excursion at the beginning

The term twined basketry is

or the like. Such a variety of oe
material will demand in the finishing off various kinds of borders. Lieutenant Emmons speaks of the border of the basket as its life and says that while a rent in the side or bottom of a wallet may be sewed with fresh root, the breaking of the edge suggests at once to the woman the gathering of materials for a new basket. The great variety of borders in this type of weaving can be best understood by studying specimens. It will he interesting to begin this by comparing examples from two widely separated areas, namely, the caves of Kentucky and the distant islands of the Aleutian chain, both in soft warp. (See Plate 143.)

quarter of an inch to an inch apart. At the top, where the twined work finishes, the warp cords are brought together in groups of five and twisted into a rope fora short distance. They are then gathered into a continuous braid; the ends of those plaited in are cut off when the ends of anew set are taken up. This very elaborate form of border will also be found later on in Washington. (See fig. 65.) The methods of finishing borders on twined work among the Salishan tribes are shown

gether as one, bent backward behind the two preceding ones, then forward under a row of twined weaving, serving to hold them in place, the loose end showing on the inside. (See fig. 66.) Turning now to twined weaying on hard foundation, it will be a matter of surprise that the Pomo Indians, who make some of the finest twined basketry in the world, take no pains in finishing off the upper margin of many pieces.

actually wears out before it unravels. Granary baskets, mill hoppers, mush bowls, and other varieties in common use have this sort of margin. In the drawing here shown tbe weft is supposed to be untwisted, and the whole is enlarged in order to exhibit the texture. When complete the warp is driven close together and the little sticks of alder or willow forming the warp are left protruding.
In the following illustration the same principle obtains of making little or no change in the finishing, but the technic is three-strand instead of two-strand. The figure represents a section of a meal bowl of the Ceyal

They are then cut ‘so that there will be always three of them included. The coil or seizing of splints holds them all firmly in place. The top of the basket megsures 4$ inches in diameter.

This same process of imitating braid on the border of a basket by the ingenious wrapping of a single splint becomes much more complex in coiled basketry, as will be seen later in many figures.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. 267 Alaska, and the Haida Indians, on the Queen Charlotte ssiands. Neither of these great families use coiled work, and they employ little of other types of weaving than the twined. The Tlinkits are more ornamental and use colored grasses in their false embroidery, while the Haidas never employ such decorations, but excel in plain and diagonal twined work and in 3-strand weaving. Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U.S. Navy, has studied these people closely for many years, and the information regarding the borders of these tribes is derived from him,
According to this authority, fully nine-tenths of all the baskets used by the Tlinkits are of the open cylindrical type, in which the border is
called upon to sustain more than its proportion of the wear in use. Some tribes have always used certain trimmings, plaitings, or hraidines to the exclusion of others, and the work of different periods within tribal limits shows marked preferences. ‘Two principal methods are employed in the finish of the border edge, (1) by trimming off the warp

ends flush with the last spiral of weave (see Plate 44), and (2) by turning the warp over and fastening it down to the standing part by twined weaving or braiding. The first system is always used with covered baskets and generally with double baskets, where the two borders give protection to each other, with hats and mats, and generally with all types of baskets made for the tourist trade. The second method is employed in all open baskets made for use and in the finer varieties with double warp. When extreme nicety is required, the inner strand or layer of the double warp is cut off two lines of weave below the top, so that when the outer strand is turned down on the standing half the thickness of the border is not increased beyond that of the regular walls. But whether the warp is cut off flush or turned over, the last few eee of weave are generally strengthened by additional twining,
aes sennit, or embroidery. There are a few os in the

collection of the National Museum in which the turned reverted ends of warp stems are braided among themselves.
This braided warp is held together by rows of twined weaving.
1. The crudest border, or really want of border, consists in cutting off the ends of the warp even with the last spiral of two-strand weft. This is universally practiced with the covered work basket, and is often the finish of the smaller double basket. (See fig. 67.)
2. Border with the warp ends cut off flush, the one or more rows of three-strand twined woof around the edge adding strength to this part. (See fig. 68.)

3. In the third type of border a two-strand twine is laid vertically against the outside of the warp stems and held in place by another twostrand twine passing through the vertical twine and around the back of the warp stems. The vertical twine appears only on the outside of the basket. The horizontal twine is seen on the outside and the inside alike. (See fig. 73.)
4. In the fourth type of border a two-strand twine is ornamented on the outside with false embroidery precisely as on the body. In some cases a narrow band of this style of weaving occurs at the upper margin and is decorative as well as useful.

and around the second. These two styles of finishing hat borders are in use by the Haida in basketry, and may have been borrowed from them. (See fig. 75.)
7. In all open baskets made for use where strength is of primary importance the warp ends are doubled over on the standing part of the next warp splint in the direction of the weave, that is, to the right, and twined down to it with the weft. This finish is found on the oldest pieces of Yakutat work. It is often strengthened by the overlaid embroidery in straw or root around the last few spirals of weave. A number of technical processes employed when the warp is cut off flush

will be found also on the borders of specimens in which the warp is turned down.
8. With the turning down of the warp strands the three-strand woof twining is sometimes used in the place of the two strand.
(9) A later finish, and one generally found on the shallow, basin-like basket used as a work basket in weaving and as a berry screener, consists of a turning down of the warp ends as described, and, in addition, weaving a two-strand twining over the bights, forming a rope-like twist over the outer edge, and thoroughly protecting the more exposed parts of the warp. This character of finish occurs more among the Sitka, Hoonah, and Hootz ah tar tribes. The Chilcat never used it and the Yakutat only in the case of the basket-worker’s basket. It is certainly of more recent date, although not of to-day. (See fig. 76.)

In all instances where the warp ends are turned over, the ends of the woof splints in finishing off the border are twisted and run through the bights of the two or three last warp strands.

Fig. 80 shows a border of a basket hat from the Tlinkit Indians, Alaska, also collected by Lieutenant Emmons. The border represents two rows of regular twined weaving, the finishing in three-strand
braid (fig. 74). It will be noticed th . in crossing each warp rod one of the three members of the braid passes behind the warp, the other two remaining in front. On the inner side, therefore, the appearance will be that of the ordinary twined work. Cat. No. 168263. U75.N.M.

rows of twined work, are combined into a braid, as will be seen in fig. 73, the two rows of twining becoming one row of braid. As the braiding proceeds from the end of one warp stem to another the weft splint then on the inside is hooked over the end of the warp stem. In the drawing are shown also the plain twined weaving and diagonal or twilled work, by means of which figures are wrought on the surface of the hat.
In coiled basketry many specimens, often among the finest, as will be seen in the accompanying drawings, have in their borders the same structure as on the rest of the body. For each special type of coiled work there will be a variety of border. Frequently the coiled netting,

<<<Page: 305>>>

of which hammocks and other weaves without foundation are examples, is finished off by simply stopping the work. The same would be true in all the varieties of foundation mentioned in the previous section. In the present example the foundation consists of three rods or stems not set in triangular fashion, as in the best Pomo coiled work, but ina vertical series. This makes the rows much wider and economizes the sewing. But the varieties of this type are as numerous as the tribes of Indians practicing coiled weaving. (See fig. 82.)
Fig. 83 illustrates the same statement already made with reference to the so-called grasshopper basket (Plate 24). The drawing shows how, with a splint foundation, the sewing material interlocks with the stitches underneath, taking up at the same time one or more

In Plate 23, illustrating bifurcated stitches on a basket in the McLeod collection, will be seen the simplest departure from the ordinary coiled sewing on the border. The stitches pass forward one space, through and backward a space, making a herring-bone effect on the upper edge of the basket.
Plate 35, upper figure, illustrates a simple type of border work. The foundation is a bundle of splinters wrapped with splints of spruce root and sewed on here and there in regular order to the coil underneath, being bent between the stitches so as to form a regular sinuous line. On the next round the row is straight, wrapped like the first, and is sewed to the top of the sinuous coil underneath. On the top of all is another row,
the bends not being so high, ieee

Fig. 84 is the border of a coiled basket collected among the Hopi Indians by Victor Mindeleff, Cat. No. 84596, U.S.N.M. It will be seen that the foundation of the coiled work on the body of the basket consists of three rods on the same perpendicular plane. The stitch passes over the three; catches under one of the previous coils, the stitches interlocking. In finishing off this work a single rod is used for the margin or border. It is sewed to the upper rod of the previous foundation in plain coiled work; but while this process is going on aseries of three splints are twined around both the foundation and the stitches of the border. When the whole is drawn tight it gives the appearance of a very elaborate double-braided work, looked at from the outside, and a continuous twined or rope work on the upper margin. In order to make the style more comprehensible, a drawing from the border of Cat. No. 204833 is introduced, fig. 85, in which the elements of the border twine are in different colors.

The two examples just shown illustrate what was previously said about using twined work for the borders of coiled weave, and the opposite in nee among the Tlinkits. Fig. 86 represents the border of a coiled basket of the Sia Indians of New Mexico, Cat. No. 134213, U.S.N.M., collected by Mrs. Matilda
C. Stevenson. A hoop is used for the foundation of the border, and it is first made fast to the regular sewing underneath by means of a simple coiled splint on the outside of this. The ornamental border consists of an ordinary figure-of-eight wrapping, as in doing up a kite string, going from left to right. A splint passes under the foundation rod toward the front, and then forward five stitches over, behind, and under, back three stitches and under. The same process repeated gives the form of a braid on the outside. Finally, by the manipula

Ornamentation in and on basketry is to be studied with three teachers or guides—the technician, the artist, and the folklorist. With the first named are learned the varied materials as to color and texture, the technicai elements and their forms, and the methods of assembling them. The artist will show how these elements, on the one hand, open possibilities for esthetic effects, and how, on the other hand, the stitches and decussations handicap attempts at free-hand drawing. The foiklorist examines the pictography, the totemism, the lore and mythology of the ornamentation, with a view of putting the student into intellectual and spiritual relationship with the basket maker. Without her basket-making would be merely a trade or calling, and the art student would be utterly helpless in detecting the alphabet of design. This phase of the subject will be elaborated in the chapter on symbolism.
Great help in this investigation would be derived from a visit to the humble artist to watch the processes through which the fine effects have been elaborated. To this inquiry special attention will here be given. It should be added in passing that in producing her effects the basket maker must be fully equipped for her work before the first stitch or check is attempted. The painter, the potter, and the sculptor may add finishing touches or make corrections after the work is done, but the basket maker is like the muvician—every detail in the production must be attended to correctly at the time. There is no chance to go back and remedy defects. Decoration on basketry is studied under the following heads:
A. Form and structure.
B. Ornamentation through color.
Form and color may be studied (1) on the basket as a whole; (2) on the minutest structural elements; and (3) in the designs upon the surface. These will be taken up in order and treated in their relation to the sense of the beautiful, present in the humble Indian woman’s mind as well as in those more refined. Growth, progress from pure naturalism to greater and greater artificiality, may be observed here quite as marked as in other activities. To illustrate what is here said by way of introduction, Plate 36 represents a coiled basket of the Mission Indians in the collection of G. Wharton James. The noteworthy characteristics of this basket bowl are the effects produced by variety in designs and color in shades, as well as by symmetry of outline. The sharp contrast seen in the designs are due not to modern dyes, but

<<<Page: 311>>>

toa skillful use of Nature’s colors. Under the descriptions of materials attention was called to the variety of natural pigmentation in the stems and roots of the plants used in the construction of the Mission work. The center of the specimen is in rectangles the colors of which alternate between white and dark brown. The center zone is made up in straw color, white, and black; the third or outer zone in natural shades of the stem—white, brown, and black— with here and there spots of brown introduced into the straw-colored sewing. The outer edge isin brown and white. Anciently the Mission baskets were not nearly so gaudy looking, but among the frequent transformations in artistic forms and colors this example illustrates progress in the adoption of really beautiful motives of a high order.
The elaboration of decoration in form first, and then of color, will now be taken up more minutely. The aesthetic side of this part of the subject is so well explained by Holmes,¢ that it is here only necessary to make plain the technical elements and processes involved in ornamentation.
As on Pueblo-pottery, so on basketry, some patterns are merely likenesses of things, and that is all. A step in advance of this is the portraiture of some particular and sacred natural feature, mountain, body of water, trait, etc. Pictography is one grade higher, and, beginning with attempts at figuring animals and plants entire, runs the whole gamut of transformation, ending with conventional metonymies, synecdoches, and geometric patterns of the classic type.
Form in basketry is decided at the outset, not by the desire to create something artistic, but to produce a useful receptacle. There is scarcely a basket so rude, however, that a sense of symmetry and other artistic qualities did not enter into its composition, both as to its general outline and the management of its details. These varied forms are decided in reality by:
(a) Function, which is discussed in the chapter on uses, from the purely industrial point of view.
(>) Materials, shown in the chapter on manufacture as to their variety and quality, but here considered as suggesting and restricting form.
(c) Imitation of natural objects and of forms of utensils in other materials.
(7) Physiological limitations. Both in the making of the basket and in using it the Indian woman had ever in view the convenience of her own body. The curves of the basket itself, the length and width, the proportion of all its parts, as well as convenience of holding,
“Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1889, pp. 189-252.

<<<Page: 312>>>

transporting, and utilizing, all had reference to the woman’s physicat frame.
(e) Aesthetic purpose. The desire to produce something beautiful in itself without any regard to other motives.
If there be any beauty in work belonging to the first step it is purely adventitious, the weaver did not effect it purposely. In the next higher grade there are no separate elements of beauty, but the utilitarian features are dominated by taste purposely. A third class of aesthetic forms, one step higher, enhance the beauty of the basket, but do not diminish its serviceability. It seems a pity to waste so much prolonged work and lovely design and color on a mere berrypicking basket or a pot for cooking with hot stones, but who will say nay? Finally, usefulness is ignored or sacrificed to pure aestheticism. (See Plates 11, 93, 45, ‘70, and 71.)
When the very lowly and practical functions of a great deal of this ware are considered one has a striking example of the way in which the sense of beauty may coexist with forlorn poverty and surroundings, as may also be seen by comparing the most skillful basket maker with her workshop. This thought must not be carried too far, however, in understanding the culture status of the woman, since all artists are busy practically with uncleanly materials and do not wear their best attire in the studio. On this same practical side, also, the love of beauty for its own sake may not be the entire motive in the artist’s mind; her natural ambition and pride of achievement in technical skill, and perhaps envy, have much to do with preeminent success—quite as much with her as with artists at the other end of civilization. The same discrimination is made by art critics in the highest walks of culture. The singer or musician who renders a technically difficult piece may be stimulated quite as much by pride of performance as by the overpowering influence of aesthetic feeling. It is difficult to sound the depths of the Indian woman’s motives, but in the matter of shape, as will be seen, her masterpieces are fine models of symmetry and grace. Quite every plate in this paper will illustrate in some way or another what will be said respecting the ornamentation of Indian basketry in the six geographic areas. In each one of the phases under which shape as a decorative element is studied there will be found a response in the different parts of the hemisphere.
The study of form and structure in the ornamentation of basketry will be now considered under the heads named: First, the shape of the basket as a whole; second, the minute structural elements out of which all designs on basketry are formed, and third, the designs on the surface of the basket and their combination into symbols or composite ornamentations. (See Plate 37.)

<<<Page: 313>>>

The shapes of basketry have relation to the forms of solid geometry. The cube, the cone, the cylinder, the spbere, are the bases of all simple and complicated varieties. In softer material basketry approaches matting. The products are then flat or pliable, although the process of manufacture is the same. Among the eastern tribes of the United States the Algonkin and Iroquois baskets are all cylindrical or rectangular in outline. The same is true of the tribes in the Southern United States, although the greater flexibility of the reed cane invites the basket weaver to a wider diversity. In the Interior Basin and everywhere else the wild flax and other fibrous plants abounded, the sack, rectangular in outline, prevailed, but in the western portions of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains the prevalence of birch bark occasioned a variety of solid forms. The Indians of the Interior Basin also employ the cylinder largely. The same is true of the Eskimo, of Alaska, while the Aleutian Islanders, especially in the outer islands, having the flexible wild grass to work with, return to the form of the bag or satchel. The cylinder and the rectangle prerail among the Haida and Tlinkit, while the soft wallet, rectangular in outline, were more common farther south. The Salish and other tribes of Indians, of Columbia and Washington, diversified in their tribal and linguistic elements, produced many forms of baskets. Those in touch with the Hudson’s Bay Company were very quick to imitate the shapes of packages used by them. In this region, also, since the boiling with hot stones was a prevalent method of cooking, the basket pot, somewhat cylindrical in motive yet more in the form of a truncated cone, was seen in every house. What is said about the diversity of form among the Salish tribes is true all along the Pacific coast of the United States. Here also is to be found the conical baskets in great abundance, since the people were partly vegetarians or diggers. The carrying basket is a prominent feature in collections from this area. From these simple geometric forms were developed dishes, jars, bottles, packing cases, and so on, in unlimited numbers, combining the cylinder, the cone, and the rectangle. In many of these the jar-shaped necks of pottery are imitated, in which the elements of the sphere and the spheroid are used.
In giving the forms just indicated to basketry the Indian woman has always in mind the elements of the beautiful as well as of the useful. It is considered a reproach to violate the rules of bilateral symmetry or proportion in form. A superficial view of a large collection of baskets from any portion of America would strike the most careless observer as the fruits of thoughtful and painstaking labor on wxsthetic lines. These forms are often said to be mere imitations of something the savage woman has seen in nature or in other arts. Imitation is indeed one of the elements in this problem, but it is an entire misconception of

<<<Page: 314>>>

the underlying plan to suppose that the skillful weaver is a slave to natural patterns. Indeed, it might also be averred that she is less subservient to such things than artisans of much higher grade. On entering the workshops of civilization one sees the walls loaded with designs and models after which to work, but rarely would the observer see an Indian woman looking to any other source than her own imagination for the model of her basket; strictly speaking, she never makes two alike. A close observation of the weaver at her work demonstrates the fact that the eye, the hand, the curves of the body, the angles of the lower limbs, all contribute their share to giving beautiful forms to basketry. The following illustrations will show the gradations of general outline through which basketry passes, the maker keeping always in mind the sense of pleasure to be awakened or gratified.
They are as follows: a, flat forms; 4, dish forms; c, bowl forms; d, jar forms; and ¢, miscellaneous forms.
(a) The simplest of these is the flat tray, mat, wallet, sail, gambling plaque, and more. They assume endless varieties of outline, and through the stimulus of trade all sorts of shapes result, table mats of standard patterns in Sitka and Vancouver Island, rectangular wallets in Washington, Idaho, and Montana, but especially the gambling plaques of California.
Plate 38 shows two flat plaques of this form, the upper one from the Tule River country, Tulare County, California, the lower one from Madera County, both in the collection of E. L. McLeod, of Bakerstield, California. The coiling, if well done, would produce the circular outline. The Indian woman who constructed the plaque made the stitches under the spell of this art motive. A number of additional examples of artistic forms in flat basketry will be found in Plates 6 and 61.4
(4) Use cooperates with beauty in deepening the basket into a shallow plate as among the Hopi (Moki) for the sacred meal in their prayer ceremonials, but more attractive still are the so-called Navaho ceremonial baskets. (See Plate 39). These beautiful objects have attracted much attention also through their association with Navaho ceremonies. They are called ghost deans wedding baskets, and various other names, all associated with the Navaho religion, The dish baskets shown in the plate are in the collection of Fred Harvey. The same form exists along the Pacific States wherever meal or other vegetal diet is eaten. They are the common dish in which the mush is served throughout the acorn-bearing parts of California. It is an excellent example of adaptation to use, consistent at the same time with correct esthetic expression. Doing her best in producin ing ne proper f form

she was not hampered by the fear of lessening utility. Figures of similar shapes will be seen in Plates 93, 216.
(c) Deepening the plate or dish gives the bowl an unlimited number of forms and emancipates the basket maker. All through the southwestern United States the olla is the prevailing form. It is a segment cut from a sphere, marvelous in symmetry when the production of a master hand. Departing from this simple outline, varieties are produced by flattening the bottom and straightening the body until the truncated cone and regular cylinder are reached. The quality of the material used may have a little to do with the general outline, but it is charming to see how easily the savage woman overcomes the obstinacy of nature and persuades reluctant wood to do the work of grass and soft fibers. Cylindrical forms are in favor with the Aleuts, with the Haidas of Queen Charlotte Islands, with the Tlinkits of southeastern Alaska, and some tribes in Washington and Oregon. In the eastern parts of Canada and the United States cylindrical forms are mixed with rectangular. he baskets shown in Plate 40 are in the collection of E. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield, California. These are all from Kern County, and include hats as well as domestic forms. It will be noticed that some of the examples have straight conical bodies and others are curved outward, but none are incurved. As models for modern basketry these shapes can not be improved upon, since they are grounded in the structure of the human body itself. Reference will be again made to the baskets in this plate when the elementary forms are studied that go to make up the designs. The photograph does but half justice to the basketry from this region, which adds to the beauty of outline and variety of design the charms of tints and colors in varied materials.
(7) Baskets with constricted borders go by the general name of bottlenecks. If a motif be sought outside the desire of the Indian artist to have it thus, there is a style of old Pueblo pottery at hand which stands preeminent in southwestern United States.“ After the body of the vessel or basket is built up to the required height the work is drawn into the form of a jar or bottle. Attention has already been called to the fact that no pottery existed formerly on the west coast of North America. The few exceptions to this rule only intensify this absence. The place of pottery is taken by basketry, even for cooking. There is no limit to the pine trees yielding gum which will render basketry water-tight. The bottle-shaped basket soon appears and is installed as Aquarius of the Utes, the Apache, and other tribes andasaseed vessel. No sooner was its office fixed than it began to dress up in artistic form, and the inimitable bottleneck of the Panamint and other tribes in the Inyo-Kern and Tulare area appeared. The Apaches
aJ. W. Fewkes, Seventeenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1898, Plates 130, 131, 148.

<<<Page: 316>>>

are having the last word at this point in the adoption of correct ssthetio forms purely European. Plate 41 shows a group of Kern County bottlenecks in the collection of EK. L. MeLeod. Plate 42 illustrates a lot of Apache ollas in the collection of J. W. Benham, of New York City.
That these pretty jar shapes have little significance so far as tribes are concerned is shown by the fact that they occur all the way from Point Barrow in Alaska to southern California.
(e) This class includes all odd forms whatever. They are frequently made in imitation of objects that struck the Indian woman’s fancy. The very best examples of this are the imbricated baskets of the Fraser-Columbia drainage. A good collection of them tells the whole story accurately, starting from the conical forms, with foundation of splints and bottoms in shape of a watch spring to be found on the Klikitat and the Thompson River and ending below and above the Fraser mouth with flat and uniform foundation and straight lines in the bottom, the last shapes in the series being nothing more than imitations of Hudson Bay Company’s packages, trunks, cradles, and so on. These bizarre shapes are not confined to the mere imitation of white men’s devices. The demands of ceremony and_ religion required special forms of basketry. (See Plates 43, 157-172.
Finally, ornamentation in the form of the basket as a whole has kept pace with the multiplication of uses. The first contact of the Indians with the whites created new desires in their minds. Furthermore, It was not long before they discovered their best interests to lie in the direction of service to their conquerors. The supply of new wants and responses to the demands just mentioned would necessarily break in upon the ancient régime. Not at first, however, did the new object respond to the best workmanship. Plate 44 represents a part of the outfit of a Thnkit Indian in the service of the Russians. Among his other accouterments there must be a receptacle for ammunition. This must conform to those already in use. The result is the three forms shown in the plate. First, a small jar-shaped holder with a basketry cap-like cover; second, a bullet holder, in which the one basket fits exactly over another; third, a combination in which the cover is attached to the basket by means of a running string. All of these forms are shown in the plate. While drawing attention to these designs it will be well to examine their characteristics. The cover of No. 2 is plain twined weaving of the old-fashioned sort. The attractiveness of the work is in its regularity, both of vertical lines and horizontal weaving. The under portion of this double basket is covered over with false embroidery designs. No. 1 is an evident departure from ancient shapes, and the surface is covered with poor work in embroidery. No. 3 is more worthy of scrutiny. On the outer basket, or cover, plain weaving and embroidery alternate in single lines

<<<Page: 317>>>

and narrow bands. The lower, or inside, basket has its surface enveloped in embroidered weaving of excellent character and is wrought in three colors. The specimen is in the collection of L. H. Brittin, of Edgewater, New Jersey.
The composition of the basket, its molecular elements, so to speak, is guided largely by the materials. In cross section they are in their coarsest forms round, then half round, resulting from splitting whole stems. The finer sorts arise from further subdivision of stems, being roundish on the outside and flat within; or flat on both surfaces, as in the Canadian ash splints and the flat foundations of Fraser River baskets; or ribbon-like, as in basketry made of palm leaves; or threadlike, as in the coiled basketry of the Pomo, sewed with split sedge root as fine as pack thread. These various kinds and grades of materials in their tractability are dependent on climate, latitude, and phytogeography in the first place, and finally upon the maker’s grade of culture, on the form and function she had in mind, as well as on the higher forms of fine art, social rivalry, and mythology. (See Plate 45.)
In ultimate structure, basketry is free-hand mosaic or, in finest materials, like pen drawings or beadwork, the surface being composed of any number of small parts—technically decussations, stitches, or meshes, practically separate from one another so far as the effect on the eye is concerned. These mosaic parts are with some materials quite flat on the outer surface, as in the best matting and bags, while in others they stand out on account of the coarseness and rigidity of the wood. The object of mosaic ordinarily is to produce a flat surface for pavements or floors. The term ** mosaic,” here used as a simile, applies to such as is seen in mural decoration, where projections and depressions are wrought into artistic designs. In much basketry the separation of the stitches and exposure of a warp beneath having another color have precisely the same effect. In many examples the stems and roots are thoroughly soaked and rendered plastic and then pressed home, the parts being forced together, in which case the little elements become spindle-formed or hexagonal. Mosaic effects in basketry may be—(qa) Tessellate, as in checker or twilled weaving; (6) concentric, as in wicker and twined weaving, and (c) radiate in all coiled weaving. These must be kept in mind.
Unity in variety, the underlying principle of all ssthetic composition, finds its first step illustrated in the making up of a basket. The perfection of an Indian basket in its artistic technic is monotony, or monotechny, if such a word existed. In looking at a clumsy bit of work done by a child, or a beginner, one is aware of painstaking effort to make all the checks or stitches alike, ending in failure. In the most elegant pieces the victory is won, unity is achieved, With

<<<Page: 318>>>

her mouth for a vise and other purposes, with a flint knife, and the educated fingers, the patient and skillful artist formerly brought all her filaments to uniform thickness. At present scissors, awls, knives, and gauges (all of metal) aid her immensely in her task. The eyes and hands cooperating, in some instances through a hundred thousand efforts, produce elements of astonishing uniformity. This unity is of a very high order; for in many examples, coupled with a monotony of elements absolutely under control of the artist there is at the same time a charming variation in width and length of parts in harmony with, and made necessary by, the widening and narrowing of the basket. This unity ina myriad of details is the more noteworthy ina basket-maker’s art, in common with that of all other textile workers, because the individual elements are not lost or destroyed in the operation. The exceptions to this are rare, as in a few California specimens, where the coiled sewing is entirely obscured by overlaying of feathers. Usually the perfection of the stitch is the aim of the worker.
Plate 46 is a rare coiled basket made by a Washoe woman named. Datsolalee. It is in the collection of A. Cohn, Carson City, Nevada. The piece measures 84 inches high, is 12 inches wide, and 6 inches wide at the opening. The stitches number over 50,000, being thirty to the inch. The body color is a rich light gold, and the figures are in red and black. It weighs 16 ounces, and is valued at many hundreds of dollars. The figures on the basket represent birds migrating or flying away, the motto being, ‘** When the birds leave their nests and fly away, we shall move.” The shape of this piece and the quality of the sentiment in the markings are excelled only by the inimitable quality of the work on the surface. It is difficult to conceive of a more pertectly uniform piece of handiwork than this.
In pottery all vestiges of coiling and molds are commonly obliterated. Ina very few examples of ancient ware there seems to have been an aim to perfect the coiling and render its detail monotonous and artistic, but in the many thousands of other examples the potter has erased the marks of the fingers, the paddle, and the mold. On the other hand, the whole development of the art of basketry has been an effort to perfect the individual stitch, or mesh, or check, if necessary to make any number of thousands of them exactly alike over the entire surface of a large receptacle, or to study the greatest possible number of variations that may be given in form to these primary elements consistent with the unity of the whole effect. The Eskimo near the mouth of the Yukon must have only Jately acquired the art of basket making. With coarse hay for the foundation and sinew for thread they produce the clumsiest excuses for basketry, ugly in form, sloyenly in stitching, and utterly devoid of designs on the surface, while the Aleuts, close by, have unique elementary forms and work with surprising uniformity. With the monotony or uniformity of

<<<Page: 319>>>

the mosaic elements in any basket one must not fall into the error of thinking that there is not the greatest variety of fundamental shapes in the things to be monotonized. They vary in outline and relief in position with reference to the horizon; that is, the rim of the basket, in relative proportion to the whole and its parts.
In checkerwork the basketry tiles, one might call them, keeping in mind the use of the word mosaic, are squares or rectangles in close or open work. The mosaic of checkerwork pleases by its uniformity, and yet many baskets made by hand with tools not over refined have in them enough of variety to relieve them from the dull monotony in machine

oe ee between hard-wood splints and those of cedar bark and palm leaf, offers all the chance the weaver needs to play tricks in reliefs. The eye is never wearied in rambling up and down among these crooked paths. There is possibility of variety even in checkerwork, through changing the width of warp and weft elements. Oblong rectangles there mingle with tiny or larger squares in tessellated surfaces. (See Plate 14 and figs. 96 and 97.)

What is here said concerning the wsthetic effects produced in the plainest kind of checkerwork by simple alternation of the colors is illustrated by fig. 92, after Holmes in the Sixth Annual Report of.the Bureau of Ethnology already quoted.
Fig. 93 is a more interesting illustration from the Amazon region,

<<<Page: 320>>>

from a drawing after Frank H. Cushing. The surface of the basket is mosaic in two colors, made up of little square blocks, and by their alternation not only sloping and vertical patterns are produced, but the most intricate labyrinth of fretwork. There is no limit to the possibilities any more than there is to the Italian workman making a tessellated pavement with marble blocks in white and black.
As soon as the weaver steps outside of her monotonous checkerwork into the province of wicker, or especially twilled weaving, the possibilities of ornamentation are infinitely multiplied. In plain weave, wicker elements are sigmoid or spindle-shaped; on twilled weay-
ing, they are oblong rectangles. Passing into the most intricate damask effects in modern linen weaving, in which materials of one color
g, only have to be used, it will be seen how TWILLED WORK IN TWO ereatly varied this sort of ornamentation may eee
2 5 A After W. H. Holmes. be made. The elements of wickerwork mosaic
are horizontal, but twilled weaving, in single elements may be both vertical and horizontal in the same piece. The three accompanying figures are from Holmes and show better than words the possibilities of the little squares and rectangles for decoration. In fig. 94 in two colors the white work is under two and oyer one; the weft over one, two, or three and under one; the result being a series of sloping designs of great beauty. Fig. 95 in precisely the same materials shows how by varying the count the pattern is changed. Fig. 96 is interesting because it exhibits a widespread type of mat weaving farthest away from loom work. The woman begins at the corner to weave. All the little blocks are rectangles; all stop at the same angle, and the result is a perfect Greek fret in two colors. (See Plate 47.) In twined weaving the effect of the single Fic. 95. rows is funicular one way and corrugated DIAPER TWILLED worK IN Two the other. If the reader will notice any Ores a aes number of twined baskets in plain twined weave, it will at once become apparent that it has its limitations. The Pomo make only bands in it to represent the skin of a snake or some such motive. The Haida and Tlinkit vary the ribbed effect with decorative overlaying or three-strand weft. With the diagonal twined work the case is entirely different. The boldest of spiral designs covering an immense surface are wrought NAT MUS 1902 19

<<<Page: 321>>>

in weaving in twilled fashion. Nothing can excel the Pomo, Pit River, and other northern California carrying baskets in attractiveness of decoration. In openwork twining, where the warp has a chance to show its versatility, as in mound-builders’ ware, but especially in Aleutian wallets, the pleasing effects in a single color are without end. For examples of the great variety in twined-work decoration see Plates 19, 21, and 48.
Plate 48, illustrating twined decoration in its elements is a representation of food bowls of the Klamath Indians of southern Oregon, These old specimens were among the first received at the U. S. National Museum and were collected by George Gibbs, Cat. No. 7568, U.S.N.M. The resources of ornamentation used by the Klamath Indians are fine stems and rods for the fiber, different colors in the wood, and superadded elements for decoration. Much of their work

is done in soft material and in the type of overlaying used by them the ends are fastened off carelessly on the inside of the structure so as to give a rough appearance.
Further illustrations of Klamath ornamentation, as well as that of their kindred, the Modoes, will be found in Plates 167, 174.
One of the prettiest and boldest attempts at securing effects in twined weave in the U. S. National Museum is from the vast cemetery of Ancon in Peru. The illustration (fig. 97) shows the decorative — belt on a small workbasket made from rushes. One might be deceived into thinking that the motive came from the Yokut Indians of California (figs. 98 and 99), but a glance at the texture reveals a different method of achieving the same result. The warp is double, consisting of two straws side by side as in the Aleut wallets. At the bottom are three rows of plain twined weaving, each twist inclosing two warps.

<<<Page: 322>>>

Follow these pairs up to the top of the basket and note that the two rows of twined weaving—one dark, the other light—also inclose pairs, but not the same pairs, between the single twinings. Here seven human figures are woven in black on a brown ground. The pairs are holding in their hands between them a rhomboid object, reminding one of an Iroquois wampum belt in which two warriors are shown as lbearing the sacred pipe. The weaving on this space is twilled mixed ‘with twined, the latter being subservient to the former. The warp elements no longer are worked in pairs, but singly. The twined weaving on them is twilled on the brown body surface and vertical across the black rectangles, making the double warp conform to the twined weaving below everywhere save on the feet. All this is finger work and deserves a prize for its maker both for the plan and the size of the molecules.

Coiled basketry, on the contrary, is made up of radial elements only, which are the stitches, some being long and thin, others short and wide. The esthetic effects depend on the quality of the material. The very coarsest ware of the Utes and the Klondike nations has little beauty of texture, while that of the Alaskan Tinné or the California Washoe, Panamint, or Pomo is faultless. In finer coiled work, when the stitches barely interlock, they appear to stand one over another from row to row; but when the stitches pass underneath one of the rods at least of the foundation below there is an alternation of stitches with open spaces on the surface resembling twilled weaving, each one being wedged between two, over and under. It is impossible to trace any ornamentation in coiled work among the eastern Indians of North

<<<Page: 323>>>

America through lack of material. The Arctic Alaskan coiled basketry also is lacking in color features. It is not until the Salish tribes of British Columbia are reached that attempts are made to produce beautiful effects in the primitive coiled elements of ornamentation. The resources of the artist are fourfold.
(1) Her regular stitches are in tough root splints coiled in such manner that the smooth outer surface of the last year’s growth is exposed to view. Seldom will the rough inner splints which constitute the

foundation come into sight through or between the stitches, Indeed, there is a type of weaving in this area in which smooth, thin strips of wood are laid together in pairs so that when the warp is exposed it is the bright outer surface that is seen. The Salish woman is not backward in making most of her opportunities with the dull brown color of the cedar in that she has learned to practice uniformity in the stitches themselves.
(2) Mention has already been made of splitting stitches in the sew

ing of these savage women. It is done in such a careful manner that it becomes an element of beauty, otherwise it would become a contribution to ugliness. Examples of this work will be seen in Plate 24.
(3) Another resource of ornamentation in the elementary American work of coiled basketry has been well used by the Salish Indians— that is the so-called beading, which consists in running a strip of bright grass in and out among the coiled stitches at regular intervals. Many examples of brown cedar sewing with bright golden-colored straws for the beading are in the U. 5S. National Museum. This arrests the radial effect of the coil stitches and substitutes the concentric or parallel motif.

(4) The last elementary resource referred to among the Salish tribe is imbrication, which will be more minutely described in the section devoted to color in ornamentation. The sewing on such specimens is entirely obliterated and the surface reconstructed in yellow, red, brown, and wood color, the effect being tesselate mosaic.
Among the California tribes these coiled elements, being much smaller in size than those in the baskets of the Salish tribes, afforded | opportunity for different artistic effects. An inspection of the work done by Pomo, Maidu, and other tribes of northern California shown in many plates and figures will prove this.
Fig. 98 is from the surface of a beautiful coiled basket of the Tulare Indians, Tulare County, California. It gives an opportunity of studying the elementary stitches on the best of coiled work. These Indians

<<<Page: 325>>>

have at their command four colors, that of the root or wood with which the body of the basket is sewed; black filaments taken from the root of a peculiar sedge; where the redbud or cercis is available, the outer bark is a rich brown and the inner side quite white; in addition there is a bright reddish root, Yucca arborescens.
The stitches are, of course, hexagonal in form, but the pressing of the wood together gives them quite an oval outline, and they naturally, in the course of sewing, incline toward the right. With these colors and oval elements to which the artist is bound to restrict herself, the attempt is here made to produce a step-formed cycloid. In the spaces between each two designs is the figure of a man. It is interesting to note how, under such narrow restrictions, so good effects can be produced.
In southern California among the Tulare and other neighboring tribes, as well as among the Apache and Navaho, most pretentious figures are attempted in coiled elements. Fig. 99, after Holmes, in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology (fig. 339) furnishes a good example of what is here mentioned, but the farthest departure from old-fashioned types is exhibited in the work of the Apaches, who attempt all sorts of animal forms in

Plate 49 shows two covered jars in exquisite coiled work, brought from Santa Barbara, California, by William Alden Gale, of Boston, between 1810 and 1835, and owned by the Misses Eaton.

They are introduced here for the purpose of calling attention to their combination of esthetic qualities. One does

<<<Page: 326>>>

not know which to admire most, their forms, the fineness of the stitches, the simple but effective designs, or the charming effect of color both in the patterns and in the mosaic work. Covers on baskets from this area are rare and may not be ancient. It is just suggested that their motive came from the old preserve jars common in ships’ outfits a hundred years ago.
In fig. 100 the ornamentation has all the features of lacework; indeed, it might be called the beginning of lace. The detailed drawing above the figure shows, however, that the example is simply : piece of coiled basketry from which the foundation rows have been carefully withdrawn and only the sewing remains. In the long stitches between the thread has been simply wrapped twice around the standing part instead of once. It is within the weaver’s power to make this change at any moment from single wrap to double wrap, the result being a figured surface, as in the lower drawing. This sort of ornamentation has rare existence north of the present boundaries of Mexico, but may be found all through tropical America. The example here shown was procured from the Pima Indians of the Piman family in Arizona and Mexico, but beautiful examples were also collected by W J McGee among the Papagoes, their kindred.
The fundamental checks, decussations, stitches, and meshes of which the mosaic of basketry is made up are used, associated or not with color, in forming designs or patterns on the surface. Compare the severely plain Haida cylinder wallet with the exquisitely decorated hat from the same tribe. Both are in the color of the spruce root, but the latter resembles fine lacework on account of the delicate pattern coyering its surface. All Indian tribes know how to give variety to unity by simply making up various technical compositions that add no new processes. These compositions are aggregations of simple forms which are the alphabet of the Indian woman’s most intricate patterns. It matters not how complicated the whole design may be, it is composed of the following simple parts:
(a) Lines in ornament.
(6) Squares or rectangles.
(ce) Rhomboidal figures.
(d) Triangles.
(e) Polygonal elements.
(7) Complex patterns.
It may be well to devote a little more space to the consideration of these. Many seemingly incomprehensible patterns become clear when resolved. At the same time the secret of their pleasure-giving quality is revealed. Just as a subtle pleasure creeps into the mind in scrutinizing the uniform stitches on the surface of the Washoe basket (Plate

<<<Page: 327>>>

46) so, in a higher sense, the orderly recurring of the same geometric shape over and over in an intricate design adds to the enjoyment of the whole. These elements are not exact, however, being hand-made and bounded by lines produced by the curved forms in most basketry. The artistic effect is thus heightened.
(a) Lines in ornament.—It may not have occurred to the reader to observe how scrupulous almost every Indian basket maker is to relieve the monotony of her work by a simple line of some other kind of weaving. It would be safe to say that no basket is without them. In the entire Hudson collection in the National Museum there is not a twined basket whose texture is not improved in more than one place by a line in a different style of technic. These lines may run in almost any direction, and, as in the Haida hat, be worked into geometric figures.
Plate 50 is a collection of Pima basket bowls from southern Arizona belonging to F. M. Covert, of New York city. It shows how many different effects are produced in the same tribe by the mere administration of lines wandering about. In some of the figures shown it will be seen how easy it is for a row of stitches to become double and then to add or to make additional rows at the ends or on the sides, to separate lines or to give to a line any sort of curved effect. This is especially noticeable in fig. 8. The line may pass by further additions into rectangles, triangles, or geometric figures. The Indians of the southwestern portion of the United States have exhausted the situation in this matter of meandering lines.
(4) Squares or rectangles.—The next simplest form upon which the basket artist may venture is the square or rectangle, which may be a band of two or more rows interrupted by vertical spaces, perhaps in another color. It is a matter of counting the same number over and over as the work progresses, and is one of the first steps in arithmetic. In a Pomo gift basket the square patterns on the bottom are the mats on the floor, and so the simplest of weaving motives lends itself to svmbolism. In the plainest forms of work the checkers or squares are oriented at right angles to the horizon or border of the specimen. Variety is effected by the position of the squares and their relation one to another and to other decorative elements. A delightful effect is produced on matting especially where the squares or checkers are oblique to the borders. Such work is to be seen in America, but was much more common in the islands of the Pacific.
The rectangle gives a wider scope still to variety in artistic effects. Bands of rectangles are to be seen around basketry, and more complicated forms are made up of them or have them in their composition. A departure from the rectangle, but in the same line of workmanship, is the parallelogram. Such work is easily produced in the diagonal or twilled weaving. An excellent example of an intricate design made up

<<<Page: 328>>>

of rectangles in various positions and relations one to another is shown in the old Skokomish wallet from Washington in the collection of F. Harvey. (See Plate 51.) The decorations on this wallet consist of vertical collections of geometric figures, one hanging from another, in suits of four. Each one of the designs which go to make up the whole decoration in its simplest elements is a rectangle. The projections from the sides of these are the same, and the wolves around the upper border are simply a collection of the same elementary design, the head, the neck, the body, the legs, the tail, each one is the same. On the larger rectangles are nests of geometric figures of the same class, one inclosed in the other by widening lines. The entire effect on the surface is produced by the clever use of a single element.
In many examples, when the rectangular figure is set obliquely the pattern on the basket appears to have a rhomboidal form. The types of weaving have much to do with the administration of the rectangle, whether it be radial or concentric. In diagonal weaving the long axis is horizontal, but in coiled work the long, slender rectangles are perpendicular. In loose coiling the figures become rhomboidal on account of the longer slope of the stitch. Twined work produces an infinite number of rhombs in rows having ragged edges. In the style of weaving produced by the Makah the separate elements are rectangular on the inside, but they form a charming patchwork of rhombs on the outside. The rectangle aside from color, which will be studied later, lends itself to ornament by its relief, its proportions, and its position. The relief depends on the material, which may be soft inner bark or bast, or pliant leaves. On the other hand, it may be soft fillets of ash and stems of willow or coarse brushes as in the fish weir. When the projecting elements are intractable the possibilities of plain geometric ornamentation are limited in the extreme, but with fibers highly flexible and well-soaked materials the field of the decorator becomes greatly enlarged.
Plate 52, a large bottle-shaped granary of the San Carlos Apache Indians belonging to the fine collection of F. S. Plimpton, of San Diego, California, shows what is meant by proportion. Upon the surface of this coiled basket will be found stepped patterns rising in a cycloids from the bottom to the neck and even to the rim of the specimen. Each one of these spaces is covered with black and white rectangles, or as near as rectangular forms can be made on a globular surface governed in length and width by the widening or narrowing of the specimen. In the spaces between these patterns so made up are men and horses, but even these have square heads, bodies, lees, and feet. The fingers on the men are in proper shape. An amusing departure is manifest in the effort to give a little shape to the tails and ears of the horses.
(c) Rhomboidal figures. —With the parallelogram or rhomb, the

<<<Page: 329>>>

surface of the basket has a tessellated or mosaic appearance. These figures also may be oriented with reference to the borders, but the patterns become oblique, and more pleasing diaper effects are caused when the figures are not oriented with reference to the horizon or border. Plate 53 shows a number of beautiful bowls in the collection of C. P. Wilecomb from Kern, Inyo, and Tulare counties, California. They are introduced here for the purpose of showing how, on many of them, diamond-shaped patterns have been worked into basketry with excellent effect. Associated with these geometric form polygons are also the elements of cycloids, covering almost the entire surface. Radiating from the bottom, triangular spokes proceed to the outer margin and these are decorated with diamond patterns and irregular polygons. The human form and other typical patterns are united with those now under consideration. The majority of the decoration, however, is in the simple elementary geometric shape here considered.
(2) Triangles.—On the surface of basketry the triangle, as an element of design in mosaic, does not occur in the single stitch or check, but it is found in open-work basketry, as among the Aleuts, where the warp is bent backward and forward or crossed. By the combination of elementary parts triangular effects in great variety are obtained. In this technic a triangle is not a three-sided figure with straight outline, but a pyramid made by piling up rectangles, vertical or radial in coiled basketry, horizontal or concentric in woven basketry. The base of the triangle may be straight but the sides are notched and stepped as in the bead work.
A great many symbolical designs of arrowheads, mountains, and other artificial and natural objects which suggest the three-sided form are produced on both coiled and woven basketry, the base of the triangle being at the top, at the bottom, or on either side of the figure. The conical or the globular basket lends itself most cheerfully to this element in design. On cylindrical, and especially on vertical vasiformed basketry, for ornamental effects the triangle easily passes into curved figures of infinite variety. After the foundation of the figure is laid on a certain round of weaving or coiling it is possible on the next round to widen or narrow above either end of this line. In some examples a sweeping cycloid beginning at the base, narrows and curves to the right or left, terminating with the outer border. The Filipino hat makers are exceedingly fond of creating a series of these triangle cycloids in different colors, some of them turning to the right, others to the left. The California basket maker also produces flame-like effects with elongated triangles. There seems to be no end to the versatility of this figure on globular basketry.
Plate 54 represents two of the Tulare bowls in the collection of F. 8. Plimpton. The upper figure, especially, shows in its bands of

<<<Page: 330>>>

decoration in brown and black how the rhomb and triangle cooperate to produce regular and pleasing decoration. The lower figure is a better illustration of the use of narrow parallelograms, combined in lines concentric and radial, to give expression to phenomena such as lightning.
Plate 55 is an imbricated box from the Fraser River country, in British Columbia. Excepting the parallel bands, the front and body of the basket are covered with white and dark-brown triangles, no other elementary geometric figure being introduced. Each triangle is an example of the limitations before mentioned, which practically cut the basket maker off from free-hand drawing. The geometricians say that a circle is a polygon with an infinite number of sides. With them all curved lines resolve themselves into the rectilinear. The basket maker does not stop there, but resolves rectilinear forms into still minuter rectilinear forms of another class. The mosaic elements on the basket are most regular squares of imbrication. There is for her no other way to make a triangle. This specimen is in the collection of F. Harvey.
(e) Polygonal elements. —What has been said of the triangle is also true of polygonal figures-—that is, of those having more than four sides. These figures may be produced in the texture of baskets in openwork. They are also brought about by uniting different forms of checks or stitches in the same piece of work. On the hats of the Haida Indians and on twined work of the Pacific coast excellent diaper patterns are woven. In closely packed basketry the individual stitches assume the form of the hexagon, after the manner of the bee’s cell. On matting, wallets, bags—that is, on flat surfaces—all of the geometric figures before mentioned having straight borders occur. In many rhombs the ends are cut off by boundary lines of bands and turned into hexagons.
However, as soon as basketry begins to assume curved outlines, borders that would be straight ona flat surface are bent in one or more directions. The effect of this, both in the single mosaic element and in the larger designs, is to change the figure from a hard outline to one that is far more graceful. Ina coiled basket the foundation coil is curved horizontally, but the stitches cross these at right angles. In a coiled bowl with globose bottom there are three sets of curves with different radii—the horizontal curve of the foundation, the curve of the pattern, and the vertical curves of the stitches. The shapes of polygons that may be worked on the surface of basketry are legion. The designs which may be made out of these are even more numerous. It will be possible to illustrate only a limited number of them, but the reader may be pleased to turn from plate to plate in the decorations on the surface of basketry in the various chapters to see how versatile the Indian woman’s mind was in

<<<Page: 331>>>

making the best of her limitations. Being confined to angular elements, having no opportunity to introduce the curve, except so far as the body of the basket itself made straight lines curved, it became necessary to rack her ingenious brain to satisfy her cravings for expression of the beautiful with straight lines only. (See Plates 56-59.)
(7) Complea patterns. —The most striking artistic effects in basketry are realized when the simple lines, bands, and geometric figures are united and modified to suit the weaver’s fancy, to fit the general shape of the object, and oftentimes to correct a miscalculation on the part of the maker. The effect of lines is changed by breaking, curving, setting at different angles, widening, and coloring. Geometric figures become subsidiary to and are lost in mythological compositions, but they are the organic parts of the whole design.
Plate 60 will illustrate what is here said about the production of intricate designs by combining two or more of the separate elements in the foregoing paragraphs. In every one of the bowls shown in this plate a circular form in basket work is attained by using material of the same color in the coiling at the bottom. From these central beginnings designs in triangles, squares, rectangles, and polygons are built up into labyrinthian decorations for the whole surface. In the middle figure of the bottom row five patterns radiate from the central cirele, each one of which is made up of three groups of rectangular figures in black and white. Specimens are in the collection of J. W. Benham.
Plate 61 will interest the student as an example of bold design, being the American eagle, with expanded wings. It will surprise him to note how, with the use of straight-line figures before mentioned, some little life is given to the neck and to the talons of the bird by the fine marking of stitches, which lend themselyes somewhat to curved effects. It can not be said, however, that this treatment is a success.
Quite as much as form, the colors in basketry are an element of beauty. As in basket forms the sense of pleasure is awakened by the ‘mass, by the minute elements, and by the shape of patterns or designs, so it is with colors. One does not know which to admire the most— the subdued shades of the natural materials, the pretty effects of the infinite variety of hues in the stitches, or the combinations of patterns in ornamentation through colors furnished by Nature’s laboratory, which the importunate Indian women of America have secured in their tireless quest. The gamut of shades runs from pure white through the yellows and browns to sooty black, and age only ripens the effects. The peculiar golden shade of an old piece from California will set the connoisseur’s face aglow. No doubt a part of this admiration springs from association of ideas such as age, rareness, the seeming disparity between the maker and her art, and, maybe, the pride of ownership.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. Su
When it is remembered that for utilitarian purposes merely not one speck of this artistic coloring is needed, and further noted that great fatigue and search and critical judgment are necessary in order to acemple materials for a single basket, surely no one will withhold admiration from the creator of colored ornamentation in basketry One can scarcely begin to appreciate her struggles and triumphs until the effort is made to reproduce her results.
Ornamentation by means of color is effected in basketry through the following processes, already hinted at in the chapter on basket making:
(a) By employing materials which are of different colors by nature. This has been partly described in the foregoing sections.
(2) By the use of dyed materials.
(c) By overlaying the weft and w arp with thin strips of pretty materials before weaving or by wrapping strips about them in various ways.
(7) By embroidering on the texture during the process of manufacture, called false embroidery.
(e) By covering the texture with plaiting, called imbrication.
(7) By adding feathers, shells, beads, and other ornamental objects.
In the making of designs on basketry, dyeing, overlaying, false embroidery, sine imbrication are merely artificial methods of repeating and heightening the decorative effects already shown to be possible fhrough use of materials i in their native colors. No new designs are added, symbolical or otherwise. The effect of new forms in elementary technic has already beenmentioned. But the artist obtains an immense advantage in the number of colors as well as the richness of shades and harmonies. After all, excepting in California, there are only a few colors in tough fibers to select from in any area. If it were not for pretty grasses which have brilliancy of color, but little tenacity, and the bright dyes in mineral and vegetal substances which have no value as textiles, the wsthetic power of basketry would be greatly curtailed. There are two or three small linguistic families of Indians in California that seem to have gathered unto themselves every kind of basket decoration. As in the island of Crete the culture of the ancient peoples about the eastern Mediterranean seem to have assembled, so in the Pomo and Mariposan tribes of Indians the composite art reached its climax of decoration. Is it not marvelous that here hundreds of years ago, perhaps, broke out the first basketry epidemic; not as now resulting in a fever to own them merely, but manifesting itself in a passion for making them. In the chapter on uses it will be seen that this passion was intimately related to the most sacred feelings that dwelt in the soul of the maker, namely, those associated with the spirit world. It is also true that ine natural materials for other forms of art expression were lacking or not courted.
(a) Ln natural materials.—Color in basketry is effected, first, by the

<<<Page: 333>>>

materials from which the structure is made up. In the Aleutian Islands the ware is in the color of the wild grass stalks, unripe and ripe; farther south the spruce root decides the shade, and in British Columbia cedar root and bast and bark give a brown or white appearance to the ware. In eastern Canada ash splints are white and brown; so are the baskets made therefrom, but the cane of the Southern States has a glossy yellow-green surface, and that predominates in Cherokee and Choctaw ware.
Among the bewildering varieties of baskets between British Columbia and Mexico the foundation colors will be decided by that of the Indian hemp, spruce and cedar root, bulrushes, cattail stems, shoots of willow and rhus, roots of sedges and agave, roots of yucca, and so on.
In this connection it must not be overlooked that these same materials are not lacking in responsiveness to the severest esthetic demands of the artist. The Abenaki woman knows that last year’s growth of black ash is almost as white as snow, while the rings of growth farther in are brown. She therefore makes warp of one and weft of the other, or bands of them alternately, much to the embellishment of the surface. The commonest fishwoman on the coast of British Columbia will show you that cedar root has three colors—that of the woody portion, the brown of the outer bark, and the newest wood nearest to the bark. She also knows how to overlay with grasses. The California cercis, or red bud, has a pretty reddishbrown bark, but the wood inside is pure white. Remarkable suggestiveness to a wide-awake mind exists in the yucca leaf of the Southwest, which may be used in basketry, whole or split. The outside is mottled green in a number of shades, while the inside is white. The leaf of the yucca (Yucca arborescens) is green, the root a reddish brown.
Holmes calls attention to the possibilities of esthetic effects in a single color shown in a workbasket from the ancient cemetery of Ancon, Peru, produced through variety in the management of diagonal weaving. There will be found on all these workbaskets (1) ordinary diagonal weaving, over and under two or three or more; (2) bands of greater or less width formed by laying a piece of wood or cane between warp and weft and then continuing the weaving on the other side; (3) the forming of hinges and ridges by twining in each weft element about two or three warps before continuing the weaving. The herringbone effects are produced by leaving in front alternately warp and weft in the padded bands. If the number of rows of common diagonal weaving is even, a herringbone effect is seen; if odd, the checks in the two rows will be parallel. In Mexico and Central America the valuable yuccas give color to al] textiles, as do the palm leaves in South America. (See figs. 207-209.)

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. oue
It is said that the Japanese in sawing up logs will keep the planks bound together until the workman is ready to use them, and when the carpenter places them in a ceiling or a piece of furniture he is careful to have the ends abut on each other as they were together in nature. The grain, in such case, fits and produces odd but pleasing forms. In the same way the basket maker, by showing discretion and taste with roots or stems of different shades, succeeds in producing cloud effects upon the basket or mat. So nature comes in to the assistance of the Indian woman in her elementary steps. She does not start out with the design in her mind which she will produce in color, but by using the colored elements she is able to get her effect with less forethought. Indeed, it can be seen that in such a way the earliest thoughts of beauty might have been awakened.
Plate 62 shows two coiled Mission baskets in the collection of G. Wharton James; the upper one is 10 inches and the lower one 114 inches in diameter. They are made of rush, but the interesting feature for which they are introduced here is the design—the upper figure might be called the keystone pattern, the body of the bowl having two zones of patterns in brown and black material, each one made up of wedge-shaped figures, narrow on the inside and widening outward. These patterns are in four parts, each one surmounted by a middle piece extending two rows beyond the next pair and each pair ot the series ending two rows nearer to the center. They are of equal width. A narrow wedge separates the four groups. Between the zones is a band of white preserving the outline of the border. The lower figure is a five-pointed star, the border of the segments being curved as in the orange-peel pattern. The central figure might be called a sun design, which, though it be modern, shows the adaptability of the Indian mind to invasion by suggestion.
A second step in color resources, without going away from the natural and necessary structural elements, is in the use of different materials. Very few areas in the Western Hemisphere are so poor in resources as to have only one good basketry plant. On the Great Lakes ash, hemp, and sweet grass are white, brown, and green; in the Southwest rhus is white and martynia is black; in California willow is woody white; cercis is red outside and snow-white inside, and at least one sedge has black root, and the yueca a red one. Most dainty effects are secured in coiled basketry by sewing with strips from quills of flickers and other highly colored birds. Not to pursue the statement too far, it is only in Alaska and the Straits of Magellan that the body of our textile does not contain varied material.
The moment a savage woman has in hand these variegated substances her fancy is emancipated. Warp may be of one plant and weft of another, either in plain checker or in twilled weaving. Wickerwork is not entirely irresponsive to the opportunity. In twined weaving

<<<Page: 335>>>

the two strands of the weft may differ in color, so that the result will be the mottled line. If the warp stems be odd in number, then on the next round the colors on vertical lines will not match. With these simple resources the basket-maker may play an unlimited number of melodies. An excellent example of lines in simple and two-color effects from southeastern Alaska is shown in colored plate 67.
But the ambitious artist is not satisfied with flecked lines and mottled surfaces, and broad bands in one color. Her bands are divided into rectangles, triangles, and rhomboidal elements. The zones of element are widened and the geometric patterns composing them are multiplied and variegated. Those who have large collections may have noticed how the several styles of technic behave in this regard. Checkerwork is little restrained, so also are wicker and twilled ornamentation; but in twined and coiled ware the case is entirely different. Plain twine and the Pomo tee work venture little beyond the banded ornament. The same is true of most coil types; but the twilled or diagonal-twined work and the three-rod coil leap over the parallels and spread themselves out in bewildering cycloids of colored patterns, or, keeping to the angular elements, the weaver covers a large surface with fretwork in endless variety. All of this is wrought into the structure of the basket in the substantial everyday material, which possess tenacity and color as well. Quite a number of tribes in the southwestern United States use no superadded material or dyes whatever, and yet the tribes of the Piman family excel all others in the endless variety of fretwork on their basketry produced with splints in wood color and the undyed splints from the pod of the cat’s claw, or Martynia louisiana. (See Plate 63.)
(6) By dyeing.—The colors of natural textile materials were still further diversified with dyes and paints, the latter either stamped, stenciled, or applied freehand. At the present time the cheap and obtrusive dyes and paints of the trades supplant the aboriginal and more attractive substances. The latter have also become more difficult to procure as civilization has preempted the ground.
The artificial coloration of basketry material was known to the American savages in pre-Columbian times. For mineral dyes they use earth colors, burying the splints in different soils, where they acquired permanent shades. Vegetable dyes were known from Alaska southward everywhere. The substances used were such as have the power of directly fixing themselves within the texture of the basket material. It is true and also interesting to note that certain of the processes of the Indians in dyeing their basketry materials were, all unconsciously to them, foreshadowings of the later and more complicated processes in which a mordant is employed to fix the dyestuff in the materials. The Indian had no knowledge of the effects produced. They discovered the fact, but their theories would lead into dreamy

<<<Page: 336>>>

myths in which the personeity of the dyestuff would be the prominent characteristic.
Plate 64 shows twilled basket No. 76778, U.S.N.M., from the New Orleans Centennial Commission. It is a basket of the Chetimacha Indians of Louisiana made in split cane in the natural color and dyed. The union of textile effects and the three colors—orange, black, and straw color—-are most pleasing, the motive being ellipsis and rhombs made by the use of small squares and rectangles. The upper portion of the figure also shows how a diaper effect may be produced on the surface by the lights and shades of the uncolored material.
It is useless to tarry about the eastern basket makers in search of native dyes. There is no doubt of their having possessed them. The poreupine-quill workers about the Great Lakes and all the way to the Arctic circle are still adepts in the art. In the National Museum are little wallets of bladder from Anderson River, Canada, each one filled with poreupine quills dyed in a separate color.
The basket weavers of Yakutat Bay, in southeastern Alaska, color their splints of spruce root from which they weave their twined basketry with dye from the willow. They scrape the roots of willow and make a decoction in a wooden tub in which they soak the spruceroot splints. Their neighbors of the same linguistic family had a more extensive laboratory in color. For more than a hundred years they were in contact with the Russians and from them obtained good dye-stuffs and knowledge of processes. Many an old piece of their basket ware, although it has stood hard use in all the years and in spite of all, has grown more beautiful with age.
Plate 65 shows two covered baskets of the Tlinkit Indians in twined work which are inserted here for the purpose of exhibiting the influence of modern traffic. Cesar in bis Commentaries speaks of the Belgians as being the most manly of all the Gallic tribes, because merchants less frequently went among them and sold them the things that tended toward effeminating their minds. The Mercatores have also been among the tribes of the Northwest. On the right-hand basket even the bands that would show some little survival of the ancient wood color have been dyed, while the red, yellow, black, and white shades are in aniline. The form of these baskets is also borrowed from civilization, and the handles in braided ware are not aboriginal. Cat. Nos. 168267, 168268.
The wood of the alder, when freshly cut, says Swan,“ is soft and white and easily worked, but a short exposure to the air hardens and turns it toa red color. The bark chewed and spit into a dish forms a bright-red dye pigment of a permanent color, which is used for dyeing

cedar bark or grass. Governor Dagget, writing of the Indian women on the Hupa reservation in northwestern California, uses almost precisely the same language with reference to making a dye pot of their mouths. The processes of weaving there are in twined work and suggest connection with the Washington state tribes.
The Navaho Indians, according to Washington Matthews, employ native dyes of yellow, reddish, and black. In their blankets they have also wool of three different natural colors, white, rusty black, and gray. The black dye is made from the twigs and leaves of aromatic sumac (Rhus trilobata ). They put into a pot of water leaves and branches of the sumac. The water is allowed to boil five or six hours. Ocher is reduced to a fine powder and slowly roasted over a fire until it assumes ¢ light-brown color. It is then combined with an equal quantity of Pifion eum (Pinus edulis), and again the mixture is placed upon the fire and stirred. The gum melts and the mass assumes a mushy consistency. As the roasting progresses the mass is reduced to a fine black powder. When it has cooled it is thrown into the decoction of sumac, with which it forms a rich; blue-black fluid. This is essentially an ink, the tanmic acid of the sumae combining with the iron of the ferric oxide in the roasted ocher. The whole is enriched by the carbon of the calcined gum.
Reddish dye is made from the bark of the Aldnus tenuzfolia and the bark and root of Cercocarpus parvifolius, the mordant being fine juniper ashes. These dyes are now applied by the Navaho. The so-called Navaho blankets are in three colors.
For yellow the flowering tops of Chrysothammnus graveolens are boiled about six hours, until a decoction of deep yellow is produced. The dyer then heats over the fire some native alunogen (native alum) until it is reduced to a pasty consistency. This she adds to the decoction and puts the whole in the dye to boil. From time to time a portion is inspected until it is seen to have assumed the proper color. The tint produced is nearly lemon yellow.
Julian Scott makes the statement that the Coconinos or Havasupais in northwestern Arizona use only black in the ornamentation of their basketry, while the Apaches and Wallapais use black and red also.
(c) By overlaying.—This process of ornamentation consists in laying a strip of pretty grass, dyed or in the natural color, on the outside of one or both the strands in woven or coiled weaving. It is virtually furnishing a dull-brown strip of root with a bright-colored bark. By this ingenious combination beauty and strength cooperate in the result. The weaver has it always in her power to twist the strand so as to hide this bark side or bring it into view. The Hupa Indians especially, but many other tribes in northern California and northward, do the weft of their beautiful twined weaving in somber materials. The men are most adept in lining the backs of their bows

<<<Page: 338>>>

with sinew shredded and mixed in glue. Ina similar way, as though one had suggested the other, they line the back of the weft str: ands with bright straw. It is not glued, since the weaving would hold it in place. Whenthe Hupa reveals the straw side of the strand at every half turn, she covers the surface of her basket with straw color which turns to gold with age. The overlaying of only one of the two weft strands gives a freckled effect on the surface. In some of the tribes the pattern does not show on the inside.
This will be a good place in which to mention a kind of overlaying common in countries where the cane abounds. The outside of the stem is glossy and may be dyed. The inside is spongy and unattractive. By laying two strips together, so that the smooth surface may be outward, there would be really a double fabric with two elossy surfaces. The southern Indians also frequently passed only one of the pair of splints over or under weaving.

angles of darker material. The white squares run diagonally across the surface. There are endless variations produced by this wrapping added to the body of the fabric.
This overlaying must not be confounded with the many tricks which cunning women play with the strands of the regular twined weaving, which are frequently of brilliant straws of squaw grass and other pretty materials. (See Plates 146, 164, 170, 177 and 178.)
Plate 66 represents twined basketry of the Klamath River Indians of yarious types, and is here introduced for the purpose of showing how the tough weaving material may be overlaid with basketry and other colored filaments so as to conceal the foundation both outside and inside. It has been shown in the chapter on processes, however, that the exposure of the overlaying material need not occur on dhe

Akin to the ** beading,” so common in the Fraser River coiled basketry to be mentioned, is an ornamental effect produced in twined work by the onlaying of colored straws in regular geometrical designs and catching the angle under the strand of the weft. Holmes“ figures an example of this from the Klamath Indians in northwestern California, a rare process in North American Indian basketry. (See fig. 102.) It reminds one of the stamps for printing tapa cloth used in the Polynesian area.
Beading is the insertion of narrow strips of pretty grass or other material into the sewing of coiled baskets, passing it under one, over the next, and so on. Plain beading produces a broken line of dark and light color alternating, and shifts the direction of the elemental figure from vertical to horizontal. If several rows are made, figures are produced by the process of twilled weaving. The basket maker may pass her filament over and under as many stitches as she chooses; she may make the elements of any row immediately over those of the preceding row, or

cated baskets. Especially on the ware whose coils have flat foundations is beading effective. (See fig. 103.)
(d) False embroidery.—This is a method of ornamentation in which the outer surface of a twined basket is covered wholly or in part with designs, but they do not show on the inside. The Tlinkits excel in this, calling it uh tah yark tu twage (outside lifted up and put around). It has the appearance of being sewed on after the weaving is done. The process is described on the next page, and many figures in this paper show examples of it. Plates 71 and 74, in color, demonstratemore plainly how effective false embroidery may be made. The body of all Tlinkit and Haida ware is in dull-brown shade of spruce root. The saving feature which lends itself cheerfully to ornamentation is the pliability and even fiber of the young roots. Nothing can be more pleasing to the eye than a fine old Haida hat, its surface covered with intricate patterns. The Tlinkit false embroidery in subdued colors, yellow, red, and black, contrasts harmoniously with the cinnamon-

brown spruce root. Also the restful manner in which this work changes the slope of the elements in the weaving should not be overlooked. The twined weaving is made up of a series of little mosaic elements lying down one upon another like a row of bricks that have

fallen. The incline of the stitches in false embroidery is in the opposite direction. In Plate 67 charming effects are produced by alternating the plain weaving and the embroidery. (Emmons.)
The twined false embroidery might be classed technically with three strand twined weaving. (See figs. 29, 31, and 104.) The warp is in normal position. The weaver selects three strands for weft, two of spruce root and one of brightly coloredgrass. They all have their places in the weaving, but the third, or decorative element, instead of taking its turn to pass behind the warp, remains on the outside and makes ADAK L000 GNG a wrap about the strand that sane happens to be there. The Se eae wrapping may pass, also, over two by skipping every alternate twist of the warp. The Thompson Indians vary the mode of wrapping by passing a strip of corn husk or other soft material entirely around the twining each time, showing the figure on the inside.

<<<Page: 341>>>

(e) Lmbrication.—This term, derived from the Latin imbrex, a tile, is applied to a style of decoration used in Washington and British Columbia by the Klkitat and many of the Salish tribes, and most closely allied in technic with the feather work on basketry farther south. Leaves of Xerophyllum tenax, strips of wild cherry bark or of the inner bark of the cedar, in natural color or dyed black, are laid over the sewing of the coiled work. The juice of the Oregon grape is used to produce a bright yellow dye. The separate elements of the imbrication are squares or rectangles, varying in size with the fineness of the workmanship. But the mosaic effect is most striking, and designs of intricate character are successfully expressed in it. The Salish tribes about the Fraser mouth have learned to widen the coils by using thin strips of wood, often half an inch wide, as foundation of the coil. This increases the size of the imbrications and of the patterns. (See page 254 and Plate 68, also Plates 11, 48, 45, and 55.)
Ornamentation in Thompson River basketry is produced by imbrication and by beading (for detail drawing see figs. 52 and 53 and Plate 102). Imbrication is done by bringing the piece of grass over the outside of the last stitch and forward, then doubling it back and catching the double end with the next stitch. The outsides of Klikitat, Cowlitz, and Thompson baskets are completely covered in this manner, so that the whipped cedar splints can only be seen from the inside. Lillooet baskets have the lower part of the body plain, while the Chilcotin baskets have a separate band in the middle of the body. The grass used is that called Nho’itlexin. It is long, very smooth, and of a glossy yellow-white color (Xerophyllum tenax). To make it whiter diatomaceous earth is sometimes spread over it and it is then beaten with a flat stick ona mator skin. The grass is seldom dyed, as the colors are said to fade soon. (Teit.)
(7) Feather-work, beads, etc.—The California baskets adorned with feathers are called jewels. They no longer serve vulgar uses. The beautiful productions covered with styles of ornamentation before described have often the marks of fire, the stain of berries, the smell of fish about them, proclaiming that they were not above combining the beautiful with the useful. The feather baskets sacrifice use to beauty.
The tribes of eastern America have not employed feathers in basket work in recent times. The nearest approach to it is the porcupinequill work of the Indians in Canada and the United States. The quills are dyed and set on the surface of birch baskets by thrusting the sharp ends into the bark. The old historians tell of gorgeous feather robes made doubtless in the Indian fashion of twined weaving, which is akin to basketry. The Eskimo, Aleut, Haida, and Tlinkit do not ornament baskets with feathers, but they do apply in dainty fashion to some of them worsted, hair, and furs. Neither do the tribes of the Fraser

Columbia area. It is the California tribes chiefly that have developed the art, of which they practice two styles. In the one tiny bits of colored feather are sewed by their shafts to coiled basketry just to give a hazy effect to the surface. Plate 70 is an excellent example of this. It will be observed that the elaborate pattern in black is not obscured in the least by the feather. In the other process the feathers are iaid one upon another so thickly that the surface of the basket is hidden. The addition of so much extraneous matter thickens the foundation and coarsens the work. As previously remarked the best examples of coiled sewing are not to be found in the feathered baskets.
Plate 69 is a colored illustration of a feathered basket of the Pomo Indians from Sonoma County, California, in the collection of C. P. Wileomb. It is examples such as these that technically are called jewels. The foundation is a three-rod coil, the sewing is with split sedge root (Carex barbarex), and the stems of the feathers are caught under the stitches. The feathers on this rare specimen are as follows:
Red—W oodpecker (Melanerpr Ss. form /COVOTUS) «
Green—Mallard duck (Anas boschas).
Orange—Oriole (Leterus bulloch//).
Yellow— Meadow lark (Sturnella neglecta).

Plate 70 is a feathered jewel basket of the Upper Lakes, who are Pomo Indians, in Lake County, California. The stitches are of the coiled work over three rods and interlocked beneath. The yellow feathers are from the breast of Jushil, the meadow lark (Sturnella neglecta); the red ones are the throat and scalp feathers of Katatch, the woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus); and the black feathers at the top are from the crest of Chikaka, the quail (Lophortyx californicus). In recent forms pretty feathers of the peacock and other showy birds gotten in trade are used. The perforated disks are money from the clam shell, Kaya (Sacedomus nuttalliz); and the iridescent pendants are cut from Tem, or the haliotis shell, which is quite abundant on the Pacific coast.

All industry leads to fine art and all savage arts begin at the foot of the ladder and end ‘* beyond the bourne of sunset.” In this apotheosis, basketry is the rival of stone working, wood carving, skin dressing, and pottery. The merely useful basket has some beauty, but the exalted specimen of handiwork is the acme of intelligent discrimination in the materials as well as of hand skill and taste, and leads up to the choicest textile productions. Its maker must be botanist, colorist, weaver, designer, and poet, all in one. But could the windows of her mind be thrown open wide there would be seen, in addition to all these, the mystic love of her tribe alive and active. In the old days of unsophisticated savagery, no doubt, there was everywhere in America the overseeing and guiding presence of the mythic in the practical. Its relics are still to be found on fragments of pottery especially, and there is no reason to doubt that it reigned in other departments of activity. The old-time basket makers were under its spell everywhere. It would bean interesting study, but it can not-be pursued here, to find out how far the various peoples of Europe in settling down upon the lands of the savages had by their ethnic traits and beliefs gradually eliminated or modified those of the aborigines in the matter of symbolism.
Besides the unmodified artistic motives in the designs on basketry, there still survives in the Pacific coast area a symbolism more or less connected with Indian cosmogony. The maker is a sorcerer. In such tribes as the Hopi this idealism in design is still alive and active. Among the Algonkin Indians of the Atlantic States the thought seems to have escaped entirely from the design, and the Indian woman making her baskets at the seaside resort, at the springs, or at Niagara

Falls has no more idea of putting a thought into the colors and patterns which she weaves than though such a thing never existed. The designs are changed -to suit the whims of the buyers. Idealism is buried in commercialism. Tracing the motive around the Arctic region there still is found no pattern in basketry until southern Alaska is reached. In the birch-bark ware of middle Alaska and Canada, and in the rawhide-parfleche receptacles of the Sioux and other Plains tribes, the mythical conception is reawakened. The Ojibwa about the Great Lakes preserve all sorts of ancient patterns in porcupine-quill work on birch bark, while the Sioux, the Arapahos, and Kiowas paint upon their parfleche cases the totemic symbolism of their tribes.“ It is well to keep in mind these other symbolic representations in speaking of basketry, since they raise questions of origins and relationships. Boas is inclined to refer the designs on Salishan basketry to the tribes inland across the Cascade Mountains.
The Haida Indians of Queen Charlotte Archipelago make wailets and hats of spruce root, now and then weaving in a band of black, but the ware is extremely plain. Its decoration depends unon the various types of weaving employed and painted symbols. But the Tlinkits on the mainland and islands of southeastern Alaska, on the other hand, cover the surface of their baskets, made precisely simiiar to those of the Haidas, with symbolism connected with their daily life. “t has been thought that anciently the Tlinkits made baskets like the Haida, without colored ornaments, and that the designs on the baskets have no mythological significance. The Chilcats, however, who are akin to the Tlinkits and live on the mainland, cover the surface of their fringed robes with their totemic symbolism in most subtle fashion. The technical process on these blankets is precisely the same as that on the baskets, only the blankets are made in soft wool while the baskets are in hard material. Coming farther southward the land of the imbricated basket is reached. The sybolism on this. ware has been worked out by Livingston Farrand.’ Further on these designs will be taken up with greater detail. As the inscriptions on Assyrian slabs have preserved the thoughts and lore of Mesopotamia and the hieroglyphies of Egypt held secure for millenniums the story of the oldest of empires, so ina much humbler fashion the myths and stories of these Indians have been in the olden times symbolized on their basketry. There 1s no Rosetta stone nor alphabet of design for their decipherment, all the more diligent must the present seeker be to save the evanescent records. The basket is frequently made for no other end than to record the legend.

The Salish tribes of Washington and Oregon, and those of California, Arizona, and New Mexico, all place some kind of designs on their basketry. Whether it has a symbolical significance or not has to be determined in each case by inquiry. Looking at the whole field as revealed in collections and publications, the following classes of objects and phenomena sought to be represented seem to be complete:
1. Natural phenomena, such as lightning, sunrise, clouds, and sky.
2. Natural features of objects, such as mountains, lakes, shores, and rivers.
3. Plant phenomena, including splints of the plant used to make the design.
4. Animals and parts of animals. There is no end to this species of design, from the attempt to represent the entire animal alive and in motion, to the few stitches which stand for a part of the creature, perhaps a wing, a fin, an eye, or a tooth, to show what the animal might be.
5. Human beings, either full or in part.
6. Devices used by the Indians in their occupations, arrowheads especially.
7. Ideas connected with the Indian thought and life; for example, such as the opening in a Navaho basket.
8. Mythical personages connected with sorcery and witchcraft.
9. Their gods and heavenly beings.
In thinking of symbolism the sign or form on the basket and the thing signified must be kept separate in the mind. ‘The sign may be at the beginning pictorial and pass down through changes and abbreviations to a mere outline that has no suggestion in it, or a simple geometric figure common in the technic may become a mythic being, by making here and there a significant addition through suggestion.
When it is remembered that the Indian represents in a general way the childhood of the race, one has but to revert to that period of life to recall how a spot of ink ora meaningless form was transformed into a picture of something real or ideal. A fundamental geometric figure on basketry may in similar fashion by the addition of a line or two become almost any design, the visible home of any symbol.
In this paper, devoted more particularly to the technical side of b: sketry, the manner of realizing the symbol is still important. However, it is not so much sought to teach that a certain design represents a butterfly as to see how the woman put the form into the texture of her basket.
The sculptor, the painter, the carver, and the potter are more realistic than the basket maker, since the making of portraiture and pictures are easily within their reach. Yet nothing is more common among them all than abbreviation and synecdoche. Not only are they under the spell of symbolism, but the symbol is curtailed to the lowest terms. A fin stands for a whale, incisor teeth for a beaver, the beak for a bird, and often the image is completely obliterated in the symbol. Now the basket maker is still more handicapped by her technical limitations and driven to symbolism if she did not largely invent it. For pictorial effects on the surface, the maker is hampered by the limitations

of weaving and sewing. It will be found, therefore, that her temptations are to pass more quickly to the symbolic stage of representation. Itis well to remember also that just as on the baskets themselves the symbolism, starting with pictures, has in some tribes been reduced to its lowest terms, so in the basket maker’s mouth the legends have become faded into concrete words and then into meaningless terms, yet the thought is there. Of a certain form ona basket plaque the Hopi woman would say it is the bird that carries messages to the rain god; another tribe would call it a bird; a third name it wings, and finally it becomes an empty geometric design. Again, the student himself passes through a process of initiations as the subject. is exploited.
It is said that Pompey declared, when he had drawn aside the veil of the Holy of Holies, at Jerusalem, ‘*The Jews worship nothing.” With some such feeling the collector of baskets begins his quest. The first impression is that no set patterns were in the maker’s mind. She has a sense of the beautiful and loves to give her fancy free rein. Indeed, the reticent and suspicious basket maker helps the delusion. A little later the discovery is made that the patterns stand for things, but still for general notions. It is only after long familiarity and systematic converse with old basket makers that the veteran collector learns that the belief that these patterns stand for mountains, lakes, rivers, men and women, deer or other mammals, flying birds or bird tracks, fishes, insects, flowers, plants, heavenly bodies, or articles of use and worship merely is but a fraction of the truth. They are concrete, standing not for all or any, but for one, and underneath them is charming folklore. Mrs. Shackleford tells of a certain intricate pattern on a Washington basket that it represents ripples, but on patient inquiry it was found to mean the subtle movements in the under waters of a certain lake upon a special occasion. To appreciate symbolism fully one must know the sign, hear the story, and then study the skies, the landscape, and the social environment.
To attempt to discover an alphabet in this primitive art would be useless, for each tribe adapts old and new standard forms to its own concept myths. The artists alone, in every case, can interpret them. This existence of concrete stories in art form is not confined to basketry. Dr. Boas is authority for saying that the intricate totem post and composite painting of the North Pacific coast can be interpreted only by the carver. The attempt to find a clue to the mystery of their composition is hopeless, for none exists. As soon as the perfection of monotony or uniformity has been reached in the technic to form the basis of real art, there ensues a variety no less thorough and diversified in the ornamentation for symbolizing the same idea. The rule in the Indian woman’s mind seems to be reduced to a formula like this: ‘**’ The minimum of variety in the technic, the maximum of variety

in the symbolic.” Or, in other phrase, variety of symbolic expression in the unity of the real art. One looks carefully at a set of drawings like those of Emmons, Farrand, Fewkes, or Dixon, and turns to a familiar collection to find the same symbols. They are not there; or, rather, they are hiding there. It is a question whether there be two baskets alike in design among any tribe. This is the real charm ~ of savage hand work as compared-with the rather dull uniformity of machine products. All the tribes of the West that have preserved their symbolisms have at the same time made the most of their liberty to modify the original.
The subject of symbolism may be studied from several points of view, the technic, the elaborative or historic, and the ethnic. Beginning with the technic as the easiest, symbolism is wrought in checker, twill, wicker, twine, and coil. Looking at a coarse piece of matting made up of monotonous squares, it is not easy to see how the story of creation or tribal preservation could be wrought into them. But with finer elements and the introduction of color, a part of the difficulty vanishes. In point of fact, however, there is little evidence that sen| timent was wrought into checker, or even into twilled weaving. There is no essential difficulty in the way. Mosaic in stone or other hard material is made up of little blocks, chiefly squares, and both the twined and the coiled basketry surfaces contain innumerable designs made up in small squares in black or other color.
Symbolism may be studied in its elaboration or historic development. The history of a symbol on basketry is the same as that of a design on pottery or a painting on hide. Perhaps, since the technical demands are more exacting, the progressive appearance of the ideal is more rapid and the hiding of the original more complete. A moment’s thought makes it clear that one is dealing simply with a universal law of mental development. The basketry of any one tribe will show what is meant. On a single Hopi plaque it is not rare to see side by side the complete figure of a bird or butterfiy with outspread wings and near by an abbreviated cross which means the same thing. (See Plate 47.) i
Another specimen constructed by the same hands will have the cross but not the birds. By and by enough examples are brought into comparison to show the process of fading out through which the realistic becomes only a skeleton. There is a celebrated Japanese painting showing seven stages in the life of a beautiful girl. As she passes into womanhood, through all its years, behind the real face the pretty child is seen, and even the skull that lies among the flowers shows to the beholder, after a moment’s gaze, the lovely girlish face. In the last relic of symbol on basketry to the trained eye of mythology the same transition takes place.

ered from the hand of the maker, together with the song of the soul whose melody is written there also, makes plain what is here set forth.
Professor Farrand calls attention wisely to the fact that in the reduction of symbols to their lowest terms very dissimilar forms have converged until the same figure does duty for many objects, the technical exigency or strain predominating. This has led to differences of opinion among native connoisseurs and frequently confusion to the ethnologist. The same observation would be true in working the other way. It is only in most recent times that psychologists have appreciated the power of suggestion in helping one to determined action.
Recently a package of beautifully marked shells were sent to the National Museum as the probable origin of designs in savage art. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Form does not come to the savage artist’s mind in that way. Whether the symbol arise by contraction or expansion, the artist is the creator of new forms, working always within the school of her materials and tools.
Wicker basketry in its worst state is positively ugly. In the eastern part of North America no attempt is made to put a legend upon it, but in New Mexico and Arizona it is found ih two forms side by side, one as plain as undressed stems can be made and the other at the topmost point of pictorial representation. In Oraibi, the most western of the Hopi (Vioki) towns, are made the pretty little wicker plaques called Katchinas. The finding of fragments of these in ancient ruins by Dr. Fewkes is good proof that they have long been made by the Hopi. Farther on, the designs themselves will be examined. They are mentioned here rather to show that where there is a will with the human species, of whatever color, there is a way. Examples of Katchinas are shown in Plates 85 and 93. The Hopi wicker plaques are made up of short stems of Chrysothamnus that have been previously smoothed and dyed in as many colors as are needed. The work resembles closely that in porcupine quills. Figures do not show effectively on the back, for the reason that a single stem often passes over only one warp element. Symbols of complex pattern are also frequently finished out with the brush. In many of the intricate symbols on the Katchinas the narrow limitations of the material and the curve of texture that can go in one direction only put the artist to her wits’ end for conventionalisms. She does not mind, but goes ahead. True, a rainbow must be upside down, the sky goddess must have rectangular eyes and mouth. There is no perspective, the round must be flat, and even those features that are out of sight must be brought to view. Never mind, the ideal wins and the plaque is finished.
With twined work the case is different. All its varieties are capable in themselves of expressing ideas even in one color, but as soon as overlaying, embroidery, and the use of different hues are added there is practically no end to the possibilities. In this connection the reader may be reminded again that designs must not be confounded with sym-

<<<Page: 349>>>

bols. The former are apparent and constant and extremely limited, the latter ideal and as varied asan Indian woman’s fancy. But in the chapter on ornamentation it was seen how varied in different hands and materials twined patterns might be made. ‘Twined ware is, if anything, at the start the coarsest of all, for what could be ruder than the wattling of a fish weir or the wall of a granary’ Taking the geographic areas in turn, it is not until southeastern Alaska is reached that an attempt to tell a story in twined decoration occurs. Even there the symbol exists more in the false embroidery on the surface than in the twined work. In point of fact, however, whether studied with Emmons for southeastern Alaska; with Farrand on Salish ware; or with Dixon in northern California tribes, it is not in twined work that the most exalted and idealized symbolism has been wrought.
Coiled ware also has such a variety of technical treatment, with the whole color scheme of nature to select from, that in practice there is no limit to the form and combination of designs or of symbolism. In these the weaver secretes her thoughts. You must ask her what they mean. Rarely is one of her symbols widespread. Inthe next tribe the sign will stand for quite something else. It is well to observe here that a vast deal of coiled basketry has no symbol or design on it whatever.
Ethnic symbolism.—Recurring to the six ethnic areas which for convenience have been adopted in this publication, basketry has lost all trace of symbolism among the Indians of eastern North America. It can not be for a moment supposed that they have none, for with Algonquian, Siouan, Kiowan, the substitutes for basketry, rawhide receptacles, as well as moccasins, cradles, and objects in three dimensions, are covered with idealism in painting and embroidery. ~ To understand the richness of this survival of aboriginal symbolism the student will receive his principal aid at hand in the researches of A. L. Kroeber among the Arapaho.“ Four hundred and fifty-eight distinct symbols are given in figures covering Indian ideas from common objects to spiritual beings. All the closing pages of the abovenamed paper (pp. 188-150) must be examined carefully in order to comprehend both the sign and the thing signified, the thought and the overthought, the text and the symbolic context in Arapaho embroideries, paintings, and three dimension designs. The closing paragraph will give the gist of Dr. Kroeber’s study:
The closeness of connection between this Arapaho decorative symbolism and the religious life of the Indians can not well be overestimated by a white man. Apart from the existence of a great amount of decorative symbolism on ceremonial objects
not described in this chapter, it should be borne in mind that the making of what have been called tribal ornaments is regularly accompanied by religious ceremonies;
@Symbolism of the Arapaho Indians (Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, XIII, 1900, pp. 69-86); Decorative Symbolism of the Arapaho (American Anthropologist N. 8., III, 1901; pp. 308-336); The Arapaho (Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, X VIII, 1902, pp. 1-150).

that some styles of patterns found on tent ornaments and parfleches are very old and sacred, because originating from mythic beings; that a considerable number of objects are decorated according to dreams and visions; and, finally, that all symbolism, even when decorative and unconnected with any ceremony, tends to be to the Indian a matter of a serious and religious nature.
The Eskimo also and the Aleuts perpetuate no thought or myth in basketry symbols. The etchings of the former on ivory are also modern and were learned from outside teachers. It is not in these that the idea is to be sought. Not for a moment is it to be thought, however, that there is no symbolism existing. Al the life is wrapped up in hunting. The long, dark winter, the return of the sun with the innumerable retinue of life in the air and in the waters gives the keynote. It is inthe dramaof hunting and the masks worn in dances that symbolism is embodied.
On the Pacific coast from Alaska to the peninsula of California and in the Interior Basin the tribes have been left to their own devices through the centuries, and it is here that survivals of symbolism are to be sought. They will be found in one place full of life and ancient spirituality; in another stung by civilization, they are as torpid as the spiders that are placed in their nests by the mud wasps.
The name Tlinkit applies to a number of basket-making tribes in southeastern Alaska. In their charming archipelago they have developed a unique scheme of symbolism growing out of their mode of life. This has been thoroughly studied by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. 5. Navy, in his collections in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and the identifications here made are on his authority.“ They cover a wide range of meanings. Supplementary to this basket symbolism, or rather preeminent over it, are the Chilkat blankets and the endless variety of carvings in stone, horn, and wood, and the symbolic paintings on all sorts of surfaces. The following identifications are from specimens in the U. 5. National Museum:

Plate 71 shows specimens of twined wallets made of spruce roots, for carrying berries and other articles of food on the back. The lefthand figure in this plate is Catalogue No. 20704 in the National Museum and was collected by James G. Swan, at Sitka, Alaska. It is an excellent specimen of twined weaving, with what is here called false embroidery. The figures on the surface, determined by Lieutenant Emmons, are as follows: The two wide bands contain the following ornaments: The large five-sided figures in the middle are the ‘* Shark’s tooth; ” the chevron pattern covering the shark’s tooth means the ** Flaking of flesh of fish into narrow strips;” the small triangular figures are the ‘Salmon berry cut in halves,” but in this arrangement also called ** Water drops;” the narrow middle band is rendered ‘* Single tying around;” below the ornamental band the cross-shaped figure represents the ‘‘ Raven’s tail.”
The right-hand figure in this plate is also a berry basket. The two wider bands have the same design, having a bar in the middle with its ends bifurcated, known by the Tlinkit as *‘ The crossing.” The triangles in these bands stand for ‘* The salmon berry cut in halves.” The middle band is ‘‘ Tying around.” The vertical designs at the bottom represent ‘‘An eye” on one side, and on the other side ‘‘ Shark’s tooth.” The five-sided figure with a reentrant angle stands for ‘* The Arctic tern’s tail.” Catalogue No. 21560, U.S.N.M., collected by J. B. White.
The right-hand figure in Plate 72, Catalogue No. 20704A in the National Museum, collected by J. G. Swan, is a cylindrical basket in twined weaving. The upper part of the body of this basket is divided into three bands worked in straw, natural color, and dyed red and brown. The symbols inthe upper and lower band are (1) the ‘* Spirit voice, or the shadow of a tree,” in zigzag lines; (2) vertical rows of rhombs, which indicate the eye; the middle band, made up of sinuous lines on rectangular figures is called ‘‘Tying around.” The allusion may be either to the fact that this figure constitutes an encircling band, or to the sinuous pattern itself. On the lower part of the body the fretted pattern, with three rectangles inclosed in the bents like the bars on an epaulette, stands for ‘t The tattooing on the back of the hand of an old person.”
Plate 37 represents two small, beautiful baskets with rattles in the tops, made by the Tlnkit Indians of southeastern Alaska. Both of them are covered over the entire surface with false embroidery in three colors. The small patterns on the baskets portray the salmon berry and the triangular figures stand for shark’s teeth. These are fine old specimens collected in 1875 by Dr. J. B. White, U. S. Army. Catalogue No. 21562.

warp is crossed, and the weaving is in twined work ornamented with false embroidery. The upper band and the one across the middle of the body represent ‘* The salmon berry cut in half,” while the band of the shoulder and the one at the bottom stand for ** The leaves of the fireweed.”
The upper covered jar on the same plate illustrates the combination of false embroidery and the use of two colors in the material out of which the specimen is woven. This specimen is Catalogue No. 9112 U.S.N.M., and was collected in Alaska by Lieut. F. M. Ring, U. S. Army.
The Haida Indians on Queen Charlotte Islands are near to the Tlinkit in arts, but weave no symbols into their basketry. They paint various designs on their ceremonial hats and have no end of richest symbolism on their canoes and carved in wood and slate. They also now engrave on silver and keep alive the poetry of their ancient art.
The following story, collected for Lieutenant Emmons by a friend, proves that the basket is not altogether out of touch with their world of myth:
Once upon a time there were two Haida Indian orphan girls living on Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. After being punished by their stepmother for eating up a store of deer tallow they resolved to runaway. They wandered about in the forest a long time and were eventually rescued by the ‘*seek quan ni” (Black Bear tribe), one of whom married the girls. Years afterwards these girls determined to visit the scenes of their sad childhood. For their journey back from the forest to places of human habitations their good totem spirit directed them to weave two baskets apiece large enough to fit over the end of the thumb. These they were directed to fill with crumbs of various kinds of cured meats and deer tallow. As in the miracle of the five loaves and two fishes which sufliced for a multitude, the contents of these tiny baskets furnished food for the two women on their journey of many moons. Arrived at the entrance of their father’s house their baskets suddenly became very large, so large, in fact, that it required the strength of many slaves to take them into the house. The women found their stepmother still alive. They offered her the various meats and tallow which they had brought from their forest home. More, and yet more food they pressed upon her until the unhappy woman died of overeating.
Professor Farrand selected happily the most versatile of all the North American families of Indians for his studies, the Salishan. Among these the Lillooet and Thompson baskets, of British Columbia, supply the flat and round types of imbricated coiled work, and the Quinaielt, on Puget Sound, the overlaid twined weaving. The Klikitat ware is not included, but a comparison of its symbols with the Salish would be profitable. The line of development in symbolism among
NAT Mus 1902——21

<<<Page: 353>>>

the Salish tribes has been from the pictorial to the geometric. Professor Farrand finds that the use of animal designs is by no means predominant. This was seen to be true on the Tlinkits also, while the Chilecat (Tlinkit) blanket shows the dissected and distorted motives described by Boas.”
The list of symbols on the baskets of the lower Thompson Indians is given by Mr. James Teit. It is made up of:
1. Arrowhead pattern (tataza, arrowhead ). 2. Root pattern (mula, a variety of root). 3. Butterfly pattern (nkikaxeni, butterfly ). 4. Star pattern (nkokucén, star). 5. Packing strap pattern (tsupin, packing strap). 6. Zigzag pattern (skolotz, crooked). 7. Box pattern (luka, grave box). 8. Eagle pattern (haldu, eagle).
Kach of these words is compounded with the suflix ‘‘aist,” pattern; but the lower Thompson also have symbols for snake or snakeskin, snake or snake tracks, rattlesnake tail, grouse or bird tracks, bear foot or bear tracks, bird or geese flying, fly, beaver, deer, horse, man, hand, tooth, leaf, shells (dentalia), stone hammer, comb, neckluce, net, root-digger handle, leggings, canoe, trail, stream, lake, mount, air, lightning, and the same is true of other Salishan tribes.
Plates 74 to 79, reproduce Professor Farrand’s figures and the descriptions are from his monograph.’ These illustrations, being most of them in a difficult technical process called imbrication furnish excellent studies in mosaic pictographs. The elements are all little squares in different colors, varying from one-eighth to one-quarter inch in dimensions. Much charity is needed in detecting the thing in the symbol. The shark’s mouth with its horrid teeth, is rather intensified by the angularity of the design, but most of the things represented are hidden in the symbol.
Plate 74, fig. 1, shows a coiled and imbricated berry basket of the Lillooet Indians, British Columbia. It has a pyramidal form, flat foundation in the coils, and the decoration is in two segments or bands. The designs are flies, arrowheads, and half circles (4).

For the northern California and southern Oregon tribes the guide to the study of symbolism is Roland B. Dixon.” who divides basketry into three types (see fig. 163.):
I. Northwestern type includes the area occupied by the Hupa (Athapascan), Karok (Quoratean), Yurok (Weitspekan). The technic is twined work overlaid.
Il. Northeastern type comprises Modoc and Klamath (Lutuamian), Shasta (Sastean), Pit River (Palaihaihan), Yana (Yanan), Wintun (Copehan), and Maidu (Pujunan). The technic is twined and coiled.
Ill. Pomo type.—This versatile people of the Kulanapan family in its technic is cosmopolitan, using both twined and coiled ware in every variety. The Yuki and the Costanoan are left unclassed.
Three groups of symbolsare distinguished by Dixon— animal designs, plant designs, and representations of natural or artificial objects. For the Pomo symbols he relies upon Carl Purdy, collector of material from that people in the American Museum, New York. For the northeastern group, Dr. Dixon has made exhaustive personal observations and illustrated the symbols in Plates 1-xvt of his monograph.
The following story applies to a beautiful piece of basket work from the Yuki Indians, now in Round Valley Agency, Covelo, California. They are associated with the Wailakis, who are Athapascan, but the Yuki themselves form a separate family. Catalogue No. 131108 in the U.S.N.M., Plate 80, is called a sun basket, of Yuki manufacture,

collected by N. J. Purcell, and in order to complete its history it is necessary to know what the Yukis believe to be the origin of the world. ‘* In the beginning there was no land; all was water. Darkness prevailed everywhere. Over this chaos of dark waters hovered ‘On-coye-to,’ who appeared in the form of a beautiful white feather, hence the love of the Yukis for feathers. In time the spirit became weary of his incessant flight through the murky space and lighted down upon the face of the water. Where he came in contact with the water there was a whirlpool that spun his body round and round. So rapid became the motion that a heavy foam gathered about him. This became more dense and expanded in width and length. It gathered up the passing bubbles until it was a huge floating island. On the bosom of this rested the snowy form of On-coye-to. As he lay upon this island after an almost endless flight through the dark space, the idea of a permanent resting place came into his mind. So he made the land and divided it from the water. From the form of a feather he assumes that of aman and rested upon the land. Still there was no light, and the spirit was troubled. On-coye-to saw far off in the firmament a star, po-ko-lil-ey, and resolved to visit it and learn how it emitted its sparkling light. After a long journey he arrived and found a large and beautifully lighted world, inhabited by a numerous, hospitable people. Still, he saw not whence came the light. He was allowed free access to all the habitations save one, * the sweat house.’ This was guarded night and day, and was accessible only to sick persons. Finally a great hunt was planned, and as the time drew near all was prepared for the occasion. But On-coye-to feigned sickness, that he might investigate the sweat house. When the morning arrived for the hunt he was too ill to accompany the hunters. A council was held to determine whether this stranger should be admitted to the sweat house, which is even now a sacred place with the Yuki tribe, and it was decided to give him the benefit of this house of medicine, religion, gambling, and many other practices. A few old men were left to administer to his wants and to see that all went well. As he entered the sweat house he was almost blinded by the light that flashed upon him. As he became accustomed to it he looked around him and discovered its origin. Hanging high over his head in several baskets were as many beautiful suns. Having found the fountain of light he waited patiently until the old men were all asleep, then climbed cautiously to what seemed the brightest of the suns, took down the basket which held it, slipped from the sweat house and made his way rapidly back toward his own world. He was hotly pursued by the indignant warriors, but he arrived safely after many adventures. He hung the sun in its basket far in the east, then surveyed it. It did not light up to suit him and he moved it a little higher. Still it did not suit him, so he continued to move it on and on, and is moving it to the present

day.” Thus the Indian accounts for the moving of the sun, and thinks not that the earth moves. :
The basket here shown is believed to be a copy of the same in which the sun was stolen from the other world and brought to this. On the bottom is a piece of polished abalone shell cut round to represent the sun. Below this is suspended a new moon, then a fish, and all around the sides hang pieces of the same shell, which the Yuki say represents the stars. (N. J. Purcell.)
As before mentioned, Dr. Dixon relies on Mr. Purdy for the symbolism on the Pomo basketry. The collection was made in 1900, and the names of designs given. Since that time more information has come to Mr. Purdy, and some of the terms are changed. The U.S. National Museum has the collection of Dr. J. W. Hudson for comparison, made some years earlier. The interpretations of the symbols by the two men are quite as interesting a study in the psychology of the collectors as of the Indian basket women. From Dr. Hudson’s manuscript accompanying his collection the following notes on symbolism are taken. The underlying thought in his mind is that each separate social group of the Pomo has peculiar types of basketry known by the keynote in the ornamentation, which is the totem of that group.
Both in painting and in feather decoration the following colors have a significance with the Pomo:
Red: bravery; pride. (Personified by the woodpecker. ) Yellow: amatory; success; gaiety; fidelity. (Lark.) Blue: demoniac cunning; perfidy. (Jay. )
Green: astuteness; discretion; watchfulness. (Duck. ) Black: conjugal love; beauty. (Quail. )
White: riches; generosity. (Wampum. )
The following interpretations of signs were given by Dr. Hudson in connection with his collection of basketry secured by the U. S. National Museum:
Baiyakan (Baiyak, net mesh). Same as Mr. Purdy’s. The design is an alternation of dark and hght squares between two boundary lines.
Bishekamak, deer’s hoofs or trail made by those animals in the mud. Very rare pattern, once common to the Taco (Yukian) of Potter Valley. Consists of two rightangled triangles joining so as to represent the track of a deer’s hoof.
Bishemao, deer’s loins, the mottles on the buck’s rump when struggling out of the slime of Clear Lake at the creation. Parallel lines with the inclosed space filled with dark and light paralielograms.
Bisheo, deer’s teeth, seen by the primal Indians when that animal called to them for help as he struggled in the mud. <A row of little squares with open spaces between.
Danokakea, Mountain Waters tribe, totem of a tribe once living 6 miles north of Upper Lake, in the mountains at the headwaters of McClure Creek, and a close affinity and neighbor of the Pomo of Potter Valley. A band of equilateral triangles in two colors alternating.

<<<Page: 360>>>

Ka wi na ote, or Ka wina mi yak, turtle neck. A charm of halved turtle backs strung one above the other, indicated by three equilateral triangles, one resting on another.
Katsha, arrowheads often represented on the basket as strung together and worn as necklaces.
Katshak, arrowhead. A row of equilateral triangles bounded by two lines and touching by their bases, or having the apex of each one touching the middle of the base of the other.
Kawinateedi, turtle backs which were seen floating on the waves of Clear Lake. A series of rhombs adjoining one another.
Kea, quail plume. Totem of the confederated tribes of Lake County, California, especially those living in the valleys around Clear Lake. This excludes the Napo, Pe ie ee aise Gnd ion pe waicr lily village ho had na recomnized totems. The Yokaia also claimed the Kea totem, being close kin to Lake tribes, though living across the range. L-shape and Z-shape designs in color. Most common of Pomo symbols.
Misakalak, blacksnake, a totem recognized as belonging to the Shokowa of Schokowa valley, around Hopeland. Represents a snake trail. Two parallel lines near together with a sinuous pattern between.
Na wa kai, a totem consisting of a series of ponds connected by a slough, and this tribe is totally extinct, yet the pattern is often seen in the Yokaia village and called Baketch, or man’s spit. This is a row of squares made up of dots.
Poma, red earth. Named from the mound of siliceous earth in Potter Valley, whence all Pomos sprung, and from which, to this day, their ceremonial yeast or sacrament is dug to be mixed with their bread and eaten. The totem of a Potter Valley tribe. Pomo = red (stone) mine or quarry, where argillite or magnetite is mined for wampum. <A row of triangles in red splints.
Shakobiya, grasshopper elbows, or the spines on the tarsi. Trail noted in mud. It consists of a line of right-angled triangles joined at their bases.
Shakokamak, grasshopper tracks made in the mud at creation. Parallel rows of dots in fours.
Tsi yo tsi yo, up and down, the word Ka being understood. ‘‘ Waves’’ rolling back from the shores of Clear Lake, releasing the new-born creatures. Three zigzag lines parallel and oblique. Certain Lake County Pomo tribes use the term tsi yo tsi yo, signifying waves, or the marriage of the east wind to the waters of Clear Lake, representing it by a series of dotted parallelograms in stepped pattern.
Carl Purdy’s vocabulary of Pomo symbols on basketry is as follows:
Baiyakan (Baiyak, net), band of rectangles, called meshes; also, snake.
Bishe mao, or mia, backbone or ribs of a deer. Rectangles or rhombs en échelon.
Butterfly pattern, Long Valley Indian (Copehan).
Chi kakh, quail.
Dalan, halved. (Yokaia, dilan. )
Dan, opening. (Compare the path in Navaho baskets. )
Itchi cu we; len we is naked, or bare and naked; itei teu we, bare of design—i. e. not ornamented.
Ka pok poko, short design, rhomb or rectangle in the middle.
Ka tio tio, waves (Ka, water, and tio tio, rippling); or Kahio, or Kalio (?).
Kailakama, crow foot (kai, crow, and akama, foot).
Kalcha misit, arrow points. ( Yokaia. )
Kalen le lan, white mark in the middle.

Keya, tip or top.
Lelan (lilan) in the middle.
Mato, large; Kalcha mato, arrowhead large.
Mi sit, point; or miset (?). Upper Lake Pomo.

Siot sio, zigzag, waves.
Tchikaka ke-ya, quail tip (Tehikaka, quail; ke-ya, top knot).
Una leu, crossing.
Utcha, neck.
Mr. Purdy’s interpretations of Pomo symbols will be found in Dr. Dixon’s paper before quoted. If the reader have a collection of Pomo baskets, an examination of the symbols on them in comparison with the Dixon plates will demonstrate what liberties the basket weaver took with her designs. May be, it were better to say, what struggles she made to realize a design or symbol under general and special limitations.

To illustrate the technic of symbolism, Plate 81, Catalogue No. 203398, collected by Dr. J. W. Hudson, is presented. It shows a gift basket of the Pomo Indians, made by a Yokian woman whose name is Keshbim, who worked upon it seven months. The pattern is a pictograph of a feast, the bottom of the basket being tule mats (bitsan) interspersed on the assembly hall floor, not shown in the figure. The band of rhomboid figures around the bottom is the roof of the dance lodge with its rafters crossed and interlaced, and the dancers, male and female, are celebrating the Maa ca ka (food-falling) harvest (acorns). The Pomos have four seasons in their year, beginning on the first full moon (tha na bu sa da, thumb moon) in July, and Sa ha nim, smoke-floating time, has four moons; Maaca ka has three moons, beginning with Batooda, index moon. Katsana, green earth, has three moons, and Kat sami, green-things time, has three moons. This basket, under the old régime, would have been presented to some friend during the feast, demanding a very handsome return, for no one appreciated a fine piece of work like a Pomo woman. The foundation is of willow rods. The sewing is not done with linen

thread as one would suppose, but with roots split so fine that in some places the sewing shows 60 stitches to the inch.
Dr. Dixon has made careful personal investigations concerning the symbolism on the basketry of California tribes east of the Sacramento River.“ The following designs with their tribal assignments may be found in Dr. Dixon’s plates:
Arrow points. (Plate 23.) | Flying geese. (Plate 23.) Bear’s foot. (Plate 23. ) Leaves strung. (Plate 24.) Bent elbow. (Plate 23.) Pulled around. (Plate 24.) Cross waves. (Plate 24.) | Rattlesnake. (Plate 23.) Deer excrement. (Plate 24.) Striped. (Plate 24.)
Empty spool. (Plate 24.) | Water snake. (Plate 23.) Fish tail. (Plate 23.) | Wolf’s eye. (Plate 23.)
MOQUELUMNAN DESIGNS Kye. (Plate 26.) | Quail tip. (Plate 26.) PIT RIVER (PALAIHNIHAN) DESIGNS
Arrow point. (Plate 22.) | Skunk’s nose. (Plate 22.) Lizzard. (Plate 23.)
Deer excrement. (Plate 25.) | Rattlesnake. (Plate 25.) Earthworm. (Plate 25.) | Water snake. (Plate 25.)
Wolt’s eve. (Plate 25.) | House. (Plate 25.)
Dr. Dixon’s conclusions are of interest. Designs are subject to much variation, chiefly through different arrangements of elementary and constant forms in the pattern. If there are two or more types for the same element they are never found together. Designs are essentially the same on coiled and twined basketry, but most of the Maidu baskets are coiled, and there is suggestion of acculturation from the Pit Rivers. Function and form of the basket have something to do with symbols, certain designs being restricted to plaques, others to soup bowls, and so on. The spiral line is a favorite in massing symbols. Some of the patterns are found everywhere in the Maidu area, others are quite restricted. In most cases, and this is the universal testimony, the intent of the design is not clear from mere inspection, but must be explained before it can be understood. The author’s summary of Maidu symbols is the very large variety and number, the frequency of animal designs, the unusual predominance of plant designs, the number in which the realism is obscured, the

tendency to spiral and zigzag patterns, and the well-nigh universal practice of putting but a single design on a basket.
Plate 82, fig. 1, is a Washoe basket 84 inches high, 12 inches wide, and 6 inches across the opening. There are 30 stitches to the inch. Colors, red, black, and brown. Weight, 16 ounces. The legend is named ** Migrating,” or ** When the birds leave their nests and fly away we shall move.” The lower left-hand basket, fig. 2, is 7 inches high, 113 inches across, and 6 inches over the opening, with 30 stitches to the inch. The body is light-gold color, and the ornamentations are in red and black. Weight, 15 ounces. The legend is, ‘‘ Rays of the sun ascending.” An attempt to imitate the radial appearance of the light at sunrise. The lower right-hand basket, fig. 3, is 7 inches high, 6 inches across the opening, and 113 inches in diameter, with 30 stitches to the inch. The body is light-gold color and the decorations are in red and black. Attention is invited to the intricate combination of squares and triangles, stepped patterns, and rhombs to form the total design on the surface. These symbols relate to the different ‘anks or degrees in the chieftancy of the tribe which they are entitled to receive by inheritance. This information is based on the studies of A. Cohn, of Carson City, Nevada.
Plate 83 is a Tulare bottle-neck, collected on Tule River, Tulare County, California, and is in the collection of C. P. Wilcomb. The material and sewing are similar to those in other Tulare baskets. The ornamentation deserves especial attention. The bands of rhombs on the body and the part on the upper border which resembles the shaftment and feather of an arrow are common to the region. On the middle of the body, however, is a band of ornamentation which resembles the Egyptian ankh. It is useless to speculate on the origin of this symbol, since the Indians in this part of California have been in touch with the Latin-American race for centuries. In this InyoKern-Tulare subarea Dr. C. Hart Merriam finds the crenellated design to be associated in symbolism with the spasmodic flight of the butterfly as it flits among the flowers (see Plates 41, 188, 192, 194) and calls attention to the dispersion of the symbol as far north as southeastern Alaska.
Designs were found by Dr. George H. Pepper” on the ancient basketry from the caves of southeastern Utah. He refers them to symbols as they are now understood among living tribes, but recognizes that such forms do not stand for the same object always, even in the same tribe. The designs given are the butterfly of the Maidu, waterfowls, mountain, and sun. A glance at the beautiful workmanship and the designs on Dr. Pepper’s specimens at once places them not

in the Ute or Shoshonean family, but with the exquisite basket-making tribes westward in California. They have the three-rod foundation. The upper one is 174 inches in diameter and 5 inches deep.
The basket having the butterfly design was found over the body of an infant, and this led the finder to the conviction that the forms had ‘some mythic significance. These specimens, and many more, belonging to the Wetherill, the McLeod, and Graham collections are now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. (See Plate 84.)
The Pueblos called Hopi in northeastern Arizona were visited by the Spaniards in the early part of the 16th century. Having no gold to tempt the avarice of the conquerors, they were let alone. On their coiled and wicker baskets, used in their religious ceremonies, are shown the personages and phenomena most intimately associated with their cult. Iam indebted to Dr. J. Walter Fewkes for the interpretation of their symbolism.
The basket shown in Plate 85 is peculiar to the Hopi village of Oraibi; has a picture of the Corn Maiden (Shalakomana or Palahikomana). The head bears the representation of a tablet which is symbolic of the rain clouds. The colors represent the rain clouds of the four cardinal points: Yellow, the north; blue, the west; red, the south; white, the east. Usually in representations of this maiden the Hopi hair puffs are represented. A design on the forehead stands for an ear of corn, which is one of the symbolic marks of this maiden. There ought to be represented in the middle of the forehead, dependent from this ear of corn, a fragment of Haliotis shell. This is for the rainbow. The two eyes appear as bands, and should be of different colors, the left green or blue, the right red. The two bands below the eyes are meant for facial markings which are generally triangular in shape. Green and red stripes on the chin represent the rainbow. On paintings the bow is curved the other way, but the restrictions of basket making require the curve to be downward. The blanket on the body is a garment made of feathers, the individual feathers being represented by blue and red bands. This is the earth goddess or corn goddess. Interesting descriptions of the ceremony in which this Corn Maiden or sky goddess is engaged will be found in Dr. Fewkes’s interesting paper“ on the Minor Hopi Festivals. On Plate 24, opposite page 494 of his article, is illustrated the Palahiko-mana dance. She is shown as the central figure. The headdress, body garment, and embroidered blanket are represented in full. The headdress is decked with feather plumes, and altogether the appearance is more striking. The basket weaver has done her best where her pictorial ability gave out, at least, to indicate the presence of even the clan markings on the face, which in the drawings picture the human hand.

<<<Page: 365>>>

The top figure, Plate 93, shows the birds of the four cardinal points, two very much enlarged and two smaller. The stripes on the border are the tail feathers of the larger birds. The limitations of the basket maker are well shown in the specimen, in that all perspective is neglected and every part of the body brought to the same plane; the feet are turned around so as to show the toes.
The lower figure in the same plate represents one bird. The head on the upper margin having rain-cloud appendages, the beak being represented by an extension on the right hand side. The wider symbolic colors are abbreviated in every part. The bend in the knee is shown by the rectangular spaces representing the leg. (See Plate 93.)
The basket shown in Plate 47 was made at the Hopi village of Oraibi. The symbols on this basket represent the sky birds of the four cardinal points, two of which are larger, two smaller, apparently made so for want of room. The central figure represents the heart of the sky with geometrical rain-cloud figures. The sky god has a number of names.
In the upper figure (see Plate 216), the designs have got past the pictorial stage, and the meaning could only be known by consulting the maker of the basket. It is doubtful whether she did any more than what she saw her mother do. It might be possible, if a large series were had, to follow this symbol outward to the known pictorial
form. ~The lower figure in this plate represents the four birds of the cardinal points. The standard colors of the cardinal points are not all in the design because the basket itself is yellow, which deprived the workwoman of the privilege of representing the north. The symbol is very highly conventionalized.
The figures on both examples, Plate 30, denote rain clouds.
The same types of symbolism, occasioned by the climate, the physical features and productions of the arid region will be found at Zuni and among the Rio Grande Pueblos.“ Symbolism on the basketry of Middle and South America has not been worked out.

VI. USES OF BASKETRY Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.—DEUTERONOMY, XXVIII: 5.
Nature has provided members of the animal kingdom with recepta-cles which are a part of their anatomy. The camel has its water sack, the ruminant animals have their extra stomach for the storage of grasses, the squirrel carries nuts in the pouch in the side of his cheek, and certain insects are provided with various means of transporting food to a distance. It remained for the human race to invent appliances to accomplish similar results, and basketry forms one of the principal means adapted to such needs. There is practically no limit to the uses to which basket-work weaving has been put. The enumeration of these uses in detail will show what a prominent place the receptacle has had for holding water, food, and other precious objects, for gathering the materials connected with industry and for transporting them. Basketry also enters into the house, the furniture, the clothing, the armor, the domestic economy, the family life, and religion of the American tribes.
There are a multitude of secondary uses of baskets which will be mentioned in the proper place. Certainly they have done as much as any other industry to develop the intellectual life of savage women, both a knowledge of the resources of nature and a taste for aesthetic products. It willalso be found that there is no gulf between basketry, beadwork, lacework, and loom work. There are times when the basket weaver suspends her work and, with the use of her fingers alone, imitates the products of most complicated weaving frames. The highest steps in basket making will be the first steps in the great mechanical art which now costs so many millions of dollars and employs so many human beings.
Before the coming of the European, basketry supplied nearly every domestic necessity of the Indians, from an infant’s cradle to the richlydecorated funerary jars burned with the dead. The wealth of a family was counted in the number and beauty of its baskets and the highest virtue of woman was her ability to produce them. Some domestic vessels were named for the particular service they performed; as bi-ti-bo-um’ (dishes), or Ka-dem (water giver) among the Pomos; but the majority were known by their weave or shape. Vessels of the Tee weave, says Hudson, bore the brunt of culinary usage, as pots, pails, roasters, etc. There were two varieties of sifters; the coarse pshu-kan separating the crumbs for nut cake, etc., and the ma-a-p6-i, or finer sifter (a conoid utensil), which, slightly tilted and struck sharply within by the finger tips, spills the chaff over the outer margin.

<<<Page: 367>>>

The great value of her work reflected upon the maker herself. It was the most expert woman in basketry, says Miss Jennie C. Carr, who brought the highest price, namely, two strings of shell money.
Of old basketry some examples are clean while others are soiled and dilapidated. The former had the good fortune to fall into careful hands half a century ago, when they were new, and have with the years merely faded down to their indescribable shades. The other precious old pieces have been
Dipped in baths of hissing tears And battered by the shocks of doom.
The study of structure in basketry, as in other activities, leads to investigations concerning functions and use. Among the least favored tribes in this regard there is a similarity to the lower forms of animal life where the same structure performs a number of processes. It is also common to see among plain sort of people and the uneducated one utensil used for many purposes. So with the little advanced tribes of Indians there will be one technical process in basket making and very small variety of forms for many uses, but when the more advanced and skillful tribes are reached there is a differentiation of function and along with it corresponding differences in structure and technical processes even in the same piece. :
In the study of function there are two inquiries of equal value, namely, (1) the geographic distribution of functions together with the particular types of basketry that are used to perform these offices from place to place, and (2) tribal origins and purposes in order to connect function with ethnological and geographical studies. In each one of the six areas into which the Western Hemisphere has been divided the uses to which baskets are put will be decided by the animals, plants, and minerals that are indispensable to the happiness of the people, and the forms and characteristics of the baskets will depend upon the plants that are to he had for making them. On the seashore there must be clam baskets and fish baskets. In the interior there will be berry baskets; and in those regions where no pottery is to be found cooking baskets, in which food is boiled by means of hot stones, are among the commonest objects in sight. From the other point of view a more subtle question arises, whether ethnology has anything to do with basket materials or things to be carried in them. In tracing the history of invention during its primitive stages it will at once be recognized that the art of basket making was greatly stimulated by the multiplication of ends to be served; that the inventive faculty having such a versatile and accommodating material found scope for its own enlargement and improvement. In the end it becomes apparent that the art and the artist have set themselves one to the other ‘like perfect music unto perfect words.” The basket

<<<Page: 368>>>

adapts itself to the woman’s life. It is not easy to pin any special structure upon a definite tribe, however, since women were captured or ran away mayhap into other tribes. A quiet system of pedagogy was going on all the time in basketry, as well as in other activities. The uses of basketry will be given in further detail, the topics arranged in alphabetic order.
An interesting phase of the struggle between use and beauty is to be seen in the compromises which they make for space on the same basket. The jewel, the cremation chef dceuvre, the precious gift to a friend, may be covered with designs, have the most beautiful on the bottom, or where the maker’s fancy led her. On the other hand, the piece for common uses is a despair of the artist; it is bereft of ornament. Among the Tlinkit of southeastern Alaska, while the covered trinket baskets are decorated to the ground, the cylindrical food baskets are plain near the bottom, and in many examples half the way up the body. This compromise in decoration is more apparent in the heavy coiled work of the British Columbia tribes. Boxes for show, cradles, and such examples are surrendered to the decorator, while the berry baskets and cooking pots have their decorations chiefly on the upper portion of the body. This fact limits the motives in the design. On old pieces it is melancholy to see how the hard wear of years has invaded the sacred precincts of art and destroyed even the symbols of religion. On the California basketry art was predominant. The spirals descend nearly to the bottoms of the mush bowls and the carrying baskets, but a glance reveals at the point of strain a patch of ordinary strong weaving or a protective covering.
As previously mentioned, baskets are receptacles of some kind or other. They do not of themselves usually perform work, but are used for holding the materials and apparatus of work. The art of basketry, however—that is, the plication or working of somewhat rigid materials—easily passed out of the mere making of receptacles into the construction of all sorts of objects needed in daily life.
The uses of basketry are either industrial or ideal. Industrially, they are connected first with the whole range of obtaining food or nourishment and the other natural materials wpon which all history depends.
With the secondary industries, called manufactures, with transportation, and with consumption or enjoyment, one has but to take a stroll along the crowded dock, as in a great seaport, or the busy warehouse of any modern city, to become familiar with the infinite number of ways in which the basket lends its services to the comfort of the human race.
All of these functions, so intricate and diversified in civilization, are represented in savagery by much more simple occupations, from which, however, the basket is never absent.

<<<Page: 369>>>

Beyond the drudgeries of life lie its beatitudes, and here the basket is also present. In fine art, in social functions, in birth, in lore, in custom, and even in burial it is not absent.
A detailed description of the way in which these functions are performed by basketry, with abundant illustrations, will show just what is meant in these declarations.
Carrying in baskets was done by the Americans on the head, on the back with head band or breast strap, and in the hands; about the home the basket was scarcely ever absent. It was the strongest of all Indian fabrics, easily made into any shape convenient to the load or the carrier, and it was lightness itself. In a hemisphere almost devoid of pack animals, where woman was the ubiquitous beast of burden, is it any wonder that she invented the most economical of devices for holding and transporting? Since nothing grows where it is wanted, an attempt to enumerate the things transported in baskets would be to list every natural material that contributed to the Indian’s happiness. Mineral, vegetal, and animal substances are all in there. Clay from the quarry, water from the spring, stones for working, firewood, edible roots, fruits, and seeds, textile materials, fish, flesh, and fowl are a part of the freight ever on the move throughout the culture areas.
The carrying basket did not lose its multitudinous functions for women with the departure of savagery. One has only to look into market houses and stores, walk along the streets, or visit farms in the country to be convinced of this.
They are borne on the head, shoulder, hips, or knees; they are hung to the body in every possible fashion, and carried by two or more persons with the hands—all for loading ships, cars, or wagons. They are used also as panniers on the backs of animals, and smaller and better specimens are used by the interminable procession of children and buyers and travelers.
The transportation basket did not cease as a stimulus to invention with its holding things and spurring the maker to do her best in its composition. It waked up her mind in other directions. Her feet had to be fitly shod to gather materials; thus sandals were often in basket work. Her clothing required adjustments to new occupations and exposures in the new activities made possible by the art. Even the baskets of other functions were perfected and new functions were created by the carrying art.

ber of illustrations are devoted to showing the variety of ways in which baskets may become vehicles among the aborigines of our hemisphere.
Edwin Bryant describes the moving of a Sioux camp near Fort Laramie in 1846.4 The tent poles were fastened to the sides of the ponies for travaux. Crosspieces were lashed to these and small children were confined in cages made from willows in the form of crates for crockery, having doors on the sides.

boat which they call ‘‘cora,” woven so tight as to be waterproof without the aid of pitch or other application. And upon the same parallel of latitude, along the Gulf of Mexico, the Indians used to cross the rivers on floats of cane woven together and called ‘‘ cajen.” Bundles of cane were laid together sidewise, and over them others, the whole being woven together.”
Formerly mats were used by the Makah as canoe sails, but at present they are employed for wrapping up blankets, for protecting the cargoes in canoes, and for sale to the whites, who use them as linirg of rooms, or as floor coverings (James G. Swan).
Besides the endless carrying of things among the Indians, called
sie transportation, there is, it must : not be forgotten, a large amount of passenger movement. The cradle, or, more correctly, the papoose basket, was the beginning of devices for carrying persons. Except a little riding by people of note on the backs of men in the Andes, only infants were passengers in aboriginal days throughout America.
For the infant there were three zones Of going about in the Western Hemisphere, the Arctic, the Temperate, and the ‘Tropical; speaking technically, the zone of the fur hood, the zone of the carrying frame, and the zone of free motion. The Atlantic province tribes made use of flat boards or racks, the Eskimo mother carried

In nearly all of them the feet and head are left free.’ The Hupa Indians, on the Hupa Reservation, in northwestern California, belong to the Athapascan family in Alaska and northwestern Canada, and that may account for the resemblance of their cradles in form to those of birch bark made by the tribes of that northern region.

Structurally, they are in plain twined weaving, with here and there a row of wrapped twine and false braid. In passing, it may be noted that these Hupa babies are not strapped on a board as among the eastern tribes, nor are their heads bandaged as are those of the tribes along the coast of British Columbia.” (See fig. 107.)
Basket armor of the tribes on the Pacific Coast is made of narrow slats of wood, recalling those in the bottoms of some of the Lillooet Indian baskets in British Columbia. The slats are associated with straight rods of hard wood. These are woven with cords in regular twined weaving. The twine is finely spun and laid on so as to produce an ornamental effect upon the surface. This basket ornament has been

An examination of Hough’s Plates 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 14, and 15 will show how the weft of twine in basketry is transferred to slat armor worn anciently by the Tlinkit, Aleut, Takoo, Shasta, Hupa, and Klamath Indians was held together.

The Massawomekes, on the Chesapeake Bay, had similar basket shields or armor. Smith” speaks of them as made of little small sticks woven ‘* betwixt strings of thin hempe and silke grass,” but so firmly that no arrow could possibly pierce them. Comparing this description with the figure above leaves no doubt of the similarity of the defense on both sides of the continent.
Basketry, laying aside its chief function of holding something, is even now used extensively among many tribes in dress and adornment of the person. It was mentioned in the section on carrying that the exigencies of going about stimulated the inventive faculty not only in the basket industry but in other crafts accessory to travel. ‘The foremost of these companion arts is that of sandal or shoe maker. It is true that boots of hide and moccasins of tawed skin are the commonest supply of this want, but there is a vast portion of America where the sandal holds sway. They are made of tough fiber and woven in wicker, checker, twill, twined in a number of fashions. Some of the cliffdwellers’ sandals are studies in weaving three and even four ply. Many of them are figured ina paper on Primitive Travel and Transportation.’ (See Plate 87.)
But, far more than the feet, the head claims the basket weaver’s art the world over. In America the basket hat clings to the Pacific slope. As soon as the Indian area is reached in southeastern Alaska the hat bursts into bloom. It is made not only for comfort, to save the eyes of the hunter from the glare, and to act as an umbrella, but the handy weaver, having first scoured the earth for the most delicate spruce root, exhausts her artistic skill in its composition. The Tlinkit woman and the Haida woman solve the problem differently. Given the task to make the most elegant hat that can be done in spruce root, the Haida artist relies upon her delicate fingers to get the result. Twined weaving is her technic, but plain and twill and three-ply are so happily blended that she discards color. The Tlinket, just a whit less refined in touch, or maybe not having such perfect material, resorts to color. The designs are not always wrought, but are frequently painted, while beard of seal, abalone shell, and beads exhaust the possibilities of decoration. These hats are made for men as well as women. Indeed, the finest are doubtless made for men to wear on the chase, with the conviction that a hunter must not only do his best but wear his best.
The use of the basket in clothing reaches its climax in the California hats. In a description of the costume worn by Hupa Indians in

northern California a large collection of designs on their basket hats are shown in Plates 8, 4, and 5 in the Ray collection from the Hupa Reservation,“ and on Plate 6 of the same paper will be shown the relation of basketry to foot gear. (See Plate ss.)
Excepting the head gear and the foot gear, the American Indian in places needed protection from rain and cold. The robes made from the tender skins of rabbits and other small animals by cutting them into strips and making them into blankets by twined weaving were widely diffused in North America from Virginia to the Pacific. Wherever the tough cedar bark abounded soft capes and robes were made therefrom by the same women who made the baskets. The rain cloaks of middle America, if they are not of oriental origin, are knotted and do not belong to basketry. Other basketry dress was chiefly ornamental. Leggings reaching to the knees made up by well-known processes are to be found. A great deal of ceremonial regalia, even that from buckskin, is put together by basketmaker’s processes.
Basketry has been most useful as the patron of fine art and culture. Like all other human activities, it passes from the homely useful to the useless beautiful, and in so doing combines the two qualities whose union was long ago said to be the acme of excellence. The best art critics will say that in many of their productions the American Indian woman had, by obeying the voices within, attained a high degree of excellence. The practice of this superb work, and the admiration of it, elevated her; her abject state is not her fault.
There is no doubt that in the centuries of sorrow men have suffered more than women, since all their old occupations in which they excelled have been destroyed and hope with them; but the pride of excellence remained with the woman, who easily surpassed the whites in the work she was allowed to continue. That thousands of children are now being taught her art is witness of this.
Plate 89 shows two coiled baskets from Tulare County, California, specimens of the combined art of three or four well-known basketmaking stocks who have united at this point—the Shoshonean from the east, the Mission Indians from the south, and the makers of coiled basketry from the north. In the upper figure the basket bowl is in open sewing over a grass foundation, with ornamentation in plain vertical stripes. Every item of form, color, and design in this speci. men has in it the true element of art.
The lower basket is jar-shaped, in closer weaving and more uniform in texture, but its design is especially attractive. The base is a rectangular outline, but the pattern is made up of hourglass form
@Smithsonian Report, 1886, pp. 205-238.

<<<Page: 375>>>

flanked by two triangles. The body color is that of the material, the hourglass is black, and the triangles in reddish brown. Especial attention is called to this figure. It occurs many times in the basketry in the Merriam collection. It is also seen in McLeod’s specimens from the Kern County tribes. The symbolism is not known, nor is there any attempt at imitation of natural objects in these figures, which are natural size in the plate.
Plate 90 shows the resources of the western California tribes of Mendocino County for heightening the beauty of ordinary coiled basketry. The abalone shell, having been ground away from the back, the nacreous surface becomes one of the most beautiful natural objects. The beadlike ornamentation around the edges isthe money of the tribes, the feathers are the crests of the partridge, and forming the body of the basket the plumage of various species of birds is sewed on in bands. These objects, of course, have no other value than to show the taste and skill of the maker, and they are chiefly employed in making presents to friends, who are expected to give something quite as good in return.
Emulation in aesthetic ideals and technical skill, a potent factor in education and refinement, found unrestrained opportunity in basketry. It is doubtful whether pottery excelled this art in the demand for scrupulous care in every movement. Many of the best pieces in California ware are marked with the monogram of the maker; and these special marks are often at the bottom of a piece, as though the artist with consciousness of excellence had felt the Horatian thrill when the poet wrote: Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.
A sense of beauty in detail was the motive which led the basket maker to search the fields and dig into the earth for fiber. It educated her mind and sharpened her judgment. In order to secure the plume of the quail, the crest of the woodpecker, the shoulder tips of the blackbird, the mottled feathers of the duck, and more, the woman must catch her birds. So she becomes an inventor, more dangerous than the owl, more skillful than the hawk, more subtle than the serpent. At first the inventions were crude enough but effective in damming the waters and barricading the air. Ministering to these called forth a new grade of artificialities; culture grew by what it fed upon until it is not possible to comprehend in one grasp the multitude of materials, the variety of technical methods, the shapes, the designs and their meanings, involved in what one forlorn woman had to master in order to graduate in her art.
Dr. Washington Matthews” figures the so-called Navaho basket plaque as a drum, and says that the art of basket making is little cultivated among them to-day, because it was neglected through the development of blanket weaving. The. material is the twigs of the

<<<Page: 376>>>

aromatic sumac. The work is done in coiled weaving. The foundation is in roots of the same material, and in starting the basket the butt of the rod is placed in the center, the tip toward the periphery all the way to the end of the work Around the middle is a band in red, and branching from this band outward and inward triangles in black. The band is not continuous, but at one point is intersected by a narrow line of a colored wood. At first this seemed to be an imitation of the Pueblo ‘‘line of life” on pottery, but the Navaho line is put there to assist in the orientation of the basket in the medicine lodge when the light is dim. In playing their game the butts and tips of the Navaho give preference to the butt end of the gambling stick, associating the idea with that of the position of the warp in the coiled basket. When the basket is finished the butt of the first twig and the tip of the last twig in the outer edge must be on a line with this radial opening. When the basket is used in ceremony this line must lie east and west. The stick for this drum is made from the leaves of the yucca bent together, wrapped and sewed. The dull ghostly sound accords well with the other portions of their ceremonies.
The basket is closely connected with the Indian kitchen and dining room, if these terms be allowed. After the purveyor has gleaned from the waters, the air, the range, or the field, with appropriate devices, and the patient carrier has emptied her baskets at the tent side, and forsooth the miller has put through their exercises quite another series, the cook and caterer take up the burden. She is generally the selfsame woman who made the baskets and performed the forenamed drudgeries. But she is prepared for this task as well. There is first of all the mixing bowl or basket, about the shape of the bread trays in millions of kitchens. The coiled method suits the purpose, especially in their manufacture, since to be solid and water-tight are desirable, and weight is not an objection; yet there are tribes that make excellent mixing bowls in twined work. (See Plates 50, 58, 92..93.)
It must not be supposed that basketry cooking pots are placed over a fire, as one of metal. Great preparation and skill are necessary to success. The basket must be substantial and water-tight; the proper kinds of stones must be selected and cleaned. After heating to a high degree they must be dipped into water to reduce the heat. <A redhot stone would spoil the broth, sure enough. Tongs of wood of a certain species and bent just so must be made ready, and paddles for incessant stirring.“
“For illustrations of cooking with hot stones see W. H. Holmes, Report of the U.S. National Museum, 1900, pp. 170-173, pls. 9-15.

Plate 91 shows two of the best examples of Klikitat imbricated basketry. The foundation is seen in the basket exposed, consisting of a bundle of rude splints of cedar root; the sewing is with prepared splints of the same material, and in both figures it will be seen that no ornamentation ever occurs on the inside of this type. The method of laying on the outer ornamentation has already been explained in the earlier part of this paper.
The designs are made up of rectangular figures in the grass color for the body, with yellow material dyed with Oregon grape, cherry bark, and cedar bark. The designs represent in the upper figure geese migrating; the lower, some species of swamp plant.
The border of the lower figure is in false braid, laid on the upper row of sewing. The stains on the lower basket show that it has been used in gathering berries for a long time; the upper one has not yet seen use. Both of them, however, are vessels for gathering and cooking food.
This cooking with hot stones is mentioned by many older writers, which proves that it was not an innovation with the discovery of America. After the cooking of the food, the next thing was the serying of it, for which purpose there were a number of forms in basketry for holding the fish or mush and for the individual eater.
Plate 92 represents a collection of baskets used for preparing and serving food. The lower figure is a cooking basket in which either mush or fish can be prepared to eat by means of hot stones. Spoons are made from the horns of the Rocky Mountain sheep or goats, and may be used for the individual eater. The upper basket is for draining food or for holding fish or some hot substance and allowing the water to drain off. The other figure shows the method of twined weaving and introducing a new splint into the texture.
Plate 93 shows two of the meal trays of the Hopi Indians in northern Arizona. When the coils are left open, as in these examples, they are said to have been made by an unmarried woman. The base or foundation of the coil is the shreds of yucca stems and the sewing is done with the rib-like strips of the leaves. The colors used in dyeing are those employed also by the weavers in the same region, but of recent years common cheap dyes of traders have taken the place of the native colors. The mythology of the figures in the plaques is explained on page 353.
Plate 94, from a photograph by G. Wharton James, shows a young unmarried woman of the Oraibi pueblo preparing the corn meal for bread making. The chimney is interesting as a first chapter in the history of draft. Fire is built in the corner of the room and a few adobe bricks supported on a log of wood form the flue. A few pieces of brick on the upper part of the roof continue the chimney. Other utensils common in the pueblo lifeare seen. The young woman wears her hair in the fashion of the tribe.

Gleaning or harvesting, storing away, and milling, what a vast number of men are nowadays employed in them. Women are not absent from them altogether in the United States and nothing is more common in the Eastern Hemisphere than to see harvest tields and all activities associated with root and seed gathering thronged with them. The industry was almost solely hers in America. Baskets are named for their part in these crafts. There are picking baskets, root baskets, berry baskets, and on to the list of acorns, fruits, seeds, and roots without end. Carrying baskets are universal, but there are a great many of them used by this set of workwomen, and it will be found that special varieties have been devised for these pursuits.
Also, as every other important invention calls for a host of subsidiary devices, there must be wands for beating off seeds, sieves for separating grain from chaff, fans for the same purpose, roasting trays in which the raw material is parched before grinding. Brooms are made from basket fiber, hoppers for the top of the millstone also, and the open, generous bowls to hold meal. All this is before the cooking processes are reached. If the meal is not to be used up at once, all thrifty tribes had learned to store up vegetable supplies against the day of need. The granary basket was the rival of the pit and the wooden crib. There must have been something refining about this entire round of activities. In many of the baskets associated with them the ornamentation is exquisite. The hunter and the fisherman had scant encouragement to cultivate the wsthetic sense in their employments; but nuts, seeds, grain, most fruits, and roots are clean. Even berries when they stain do not soil the outer part of the receptacle, so the Fraser River tribes adorn the upper portion of the baskets with beautiful patterns. The lower part is left plain. The use of baskets in the plant quest was well-nigh universal. The eastern Indians employed the cane or split ash for their wicker or twilled baskets. As far as the cane extended, even to Guiana and Brazil, this is true. The ingenious cassava strainer belongs to this class.
Plate 95 shows the domestic utensils of the upper Amazon tribes for various household purposes. Palm leaf, out of which fiber is made; the fiber itself, used in various forms of domestic utensils; baskets in two types, twined and crossed warp weaving. The cassava strainer on the left is in twined weaving, so that when the weights are taxed the bag is increased in size and the water forced out of the cassava. The specimen shown was collected for the U.S. National Museum by J. B. Steere.
Lewis H. Morgan writes” that in the art of basket work, in all its varieties, the Iroquois Indian women also excel. Their baskets are

made with a neatness, ingenuity, and simplicity which deserve the highest praise. Splint is the chief material, but they likewise use a species of sweet grass, and also corn husks. Among these various patterns, which are as diversified as convenience or ingenuity could suggest, the most perfectly finished is the sieve basket. It is designed for sifting corn meal, to remove the chit and coarse particles after the corn has been pounded into flour. The bottom of the basket is woven in such fine checks that it answers very perfectly all the ends of the wire sieve. Another variety of baskets was made of corn husks and flags very closely and ingeniously braided. In their domestic economy the basket answered many purposes. Cat. Nos. 221161-3, U.S.N.M.
From the historians of the discovery it is learned that basketry was used in connection with the gathering and preparing of food. Bartram mentions the use of a sieve which the Indians of Georgia have for straining a ‘‘ cooling sort of jelly called conti, made by pounding certain roots in a mortar and adding water.” Dumont describes the sieves and winnowing fans of the Indians of Louisiana. ‘The Indian women, he says, make fine sieves with the skin which they take off of the canes; they also make some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and others without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. They also make baskets very neatly fashioned, cradles for holding maize. By comparing this statement with what is said about the California gleaners it will be seen that the Louisiana tribes knew how to sift meal, leaving the coarse particles inside the sieve, and also to separate seeds from chaff, and finally from coarse material, by beating over the edge of a tightly woven basket.
Du Pratz also says that for sifting the flour of their maiz, and for other uses, the natives make sieves of various finenesses of the splits of cane.
John Smith, speaking of the Indians of Virginia, says they use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the basket, receiue the flowr in a platter of wood scraped to that forme with burning and shels.
Strachey makes the following statement:
Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and in the morning pounding yt in a morter, they use a small baskett for the boulter or seaver, and when they have syfted fourth the finest, they pound againe the great, and so separating yt by dashing their hand in the baskett, receave the flower in a platter of wood, which, blending with water, ete.
There are no gleaning baskets in the Arctic and few in northern Canada. Birch, elm, and pine bark usurp the place of textile materials. But all along the southern border there were gleaners and a variety of basket forms in their hands. Maize, wild rice, roots, nuts, and berries were food staples. Checker matting, wicker basketry, and twined bagging supplied the receptacles.
For the basket maker there are four Alaskas:—Athapascan, and

<<<Page: 380>>>

Eskimo, where there is no gleaning or milling; Aleutian, in which the harvests come from the sea,and the daintiest of twined weaving is made in grass stems; and southeastern Alaska, which shall receive further notice. Storage baskets are attributed to them by early voyagers. Nowadays the ware is small, no piece exceeding half a bushel in capacity. Since seafaring is mixed with hunting and gleaning the fields, the gathering basket leads a busy life. Plates 136-149 represent the types, which, large and small, are chiefly cylindrical in shape. ‘The methods of manufacture and decoration have been described.
In Gerstaecker’s Journal is the following account of seed gatherers in California:
‘While I was standing there a couple of pretty, young girls came from the woods with flat baskets full of flower seed emitting a peculiar fragrance, which they also prepared for eating. They put some live coals among the seed, and, swinging it and throwing it together to shake the coals and the seed well and bring them to continual and close contact without burning the latter, they roasted it completely, and the mixture smelled so beautiful and refreshing that I tasted a good handful of it, and found it most excellent (p. 375).
Edwin Bryant, in his Rocky Mountain Adventures, gives this description of the acorn harvest:
We soon learned from them that they were a party engaged in gathering acorns, which to these poor Indians are what wheat and maize are tous. They showed us large quantities in their baskets under the trees. When dried and pulverized, the flour of the acorn is made into bread or mush, and is their ‘‘staff of life.’’? It is their chief article of subsistence in this section of California. Their luxuries, such as bull beef and horse meat, they obtain by theft, or pay for in labor at exorbitant rates. The acorn of California, from the evergreen oak (Quercus ilex), is much larger, more oily, and less bitter than on the Atlantic side of the continent. In fruitful seasons the ground beneath the trees is covered with nuts, and the Indians have the providence, when the produce of the oak is thus plentiful, to provide against a short crop and the famine which must necessarily result to them from it by laying up a supply greater than they will consume in one year (p. 240).
The Hupa Indians for collecting seeds, according to Prof. P. E. Goddard, use the basket in the shape of a common burden basket in closely woven style.“ They also made large storage baskets of closetwined work called djelo, the base being of greater diameter than the top,
Plate 96 represents the harvesting outfit of the Hupa Indians on Hupa Reservation in northwestern California. There is the openwork-twined basket for picking the seeds, the carrying basket in openwork with a decorated band at the top for bearing the crop home, the granary basket, which bears significantly on the outside the image of destructive worms that eat the crop after it is harvested. The woman’s head has a pad of soft-twined work on the forehead, across which the buckskin band of the carrying basket rests. The outtit of

the mill consists of a large basket at the bottom for catching the acorn meal and millstone set in this for grinding, a hopper basket, most elaborately made, resting on the rock to hold the acorns that are being ground. A similar hopper is shown below, both in its form and strueture. The pestle for grinding the acorns and the broom for sweeping up the meal complete the paraphernalia. Throughout the entire acorn area implements resembling these will be found.
The outfit for the Pomo acorn mush maker in Mendocino County, California, is illuctrated by V. K. Chesnut® in his paper on Plants Used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California (fig. 71 and Plates 18, 18), issued in 1902, by the Department of Agriculture, Washington.
It consists of eleven pieces: The picking basket for the individual gatherer; the holding basket for receiving the contents of number one; the cone-shaped carrying basket, with headband; the granary basket at the home, holding two or more bushels, many of them have beautiful covers; the basket hopper, open at the bottom to fit on the mortar stone, the work of strengthening these tax the ingenuity of the weaver; the mat for the meal to be placed under the millstone; the sifting plaques, in openwork for coarse separating and tightly woven, for shaking the waste over tke edge; the cooking pot of the closest weaving; the dipper; the eating bowls, and the daintily woven basket hat.
William H. Holmes illustrates at length the acorn harvesting and milling industry in northern California, carrying and hulling the nuts, pounding them in stone mortars, grinding the meal, separating the coarse particles, cleaning the meal by shaking and blowing, leaching in sand and using hot stones for cooking in basket pots.’
Plate 97 is a group of baskets in plain-twined weaving (Bamtush) in the collection of C. P. Wilecomb, of San Francisco. It consists of a conical carrying basket, mill hopper, granary basket, and mush bowl. The carrying basket is in plain-twined work throughout. Even the narrow bands near the top are no exception, for though each twist in the twine passes over two warp stems, on the next round the same two are included in the twist above. Casting the eye upward will show that in the upper band next to the border the same motive occurs, but the same pairs of stems are not inclosed in the twist. The effect of this ornament is quite pleasing, as the two bands with intervening space form an endless zigzag pattern. The border of this basket is formed by bending the warp stems down as the foundation of a coiled work which is strengthened by a hoop of wood. The bands of ornamentation on this and the other baskets in this group is explained under ** Symbolism.”

The mill hopper is also in plain-twined weaving, strengthened with three narrow bands of tee weaving. The granary basket and the mush bowl are noteworthy especially on account of the peculiar method of finishing the work by merely cutting off the warp stems.
Plate 98 represents two specimens in the collection of C. P. Wilecomb, both of them from Tulare County, California. The upper figure isa bow| connected with body in twined weaving. The diameter is 142 inches. The ornamentation is in four bands, the lower broken, the second in chevron pattern, the third human figures, the fourth the standard hourelass pattern. On the margin are spots in black material in groups of fours. The lower figure represents a typical mortar stone with pestle and hopper, in this case glued to the upper surface of the millstone. The ornamentation on the upper is also the standard band of hexagonal figures.
Plate 99 represents a Yokut woman on the Tule River Reservation shaking acorn meal and sifting it for making mush.
In Plate 100, the same collection, is represented a Havasupai (Yuman) Indian woman screening corn in a roasting basket with hot stones and blowing out the chaff, using the specimen both for parching and cleaning the seeds.
Plate 101 shows a Coahuilla (Shoshonean) woman grinding acorn flour on a mortar stone, on the top of which has been cemented a hopper basket with open bottom. This method of grinding is extremely old, inasmuch as some of the pieces of ancient baskets in prehistoric graves, found by Mr. Pepper and others, are in this type and stitch of basketry.
Speaking of the Apache Indians and others farther south, Capt. John G. Bourke mentions their fanning trays for grinding the seeds of grasses. Hot stones are placed in them, with the coarse material and the chaff is burned out. The Captain also mentions that the trays are wet to keep them from burning. This can not be a universal practice, because in some of the specimens in the Museum the texture is very much charred.
Plate 102 shows the most primitive form of storage, holding several bushels, used by the Mohave Indians in the desert between Mexico and southern Arizona. It resembles more a bird’s nest than a textile preparation. The specimen is in the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, and to the courtesy of C. L. Owen and G. C. Simms I am indebted for the photograph.
The Mohave and other tribes have curious granaries for storing mesquite beans, corn, etc., near their houses. A platform is constructed on high poles; upon this is placed a round, bottomless basket from 3 to 5 feet in diameter and 2 to 3 feet deep. These are made of arrow-weed stalks tightly interwoven. When filled the top is sealed with mud to keep out rain. In specimens examined by Owen

<<<Page: 383>>>

and Simms, of the Field Columbian Museum, several of these nest-like baskets were clustered on the same platform and a rude fence served for inclosure.@
House and furniture were here and there constructed of basket work, so the basket maker became architect and cabinetmaker. Of the former, the wall may have been constructed like a huge, coarse basket, with upright stakes for warp and brush, canes, rushes, or leaves of palm for weft. The roof, also, especially in its framework, was in some tribes an immense shallow basket bottom inverted. The rafters were the parallel or radiating warp and the interlacing vines the openwork woof into which many kinds of thatch were fitted.
Accessory to the house, whether a woven structure or not, were fences, awnings, screens, and shelters. They were woven after the fashion of the walls. In middle America and the tropical portions of South America, but far more skillfully in the Philippine Islands and all about the Indo-Pacific, the mat and light basketry serve for seclusion and decoration among the houses. Open checkerwork, twilled weaving, wattling, or twined textile are as effective as they are light and easily put together. When they were moving about, or in situations where a compact dwelling would have been burdensome, it was an affair of only a few moments to imitate the nest-building birds and throw together a wickiup or leaf shelter of some kind.
The winter houses of the Pomo Indians were a rude kind of feathered basketry. They are described by Carl Purdy? as domes of wickerwork, thatched heavily with grass or tules (p. 443, with illustration). The summer houses were of wickerwork covered with boughs, and the tribe moved several times a year as acorns, fish, game, or dry quarters were desirable. They solved the problems of transportation by moving themselves about.
Furniture had not the pretentious meaning that it possesses in civilization. The bed for the Indians was the most desirable luxury. Their chairs were mats of many styles of weaving and many colors. All of them were plicated by hand and were the production of the basket maker.
But the bed was not always a basket. In the North it was the warmest fur and robes; in many tribes the mat took the place of the robe, and over a wide area the hammock was chair by day and bed at night. In some of these the twine is knotted or netted and the hammock is in no sense a basket. Throughout the Southwest a resting device is formed by the very ancient basket-makers’ process of stringing a number of stiff rods together by three or more rows of weaving. (For a Hopi bridal costume case see Plate 103.)

The basket is intimately associated with Indian life in the ** last act.” Not only fabrics woven in basketry technic were wrapped about the dead and used to protect the body, but on the sentimental side examples of the finest workmanship were either deposited or burned with their makers. Plate 104 is taken from Pepper’s account of the basketmaking Indians of Utah, and is interesting as exhibiting the method of burial among the ancient tribe of southeastern Utah in the canyon country. These old people must have lived long in these curious retreats, for on top of their graves are found deposits made by later tribes. The corpse was placed in the hollow of a rock, covered with a rabbit-skin robe made in twined weaving. On top of all was turned upside down a coiled basket. The plate shows the method of administering the blanket and the basket, and the lower figure of the plate declares the type and style of weaving used by these ancient basket
makers. The foundation is of three-rod type. The four figures on the surface near the margin are like the butterfly design seen on some modern ware, but the symbol is not known. Horatio N. Rust tells of a young Indian girl who was dying of consumption. She wore on her person a small basket of beautiful workmanship and gave it to a young American, begging him to have her buried in a coffin and the little basket placed within.
Another Indian, Roherio by name, living in the southern California country, tells of his wife, who, when dying, called him to her and said: Take my basket cap, which I have always worn since I have been your wife, and burn it, with everything that is mine. He obeyed her and burned two trunks full of personal property. >
Clarence King describes vividly, in his Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevadas, a cremation scene:
In the opening between the line of huts a low pile of dry logs had been carefully laid, upon which, outstretched and wrapped in her blanket, lay the dead form of “*Sally,”’ the old basket maker, her face covered in careful folds. Upon her heart were the grass-woven water bowl and her latest papoose basket. The flames slowly lapped over, consuming the blanket, and caught the willow papoose basket. When the husband saw this the tears streamed from his eyes; he lifted his hands eloquently, looking up at the sky and uttering heartbroken sobs. All of the Indians intoned in pathetic measure, ‘‘ Himalaya, Himalaya,” looking first at the mound of fire and then out upon the fading sunset.
The desert region of Peru was favorable to the preservation of delicate textiles, and it is in the cemeteries of this region that large quantities of basketry in every style of weaving here described have been found.“ (For lace work see Plate 105.)

Pottery and basketry were in America, especially among the savage tribes, both the work of women. Before answering the question how far one art was useful to the other, attention must be called to the fact that in eastern United States both prevailed almost universally. In the Arctic, excepting the rude pottery of Alaska on Bering Sea, and on the Pacific from Mount St. Elias to Santa Barbara Islands, the tribes made only basketry. ‘Those of the interior basin and all southward were expert in both.
It was formerly believed that in the eastern division of the United States, especially, pottery was made to a large extent in basketry. Eminent students held this opinion and there seemed to be abundant evidence of its truth. Cushing figures a basket with clay inside to protect the former in the cooking of seeds and grains.@
Holmes now believes that the extent to which good baskets were used for modeling pottery in this province has been greatly overestimated. There are innumerable examples of basketry and other textile markings on earthenware, and he divides them into five classes.
1. Impressions from the surface of rigid textile forms.
2. Impressions from cloth and nets.
3. From woven textures used over the hand or modeling implement.
4. From cords wrapped about modeling paddles or rocking tools.
5. Impressions of bits of cords or other textile units, singly or in groups, applied for ornament only and so arranged as to produce textile-like patterns.
In modeling a clay vessel a basket might be used as a support and pivot. It might assist in shaping the bodies of vessels, assuming to a limited extent the limits of a mold. Also, the mat upon which a plastic form rests will leave impressions that firing will render indelible. The tribes of the Pima linguistic family produce jars and baskets of the same shape; but if a row of Zuni or the Hopi pottery be compared with a row of their basketry they would not suggest that either one
yas the predecessor and occasion of the other. Laying aside the inquiry whether the basket was the progenitor of the pot, inasmuch as the same hands often produced both, the former unwittingly rendered itself immortal by its many little helpful attentions to the latter in its formative stage. The pot was afterwards fired and worn out and broken into fragments that were buried out of sight. In these last years the archeologist exhumes the shards, washes them carefully, and makes casts of their surfaces in plaster or artist’s clay. A glance shows that, though the surfaces of the shards are much worn away by time, the lines in the little cavities are as sharp as when the clay and

<<<Page: 386>>>

the basket made each other’s acquaintance centuries ago. (See Plates 106, LOT.)
In the shards examined by Eggers and Holmes one fact is preserved that no historian recounts, namely, that twined basketry as varied and beautiful as that of the Aleutian Islanders was made by the tribes in the Mississippi Valley before the fifteenth century.
Very few of the Indian tribes of America were so unsettled in life as to be without a home. About such a place accumulated personal property and provisions for the future, large and small. On the Great Plains of the West, receptacles were made of rawhide gaudily painted. On the MacKenzie drainage, bark of the white birch was the material, decorated with quills of the porcupine dyed in many colors. But for holding the bone awl and the sinew thread, the trinkets belonging to dress, the outfits of fisherman and hunter, the basket and the wallet were well-nigh universal. In the industries and other activities of life in which materials, utensils, apparatus, in a word, things were involved, there were receptacles for holding them. The basket maker herself has a kit of appliances for making her wares.
One of the primary functions of basketry, if not the very first, was to contain or restrain something. The weir, fence, wing of the game drive, wall of the house, besides many smaller objects of the donneeet weave were invented long before basketry became cooking utensils or works of ceremony. The myriads of Indian baskets sold at railroad stations and summer resorts have gone back to first principles and are made for the sole purpose of holding.
In the north the small tools of the fur worker and trinkets are easily lost in the snow. The workbasket or something in its stead is universal. About Point Barrow the Tinné (Athapascan) Indians make coiled baskets in several styles of weaving. These are traded to the Eskimo. On the Bering seacoast of Alaska rougher trinket cases appear. The Attu makers of dainty wallets in grass, living a ay out on the Aleutian chain, are quite as skillful in the manufacture of cigar cases, which, by the way, are nothing more than two of their old-fashioned cylinders fitted one into the other and flattened. Receptacles of basket wood, with no other function than just to hold things, are to be found in all the areas of the Western Hemisphere, in all sizes from the granary down to the sheath for an awl, in every one of the technical processes and in every degree of fineness. It is the one function of universal application.
Plate 108 is an ammunition holder in twined basketry from the Tlinkit Indians of Sitka, Alaska. It is ornamented by false embroidery. The interesting fact concerning this specimen is that as soon as these Indians came in contact with the Russians they began to imitate

<<<Page: 387>>>

modern forms of apparatus in textile material. This telescope basket was used by the owner for holding caps, bullets, or other delicate objects for hunting. It also shows that the acculturation of form did not begin recently, but took place as soon as the Indian woman’s eye rested upon some novel and attractive form. This specimen is Catalogue No. 1156 in the U. 8. National Museum and was collected by James G. Swan.
Plate 109 represents a woman’s workbasket of the Tlinkit Indians, of southeastern Indians, in twined weaving, ornamented in false embroidery. Doubtless the form is derived from Russian motives, but it is extremely common among the Indians in this locality and is useful ina thousand ways for holding material. This specimen was collected in Sitka, Alaska, by J. J. McLean.
The Fraser River tribes in British Columbia illustrate also what is said about the power of suggestion in modifying form, and even structure, in an art. The bulk of their stalwart baskets are made for cooking and harvesting apparatus. But where the Hudson Bay Company’s and Malayo-Pacific packages came into view, another class of baskets appeared, fashioned in their shapes and ornamented over their entire surfaces. (See Plates 43 and 44.)
The one who carried the sacred basket in the Greek religious processions was called the Kanephoros, and it will be remembered that in the consecration of Aaron and his family to the priesthood, among the multitude of paraphernalia was the basket of shew bread.¢
In one tribe, at least, of American aborigines—the Hopi of northeastern Arizona—bread consecrated to the service of religion is set before the altar in beautiful plaques of coiled and wicker basketry, on which the emblems of religion are wrought in colors.
By religion is meant beliefs about a spirit world, with all its inhabitants and their relations with mankind; this is creed, and cult, or worship. ‘* The best for the gods” is the talisman in the rudest faiths as inthe highest. So it will be found that basketry devoted to religion is worthy of its object.
In the autumn, during the months of September and October, the Hopi Indians of northeastern Arizona celebrate their basket dances. They have been studied by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes and J. G. Owen. The basket dance is a public exhibition, closing a series of secret rites, the whole festival being called Zalakonti. It is rather a posturing of the body in rhythm, together with songs, during which baskets are carried by women or thrown as gifts among the assembled spectators.
Those taking part in these dances are in two groups—the basket
« Leviticus, viii, 2.

ABORIGINAL AMERICAN BASKETRY. iw e
bearers, or chorus, and the basket throwers, or Lakone manas. The only man participating is a priest called the Lahone tuku.
The costumes of the participants, the method of holding and throw: ing the baskets, and the struggles of the men for the specimens are all carefully described by Dr. Fewkes.“
In archeological studies at the Chevlon ruins, about 15 miles east of Winslow, Arizona, a large amount of basketry was found in the graves. Much of it had the form of plaques like those still used in Oraibi and the Middle Mesa. The inhabitants of the old pueblos at Chaves Pass were also clever basket makers, and had the same beliefs as their descendants concerning the kinship and close relationships of life between spirit beings and men.
With reference to these basket dances, Dr. Hough says the baskets used are shallow, circular trays, either coiled or wicker, invariably of Hopi manufacture and all decorated in colors. The designs on the Lalaukonti baskets are various, and there seems to be a greater use of symbolic figures than in those specimens commonly offered for sale. In some examples the designs are conventionalized merely to the extent of adapting them to the field of the basket and the exigencies of the weaving. In most cases, however, the design is in the last stages of convention and the original motive is lost.
Plate 110 shows the portion of the Hopi Za/akonti ceremony in which the baskets are introduced by the young women.
The uses of baskets of the plaque type by the Moki may throw light on the reason for their occurrence in the ‘‘basket dances.” In the household these plaques are devoted to various purposes; ground meal is heaped upon them in high cones by the grinders, or dry food, such as piki bread or dried peaches, is served in them. A basket being difficult and laborious in construction and high priced, besides being easily soiled and unsuitable for the uses to which pottery is put, is employed in cases of nicety, or, one might say, of luxury. Whenever presents are exchanged it is proper to carry them on basket trays.
Baskets form an important part of the paraphernalia of the religious fraternities, being used to at least as great an extent as pottery for containing sacred meal, the prayer-stick offerings, ete. Usually new plaques are prepared for sacred use upon the altars and in the service of the fraternities, notably the Zulakont/. It may be found that plaques are almost entirely of ceremonial import.
Sometimes baskets are placed on the walls of rooms as a decoration. This was observed at Sichomovi, where a frieze of Cohonino baskets decorated a room in the house of Wa lu tha ma.
The use of baskets in religious ceremonies by the Navaho Indians is described in Dr. Matthews’s paper, The Mountain Chant, « Navaho

Ceremony. (See page 515.) Among the Yaquis of northern Mexico baskets are used for holding palms, which they use in their sacred ceremonies. The Hupa Indians, on the Hupa Reservation, in one of their dances hold baskets in their hands, examples of which were

Prof. P. E. Goddard” describes the use of this basket in the ceremony. (See Plate 111).
Baskets played a role in the etiquette of the Indians. The Choctaws, in sending a gift of fruit, use a heart-shaped basket to convey a sentiment of sincerity. (See Plate 134.) The wedding basket of the Pomos is an exquisite production in twined weaving. During a marriage festivity the bride’s mother presents her son-in-law with a large, handsome basket, which he must immediately fill with cakes and pine sugar for the guests. It is thereafter known as chi-m6 pi-kaé, or dowry. On such occasions the artist is incited by a combination of powerful motives to do her best. Among the same Indians the gift basket, presented by the maker as a token of friendship, is a masterpiece not only in fineness, but in the exquisite sentiments of its design. In the National Museum are good examples both of the wedding and of the gift baskets. (See Plates 112-114.)
The Gualala style of gambling, says Powers, prevails all over the state, but the Tulare have another sort, which pertains exclusively to the women. It is a kind of dice throwing, and is called U-chu-us. For a dice they take half of a large acorn or walnut shell, filf it level with pitch and pounded charcoal, and inlay it with bits of bright-colored abalone shells. For a dice table they weave a very large, fine basket tray, almost flat, and ornamented with devices woven in black or brown,

mostly rude imitations of trees and geometrical figures. Four squaws sit around it to play, and a fifth keeps tally with fifteen sticks. There are eight dice and they scoop them up with their hands and dash them into the basket, counting one when two or five flat surfaces turn up. (See Plates 115, 116.)
The rapidity with which the game goes forward is wonderful, and the players seem totally oblivious to all things in the world beside. After each throw that a player makes she exclaims yef-n7 (equivalent to ‘‘one-y”), or w7-a-tak, or ko-maz-ch, which are simply a kind of singsong or chanting. One old squaw, with scarcely a tooth in her head, one eye gone, her face all withered, but with a lower jaw as of iron, and features denoting extraordinary strength of will—a reckless old gambler, and evidently a teacher of the others—after each throw would grab into the basket and jerk her hand across it, as if by the motion of the air to turn the dice over before they settled, and ejaculate wiatak. It was amusing to see the savage energy with which this fierce old hag carried on the game. ‘The others were modest and spoke in low tones, but she seemed to be unaware of the existence of anybody around her. “ ;
The plates show two varieties of the Yokut gambling trays, the flat and the dished. The former is in the National Museum, collected by W. H. Holmes; the latter is in the C. P. Wilcomb collection, collected on the Tule River.
One of the earliest and most primitive uses of basketry textile was in connection with the capture of animals. In a paper on traps published by the Smithsonian Institution,’ the word trap is defined as ‘‘an invention for inducing animals to commit self-incarceration, selfarrest or suicide.” The basketry traps are used principally for penning or impounding animals and not for killing them. In every one of the areas mentioned, coarse wickerwork or twined weaving are used in this function and there is little doubt that many of the very finest processses of weaving by hand were derived originally from coarse work of this character.
The Pomo Indians make a trap for catching fish from Juncus effusus. The interesting feature about these objects is that they are a gross production in brush of the rare Mohave carrying basket, in which the weft is wrapped once about each warp element in passing.

Nearly everywhere throughout the Western Hemisphere the Indian was encamped near springs of water, and in his journeys about for hunting and other purposes knew always where to obtain it. An exception to this is the arid region of the western portion of the United States.
Among the Shoshonean tribes and in the pueblos, seeking out, carrying, and storing water was the chief industry and most of the religious ceremonies and prayers were with reference to rain.
The canteen and the larger carrying jar among the sedentary tribes was of pottery, but with the Utes, Apaches, and other unsettled tribes these vessels were of water-tight basketry made with round or conical bottom, so that in settling on a level the center of gravity would bring the vessel into an upright position and thereby keep the water from spilling. (Plates 82, 33.)
The transportation and storage of drinking water is one of the functions of pottery. Aquarius, the water bearer of the sky, is repre_sented with a jar in his hands, and the spirits that haunt the springs in classic mythology are all of them friends of the potter. The Indians of the Atlantic area were well supplied with water and had vessels of clay. The Eskimo made bottles of sealskin; so did the tribes of the Pacific coast as far south as the Columbia. But in the interior Basin of the United States, Indians of the Shoshoean, Athapascan, and Yuman families substitute basketry for pottery in their canteens, jugs, pitchers, and small tanks. These are made in coiled or twined ware, and sealed with pine tar in the north and asphaltum in the south. It is probably owing to the unsettled life of these tribes that they out and out invented this ingenious substitute for fictile ware. There is no lack of clay, for pueblos in the midst of the region are the last strongholds of Keramos in America. And there was in pre-historic times no lack of pottery there, as the supply of charming whole pieces and precious fragments bear witness.
The most interesting connection of hydrotechny with basketry was discovered in a cliff-dwelling 3 miles north of White River Agency, on the White Mountain Apache Reservation, Arizona, by Charles L. Owen, of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago. On the floor of the cavern baskets were built without bottoms. The warp was of willow shoots with the leaves on. The weft was in juniper and willow twigs in twined weaving or wattling. The interstices were filled with puddled clay, to make them useful for receptacles of water, which had to be transported from the canyon 300 feet below. An example brought away, No. 68876 in the Field Museum, measures 4 feet 10 inches in diameter and is 15 to 20 inches in height. (See Plate 102.)
The occurrence of basketry water receptacles is a good problem in

<<<Page: 392>>>

the study of the parallelogram of subjective and objective forces which originated and developed special arts in primitive times every where. In this particular example, the originators of cement-tightened baskets had good textile material, knew the arts of weaving them, were on the move in desert countries where water sources were far apart, and could easily secure the pine sap or the asphaltum for tightening purposes.
Plate 117 illustrates the water jug or pitcher of larger size, called O-oats by the Paiutes. Most of these are in coiled weaving, but even there a variety of technic is shown both in the foundation and in the sewing.
The upper figure is a pitcher-shaped water carrier with globular body, used also for holding seed. The coiled foundation is of two or more rods, the stitches are wide apart and overlap in what is called in Pomo, fsa¢ work. The border is in oblique coiled sewing, and the handle is an afterthought set on the neck. Its height is 10 inches. This specimen, Cat. No. 11249 in the National Museum, was collected in southern Utah by Major J. W. Powell.
The lower figure is a much neater specimen in which the foundation isa single rod and in sewing the stitches simply interlock with those underneath, giving » very much more regular form to the surface. The border is in oblique coiled sewing. There are lugs on the side for the purpose of carrying, and the headband is of soft deerskin. This specimen is Cat. No. 11876 in the U.S.N.M., and also was collected in southern Utah by Major J. W. Powell.
The Powell collection contains a large number of these carrying jars in coiled work. They differ in the form of the body somewhat and in the length and shape of the neck, but im other respects, in structure and function, they are the same.
Plate 118 shows two Navaho Indian girls carrying water in their tusjehs, or basket jars, after G. Wharton James.“ The photograph is interesting also in illustrating the two methods of suspending burdens employed by the Indians. The girl on the right has a band across the top of her head; while the one in the rear supports the load from her shoulders. The latter method is also common in the south, especially in Mexico. The baskets are made in coiled weaving and dipped in pitch to make them water-tight. .

The technical processes, the decorations, and the symbolism that
may exist in the single basket having been scrutinized, it is in order to examine the geographic distribution of these forms in relation to ethnology and environment. Geography has much to do with human enterprises. It does not furnish the ingenious mind nor the skillful hand, but it does supply their materials for their exercise and set bounds in which the mind and hand soon discover how to reach their best.
America was, in aboriginal times, unequally occupied by native peoples. On the Atlantic slope in both continents vast areas were in possession of single linguistic groups called families. On the Pacitic slope there were also a few influential families, but the rule was otherwise. Wedged in among the mountains wherever there was an inclosure abounding in food supply there were crowded what seemed to be shriveled remnants of once larger peoples, or fragments of disrupted families.
At once arises the query, Did they bring with them and preserve uncontaminated the stitches and patterns of their priscan basketry and keep the ancient models unchanged? It is to be feared that they did not, and that is why the ethnologist becomes embarrassed in trying to

<<<Page: 395>>>

harmonize ethnology and technology. There are, notwithstanding, certain general effects which may be associated with definite peoples.
1. In the Eastern province the prevailing families were Algonquian, Iroquoian, Muskhogean, Caddoan, and a few remnants of smaller ones, in some instances numbering at present less than a hundred persons. The Siouan and other buffalo-hunting tribes on the plains will be omitted because the hide of the slain animals furnished them with receptacles as well as other conveniences of life. The basket makers in their territory belong elsewhere.
2. In the Alaskan province an interesting state of affairs existed with reference to the matter here investigated. In the interior of the peninsula are the Athapascan (or Tinné) tribes. Around the coast line dwell members of the Eskimauan family, having entirely different materials, workmanship, and technical processes. It will be seen later that the Eskimo as a whole are not skillful basket makers. There has been contact, however, between the two linguistic families. The Aleutian peoples are very different in this art from the Eskimo, their ware being among the most highly admired on the continent. In southeastern Alaska the Koloschan family are found, who are different from the Athapascans in the interior of the peninsula in that they do not make coiled basketry at all. The same is true of the Haida or Skittagetan family, in the Queen Charlotte Archipelago.
3. In the Frazer-Columbia province, including the drainage of these great rivers, the Salishan family, the Wakashan, the Shahaptian, and the Chinookan are the present basket-making families. As in the Siouan areas, so here a few small fragments or survivals fill in the gaps and waste places, but contribute little to the technical processes involved. In the discussion of basketry in this province a special characteristic will be brought out.
4. The California province, including also southern Oregon, is the most mixed of all in its ethnology. Many stocks of people whose languages are not known elsewhere, and many fragments of stocks that have a larger existence in other parts of America, are wedged into the mountain valleys and drainages of the streams. Nature has been most lavish here in her materials, and the finest textile plants for making baskets are to be found in California. The diversity of technic is almost as great as that of language. Few styles of weaving or coiling exist that do not have their representatives among this interminable labyrinth of valleys.
5. The Desert, or Interior province, is occupied in its northern portion by the great Shoshonean family, which extends from the forty-ninth parallel to Costa Rica, pushes its way over the Rocky Mountains into the Mississippi drainage and across southern California to the Santa Barbara islands on the Pacific coast, giving and receiving technical suggestions in its way. In the southern portion of this

<<<Page: 396>>>

interior province, Athapascan tribes, the Navaho and the Apache, the Yuman, and the Piman family are basket makers.
6. The sixth province includes Middle and South America, not because all the basketry in these regions is on the same plane, but owing to the small collections received from these quarters. A great portion of it isin the Torrid zone, where palm leaf and tough cane and reeds await the basket maker. There will be missine the characteristics of the North American tribes, and also local weaves will appear worthy of study.”
Unlike pottery, this fabric is not destroyed by frost, so that wherever textile material could be obtained there was no meteorological reason why the basket should not be forthcoming. The Athapascans of Alaska and northwestern Canada, possessed of both willow and spruce root, at once developed the coiled ware which their descendants, the Apache, are still making in Arizona.
East of the Rocky Mountains, in the Atlantic drainage of Canada and the United States, at the present time checker and willow work are practiced almost universally; but in the mounds of the Ohio Valley quite well diffused twined ware is found. The Gulf province afforded excellent cane (Arundinaria macrosperma, Arundinaria gigantea, Arundinaria tecta), and here, both in ancient times and in modern, diagonal plaiting of basketry and matting was prevalent in all tribes. The Plains province in its central portion relied chiefly on the hide of animals for its receptacles. But around its borders will be found intrusive processes of manufacture in twined, diagonal and coiled workmanship.
On its Pacific slopes North America is the home of basketry. From Attu, the westernmost island of the Aleutian chain, to the borders of northern Mexico is to be found practically every type of this art.
In Middle America, including southern Mexico and the Central American States, pottery was exalted among receptacles, and excellent fibers usurped the function of the coarser pliable materials of basketry.
Owing to differences of climate, rainfall, and other characteristics of environment, the materials for basketry vary greatly from region to region throughout America, and this in spite of all ethnic considerations. Again, the motives for the use of basketry differ from place to place, so much so that peoples of one blood make one ware in this place and another in that. Finally, however, it must never be for-

gotten that the ideas, utilitarian and artistic, in the minds of the manufacturers themselves, serve to bestow special marks upon the work of different tribes so as to give to them ethnic or national significance under any circumstances. In the following chapters the typical forms of the various families of Indians will be illustrated.
Were there no mixture of tribes it might be possible to state in every case the maker of each specimen from the technic and the ornamentation, though this opinion must be held with reserve. Throughout the entire continent the practice of capturing women was common; in each case the stolen ones carried to their homes the processes they had been familiar with in their native tribe. The Twana Indians on Puget Sound practice ten different methods of basket making; the Pomo Indians have eight processes; the Hopi Indians of Arizona have at least five. It is well known that each one of these tribes belong to synthetic families. In order to comprehend the extent of this relationship between the tribe and the art, the various basket-making groups will be defined and the types of their work illustrated. (See Plates 154, 155.)
The mixing of basket work through the traveling about of women is well illustrated in the story of Maria Narcissa, told by E. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield, California. Maria was born at San Gabriel mission and brought up in Tejon Canyon. There she retained the knowledge of her native speech and learned the dialects of the surrounding tribes. She married an American, reared and educated a large family of children, and is still living. On her testimony tribes from the north as far up as Tule River would come down to Tejon for social and religious purposes, hold great feasts and dances, and gamble on the gaming plaques. Parties came longer journeys from San, Fernando, San Gabriel, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Santa Inez, and Mr. McLeod finds undoubted evidences of these meetings in the technic and the decorations on basketry. (See Plates 115-116.)
From the Tule River country there came the beautiful flexible work, an improvement on the Fresno ware. But the Tejon basketry excelled, the pieces were better finished, there was more emulation, a greater variety of patterns, showing the influence of both north and south.
There was trading of materials likewise, for you will see fine old pieces from the caves on the Tejon with mission bottoms and Tejon tops, also old specimens from caves in Santa Barbara County which were made in Tejon.

For thus the tale was told
By a Penobscot woman
As she sat weaving a basket,
A basket or abaznoda
Of that sweet-scented grass
Which Indians dearly love. —CHARLES GODFREY LELAND.
Kastern North America will include the tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. Many of them are now basket makers, but archeology is doing excellent service in helping to complete a map of this area in order to determine the distribution of the various technical processes that obtained in aboriginal times. The few types of the art that now survive must not be taken as covering the ground of ancient weaves. The recovery of the latter by the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Peabody Museum, and other explorations is one of the most wonderful contributions of the spade to the ethnologist. Though basketry was anciently made of grass, hemp fiber, bark, young stalks, and sapwood, and for that reason is the most perishable of human manufactures, under favorable conditions salt mines, nitrous caves, the desert’s aridity, metallic earths, and even fire have kindly preserved enough of the delicate textures to reveal the processes of weaving in vogue many centuries ago.
Indian women in the Mississippi Valley used to decorate the outsides of clay vessels by pressing string and basketry products on the soft material before burning. Thus they preserved the record of the art for all time. By applying modeler’s clay to these ancient fragments the texture is at once revealed. In Popular Science Monthly“ will be seen account of experiments with these sybilline shards, by George E. Sellers. William H. Holmes simultaneously made larger investigations and published accounts of experiments by him on Mound Builders and other ancient pottery of this area.? He varefully washed the fragments of their ware and made casts of the outer surface. The result was astonishing. Natural forces had eaten away and greatly obscured the marks of textiles on the outside surface of the shards, but in the bottom of the cavities, filled for centuries with earth, the impressions have been carefully preserved, and ‘‘the manner in which the fabric in all its details of plaiting, netting, and
weaving were constructed can be brought out quite as graphically as
Viol: el Siipaole: Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1884, pp. 393-425.

though one were examining the surface of the original vessels.” On the surfaces of rocks the paleo-botanist discovers the delicate impressions of leaves. In these indelible lines he reads the names of species of trees that grew millenniums ago. So, through these impressions on potsherds the archeologist is able to discover lost arts of whose existence all other evidence has perished. (See Plate 107.)
All along our northern frontier and in many parts of Canada the Iroquois and Chippewa now fabricate baskets from the ash, birch, linden, and other white woods and the vernal or sweet grass (Swristuna odorata). The method of manufacture is universally the same; it is the plainest in-and-out checker and wicker weaving. (See Plates 117 and 121). The basketry is far from monotonous, however, for the greatest variety is secured by difference of form, of color, of the relative size of the parts, and of ornamentation. In form the baskets run the whole gamut as among the Haida and Makah, guided by the maker’s fancy and the demands of trade. These Indians all live on the border of civilization and derive a large revenue from the sale of their wares. The colors are of native manufacture—red, yellow, blue, green, alternating with the natural color of the wood. To begin with the rudest, let us take a dozen or sixteen strips of paper half an inch wide and cross them so as to have one-half perpendicular to the other half, woven in checker at the center and extending to form the equal arms of a cross. Bend up these arms perpendicular with the woven checker and pass a continuous splint similar to the framework round and round ina continuous coil from the bottom to the top. Fit a hoop of wood to the top, bend down the upright splints over this, and sew the whole together with a whipping of splint, and you will have the type basket. (See figs. 9 and 10 on Plate 119.) Now, by varying the width of the splint used to cover the sides a great difference of appearance is secured. The complete operation among the Menominees was studied out by W. J. Hoffman,” and will be seen in figs. 110 to 114. In the National Museum are baskets made of uniformly cut splints not over one-sixteenth of an inch in width. —
Finally, the Algonkin, as well as the Southern Indians, have learned to decorate baskets with a great variety of rolls, looking much like the napkins on the table of a hotel. The weaver draws a splint under the warp stick, gives it a turn up and down, or two turns in different directions, and draws the loose end tightly under the next warp stick but one. This operation is repeated, forming around the basket one or more rows of projecting ornaments. Morgan bears testimony to the skill of the Lroquois women in the art.?
The basket woman at her work sits upon the ground in front of her lodge, or frequently of a little booth or shelter—the first step in the
“Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1896, p. 260. The League of the Iroquois, 1851, pp. vi-55.

evolution of the artist’s studio. The materials which she gathered long ago with much pains, and has been hoarding up, are within easy reach. Her hands and her teeth are both available in her work, aided by only a small supply of tools. A number of Indian women at work will be seen in different connections throughout this paper.
Plate 120 shows Caroline Masta, an Abenaki Indian woman from Pierreville, Canada, seated in her humble laboratory at Belmar, New Jersey. Her materials are of black ash (/7axinus nigra) and sweet grass (Savastana odorata). The former has been worked out by machinery in Canada, and is piled up around her; the latter is gathered and braided by her relatives, and sent to her all ready for the last step in manufacture. This Indian woman conducts a thriving business, not being able to make up ware as fast as there is demand for it. Specimens of her work are shown in Plate 119, photographed by Herbert B. Rowland.
To illustrate more fully the survival of the old art in the new era, Plate 121 represents three Chippewa women near Saginaw, Michigan, making splint baskets. They are seated no longer in the midst of wretchedness, but in an apple orchard. The clothesline and the receptacles filled with fruit mark the changed life. It will be noticed, also, that the woman on the left is using for her splints a gauge set with metal blades. Indeed, the broad strips lying on the ground were worked out by machinery. Checkerwork and wickerwork are the only forms of technic practiced by these Chippewas. It will not be assumed by anyone that the improvement in environment has re dounded to the benefit of the savage art. The baskets are the common frame ware, and often the best of them bear no comparison in refinement with the work of their most savage sisters on the west coast. Photographed by Harlan I. Smith.
The acme of the northern Algonkin weaving is in twilled matting. The operation, technically, is Just on the border between free-hand plaiting and loom work. Plate 122 isa mat plaited by a Chippewa squaw, about 50 years old, at Grand Marais, Minnesota. It is of cedar bast made in strips a quarter of an inch wide, and is in three colors— one the natural tinge of the material and the other two dyed. The interesting features are, first, that the weaving is done from below upward, as in the Haida basketry and in the work carried on by Virginia Indians in the days of John Smith.
A small rod or stiff cord of bark is suspended by means of eight loops from a pole resting on two forked sticks. This is to give free motion to the woman’s hands. Over this the warp strings are suspended freely. The Chilkat blanket weaver, also, as will be seen, has no other machinery. For a few rows the weaving is simple checkerwork of the plainest kind, and then begins a series of twilled patterns over two and under two. But even this simplest technic so lends

itself to charming effects of light and shade that there is not a monotonous square inch on the surface. Another band of plain weaving is followed by zigzag and angular work, inclosing lines and squares, giving birth toa very pleasing effect. Some of the oldest pictures preserved in the early chronicles of the Algonkin Indians, to whom the Chippewa belong, show them weaving in exactly the same fashion.
The mat described above was made for Capt. R. D. Gaillard, U.S. A., in a single day, the work beginning at 9 o’clock in the morning and the finished product being delivered 2 miles away at + o'clock in the afternoon. It is 6 feet 5 inches long and 4 feet 5 inches wide.
The Menomini Indians of the Algonquian family, living in northern Wisconsin, are quite expert in various forms of basket work and hand weaving. Mats are woven from the leaves of rushes, flags or cattails, and cedar bark. They are for roofing temporary structures, such as medicine lodges, for partitions, floor mats and wrappings, and for various purposes in the canoes. The leaves and stems are strung

together by means of threads made of basswood fiber. In this they imitate a kind of textile well distributed throughout North America formerly.
The mats shown on Plates 21, 22, and 23 of Dr. Walter J. Hoffmann’s paper” on this tribe are made from the inner bark of the cedar, cut in strips averaging one-half inch in width, in mixed, twilled, and checker weaving, which, combined with the native color of the material and dyed strips, produce the greatest variety of diaper patterns. They do not differ essentially from Captain Gaillard’s mat just described.
The baskets of the Menominees resemble those of the eastern Canadian Indians. A log of elm wood is beaten until the space between the annual layers of growth is destroyed; the thin strips are then pulled off, cut to a uniform width, and scraped as smooth as possible. At present gauges of steel are used for the purpose. The weaving is done in checker, twilled, and wicker work. A section of the beaten log, showing the annual layers loosened, the mallet of wood, and the modern knife, resembling the ** man’s knife” throughout all the north-
ern tribes, are shown in figs. 110 to 114. For the finer kinds of bag-

ging the inner bark of the young sprouts of basswood is employed. It is removed in sheets and boiled in water with a quantity of lye. This softens the fiber and prepares for the next process, which consists in pulling bunches of the boiled bark forward and backward
through a hole in the shoulder blade of the deer. The fiber is twisted into yarn and made into cord or twine by winding on the thigh with the palm of the hand. This advance in the preparation of the textile elements

in a Mackenzie River snowshoe in which the vertical elements answering to warps are crossed and not interlaced, and the fabric is bound together by the weaving inand out of a single rawhide thong. Fig. 2, on the same plate, illustrates the next step in this weaving, and is suggestive of a feature in the twilled basketry taken from graves in a cemetery at Ancon, Peru, namely, the method by which a bar of the snowshoe frame enters into the weaving and widens the meshes.

In fig. 3, same plate, the warps at certain points in the manipulation are twisted in pairs about each other, : technical process in vogue throughout middle America, beginning as far north as the Mohave country in southern Arizona. It might be called the first step in lace making. Fig. 4, same plate, introduces another element of complexity wherein the warp elements instead of being twisted around each other are wrapped once or twice about the weft, so that the primitive lace work is effected both vertically and horizontally.

whites, and mentions very old specimens now in the possession of that museum, and others have been seen in private collections. The foundation coils are of sweet grass and about one-quarter of an inch in diameter. In some very old specimens the sewing is done with looped stitches, being continuous from the edge toward the center of the basket and not following the coils, as is usual. He also finds the following references to old basket work of the New Eneland Indians. (See Plate 124.) Gookin is quoted, writing in 1674, with the following words:
Several sorts of baskets, great and small, some of them hold 4 bushels or more, and so on downward to a pint. * * * Some of these baskets are made of rushes and some of bents (coarse grass), others of maize husks, others of a kind of silk grass, others of a kind of wild hemp, and some of bark of trees. Many of these are very neat and artificial, with the portraitures of birds, beasts, fishes, and flowers upon them in colors.
The soldiers under Captain Underhill, after destroying the Pequot fort in Connecticut in 1637, brought back with them ‘* several delightful baskets.” Brereton (1602) found baskets of twigs ‘‘ not unlike our oster.”” Champlain saw corn stored in ** great grass sacks.” — Josselyn

writes, ‘‘ Baskets, bags, and mats, woven with bark of the lime tree and rushes of several kinds, dyed as before, some black, blue, red, yellow.” In 1620 the Pilgrims found on a cache at Cape Cod ‘‘a great new basket, round and narrow at the top and containing 3 or 4 bushels of shelled corn, with 36 goodly ears unshelled.” The New England Indians were probably not less expert basket makers than other tribes to the west and south. Does not the fact that the three distinct forms of weavine—twined, checker, and coiled—still found among the Ojibwas seem to indicate a survival of these types from prehistoric times all over the great Algonkin area? A few years back this type of coiled work was more in vogue than at present. The next specimen described will take the reader a long way from the Great Lakes. (C. C. Willoughby.)
Plate 125 shows the detail of a flat coiled basket of the Eskimo about Cumberland Inlet, eastern Canada. The foundation likewise contains a bundle of straws, but badly put together and sewed with sinew thread, the stitches being wide apart and caught beneath a few straws of the preceding coil. The bottom is flat and the walls drawn in so as

<<<Page: 409>>>

to give a compressed shape. This interesting specimen has been many years in the National Museum and is credited to Capt. C. F. Hall, the Arctic explorer. It may be compared with others of the same type from the southern Canadian border. Catalogue No. 10203; height, 14 inches. A much later specimen also from the Eskimo is shown in the next plate.
Plate 126 is openwork coiled basketry of the Eskimo of Davis Inlet, astern Canada. The foundation is of straw and the sewing is done in the same material, the stitches merely interlocking. The noteworthy characteristic of the basket is the shght amount of sewing in certain portions. The bottom is not unlike the work of the western Eskimo, and, indeed, is a typical illustration. There is a little splitting of stitches, but probably not designed. On the sides the openwork is produced by wrapping the foundation with the straw for one-half an inch and then sewing, as in ordinary coiled work, the angles to the coil below. This may be compared in the wrapping with the openwork coiled basketry of the Kern County Indians in California. (See fig. 196.) Sewing of exactly the same style is to be found in northern Europe, and the the suggestion is made that this particular hein tm method among the eastern Eskimo is an

Plate 127 gives the profile and inside view of a shallow coiled basket tray of the Comanche Indians, living on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains, used princ ipully in gambling. The foundation is of rods and splints, the sewing with leaf of yucea (2 weca arkansana). Especial attention is invited to the fureate stitches, designedly and symmetrically split. This technic relegates the basket to the Ute or Shoshonean area, west of the Rockies. The Comanches belong to the Shoshonean family. Its diameter is 9 inches.
In the National Museum are four small, dish-shaped, coiled gambling baskets, Catalogue Nos. 6342, 8427, and 153932, gathered from the Rees or Caddoan Indians, the other one from the Mandans, who are Siouan. These baskets are made from willow, on a two-rod foundation, but roughly assembled and sewed with splints of the same material. The

<<<Page: 410>>>

borders are all well done in false braid. No more interesting specimens are to be found in this collection.
There are four other gambling baskets of the same type, but of different material, and are fairly made. The foundation is a single stem of, perhaps, willow, the sewing in the leaves of yucea (2 wecu arkansana). Catalogue Nos. 152802, 152803, 165246, and 165765, and gathered from the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowan Indians in Indian Territory.
Finally, modern pedagogy has found in the long leaves of the Georgia pine a material by means of which poor people may weave a little of the sense of beauty into their lives.
Plate 128 is a covered basket, made near Augusta, Georgia, from the leaves of the pine by a native Georgia woman, under the instruction and patronage of Mrs. Perey H. Babcock, of Hudson, Ohio. The sewing material is tough, brown linen thread. The interesting characteristic in this specimen is the undesigned resemblance between the stitching and that on the Hudson Bay Eskimo specimen, as well as the old Chippewa specimen in the Peabody Museuim, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Coiled work, as was shown in the chapter on weaving, changes to lace work by omitting the hard foundation. In this Eastern Area two witnesses, far apart in time, are here to testify to the widespread ancientness of a coiled work now universal in tropical America.
Figs. a and 4, Plate 129, represent the method of weaving in the game bags, or muskemoots, of the Dog Rib and other Athapascan Indians in northwestern Canada for domestic purposes. ‘These tribes and their relatives in central Alaska use the bireh-bark vessels for all sorts of domestic purposes. For transportation they do not make regular baskets, but buckskin wallets, in which a process of coiled weaving now to be described is employed. The sides and borders of the game bags are of dressed skin of moose and reindeer. For the body of the bag the same material is cut into fine string and rolled. This material is called ** babiche.” It is quite evident that before the introduction of the steel knife this material was much coarser, as may be known not only from the game bags, but also from the snowshoes. sy examining fig. /a small section from one of the muskemoots will show how the work is done. The border of the bag on its lower edge is pierced at equal distances for the reception of the first row of weaving. Through these holes the babiche is strung by half hitches, or what is called ‘* buttonhole stitch.” The work proceeds in the same manner round and round until it is desirable to make a variation in the technical process. In the middle of the drawing it will be seen how this is done. The end of the babiche is carried through a stitch in the row above and twisted one and a half times about itself. As many turns as is desirable can be made, and thus the ornamentation may be

varied. This method of coiled work, the first described in the table of methods (page 248), does not occur again among the Indians until the borders of Mexico are reached, where the tribes in their carrying nets, and farther south in their w allets and hammoe ‘ks, employ precisely the same method of workmanship. This specimen, Catalogue No. 2028, with several others in the U. 8S. National Museum from the Dog Rib Indians of northwestern Canada, was collected by Bernard R. Ross. Warren K. Moorehead found examples of the muskemoot weaving in the Hopewell mounds, Ohio. There was nothing but an easy portage here and there to hinder passage by water from the mouth of the Mackenzie to the neighborhood of the Hopewell mounds. Examples in Peabody Museum, Massachusetts, and in the Field Columbian, Chicago, prove the identity of technic. (See figs. 115 and 116.)

There is a general ae that the baskets of the ordinary soft character described were used by these eastern peoples in the manufacture of pottery and were ruthlessly destroyed in the burning, but Holmes’s investigations tend to show that pliable materials had been almost exclusively employed. In the Pueblo region the case was quite different, though there is no evidence of the burning of the basket.
The twined wallets or other fabrics used were removed before the vessel was burned or even dried. In many cases handles and ornaments were added after these impressions were made, also incised designs were executed in the soft clay after the removal of the textile.
It is quite evident that textile impressions were used to enhance the beauty of the vessel, not to support the clay in process of construction.
In many examples, notably the salt vessels of Saline River, Illinois, the fabric was applied after the vessel was finished, inasmuch as the loose threads sag or festoon toward the rim. Simple cord markings arranged to form patterns have been employed on many examples. And in those cases where basketry textile was pressed on the surface

<<<Page: 412>>>

it was not the common, careless weaving, but the elegant designs, as will be seen in the plates.
The textile markings on pottery, ancient and modern, are of five classes:
1. Impressions on the surface, made by rigid basketry, used in molding and modeling.
2. Impressions of pliable fabrics on the soft clay.
3. Impressions of woven textures used over the hand or on a modeling or malleating implement.
4. Impressions of cords wrapped about modeling or malleating paddles or rocking tools.
5. Impressions of bits of cords or other textile units, singly or in groups, applied for ornament only, and so arranged as to give textilelike patterns.

If the reader will turn to the classification of basket-making methods (p. 190), it will be noticed that many of these are to be found in the ancient basket ware impressed on pottery by the eastern Indians. Referring to Professor Holmes’s paper, openwork checker weaving is very rare among impressions on clay. Foster illustrates one example on pottery from a mound on Great Miami River, Butler County, Ohio. Checkerwork of the close type, on the other hand, was practiced in nearly all the Atlantic States, upon the testimony of pottery fragments.
From potsherds found in the State of New York, closely packed checkerwork patterns have been copied. Charred fabrics from mounds in Ohio reveal the coarsest kinds of oblique checker weaving. Holmes illustrates an example in which the oblique work imitates mat plaiting without a frame, worked from a corner. The selvage and the weft cross the texture obliquely.’

Not only checkerwork, but twilled work in cane and in twine and wickerwork in soft material have been brought to light by cave explorations in the Western and Southern States. In the Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology Holmes figures an example of wickerwork in soft materials froma cave in Kentucky. (See figs. 117, 118, and 119.) ¢
To show the distribution of this ancient style of weaving, reference is here made to—
1. Coarse oblique checker twilled work from Ohio, made of twine.
2. In the same volume (fig. 12) is shown a fragment of twilled cane matting from Petite Anse Island, Louisiana. It has been preserved all these years by salt. (See fig. 126.)

3. Plate 2 in Holmes’s report shows a mat of split cane from a rock shelter on Cliff Creek, Morgan County, Tennessee. It is 6 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 4 inches. The variety of twilled effects and the patterned border leave nothing to be desired.
4. Ina mound near Augusta, Georgia, a fragment of twilled matting was found attached to the surface of a bit of copper, Holmes’s fig. 11. The interesting feature of this example is that on the side shown the warp passes over one and under four, the weft, over four and under one. His fig. 15, from Alabama, is similar, only the formula is three and one.
5. Fig. 14 is from an impression of twilled weaving on a fragment of pottery found in Polk County, Tennessee. Three characteristics of this fragment claim attention. The warp is of fine twine, the weft of

coarse yarn; the work is over two, both in warp and weft; the weaving is oblique. The effect of this technic is pleasing and unique, the components being bands of close work alternating with bands of openwork, made up of sloping elements giving great varicty to unity. It will be seen that the checker and the twilled work in ancient eastern North America had about the same distribution as now. Twined weaving was common throughout the Middle and Kastern States of the Union in prehistoric times. Fabrics of this class were employed by the ancient potters in nearly all of the States. Every variety of twined weaving known to the modern Indian was practiced

Holmes figures examples from pottery in Tennessee, Georgia, Arkansas, Ilinois, Missouri, and Iowa. Even the intricate and delicate fens of twined weaving described on page 234 as zig-zag or divided warp and crossed warp were well known. The ancient pottery of the Mississippi Valley furnishes many examples of this, as will be seen in Holmes’s papers.” Traces of wattled work are found in the mounds of the Lower Mis-

sissippi Valley, where imprints of the interlaced canes occur in the baked clay plaster with which the dwellings were finished. In the same connection John Smith, Butel-Dumont, Du Pratz, Lafitau, and John Lawson are quoted on the use of wattling for houses, inclosure, biers, and burial platforms. A fish trap with long wings done in twined wattling is figured in Hariot and here reproduced from Holmes. (See fig. 120.)
The illustration shows a warp of stakes driven into the bottom of the stream close enough together to let the small fry pass through and to offer no impediment to the flow of water. Brush or poles constitute the warp. The rivers of the Atlantic coast teemed with shad, herring, rockfish, sturgeon, and more, in the spring, and it is permitted to infer that twined fish traps were universal there.
Plate 130, thanks to the preserving care of potsherds, introduces the reader to the old basket makers of no one knows how many centuries ago. From three fragments, selected out of myriads and shown in the plate on the right hand, the casts on the left being in plaster, one might think himself studying specimens from the Aleutian Islands or the Great Interior Basin. The figure at the bottom is in plain openwork of twined weaving, the material being a soft bast, perhaps of native hemp. Hundreds of wallets indistinguishable in texture from this are now brought from around Bristol Bay, Alaska. The figure in the middle is openwork twined weaving in diagonal pattern. The warp strands are in pairs and flexible, making the interstices triangular and giving to the weaving the appearance of ‘‘fagoting.” If the weft were forced close together, the texture would be the common twilled work of the Pacific slope. The upper figures are also twined, but of rarer style, the warp being set diagonally. This figure is worthy of note in two respects. The workmanship in twisting of the threads is superb. One would have to look a long time through a collection of twined weaving of the present day to see threads near so fine. Not until the outermost island of the Aleutian chain was reached would the specimen appear. The other characteristic is the sloping warp, a thing of rare occurrence in twined weaving.
A further glance at basketry technic preserved in impressions on pottery and in caves shows plain twined weave, open or closed, with vertical or oblique warp; twilled weaving in twined weft and twined weaving with zigzag warp; three-ply twined weaving, and a style of twined work, which for exhausting possibilities of variety in warp treatment will vie with any modern example. The material is good twine, the warp is administered in groups of sixes, oblique toward the right. The weft is a two-ply twine which in crossing the warp takes in a strand at each half turn and is twisted tightly in the open spaces. The pattern is varied by bands of close weft in three rows, above and below which the groups of six warp strands are split into threes.

these wallets is so interesting in the survival of ancient weaves that they justify a special description. The weft is plain twined weaving; all the ornamentation, therefore, is effected by means of the warp, which is partly vertical, but more of the zigzag type seen in many Aleutian Island wallets. In all of the specimens examined the warp is made up of twine, partly in the material of the weft and partly in colored yarns. The diameter of the warp twine, especially the yarns, seems to be greater than the length of the twists in the weft, so that there is a crowding which brings one color to the front and leaves another color inside—that is, the figures that are brown on the outside will
appear in yarn on the inside and
eee the reverse. To be more explicit, Ea ae asp cap a beginning at the lower edge of any one of these wallets the warp may be in pairs, the elements of which separate and come together alternately in the rows of weaving. On the outside of the bag two elm-bark warp strands will be included and appear; in the next half twine two yarns will be included and show on the inside of the wallet. After this zigzag process goes on

for a short distance the weaver changes her plan, omits the bark or the yarn warp altogether, but continues the twining process, catching the warp in every other half turn of the twine. Again, there will be a row or two of ordinary twined weaving with straight warp, when she returns to her zigzag method, covering the entire surface therewith. At the top of the bag an inch or less of plain twined weaving in which the warps are vertical and included in pairs brings her to the outer border, where all the warps are twisted together and turned back to be fastened off in the texture. In an old example in the National Museum long, cut fringes are sewed to the upper margin and to the sides of the bug.
The photographs of the twined bag shown in Plate 131 were taken by William Orchard, of the American Museum of Natural History, and presented to the National Museum by Harlan I. Smith. On one side amguntain lion and the other an eagle with geometric figures are shown in black. The technic of this particular example from left to right would be five vertical rows of plain twined weaving; nine rows of mixed warp, but plain weaving; a course of braided warp in which the four elements of two rows of warp are braided together and included in the twine. On the other side is a similar administration. The middle portion shows zigzag twined weaving, figured. Above this is a row of three-ply twined weaving, as among many of the Western tribes; above this three rows of plain twined weaving in openwork including all the warps. At the top the
yarps are twisted and fastened into the texture. It must be clearly understood that the figures which show black on the outside—that is, the eagle and the Hon—will be white on the inside, necessarily. The colors used in the small specimen of the National Museum are the natural color of the bark mixed with brown, black, and blue yarns. The National Museum is indebted to Andrew John, a Seneca Indian of New York, for a number of specimens of modern Iroquoian twined
yare from corn husks.
There was a decided lack of coiled basketry in all this vast region. Every kind of hand-woven ware was known. Algonquian, Iroquoian, Siouan, and Muskhogean tribes of the present, and all the cave-dwelling, mound-building, ancients, seem, so far as the evidence points, to have known little of coiling.
From this hasty survey of ancient hand weaving in basketry and the other receptacles, as well as in matting, webbing, sandals, and such products of the textile art as resemble basketry, it is now allowed to examine their modern representatives in the southern portions of the same area.
In the States of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana are many Indians still living, remnants of the Cherokees (Iroquoian); Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws, and Seminoles (Muskhogean), and the almost vanished Attakapas and

<<<Page: 418>>>

Chetimachas. Some of them were removed fifty years ago into the Indian Territory. Through the lowlands of these States grow the interminable cane brakes, and from the split cane all these tribes make their basketry. They follow the twilled pattern of weaving. Even now there may be purchased in Mobile, New Orleans, and other Southern cities little baskets of yellow, red, black, and green cane woven in twill, crossing with the woof two
or more warp splints, and managing the checks so as to produce diamonds and various zigzag patterns on the outside. The Choctaws make a basket oval at the top and pointed below for presents, averring that this shape imitated the heart, which always accompanies every gift. The handles of their basketry are very clumsily put on, marring greatly the appearance of the otherwise attractive object. Often in weaving two thin strips are laid together, the soft sides inward. The evident motive in doubling the thin strips

is to have both sides of the bas-
ket or mat glossy and smooth. Further on it will be noted that in twined weaving, where the strands of the weft are from split roots, both sides are rendered smooth by revolving each strand half a turn as it passes through between the warp stems. (See p. 406.)

bent down and inclosed in a wrapping of the same material. Underneath this is a row of twined weaving, which holds in place those warp clements that do not enter into the texture. A much neater example of work of this kind is shown in the next figure, where the filaments are more carefully prepared and manipulated and the border more neatly finished, but the technical process is the same. The artistic effect of plain twilled work is shown in this example.
Fig. 124 exhibits the process of crossing in what might be called diaper or figured work. The effect is heightened by dyeing black one set of the filaments, either warp or weft. In that case the figures stand out most prominently. The entire effect of this sort of weaying, however, is in the endless combination of rectangles, black and white, all having the same width and different lengths.

Plates 132-133 represent the twilled basketry of the Chetimacha Indians, Chetimachan family, who have their home on Grande River and the larger part in Charenton, St. Marys Parish. The name is derived from the Choctaw words tehuti, ** cooking vessels,” masha, **they possess.” Mr. Gatschet in 1881 found about fifty individuals still living. The material of their work is the cane (Arundinaria tecta) and all of their weaving is in the twilled style of technic.
Compared with the work of the Choctaws (Plate 134) and their neighbors, the Attakapa (Plate 135), it is more picturesque and attractive, the colors being the original of the cane, red and yellow. Similar work is to be seen in the northern part of South America, especially in Guiana. The interesting feature of the Attakapa weaving is that frequently the specimens have the appearance of being double—that is, both the outside and the inside of the receptacle presenting the small surface of the cane. At once the work connects itself with matting found in the caves of Kentucky and Tennessee.
Plate 133 represents a fine collection of old Chetimachas in the collection of Mrs. Sidney Bradford, of Avery Parish, Louisiana. They should be examined carefully, since they were posed so as to exhibit the technic of the various parts.
Plate 135 shows a small number of twilled basketry made by the Attakapa Indians living in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. They are the last remnant of an independent linguistic family once spread southward along the Texan coast. The baskets are made from the stems of the cane. The outer tough layer is split off and dyed if necessary. It is then worked into twilled ware, which by the texture and variety of colors shows elegant designs.
These specimens, Catalogue Nos. 165735 to 165739 in the U. S. National Museum, were collected in Louisiana by Mrs. William Preston Johnston.

The Cherokee make the handsomest clothes baskets, considering their materials. They divide large swamp canes into long, thin, narrow splinters, which they dye for several colors, and manage the workmanship so well that both the inside and outside are covered with a beautiful variety of pleasing figures; and though for the space of 2 inches below the upper edge of each basket it is worked into one, through the other parts they are worked asunder, as if they were two joined atop by some strong cement. A large nest consists of eight or ten baskets contained one within another. Their dimensions are different, but they usually make the outside basket about a foot deep, a foot and a half broad, and almost a yard long.“
A type collection of this ware was made for the National Museum by James Mooney.’
Fig. 125 shows one of the oldest and most beautiful baskets in the National Museum, presented by Drs. Gray and Matthews, of the Army. Four bent poles constitute the framework. Those at the sides are 10 inches apart at the top, + at the bottom, and are quite concealed in the structure. The end pair cross these at right angles and descend 6 inches to afford a rest for the load. The varrying strap is of rawhide. The weaving is in twilled work, with diaper patterns made in narrow strips of bark, some having their outer, some their inner Fic. 125.

The weaving was done by an Arikara woman in Dakota. Now, these Indians are not Sioux, but belong to the Caddoan family spread over Louisiana and Texas. It should not be surprising, therefore, to find baskets similar to those of the Cherokees and the Gulf tribes in their hands.

and the weft, are entirely different material, one a finely spun thread, the other a loose, coarse filament several times wider than the former, and are woven together in the ordinary plan of under two and over two, and yet the difference in the width and tension of the two elements produces a most charming effect which is not lost, after many thousands of years, in the cast taken from the surface of the fragment. (Seep. 225.) An example of matting, also illustrated by Holmes, was taken from a piece of pottery found in Alabama. It is worked in the diagonal style, but on one side the warp passes over one and under three, and, consequently, though the matting was destroyed hundreds of years ago it is certain that on the other side of the fabric the weft made a similar figure, but vertical.

and round. (See p. 241.) Only one family of Indians on the whole Western Hemisphere at present employ this technic, the Yuman, of Arizona. (Fig. 13; compare fig. 14 in the chapter on processes. )
It is an interesting fact that the Andamanese, living halfway round the world, employ the same method of workmanship on their open fish baskets.
Fig. 126 is from the photograph of a specimen of ancient twilled matting from Petit Anse Island, near Vermilion Bay, coast of Louisiana, presented to the Smithsonian Institution by J. F. Cleu, in May, 1866. Petit Anse Island is the locality of the remarkable mine of rock salt, exploited during the civil war, and from which, for a considerable time, the Southern States derived a great part of their supply of this article. The salt is almost chemically pure and apparently inexhaustible in quantity, occurring in every part of the island, which is about 5,000 acres in extent, at a depth below the surface of the soil of 15 or 20 feet. The fragment of matting here photographed was found near the surface of the salt. No vast antiquity can be argued on this account, but the specimen is without doubt very old and a relic of the weavers who lived a long time before the discovery of America. The material consists of the outer bark of the common Southern cane (Arundinaria tecta) and has been preserved for so long a period both by its siliceous character and the strongly saline condition of the soil.
There is a charm in the name of such Indian materials as spruce root, wild rye,
and cedar bark, but they would be useless to us without the Indian touch. —Mary Wuite.
For convenience of study a line may be drawn across the map of North America from Dixon Entrance northeastward so as to have Queen Charlotte Islands and the makers of coiled basketry that are inland to the north of it. The tribes included will be Athapascan, Eskimauan, Koluschan, and Skittagetan. Among the two first named twined and coiled work in many styles of weaving will be found, while the two last named and their northern neighbors, the Aleuts, have avoided coiled basketry altogether. In Plate 136 are gathered types of the peninsula of Alaska, Athapascan, Eskimo, and Aleutian, embracing hard coil, soft coil, closed twined work, open twined work, straight warp, crossed warp, and hemstitch, gathered by E. W. Nelson.
In studying the basketry of this area the following division, according to tribes atid families, will be found convenient:
1. Athapascan (interior of Alaska).
2. Eskimo (around shore).
3. Aleuts (Aleutian Archipelago).
4. Tlinkits (southeastern Alaska).
5. Haidas (Queen Charlotte Archipelago).

Perhaps no other family of American tribes has such a variety of contacts with neighbors of different linguistic families and of limitations in environments having little likeness to one another. This northern branch of them, as will be seen in Father Morice’s list,“ is in touch along their southern border with Algonquian descendants of Mound Builders on the Ohio, with birch-bark workers in northern middle Canada, and with Pacific coast tribes here and there. Some of these were noted in speaking of Region 1, page 379, with illustrations. Further on other contacts will be shown. The distribution of the family is given by Powell on his linguistic map of North America.’
Here the Athapascans are in touch with Eskimo; indeed, most of the specimens of their ware shown were procured from the latter in trade. Their technical methods will be best understood through illustrations.

Splints of willow and spruce root are employed in the work and the ornamentation is meager, consisting of stripes on the side, and borders in quilled work dyed in different colors. These specimens vary from 6 to 8 inches in diameter, and were gathered by R. MacFarlane, B. R. Ross and W. L. Hardesty. Fig. 127 is a coiled basket jar of the Tinné Indians near Point Barrow, Alaska. The specimen belongs to the single-rod type, in which one rod or stem constitutes the foundation.

It is said to have come from Sidaru. The owner declared that it came from the Great River in the South, which Mr. Murdoch interprets to mean the Kowak, flowing into Hotham Inlet. The Eskimo are in the habit of going to this place in order to trade with the Indians, and thus this coiled basket found its way into the possession of the Eskimo at Point Barrow.

Baskets not only have an infinite variety of uses from village to village, but among each people they have a multitude of uses. From the shore of Norton Sound to the Kuskokwim the women are expert in Weaving grass mats, baskets, and bags. Grass mats are used on the sleeping benches and for wrapping around bedding. They are used also as sails for umiaks. They now frequently serve as curtains to partition off the corners of a room or sleeping platform. Small mats are placed also in the manholes of kaiaks as cushions. The bags are used for storing fish, berries, and other food supplies, or for clothing. Smaller bags and baskets are made for containing small articles used in the house.’
Two types of basket work are found in close proximity among the Eskimo in the neighborhood of Norton Sound and Bristol Bay, north
and south, the twined and the coiled. In the former (fig. 133) the

treatment is precisely the same as in those of Aleutian Islands to be described, but the Eskimo wallet is of coarser material and the weaying is far more rudely done. Quite as interesting as the wallets is the matting. (See Plate 136.)
At Chuwuk, on the Lower Yukon, Nelson saw a woman making one of these mats and watched the process she employed. <A set of three or four straws was twisted and the ends turned in, forming a strand, a number of which were arranged side by side with their ends fastened along a stick, the primeval loom, forming one end of the mat and hanging down for the warp. Other strands were then used as woof. By a deft twist of the fingers it was carried from one side to the other, passing above and below the strands of the warp; then the woof strand was passed around the outer strand of the warp and twined to repeat the operation. The strands were made continuous by adding straws as necessary, and with each motion the strands were twisted a little so as to keep them firmly together. By this simple method a variety of patterns are produced.
Grass bags are started from the bottom where the strands of the warp, consisting of two or more grass stems, are fastened together and extend vertically downward. The woof is formed by a double strand of grass, each of which is twisted about itself and both twined with the strands of the warp inclosed in the turns; both are continually twisted as the weaving progresses. In coarsely made bags the strands of the woof are spaced from an inch to two inches apart, and those of the warp at intervals of from a quarter to half an inch. These bags have a conical bottom, which slopes from.the center to the sides. At the mouth the ends of the warp are braided to form a continuous edge.@
The lower figures in Nelson’s group of Alaskan basketry (Plate 136) show plainly the matting, the closely woven twined wallet, and the openwork. Plates 137 to 145 in this paper are all excellent illustrations of the ware here described. The specimens are in the U.S. National Museum.
Plate 137 will show better the detail, body and bottom, of one of the twined wallets of the Norton Sound Eskimo. The warp and the twining of the bottom are of a very coarse, rush-like grass. The bottom is in openwork and oval. In this example the warp is radiating froma median line; in others the strands are laid parallel, so that they formarectangle. At the boundary line between the bottom and the body of the wallet there is a row of three-strand weaving, the rows running in opposite directions, as will be seen in the drawing. The body is of rush color; the spotted lines on the cylindrical portion are in black, produced by the insertion of rags and bits of hide. This
« Kighteenth Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, 1900, pl. Lxxrv.

<<<Page: 428>>>

effect may be varied by mixing two strands of different color in the twine. The fastening off at the top is done by working the warp strands into a three-strand braid, turning down on the inside of the vessel, and cutting off an end whenever a new warp thread is taken up by the braid. Frequently the last three or four warp straws are not cut off, but braided out to their extremities in order to form a bandle for the basket.
In order to show how the warp and weft are administered in this far north region, a square inch of a wallet is represented much enlarged, fig. 133. The openwork producing parallel figures is effected by leaving spaces between the different lines of twining. The four rows at the top of the drawing are plain, solid, twined weaying; the fifth row from the top is twined in an opposite direction, giying the effect of a three-strand braid between the two rows; the third row from the top represents imperfectly the effect produced by the three-strand work. It is interesting to find this method of basket weaying so far north.
The student will notice farther on that very much of the elegant use of the warp in ornamentation, so common with the Aleuts, who speak a kindred language and live near by, is lost. It will be seen, however, that with their rude materials and tools the Eskimo have still acquired the art of making a WIG. 133. great variety of basketry, showing DETAIL OF ESKIMO TWINED WALLET. that they have had a multitude of teachers. This specimen, Catalogue No. 38872 in the U. 8S. National Museum, was collected, with many others, at Norton Sound, by E. W. Nelson.
To furnish a means of comparison between the two sides of Bering Sea, Plate 138 is a twined wallet of the Chukchi people of Kamchatka. The foundation is of straw laid parallel, and the weft is of plain twined weaving, the rows one-half an inch apart. The border is finished off by gathering the ends of the warp into a braid. The decoration on this basket is effected first by coloring warp strands black and grouping them systematically, and also by three narrow bands of black twined weaving near the top. Its height is 12 inches. This specimen, now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was collected by the Jessup Expedition.

The bottom is ornamented with bands in two colors; in each band there are alternate rows of black and white stitches arranged perpendicularly; in the next band they are oblique, and in the next perpendicular, forming a interminable mass of changing patterns, having a very pleasing effect. The body is covered with alternations of plain and variegated bands in which the white and black are administered in triangles, rectangles, chevrons, and zigzag patterns. The work on this wallet is finely done. The effect of the ornamentation is

The work nearest like this will be found quite common on the eastern side of Bering Sea and on the Pacific coast of America. The writer is indebted to Dr. Franz Boas for drawing attention to these similarities.
Its height is 13 inches. This specimen, now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was collected by the Jessup Expedition.
The coiled variety of Eskimo basketry, previously mentioned, consists of a bunch of grass sewed in a continuous coil by a whip stitch

over the bunch and under a few stems in the coil just beneath, the stitch looping under a stitch of the lower coil. When this kind of work is carefully done, as among the Indians of New Mexico, Arizona, and California, and in some exquisite examples in bamboo from Siam and in palm leaf from Nubia, beautiful results are reached; but the Eskimo basket maker does not prepare her foundations evenly, sews carelessly, passing the thread sometimes through the stitches just below and sometimes between them, and does not work her stitches home (fig. 51). It can not be said that she has no skill with the needle, for her embroideries in fur, intestines, and quill are excellent.

deer hair taken from between the hoofs are modernly used in ornamentation, just av the California women catch the stems of feathers under their stitches as they sew.
Figs. 135 and 136 will illustrate this rude type of coiled basket ofthe Eskimo about Norton Sound. It is quite certain that the art of basket making is not an old one with these people. They have not learned how to begin the work from the center of the foundation, and always leave a circular space, either vacant or to be filled with some other substance. In the example here shown a piece of hide 4 inches in diameter and irregular in outline constitutes the starting point. Holes are punched around the edge of this, as shown in the detail drawing (fig. 135), and the foundation of grass stems and leaves is sewed immediately to this with strips of the same material, not with any regularity or neatness. The basket has a cover, which is also interesting in its leather hinges, fastening, and handle. It must be admitted, however, under the aheniee and demands of trade, that the
art is improving. Specimens are at this eT date brought home that are vastly better
Wi i tu made than any of the old pieces in the

The foundation of the coil is a small number of slender grass stems. The sewing is in material of the same kind. The special characteristic of this specimen is that, in the sewing, the grass filament is wrapped once around the foundation and on the next turn is locked in the stitch underneath. This is an economical method of working, but it weakens the basket. The work on this specimen is slovenly done. Tt has a small piece of leather in the center of the foundation. Height,

The coiled work on this specimen is unique. A grass foundation is held together by half hitches or buttonhole stitches in the same close together. There are 16 rows. The stitches pass over the foundation, lock with the stitches underneath, and in returning make a turn about the standing part. The technic is not half hitch, but, if the foundation were pulled out, would resembie the twisted coils in the Mackenzie River game bags, muskemoots (Plate 129), or the work on the textile from Hopewell mound, Ohio.

The stitches pass over both strips of the foundation and are caught between the two strips of the foundation coil underneath. This is the only specimen of its kind in the Museum from Alaska. The use of a broad foundation gives a flat appearance to the surface, something like that of the Mescalero basketry in Arizona. A handle is attached, the technic being the same as that of the basket. It is probably of Indian manufacture. Its height is about 42 inches, and it was collected by J. Henry Turner.

Around this sealskin the bottom consists of a continuous coil of grass stems held together by a wide, open coiled sewing in sinew thread. The body is built up ona grass foundation with sewing in the same material, resembling precisely the work done by the Eskimo of Port Clarence. Three rows of coiled work at the top are like that at the bottom, and over all is a band of sealskin rawhide with holes here and there for carrying. Its height is 9 inches. This specimen, now in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, was collected by the Jessup expedition.
The bottom figure on Plate 140 is a braided and coiled wallet of the Koryak people of Kamchatka. The foundation is a strip of sealskin. The body is built up in a continuous coil of six-strand braid, as in making hats. The decoration consists of alternating plain with colored rows of braid. Loops of sealskin on the top serve for fastening and carrying. This isa rare type of basketry in America. Its height is 13 inches.
There is a small specimen in the U. S. National Museum, obtained by Captain John Rodgers, U. S. Navy, in 1852-5, made in the same way. <As his expedition was on the Arctic coast of Asia, this piece also may have come home from that quarter.
Plate 141 is a covered coiled basket in the collection of F. Harvey. It is from the Lower Yukon River country and represents one of the best types of Eskimo work. Especial attention is called to the evenness of the stitches, which interlock and at intervals gather in a few of the straws of the foundation. The mottled surface of the basket should also be noted in connection with the delightful effects produced by simply managing the natural colors of the straw with which the sewing is done. Attention has been directed to the glorification of

this technical method by the Mission Indians in California. This specimen represents the very best coiled work that the Eskimo can make.
In 1874, William H. Dall contributed to the U.S. National Museum a number of specimens of twined basketry, from Attu and other islands far out in the Aleutian chain. (Catalogue Nos. 19476-19480). There for the first time this exquisite weaving was brought to light. Warp and weft are straws of beach grass“ and the workmanship will compare favorably with that of any other basket makers in the world. In the conical wallets, which resemble in outline those of the Eskimo and southeastern Alaskan tribes, the warp straws radiate from the center of the bottom. On the body the twined weft, always the same plain two-strand work, is applied to the warp so as to give rise to seyeral technical varieties, which may be classified as follows:
1. Plain twined weaving, the weft driven home (Plate 142).
2. Open twined work, there being open spaces between the rows of weaving, but the warp strands are parallel.
3. Crossed warp, in which there are two sets of warp elements, one half inclining to the right, the other half toward the left. The twined weaving binds the decussations, making hexagonal meshes. This type has an interesting distribution on both sides of the Pacific.
4. Divided warp. <A pretty effect is produced by these Aleut basket makers, who split the warp, or divide it, if it consists of straws in pairs, and twining the weft straws around two halves of the same straw and next around two half straws not of the same but of adjoining stalks. If the warp be of straws by twos, the left side member of one pair is entwined with the right-hand member of the adjoining pair. On the next round there is an alternation, the straws that belong together being entwined. The result of this is a series of lozenge-shaped openings or meshes (figs. 16, 17). The general eppearance of the surface resembles a form of needlework called hemstitching. The Aleuts in doubling the warp do not place one element behind another as do the Tlinkits, but alongside. This enables the weaver to convert her technic into some other type in the successive rounds. She may have plain twining, crossed warp, zigzag warp, or hemstitch at any moment.
5. Diverted warp. By this is meant a form of weaving in which certain warp straws are deflected from the perpendicular for a few courses and then brought back or changed to the upright position again. The result of this is a most pleasing effect (Plate 148) and of the greatest variety on the surface. Attention has been previously

invited to the similarity of mound builder’s work in the Mississippi Valley to the playing with the warp of which the Aleuts were so fond. Away down among the mummies of Peru are found relics of weaying of precisely the same sort.
Ornamentation is produced by what looks like darning or whipping one or more rows of colored grass after the body is formed. It is in effect the false embroidery of the Tlinkits farther south. The worsted patterns are woven into the texture and do not show at all on the inside. (See fig. 16.) Another plan of attaching the ornamentation is very ingenious, but not uncommon. Two strands of colored straw are twined, and at every half turn one of the strands is hooked under a twist on the body of the basket by a kind of ‘* aresene” work or false embroidery with twine. This ornament has a bold relief effect on the outside and is not seen at all on the inside.
The making of the beautiful twined ware is not new in these small islands. Lisiansky@ affirms that the Aleuts made baskets called ‘isheats,” in which they keep all their valuables.
To begin with the eastern tribes, Catalogue No. 2192, in the U.S. National Museum, is a twined wallet of the Aleuts (Eskimaun family) on Kadiak Island, Alaska. Native name, Enakhtak. It is made entirely of Topkhnaluk or wild rye (Z7ymus). The lower stalks are chosen because they become yellow through want of light. The wallets are woven from the standing grass, generally in July and August, by the women, while engaged in curing salmon. In order to secure uniformity in texture the broader leaves are split. An ordinary knife is used to cut the grass, but no other apparatus than nimble fingers has to do with the manufacture. The twining is called agankhak. The Kadiak baskets are used chiefly in gathering berries and also in straining a kind of wine made from them. This specimen was collected by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. 8. Navy.
These wallet baskets are woven without ornamentation, or may be a line or so near the mouth, often effected by introducing one or more rows of black rags, the warp strands forming a heavy plaited rope-like border, which permits carriage by means of cords through the openings. In the Kadiak wallets the Tlinkit border is also imitated where the warp ends are bent down and held by twined weaving.
Catalogue No. 14978 in the U. S. National Museum is a typical old Aleut wallet. The cylindrical part is covered with meshes in diamond pattern, shown in fig. 9, Plate 136. The ornamentation on the surface is produced by false embroidery with strands of red, blue, and black worsted. The continuous line between the open stripes is formed by false whipping with a single thread of worsted on the outer stitches of one of the twines of straw. The border is a complicated braid.

A square inch of this weave, enlarged (see fig. 17), taken from the part of the texture where the rectangular meshes or plain work pass into the lozenge-shaped meshes, will show the peculiar method of separating the warp threads and working the halves alternately to the right and to the left.“ In the bottom row the pairs of warp straws are perpendicular and gathered into the twined weaving so as to produce rectangular spaces. All the rows above this are in the pattern here described. From the Attu Island, collected by William H. Dall.
Plate 142 shows the fine close-twined work done on the extreme western islands of the Aleutian chain. The specimen here described is Catalogue No. 204588, U.S. National Museum, the gift of Mrs. Mary L. D. Putnam, of Davenport, Iowa. Its noteworthy features are the crossed warp and the patterns worked in colored worsted on the surface. The material is beach grass, some species of Elymus. The false embroidery on the surface, there can be no doubt, is borrowed in its method from the Tlinkit Indians of southeastern Alaska, Among the old Aleut wallets, of which there are many in the National Museum, the weaving does not begin to be so fine as on this later ware. It is the same story of progress. With the possession of better knowledge, of superior tools, of gauges for sizing the straws, and, above all, of such demands for their products as to stimulate emulation to its highest pitch, the Atka and Attu weavers have reached their climax.
Plate 1483 is introduced to show the technic of variety No. 5, diverted warp combined with variety No. 2, or open work. Fig. illustrates the general effect of this combination. Attention has been called before to the enigmas awakened by the great variety and exquisite taste of these people, our first possession in the Eastern Hemisphere. In figs. 6 and ¢ the detail will be better understood. In fig. 4 the first row has parallel warp. In the next row each pair of continuous warp straws are crossed. In the third row they proceed vertically, and so do most of them in the fourth row, but here and there they are crossed again back to the position they occupied in the second row. These, too, continue in the oblique direction in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rows, crossed in each with a straw of that particular row. In the upper course they return to the vertical position. The twined weaving is precisely the same in every case. It does not vary whether in the closed weaving or open weaving. No artistic effect is expected therefrom. In this plate, where the decorative form is started in the bottom row and begins to widen out all of the intersections within the parallelograms are crossed. At the tenth row, above the upper border of the drawing, the straws return to their vertical posimon immediately over Be starting point.

These two are only specimens of the innumerable ways of producing effects in Aleutian baskets by changes in the warp.
It will add to the interest in the Attu weaver to see her at her work. Plate 144, taken by Engineer C. Gadsden Porcher, of the United States Revenue Marine, shows her at the front door of her barabra or underground hut. She is essentially a cave dweller. The framework of the house may be driftwood, wreckage, or timber deposited by ships. Over this moss from the tundra is piled, and nature plants her garden.
The first thing that demands notice is that she is weaving upward— upside down, a careless first thought would say. The bottom of her fine wallet is suspended from a pole, most primitive of warping beams, stuck into the roof of the barabra. John Smith’s Indians used a limb of a tree (fig. 148). The Bristol Bay Eskimo now employ a stick supported on forked stakes; so do the Chilkats for their highly-prized blankets, and the tribes farther south to make cedar-bark garments. Indeed, the loom is about to be born. With a lens it will be seen that the basket maker is doing the best work, in which every variety of Aleutian technic is engaged. Her costume shows her to be in the current of world-embracing commerce and thought. The plants about her and the precious work of her fingers, together with the ideas in her attentive mind, are survivals from the past.
‘The basket work of the Tlinkit Indians is superb. Everyone who sees it is struck with its delicacy of workmanship, shape, and ornamentation. Most of the specimens in the National Museum collection are of the bandbox shape, but they can be doubled up flat like a erocer’s bag. (Plates 65 and 67.) The material of foundation and sewing is the young and tough root of the spruce, split, and used either in the native color or dyed brown or black. The structure belongs to the twined type before mentioned and there is such uniformity and fineness in the warp and woof that a water-tight vessel is produced with very thin walls. In size the wallets vary from a diminutive trinket basket to a capacity of nearly a bushel. All sorts of designs in bands, crosses, rhombs, chevrons, triangles, and grecques are produced thus: First, the bottom is woven plain in the color of the material. In a great many pieces’a row of plain weaving alternates with the twined weaving for economy. Then in the building up of the basket bands of plain color, red and black, are woven into the structure, having the same color on both sides.“ Afterwards little squares or other plain figures made into designs are sewed on in
“See G. T. Emmons in the Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, New York, 1903. This paper is the result of twenty years’ work among the Tlinkits by a patient observer, and should be studied with special care.

aresene, or what is here called false embroidery, that is, only halfway through, giving the most varied effect on the outside, while the inside shows only the plain colors and the red and black bands. Wild rye straws (/7ymus) for coarse work and hair grass (Deschamps/a) on fine work are used in this second operation, in plain rich golden color or dyed, being whipped over and over along the outer threads of the underlying woof. Other grasses for false embroidery are Panicularia nervata, Calamagrostis langsdorfii, Cinna latifolia, and Bromus sitchensis. (See Plate 145.)
No more attractive form and ornamentation are to be seen than those produced by the Indians of this Tlinkit stock.
The Tlinkit recognize five styles of weave, not including the fishtrap, the false embroidery in grasses and plant stems, and the plaited borders. These are all in twined weaving, the progress of the work being from left to right and the outer woof strand sloping downward. Lieutenant Emmons gives the native name of each as follows:
1. Plain close-twined weaving, Wush tookh 4 r-kee (** close together work”), which is perfectly water-tight and is the standard weave of fully three-quarters of all baskets made. It consists of the simple twining of two woof strands around each successive thickness of warp splints. The regular weave produces the vertical ridge-like appearance in the line of the warp, the polished exterior surface of the root forming the outside or ornamental face of the work.
An openwork work basket in this plain twined weaving is known as Khart (‘‘a strainer,” literally, ‘‘ will not hold water”). It is used in trying out fish oil and in cooking and straining berries.
2. Twined and checker weaving, Khark gheesnit (** between,” ** in the middle of”), from the introduction of a single woof strand in checker or wicker weaying between the lines of the regular twined stitch. It gives a broken, irregular effect from the exposure of the warp along the line of the single weft, as well as from the dull, fibrous surface of both of these strands, which are of the coarsest inner sections of the root. This weave is of a later origin; the plain weaving has been borrowed from the mainland and from the more southern people. It is characteristic of the cedar-bark work from Frederick Sound to the Straits of Fuca. It is wanting on the oldest specimens of Yakutat baskets. Its use is confined to the coarser work, such as the plaque-like berry, sewing, and workbaskets of the woman, the bottoms of the baskets and the unexposed tops of the covered basket. It is in great favor among the Chilkat, who make many large baskets. It is used for economy, both in the quantity and the quality of the material, as one woof strand is saved in every three and in the more valued exterior root section the saving is one-half. But its disadvantages are loss of strength, rigidity, and closeness of texture, and it does not admit of the embroidery in grasses and plant stems, which is the characteristic feature of Tlinkit basketry. (See fig. 140.)

<<<Page: 439>>>

3. Diagonal twined weaving, Hiktch hee ha r-see (rough or uneven, like the skin of the frog’s back, from its mottled character), is formed by the simple twining of two woof strands about pairs of warp elements. The weave separates the pairs in each superimposed line of woof,and breaks joints in the units of weave, just as in myriads of Attu and Ute baskets. (See Plates 96,143.) Itis, in fact, well-known twilled weaving. This weave was never extensively used among the Tlinkit, except as a skip stitch in conjunction with the ordinary twining (No. 1), whereby a number of geometric figures are produced which form the ornamentation of the Haida hat rimand the Chilkat basket border. As a weave it seems to have been confined to the double basket.
Shuck kuhk (strawberry basket) has erroneously been classed as a type of weave, but it is simply a variation of the regular twined weave (No. 1), in which the woof strands are of different colors, so that in both the vertical and the horizontal lines there is produced a variety of effects, supposed to resemble the seed-covered surface of the wild strawberry. This character of ornamentation is more commonly found in bands on the women’s workbasket and on mats of basket covers. The flecking of the surface of twined ware with dark and light spots is not confined to the Tlinkit, but will be observed among all Western tribes that have this weave.
4. Crossed-warp twined weaving, Wark kus-ka rt (‘‘eye holes” from the polygonal meshes of the openwork weave), in which the warp splints are drawn aside from the perpendicular at a fixed angle, the odd numbers trending one way and the even numbers the other. These cross each other successively in parallel series, just after which they are inclosed and held in place by the ordinary twining of two-woof strands. ‘The size of the meshes is regulated by the distance apart of the spirals of the weave. This type was used for rather long, flat cases or bags, but more particularly for spoon baskets, which are fitted with a twisted root handle to hang them to hooks or pegs on the wall. In later years ornamental baskets are often made in this weave.
5. Three-strand twined weaving, Uh ta’hk-ka (twisted). This gives a longer winding, rope-like appearance to the weave outside, while on the inside the regular twining stitch in its ridge-like regularity is seen. It is strengthening as well as decorative and is often met with in circles at intervals near the bottoms of the larger, older baskets, which are required for the heavier work. It is in general use to-day as a single line of woof around the outer circumference of the cylinder basket, where the warp splints are bent upward to form the sides. Its more important use has been in the construction of the crown of the hat as well as of the cylindrical ornaments surmounting it, and other ceremonial headdresses among both the Haida and the Thinkit.
The Tlinkit do not seem to have learned, or were forbidden by

<<<Page: 440>>>

economy, in doubling the warp splints, to use strips from the outside of the root and to lay the wrong sides together so as to have both surfaces smooth. This is shown in the mixed twine and checker work on the bottoms of baskets.
Plate 146 is a collection of Tlinkit twined basketry made from the roots of the spruce and decorated in false embroidery with wild rye or hair grass, either in the natural color or dyed. It will be observed that the figures do not appear on the inside of the wallet. Attention is also ‘alled to the very fine workmanship on these old specimens, especially
upon the large one in the middle. The ornamentation, in its symbolism,

has reference to natural features and waterways. The composition of the ornament is in triangles and parallelograms.
Fig. 137, Catalogue No. 21560 U.S. National Museum, is a twined basket wallet of the Tlinkit Indians. It is of band-box shape when spread out, but here shown as folded for transportation. The bottom, warp, and twine is very roughly made of spruce root splints, the former radiating from the center. The boundary of the bottom is a single row of three-strand twine. This method of ornamenting and strengthening their work was used by the Tlinkits, not only at the bottom, but along the sides and near the top. The rest of the body is in stripes of natural spruce root color, in black and Indian red, done in false embroidery.

<<<Page: 441>>>

Figs. 138 and 139 illustrate the method of making false embroidery on the basketry of the Tlinkit Indians. As the woman proceeds with her work she wraps the grass stem once around each strand of the regular twine when it comes outside. On the inside, therefore, there is no appearance of ornament; the figure plainly shows how this work is done and it might be called a type of three-strand twined weaving in which one of the elements passes inside the warp. Ornamentation on this ware is also produced by dyeing the filaments of which the basket is made. This specimen is Catalogue No. 20726 in the U.S. National Museum, and was collected by James G. Swan.

The group is a study in more respects than in basketry. They are all clad in trade goods. As to jewelry, one wears her rings on her fingers, but the chief woman has hers in the septum of her nose. Old forms of basketry are mingled with covered bottles and the ubiquitous can (Kanastron), formerly a basket both in Greek and Tlinkit, stands by the side of the genuine article.

From the Chilkat Indians about Mount St. Elias southward to the Nez Percés of Idaho, blankets are woven from the wool. These fabrics are, in their manufacture, the transition from basketry to loom work. They are in twined weaving. The only shuttles are the skillful fingers of Indian women; the warp hangs down loose from a pole or bar, and the work of twine is upward, precisely as in Haida basketry. (See Plate 148.)
Vernon Bailey says of the material that the winter coat of the mountain goat is a dense piece of long, soft wool, with strong, coarse hairs scattered through it. In spring and early summer, when the wool is being shed, and hangs in loose strings on the. goat, it catches on bushes and rocks and the low branches of timber line trees. On

Their basket work is all in twined weaving and differs from
that of the Tlnkits in artistic finish only, owing probably to the demands of trade. Their wallets of spruce are devoid of decoration, save here and there a band in plain black color, as would be the Tlinkit without embroidery; but hats made by these Indians are masterpieces in execution and ornamental weaving. The crown is in three strand or plain twined weaving of the most delicate workmansliip, and the fabric is perfectly water-tight when thoroughly wet. Ornamentation is introduced into the brims by a series of diamond patterns in twilled weave covering the whole surface. This decoration is produced thus: Beginning

“ A very interesting instance of survival is to be seen in the rag carpets of these Indians. The missionaries have taught the women to save up their rags and to cover their floors with pretty mats. They are allowed to weave them in their own way, however, and the result is constructed on the ancient twined model, precisely as the
weaving is done on the mats and hats.

Especial attention is here called to the sharpened stake which has a circular board on top. This is driven into the ground, and the woman seated works upward instead of downward, as in most cases. This specimen, Catalogue No. 89033 in the U. S. National Museum, was procured in Queen Charlotte Archipelago by James G. Swan. (See fig. 148.) It will be remembered that in an ancient drawing showing how the Virginia women made basketry the woman is seated in precisely the same fashion and is working from below upward.

The material is splints of spruce, some of which have been dyed simply by immersing in dark-colored mud.

The families to be visited will be the Chimmeseyan, Wakashan or Abt, Salishan, Shahaptian, and Chinookan. Other smaller groups are scattered around and will be treated at the proper place in the text. The transition from southeastern Alaska to this area is almost imperceptible in some respects and radical in others. The Tlinkit false embroidery will not disappear, but it will be remanded to a far humbler place. The roots and inner bark of the cedar will occupy the front rank. Coiled and imbricated work, unknown among the Tlinkits and Haidas, will bloom out in British Columbia and Washington. The semiflexible wallet will be replaced by the rigid cooking basket and the soft bags of hemp. The differentiation from the next area south of it will also be marked.

<<<Page: 448>>>

The small Chimmeseyan family, also called Tsimshian and better known as Nass, are the extreme northern of the group. Their hasketry is of root and runs largely into the mixed twined, checker, and twilled.
Necessarily coming southward from the spruce-root country to the cedar area would have the effect to change much of the basketry from rigid surfaces to flexible and from twined weaving to checker and twilled work. The National Museum possesses no specimens of Chimmeseyan ware of striking individuality.
The Wakashan tribes occupy northern and western Vancouver Island, the coast of British Columbia, and a small point of land in the northwest corner of Washington. They are generally known by the name Aht or Nootka on Vancouver Island, and include Boas’s Kwakiutl and the Bella Bella and Haeltzuk on the mainland. In recent years they have been studied by Boas, by Tolmie and Dawson, and by Swan.
A list of authorities will be found given by J. W. Powell” and by Boas.’
In addition to the matting, both checker and twilled, quite common throughout this region, the Wakashan tribes of Vancouver Island and Washington make a type of basketry which is called in this paper the bird-cage or wrapped twined work, in which one element of the weft remains inside of the basket, and the other element, Fic. 149. which is more flexible, is wrapped tee ieee about the decussations of the warp and the rigid element of the weft. It might also be called the ‘“fish-trap” style, since without doubt the finer basketry is the lineal descendant of the rude wicker fish trap. Imagine a number of stakes driven into the ground pretty close together. A horizontal pole is laid against them in the rear, and by the wrappings of a withe around the pole and each upright stake diagonally on the outside and vertically on the inside a spiral fastening 1s produced. It is shown in the openwork basket, Catalogue No. 23480, U. S. National Museum, made by a Clallam Indian. This wrapping crosses the two fundamentals in front at an angle and the horizontal frame piece in the rear at right angles, and the lacing may always run in the same direction, or the alternate rows of lacing may run in opposite directions, as in fig. 149. As a matter of fact, in a soft and pliable material this operation pushes the uprights forward a little, giving to the fabric an appearance of the lathe work on the back of a watch. (See fig. 1502)

Clark described them as ‘‘made of cedar bark and bear grass interwoven in the form of a European hat with small brim. They formed a a small article of traflic with the whites, and their manufacture is one of the best exertions of Indian industry.” They say that ‘* the only covering for their head is a hat made of bear grass and the bark of cedar interwoven in a cone form with a knob of the same shape at the top. The colors are generally biack and white only, and the designs are squares, triangles, and rude figures of canoes and seamen harpooning whales.” Captain Cook found the same form of head covering worn by the Indians of Nutka Sound. (See Plate 151.)
Mr. Willoughby“ describes the hats in the Peabody Museum (Plate 151) as follows:
They are all in twined weaving, and are made principally of cedar bark and grass spires. The construction is double, as shown in the cross section (fig. 153). Hach headpiece consists really of two hats, an inner and an outer one, joined at the rim, the

last few pairs of twisted woof elements of the outer hat inclosing also the ends of the warp of the inner. The inner hat, or lining, is coarsely but neatly woven of cedar bark, and only in one specimen is there a knob at the top of the lining cc yrresponding to that of the outer hat. Upon the underside at about 3 inches from the rim each warp element is doubled upon itself, forming a loop about three-fourths of an inch long. Through these loops is run a strong double cord of Indian hemp. The loops are bound together by twined weaving (fig. 152), and form an inner rim edged with the cord of hemp, which fits the head snugly. To this ‘s fastened the thong which passes beneath the chin of the wearer.
The exterior or outer hat is woven principally of grass spires and cedar bark. In most of the specimens a narrow strip below the knob is made of fine cedar roots. The warp appears to be formed of split roots, and is fine and strong. The grass of the woof was originally an ivory white, the selected cedar bark used in conjunction with it being usually stained a dark brown or black.
Fach strand of the twisted pair of woof elements forming the design is composed of a grass spire overlaying a strip of cedar bark of the same width, the strand

thus formed being white upon one side and black upon the other. These double strands are used not only where figures appear, but throughout the groundwork of the design as well. The figures are principally black upon a white ground. In forming them the strands are simply reversed, the black sides which were concealed beneath the grass spires in the white background being carried outward. In some of the specimens the knob at the top is woven separately and afterwards joined to the hat. (See figs. 152,153. )
Comparing the descriptions with the technical processes worked out in this paper, it is evident that the Nutka tribes understood what is called overlaying. It is not the Makah wrapped weaving nor like the Nez Percé and other Shahaptian weave, but wiil be found in the Modoe and other California tribes as well as abundantly among the Salish. (See Plate 155, fig. 5.) The double hat is suggestive of the Orient, from which the royal Spanish fleet returned by way of Vancouver every year for two centuries (1570-1770).
The National Museum has an example of twilled weaving from Vancouver Island, which should be compared with Clallam ware. It is a large fish basket made from the split root of a cedar. Attempts at ornamentation are, first, in using alternately the smooth, natural wood and the inner, coarse surface of the splint, also by introducing strips in cedar root with the bark adherent, and finally, by laying on the outside certain strips the leaves of bear grass. With this variety of material, although the basket is as coarse as it can be, the effect is excellent. The finishing off is in three rows of twined weaving, in which black yarn and bewr grass are laid on the fiber to give variety and color. The upright elements in the weaving are bent down on the inside and held together by a continuous row of buttonhole stitches. On the border is a scallop formed by a two-strand rope which passes underneath the border, back and through itself. Dimensions: height, 18 inches: width, 24 inches. Collected by G. T. Emmons. (See Plate 152.)
Plate 153 is a delightful mixture of two extremes in culture. Two Makah or Nutka women are clad in calico, woolen blanket, piano cover, bandana handkerchiefs, etc., not neglecting the latest patent in safety pins. They are seated on a mat of cattail (Zypha latifolia) stems, sewed together in genuine aboriginal fashion, known before Columbus. And their fingers are following their conservative thoughts as though these cunning weavers had been born centuries ago. They are making from filaments of cedar bark and leaves of squaw grass the kind of twined weaving called wrapped in this paper (figs. 15, 14). The warp is plain, twisted from cedar bark. One element of the weft is of the same material and laid horizontally inside the warp; the other weft element, of squaw grass (Xerophyllum tenax), is wrapped in a continuous coil about the intersections of the other two elements. The photograph is from Capt. D. F. Tozier.

One of the largest families and most diversified, so far as industries are concerned, are the Salishan tribes, east and south of the Wakashan A small and detached body of them are to be found on Bentinck Arms, northern British Columbia, hemmed in on the east by Athapascan tribes and on the west by Wakashan tribes. The rest of the famity are spread out in British Columbia and Washington, extending from Puget Sound northward, southward, and eastward across Idaho and even into Montana. A small body of the same family are on the Oregon coast, about the forty-fifth parallel.
Situated as these tribes are, in the midst of so many other linguistic families, it is not surprising to find a great variety in the types of their basketry. In the plates here shown (Plates 154 and 155) fig. t
oe e¢, in which both warp and weft pass over two; fig. 3, another form of twilled work, in which warp and weft pass alternately over two and under one. Figs. 4 and 5 show the methods of coiled and imbricated sewing in the bottom and on the body of a Thompson River or a so-called Klikitat basket. Especial attention will be called later to these types. Fig. 6 is plain twined weaving in openwork. Fig. 7 is an example of plain twined weaving in openwork over crossed warp

of a special character in which every alternate one is vertical and the other inclined. It can be easily seen by looking at the figure that warps arranged vertically and parallel, every other one turns to the left and is caught, not in the twist just above it, but in the first one beyond. Figs. 8 and 9 show the outside and inside of. !atticed or bird-cage work; fig. 10, a form of twined work in which the tough fiber is overlaid by grass leaves or other colored fiber, adding to the ornamentation but not to the strength; fig. 11, false embroidery, in which the outer element of the twine is wrapped with an additional filament. Myron Eells, who has spent many years among them, and to whom Plates 154 and 155 are to be credited, asserts that styles of weaving peculiar to the stocks near by are practiced by afew women of Salishan tribes. This can be accounted for in two ways—women from these outside stocks may have married into the tribes under consideration, or, as is frequently the case, the Salish women, in order to learn something new, have taken up the methods of their neighbors. Immediately south of the Haidas and Tlinkits, the bark of the white cedar (Zhiwja plicata) becoming common, the inner portion is quite tenacious, and since filaments of almost any required width and length may be obtained, checkerwork weaving is in demand for mats, sails, receptacles for all sorts of objects, parts of house furniture, and even of clothing. The figure here shown is a typical example of many hundreds of such baskets to be found in collections. The

<<<Page: 453>>>

bottom and sides are in the same type of weaving. By an endless variety of real and proportional width of warp and weft and by coloring some of the strips an indefinite number of patterns may be produced. (See fig. 154.)
In many cedar-bark receptacles of this region the two sets of filaments—warp and weft—run diagonally; that is, they are not woven as ina loom, but the maker begins at the corner. Looked at vertically, the surface has a diamond rather than a checker appearance, but from the point of view of the maker the intersections are square. Again, but much more rarely, three sets of filaments are involved, two belonging to the warp and the other one to the weft. The warp elements cross at right angles or less, and the weft element runs across through the intersections, making a series of rhombs. This same technic is almost universal in Japan.
Fig. 154. CHECKERWORK BASKET,
Bilhula Indians, British Columbia.
Collected by James G. Swan.
In addition to the oblique method of weaving the checker patterns in cedar bark, occasional diagonally or twilled weaving is to be seen in the same area.
A large callacaes of these were gathered by James G. Swan along the coast of British Columbia, and are now for examination in Abe U.S. National Museum.
Ornamentation in bark work is effected both by introducing different colored strands and by varying the width of the warp and the woof threads. In many examples the bottom of the basket is bordered and outlined with one or more rows of the twined or plaited style of weaying to give greater stability and definition to the form. Cedar mats of large size and made with the greatest care enter as extensively into the daily life of the Indians of this vicinity as do the buffalo robes into that of the Dakota Indians.
The Bilhulas made very neat baskets, called ‘*Zeibusqna” as well as hats and water-tight vessels, all of fine cedar roots.

They boil the cedar root until it becomes pliable to be worked by the hand and beaten with sticks, when they pick the fibers apart into threads. The warp is of a different material—sinews of the whale, or dried kelp thread.
They also are expert in weaving the inner bark of the cedar.
It is not astonishing that a material so easily woven should have found its way so extensively in the industries of this stock of Indians. Neither should we wonder that the checker pattern in weaving should first appear on the west coast among the only people possessing a material eminently adapted to this form of manipulation. It is only another example of that beautiful harmony between man and nature which delights the anthropologist at every step of his journey.
Farther south in British Columbia a Salish people demanding careful attention are those formerly called Couteau or Knife incteae by the Hudson Bay Company’s people. Their home is the southern interior of British Columbia, mostly east of the Coast Range, and is about 100 miles long and 90 miles wide. Their basketry is described by James Teit of Spences Bridge, British Columbia.“ The basket work above Lytton is of birch eae spruce bark, and willow twigs and the rims ornamented with stitches made from the bark of Prunus demissa. The Indians on the lower division of the Thompson River and on the Upper Fraser make beautiful coiled and imbricated baskets of cedar roots (7huja plicata) This type of basketry is also made by the Chilcotin and Lillooet, and Shushwap, who are said to employ spruce root.
William Arnott, of North Bend, gives the following Thompson River Indian names for baskets: Tsai, ordinary oblong style; spanach, small oblong and square; spa panach, very small; nikwoeten, round; spanikwoeten, small round; sklokw, very large.
Wallets are made of a twined weaving, the character of which is shown in Teit’s fig. 182. Designs on these fabrics are in embroidery or by weaving colored grasses or bark twine into the fabric, as shown in the same figure. This style of weaving seems to have been acquired recently through intercourse with the Sahaptin.
The Lower Thompson Indians weave mats of strips of cedar bark of the same style as those used by the coast Indians (Teit’s fig. 133).
At the present day rag mats or rugs are often made from scraps of cloth, calico, ete. The patterns on these are mostly the same as those on basketry.
The Thompson Indians also practice twined weaving in coarse bagging and in matting from tule (Se¢rpus), bulrush (7ypha latifolia), and the twined weft of the bark of Apocynum cannabinum. ‘These Indians also knew how to make mats by stringing them. The reed or stick is perforated at two or more places and a cord passed through the holes.
It is interesting to find among them also blankets made t from twisted
aweninns ef the Neches Museum of Natural ace TI, 1900, pp. 163-392.

<<<Page: 455>>>

strips of rabbit skin used as weft and laid together by twined weaving. Attention is especially called to a method of ornamental overlaying among the Thompson River Indians that has not a wide distribution. An ordinary wallet is made of twined work from the fiber of Apocynwm cannabinum and Asclepias speciosa. In the fabric these do not differ from the world-wide twined weaving, but in the ornamentation a strip of grass or other colored material—maybe corn husk—is wrapped around the twined work as it proceeds. Comparing this with the Makah wrapped work the twined weft takes the place of the strip laid behind the vertical warps, the wrapping is precisely the same, but in the Thompson River work the patterns are quite similar on both sides, only the elements are oblique on the outside and vertical on the inside.
The weaving of blankets by basketry processes was formerly an important industry among them. ‘The coast Indians utilized both dog hair and goat hair in their manufacture, but the Thompson Indians seemed to have used the latter only. Sometimes the wool was made whiter or cleaned by mixing a quantity of baked white diatomaceous earth with it and beating the whole with a flat stick. The manner of making the thread is exactly the same as that described by Dr. Boas for the process employed by the Songish. The loom and spindle are also the same, excepting that both disk and shaft of the latter are of wood. ‘The whole process of blanket making and the implements used are said to be exactly the same as those found among the Lower Fraser Indians. Most blankets had a fringe of tassels, 6 to 9 inches in length, along oneend. Black bear’s hair made into threads, and spun threads of goat’s hair dyed either yellow with Hchens or red with alder bark, were woven into the blankets in patterns similar to those used in basketry. The Indians of Spuzzum continue to make these blankets at the present day.
For making nets, threads of the bark of Apocynuwm cannabinum were used. A wooden netting stick (Teit’s fig. 184) served for making the meshes of equal size. ‘The meshes were tied with a square knot.
The Rey. Myron Eells states that the imbricated basketry is made by the Puyallups, Twanas, Snohomish, Clallam, Skagit, Cowlitz, Chehalis, Nisqually, Spokan, and Squakson who are Salish, as well as by the Yakima and Klikitat Indians of middle and western Washington who are Shahaptian. Only women and girls are basket makers; they use in securing material the ordinary root digger. Pieces of the desired length and about the thickness of a finger are buried in the ground to keep them fresh. When required they are taken out and peeled with a sharp stone or knife and hung up to dry. When needed they are split into long strips by means of the bone awl. The pieces of the desired width and thickness throughout are used for stitching; the others form the foundation of the coil,

<<<Page: 456>>>

which in the weaving is kept of uniform thickness by adding fresh material. Foundations are also in narrow strips of wood. Mr. Teit makes the important assertion that the stitches of the preceding coil are intentionally split by the awl. Examples of this kind of work are common in collections. On the bottom and back as well as ends of the baskets ornamental strips are often overlaid or decorated by a process here called beading. In many examples strips of cedar and other woods are used as foundations. The method of ornamentation employed is imbrication, described on page 310, the material for the overlaying being a glossy yellow-white grass.
As soon as enough is known about the geographic distribution of this imbricated type of weaving a better classification can be made. The following characteristics will suflice as a general guide:
lL. Foundation.—Either a bundle of splints, somewhat cylindrical in form, or narrow flat strips of wood usually laid in pairs.
2. Sewing.—All done in splints of root; in some baskets the stitch is carefully and systematically bifurcated on the outside, in others whole.
3. Bottom. —Either a flat spiral circular or ellipticel in outline, as in most of the Washington varieties and in some of the farthest removed of the British Columbia specimens, or a series of straight rows of sewing. The bottoms of many of the baskets of this last type are receding, and even a border is built up outside of the structure of the basket. (Compare Plate 157 with Plate 163.)
4. General shape.—Kither conical, rectangular, pyramidal, or fanciful.
5. Decoration. Designs covering the whole surface; designs on the upper part of the surface only; and designs around the middle, leaving the top and bottom plain or separately figured. In some beading is mixed with the imbricated ornament. It may not amount to tribal differences, but some baskets are decorated in front with imbrications, and plain or beaded on the back and ends. It is impossible with the knowledge at present in hand to make a perfect ethnie chart of this wonderfully varied type of workmanship.
Plate 156 is a covered basket box in imbricated coiled work, from Douglas Harbor, British Columbia, now in the collection of Fred Harvey, Albuquerque, New Mexico. The foundation and sewing are of cedar or spruce root, and the imbrications are in squaw grass and cedar bark. The noticeable feature in this specimen is the coiled work. In order to diminish the amount of sewing, the basket maker has thought of the expedient used by the Mescalero Apache Indians of the south, and seen on specimens from other localities, of widening the foundation of the coil. In the Douglas Harbor examples, strips of wood take the place of two or more stems arran another.

baskets, showing both imbrication and overlaying with grass. The specimens shown in this plate are in the collection of Miss A. M. Lang, The Dalles, Oregon. They should be examined carefully with respect to the characteristics of foundation, stitch, shape, design, and quality mentioned above.
Fig. 155 is a precious old coiled and imbricated basket. The bottom is made up of fifteen foundation rods laid parallel. Each one of these is overlaid by a strip of bright yellow squaw grass. Thus prepared, these rods are sewed together by coil stitching, which are split or bifurcated, and some trifurcated i in the operation. Again, while the stitching is solid on the inside, those in sight are from oneeiemtn to one-fourth of an inch apart on the outside, showing that every other stitch is under the straw.

bottom the regular coiled work begins and the body is built up, the stitches all being concealed by what in this treatise is called imbricated ornament or knife plaiting, carefully described and illustrated elsewhere. In this example the ornamentation is In squaw grass, cherry bark, and cedar bark, dyed black. (See figs. 52-55.)
The foundation of the coiled work is not a single rod, but a bunch of splints made from the cedar root. Catalogue No. 60235 in the U.S. National Museum was procured from Sitka, Alaska, Indians by J.J. McLean, to which place it had doubtless drifted in trade from the Fraser River region. Its length is 8} inches and height 34 inches.
Mr. Hill-Tout reports that for boiling their food the N’tlaka pamuq tribe (Salishan family), on the Fraser and the Thompson River, always used basket kettles made like their other basketry from the split roots of the cedar. These roots are sometimes red and black, and very

beautiful patterns are made from the three different colors. The red dye was obtained from the bark of the alder. tree, and the dark stain
ras obtained by soaking the roots? in biack slime or mud, or from the root of a fern (Franz Boas).
Dr. G. M. Dawson, in his ‘* Notes on the Shuswap people of British Columbia,” tells us that these baskets were made from roots of the spruce, and Dr. Boas, in his report on the Shuswaps, informs us that the basketry of the Shuswaps and N’tlaka pamuq always used the root of the cedar. As the N’tlaka pamuq were preeminent in basket making, it is possible that the information gained by Mr, Hill-Tout may be accepted as correct, although the cedar (7/uja) is not abundant in the Thompson River country.’ So skillfully did the women make these baskets that they would hold liquids without trouble. In preparing food two kettles were used, one containing water for washing off any dirt that might adhere to the heated stones, and the other for holding the food. In boiling salmon for eating, the fish were tied up in birch bark to prevent breaking and falling to pieces.
The Washington or southern imbricated ware is far more true to the old type than the northern, as examples will show. It may be divided roughly between Salishan and Shahaptian. (See Plate 1538.)
The Klikitat or Shahaptian basket (Plate 158, fig. 2) is thus made: The foundation consists of the roots of young spruce and cedar trees. They are macerated and split or torn into shreds and soaked for a long time. The materials for the ornamentation are thus prepared. Most of itis of squaw grass (Yerophyllum tenax). It grows on the east side of the Cascade Mountains and can be gathered only during the late summer, when the snow has melted and the grass has matured. ‘The broad leaves are split into the requisite width and if they are to retain their natural color are soaked in water only. To be dyed they are soaked in mud and charcoal for black, in a dye from willow bark for brown, and a long time in water for yellow. In some cases cedar bast is dyed black instead of the grass, but it is not so durable, or willow bark takes the place of the grass, but the surface shrivels. Witb the three elements of structure around her, the Klikitat basket maker makes up a roll of root splints for the beginning of her foundation, which she wraps at one end for an inch with sewing splint. Doubling this she begins her over and over sewing, splitting, sometimes with exquisite taste and care, the wood of the stitch underneath. The ornamentation covering more or less the surface of every Klikitat basket, called imbricated work, is laid on in the process of manufacture. The woman (1) catches the end of a strip of grass or bark under a stitch, (2) bends the strip forward to cover the stitch, (3) bends it back on itself, leaving about
« According to Dr. Boas the black dye was obtained from the fern root. It is possible it was gotten in both ways. » Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1899, p. 511.

one-eighth of an inch for the next stitch to rest on, (4) makes her stitch, draws it home, and bends the grass strip over and covers it. It isa kind of knife plaiting held down by coiled sewing and is an invention of this region.“

The imbricated basketry of Washington is divided by Mrs. Molson into two classes, by districts. The eastern slope of the Cascade or Yakima district belongs to the arid plateau of eastern Washington and the basket technic is heavy, staunch, and of good workmanship, but it shows the effect of climate. But the western or Cowlitz River district produced the perfect imbricated basket, with more coils to the inch, more stitches in the same space and also more beautiful designs.
Tam indebted to Mrs. Harriet K. McArthur for copies of the old records relating to the southern imbricated baskets. The most absoluteiy beautiful and perfect baskets of this type were made on Cowlitz and Lewis rivers in Washington. These places are but a short distance from Portland, over in Washington. No imbricated baskets were ever made south of the Columbia, the finest and best are from west of the Cascade Mountains. The shaping is more graceful, being woven much finer, and the designs are far more intricate. They ‘rarely have the openings around the top for lacing strings. Beautiful ones come from the Skokomish Reservation and from the coast, but they may have reached these remote places through the medium of trade.
Immersion in water, charcoal, and bark dyes is practiced. Cherry bark is employed much in British Columbia, and sometimes by the Klikitats who occasionally put in willow bark which shrinks and leaves an ugly stitch. The rare ones with colors—not the fine old brown, yellow, and black, but old rose and purple, are valuable because they are rare. ‘The old rose is a berry stain and the purple is from a root; but they will never rival the old brown in beauty.
The typical coiled and imbricated baskets from west Washington, therefore, may be called the Cowlitz type. According to Dr. Boas most of them are made on the Cowlitz River and north to Fraser River. He also bears witness that the split sewing and the interlocking of stitches are both practiced. The Athapascans seem to have dwelt originally in this area, and it is just possible that they carried the coiling everywhere.
The so-called Klikitat baskets are now found on the Yakima Reserration, in Klikitat and Cowlitz counties, along the Columbia River, in the vicinity of The Dalles.

Plate 159 represents old Klikitat baskets, coiled and little imbricated, in the collection of Miss Anne M. Lang, The Dalles, Oregon. At once the difference will be seen between these conical and quite aboriginal forms and those of rectangular shapes farther north in the Fraser and Thompson River countries. The method of ornamentation is the same, but the borders are finished off with considerable skill and taste in braided work. In the National Museum are photographs of excellent old pieces in the Harvey collection in Albuquerque. For the sake of comparison, Plate 160 is inserted to show later and more highly embellished forms.
The baskets made in imitation of a trunk are used for a similar purpose and not for berries. The Hudson Bay and other people brought umphor trunks from the Hawaiian Islands, taken there from China. The work is wonderfully good in this as well as in others. The interesting part is that the weavers before this time had made baskets with rounded bottoms, and began, of course, with the coil in the center; but the oblong shape with corners was another matter, so a thin board was covered with cloth to form the bottom, and on the edge of this the bone awl was used to make perforations to fasten the first row on this bottom. Later baskets had an ingeniously woven bottom over a number of narrow slats, and the patient weaver subsequently mastered an oblong coil.
From a report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Governor Isaac L. Stevens, 1854, the following statements are taken in order to comprehend the migrations of the tribe after whom imbricated ware has been popularly named:
The tribes of the Klikitat and Yakima inhabit properly the valley lying between Mounts St. Helena and Adams, but they have spread over the districts belonging to other tribes and a band of them is now located as far south as Umpqua.
The Klikitats and Yakimas in all essential peculiarities of character are identical and their intercourse is constant, but the former, though a mountain tribe, are more unsettled in their habits than their brethren. The fact is probably due in the first place to their having been driven from their homes many years ago by the Cayuses, with whom they wereat war. They then became acquainted with other parts of the country, as well as with the advantages derived from trade. It was not, however, until about 1839 that they crossed the Columbia, when they overran the Willamette Valley, attracted by the game with which it abounded and which they destroyed in deflance of the weak and indolent Callapooyas. They still boast that they taught the latter tribe to ride and hunt. They manifest a peculiar aptitude for trading.
Under the term Walla Walla (p. 223) are embraced a number of bands, living usually on the south side of the Columbia and on the Snake River, to a little east of the Palouse.
The Tai-tin-a-pam, a band of the Klikitats already mentioned, living near the head of the Cowlitz, were called by their eastern brethren wild or wood Indian.

From the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for 1858 (p. 225), Puget Sound Agency, T. Simmon, agent, is quoted:
There is a portion of the Indians of my district whose homes are high up on the river, principally on the Nisqually, Puyallup, and Snoqualmie. They are nearly related to the Yakimas and Klikitats by blood, and are sometimes called Klikitats.
R. 8. Landsdale, agent, White Salmon Agency (p. 275), writes:
Many of the Klikitats were removed during the late war from their former homes, west of the Cascade Mountains, to this agency.
The home of the Klikitat Indians, says Mrs. Molson,” was along the waters of the Columbia and its tributaries, from the Cascade Mountains on the west to the Bitter Root Range on the east, and from 46 degrees 44 minutes north, to what is now eastern Washington and northern Idaho. ‘They were not only rovers and marauders, but they went on annual expeditions to trade, carrying dried buffalo meat and robes, but.also wild hemp, dried and twisted, to exchange for dried salmon and dentalia. They held the gateway between the East and the West, for the river was the only route of communication. South of the Columbia, along the ocean, is an old path known as the ‘‘ Klikitat trail.” They journeyed south by this route and returned north by the KJamath trail on the eastern side of the Cascades. There are no indications of their being basket makers. Their kindred, still in the old home, make no imbricated ware.
Plate 161 is a typical coiled and imbricated berry basket of the K1ikitat Indians, from the collection of Mrs. R. S. Shackelford, from whom the following information is received: The inside walls, both foundation and sewing, are from splints of the root of the giant cedar (Thuja plicata), collected on the sides of Mount Hood. The ornamentation is the imbricated work described in detail on page 427, the materials being of the white Tooksi or squaw grass. Cedar and cherry bark are also used, and for color the yellow dye is procured from the Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa), the brown dye from alder bark, and the black from acorns soaked in mud. The meaning of the artistic terraced design is not known. Six months were consumed in making it. Catalogue No. 207756, U. 8. National Museum. The following story was gathered froma basket maker by Mrs. Shackelford:
The Spirit told the first weaver to make a basket (tooksi). So she repaired to the forest and pondered over her mission. Gathering the plant yi, squaw grass, elk grass, pine grass, and the red cedar roots, noo wi ash ( Thuja plicata), she began to weave, and after many toilsome days a basket was produced. She carried it to the lake and dipped it full of water, but it leaked, and the Spirit said to her: ‘‘ It will not do. Weave again a tight basket with a pattern on it.’”’ She sat by the waterside, and as she looked into the clear depths of the lake the pattern (chato timus) was revealed to her in the refracted lines, and with new courage she repaired to the depths of the forest and worked until she wrought a basket on which the ripples of

the lake were shown. Other women have learned the pattern all down the ages, but only yery few are now left who can weave a faultless basket and a perfect imitation of chato timus.
The locality where the story was learned is Lummi Island, Bellingham Bay, Washington. The pattern referred to is similar to that shown in fie. 289, of the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.

Fig. 157 is an old example of imbricated basketry from Washington, collected by Dr. J. L. Fox, U. 8S. Navy, of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, Catalogue No. 2137. Such work is now generally called Klikitat, and the lindians of that stock are expert in the use of it; but the exploring expedition did not come in contact with tribes so far in the interior. The Salish Indians on Puget Sound make the same type of work, and it is known that the very best come from the Cowlitz country, so that this is probably a very old piece of Cowlitz basketry in

Catalogue No. 2614, U. 5. National Museum, shown in Plate 45, is an imbricated basket made an Indian of Salishan family, in W acne ington. It is one of the oldest specimens in the National Museum, having been brought home by Captain Charles Wilkes more than sixty years ago. The material of the foundation and sewing is of cedar root. The surface is covered entirely with imbricated ornamentation, the body color being produced by strips of squaw grass. The figures are in cedar bark in natural color and dyed black by means of charcoal and mud. The golden color in the straw filaments is produced by longer immersion in water. The most interesting feature in this basket is the bottom, which is formed upon a strip of wood threefourths of an inch wide and 6 inches in length. It isvery closely wrapped or served with a splint of root. Upon the margin of this the coiled work begins, one round being made in plain stitches. Afterwards the patterns are attached immediately to this and extend outward to a black line on the margin, the body of the basket being completely covered with other figures,

Fig. 158 represents a specimen of twilled work by the Clallam Indians and should be compared with Nutka example, Plate 152. It is made of flat splints of white wood, resembling birch. The bottom was woven first and all of the splints by being bent upward become the warp of the sides. willed effect is produced by passing each weft splint over two and under two warp splints. The fastening off of the upper border is done by bending down the warp splints and holding them in place by a whipping of the same material. The scallop on the upper border is formed by looping the middle of two splints under the rim, twisting both pairs of ends into a twine, passing one twine through the other, and doubling down to repeat the process until the whole is finished.

Myron Fells, long a resident among the Sound tribes of Salish, has collected for the U.S. National Museum at different times many specimens of their basketry. It was he that first noticed the great diversity that exists in such small tribes as the Twana, or Towanhoosh.

They use in their work a knife for splitting material, a common awl, formerly of bone, in sewing their coiled ware. He has seen the woman using a small bone for pressing home her weft. This is rare, for the fingers are usually employed for this purpose.
Fig. 159 is a water-tight basket for cooking, marked Clallam. ‘The foundation is the single flat strip type. Attention is called to the ornamental effect produced in this work by the splitting of the under stitch by the one above it. The noteworthy feature of this type of basket, however, is in the occasional overlaying of a filament of squaw

grass or other material, which seems to be the first step toward imbrication. The grass lies over two patente: and is caught under the next stitch, passing under and over as in ** beading.” In other examples the straw is covered and revealed in the alternate stitches. It can be seen that a great variety of effects is possible in this manipulation.
A square inch from the surface of this specimen enlarged (fig. 160) will show more clearly what has been hitherto described—the interlocking stitches, the furcation of the stitches, and the overlaying with
ornamental filaments.

Fic. 159. WATER-TIGHT BASKET. Clallam Indians, Washington.
Collected by J. G. Swan.
Charles C. Willoughby, who was agent among the Quinaielt or Quinault Indians in northwestern Washington, makes the following report of their basketry:
They have the cedar bark for the foundation of basketry and strips of the pine root for rigid work, hemp, rushes, and grass for the weft and ornamentation. The grass used in strengthening the borders of mats, rain-cloaks, etc., grows on flat places. It is prepared like flax by soaking in water until the outer portion decays, when it is beaten with sticks until only the fiber remains. The yellow fiber of squaw grass used by Indians for the outside of baskets is a great source of traffic, as it is only found in this locality. The basket grass is gathered carefully, one blade at a time, to secure that part of the stalk that reaches about 6 inches under the ground before it meets

<<<Page: 466>>>

the root. .To prepare the grass for drying it is woven together at the ends with fibers of cedar bark. It is then spread upon the ground or upon roofs in the sun. When to be used it is moistened with water and split with two small knife blades, set in a stick in such a manner as to make the strips of the same width, the smaller portion being thrown away. The grass is kept moist with water while being made into baskets. The colored grasses are prepared by using aniline dyes. They were formerly colored by steeping the roots of plants that yielded a yellow coloring. A red dye was made from the bark of alder, and a paint was made of blue clay. “
Plate 162 shows a number of Quinaielt baskets in twined and overlaid weave in the collection of Miss Anne M. Lang.
Plate 163, top figure, is a wallet made from grass stems by the Quinaielt Indians. It is worthy of especial study, because the warp is horizontal and the weft vertical. Openwork figures are produced on the surface in a series of cheyroned patterns by an ingenious but very simple process. At the point where the open effect is to be produced the two strands constituting the twine do not make a half turn, but pass above and below the warp, as in ordinary plain weaving, across one warp strand. In the next round the adjoining pair are similarly treated, and thus figures are produced. At the upper and lower margin two rows of horizontal twined weaving fasten off the ends, which are braided down. On the sides the warp strands are sewed into and concealed in a coarse braid of rushes. Width, 18 inches; height, 14 inches.
Catalogue No. 151452, in the U. S. National Museum, was collected in Washington by Dr. Franz Boas.
Plate 163, bottom figure, is a Thompson River basket in the colleetion of J. W. Benham. It is introduced here for the purpose of showing how the Indian woman’s mind struggled with the problem of starting the bottom of a rectangular coiled basket. It has been said that the Thompson River Indians do not understand this process, but many old Thompsons have coiled bottoms and this technic is older than the other. The work begins by wrapping a foundation of splints with the split root of spruce or cedar for 6 or more inches. This is
Fia. 160.
@Smithsonian Report, 1886, Pt. 1, pp. 267-282.

<<<Page: 467>>>

then doubled upon itself and the sewing begins and proceeds backward and forward, as in plowing, until fifteen rows are made; the coiling then actually begins, the sewing extending not only along the sides but across the ends, making a parallelogram, which is extended for ten rows farther outward, at which place the additional ornament begins. So far it is plain coiled work with split stitches; afterwards it becomes a mixture of plain coiled work with upright bands of imbrication. Its height is 13 inches, and its width at bottom is 9$ inches.
The twined baskets of Washington, with little animals around the margin, belong to the Skokomish and other Salishan tribes about Puget Sound. When the tails turn up they are dogs or wolves; when they turn down they are horses. Especial attention has been called to the varied and tasteful effects produced by the use of the rectangular element.
Plate 164 represents two carrying wallets of the Skokomish Indians living in Washington. The examples shown are done in the style of weaving called here ‘* wrapped twine” (figs. 21 and 22).
Plate 165 shows specimens of carrying baskets made by Salish tribes in Washington; the one in the center is Tillamuk, Catalogue No. 151149 in the U. 8. National Museum, collected by Dr. Franz Boas. The others, Nos. 2709 and 23511, are very old specimens in the National Museum collection and are accredited to the Clallams. The upper one on the plate is credited to the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, secured more than sixty years ago. All of these are in plain, twined weaving with splint of root, probably spruce, made browner by soaking in mud. The ornamentation is false embroidery in squaw grass. The three methods of forming the border are noteworthy. In the upper specimen stout cable is formed by ‘‘sewing” a small bundle of root splints with the same material. This is sewed here and there to the upper margin of the wallet. The other figures show the margin finished by braiding down; the loops of root were twisted in subsequently. The animals on the margin are horses.
The specimen, Catalogue No. 23511, which is the lower one on the plate, was collected in Washington by James G. Swan.
Plate 166, upper figure, is an open twined wallet of the Tillamuk Indians, Salishan family, the remnant of which is living at Grande Ronde Agency, Oregon. The bottom of this basket is rather ingenious. The warp splints of the sides pass across the bottom also and are held together there by courses of twined weaving. At the edges of the end portions of the bottom the splints of the weft or twined work become the warp for the body. At the upper border two rows of squaw grass are beaded in. The braided border around the top is formed by the ends of the warp splints plaited together in a double row, additional material being used if necessary.

<<<Page: 468>>>

The lower figure is an open wallet of the Chinook Indians, Chinookan family, occupying formerly both sides of the Columbia River from the mouth to The Dalles, a distance of 200 miles. According to Lewis and Clark most of their villages were on the northern bank. To this family also belong the Clatsops and Wascos, to be mentioned later. The wallet illustrated in the plate is made of root in twined weaving with crossed warp. The bottom or foundation is a rectangular structure, about 4 inches square, made of double splints of root, securely lashed together backward and forward. From this central portion the splints spread out and the twined weaving begins. Additional warp elements are added from time to time as the structure widens. A coarse form of ornamentation is produced by overlaying some of the warp elements with squaw grass. The fastening off of the upper border is peculiar and on the outside imitates precisely a three-ply braid, but on the inside the structure is at once revealed. A strip of root is laid along the top of the warp elements and these are brought over in buttonhole stitch and tucked behind the strip, then cut off, making a avery rough appearance. It will be noticed that in the weaving of this wallet the half turns of the twine do not go around the crossings of the warp elements, but just below the crossings, so as to include each warp separately. On the outside of the warp splints here and there a strip of grass is regularly overlaid.
Catalogue Nos. 151447 and 151448 in the U.S. National Museum were collected by Dr. Franz Boas.
The Nez Percé Indians of the Shahaptian family, prior to the advent of the whites on the Pacific coast, made heavy and beautiful blankets of the wool of the Rocky Mountain sheep and of the hair of animals killed in the chase, dyed in different colors. The patterns are all geometric, and are, in fact, woven mosaics, each figure being inserted separately by twisting two woof threads backward and forward around the warp strands. Scarcely ever does the twine extend in stripes all the way across the blanket in a direct line.
The same Indians at present weave bags from the bast of the Indian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum) and from grass stems shredded. The figures are produced by overlaying the regular warp strands with corn husks or colored grass in false embroidery. In some examples (see fig. 161) the entire surface is covered with geometric figures; in others they are only partially covered. The Nez Percé are in the same family as the Klikitat and Yakima, but they make no imbricated baskets.
Fig. 161 is a twined wallet of the Nez Percés. The body weaving, both warp and weft, is of indian hemp. In the process of manufacture a sufficient number of warp strands were joined together in the middle by a row of twined weaving and probably suspended, the ends hanging down. ‘The weaver filled this warp with the ordinary twisted

<<<Page: 469>>>

work, proceeding from the bottom to the border. The ornamentation, in corn husk or other weak material, in the natural color or dyed, is laid on externally by what is here called false embroidery. The process was fully described and illustrated in speaking of Tlinkit weaying (fig. 189, p. 410). This specimen should be compared with the making of soft wallets among the Fraser River tribes, illustrated in Teit’s monograph, where the corn husk, instead of being wrapped merely around the outer element of the twine, passes around both strands and the figure appears on the inside of the receptacle, which is not true of the Nez Percé example.
Fig. 162 will show a square inch of this wallet, the especial feature of which is that while the rows of plain twining seem to be vertical in s the false embroidery, they are inclined to the right.
This specimen, Catalogue No. 9026 inthe U.S. National Museum, was collected in Idaho by Dr. Storrer.

The Cayuse (Waiilatpuan) and Umatilla (Shahaptian) make soft baskets in twined weaving. They are horse Indians and use their wallets for saddle bags. The material is rushes, wild hemp, corn husks, and worsted. The bottoms and undecorated portions are plaintwined work. In the figured parts the husks, split into narrow strips, are administered in four ways—by overlaying, not showing on the inside; by overlaying and twining so as to show on the inside; by false embroidery, wrapped about the weft twine elements on the outside, and by frapping the twined weft as in the Thompson River work (Mrs. McArthur).
The soft wallets illustrated in Plate 168,
often called ‘Sally bags,” were made es DETAIL OF FIG. 161.
by Wasco Indians, who belong to the Chinookan family. At present they are on the Warm Springs Reserration in Oregon, and the Yakima Reservation in Washington. The wallet in the middle of the plate No. 9041 was presented to the U.S. National Museum by Dr. James T. Ghiselin in 1869; the others were collected by Mrs. R. 8S. Shackelford and Miss E. T. Houtz. They are all made in plain twined weaving over warp of rushes, the patterns being effected by overlaying the twine of hemp with strips of fiber that in structure resemble corn husks. On the newer specimens the designs are clearly shown, representing man (tillacum), elk (mowitch), sturgeon (pish), duck (culla-culla). By observing the men’s faces in the newer specimens, it will be easy to detect the idealized faces on the fine, old wallet in the middle.
Prof. O. M. Dalton figures in ** Man” (London), I, note 17, an old Wasco basket wallet with the image of a man in knee breeches on the surface. In the National Museum are a number of new wallets bearing this same figure, but the Dalton specimens show that it has been a motive in Wasco weaving for a long period.

in plain-twined weaving. On the body of the wallets birds, beasts, and men are wrought in grass or husks of corn in corners.
Clatsops make flat mats and wallets of cat-tail rush. The latter, with strap of grass and woolen to wear across the shoulders, are excellent for carrying fish. They also construct a sack in open-twined work in roots. The fine-twined small baskets in three colors are equal to any in Oregon (Mrs. McArthur).
THE CALIFORNIA-OREGON REGION The human hand is so beautifully formed, it has so fine a sensibility, that sensibility governs its
motions so correctly, every effort of the will is answered so instantly, as if the hand were the seat of that will.—Sir CHARLES BELL.
The California-Oregon basketry region has only one definite boundary, the hard coast of the Pacific; on other sides there is no sharp ethnic limit. North, east, and south, it is full of turnstiles that move in one direction only. Tribes from far away pushed through them into this region, but if they had desired to turn their backs on abundant game, fish, and vegetal foods, they would .have been prevented by the column in the rear.
The ancient basket makers of this area knew nearly every type and technical process of the art, both in weaving and coiling. They added at least one new technical process, the tee weave. In ornamentation, imbrication is wanting as well as false embroidery, but there is quite enough else to make up the deficiency. Within the California-Oregon area there are subareas, and the following list of iinguistic families will help to unravel the tangle:
Athapascan family: Hupa, lower Trinity River and Wailaki, western slopes of the Shasta Mountains.
Chimarikan family: Trinity River.
Copehan family: Wintun under many names, western drainage Sacramento River.
Kalapooian family: The Willamette Plains, western Oregon.
Kulanapan family: Pomo, under many names, in Mendocino and Lake counties.
Kusan family: Coos River and Bay, western Oregon.
Lutuamian family: Klamath and Modoc, Upper Klamath River or Klamath Lake.
Palaibnihan family: Pit Rivers; on Pit River to eastern boundary of the State.
Pujunan family: Concow (Konkau), Maidu, Nockum (Nakum), western drainage of the Sacramento River, south of Palaihnihan.
Quoratean family: Ehnek, Karok, middle Klamath River.
Sastean family: Shastas; middle northern boundary of State.
Takilman family: Lower Rogue River, Oregon. ;
Weitspekan family: Yurok, Weitspek, Lower Klamath River.
Wishoskan family: Wishosk, Eel River, and Humboldt Bay.
Yanan family: Nozis, north of Pujunan.
Yukian family; Ashochimi, Chumaya, Napa, Tatu or Potter Valley, Yuki or Round Valley, in Potter and Round valleys.

The location of the linguistic families in California is shown on the Pa map. (See fig. 163.) A glance at the map will show how, ina way, the State is divided into northern and southern portions }
general »y a line running from San Francisco Bay to the angle of Nevada, and also in the same manner the subdivision of the northern portion of the State into three vertical sections. <A little difference exists between the nomenclature of this map and that of Powell. For instance, the Wintun are Copehan; the Maidu are Pujunan; the Yokut on this map correspond to the Powell Mariposen, but in Powell’s subdivision of tribes the Yokuts are placed in the Moquelumnan family. With these slight amendments the map will be easily understood and of great importance in locating California basketry. It is interesting to note that, while the Powell map was made long ago from vocabularies only,
fan)
the Dixon-Kroeber map is based on grammar, and yet the agreements are nearly complete. Especial attention is called to the vast area occupied by the intruding Shoshonean family from the interior basin.?
The western division of the north California area, including the coast of Oregon as well, may be divided into three locations, containing each different tribes. The most northern would be Athapascan and adjoining families; the middle division, those tribes associated in Round Valley; and the most southern of all, the Pomo.
The following list of plants carefully prepared by V. K. Chesnut, of the Department of Agriculture,’ will apply to the Hupa, the Round Valley, and Pomo basketry:
Acer macrophyllum, Pal gun sche (Yuki), maple. The Yukis of California use the bark for their basketry. The Puget Sound Indians employ it in their textiles, and Rothrock says that from the inner bark the tribes of the Pacific slope weave baskets, mats, and hats waterproof.

Adiantum pedatum. The stems of maidenhair fern attain a length of 1 to 2 feet in the redwood belt of northern California, near the coast. They form the black strands in baskets and especially basket hats.
Alnus rhombifolia, mountain alder, Un se (Yuki); Juskiat’ and Kus (Wailaki); Gashet’/i (Pomo). The fresh bark is used by the Yukis, as well as the Hupa and Klamath Indians of California, to color their basket material.

Asclepias eriocarpa, Go to la (Little Lakes); Bo ko (Concow); Machal and Chaak (Yuki), poisonous milkweed. The inner bark is used by the Eel River, Concow, Potter Valley, and Little Lake Indians for strings, nets, and other textiles.
Butneria occidentalis, Sai ka 16 (Pomo), spice bush or calycanthus. Both the wood and the bark from fresh shoots are used in basket work.
Carex, Tsu wish (Pomo), blackroot sedge. Used by the Pomo in their coiled basketry for decorating in black.
Carex sp. The long, tough rootstocks of several and perhaps most of the sedges (saw grass) in Mendocino County, California, are used by the basket makers. Great patience is exercised in tracing these from 2 to 5 feet through sand and mud and in preparing the splints. The baskets made from them are called ‘root baskets.”’ Sedge rootstocks are the most important underground material, and the baskets made from them are the strongest, most durable, and most costly. Special characteristics belong to the different species.
Carex barbarae, Dewey, Kahum, (Pomo for water-tight baskets). The rootstocks furnish the splints for the white or creamy groundwork of most Pomo baskets. They are dug out with clam shells and sticks aiding the hands and feet.“ One end of the
stock is grasped by the first and second toes, the clam shell serves for scraping away the soil, and the stick for prying out stones and loosening the ground. A woman will secure 15 to 20 strands a day. They are placed in water over night to preserve the flexibility and to soften the scaly bark, which is removed in the morning by the women. The end of the stick is chewed until the bark is separated. The wood is then held by the teeth, the other end of the stock is held taut by the first and second toes, and the bark is scraped away, leaving a tough white or tan-colored strand about one-half the original thickness. These are done up in small coils and carried by the women to the camp. Mr. Coville draws attention to a bit of primitive agriculture in this connection. The Pomo women insist that the toughest and finest roots can be obtained only at certain spots. Unconsciously they have been making this true by means of their digging sticks and clam shells, during all the years loosening the ground and removing weeds.
Carex sp., Ta tet el (Wailaki), sea grass or sedge. The roots and leaves used in basketry, especially for hats and cheap semiflexible baskets,
Ceanothus integerrimus. The Concow squaws gather the young and flexible shoots of the California lilac, Hibi, for the warp of their baskets.
Cercis occidentalis. The bark and the wood from sprouts of the redbud, Cha-ba, in Yuki; Mula, in Little Lake; Kala-a-kala, in Yokaia; and Dop or Talk, in Concow, are used in finer baskets as foundation, as weft in twined ware, and as sewing material in coiled work. The Indians produce a variety of results in Cercis. The stems are sometimes cut in winter and early spring to insure material for the next fall. The color of the bark is then slightly red, which may be darkened by exposure to smoke and blackened by soaking in dirty water, in water and ashes, or in a decoction of oak bark to which scraps of iron have been added. The bark to be used in sewing coiled baskets is separated by steaming. In twined basketry some of the white wood is left adhering to the bark, in which case designs in two colors are produced, since the willow and carex are both much darker.
Corylus californica. The slender stems of the Hazelnut, Olmam, in Yuki; Gom he ni, in Concow; Ch’ ki, in Wailaki; Cha-ba, in Little Lake, are commonly used in place of willows in Round Valley for coarse sieves and fish traps and as warp in sawgrass baskets. A baby-carrying basket at Ukiah was made from the same material. The Calapooias make the finest openwork twined basketry of hazel sticks.
The Coos and Roque river ware resembles the Shasta, the latter produce excellent work in hazel stems (Mrs. MeArthur).

Covillea tridentata, Tah sun up (Paiutes), creosote wood. It is one of the commonest industrial plants in southern California, Arizona, and southern Utah. The gum is used by the Apaches forcement. It is also used to produce a greenish-yellow dye. Owing to the odor emitted when heated, the plant is called creosote wood.
Gymnogrammea triangularis, Gold-back fern. Common on open brushy hillsides throughout Mendocino County. As in the case of the five-fingered fern, this plant grows much more thriftily near the coast. The stems are also used there in the making of baskets.
Juncus effusus Linneeus. The stalks of wire grass. Lolum, in Yuki; Cha-ba, by the Potter Valley, Little Lake, and Yokaia Pomos; and Sito by the Wailaki, are used in Mendocino County for making temporary baskets. With them also children are initiated into the art of basket making, and rackets used in gathering pinole seed as well as fish traps are woven.
Lonicera interrupta, Hai wat (Yuki), honeysuckle. The Yukis employ the flexible stems slightly for hoops in basket borders.
Philadelphus gordonianus, Ka kuss (Wailaki); Shon a hi (Little Lakes); Hawn li (Yukis), arrowwood. <A species of syringa or mock orange. The pithy stems are valued on account of their lightness for the manufacture of baskets used by women for carrying babies.
Pinus sabiniana, Pol cum ol (Yuki) nut or digger pine. Used for basketry. The more pliable wood from the root is the chief source of material used in making large V-shaped baskets, which Little Lake Indians use for carrying acorns. The root is warmed in hot, damp ashes, and strands are split off before cooling. They are brittle when dry, but after being soaked in water they are easily manipulated in the more simply woven baskets, which are made by passing the strands out and in through the numerous vertical withes that make up the skeleton. They are not sufliciently pliable, as sedge roots are, to be used like thread in wrapping round and round a horizontal withe.
Pseudotsuga mucronata. The smaller roots of the Douglas spruce, Nu, in Yuki language, are used in fine Pomo baskets. They are found in sections 8 to 10 feet long, uniform in thickness, and about the diameter of a lead pencil (quoting Hudson).
Pteridium aquilinum, Bis (Calpella Pomo); Bebi (Little Lakes); Sulala (Concows); Dos (Nomelakkis); Ma orda-git (Yokaias), the bracken fern. The hard wood is easily split into flat bands, which are sometimes used by the coast Indians for the black strands of their cheaper baskets. They are much less frequently used for this purpose by the Indians of Round Valley and Ukiah. Because susceptible of a fine polish, they are far weaker and more brittle than the saw-grass roots which compose the weft of their choicest baskets. The black color is imparted by burying in mud,
Quercus lobata, Ky am (Yuki), white oak, acorn. The bark is used to a very slight extent by the Concows to blacken strands of the redbud for use in basketry. Rusty iron is added to the water extract of the bark to produce a black solution in which the strands are allowed to remain for some time.
thus diversiloba. For dyeing the splints with which somo Pomo baskets are sewed. Dr. Hudson is quoted as saying that an intense black is produced by applying to them the fresh juice of poison oak in Pomo, Matuyaho; in Wailaki, Kots ta. The slender stems are also worked into the foundation of coiled basketry. Rhus aromatica, says Purdy, was formerly used by tribes eastward from Ukiah, as redbud is used by Pomos.
Salix argyrophylla, The white-leaved willow, Bam Kal é, in Pomo; Kalalno, in Yokaia, is considered the best for coarse baskets. It is common along Russian River, in California. It is not found at Round Valley, so these Indians would carry back small supplies of the slender stems when they returned from hop picking near Ukiah. The roots are also highly valued in making certain baskets.

Scirpus sp. The most valuable of the sedges for basket splints in Mendocino County is an. unidentified species of the bulrush, Scirpus sp., Tsuwish, in Pomo. It is an article of commerce. Being rare near Ukiah, it is purchased at a cent a root from plants collected by Clear Lake Indians and in parts of Sonoma County or along the seacoast. The rootstocks, about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, consist of three distinct tissues—the outer, brown, like parchment; the middle; and the heart, a tough, woody structure. The outer surface of this woody tissue, which makes up the great bulk of the black fiber in the finest Pomo baskets, is slightly ribbed and varies from light brown to nearly jet-black. The interior is more or less white. Some of the dark splints are used just as they are, while others are blackened with the juice of poison oak, Rhus diversiloba, or by burying them with charcoal, ashes, and earth for about eighty hours.
A detailed account of the manipulation of these rootstocks at Round Valley is given.
Smilax californica Gray, the only species of smilax in California, does not occur in Mendocino County, but is common along the headwaters of the Upper Sacramento. The fine, long trailing limbs are exceedingly strong and are used to some extent in Round Valley and perhaps at Ukiah for basket making. The Indians say that the strands have a brownish-black color.
Tumion californicum. Splints from the roots of the California nutmeg, Kahe in the Yokaia language and Ko/’-bi in Pomo, are said to be used by the Pomo in some of their fine baskets.
Vitis californica. She in (Pomo); Mot mo mam (Yuki); Kop (Numlaki); wild grape. The native wild grape of the region climbs over trees in canyons and in damp places to a height of 30 feet or more. The smaller, woody parts of the vine are extremely flexible and are very considerably used by the tribes for the rims of their large, cone-carrying baskets. It is gathered at almost any time, soaked in water and hot ashes, after which the bark is removed and the wood split into a couple of strands, which, although very coarse, are used substantially as thread. The tribes of California make ropes and various household articles from the vine.
As a connecting link between the Salish and other basketry north of the Klamath River and the true California types there is here shown the figure of an old piece of basketry brought from Oregon more than sixty years ago (tig. 164). It is the ordinary coiled weave of the West Coast, covered with red and white feathers. The feathers are caught by their stems under the stitches as the work progresses, just as in the Pomo and other California tribes of to-day. It is interesting to find this type of work so far north. It points to the fact that many of the gaps which occur in this study could have been easily filled when the Indians were in their native situations. Holmes has other figures in the same type of basketry, only the feather work is combined with the ornamentation in the weaving on the surface. Attention is called again to the fact that the imbricated ware stopped short at the Columbia River. The plaits of grass or bark overlie one another just as feathers do in the feather work, and the stem of the feather is doubled under the stitches in the same way. To be especially noted are the groups of vertical stripes on the margin and the chevroned design at the bottom. Whether there was genetic relation-

ship between the two remains to be studied out. The specimen Catalogue No. 2138 in the U. S. National Museum, was collected by Dr. J. L. Fox, U. 5. Navy, of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition. The Pacific slope branch of the Athapascan family is found in the northwestern corner of California and far northward into Oregon. On the Hupa Reservation were placed, in 1864, a number of bands scattered around Trinity River, the names of which may be found in the Smithsonian Report for 1886, Part 1. As late as 1850 the Hupa are said to have lived in pristine simplicity. Autumn supplied the all-important acorn, large quantities of which were collected and kept in store for use during the winter and spring. The vegetable food is gathered chiefly by the women. The outfit of the primitive gleaner, miller, and cook was chiefly in basket work. While no edible root or food was despised, the oak furnished the chief breadstuff. The acorns were gathered in an osier hamper about 16 inches high and 20 inches

in diameter, made in twined weaving. It was used by the women in carrying loads, supported by a band across the forehead. Filled with acorns, this hamper was placed on the back and held in position by means of a carrying pad consisting of a disk of mat 5 by 4 inches. About the middle of October the Indians beat the acorns from the trees with long poles and carry them home in these baskets. The squaws remove the hull by giving it a slight tap with a pestle. The nuts were then dried and beaten to powder in a mill with a basket hopper. The flour was soaked in a hollow scooped in the sand and cooked into a kind of mush in baskets by means of hot stones and were baked into bread in an underground oven.
If the harvest were of seeds instead of acorns, they were winnowed in another basket of close-twined weaving which the good woman had not failed to decorate with graceful patterns, following that unconquerable artistic instinct which is the heritage of all the peoples who breathe the air of the Pacific Ocean. Under the heading of

uses a multitude of functions for the Hupa basket will be described in detail.”
Dr. W. L. Jepson has determined for Dr. P. E. Goddard the materials used by Hupa in baskets. The burden basket, the baby basket, and the salmon plate are made entirely of the shoots of Cory/us rostrata var. californica. Hupa name is mik-kai-kit-loi. These shoots form foundation or warp of all other baskets except the finest hats and the covered bottles. For these shoots of willow are used, of which Salix sessilifolia and S. fluviatilis var. argyrophylla are indicated. These willows are not common in Hupa Valley. The warp stems while slimmer than those from the hazel, are said not to be so durable. They are fastened at the origin of the basket and at the beginning of the body by rounds twined with the root of certain deciduous trees. This material is called indiscriminately ‘‘ kat.” The roots of the more common willow as wellas the two mentioned are used besides the root of Alnus oregana, Vitis californica and Populus trichocarpa. The principal weft of all close-woven baskets is composed of the root of Conifere. Of the trees growing in or near Hupa the roots of Pus ponderosa, P. subiniana, and LP. lambertiana ave used. The selection of the species and of the individual trees depends on their readiness to split properly. These roots are roasted in the ground. Besides these the Hupa import from the coast, material from Sequord sempervirens and Picea sitchensis. These root materials are called ‘‘ xai.” The root of the wild grape, Vitis cal/fornica, is used in place of the coniferz roots in fine hats for the woof. For decorative work the leaves of Xerophyllum tenax serve for white, and the bark of the stems of Adiantum pedatum for black. A reddish brown is obtained by dyeing the inner part of the stem of Woodwordia radicans with the bark of Alnus oregana. The primitive method of dyeing was to chew the bark and draw the splint through the mouth just before introducing it into the woof. The alder dye is now sometimes applied by steeping in a dish but the results are said to be not so certain. Yellow is obtained by dipping the leaves of YVerophyllum tenax into a decoction of Lvernia vulpina. The setting of this dye is difficult and many women do not use the yellow in basket making. Porcupine quills are dyed with this lichen giving a brighter effect. Their use is not common. A few women are now employing the ‘‘Oregon grape” for dyeing the xerophyllum leaves. Baskets are sometimes collected for Hupa work which are made by the Tolowa in Del Norte County. These have a steel-gray color obtained by dyeing the root of the tideland spruce with rusty iron. The root and iron are buried in the damp ground for some time.?

Plate 170 represents three granary baskets of the Hupa Indians in the Harvey collection. The figure shown on the right is used as a cover for the granary. These baskets furnish excellent examples of form and decoration, as well as technical processes, among this Athapascan group. It has been mentioned before that we have here an example of acculturation through women of an art created by the conservative sex. If a number of Hupa men of Athapascan stock broke into this area and took to themselves wives of the country the weaving processes would not be changed, so that in any one of these baskets will be found, beginning at the bottom, three-strand twined weaving; above that two-strand plain-twined weaving, and over the surface decoration in overlaying. On the granary baskets the triangular and rectangular clementary forms are worked into vertical stripes, the basis of which is the bent line, or zigzag, forming the ornamentation, the leaves of grass alternate with the foundation color by laying a strip of the former on the latter and exposing it or turning it under at will. Dr. Goddard, in his paper published by the University of California, gives the following symbolism:
The isosceles triangle the Hupa calls ‘‘rattlesnake’s nose’’ (Luwminchwiw); right-angled triangles made with a horizontal line meeting a vertical line are called “sharp and slanting’? (chesLinalwiltchwel). Oblique-angled parallelograms are very frequently used. The name given them is ‘‘ set on top of one another’’ (niLkutdasaan). Another design, which lacks beauty on account of its jagged appearance, is called ‘‘grizzly bear his hand’’ (mikyowe mila). Another figure is called ‘‘frog his hand” (tewal mila). <A third design has angles projecting upward with the vertical lines on the outside of the figure and the oblique lines sloping inward and downward. This pattern is called ‘‘swallow’s tail’? (teschechmikye) or ‘‘points sticking up’’ (chaxcheufieL).
When the isosceles triangles (called Luwminchwuw) are grouped one above another they are called Luwminchwuw nikutdasaan (‘‘snake’s nose piled up’’). When these figures come back to back so as to form diamonds alternating with the background they are called Lokyomenkonte ( ‘‘sturgeon’s back’’). When the figure apex is superimposed on a trapezoid the name cha is given to the design. These figures are nearly always so connected as to encircle the basket, when the name LenaLdauw is given to it, signifying ‘‘it encircles.’? A design which seems to be the trapezoids superimposed is called LekyuwineL (‘‘they come together’’). The conception of the design seems to be that of the second variety of triangles back to back. A series of rectangular parallelograms superimposed so that each higher one projects to the right of the one below it, the whole being bordered by a double line conforming to the outline, is called kowitselminat (‘‘worm goes round’’ or ‘‘worm’s stairway’’). The oblique-angled parallelograms in pairs, with the upper one at the right, are the designs most frequently found on the hats. They are found in series on the storage baskets (djelo). Usually even numbers are employed, preserving the symmetry of the zone. Designs in red often have horizontal lines in black. Oblique lines in white often run across the design. When such lines run through the oblique-angled parallelogram they are called niLkutdasaan mikiteweso (‘fone-on-the-other its scratches”’ ).
Plate 171 represents a basketmaker from the Hupa Reservation in northern California, wearing one of the beautiful twined basket hats,

so called among this tribe. She also has about her, as a garment, a deerskin decorated with long fringes of false braided work in straw, the work done in a single strand. This photograph was taken by Governor John Daggett, of Black Bear, California.
Plate 172 is a portrait of Mary or Sheretta, a Klamath Indian woman, using different forms of basketry in the milling and cooking industry. Acorns are picked ina gathering basket, brought home ina varrying basket, ground in a mill with a basket hopper, the bitterness leeched out of the acorn mill fixed in a bed of sand, dipped with a basket ladle into a basket where it is cooked by means of hot stones, and afterwards served in dishes of basketry. This was also photographed by Governor Daggett.
The lower figure is a Wintun woman on McCloud River, in northern California, making a basket. The utter wretchedness and lack of inspiration from the environment could not possibly be worse. ‘The Wintuns belong to the Copehan family.
From Governor Daggett comes the information that the California Indians about him make the frame of the coiled baskets of hazel twigs skinned. The weaving is done with split pine root. The ornamental patterns are produced by sour grass and maidenhair fern. The white splint is dyed by being chewed in the woman’s mouth together with alder bark, making a kind of animated vat of herself. For the conical carrying basket, the Hupa Indian name is As tim num. Papoose basket, locks too; soup cooking basket, sal am poki; soup eating basket, pas tarrum; large storehouse, sip nook; cover to same, ash roos; mortar basket with hole in bottom, kraam num; acorn sifter, a flat disk, ten na bra; acorn bowl, moo roch.
South of the Hupa Indians is the Round Valley Reservation with the following-named tribes: Concow (Pujunan); Little Lakes (Kulanapan); Redwoods and Yukies (Yukian); Wailakis (Athapascan); Pit Rivers (Palaihnahan), and the Nomelakis (Copehan or Wintun family). A moment’s thought will show why it is that varieties in basket types come from this reservation. The Indian tribes of the neighborhood are mixed with those of the Sacramento Valley and Maidu or Pujunan people east of the Sierras. With biological mixture there has been corresponding fertilization of ideas.
N. J. Purcell, for a long time agent among the Round Valley Indians, describes the gathering basket as coarse meshed and roughly constructed. He has sent to the National Museum an example made by the Little Lake tribe. It is woven of sticks with the bark on, and is very quickly made. It has a buckskin string attached about the center, by which it is carried. It is used for gathering acorns, nuts, grain, etc. When filled, this basket is emptied into a large carrying basket, this being repeated until the larger basket is filled.
The large carrying basket is always put in some convenient place

<<<Page: 481>>>

and a smaller one is used for picking of nuts or grain. Several of the other tribes there use the same basket, though it seems to have originated among the Little Lake Indians. The willow of which it is composed is of the ordinary kind which is seen along nearly all the creeks in the East and is equally as plentiful here.
The sticks are generally used while green, though they are frequently gathered in quantities, allowed to dry, then soaked in water as they are required for use.
The carrying sack is made like an ordinary hunting bag and about
the size. It is manufactured by the Concow Indians only. The buckskin string attached is thrown across the shoulder, allowing the sack to swing by the side, as we carry the hunting bag. The material of which it is made is from a weed-like plant that grows from 3 to 5 feet high, found in but one place in this country. At the foot of the Black Butte, about 7,000 feet above sea level, it grows in great quantities. This plant, bo-coak, bears a large white flower, which is filled — with seed and has quite an agreeable odor. The leaves are large and long, tapering at the points. In winter the stalks die and become hard and dry, and are gathered in great quantities by the Indians. The bark is carefully taken off and the material from which the twine is made is stripped from the inside of the bark. This flax-like material is as white as cotton and seems much superior in strength. In making his twine the Indian seats himself, after first removing his trousers, takes enough of this flax to twist into about the size of No. 10 cotton in his left hand, lays it across the fleshy part of bis right leg, licks the palm of his right hand, places it upon the flax and twists it. In this
yay they make twine of all sizes, from that of the coarse sewing thread to that of a half-inch rope.
In early times all the sewing they did was with this thread, using a sharpened bone for a needle. The larger size twine was for making fish nets, bird nets, carrying sacks, snaring deer, ete.
The mortar basket is used for pounding acorns, grain, all kinds of nuts and seeds. It is made of tough roots of the fir, which are usually gathered in spring or winter, when the ground is soft. Roots of the small saplings are preferred, being tougher than those of the old tree. The size of the roots gathered varies from one-half to 1% inches. These are now buried under hot ashes and are allowed to remain thus for an hour. They are then taken out, not burned, but very hot. This steaming process toughens them and makes them split more easily, besides seasoning them to some extent. The squaw now takes this hot root in both hands, seizes it near the end with her front teeth, throws her head back and her hands forward, and the root is split exactly in the center in less than half a minute.
The two halves are again split in like manner and so on until the
pieces become about twice as large as required. The craftswoman is

<<<Page: 482>>>

now more careful, and the last piece is sometimes started with a sharp rock or knife, but usually with the teeth. One end of the splint is caught in the right hand, the other being kept between the teeth. The thumb and forefinger of the left hand are clinched tightly on the stick below the mouth. The head and right hand are now pulled slowly from each other. As the operation proceeds the finger and thumb of the left hand are slowly slipped down in front of the split part. Thus this last piece is divided accurately in the middle. The splints are not used at once, but are tied up in large circular coils and allowed to season, which, however, does not take long, as they are thin and the heating process aids in seasoning them very quickly. Being now prepared to make a basket, the woman uncoils the splints and throws them into a pan or basket of water, which renders them pliable and easy to be worked. The ribs of the basket are willow switches with the bark scraped off. In beginning the basket two of the splints are taken from the water and attached to one of the ribs with a kind of wrapped knot, so fastened as to allow one splint to stand toward the weaver and one directly from her. Another rib is now set close to the first one, and the splints are reversed; that is, the outside is pulled toward the weaver and the inside one is put from her; this forms a half turn around each side of a rib, the splints crossing or twining between the ribs. The same weave is used in the construction of the whole basket. Around the extreme top of this basket is a half-inch stick usually wrapped or stitched on with small vines split in the center. The dark red material used occasionally in this basket (Cere/s occidental’s) is found in the mountains and is an undergrowth never attaining a size larger than one’s ankle. The Indians call it ‘‘mo-lay.” It bears a red blossom and small slender switches grow up at the bottom of the larger bush which are of a dark red color. These are split open in the middle in the same way as the fir root, save that they are not heated. The stitches represent half the size of the stick, as it is split only once. The wood with bark off is snow white.
Mr. Purcell, in describing a pretty little basket of grass root covered with red feathers, made by the Little Lake Indians, says every mother in this tribe presents one of these baskets to her child when it is about 7 years of age with the admonition to take care of the gift. They have a superstition that if the basket is lost some evil will befall the child. It is impossible to obtain one of these from the Little Lakes, the specimen described having been secured in the Concow tribe.
Under the name of Pomo are included a great number of tribes or little bands, thirty, according to Hudson, Purdy, and Wileomb— sometimes one in a valley, sometimes more—clustered in the region where the headwaters of the Eel and Russian rivers interlace, along the latter and around the estuaries of the coast. In disposition the

<<<Page: 483>>>

Pomo are quite different from the Yuki and their congeners, being simple, friendly, peaceable, and inoffensive. They are also much less cunning and avaricious and less quickly imitative of the whites than the lively tribes on the Klamath, to whom they are inferior in intellect. As to their physique, there prevails on the Russian River essentially the same types as that seen in the Sacramento Valley. When first occupied by the European, the valleys inhabited by the Pomo teemed with wild grasses and the streams were hedged in with carex and willow. The native grasses have almost disappeared, while the carices have given place in the lowlands to hops and alfalfa. Many ranchers forbid an Indian to dig on their lands, thus limiting the weaving-material supply to outlying canyons or compelling a substitution of inferior material. Sometimes an indifferent worker will use but one character of material in a basket; for instance, the redbud shoots for warp and the two contrasting sides of the cortex for pattern. This method, called bi-to’-i, effects looseness of weft and warp, incongruity of colors, and instability of the vessel, and is strongly condemned by an expert. Some weavers will conscientiously refuse to work rather than substitute hai (woody material) for ma-yem/ (roots). The following notes by J. W. Hudson accompanied his collection to the National Museum:

Plate 173 illustrates a coiled basket of the Pomo Indians ieft unfinished to show the workmanship. The foundation is in the style called Tee weaving, twined work, described and illustrated on page 239 and in fig. 27. These structural features are clearly set forth in the plate. In the foreground the vertical and the horizontal warp, as well as the twined weft, appear in their true association. The body sewing is done with white splints of mu 1lé or redbud (Cercis occidentalis); the figures, representing mountains, are wrought with brown splints of cercis. It is 10 inches in diameter, collected by Dr. J. W. Hudson, and is Catalogue No. 200013 in the U. 5S. National Museum.
In feather work, each feather is plucked from the prepared skin of the bird and neatly caught under a stitch, which is then drawn tight. They are used either to heighten the color without aiding the design or the design is in the feathers and not in the stitches. For the former quail plumes and the red feathers from the woodpecker’s head are employed. The red feathers are placed regularly but thinly on the stitches of the upper half of the basket and the quail plumes scattered, or below three rows of shell disks (kaia) on the upper edge of the basket. In the feather basket proper there are two varieties called ‘*tapica” and ‘‘epica.” The tapica is the so-called sun basket; but Purdy insists that the word means ‘‘red basket.” The oldest specimens are saucer-shaped baskets, covered with red feathers, decorated with pendants of kaia and abalone, with circles of shell money. The use of other feathers than red is a charming innovation. The Ballo kai Pomo name for feather baskets in any other shape is ‘‘epica.” When the Pomo use shell disks (kaia) to decorate coiled basketry, a thread is carried along under the stitches and the disks threaded on as needed. Beads are usually applied in the same way, but in some examples they are threaded on the sewing filaments. (Carl Purdy.)
There is no more interesting group of Indians in America than the Pomo with respect to the variety of technical processes in basketry. They not only understand many of the processes common among other tribes, but have introduced one or two types of manipulation peculiar to themselves. The following classification, prepared by J. W. Hudson and Carl Purdy, shows the variety of basket work made by them:
.. Pshukan (Shakan, Purdy), coarse twined work of shuba or hazel. 2. Pshutsin, wrapped weft, happily called backstitching by Hudson. 3. Bamtush, plain twined weaving.
4. Shuset, twine over two warp rods, diagonal.
5. Sheetsin, three-strand braid or twine.
6. Lit, Makah style, wrapped weft twined (figs. 20, 21).
7. Tee, twined weaving over lattice foundation.

<<<Page: 486>>>

Or oO
8. Shailo, foundation of splints (Shailo, Purdy). 9. Tsai, foundation of one rod.
10. Baumko, two-stem foundation laid vertically.
11. Bamshibu, foundation of 3 rods.
12. Bamteck, four-stem foundation.
13. Tsawam, the half-hitch work on cradles.
Purdy adds ringed and sewed; each circle of foundation complete. These names are from Yokaia, Upper Yokaia, Calpella, and Potter Valley. The word for basket in Potter is Pika; at Upper Lake, Sitol; at Lower Lake, Kolob; at Cache Creek, Kawah.
1. Pshti-kin’ (fish weir) in its simplest form is the binding of a row of upright warp rods by means of pairs of hazel or willow shoots passing them horizontally with a half twist in each space. Undressed material is the rule, but in more delicate household vessels the willow is decorticated, even polished. Hazel (Shu ba, the fisherman) was the original material. It is nothing more than a very coarse open twined work, passing now and then into three-strand twine. (See fig. 20.)
2, Pshutsin, a very substantial means of framing a large, heavy structure, such as granaries, sheathing for thatch, game fences, ete. It is in effect wrapped twined weaving, seen also in Mohave carrying frames. From the periphery a strand of grapevine loosely encircles two ribs, passing to the left over four ribs, then backward, catching two or more and repeating gradually, back two, forward four, inward to the center or apex. <A second vine catches a rib at the bottom of the roof passing to the left over four ribs, encircling two, thence zigzags parallel with No. 1 to the top. This is repeated till spaces are covered. Pshutsin effects in house building a coarse mesh at the foundation, but gradually closed in at the apex, where most needed. In granaries the conditions are reversed, but the effect is the same. Fences require an additional top vine. (See fig. 13.)
3. Bamtush (Bamtu, grapevine) plain twined weaving. Pattern and wsthetic art were here born, the brown bark of the vine contrasting with pale yellow of the inner vine splittings. The grape has long since been discarded for stronger and more polished material. Bamtush is the strongest weave and is used in carrying baskets, acorn baskets, and very large, heavy mush baskets. There is a warp of willow or other stems radiating from the bottom. On this the warp is laid in pairs, the two splints being twisted a half time in passing a warp stem. The effect is that of ribbed cloth or corduroy. The ornamentation is usually in bands. (See fig. 15.)
4. Shuset is twining over two warps and alternating from round to round and affords the ampiest opportunity for artistic display. It is called diagonal or twilled-twined work, as its surface is the smoothest

<<<Page: 487>>>

of Pomo weaves; the patterns are bold and clear and cover the whole area. It is the only weave whose pattern is not woven through. It has also the mode of delicate structure. It is used in large acorn baskets, also in mush baskets, being strong, smooth, and moderately close. Some fine gift baskets are also in this weave, and it seems to be susceptible of much more elaborate ornamentation than the plain twined work. The word Shuset, says Hudson, is understood only as far south as Ukiah City, the Yokaia term for diagonal twine being Bam tsai. (See fig. 20.)
5. Sheetsin is a style of three-strand twined weaving in which at each third of a turn one weft filament is carried behind a warp stem. It will be seen at once that when the bundle of weft filaments has made a whole revolution, each one of them will have been carried behind the warp. On the inside this basketry does not differ in appearance from common twined weaving, but on the outside each weft element passes over three warp stems and under one.
There is a peculiar type of Sheetsin used chiefly to start the foundations of twined baskets. It is a three-strand weft in which a braid is formed instead of a twine, one of its elements passing over each warp, the other two remaining outside. On the inside the effect is of plain twined weaving, while on the outside the effect is diagonal. (See fig. 28.)
6. Lit is a style of twined weaving in which one of the elements remains on the inside of the basket and the other is wrapped around the checks formed by the crossing of this horizontal element with the vertical warps. The Makah Indians, of Cape Flattery, employ this technic almost exclusively, but Hudson says the Kulanapan tribes used it only to give variety to a surface in which plain twine and Shuset are used. On the same authority, this word Lit is known among all the Pomo tribes, even among the Tsawalu Pomo, near Guernerville. (See figs. 21, 22.)
7. Tee (intricate) is a double structure, a Bamtush reinforced by horizontal warp across the outside of the vertical. On the inside this ware is undistinguishable from plain twined work. Its characteristics are great strength, the closest mesh, and a pattern dim and impressional. It is the most difficult and highest priced of the Tshama weaves. The openwork basket trays in tee weave are called by Dr. Hudson psher kom, or fish plate. (See fig. 27.)
The name Shi bu, or Tschibu, applies, says Purdy, in reality to only the three-stick coiled baskets. The full name is Bam shi bu, or Bamsibu, sticks three. No branch of the Pomo use it except for threestick baskets and only the Calpella, Kalshe, and Ballo bai Pomo use it at allasa basket name. One-stick baskets in Calpella, Kalshe, and Ballo bai Pomo are bam cha, stick one, or tishais. The filaments of Pomo Shibu coiled basketry are shaved down to uniform width and thickness with the greatest care. :

<<<Page: 488>>>

8. Shailo, suggested by the spiral rib of Tee, was constructed of a spiral coil of fir-root fibers bound to its adjacent coil below by a single strand of the same material catching in the lower coil fibers or the tops of its lacings. This method, the Protean Shibu, developed and considered by other California Indians, notably Yokut, as the acme of art, has long since been discarded by the Pomo as inadequate to the demands of even close weaving and pattern. However, it proved the coil to be practicable and from it evolved Tsai.
9. In the Tsai (bam-cha, one rib) or single-rod coiled basketry the foundation is a single willow shoot of uniform thickness throughout, seasoned and smoothed, spiraling from base to rim and sewed down with narrow splints of various materials. Two rods are inclosed in each stitch which passes beneath the rib of the previous turn, the stitches interlocking. This structure is quite light and elegant, permitting the most delicate treatment, both in stitch and pattern. Spectmens frequently average 60 stitches to the linear inch. (See fig. 46.)
10. Baumko is the Pomo name for coiled basketry on a foundation of two stems, one above the other. It is an economical method of work, for it widens the coil and to that extent diminishes the amount of sewing. (See fig. 47.)
11. Bamshibu or bamtsuwu (tsu-ba, three) consists of a three-rod warp or coil bound down by its lacings, catching in the lacings and one stem of the next lower coil. This is justly regarded by the Pomo as the highest type of basket art. Its materials require the most careful tests of evenness, pliability, and color. The legitimate function of treble ribs besides solidity is its adaptability for retaining the bulbs of feathers, and was doubtless created by an incentive for this rich ornamentation. Comparison with other styles of work reveals the fact that by reason of fine material and pressing together of the stitches the sewing conceals the foundation, while in the varieties before mentioned the latter is visible between the stitches. (See fig. 50.)
12. Bamteck is scarcely to be looked upon as a separate style of weaving. It is simply a variety of No. 11. The manipulation of the stitches is precisely the same in both.
13. Tsawam. This is an application of the backward and forward braiding or false braiding found on the margins of many baskets and described in the proper place in this work. The rods of the cradle are held together by a coarse cotton string obtained from the traders, formerly, no doubt, made of splint. Carried across the warp rods the weft material passes forward four, backward two, right; forward four, backward two, left—and so, alternately backward to the right or left, forms a very neat braid on one side of the basket, and what looks like two rows of twined weaving on the other.
The making of a fine coiled basket requires an infinite amount of patience. The rootstocks carefully gathered during the summer and

<<<Page: 489>>>

early autumn are split into fine strands for direct use. At Round Valley the process is as follows: The rootstocks, denuded of their outer coverings, are thoroughly soaked in warm water, and one end of a root is divided through the center, by means of the finger nails, into three parts. One of these parts is held firmly between the teeth, while, by means of the fingers, the whole root is carefully and very evenly split into three sections. Each of these sections is again separated into three parts in the same manner, and the same process is carried out until the strands are as fine as may be desired, the value of the basket

depending in great measure upon the fineness of the strands used as well as the general beauty of the finished fabric. These strands are used not like those from the pine root in twined work, but for thread for sewing coiled ware. In beginning the basket, three very pliant stems are so selected that when placed together their combined cross sections will be nearly circular. The use of three ‘‘ sticks” instead of one, as is sometimes the case in less costly baskets, gives much more elasticity and greater strength to the basket. The strand is wrapped tightly about one end of the compound withe, and as the wrapping Ke

progresses, the wand is bent into a minute circle; the central hole is filled in by stitching over and over again, and with this as a basis the little plaque is gradually built up by coiling. The general shape and plan of the basket must necessarily be carried in mind, for there is no skeleton to serve as a guide. Infinite care must therefore be exercised, not only in preserving the symmetry of shape, but also the symmetry of the designs which are worked in with the black and white strands. It requires many months, sometimes years, of leisure work to complete a first-class basket. Some of the very best are more or less individual in their shape and pattern. (Chesnut.)

Fig. 165 is a coiled basket of the Pomo Indians (Kulanapan family) in a style of sewing called Bamshibu. The foundation consists of three stems or rods. The stitches pass over the foundation and interlock with those underneath, giving a ribbed appearance to the fabric. This tiny object is a little over one-half an inch in diameter and passes easily through a lady’s finger ring. In the foundation, the uniform width of the coil and of the stitches, and the neatness of the sewing, it would be difficult to find a more charming piece of Indian handiwork.

stitches passing both over the rod of the course in progress and under the rod of the foundation of the course beneath. These small pieces represent fairly the best Pomo workmanship.
These two baskets are in the collection of C. P. Wilecomb, curator of the Golden Gate Park Museum, San Francisco, California, and were made under his supervision.
Fig. 167 is a coiled basket of the Hoochnom Indians, Yukian family. It is made in a style of coiled weaving called rod and welt. In this method one or two small rods or stems of uniform thickness constitute the body or foundation of the coil. Over this is laid a thin filament or strip of material, and the stitches of each coil pass over the foundation, under the splint, and interlock. The work of the Hoochnom Indians is of excellent character, the coils about the same width of the number of stitches to the inch, uniform. In the example

<<<Page: 491>>>

here shown the coils are one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and there are twenty stitches to the inch. The ornamentation appears to be the usual California combination of mountain and coil plume. The use of light and dark filaments and the alternation of triangles and rectangles on the two sides of the open space form a very attractive ornament. The use of shell disks improves the appearance of the object. Feathers are also employed on some specimens from this locality.
A square inch shown in fig. 168 illustrates more definitely the description here given.
This specimen, Catalogue No. 21371 in the U.S. National Museum, was procured in Eel River, California, by Stephen Powers.

The Klamath Indians have their home upon the Little and Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Marsh, and Sprague River, Oregon. Their name in their own language is E-ukshikni (Klamath Lake people). The Modoc are termed by the Klamath J/odoknz (southern people).?
Fig. 169 is a twined flexible basket of the Klamath Indians. The body is in plain twined weaving; the three elevated bands on the outside are in three-ply twined weaving, the effect being that of hoops placed on wooden vessels for the purpose of strengthening them and is very pleasing. By choosing straws or stems of different plants for these three-ply bands the artistic impression is heightened. By twining dark and light colored straws in the texture and by varying the number of monochrome or dichrome twines, charming effects in endless variety may be produced.

A square inch shown in fig. 170 makes clear the manner in which the plain twined and three-ply twine may be combined and also that of using different colored materials. The rows in both cases, however, are monochrome. If the alternate meshes were dark and light, the beauty would be enhanced. The using of dichrome twine is rather limited to this particular area—northern California and southernOregon.

Plate 174 represents two Klamath Indian baskets in the collection of Dr. C. Hart Merriam. The interesting feature in them is that the entire structure is in three-strand twined work. The border resembles closely one of the simplest among the Tlinkits, namely, the warp strands are turned down and held in place by a row of twined weaving. All the Indians of this area practice the three-strand work, but do not cover the whole basket with it. This weave is reserved for strengthening weak places and for ornament. It has the disadvantage of being wasteful of material.
South of the Klamath and Modoe tribes and closely associated with them live the Shasta Indians (Sastean family, formerly on the Klamath River from Bogus Creek to Scott Z River; on the Shasta River, Little Saath | a : Shasta and Yuka Creek; and in Scott § Valley, to which has been added the Upper Salmon and a part of Rogue River in Oregon). Stephen Powers commends the strength and beauty of the Shasta women. With their basket hats fitting tight on their round heads and walking with a grenadier stride, they present quite an Amazonian appearance.“ The specimens of Shasta Indian baskets in the U.S. National Museum are not to be distinguished fundamentally from those just described. They are in twined weaving with overlaying in straw. Their special marks are in the designs or symbols.’
Plate 175, top figure, represents a twined basket of the Pit River Indians, Copehan family, in Shasta County, California. In Dixon’s paper precisely the same symbols are seen on a basket labeled Yanan (Plate 25). The warp and weft on the bottom are of some kind of rush. The weft on the body is in stems of the squaw grass. There are twelve twists and twenty rows of twined weaving to the inch. The color of the body is a beautiful old gold produced by age. The ornamentation is in three sets of three rhombs, each done in black material, perhaps fern stems. Crosses and diamond patterns are SEO ws to

The middle figure is said to have been made by the Pit River Indians, the warp and bottom being in soft rushes. The weft of the body is in strips of rushes over which thin filaments of squaw grass have been wound. The delicate figures are in black fern stems. Design, lizard’s feet, three in number, with festoons of short lines between. The border is formed by braiding down the ends of the warp and holding them in place by a row of twined weaving. This is a very common method of treatment throughout this country. Its height is 3 inches and diameter 54 inches. Catalogue No. 204910, U.S. National Museum. Collected by Harry F. Liston.
The lower figure represents a basket from the McCloud River Indians, Copehan family. The warp is in small rods, perhaps of hazel. The weft in twisted root of dark brown color. The first few rows of twining, and here and there another row around the bottom, are in three-strand, the rest in double twining. The body is in the same brown material wrapped with squaw grass, the figures showing on both sides. The ornamentation consists of four rows of double rhombs in black fern and one single row. Around the bottom is a double row in two colors. The border is finished in one row of three-strand twine weaving, the ends of the warp showing. Its height is 43 inches and its diameter 5 inches. Catalogue No. 19349, U. 5. National Museum. Collected by Livingston Stone.
Fig. 171 isa carrying basket of the McCloud River Indians, Copehan family. The tribes of this family are described by Powers under the general name of Wintun, Those living on the McCloud Fork are named Winnimin, the meaning of which term is North River. The similarity of the McCloud River basketry with that of the Pit River people will be apparent. The technic, poorly shown, is in twined weaving with a foundation of stems. The noticeable feature is the overlaying of the filaments with grass stems or fern stems to produce the ornamentation. The strength of the basket is in the weaving. The bottom is cup-shaped, and for 3 or 4 inches is in three-strand twined weaving. The rest of the workmanship is in the ordinary two-strand twine. In order to strengthen the basket a coil of rods is sewed around the bottom for about a foot. The border is a strong hoop attached to the warp stems by bending down the latter and sewing them in place with splints, forming a single row of coiled work. The overlaying passes to the inside, so that the figures are the same without and within the basket. On the body the rhomboid figures forming triangular ornaments are named in Mr. Dixon’s paper ‘leaves strung along.”

The upper figure is an example of two-colored design in plain twined weaving by simply hiding every alternate twist of the weft strands.

fornia. They belong to the Palaihnihan family, which Mr. Gatschet believes to be related to the Sastean or Shasta tribes. Dixon (1902) places the basketry of these tribes in his northeastern group of California tribes associated with the Klamath and Modoc (Lutuamian), Shastas (Sastean, but probably Palaihnihan), Pit Rivers (Palaihnihan), Yana (Yanan), Wintun (Copehan), and Maidu (Pujunan). Powers“ characterizes the Hat Creek Indians as the most warlike in all the Pit River Basin, and the one most dreaded by the timid aborigines of the Sacramento Valley. These specimens are in the collection of H. E, Williams.

<<<Page: 496>>>

The eastern portion of northern California, as before mentioned, is largely divided between the Palaihnihan, Yanan, and Pujunan linguistic families. It might be easily supposed by one who had no knowledge on the subject whatever, that the coiled basketry of the interior basin would obtrude itself here and either push backward the tribes making twined work, or at least the latter would be forced to a very subordinate position. Dr. Roland B. Dixon has published in the American Anthropologist, but more extensively in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History,” the result of accurate studies in the basketry of the eastern tribes. The most extensive researches of Dr. Dixon are on the basketry of the Maidu Indians described by Powers. On Powell’s linguistic map these Indians are assigned to the Pujunan family. Their country lies east of the Sacramento River and extends as far as the Nevada line, stretching north and south from the southern line of Lassen and Tehama counties to the Consumne River. A number of examples of Maidu basketry have already been described, and illustrated in Plates 56 and 57. The specimens are in the U. 8. National Museum.
The body is either in splints of willow or other wood and a species of root. At the time of this writing Mr. Coville was not quite sure as to the species employed. The designs on the body of the basket are in the splints of Cerces occidentalis, the bark and young shoots remaining in place. An inspection of a number of Maidu baskets together leaves the impression of distinct individuality. They belong to the three-rod variety of coiled weaving and the sewing passes over the foundation, under one of the rods of the foundation beneath, the stitches interlocking. Frequently on the inside they split, which enables the sewer to give each stitch on the outer surface a vertical position. The material used in the sewing is hard and is not driven tight home, each stitch being wide below and narrow above. After a study of one of these specimens, its colors and patterns, the investigator will have no trouble afterwards in identifying a Maidu basket.
Dr. Dixon, who has given most attention to the lore in Maidu haskets, divides the symbols into three classes, namely: Natural designs, plant designs, and those representing natural or artificial objects. His plates | to 17 are devoted exclusively to Maidu basketry. Among them will be seen a few in twined weaving, principally conical burden baskets. A comparison of these among themselves and also those of the Pit River Indians and tribes living in the Sacramento Valley indirate acculturation of some kind, borrowing ideas, or may be women, ideas and all. A number of Maidu baskets in the U. S. National Museum were collected by W. H. Holmes.
A suggestion might be made in this connection that the so-called

feather design on the Dixon baskets“ may be those on arrows, which in some California tribes are notched. ‘This is only a suggestion. One of Dixon’s most intricate feather patterns has narrow lines between, resembling the letter H, which might be either the rib of the feathers or the owner’s mark on the shaftment of the arrow. The association of this notched half feather design with the symbol for arrow points would be in harmony with this view. No other artificial object enters so profoundly into Indian art, gaming, lore, and ceremony.
On the map of California, covering a small spot at the angle of the eastern border, are the Washoe Indians (Washoan family). They extend into the parts of Nevada adjoining, occupying the mountain region in the extreme western portion of the State about Washoe and Tahoe lakes and the towns of Carson and Virginia City. They formerly extended farther east and south, but were driven back by the Paiute, who conquered them and reduced them to complete subjection. Their basketry is the same general type as the Maidu, just north, but in execution it is far above. The material is willow, Datill-yah-wee; the brown or reddish tint is that of the bark of mountain birch (Cercis occidentalis), Et-ba-sha, and the black is from the root of a mountain brake (Pteridium aquilinum), mes-a-weg-a-see, all of lasting quality, and they acquire with age a richness that makes them incomparable. The sewing is faultless. Stitch after stitch, over and over, increases in width and length with the swelling and shrinking of the basket like a harmony in music. The form of the specimen is charming, and the ornamentation ideal. The recognition of worth in the Washoe basketmaker is encouraging, for the price of a few pieces reaches into the thousands of dollars. The author heartily acknowledges the aid of Mrs. A. Cohn, of Carson City, Nevada, for information about the Washoes and for photographs.
The tiny Washoe offering or gift basket (Sing-aru-mi), when used to propitiate the harvest spirit, is filled with choicest grain or seeds or acorns from the last crop to insure a future good harvest. One or two of the large storing or household baskets (Da-gee-coop) will hold the winter supply of grain or nuts. The flat cradles (Bicose-modimi-odi) are for the papooses (now-gung). If the child’s father is a famous brave or chief, the basket is covered with buckskin and gaily decorated with beads, trinkets, tasseled fringes, or feathers. The ornamentation of the little sheltering cover for the head tells the sex of the occupant.?
Plate 179 represents three basket bowls in the U. 8. National Museum labeled Washoe. They all show the characteristics of uniformity and plain ornamentation referred to. The lowest in the series has also a margin of feather work which allies it with the type of the

tribes farther west. Catalogue Nos. 204846, 86244, 35435, U.S. National Museum.
Plate 180 is one of the best specimens in Mrs. A. Cohn’s collection in Carson City, Nevada. The symbol on the surface is a collection of points meaning ‘‘clear skies, good weather.” Mrs. Cohn finds variations in these, the number of points ranging from three to seven. In some examples they are contiguous; in others separated by narrow spaces.
Plate 181 is a picture of Datsolallee, the maker of the finest specimens of Washoe basketry. She is holding in her left hand the bowed stick in shape of a racquet, with which hot stones are taken from the fire to be placed in the basket of mush in order to cook it. The symbols shown on the various baskets at her feet represent men, women, snakes, arrows, wind, weather symptoms, morning, and migrating.
Plate 182, upper figure, shows a basket bowl of the Washoe Indians, collected by Eugene Mead. The foundation is the three-rod style in willow. The sewing is done in splints of the same material. The ornamentation on the bottom is a many pointed star in brown cercis. On the body there are three circles made up of isosceles triangles in the same. Two of the rows on the body of the basket are so arranged as to have a narrow belt of white between them, the points of one being downward and the other upward. This form of ornamentation is suggestive of the patterns on the sewed coils of the Navaho basket bowls. The border is plain coiled sewing. Its diameter is 8$ inches, and height 34 inches.
Plate 182, lower figure, is a basket bowl, Catalogue No. 204852, U.S. National Museum, coiled work from Inyo County, California, tribe not positively known. There are four sets of ornamentation on the side in step pattern in threes, done in sewing splints dyed black. The most interesting feature of the basket is the border, which is in false braid, made of a single splint wrapped over the upper foundation, forward, under, and back, over again and down beneath the two foundation rows, making a figure 8.
The southern portion of the Oregon-California basket area is bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and there was little encouragement to venture beyond the shore line except in San Francisco Bay and around the Santa Barbara Islands. On the north of it are the Maidu, Copehan, and the Yukian families. On the south and forming a part of the subarea itself are the Missions, some of which belong to the Yuman family, the southern boundary of the area. The great Shoshonean family has pushed across the drainage of the interior basin to the coast at Santa Barbara. This southern region is a long rectangle inclined toward the west. Its axis would be a meridian through diagonal corners. The eastern portion is Shoshonean terri

tory. The western portion belongs to the following linguistic families: Moquelumnan, Costanoan, Mariposan, Esselenan, Salinan, and Chumashan. Along the median line of this subarea are Mono, Fresno, Inyo, Tulare, and Kern counties—another basketry Caucasus or Babel. (See fig. 163.)
Those who have made collections from this part of California will bear witness that the exchanging of baskets and of women who make baskets from stock to stock has rendered it almost impossible to identify forms ethnically. Here blood and speech and industry are apt to be confounded. At least, it is too early in the investigation to be positive on the subject.
Another difficulty arises in this study from the fact that language’ groups, tribal names, and county names are also mixed up. For instance, a basket may be called Tulare because it was purchased in that county of California, haying no reference to the Indian tribe. <A specimen made by the same woman will bear the name of the tribe of which she isa member. Still another one of her productions might be called from the group of languages to which her own belongs. At present the confusion extends beyond form and design to the sub-
stances and technical processes. The author acknowledges his obligations to E. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield; C. P. Wilcomb, of Golden Gate Park Museum, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of Washington, for the information here given. Each of these has given most careful study to this cosmopolitan basket region. Dr. Merriam has devoted special attention to the plants used.¢
Of this ware Dr. Merriam says that most of the coiled baskets made by the Indians inhabiting the lower slopes of the Sierra from Fresno River south to the Kern are celebrated for excellence of workmanship, beauty of form, elegance of design, and richness of material, which differs in tone and texture from that used by the tribes north and south of the region indicated. When fresh, its color is brownish buff; with age it becomes darker and richer. By careful selection a handsome dappled effect is produced. It is made from the root of a marsh plant which the Indians traveled long distances to procure, identified by Miss Alice Eastwood, botanist of the California Academy of Seiences, as Cladium mariscus. The foundation consists of a bundle of stems of a yellow grass, Lpicampes rigens. The black in the design is the root of the ‘* bracken” or ‘* brake fern,” Pfertdium aquilinum. The red is usually split branches of the redbud, Cercis occidentalis, with the bark on, gathered after the fall rains, when the bark is red. The tribes making the Cladium baskets are the Nims, Chukchancys, Cocahebas, Wuksaches, Wiktchumnes, Tulares, and perhaps one or

two others. Besides these, the root is sometimes used by certain squaws of the Mewah tribe living north of the Fresno and by the Pakanepull and Newooah tribes living south of the Kern; but among these its use is exceptional.
Another material which has proved a stumbling-block to collectors is the red of the design in the handsome baskets made by the Kern Valley, Newooah, and Panamint Shoshone Indians. This material is often called cactus root. It is the unpeeled root of the tree yucca (Yucca arborescens), Which grows in the higher parts of the Mohave Desert, pushes over Walker Pass, and reaches down into the upper part of the valley of South Fork of Kern. The so-called Tejon Indians obtain it in Antelope Valley, at the extreme west end of the Mohave Desert. The yucea root varies considerably in depth of color, so that by careful selection some of the Indian women produce beautiful shaded effects and definite pattern contrasts.
Some of the Panamint Shoshones inhabiting the desolate desert region between Owens Lake and Death Valley use, either in combination with the yucca root or independently, the bright-red shafts of the wing and tail feathers of a woodpecker—the red-shafted flicker, Colaptes cafer collaris. These same Indians use two widely different materials for their black designs—the split seed pods of the devil’s horn, Martynia, and the root of a marsh bulrush, Se/rpus. The Martynia is a relatively coarse material, and when properly selected yields a dead black. The Sc¢rpus root is a fine, delicate material, which, by burying in wet ashes, is made to assume several shades or tones, from blackish brown to purplish black, or even lustrous. black.
In parts of the Colorado Desert in southeastern California the Coahuilla Indians use split strands from the leaf of the desert palm (Veowashingtonia plamentosa) as a surface material for their coiled baskets. The design is usually black or orange-brown, and is a rush (-/uneus).”
The following list gives the families of the tribes in Tulare, Kern, and Inyo counties, using the plants named in the first part of this description: 1. Chukchan cys Chukchan si (Mariposan); 2. Cocahebas; 3. Mewah (Moquelumnan); +4. Newooah; 5. Nims; 6. Pakanepull; 7. Tulares (part of Olamentke diy., Moquelumnan); 8. Wiktchumnes, Wikchumni (Mariposan); 9. Wuksaches, Wiksachi (Mariposan).
The elements of ornamentation are lines direct and crooked, in shapes as varied as the margins of leaves, and they might without affectation receive the same names—dentate, serrate, sinuous, ete. These simple lines are combined in parallels, herring-bone, chevrons, crenellations, and many more patterns. The triangle, the rectangle, the rhomb, and the polygon are used in great variety. Out of these elements the designs on this basketry are separate, concentric, or radiate.
aC. Hart Merriam, Science, May 23, 1903.

<<<Page: 501>>>

The separate designs are, after all, subservient to the others. Very little of this ware shows entirely free and scattered patterns. The plume or L-shaped, the white and colored rectangles associated, the groups of marks on the border, and chiefly the rectangles in two colors with hourglass middle are most common.
Concentric designs are narrow or wide bands, whose middle portion is decorated with crooked lines and geometric figures in endless variety of combinations. Most of the bands have entire margins, but projecting margins are not unknown. The most noteworthy is Merriam’s ‘butterfly flight design.” (See Plate 194.)
The radial designs are straight or spiral. The composition of each ray is a study in itself. But a glance at a large number of baskets from this central region shows the predominance of the cuneate motive. These truncated wedges spring out of a central, circular pattern and widen toward the margin. Their surfaces and their margins are seldom entire. The spiral designs are also frequently wedgeshaped, but the manner of their composition is of the greatest interest. Lurking in them all is the stepped motive in which herringbone or jagged lines and simple geometric figures follow one another by echelon. This on a roundish surface gives spirals of any amount of curvature. By widening and lengthening the rectangular elements the wedgeshaped interspaces are filled with the spiral pattern and the whole surface is covered with a single design. This charming decoration is peculiar to the Santa Barbara baskets. (See Plate 49.) In outward form the baskets of the area here considered vary from round, flat gambling mats, through trays and bowls of various depths, and hats of conical shape, to narrow-mouthed vases, or ** bottle-necks” as they are called. Some of these are low and broad and closely resemble the best of ancient Arizona pottery.
The basketry of the Panamint Indians (Shoshonean) living in Death Valley, Inyo County, says Coville, is made by the squaws at the cost of a great deal of time, care, and skill. The materials are very simple. They consist of the year-old shoots of some species of tough willow, splints from Salix lasiandra, the year-old shoots of the aromatic sumac, Rhus trilobata, the long, black, slender, flexible horns on the mature pods of the unicorn plant, J/artynia louisiana, locally known as devil horns, and the long, red roots of the tree yucca, Yucca arborescens. These materials give three types of color—that of the willow and the sumac, the black of the devil horns, and the red of the yucca roots. This last material, although it has a strong fiber and a pretty red color, is rarely used, for it is too thick to pack closely and the resulting fabric is full of interstices.
Sumac and willow are prepared for use in the same way by the Panamint Indians. The bark is removed from the fresh shoots by biting it loose at the end and tearing it off. The woody portion is

<<<Page: 502>>>

scraped to remove bud protuberances and other inequalities of the surface and is then allowed to dry. These slender stems serve as foundation. The sewing material is prepared from the same plants. A squaw selects a fresh shoot, breaks off the too slender upper portion and bites one end so that it starts to split into three nearly equal parts. Holding one of these parts in her teeth and one in either hand, she pulls them apart, guiding the splitting with her fingers so dexterously that the whole shoot is divided into three equal even portions. Taking one of these, by a similar process she splits off the pith and the adjacent less flexible tissue from the inner face, and the bark from the outer, leaving a pliant, strong, flat strip of young willow or sumac wood. Both stems and splints may be dried and kept for months and probably even for several years, but before being used they are always soaked in water.
The pack baskets and some, at least, of the water baskets are made of these splints and rods in twined work. The women begin at the bottom with two layers of rods superimposed and fastened by their middles at right angles. The free ends are bent upward, and in and out between them the strands are woven, new warp rods being inserted as the basket widens. An attempt at ornamentation is frequently made by retaining the bark on some of the strands or by staining them and by slightly varying the weave. A squaw commonly occupies an entire month constructing one such basket.
Starting from a central point to make a coiled basket, a bundle of two or three grass stems and one very slender rod is wrapped with a willow splint. At the proper point the foundation is drawn more tightly, so that the remainder of the spiral forms the sides of the basket. The wall has the thickness, therefore, of one of these bundles, and is composed of a continuous ascending spiral. The willow rod furnishes a strong hold for the stitches, and the punctures are made with an iron awl. When such an instrument can not be obtained an admirable equivalent is substituted in the form of a stout, horny cactus spine from the devil’s pincushion, /chénocactus polycephalus, set in a head of hard pitch. The grass stems, when the stitches are drawn tightly, make a perfect packing, and the basket when finished is water tight.
The pack baskets of the Panamint Indians have the form of a funnel, from 1} to 25 feet high and not quite so broad. The loaded basket is held against the back between the shoulders, either by the hands grasping its rim, or by leather or rope throngs passed around the forehead, the body meanwhile bent forward.
The plaques are small, flat, circular pieces of closely sewed coiled work, usually 9 to 12 inches in diameter. They are flexible and sometimes slightly saucer-shaped, and are used not only as plates and pans, but also as substitutes for sieves. The material to be sifted, composed of ground seeds, is placed upon the plate and the chaff winnowed out.

<<<Page: 503>>>

The pot basket of the Panamints is in coiled work and has the shape of a rather deep bowl with curved sides and a deep bottom, and has a capacity of about 3 pints. The squaw uses it as a general measure, as a bowl for dry food and for soup, and often, when in the sunshine, as a hat. Most of their starchy food is roasted dry by mixing seeds, before they are ground, with hot coals and stirring them in the basket. This process is still largely used.
The water basket has a capacity of 2 or 3 gallons. Its outline is that of an urn with a narrow neck and a rounded, conical bottom. The entire inner surface, and frequently the outside, is coated with pitch. Woven into the shoulder of the basket on one side are two loops of horsehair, or other strong material, to which is attached a thong. In carrying, this thong is passed around the forehead, while the basket is rested on the back between the shoulders.
All the Shoshonean types of weaving, all their forms of baskets, and most of the patterns on them are ancient. The canyon walls of the upper tributaries of the Colorado are honeycombed with cliff and cave dwellings. From them came inexhaustible treasures of basket work.@
In the collection of Dr. C. Hart Merriam in Washington City there are most excellent examples of the Panamint (Shoshonean) Indian basket work in which the ornamentation has been a matter of especial study. Plate 183 illustrates five examples from Dr. Merriam’s collection, which I am allowed here to reproduce. Before speaking of them it will be at once noticed that these Indians, whose origin, or at least most numerous kindred, are in the Interior Basin, have been in contact with well-known California tribes and have been subjected to their influence. (See also Plate 185.)
Fig. 1 will be recognized at once in its relationship with the Tulare tribes. The ornamentation consists of four cycloidal radii made up of rectangles in black, arranged in stepped pattern. Each one of these rectangles is ornamented with two double chevron patterns called hourglass designs by Dr. Dixon. In some examples the color is mixed red and black. Collections of short and parallel lines on the border terminate the patterns.
Fig. 2, another Panamint bowl, has the center ornamented with groups of small rectangles in threes. The first band near the bottom has for decoration a design which resembles a barbed harpoon head with unilateral prongs. The principal band on the body is decorated with a series of rhombs in black, containing white and black designs within. In some of the Californian eastern tribes this design represents the eye, but until the symbol is surely known, denotive names are better. The border is decorated with groups of short marks in threes.

Fig. 3 is a bowl with plain center, excepting a short owner’s mark, and on the body are two bands, each one decorated by a threefold cheyroned pattern. It will be noted that the offsets in the three boundary lines of the designs are exactly in line with the finishing off at the upper border. This feature is often mentioned by basket collectors among other tribes.
Fig. 4 is another Panamint bowl, the interior decorated by plain rings in black. From the bottom project four equidistant wedgeshaped designs decorated on the surface with rhombs in white. On the border, the pattern shown in fig. 1 appears rectangular in form with eight single chevroned designs on the surface. One of the patterns is abbreviated, and between the two wedge-shaped designs on the right side of the figure is an arrow motive which may represent arrowheads strung or the feather of the arrow notched.
Fig. 5 is another Panamint bowl, with five wedge-shaped designs on the body, proceeding from a dark ring bordering the bottom. Each design has outside edges bordered in white, with serrate edges in brown and straight venations in white on the middle portion. The little groups of marks in threes on the border have nothing to do with the radiate pattern.
Plate 154 is introduced here for the purpose of showing how the colors mentioned in the foregoing pages are used in giving variety and beauty to the surface of the ware in this area. The yellow golden color is that of the usual sewing material. The black is produced by the use of martynia. The red is from the Vucew arborescens. In the ordinary photographic plate the effect of these colors is lost, but in the illustrations here given the full effect is brought out. Attention is called also in the lower figure to the union of two methods of sewing. In the figured stripe in the middle, open sewing is shown, while on the vest of the body the stitches are packed close together. It has Panamint designs. On the upper bowl they are Yokut, but the materials of both are Panamint. The open weaving also and the shred foundation point in the same direction.
The following information concerning the basket tangle in this area is from Mr. C. P. Wilcomb, of the Golden Gate Park Museum, San Francisco. The Inyo and the Kern (Inyo-Kern) basketry are virtually undistinguishable, the tribes are Paiute (Shoshonean). The Tulare County basketry is that of the Yokuts, and is identical with that of the Yokuts of Fresno County and of the Monache or Monos (Shoshoneans inhabiting the headwaters of the San Joaquin and Kings rivers). The Monache and the Fresno work are somewhat coarser than that of the Tulare tribes, but in materials and shapes are identical. The Kern tribes are mostly on upper Kern River in the vicinity of Kernville.

<<<Page: 505>>>

The distinction between the two groups seems to rest on a geographical basis, inasmuch as the Inyo-Kern tribes are all east of the SierraTehachapi range, and the other group, both Yokuts and Shoshonean Monache, west of the main divide.
The Tulare-Fresno foundation is made of grass stems (Sporobolus vilfa, or Hpicampes rigens). The Inyo-Kern foundation is of willow (Salix lasiandra) or sometimes of the root of sumac (hus trilobata). For the Tulare sewing, dium mariscus) are used, while in the Kern, willow is usually employed. For the red of their patterns the Tulare-Fresno women employ the redbud (Cerc7s occidentalis), which is coarser than the root of the Yucca arborescens, used for the same purpose by the Inyo-Kern and Panamint. The Yueca root is of light yellowish red like willow bark, but is sometimes as dark as cercis. In some of the burden baskets and winnowing trays willow bark is used for red. The Paiutes do not use redbud. For black the Tulare-Fresno women use the common fern root (Pteridium aquilinum), while in Inyo-Kern and Panamint the heart of the tule root (Sc/rpus nevadensis) and Martynia are employed. In Inyo-Kern ware quail tips and red wool are rarely used on baskets as they are on Tulare; but small private marks and symbols are wrought with split pink quills from the woodpecker known as redshafted flicker. The Tulare make many large bowl-shaped baskets. In Inyo they are small, if of this shape.
Plate 185 will emphasize the difference hinted at in the foregoing text between the coarser and finer weaving in the same area. The upper figure in the plate is a Tejon bottle-necked jar in the collection of EK. L. McLeod, of Bakersfield. The ornamentation is the striped pattern well known among the different tribes in this area. The foundation is laid up rather wide for the size of the basket and the sewing far apart, the stitches not being crowded home. Compare this with the specimen which follows.
Fig. 2, catalogue No. 204851, U. S. National Museum, is a fine coiled basket bowl collected by Eugene Mead. The foundation is of the three-stem type. The sewing is in splints of Cladium. The ornamentation is in the black fern root (Pter¢dium aquilinum). There are nine rows of sewing and thirteen stitches to the inch, but the most remarkable feature in this large bowl is that the three rods foundation and the sewing together make a fabric not an eighth of an inch in thickness. The designs are two serrated lines in black. On either side is a combination of symbolic figures which almost resemble letters of the alphabet. There is no exact history of this basket, but it is pronounced by Dr. Merriam to be the Fresno type of Yokut basket. It is an intrusive form among the Owens Valley Paiutes, captured by them on a raid into the interior side of the Sierra Mountains a long time ago. Its height is 7¢ inches, and diameter 15 inches.

<<<Page: 506>>>

Plate 186, one of the interesting specimens in Mr. Wilcomb’s colleetion, is an Inyo basket, made in Inyo County by a Tulare (Yokut) squaw. Itis 13 inches in diameter. The ornamentation outside the plain center is radial in two bands of stepped patterns, the inner band of six, the outer of thirteen. Each one of the latter having five parallel elements, there are with the interspaces seventy-cight elementary stepped designs in the band. The border is the oft-recurring bunch of colored stitches in groups.
Plate 187 represents baskets in the collections of, Powers and Gayin and Leonard. They are Tulare, but an examination shows what has heretofore been alluded to, the difference between the open and rather coarse texture of the Tulare basket mentioned by Mr. Wilcomb and the very much more refined type of the Inyo-Kern makers as in the lower figure. One characteristic worthy of observation is the use the weaver has made of small differences of shade in the splints for sewing, giving a clouded effect to the surface.
From the Tule River country, says EK. L. McLeod, we have the fine flexible work, an improvement on their more northern sisters in Fresno. But the women of the Tejon and adjacent mountain tribes certainly excelled in their basket work. Their choice ware is much more beautifully finished, their patterns much more numerous, and here is where they show the influence of both north and south in the number and diversity of their patterns, also in the trading of materials. Old baskets have been taken from the caves in the Tejon where the bottom was Mission and the top beautiful, fine Tejon; also examples brought from caves in Santa Barbara County that were made over in the Tejon, as the stitch, texture, and all general appearance eo to show that they were carried about by the Indians with them.
An excellent example of moving about of basket makers is given by McLeod. A woman was born at San Gabriel Mission, where she was baptized as Maria Narcissa, and is now about 70 years old. She was brought to the Tejon Canyon while a young child about 9 years old, and she still remembers much of the language and customs of her native people. Her uncle Sabastian was General Fremont’s guide into the San Joaquin Valley through the Tejon Pass. Maria Narcissa not only learned the language of her adopted people, but many of the dialects of the surrounding tribes. Between forty and fifty years ago she was taken as wife by a young American of EnglishGerman parentage. They were the parents of a large family of children, and he gave them all as good an education as possible, especially the eldest daughter.
She was not able to give much light on the general family relation. The tribes from the north as far up as Tule River used to come down to the Tejon for some purpose, either religious or social. She tells of great feasts and dances and great gaming baskets where they used to

<<<Page: 507>>>

play games of chance. But far the longest travel was from San Fernando, San Gabriel, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and Santa Inez. Many came from there every year to the Tejon, and we find unquestionable evidence in the meeting of all these streams in their basket work.
In a translation from Costans6 (1769)”¢ occurs this account of the Santa Barbara basket makers:

Plates 188 to 195 are taken from baskets in the McLeod collection and cover the subjects of form and design in the Inyo-Kern and TulareFresno area. They furnish an excellent opportunity of seeing how far a few simple geometric elements combine in kaleidoscopic effects in the hands of the skillful Indian woman. Some of these specimens are of exceeding delicacy, and it is a matter of wonder how so many little stems of uniform diameter could be gathered together. Gauges are out of the question.

Plate 193 is a fine coiled basket of the Kern County Indians, who belong to the Shoshonean family. It was made in Canebrake Canyon by the last old basket maker of the tribe, who was swept away ina flood in August, 1901. The decorative patterns are ideal. Nine vertical stripes in black and red, with stepped borders and diamond figures on the interior, rise from the plain bottom and extend to the lower edge of the rim. The latter has its own fine-checkered, sloping designs, with no relation to the decoration on the body. Circumference, 29 inches; diameter, 9 inches; height, 5 inches; stitches to the inch, 32; colors, red, black, and cream. A design of quail plumes is shown on the border.
Plate 194 is a coiled bottle neck from Cane Brake Canyon, Kern River, Kern County. Diameter, 9 inches; height, 6 inches; stitches to the inch, 24; color, cream, black, and brown. This and Plate 193 were both made by the same squaw, who was supposed to be about 85 years of age, and was the Jast really good weaver in Kern County. The ornamentation on this basket consists in a band of dentate figures on the bottom and three bands of crenelated ornament on the body and top. The dentate figures also occur on the outer projection of the crenelles on the body. Dr. Merriam has found this pattern symbolizing the spasmodic flight of a butterfly. Below the border of the lower band are rhombs in pairs, and there are five checker oblique patterns about the rim.

This specimen Catalogue No. 215586, in the U.S. National Museum, isa oift from C. P. Wileomb, of California.
Mr. McLeod, who has the largest collection of the grasshopper baskets, says of them that they have no such function. They are all made by two families, the Butterbread and the Williams, living in Kelsey Canyon, Kern County, California. The sewing and wrapping are faultless. The ornamentation is chiefly in plain lines and rectangles. On one of them, fig. 10, the chevroned design is attempted with doubtful success, but figs. 2 and 3 have the stepped radiat patterns well carried out, and on fig. 9 the human conventional figure is cleverly executed. (See Plate 196.)
Mission Indian basket makers belong to the Shoshonean and Yuman families. They receive their several names from the Franciscan missions of southern California, into which they were gathered, and where their tribal identity was lost. In the present state of knowledge it is not possible to distinguish the linguistic family by the shape, technic, or designs of basketry.
The material of Mission Indian baskets differs according to locality. A rush, probably several species, is used for the sewing; the best known to Mr. Coville is /uneus lesnert/, the Techahet Indians using it almost exclusively. This plant is collected and dried, and what are often thought to be brushes by strangers are merely bunches of this rush prepared for the weaver’s use, A tall, thin grass, V7 rigens, is used as the body of the coil, about which pieces of the /ncns are wound. Such of the latter as are intended for ornamentation are dyed black by steeping in water portions of Sueda diffusa, and a rich yellowish brown 1s produced in a like manner from the plants /a/ca emory? and Dalea polyadenia.. The bottoms of large baskets are often strengthened by the introduction of twigs of Rhus aromatica or threeleaf sumac. Dr. Merriam finds that latterly the leaf of a palin (.Veowashingtonia filamentosa) is used for sewing. The work resembles that done in rafia.
In beginning a basket a centrat foundation is made and the rush wound about it and coiled, fastened by fibers passing through holes made for the purpose with a pointed bone or metai awl. This is the commonest method employed.
To assist the student in understanding the relationship of arts in southern California, the following account of tribes from Dr. Barrows will be helpful. The Indian tribes south of Santa Inez Mountains on the coast and San Joaquin Valley in the interior fall into three divisions: (1) Tribes of Santa Barbara channels and islands covering the coast of Ventura County; (2) Serranos; (3) Coahuillas.

<<<Page: 513>>>

The Serranos live on a small reservation at San Bernardino and on the Morongo Reservation in the San Gorgonio pass in southern California. They are called Takhtam by Loew.
The Coahuillas live in the Colorado Desert and the San Jacinto Mountains. ‘The word is also spelled Kauvuyah by Gatschet after Loew. Dr. Barrows thinks this to be only the German spelling for Coahuilla (pronounced Kau-viiyah).
With them he joins by speech the Indians of the missions northward, making a Coahuillian linguistic family; perhaps it were better a subfamily.

Barrows narrates that the Coahuilla basketry and that of the Dieguefos as well as Luisefios is of the one California type, namely, coiled ware, and fragments of similar technic have been found by Schumacher in the graves of the Santa Barbara channel. He quotes Humboldt to the effect that the Indians presented the Spaniards ‘‘ with vases curiously wrought of stalks of rushes and covered within with a very thin layer of asphaltum that renders them impenetrable to water.” Lumps of the material are said to have been put into the basket with hot stones and shaken with a rotary motion to distribute it. The foundation of the coil is a bunch of grass, su-ul (V7/fa r/gens). The sewing material varies according to the color desired. The three-leaf sumac (Rhus trilobata) gives a light straw color; these are dyed black in a wash, made from the berry stems of the elder, hun kwat (Sambucus). The other sewing material is a bulrush or reed grass (Juncus lesnerii, or Juncus robustus). The scape and leaves are 2 to 4 feet high or more, stout and pungent. A supply of these is gathered by the basket maker and cut into suitable lengths. The woman then with her hands and teeth splits the scape carefully into three equal portions. Near its base the reed is of a deep red, lightening in color upward, passing through several shades of light brown, and ending at the top in a brownish yellow. For dyeing black, ngaial (Seda diffusa) is also employed, and Dr. Palmer also mentions a dahlia (2). polyadenia) as furnishing a yellowish brown dye.
The Techahet, use the reed grass (Juncus robustus) or the Rhus

making basketry, the first two for binding material, the latter for the hody. The reed grass is split, some of it dyed, usually brown. The basket is begun at the center of the bottom, the thickness of the coil of grass depending upon the size of the basket to be made. A bone pricker is used. The coil is begun by laying one end of the filament upon the bunch of grass and taking a few wraps about it to hold it down. This is bent double and the sewing progresses by catching the filament over the bunch of grass through the coil of the sewing filament made at the last turn.
Basket making among the Coahuillas belongs to the old women. They sit flat on the ground with the feet thrust out in front. The deft artist holds her work in her lap, at her right lies the grass for the foundation, on her left, soaking in a pot of water, her variously colored splints. Her only tool is her awl, ** wish,” anciently of bone or a cactus spine set in a piece of asphaltum; but now a nail serves the purpose. one end pointed, the other in a handle of manzanita wood. The sewing materials are named according to colors—the scapes of jincus se il; the red portion, ii ul; dyed black they are se-il-tu-iksh. Splints from sumac are se-lit and the grass of the foundation suul. No model or pattern is ever used. The border is finished by simply cutting the sewing material close on the inner side. The most common form, se-whal-lal, of Coahuilla basket has a flat bottom and gently flaring sides, a depth of from + to 7 inches and a width of from 13 to 20 inches. These are for holding foods, including seeds, grains and fruits, household utensils, and basket materials. Small, globular baskets, with bulging sides and rather wide mouths, 5 to 10 inches in diameter, are called te-vin-ze-mal. They are the prettiest and the most carefully ornamented and are used to hold trinkets and sewing materials. The deep packing baskets, se kwa-vel-em, are about 18 inches deep and are used for packing loads. Rawhide strings, ka wi ve, are tied to opposite edges to pass around the forehead, but usually the basket is sustained inanet. They are used not only for food gathering, but on the threshing floor for storing foods. The chi-pat-mal is around, almost flat basket, 16 to 18 inches in diameter and one or more inches deep, used for harvesting. The woman heats it full of grass seeds or fills it with elder berries or cactus fruit, and transfers the contents to the packing basket on her back. It makes a good tray, platter, fruit dish, or receptacle for meal, and is exclusively the winnower.
The basket hat, yu-ma-wal, shaped like a truncated cone, is worn by women especially to protect the head from the carrying band. It serves also for a water dipper or mixing pan. The chi-pa-cha-kish, holding about 2 quarts, is an openwork basket of network, made from the unsplit, flattened scapes of the se-il, or Juncus. They are often

provided with a bail and hung up in the house or ramada to contain fruit or vegetables.¢
Fig. 174 is a coiled basket of the Coahuilla (Shoshonean family). The foundation coil is of stems of grass; the sewing is in splints of sumac (Rhus trilobata). The ornamentation is in stems of rush dyed black with sea blite (Sweda diffusa).
No special study has been made of the meaning in the designs upon the Coahuilla basketry. It is impossible, therefore, to guess what the combinations of parallelograms may mean. From the point of view of elementary forms in design, it is interesting to note what diversities of effects may be produced by variations in the form and composition

half inward from the base, forming a continuous circle. One row is so suggested with reference to the other that the white space between forms a continuous chevron. It is a little difficult to say whether the whole meaning of such a result from simple processes was in the mind of the basket maker. While not wishing to deprive her of all the credit due to her for this beautiful work, one can scarcely refrain from thinking that the total effect was not comprehended by the artist.
This specimen, Catalogue No. 21786 in the U.S. National Museum, was collected in southern California by Edward Palmer.

The lower figure is an example of the same kind of coiling, but the surface has been covered with asphalt, so that the texture is almost totally obliterated.
Twined weaving is not so common as coiled work in southern Cali fornia. One could scarcely conceive a more primitive specimen, however, than is shown in fig. 178, from the Dieguefios Indians (Yuman family) living about San Diego, California. The specimen is a basket for cactus fruit. The warp is gathered singly or in pairs in the twists of the weft. Old specimens of twined weaving from the region, on the contrary, are finely wrought.

Grande, on the Mission Indian Reservation, in southern California, by Mrs. Watkins, the Government teacher there, and sent to the National Museum by Miss Constance Goddard DuBois. The dark threads are said, by Mrs. Watkins, to be made from the inner bark of Asclepias vestita and the lighter threads, in which the decorative bands are worked, from Asclepras ascicularis. It is a very ancient piece, the only one that had been seen in those parts. Narciso Lachapa, whose father owned it, says it was old when he was a boy.
The majority of baskets from the Mission region are in coiled weaving. A few examples of twined weaving from this area have been seen in collections, but none equalling this in size and beauty. Its height is 29 inches.
THE INTERIOR BASIN REGION Not the hands, but reason teaches mankind arts; but the hands are the instruments of arts, as the lyre is of the musician and the forceps are of the mechanic.—GALEN.
Leaving now the Pacific slope we may examine the basketry of the Great Interior Basin, bounded on the east by the Siouan, Kiowan, and Caddoan families beyond the Rocky Mountains. The Siouan tribes, together with the western Algonquian and other tribes wedged in among them, borrow coiled gambling baskets and substitute the convenient buffalo hide for textiles; but the Caddoan (see figs. 124, 125) were excellent workers in twilled weaving.
On the north, this basketry area merges into the Fraser-Columbian group, Salishan and Shahaptian tribes chiefly, who are especially skillful in twined work of peculiar types. The soft hat in wrapped twined work and most of all the twined wallet overlaid predominate with the Shahaptian, but the Salish have a wide range of technic.
On the west there is no sharp boundary line as will be soon shown, the Interior Basin area and the Oregon-California fitting into and invading each other as shore and water line on an irregular coast. This will be especially noticeable with coiled work, the three-rod foundation of California being adopted by some Ute tribes.
The same is true of the southern boundary, the linguistic families dovetailing into those of Mexico. The Apache cross the boundary southward, the Yuman and Piman tribes also reaching northward and excelling in coiled ware with fine grass foundation.
The tribal or ethnic groups in this area are chiefly the Shoshonean and the Athapascan. The first named is a vast linguistic family reaching from near the forty-ninth parallel to Costa Rica, the latter, quite as widespread, extending between 30° and 70° north. Care must again be taken to separate the classific concept of language from that of blood kinship or of arts. Where peoples live contiguous and have the same speech, their blood becomes mingled as a matter of course. Arts will also be communicated. Especially is this true of the one

<<<Page: 520>>>

here considered, being a woman’s craft. The Athapascan occupies the southern portion of the Basin, and the Pueblos are most of them in northern Arizona and New Mexico.
sv far the largest part of the Interior Basin is Shoshonean. The tribes also spread out far to the north in the drainage of the Snake River; have pushed themselves across the Rocky Mountains on the southeast into the drainage of the Gulf of Mexico, and on the western side occupied a large part of southern California as was shown. The basket-making tribes are the Shoshoni in Idaho; the Ute, with many subdivisions, in Colorado and Utah; the Paiute in western Nevada and California adjoining. As before intimated, both exclusions and inclusions of the term are undefined.
This great stock of Indians employ both structures, the woven and the coiled. The twined weave of all kinds is used in the conodial basket hats, the baskets, jars and bottles, the roasting trays and wands. The coiled and whipped structure is used in pitched water bottles, trays, and bowls. The hat is a conical basket made of splints, the warp radiating from the apex, the woof splints being carried around and twined in pairs, generally in diagonal weave. The woof is not so thoroughly driven home as in softer and more plant material, but remains open so as to have the appearance of the osier weaving of the East. Simple ornamentation is produced by using one or more rows of red or black splints in elementary geometric patterns.
Roasting trays are shaped like a scoop rimmed with a large twig. The warp is made of parallel twigs laid close together and held in place by diagonal twining. The Shoshonean tribes place seeds of wild plants in these trays with hot stones, and thus roast them. Some specimens are much charred on the upper side. In the Ute country could be seen Indian women gathering seeds in conical baskets, beating the heads with a spoon-shaped wand toward the basket held in the left hand with its mouth just under the plants. These baskets are constructed in every respect like the conoidal hats and the fans are made of twigs coarsely woven on the same pattern.
The water bottles of the Shoshonean tribes on the other hand belong to the coiled and whipped structure. As before mentioned, this style can be made coarse or fine, according to the material and the size of the coil and the outer thread. If twigs not of uniform thickness are carried around in the coil, the stitch will be hatchy and open; but if one is larger than the other, or if yucca or other fiber replace the upper and narrower sewine material be used, the texture will be much finer.

small mouths; one class has a little osier handle on the side of the mouth like a pitcher, but the majority have one or two loops of wood, horsehair, or osier fastened on one side for carrying. All of them are quite heavy, having been dipped in pitch. The same form is found among the Apache, Mohave, Hopi, and Rio Grande pueblos, but. it is not improbable that they were obtained from the Ute. These bottle-shaped baskets are used for small granaries as well—to hold seed and keep them away from vermin.
The basket trays of the Ute do not differ essentially in general style from those of the Gila River or California tribes, but they are much coarser. Among the coiled basket trays in the collection accredited to the Ute are indeed two styles, but one of them resembles so much those of their Apache neighbors on the south as to raise the suspicion that they were obtained by barter.

Cat. No. 11888. Collected by J. W. Powell.
The typical styles here mentioned, as well as interesting variations, will be best understood from examples.
The National Museum has a rare old collection of Ute or Shoshonean material, of which A. H. Thompson writes that of the baskets and other articles of Indian manufacture gathered by the Powell expeditions between 1870 and 1875 the greater part, probably nine-tenths, were secured from the Kaivavits at Kaibab and the Shivwits about St. George, southern Utah, and the Moapas about St. Thomas, southeastern Nevada. These clans all belong to the Paiute Nation. The articles secured from the Ute were from the Gosiute about Deep Creek in western Utah and the Uinta Ute on the Uinta Reservation. By far the larger part of the Paiute collection was from the Kaivavits. Much of the clothing (buckskin and rabbit fur) and many of the baskets were made by the Indians working under the direction or

rather observation of Mrs. E. P. Thompson, the endeavor being to have the work done by the methods employed before the coming of the whites and by the older people of the clan.
Fig. 179 isa hat of a Ute Indian woman, in diagonal twined work. The warp stems converge at the top and additional ones are added as the texture widens. The weft splints are twined so as to include the vertical warp twigs in pairs. On the next round the warp elements are again inclosed in pairs, but not in corresponding ones to those of the row underneath. The lines of weft elements ascend diagonally and a twilled effect is produced on the surface. This form of twining must not be confounded with three-ply twine around the border which has a somewhat similarappearance, but is so close that the warp stems do not show. The border of this Ute basket is ingeniously made. First, the projecting warp elements were bent and whipped in place with splints to form the body of the rim; on the top of this the weaver has sewed an ornamental false braid catching the splint into the bent warp stems underneath. The ornamentation on the outside is produced by three-strand monochrome or dichrome weaving. The Utes are skillful in various methods of technic, but the materials in which they work are coarse and rigid, giving a rough appearance to the surface. The hats are used also as receptacles, so that the terms top and bottom are only relative to function.

brought together to a point, at the same time bent downward in spoon form for a warp. These are held in place by a continuous twined weaving backward and forward, the rows being at irregular intervals. Near the end the points are held together by compact twined weaving. ‘Fhe border is made by coiled work built up on a pair of strong rods. These interesting objects are not confined, as will be seen, to the Ute Indians, but all the tribes in California, Nevada, and Arizona that depend upon the smaller seeds for their sustenance have the same method of beating the ripe grass into a conical carrying basket. ‘The fans of this type, perhaps, form the very earliest harvesting device.
Associated with the harvesting fan is the gathering and carrying basket and the roasting or winnowing tray.

Figs. 182 to 184 illustrate a gathering basket of the Paiute Indians. The first, fig. 182, represents the entire structure which is at basis open-twined work. The noticeable feature about this piece is the treatment of the warp, which, instead of rising perpendicularly from the bottom to the top, is twisted to the left, each radial element of the warp making about one-fourth of a turn from the vertical. Again, the technic is diagonal weaving in twined work. The diverting of the warp from the vertical is not common in twined weaving, but occurs quite frequently in this area and among this family.
Iie. 183 gives a good notion of the way in which the bottom is started. four pairs of warp stems constitute the base. These are held in place by very coarse twined weaving. The ends of the stems are bent up to become the warp of the body. The upper border of the basket shows how the warp stems are bent down to the left; a bundle

Fig. 185 is a harvesting and carrying basket of the Paiutes in diagonal twined Weaving, precisely as in fig. 179 representing a Ute woman’s hat, and fig. L180 the fanning tray. The bottom is covered with hide to protect it and on the side is fastened a headband used in carrying. The ornamentation onmany Ute specimens seems to have been effected by charring, since — the figures do not appear on the inside at all.

used for the purpose of separating the chaff from the seeds which have been gathered either by blowing or roasting. The warp is a lot of twigs spread out like a fan. The weaving begins at the inner or manual end,which is the bottom of the illustration, with short curves and progresses by ever widening rows to the outer margin. The rim is produced by a double row of coiled and whipped work. The whole surface is very rough by reason of the nature of the material which these people living in a desert region have to use.

pitch of some kind, varying in different localities. The peculiar effect of this sort of weaving is to hide one of the rods in the foundation and to reveal the other. Frequently, the upper one in each pair is smaller, and by driving the stitches close home a tolerably close and very enduring structure is the result.

Plate 204 presents two figures from different localities, but having essentially the same form, structure, and function. That on the left, catalogue No. 19029 in the U. S. National Museum, is a fine old water jar made by a Coyuwee Paiute woman, Pyramid Lake, Nevada, secured by Stephen Powers. It is a model of uniformity in technic. The twilled weaving in twined technic is laid up as regularly as brickwork. There is no attempt at ornament, either in color or variety in weaying. The pine gum is applied so carefully that it does not hide but emphasizes the workmanship. The lugs are of braided horsehair. — Its height is 15 inches.

In a paper by Dr. George H. Pepper,” attention is called to a cliff people formerly living in Grand Gulch region of southeastern Utah ‘alled the ‘* Basket Makers.” They are shown to have worn beautiful robes of feathers and of rabbit skins woven, and sandals of yucca fiber squared in front, and to have had little or no pottery. They fought with ‘tatlatls” rather than bows, and hunted with the Hopi rabbit stick. Most interesting of all, they lived in caves, but not in stone houses. In some of the caves the houses of the Cliff Dwellers have been found overlying the remains of the earlier Basket Makers. Finally, the bodies of the dead were doubled up, placed at the bottom of potholes or granaries, some of which were lined with baked clay, covered with robes and finally with baskets, either several small ones or one large carrying basket. The lastnamed feature is said to have been almost invariably in evidence, and it is to this that attention is here given. The material is willow, the designs on the baskets being in splints of black ora peculiar dull red. The bottoms of the carrying baskets were reenforced with heavy yucca cord. The borders were finished with the ordinary coiled stitch, but in some the last inch or two are finished off with false braid or herringbone.
One example of Dr. Pepper's, called openwork or sifter basket, has a single rod foundation and the wrapping at one turn passes around the foundation only; at the next it is drawn under the rod in the coil below and returning is wrapped about itself or ‘*the standing part,” as the sailors say. The ordinary J apanese lunch baskets, Samoan basket work, and those from the Straits of Magellan are on the same plan. But it is certainly a rare sight in this part of the world. (See Plate 317.)
Plates 205 and 206 are from the Pepper collection of coiled basketry from the caves of the ancient Basket Makers. The particular specimens will be described under separate photographs of each one, but the group shows both the forms and functions of the material gathered in this interesting locality.

Plate 207 is a coiled tray, having as design two circles of figures resembling aquatic birds floating on the water. This is an excellent opportunity to speculate about the relation of this desert region with prayers to the water god.
Plate 208 is another coiled tray from the cave dwellers, with an ornamental design, showing two sinuous rings in black.
Plate 209 contains two bowls apparently with the three-rod coil; such is now common among the best basket makers of California. The ornamentation is also suggestive of the same locality. On the upper figure are four radial designs triangular in outline, two having their bases at the bottom and two on the outer border, each pattern made up of fringe work of triangles, reminding one of the strings of arrowhead patterns mentioned by Dr. Dixon in his pamphlet on the Maidu. The lower figure is similarly constructed in coiled weaving, the ornamentation being in circular patterns; the bottom is plain; then follow narrow rings in black, a broad ring in white, a broad band with seven triangular rays, a narrow band in black, and a broad band in the natural color of the wood.
Plate 210 is interesting as showing the function of the baskets which were found in the Utah cave. All of them have relation to food. They are in twilled and coiled weaving and show how in ancient times the basket entered into the service of these agricultural Indians.
Plate 211 shows a mortar basket of the ancient basket makers in coiled weaving on splint foundation. ‘It is not possible to determine the material of the stitches. It is 13 inches in diameter and 34 inches deep. The interior is coated with meal and the surface of the sewing is worn through from long use. Mortar baskets are common among the California tribes, both in twined weaving and in coiled work. A specimen quite similar to the one here shown in the U. 5. National Museum has a coiled basket top, cemented to the shallow mortar stone underneath by means of pitch. The specimens are in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History.
Pepper describes four varieties of sandals among the ancient Cliff Dwellers—thin soles in twilled weaving from narrow leaves of yucca; those made of broad leaves split; a padded variety made from the same leaves shredded; and an exceedingly fine kind, of spun fiber and worked into-elegant patterns. In these last the warp is in two or more layers or plies, so that the body is thick and durable. He quotes Richard Witherill to the effect that while the chamber-building Cliff Dwellers wove the sandal with pointed toes and a jog or step a few inches from the toe, those of the Basket Makers were square in front. McLoyd and Graham “ assert that square-toed sandals were made by the people that inhabited the underground rooms, since they are found only with
«Guide Leaflet, No. 6, of American Museum of Natural History, New York.

<<<Page: 530>>>

mummies of that race. No square-toed sandals are found in caves where remains of the basketmakers do not exist.
The term Pueblo basketmaker is far from specific. It applies to women of all the settled villages in New Mexico and Arizona, from Taos on the Rio Grande, in the former, to the Hopi in Arizona. The peoples belong to the Tafoan and Keresan families on the Rio Grande, to the Zunian in western New Mexico, and the Hopian or Shoshonean in Arizona.¢
Far back in time those structures whose ruins furnish inexhaustible supplies of pottery and some textiles have to tell the tale as to the ancient types of basketry. At the present moment great confusion exists concerning the ethnic significance of basketry in the pueblos. Beautiful old pieces came twenty years or more ago from these villages about which there is little information. James Stevenson wrote then that the women of the villages were fond of securing in trade and hoarding rare forms and weaves. The best that can be now done is to classify Pueblo basketry as follows:
(1) What the women are actually making and old material precisely like it.
(2) Specimens dug from sites of old pueblos and carefully labeled.
(3) Old materials stored up in the modern pueblos, handed down from the past, whose authorship is not known.
If all this material could be assembled a variety of technical processes would be revealed, some of them common over wide areas and a few characteristic of the pueblo culture. The following weaves are among the list:
(1) Checker weaving, rare.
(2) Wicker weaving, coarse and fine.
(3) Twilled work, in hard stems and in yucca.
(4) Twined work of many kinds on old baskets. Thought to be intrusive.
(5) Coiled work with foundation of stems, splints, grass, and shredded leaves. The fine wicker and the thick coiled plaques are peculiar. The great variety mentioned is quite as much between pueblos as between these and tribes outside. The Hopi are noteworthy in this regard, having in their hands the making of the two unique kinds of weave in their sacred meal plaques. A better insight into these differences will be gained by an examination of specimens.
Plate 212 represents two ancient coiled basket jars collected at the pueblo of Sia, on the Jemez River, a tributary of the Rio Grande in New Mexico. The Indians of this pueblo belong to the MKeresan family. The characteristics to be observed and studied on these speci-

mens are the following: The foundation is of splints, the sewing is done with willow or rhus, and the stitches are just barely carried around a small portion of the foundation underneath where they are interlocked. Note also that the ornamentation—an ascending spiral— is in one case a rhombic figure and in the other is built up of little rectangles formed by counting stitches, which may be few or many, as the curve on the body of the basket expands or contracts. This mingling of very simple elementary forms is capable of an infinite variety in treatment.
The attention of the student is especially called to the margins of these baskets, which appear to be in a three-strand plait; but they are really done in a single splint which passes backward over the foundation, then under and forward, inclosing the rod underneath, forming a figure of 8, and the multiplication of this produces on the surface the braided appearance. , For detail, see page 276, fig. 87. Catalogue Nos. 184214, 184215. Collected by James Stevenson.
Although there may be seen at the pueblo of Zuni all sorts of baskets, the most of them include pitched bottles for water, coiled and whipped trays, Hopi-coiled and wicker-basket trays, but it is not to be understood that they were necessarily made there. The only work made by the Zuni nowadays is their small, rough peach baskets, of twigs and wickerwork, hardly worthy of notice except for their ugliness and simplicity. Those who are familiar with this interesting tribe of Indians say that trading is a passion with them, and that through their agricultural products and their refined loom work they are able to gratify this taste among the surrounding tribes for old basketry.
Plate 213 shows some old so-called Zuni ware, collected for the Bureau of American Ethnology by James Stevenson in New Mexico long ago.
Fig. 1 is a wicker basket, globular form. The warp consists of a number of stems of Chrysothamnus laid flat. The weft of the same material is in wickerwork, the border being fastened down in coiled sewing with yucca leaf. Handle, a rawhide thong. Used by these Indians in gathering fruit and other food substances. Height, 8 inches. Cat. No. 68603, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 2 is a jar-shaped basket of Chrysothamnus (Bigelovia) splints. The warp is radiating at the bottom and parallel on the body; the whole basket is made in twilled style of twined weaving over two. The border is not finished off. The handle is a rawhide thong around the neck. This is a very coarse specimen of twined work. The height is 8 inches. Cat. No. 68480, U.S.N.M.

ing, without variation. There is not in the National Museum collection from this Pueblo region another basket in which the whole body is treated in this monotonous manner. Its height is 84 inches. Cat. No. 68513, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 4 is a water-tight jar from the Zui Indians. The whole surface of the object is in twilled type of twined weaving and well saturated in pitch. The characteristic feature is the lugs of wood on the side for the carrying strap, and flattening of the surface between these lues, as ina canteen. This is partially shown in the photographs, but is quite apparent on the jar itself. Its height is 9 inches. Cat. No. 68515, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 5 is a water-tight basket jar constricted in the middle for the attachment of a carrying strap. The whole surface is in coarse twilled weaving in two-strand twine with the exception of one row between the bottom and the body, which is in three-strand. The constriction of the body is said to be an imitation of a custom of tying rag around the young gourd so as to stop its growth, which results in a modification, useful for holding the carrying strap. Its height is 9 inches. Cat. No. 68541, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 6 is a water-tight basket jar from the Zudi Indians, symmetrical in outline. It is in the twilled type of twined weaving, with wooden lugs on the side and no flattening of surface between them. Its height is 74 inches. Cat. No. 68502, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 7 is a gathering basket from the Zuni Indians. The weaving on the bottom and the body is in the twilled type of twined work; the neck, on the contrary, has about an inch of plain twined weaving and is finished off with four rows of three-strand twine. The border is in coiled sewing of yueca. This specimen, like the preceding, is made from the stems of Chrysothamnus. Its height is 7} inches. Cat. No. 68491, U.S.N.M.
Fig. 8 is a gathering basket from the Zuni Indians. The bottom is in twilled twined work; the body is in plain twined work relieved at varying distances with single rows of three-ply weaving; border finished off with coiled work in yucca. Its height is 6 inches.
The Zuni pueblos in western New Mexico lie in the very heart of the desert region. On the east are the Rio Grande pueblos, on the northwest the Moki, and far to the south the Gila River. Beside the settled communities long inhabiting this region, the Navaho and Apache are close at hand on every side, and the Utes are not far away. There is no surprise, therefore, in finding on the same plate illustrations of wickerwork, twined work in its many varieties of plain twilled and three-strand work, and all of these at times on the same piece of basketry.

No. 42168, init, James Stevenson; height, + inches. A jar-shaped coiled basket attributed by the collector to the Zuni Indians is shown in fig..189. It is a very beautiful and smooth piece of coiled ware, to which justice is not done by the drawing. In regularity of stitch, symmetrical shape, and ornamentation it is almost without fault. It belongs to the class of technic termed in this treatise rod and welt. The foundation consists of a single rod, over which is laid a thin splint, perhaps of the same material. The stitch passes over rod and welt in the row that is in progress of manufacture, and not only locks with the stitch underneath but in each case takes up the welt. This forms an excellent packing. The stitches are crowded so Closely together that in the original those of the different rows lie practically one over the other, with a slight inclination from the perpendicular. On the bottom, not. shown here, it has a circle in black from which radiates six spiral rays. On the body the ornamentation is as shown in the figure. It is made from the pod of Jartynia louiscana. On the shoulder two lugs of leather are sewed for the purpose of carrying the jar, being intended, doubtless, for the transportation of food or water. It is customary to attribute such ware to the Apache Indians, although in the National Museum there are quite a number of very old coiled jars of this type and fine workmanship purporting to come from the Zuni Indians. This specimen was gotten by Major Powell, one of the most careful collectors, so that there is no doubt of the location. It is possible, however, that the Zuni, since they are potters, may have acquired this coiled specimen in traffic.
The detail of this texture, both in its sewing and ornamentation, is illustrated in fig. 48, also by Cushing“

Formerly vegetal dyes were employed, red brown Ohaishi (Zhelesperma gracile); dark blue from seeds of Akaushi (//elianthus petiolaris); yellow from Asapzrani (Carthamus tinctorius); green or blue, rarely seen on old baskets. The following are their terms for basketry.

Plate 215 is the portrait of Kuchyeampsi, the Mishéngiintivi weaver of coiled plaques. Figures and colored plates of this ware are shown. (See Plates 30, 47,85, 93.) Photographed by George Wharton James.
Wicker baskets are made at the Hopi pueblo, Oraibi. The radiating framework is of slender shoots of siibi, hus trilobata. The interwoven element is of branches of hanoshivapi, Chrysothamnus graveolens, uso called Bigelovia, carefully smoothed and dyed, as in the coiled baskets, red brown, red, yellow, dark blue, purple, green, blue and white, the latter with kaolin.
The white of the background is applied after the basket is finished. The edge of the basket is finished with a winding of yucca over the several rods of rhus bent down after the basket has reached the size required. This edge is often painted with red ocher (Hough). The framework consists of two cross sets of twigs, four or more in a bar of the cross. These are firmly held together at their intersection by weaving. They are then spread out radially, the space being from time to time supplemented by additional stems. The worker provides herself with bunches of white, yellow, orange, purple, black, blue, and green twigs only a few inches in length. These she proceeds to weave into patterns of the greatest beauty, even imitating cloud effects seen on Japanese screens, using long or short twigs as the occasion demands, hiding the ends between the ribs and the filling of the preceding coils. (See Plate 216.)
The variety of ornament created with these poor appliances is marvelous. In no other tribe of Indians and in no other type of hasketry are more striking effects realized. it seems almost as though the women had set themselves the problem of producing with the least pliable materials the most versatile of effects, in which are

embodied the symbols of an intricate ritual, in all grades of symbolism from the pictograph to the mere conventional mathematical scene. Both, however, represent the same ideas. Under the influence of trade the ancient patterns are really mosaics and could be picked out. It will be easily seen that the figures on the back and front do not exactly conform, the corresponding square on the back being always one space to the right or left of the same in front.
Attention is called at this point to the ornamental beginning of the wicker plaque, or sacred meal baskets. In the chapter on structure attention is directed to the methods of holding the central warp stems together before bending them apart radially. Two methods are resorted to. On one, half a dozen or more stems are laid side by side and wrapped together by a process shown in fig. 38, after Miss White. The same number of stems are similarly joined and laid under this at right angles, the whole twelve being bound together by one or two rows of wicker weaving. From this central point the twelve or more wrapped stems are bent apart at equal distances and the regular wicker weaving proceeds. Ata certain distance outward new warp stems are added between each pair of those already in use, and from this circle the weaving proceeds to the margin.
With the same number of warp stems quite a different process is sometimes employed, by which the two sets of the upper and lower are held together in pairs by wicker weaving, and at an inch from the center the whole series are bound together as before and widening and weaving proceed in the same manner.
Fig. 190 is a coarse wicker tray of the Hopi Indians of northeastern Arizona, and is introduced for the purpose of illustrating the method in which the much finer work on the sacred meal trays is done. Here may be seen the plan of starting out with a few stems crossing each other at right angles for warp; the method of hiding the large end of the weft stems to become a portion of the warp, and the method of adding new warp stems as they are needed. Especial attention is called to the way in which several stems for weft are introduced at the same time and worked along in sets or series. The common method of working out the twill would be to introduce a weft stem, carry it as far as it would go, and then insert a new weft stem, but in this case the series of half a dozen stems are all worked at the same time. Compare description of a Mexican wicker basket, on page 527.
The modern twilled basketry is as rough as it can be. The same is true of the flat mats used about their dwellings; in fact, the mat and the basket are identical in weaving. The basket is formed by bending the mat over the edge of a hoop and sewing down with a row of twined weaving.
Plate 217, from a photograph the gift of G. Wharton James, represents an ancient basket maker of Oraibi. The picture is interesting beyond the mere twilled basket which she holds in her hand in the act

of mending a broken strand. The corn, the mixture of objects belonging to civilization and savagery, the homespun and woven clothing on herself, and the maiden at her side are alia study in the culture of the region. The adobe and stone wall and the coarse beams of wood inset must be included. It is an excellent picture of very little modified savage life. Yueca baskets and trays are made by the Hopi in plain checker; although the material is coarse, quite pleasing effects are produced by means of the two sides of leaf and different shades of the same size.
The twined ware of the Hopi are a few peach baskets and other domestic utensils, made in the same manner as the Ute hats, but there

is enough dissimilarity of form to give the Hopi the credit of inventing this peculiar style. (See Plate 218, figs. 4 and 7.)
Plate 218 shows a collection from Oraibi, the westernmost of the Hopi pueblos in northeastern Arizona, gathered by Colonel James Stevenson and Cosmos Mindeleff. The three types of work always in mind when Oraibi and the pueblos of the adjoining mesa are mentioned, to wit, twilled, thick coils, and wicker, are utterly wanting here. The cosmopolitan character of the Hopi is further attested by the varieties of technic in the plate. The baskets on the upper row are as follows, from left to right:
1. Water-tight coiled jar, with foundation of rods, sewing material of willow splints, the stitches interlocking, but not taking in any of

9. An old flat coiled dish, No. 41227, said to have come from Zufi, in western New Mexico, 74 eee in diameter
3. A delightful old gathering basket, No. 42126, from Oraibi. It is of the three-rod coiled variety and might be taken for the original elegant Pomo Bamtsuwu. Each stitch passes over three rods of the current foundation and under the upper rod of the coil underneath. Its height is 74 inches.
4. A oathering basket in twilled twined technic. On the bottom is 2 projection whose function is not known. Notice on the shoulder three rows of twined work over two warps. The difference between this and twilled work lies in this, that the weft elements embrace the same pairs of warps and are superposed. The border is finished off with a neat herringbone stitch. Catalogue No. 83977, U.S. National Museum. Its height is 6 inches.
The old pieces on the lower row are equally interesting.
1. A globose coiled jar in three-rod foundation, The workmanship is coarse, but the form is suggestive of old pottery. This specimen is No. 84596, U. S. National Museum, and is 7 inches in height.
A water jar in three-rod coil, modern, with lugs of horsehair on the side for carrying. The border is fastened off with a kind of sewing, here called false braid. The material for making the vessel water-tight is pine resin. Catalogue No. 42107, U.S. National Museum. Its height is 10 inches.
This interesting piece of water-tight twitled twined work 1s strengthened by an interior framework similar to that seen often in the large Zuni packing baskets for donkeys, and suggests the possibility of transporting water in the same fashion. ‘The weaving is rude, but all the better for holding pitch. The border, however, is neatly done in false braid. Catalogue No. 68506, U.S. National Museum. Its height is 15 inches.
The water jar constricted in the middle might with propriety be called a canteen. Frequently the savages in this arid region tie a bandage around a young gourd which afterwards takes the shape here shown. The foundation of the coil is more like that of Apache, the stitches interlocking. Indeed, the piece is labeled ** old Apache ” by the collector. It is numbered 40109 and is 8+ inches high.

inner side, done in yucea fiber. This process was repeated upon the loops thus constituted until the center of the wheel was reached. It is in effect a kind of coiled work in which the foundation is absent. Collected by James Stevenson.
Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was so fortunate as to recover from the Chevlon ruin, 15 miles from Winslow and in sight of the station Hardy on the Santa Fé Railroad, fragments of ancient basketry, shown in the accompanying plates. The custom of burying baskets with the dead is still preserved in the Tusayan towns, and from the specimens here figured, it has been inherited from ancient times. Baskets, says Fewkes, are not now made at the east mesa, and the craft is confined to the middle mesa and Oraibi.

Pueblo Indians, New Mexico. Collected by James Stevenson.
The wicker baskets from several graves at Chevlon were identical with those made to-day in the pueblo of Oraibi. Some of these specimens were painted on the surface a green color with malachite, or blue with azurite. In other examples the small stems had been stained before they were woven. Plate 219 represents a segment from a wicker basket made from the stems of Chrysothamnus graveolens. The warp consists of small bundles of stems; the weft, of the same material barked and smoothed down, in some places dyed. The interesting feature of the specimen is the increasing of the number of warp elements as the basket enlarges. At first in the drawing there are five bundles of stems; about 2 inches lower down the number ts

<<<Page: 540>>>

increased to seven, and near the bottom, by the introduction of new stems, ten warp elements are provided for. As in the modern basketry, in this ancient example the weft is soaked and woven in that condition and pressed home so effectually that the warp is invisible.
In Plate 220, tig. 1, is shown a specimen of ancient matting in twilled weaving. The work is done in split yueca leaves, just as to-day, and in certain places the figure shows where the leaf was stripped from the stalk. Examining the thousands of mats and soft baskets from the same pueblo reveals the identical method of doing the twilled work, but in a great many of the modern examples regular diaper patterns are introduced. In the same plate (fig. 3) is an ancient example of coiled basketry, having foundation of three stems or rods. By referring to the California basketry it will be seen that this foundation is the same. This makes a very smooth surface, easily distineuishable from the rugose condition of Apache basket built on a single rod.4
These specimens are Catalogue Nos. 157912, 157915, 157918 in the U.S. National Museum, and were procured at Chevlon, Arizona, by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes.
Plates 221, 222 illustrate the forms and uses of basketry in the pueblos of northeastern Arizona before the coming of the whites. The explorations of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in Sikyatki and Awatobi, and the Museum-Gates expedition in L901 to examine two ruins on the Jetyto Wash, a few miles from Keams Canyon, have brought to light wicker, twilled, and coiled basketry. The wickerwork is precisely identical with the little wicker trays or plaques made in the pueblo of Oraibi and used in their religious ceremonies. The twilled work is the matting of to-day, and the coiled resembles that of the Utes or Pimas rather than the Apaches, having a foundation not of rods, but of fine material. The uses of the basketry must have been in all respects as among the Hopis of our day, but Plate 223 shows the connection of such material with the care of the dead (Catalogue No. 213074). The plate illustrates the fact that coarse wicker matting was placed in the bottom of the grave; on this was laid a matting of yucca fiber, and on this was deposited the body. In the dressing of the hair, then as now, a plaited cord of human hair was employed. A description of its discovery appears in Dr. Walter Hough’s paper, Archeological Field Work in Northeastern Arizona.
Judging from the artifacts secured by the Museum-Gates expedition, these pueblos belong to the type of Awatobi and Sityatki, and, as far as appearances go, may have been contemporaneous. Dr. Fewkes regards Sityatkias one of the most ancient pueblos of the Hopi group. It is well known that Awatobi was inhabited up to the year 1700, but
“Smithsonian Report, 1896, pls. xxxm and xxxuit, after Fewkes.

<<<Page: 541>>>

there is no historical reference to the pueblos from which these specimens were derived, and there is no evidence of the Iron Age inthem. It seems probable, however, that they date before the year 1700, but just how much anterior it is not possible at present to say. “
A summary of Athapascan basketry in its ethnic areas would include the following :
The northern Athapascans in the interior of Alaska and in the Mackenzie drainage make coiled basketry in a variety of types, the material being willow and root of the conifers. The Pacific coast group, living formerly in Washington, Oregon, and northwestern California, near the sea, of which the Hupas are the best known, excel in twined work with decoration in overlaying, but these tribes have not the versatility of the Pomo, farther south. All the weaving is of one variety, well known in the region.
The southern Athapascans, under many names, practice both coiled and twined basketry. They base their coiled work on hard stems and sew them with splints of cottonwood, mulberry, sumac, and willow or strips of yucca. They also used agave fiber.
The mescal plant (gave americana), says Bourke, is to the Apache what the palm is to the East. It is baked in ovens for victuals and its juice is fermented to make a drink. For the basket maker the thorns are good needles, the fibers excellent thread material, and the flower stalk forms the frame of the carrying outfit.
The Apaches or southern Athapascan basket makers were formerly spread over eastern Arizona, western New Mexico, and in Texas along the Rio Grande, as will be seen in Powell’s linguistic map.? They were gathered on reservations by Gen. Nelson A. Miles. Scattered bands are to be found bere and there. Mr. James mentions one near Short Horn Mountains and in the neighborhood of Palomas and Agua Caliente, comprising about thirty families of basket makers. The collector or student must not be surprised, therefore, if in the hands of Apaches are seen work of other tribes. Indeed, he will frequently see the women borrowing materials, structures, forms, and even designs from outside. A large and varied collection of Apache ware is exhibited in the Free Museum of Phoenix, Arizona, collected by Messrs. Benham.
On the authority of Mrs. J. S. Newman there are five tribes on the Apache Reservation, and a few scattered members of other tribes, but five to class as basket makers. Of these the Tonto should rank first, making chiefly ollas, which require more skill than plaques or bowl shapes, and their work is universally even and good. Their

specimens are nearly always marked with the arrow point, the pattern running vertically from the center. Their proficiency is accounted for in the fact that the land allowed them on the Gila River is the least productive of any on the reservation, hence their dependence on basket making for a living.
The center or beginning of either Apache coiled bowl or olla is always wrapped with black (devil claw) and the rim finished with the same stitch as that used throughout the body of the work, both or either colors being used.
Plate 224 is a number of Apache coiled bowls belonging to the collection of J. W. Benham. The foundation is in whole stem and the sewing done with splints of white wood and martynia. A comparison of these ten pieces reveals tolerably well the genius of Apache decorations. There are discrete figures of men and beasts; there are both radial and concentric designs; in the crenelated (fig. 10) and fretted motives (figs. 5 and 9) suggestions arise which point to the Tulare area. The Apache, naturally a wanderer, has picked up here a little and there a little of design.
The White Mountain Apaches are clustered around Camp Apache, the agency, and on two of the large creeks running south from the Mogollon mesa. The art of basket making is not actively practiced at present, the younger members of the tribe finding it difficult to learn and saying that it injures their hands. Some of the old women, however, retain the ancient skill, and even superior work may he secured from the reservation. It may be said that the carrying baskets and the pitched water bottles are as frequently made as ever and are in constant use, whereas the finer bowls, which were formerly common, as among the Pueblo tribes, for storing meal, etc., are growing rarer every year and command high prices.
The baskets shown in Plate 225, Catalogue Nos. 213262 and 213268, U.S. National Museum, were secured at the agency in the summer of OO.
Fig. 1 is a small, well-woven bowl, the design representing the sunflower.
The second figure is a modern basket with geometrical pattern, which in certain portions is quite inaccurately worked out. On the whole the design is excellent.
Plate 226 represents coiled basket bowls of the White Mountain Apache. The foundation of the upper figure is of willow, the sewing in splints of white wood and martynia in alternate rows, which are divided into four sections by V-shaped ornaments effected by changing the direction of the lines in black.
The lower figure is the same material, foundation of rods, sewing in white and black coarsely done, stitches scarcely touching. The whole surface is covered with rhomboidal figures produced by crossing

of four sets of lines in pairs, passing in cycloidal curves from the bottom to the margin. Catalogue Nos. 213264 and 213265.
The specimens were coilected by Dr. Walter Hough on White Mountain Apache Reservation, 100 miles south of Holbrook, Arizona.
The symboi: is that of the martynia hooks, the sharp points having been allowed to project from the inner surface in certain areas.
The shoots for basket material are gathered in the spring, tied in bundles, and put away in the houses for future use, sometimes with the bark on, at others without. When the basket maker 1s ready the osiers are soaked thoroughiy in water; the stems are employed whole for the foundation of the coil, and the sewing is done oniy with the outer layer, the inner portions being peeled off and the splints scraped. One end is held in the mouth, the other in the left hand, whiie the steel knife, formerly the stone knife, is used in the right hand.

Fig. 192 shows the ornamentation on a coiled basket bowl of the Coyotero, on the San Carlos Agency, in southern Arizona. The parts are in threes; the smaller design is made up of a combination of little squares and_ triangles, the larger design being more complicated in its elements, with its three vase-shaped parts, which terminate in the dark circle of the center. The meaning of this design is unknown.
This specimen, Catalogue No 4428 in the U. $. National Museum, was collected on the Gila River, Arizona, by H. W. Read.
Fig. 198 is an old bottle-shaped coiled basket, made, according to Dr. Hough, long ago by the Mescalero Apache, before they adopted the present wide variety. The foundation of the coil consists of a rigid stem overlaid with soft fiber. The stitching passes over the

foundation of the coil, under the packing of the coil underneath. The sewing is done with splints of willow or cottonwood. The ornamentation consists of six rows of coiling in brown m: aterial on the neck, a row of black material on the shoulder, with two rows of chevrons on the body. The latest Apache has only black and white in decoration: red and brown are oid and rare.

Fig. 194 is a design ona coiled basket bowl of the Apache. The foundation of the bowl is the rod-and-splint pattern, and the sewing passes over it, under the splints of the coil below, the stitches interlocking. The design is in Martyn/a lou/s/ana. The apparently unsystematic ornamentation is, in effect, perfectly regular. Four lines of black stitching, of the same lengths in each, proceed from a black ring around the center. From the ends of these lines the sewing is to the left in regular curves. The four radiating lines are repeated and then the curved lines until the border is reached. The suggestion of lightning or the limbs of some insect has been made out. The design has not been explained by any basket maker.

Plate 227 represents a jar and a plaque by the Mescalero Apache Indians of New Mexico, collected by Dr. Walter Hough, Catalogue Nos. 204651 and 204646 in the U. S. National Museum. Especial attention is directed to the width of the coils in these baskets. It will be remembered that the Fraser River tribes in British Columbia obtained an economical result of widening coils by the introduction of narrow strips of wood instead of the roots or bundles of grass for the foundation. These Apache Indians have also discovered that using two or more rods, one lying on the top of the other, would give the same result. The stitches in yucca also, instead of passing underneath another rod in the coil below, are simply interlocked with the stitches underneath. The ornamentation is -produced by different colors of thesame substance. The outside of the leaf is green in different shades, but the inside of the split leaf is perfectly white. By exposing the inside or the outside the angular ornamentation results. In such wide foundation the designs must be very simple. The dark lines in the lower figure are produced by using the

examples with the plaques of the Hopi Indians demonstrates better
than any other figures yet employed the limitations of the basket maker
in the very elements of ornamentation. Each separate part of the
mosaic is a long stitch, set vertically in the jar and radially on the plaque or bowl. From this the basket maker can not escape.
Fig. 195 is labeled coiled basket of the Navaho. On the authority of C. M. O'Leary, of Abbottsford Inn, Los Angeles, California, the Navaho do not manufacture baskets; but they use a ceremonial basket that is made by the Apaches and comes from Arizona. Other obseryers attribute these curious pieces to the Ute; but old Navaho women still understand the art.

In this example the foundation isa single rod. The body color of the bowl is that of the wood.

passing by a ‘‘ figure of eight” movement under the foundation and over the outer margin. In the ancient days a Navaho woman invented this pretty border. She was seated

the god Hastseyath threw a small spray of juniper into her basket. Happy thought! She imitated the fold of the leaves on the border and the invention was complete. (Matthews. )
The decoration also of the Navaho baskets is in designs taking the form of bands for their sacred drums (fig. 196), and of crosses (fig. 195) for their sacred meal baskets. The colored bands on the drums are founded on a central stripe which
Fic. 197.

<<<Page: 548>>>

may be lignt or dark, and from the borders project variously notched or angular figures. ‘The one characteristic to which attention is always directed in this ware is the break in the band. It is mentioned elsewhere on the authority of Matthews that a line drawn from the center of the basket through this open pathway will end at the point where the basket was finished off, and when it is used as a drum this is the point where the hand of the medicine man must be placed in the plaque, the radial line pointing eastward. Another interpretation of this, which can not here be proven, is that this break in the ornamentation has something to do with the passing backward and forward of the spirit of the basket, as in the Pueblo pottery decoration.” (See figs. 196 and 197.)
Dr. Ales Hrdlicka writes that the basket work of the Hualapai and Havasupai can be studied better by having it understood that although both these peoples are associated with the Yuman family linguistically, they are decidedly one with the Apaches in physical characteristics. Their basketry, therefore, will have to be compared with that of the Apaches and not that of the Mission Indians of southern California, who are Yuman. The foundation is a solid stem with a welt. The sewing is done with splints of willow, and also now with those made from the young and tender suckers from the cottonwood tree, from 2 to 3 feet in length. The geometric ornamentation is in martynia. Among the Hualapai and Havasupai there are three kinds of baskets—that is, three forms exist, but the Havasupai are the best workwomen. The first is coarse coiled ware. When the twining is going on they leave the finished ends projecting outside and inside until the whole basket is completed and afterwards they are trimmed off all at the same time. The second is « plain coiled bowl in the shape of a caraffe, covered with pitch to make it water-tight. The third is decorated coiled work. The first is a plaque with black decoration in martynia only. The second shape is more or less cylindrical, or the rim turning in or tending toward a spherical form. In the plaque there is seldom an. other decorative color than black, but the other forms, cylindrical snd globose, have various colors, although mostly different shades of vod. The designs are tooth-shaped or dentated, star-shaped, and crer lated. No curved lines or animal forms are used. The Hualapai aleo make conical carrying baskets with a head-band, the decorations bsing meager and consist only of lines, no geometric figures being used. Occasionally designs are painted, not woven. (See Plate 229.)
Plate 230, fig. 2, represents a Havasupai coiled basket bowl. The foundation is of rods and splints of willow and the sewing is the same. The most interesting feature is the border. It is false braid in which two rows of the coilare involved. A single splint passes down and includes

both foundations, up, over, and under the upper foundation only, then back and under both to the point of beginning. This is an old speeimen, had been in the possession of a family for many years. From the Sichomovi (Hopi) Pueblo, made by the Havasupai (Yuman) Indians, collected by Dr. Walter Hough.
Plate 231 represents the Havasupai basket maker at her home, which is in Cataract Canyon emptying into the Colorado River from the south, in northwestern Arizona. The most interesting feature of this plate is the association of the basket maker with her home. ‘The steep wall of the canyon forms the back of the house, and a slight brush awning covered with grass is her shelter. So far as the house is concerned, we are as near to the lowest savage and primitive man as it is possible to get, but in the woman and her work we are on the top round of savagery. The Apache-Yuma basket makers at Palomas, Arizona, sit in front of their brush and straw shelters the same as the Pimas, hold the right side of the plaque or bowl inward, and work their sewing toward the left hand. (G. C. Simms, Field Columbian Museum.) In the previous plate the woman is making coiled basketry, but in the one here given by George Wharton James the bottle and the carrying baskets are in twilled or diagonal-twined weaving.
The Walapai, spelled often Hualapai, from Walla, tall pine, Pai, people, are also of the Yuman family and dwell near Truxton, Hackberry, and Kingman, in northern Arizona. There are less than 600 of them. They make water jars of several shapes and many sizes; household baskets and plaques, never decorated, often covered with pitch onthe inside, always shallow; more or less cylindrical baskets with geometric designs in martynia, rarely painted bluish, red or white on the outside; the same with bail-like handles; great conical carrying baskets, sparingly decorated; small plaques, finer work, splints dyed; baby boards, and fanciful shapes. These are coiled on the rod and splint foundation and resemble Apache. Basketry terms are:
Wi-uat we-se-ma, prepared root of yucca, of brownish-red color.
Ma-k-tu-na, red roots of a little plant on the mountains.
K-he-é, or K-he-e-he-vah, reeds used for vertical ribs, also white or ereen fiber,
Ma-tha-kigh, reed for making baby boards, hoods, also for warps of baskets. An example was collected by Dr. Hrdlicka, ornamented with triangles and crenelated lines in pink and black.
The Mohave Indians (Yuman family) do not make baskets, but obtain them from other tribes, and examples will be found in every house. They obtain their rabbit-skin robes, done in twined weaving, from Paiutes (Shoshonean family) and Walapai (Yuman family). The Mohaves make constant use of the wrapped weaving. (See page 231, and Plate 17.)
The Chemehuevi are Shoshonean linguistically, and are now located

on the Colorado River Agency, Arizona. They make coiled baskets, The foundation is a rod and the sewing is done with willow or other splints, maybe cottonwood, The black figures are in the pods of martynia. Only two colors are used; frequently, however, feathers are introduced under the stitehes. They are the most tastefully made and the most beautiful baskets in that whole region. Catalogue No, 211028 is a Chemehueyi plaque in the National Museum collected by Captain Paul B. Carter, U.S. A. The ornamentation consists in a black center and two bands done in martynia pod. The surface is covered with a network of rhombs. Plate 232 is a collection of Chemehueyi plaques and jars in coiled weaving now in the U.S. National Museum. Especial attention is called to the purely geo metric figures on the surface, star, toothed lines, rhombs in bands, crenelated and serrated lines in great variety. In the central figure the middle band recalls the design, a modification of which becomes the well-known flying butterfly pattern. (See Plate 195.)
The tribes of the Piman family are in two groups, the northern, including Opata, Papago, and Pima proper; and the southern, including Cahita, Cora, Tarahumara, and Tepeguana, wholly confined to Mexico. By many scholars the Piman family would be made part of the great Uto-Aztecan.
The Piman basketry is unmistakable. The foundation is of split cat-tail stems (Zypha angustifolia) and the sewing is with willow (Salix nigra) and pods of martynia, but the
stitches are so fine and the work so uniform Cat. No. 76047, U.S.N.M. Collected by Edward Palmer,

that the surface is not ragose but smooth. The Pima decoration is the exuberance of fretwork. Inthe National Museum are many old pieces brought home by Army officers. Edward Palmer also collected many, and recently Dr. Frank Russell has enriched the collections with material which will be the subject of a special monograph. Coiled work without foundation finds application among the Pima in the network which supports their gourd receptacles. (See fig. 198.)
It has been said that basket making was introduced among the Pima one hundred years ago, when the Maricopa sought shelter among them from the slaughter of the Yuma. At that time the Pima made pottery only. On the other hand, the Maricopa allowed basket making to fall into disuse, and now make pottery only. Both Pima and Papago make matting in twilled work, and also carrying frames coyered with rude coiled lace.

They had no pails or vessels of wood, but were not slow to invent. They therefore took willows, which grow in abundance along the river, and a reed, and stripped the bark, then very adroitly split these with their teeth and wove them so closely together as to hold water. This they accomplished by means of needles or thorns of cactus, of which there are over one hundred varieties in this territory. They used these baskets while digging small ditches, the women filling them with earth and carrying them up the bank.“

The base is attached to a hoop by a string of agave fiber, with which the hoop is served; the bag is decorated with fretted work painted black and red.

Where the sticks enter the bag the hoop is tied to them by a cord of black horsehair; these also serve to tie the load in the basket. Near the bottom a small brace of wood is passed through the meshes of the bag and in front of the sticks on either side, to give it additional strength. A piece of matting of split reeds, 16 by 7 inches, is attached to the back of the basket to protect the body of the carrier; a pad of cloth is placed between the basket and matting for the same purpose.
A strong cord of twisted agave fiber, 3 feet long, is looped around the vertex; the ends passed along the posterior sticks, outside the bag, are fastened to the sticks by a loop of fiber. Above, the ends are attached to the forehead band, woven from the softened fiber of the Yucca baccata; it is double, and 7 inches long and 2 inches wide.

few most simple elements and easy of construction. Four series of vertical lines start from the black bottom. At uniform distances from the beginning all the way out to the rim horizontal lines proceed to the left, terminating in small black squares. It can easily be seen that, while the vertical lines are narrow and depend upon the width of the stitches, the horizonal lines must necessarily be as wide as the rows of sewing. About two-thirds of the way from the beginning a new set of zigzags are started, and these are continued to the outer margin.

Plate 234 represents two Pima basket bowls in the U.S. National Museum, collections of the Bureau of Ethnology, by Dr. Frank Russell. The foundation, sewing, and border are the same as in other examples. This plate is introduced for the purpose of showing how the basket maker works out aseries of concentric figures whose elements are straight lines mixed with segments of circles. The lower figure is based on a cirele in black from which four points project. The concentric rings are based upon this fundamental figure absolutely. From the points segments of circles increase in length as they proceed outward. From the concave quarter of the central figure circular segments decrease in length as they proceed
outward and the ends of Fig. 202. COILED BOWL:
these two sets of segments are connected by ragged straight lines. Finally the spaces at the four quarters on the rim are filled with small triangles in black. Could anything be more artistic than this association of the simplest elements in basket weaving?
The upper figure is on the same sort of foundation, only concentric segments alternate with series of rectangles arranged in checker patterns. These rectangles are all the same size, and are based on the four quarters projecting from the black circle. The widening of the pattern is all accomplished by the lengthening of the circular seoments.”

shredded fiber of cat-tail (typha latifolia). The sewing is in splints of willow, the stitches passing over the foundation and interlocking with those underneath. The sewing material is somewhat rigid so that the stitches are not pressed home, and the foundation shows between. Many of the stitches are split in the sewing, but it does not appear that it is systematically done for the purpose of ornamentation, as is the case with the Salish and Klikitat tribes of the farther north. The designs are in splints of martynia pod. The elements of decoration are in threes and, doubtless, have symbolic meanings, but these are not known. Diameter, 114 inches; height, 34 inches.

The foundation is a bundle of wheat straw averaging about half an inch in diameter, The sewing is done in willow bark, the strips varying in width from a quarter to half an inch. No attempt is made to crowd the sewing material so as to hide the foundation; indeed, this would be impossible because of the width of the

willow bark. The effect on the surface is to produce almost perpendicular lines from the center to the border. New rows are added as the coils enlarge.
The Pima Indians live partly on vegetable diet, the fruit of the ‘mesquit and of other plants, and they use the granary baskets on platforms for the purpose of keeping the dried material out of the way of rodents.

Plate 235 represents a Pima basketmaker. The Piman family have been supposed to be the connecting link between the Shoshonean of the Great Interior Basin and the Aztec or Nahuatl family of Mexico. In their present situation, however, they are cut off from the northern Shoshonean by the extension of the Yuman family.
This genius led the souls first to cloths, and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by the hand.—PLATO’s REPUBLIC.
On the border line between the Republic of Mexico and the United States is a transition between the standard forms which have hitherto been studied and the more open types of lace work and loom work. Coiled basketry of well-known varieties continues on southward, both in the lowlands and in the mountainous regions to within a few miles of the City of Mexico. Variations from these types are also in evidence, both coiled and twined, the former predominating. Foundations of grass more than an inch thick are built into immense baskets for carrying and also granaries, the sewing being done with wide strips of bark, wood, and leaves. Taking these coarse baskets for a motive, smaller and finer ones are done in better material, but still the stitches are half aninchapart. There is no occasion for surprise in this, since the linguistic families which are represented in Arizona, New Mexico, and California are also continued into the Republic of Mexico. In this area the student is clearly ‘* within the revolution of the spindle.” In addition to the coiled work just mentioned will be found coiling of the hammock type, and, interesting to know, the Chippewa on Lake Superior and the Loucheux type on the Mackenzie River are here reproduced in the varrying basket (see fig. 106). Starting out from very plain, coarse varieties of this work, it passes on into the lace-work burden baskets of the Pima, Papago, and Mohave. The figures wrought into these lace-work baskets are the same as are to be seen in the labyrinthian patterns on the basket bowls of the Pima. Quite as interesting as any of these types, the wrapped weaving before described is found in burden baskets of the Mohave. It must be recalled at this point,

<<<Page: 557>>>

however, that Hudson mentions the same style of workmanship among the Pomo Indians for roof building and traps, and W. H. Holmes brought from California a framework for carrying birds in which the rods are held in place by a similar wrapping. There is also in the National Museum an old coarse mortar basket made of sticks which are bound together in the same way. <A great deal of twilled and wicker work comes from the neighborhood of the City of Mexico and from Central America, and a species of coiled sewing which exists sporadically all the way from the Arctic Sea to Magellan Straits. The stitch, in addition to passing around the foundations to hold them together, also makes a wrapabout the standing part between the coils. Modern coiled ware in great quantities is made up from agave fiber of fine quality, but it resembles African work more than American. A variety of forms and uses exist in baskets in Mexico; among others, the immense hats. The Caribs on the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua are said to have plaited a pretty water-tight basket of reeds, called ** patapee,” but these people had bees in touch with natives of Africa, who knew how to make water-tight baskets from the time of Moses at least. The Tlaxcala Indians used twined weaving in making slings. Types of work just mentioned continue on into the Central American States. No account is here made of the fine weaving and needlework, in which typical and extraordinary patterns are wrought, because they are across the boundary line and are no longer in the family of basketry made merely by hand without machinery.
Twined basketry and matting are preserved in the Peabody Museum from prehistoric burial caves in Coahuila, Mexico; among the Tlaxcala Indians (Nahuatlan family) in Central Mexico; from prehistoric graves at Ancon, Peru, and Arica, Chile; from graves at Pisaqua, Chile; from the Guatos Indians (Tapuyan family), in southern Brazil, and from the Cadioes Indians (Guaycuruan family), on the Paragua River. (C. C. Willoughby.)
Plate 236, U.S. National Museum, was brought by Frank Russell from the Yaqui Indians of northern Mexico. It is in the form of the so-called ‘* telescope trunk,” and old specimens of the National Museum were collected many years ago by Edward Palmer. The material is a kind of rush, and the weaving is in twilled work. Such baskets are employed for holding all sorts of useful articles, but especially in connection with religious practices they are the depository of charms and fetish objects.
Plate 237, in the collection of Dr. A. Hrdlicka, shows two covered baskets bandbox shaped. They are made of palim-leaf strips in twilled weaving. Hundreds of these objects are woven of various sizes, and packed in nests, and are the common receptacle for all sorts of articles among the Yaqui. Especial attention is called to the lower basket, since itis an excellent example of what has been mentioned several times in this work—namely, double weaving. Strips of palm leaf are worked

<<<Page: 558>>>

in the pairs, the upper side of the leaf being outermost. At any moment, however, these strips may be separated and each member of the pair do service for warp or weft separately.
The Yaqui of Sonora, Mexico, says Palmer, split the stems of arundinaria for basketry by pounding them carefully with stones. The reeds divide along the lines of least resistance into splints of varying width, which are assorted and used in different textures. They now manufacture to order floor mats, porch screens, and the like, and sell them in Guaymas.
The Huichole Indians, living in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, belong to the -Aztecan branch of the great Shoshonean family. They have been described by Lumholtz, and are living in a state of native simplicity. They make a basket 2 or 3 feet long and only 6 inches in height with a similar cover. The material is palm leaf and the technic is twilled weaving. Similar baskets are woven by the Tarahumara (Piman), State of Chihuahua, and also by the Tepeguanos (Piman) in Durango, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Jalisco. These low, tray-shaped, rectangular baskets with covers are the common packing cases among these tribes mentioned of northern Mexico. (IHrdlicka.)
A wicker basket from Santa Maria del Rio, 14 leagues south of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, is Catalogue No. 76925, U. S. National Museum, made from the prepared stems of willow. The weaving is not after the fashion of the common market basket, but its parts are worked spirally in such manner that the smaller ends of the stems terminate in a braided band around the top of the body. (Compare fig. 190.) This arrangement reminds one of Dr. Matthews’s Study in Butts and Tips.“ The warp consists of groups of fine stems arranged in fours. As the bottom is oblong, five of the groups pass straight across it widthwise, while at the ends others radiate from the foci of the ellipse. The weft of the bottom is formed by means of fourteen stems, seven of which run in one direction and seven in the other, the smaller ends being fastened off on the border. The body is built up in the same way. In the ordinary wicker basket a stem is woven among the warps, and when the end is reached another stem takes its place, and so on; but in this example all the weft stems of the body begin at the very bottom and are wound in a spiral up to the upper margin. At this border the warp stems are all bent to the right for an inch and a half and then turned back again, being intertwined in a sort of openwork diagonal weaving. To form the handle seven stems on each side are thrust between the weft, and these bundles are wrapped about each other to form the twisted handle, the smaller ends being deflected so that the ends of the stems which form the body and the ends of the handle and the stems of the body are all woven together to form the braid-work at the top.

H. Ling Roth, in his paper on the aborigines of Hispaniola,” says that although none of the histories make reference to the island in which baskets were manufactured, nor even to the material out of which they are made, there is occasional mention of them, proving that formerly, as now, the Caribs and their tribes knew how to weave basket work. The Spaniards both in Hispaniola and Cuba on several occasions found men’s heads cut off and sewed up with great care in small baskets. He quotes Benzoni in speaking of a feast in which baskets were adorned with roses and various flowers. Columbus found baskets in Guadeloupe full of men’s bones.
A glance at the map of northern South America shows how easy it is to pass from the Windward Islands up the Orinoco and over the drainage of the Rio Negro, down to the Amazon. On this central position it is not difficult to make communication with the highlands of middle Brazil, Bolivia, eastern Peru, and Ecuador, and to pass from the Xingu River to Paraguay is easy. This explanation will clear the way for the collection of baskets now to be described.
The seventieth parallel from Greenwich may be used to divide South America into east and west basketry sub-areas. The West Indies will be counted with the eastern portions. The few widespread linguistic families serve as a bond to hold the tribes in mind. At the extreme north the Carib and the Arawak are conspicuous; the Tupi-Guarani and the Geez answer for Brazil; over the Amazon watershed, the La Plata areas, the Gran Chaco tribes follow. Patagonia and Fuegia complete the series. Over a large portion of this eastern region the types of weaving practiced in the Southern States of the Union prevail. On the western side of the continent, in the Andean valleys, the basketry is more varied and interesting, as the description and illustrations will show. The information which follows is far from complete. The little which is said will serve at least as a starting point and show that aboriginally and technically there was only one America.
Plate 238 shows an Indian woman standing in front of the agave>
plant—a fitting combination, since in Mexico, Central America, and northern portions of South America the agave is to the native population an enduring friend. In modern industries it has not lost its influence. The lechiguilla, ixtl, sisal, and other standard fibers are therefrom. In old times it was the substance from which receptacles, clothing, parts of household utensils and conveniences, and many other useful things were made. The figure standing in front of the plant might be called the Clotho of the agave, whose skillful fingers will turn the ideal plant into many supplies of wants.

The specimens in the National Museum are all of the twilled pattern, wrought from a brown vegetable fiber which shows the same on both sides. This twill is used with good effect in the diagonally woven cassava strainers, widely distributed, which may be contracted in length by a corresponding increase of width. When the cassava is packed into this strainer the latter is suspended and a great weight fastened to the bottom. The same device is used among us by country housewives in making curds. There is anentire lack of gaudy dyes in the Guiana baskets, the only colors being the natural hue of the wood and a jet-black varnish. The gorgeous plumage of the birds replace the dyes in ornamentation. (See Plate 239.)
The material used for basket work among the Indians of Guiana is the split stem of a kind of maranta (/schnosiphon) called iturite by the Indians. For rough work other species of iturite are used, and for the roughest of all the unsplit stems of certain creepers, especially one called by the Indians mamamoorie (Carludovica plumiert:).
The so-called pegalls (packalls) are square generally. The basket and lid are the same shape; the latter, being larger, slips over the former and entirely covers it. Many Caribs made their pegalls of an oblong shape, with gracefully curved lines, and adorn them with long strings of thick, white cotton on which are knots of colored feathers. Sometimes the true Caribs make the pegall and lid double, and between the two layers of basket work certain leaves (/schnosiphon) are inserted to make the whole waterproof. Here is another example of double warp noted in several parts of North America.
Another basket, shaped like a slipper, is the suriana, for carrying heavy loads. This useful form has a wide distribution, being seen in Guatemala. The ‘‘quake,” another basket, is used for storing provisions. They also serve as cages. It is made of open wicker work with a rounded bottom. Most of the baskets are manufactured in the same way and of the same material. The Nikari karus, living on the Brazilian borders, make their pegalls of the leaves of the palm (Orbigna), very rare in British Guiana. These are square or oblong.“
Plates 240 and 241 are from photographs presented by the distinguished ethnologist, Carl yon den Steinen. They represent carrying baskets from eastern Brazil in the collection of the Berlin Ethnographic Museum. In order to bring the structure into comparison, baskets of the same function were selected. The following descriptions, aided by the photographs, will make plain the structure.
Plate 240, fig. 1, is a carrying basket (hasiri) of the Jamamadi Indians, living on the Rio Purus, in the collection of Paul Ehrenreich. The warp is crossed and the weft passes through the warp in regular order, so as to produce hexagonal openings. The border is formed

by simply turning over the ends of the w arp and weaving them backward. The head strap is a wide strip of inner bark. Prof. J. B. Steere collected for the U.S. National Museum a fine specimen of this same type of weaving of the Jamamadi, resembling, in fact, fig. 2 of this plate. (See Plate 95, fig. 5.)
Fig. 2 is a carrying basket (shibati) of the Hypurina Indians, living on the Rio Purus, collected by Paul Ehrenreich. The warp is crossed and the weaving is done as in fig. 1, but there are twice as many weft splints, the hexagonal spaces being crossed by them. The border is formed by a hoop of wood. Strips are attached to the side of the basket for strength, and string loops at the top for attachment of the head band, which is in tough inner bark of a tree, as in No.
Fig. 3 is a carrying basket (koho) from the Paressi Indians, on the upper Tapajoz River, Brazil, in the collection of Dr. Carl yon den Steinen. This is an elegant piece of work and worthy of study. Onehalf of the warp elements are vertical and the other inclined. The weft passes through the interstices formed by the crossed warp in twos and threes. At the top a hoop is used for strengthening; the warp turned back and held firm by a single row of three-strand weay ing. On the sides a rope is attached to the weft elements for loops and the headband is made, as in the other specimens, from the tough inner bark of a tree.
Fig. isa children’s carrying basket (mayaku) of the Bakatri Indians, on the upper Xingu River, Brazil, and fig. 5 an example for adults by the same tribe, from the collection of Dr. yon den Steinen. They are made of four elongated hoops of wood. One furnishes the bed or bottom of the frame, two others the sides, and the smaller one the end. Those who are accustomed to studying utensils used in transportation will recognize in these two frames African forms. They are not basket work, either of them, in the strict sense of the word, since the webbing which fills up the hoops is true network of string; the crossings form regular knots. In both examples the headband is of bast, or the inner bark of a tree, and in the larger be binding of the wares is in the same material.
Plate 241, fig. 1, is a carrying basket (kodrabo) of the Borord Indians, on the Rio Sao Lourengo, Brazil, in the collection of Dr. von den Steinen. It is in palm leaf, in regular twilled weaving common throughout the world. The interesting portion, which ought not to be ov Brlocked: is the border, which is the midrib of the palm leaf, with the leaflets attached. The ‘arrying band or headband, as in other examples, is in tough inner bark of a tree.

It is an elaborate specimen built on a framework with « round hoop at the top and two ox-bow shaped pieces of wood crossing under the bottom to give shape to the body. The upper part of the surface is in wicker work. A band around the middle in twilled weaving is ornamented with rhomboidal patterns and the lower part is also covered with wicker work. The headband is in tough bark.
Fig. 4 is a carrying basket (apoi) made by the Warrau Indians, on the Rio Orinoco-Cuyuni in Guiana. The framework and covering are interesting on account of the distribution of this peculiar form, which may be found as far north as Guatemala and around the Caribbean Sea. The work is in twilled weaying, and the border is formed by strips of wood sewed to the upper edge. The headband is in two-strand rope.

The detail is shown in fig. 206, and especial attention is called to the ornamental effect of using a two-ply twine and the additional decorative feature of having the twines in different colors.
The fibers of the Middle Americans and Mexicans are of the best kind and texture, and are used in hammocks and for the most exacting labor in transportation.
An interesting example of the friendly cooperation between the best material and the best workmen is to be found in the Republic of Ecuador in the manufacture of the so-called Panama hat. In Consular Report No. 821 Consul Perry M. de Leon gives the following

account of it: The Manavi (Panama) hat was first made in the province of Manavi, Ecuador, about two hundred and seventy-five years ago by a native named Francisco Delgado. The present centers of the industry are Monte Cristi and Jipijapa in the province of Manavi, and Santa Elena and Cuenca in the provinces of Guayas and Azuay, respectively. They came to be known as Panama hats years ago when that city was a distributing center. Those who are familiar with them can tell by the method of beginning the work at the center of the crown the locality where the work isdone. In Ecuador, Colombia, and Central America the hat is known to the natives as the Jipijapa (pronounced hipi-hapa), but as they are made elsewhere in Ecuador, principally in the province of Manavi, and as the name is easy to pronounce, it might take the place of the present misleading appellation. (See Plate 242.)
They are made froma native species of palin (Carludovica palmata). It is cultivated in the provinces of Manavi and Guayas and is known as *Spaja toquilla.” In appearance it resembles very much our saw palmetto; it is fan-like in shape. Low-lying wet land is selected and the seed planted in rows during the rainy season. When the plant attains a height of 45 or 5 feet it is cut just before ripening. ‘The leaves are boiled in hot water and after being thoroughly sun dried are assorted and ready for use.
The material is first carefully selected, dampened to make it pliable, then very finely divided into requisite widths, the little finger and thumb nail being used for the purpose. The very finest specimens are prepared from delicate leaves that need no splitting or stiffening. The plaiting begins at the apex of the crown and is continued in circular form until the hat is finished. The story that they are made under water by candle light is untrue. The work is carried on while the atmosphere is humid, from about midnight to 7 o’clock in the morning. At night the hat is hung out in the open air so that the dew may fall upon it, and it is then in position to be worked the next day. If the strand breaks it can be replaced and so plaited so as not to affect the work nor be visible to the naked eye. The ingenious woman uses her knee for a head block. This antedates all modern appliances for giving shape to head gear. It requires from three to five months daily labor of three hours a day to make one of the finest hats. The business in its highest development is really an art, requiring patience, fine sight, and special skill—qualifications few of the natives possess. The plaiting completed, the hat is washed in clean, cold water, coated with a thin solution of gum, and polished with dry powdered sulphur. They are so pliable that they can be rolled up without injury and put in one’s pocket. They will last for years and can be repeatedly cleaned.
Natives of both sexes and all ages are engaged in this work at odd times, the business being a side issue. Children make from raw, undressed straw about two of the common hats a day.

<<<Page: 565>>>

The specimen here shown is in the collection of Dr. S. O. Richey, of Washington City, and has 20 or more crossings to the linear inch. The hats vary from the ordinary form having 18 crossings or checks to the finest quality, which have twice as many. In the market they are sold at from $10 to $150. The most costly specimens are those in which there is not a break in the straw, mismatched color, or a knot showing in the work.
During the nineteenth century the cemeteries of Peru yielded the greatest abundance of relics and remains. Among the former were a mixed variety of textiles, which were types of basketry hereafter to be described. The climate of Peru is arid and almost a desert like that of Arizona or Egypt. The frail products of the textile industry that might have perished utterly in North America almost everywhere have here all been preserved. Fine specimens of old Peruvian work are to be seen in all the leading museums of the world. The Field Columbian in Chicago is especially rich in productions of this kind, gathered through the agency of the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.
In the Peabody Museum and in the U.S. National Museum also are fine old collections brought home fifty years ago by earlier travelers and explorers in South America, and in this Peruvian basketware are to be seen not only great varieties in form and exhaustive treatment of native technical processes but adaptations to uses without number extending literally from the cradle to the grave.
The name Peru has for the ethnologist a long perspective in time, reaching through many centuries; in elevation it covers the range of habitable areas from reeking seacoasts to heights barely endurable by man. In coast line it stretches through 15 degrees of south latitude (5° to 20°). Only in width is it restricted to the narrow watershed of the Andes and a slight portion of the incline on the eastern side, reaching down to the forest line. The most celebrated of the explorations in this area have been by Reiss, Stiibel, and Koppel.“
These authors figure the following-named types of basketry:
1. Checkerwork: In this connection should be noted a kind of openwork in which the warps are set at an angle of 45 degrees, running in two directions, forming diamond-shaped spaces. A weft passes around among these warps so as to divide the diamond-shaped spaces into triangles. Such weaving is seen in many specimens of the North Pacific area; even the Aleutian islanders practice it. It has been already described and figured in von den Steinen’s plates for the eastern area.
2. Wickerwork, in Colombia and Uruguay.
3. Diagonal or twilled work, widely diffused.
4. Twined work has been recovered from prehistoric graves at Ancon, Peru, in matting, both coarse and fine, and on baskets; from

prehistoric graves at Arica, Chile, in the structure of small wallets of basketry; and from graves at Pisagua, Chile, in baskets. On other styles of manufacture a row or two intrudes itself.
5. Coiled work without foundation is universally distributed. With foundation of fine splints it occurs also as will be seen.“
In the plates of these authors the following-named technical processes will be seen:

Figs. 207 to 211 are twilled basketry found deposited with the dead in a cemetery at Ancon, Peru. They are made of rushes and exhibit a ereat variety of forms, as may be seen by examining the drawings on the

cover of fig. 207. Across the middle are two rows of ordinary overtwo twilled weaving, seen also in detail in fig. 208. A noticeable feature on other specimens, however, to which attention is drawn by Holmes¢ and to which he gives the name diagonal combination, is the production of triangular figures. The weaver in going from rene to left. produces the effect of right-angle triangles, but in returning so regulates the decussations of the fibers as to give to the pairs of tri-

angles of the two rows acommon hypothenuse. The effect of this combination is magical, leaving the impression of high relief. (Fig. 209.)
But the most charming effects in these Peruvian workbaskets are brought about by the use of narrow strips of wood, over which the plaiting takes place and by which broad bands of twilled work are produced. This result is manifest in figs. 210 and 211.
Another characteristic of this Peruvian work is the hinging of the cover of the basket as part of the weaving. In Plate 243, evidently the workbasket of an ancient spinner in Vicufia wool, there is a single cover, but it will be seen that the modern compartment trunk has been anticipated, the basket being in three divisions, the middle one forming the cover of the lower one. The detail of the hinge as a part of the texture may be seen in the small drawings at the bottom of the plate.
Plate 244 is a twined carrying frame from the graves of Iquique, southern Peru. The framework consists of three sticks, bent in the shape of an oxbow, crossing each other at the bottom so as to give to

the top the form of an oblique hexagon. The ends are held in place by a stout cord of hair in natural brown color. The warp of this basket is formed by winding a white string round and round these sticks on the outside, about one-eighth of an inch apart, from the bottom to the top. The weft is a series of vertical rows of twined weaving, in some places close together and in others wide apart, for ornamental effect. The vertical stripes seen on the surface are in ereen, red, black, and white, twined, and in twined weaving, each block including two or more warp strands. By using two colors in the twine the patterns are variegated on the surface, first the white and then the colored strand coming into view. By comparing these specimens with the one from the Arikara Indians, fig. 125, it will be seen that in the latter two of the bows projected downward and formed the bottom, on which the basket rests. But in this case no such protection is afforded. The woman has sewed a coarse piece of woven stuff along the bottom

as a protection of the more delicate threads. The specimen is in the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, and the colored plate was furnished by Dr. George A. Dorsey.
Fig. 212 is a fragment of a coiled basket from a copper mine in the district of Chuquicamata in the desert of Atacama, Chile. It was found, together with other industrial implements, associated with the body of a» woman who undoubtedly met her death on the spot. From the dislocated backbone and the small stones embedded in the skin, it is supposed that she was buried by a caving in of the works. The basket of which this is a fragment, was in every respect similar to the Pima ware in southern Arizona. This fragment bears such remarkable similarity to Pima workmanship that J. W. Benham, of Arizona, who is most familiar with it, was struck with the Chilean example and wondered whether it were possible that the Pima Indians and the Chileans could have been under the same instructors.

<<<Page: 569>>>

Plates 245 to 247 are also specimens of coiled work exhibited in the Pan-American Exposition, with the mummy from Chile; the foundation of the coil of shredded material and the sewing also in soft splints. The stitches pass over the foundation and are not only interlocking but take up a portion of the foundation in its base below. These should be compared with the specimens from northern Mexico in the Peabody Museum, described by C. C. Willoughby.
Plate 248 is the side and bottom view of a coiled basket from Peru. The style is entirely modern, but it is introduced here to show two features in technic well wrought out in the northern continent. The foundation and the sewing are both ina brilliant-colored straw, species unknown. Sewing is reduced to the minimum, most of the foundation being neatly wrapped, or served with the sewing material. The stitches on the body are bifurcated most neatly, and coming one above the other give the impression of herringbone work done vertically. Finding this openwork coil and furcate stitches in Eskimo land, California, and Peru would tempt one to see the same invention arising independently in regions wide apart; but, omitting the unlimited going about in pre-Columbian times, during hundreds of years the sovereigns of Spain, France, England, and for a century Russia mixed the native tribes and their industries. Catalogue No. 150844, U.S. National Museum.
The two areas of South America, eastern and western, unite in the Straits of Magellan. There are three linguistic families of Indians, among whom two types of basketry are found belonging to the coiled variety. They are made by women of Juncus magellanicus. Descriptions and figures of the stitches involved will be found in the Revue (VEthnographie.“ See also Lovisto.? The rim is made of wood veya or tshelia. ‘The specimens in the U. S$. National Museum are all of one variety, the sewing being in the buttonhole stitch, so called, and in openwork. Nothing of the kind exists in the neighborhood, so that it is within the limits of possibility that the style of technic was introduced.
In summing up what has been said on basketry in the Western Hemisphere it would seem that all the types and processes known throughout the world are to be seen here.
VIII. COLLECTORS AND COLLECTIONS As David and the Sibyl say—THOMAS OF CELANO,
Basketry and pottery are the Sibylline leaves on which are written the thoughts and lore of our Indians. Already much has gone beyond recovery; it is for this reason that a good word is here spoken for those lovers of art who have spent time and means in redeeming the
@Paris, IV, p. 517. > Guida Cora’s Cosmos, October, 1884, pl. v.

<<<Page: 570>>>

more perishable of the two treasures from destruction. Pottery may be broken, but its fragments endure and bear witness. Not so basketry, made of the most perishable portions of plants, it can endure only when in contact with preservative materials, or partly reduced to ashes, or deposited in caves and other dry places, or finally, their technic but not their story may be saved by impressions left on pottery.
The following instructions are published for the great number of persons who are interested in the collection and preservation of American basketry. Besides the wsthetic elements involved and the pride of saving the best examples of a rapidly vanishing industry, there is a vast deal of culture study which ought not to be neglected.
In every collection, public or private, there are opportunities for special investigation that should not be in the possession of a single individual only. If all who are gathering baskets would preserve such information as they may be able to obtain, the bringing together of the results of all this study would be a monument for our American aboriginal women.
As pointed out in former chapters, knowledge concerning basketry seems to be illimitable, the technician, the artist, and the student of folklore finding equal pleasure in the acquisition. To begin with the manufacture, a correct knowledge of the materials includes the name of the tribe and their location, the name of the different kinds of weaving in the native tongue, and chiefly, the native name, the common name, and the scientific name of every plant or animal substance or mineral involved. The reason for this is that in order to know whether an art is indigenous or acquired, if is necessary to compare the names for definite things with those used by other tribes for the same things. Not to discourage the collector, however, it must be said that this is an ideal toward which he ought to work.
The following label of a specimen in the Hudson basketry collection, U.S. National Museum, will serve as a model to guide the collector in saving information about his specimens:
BASKET JAR of the Pomo Indians (Kulanapan family). Made from the prepared root of Kahum, or California sedge (Carex barbarae), throat and scalp feathers of Katéteh, or woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus), breast feathers of Jucil, or meadow lark (Sturnella neglecta), scalp feathers of Kayan, or mallard (Anas borehas), plumes of Tehikdéka, or crested quail (Lophortyx californicus), neck feathers of Tsawdlu, or jay (Cyanura stelleri), and Kéya, or prepared clam shell (Saxidomus gracilis), in a style of coiled sewing ealled Tsai, in which a single roa constitutes the basis. The sewing passes over this rod, under the preceding one, and locks
in the stitch immediately underneath. Ornamentation, a row of shell disks around the margin and another row serving as a handle.

For the artistic collector there is a very important mission, to know and to foster the aboriginal patterns and motives in decoration. Many of the shapes and designs in basketry are spurious. Besides the trashy imitations of letters and common things on basketry, which mislead no one, there is an important habit springing up of getting women of one tribe to imitate the designs of another tribe. This works confusion in two ways. It confounds the student of folklore absolutely, and if there be any truth in the belief that in all art the material and the motif have in the ages adapted themselves to each other ‘* like perfect music unto perfect words,” the attempt to put Apache ornaments on Pima, or Wasco on Klikitat is discordant.
The art of a people must be judged by what they need not do and yet accomplish.—A. C. HADDON,
Textiles are among the most fragile and perishable of human industrial products. Insects and rust, heat and cold, too much and too little moisture, the common accidents of life, are hastening our pretty baskets to their dissolution. Therefore, how to prolong the life of a basket is a living question with all basket lovers, and the answer will be easier if the causes of destruction are known. The three enemies of baskets are moth and rust and human fingers. By the moth are meant all destructive animals; by rust, natural decay; and in the last agency must be classed the myriad ways by which our fellowcreatures purloin and destroy our treasures. E. $8. Morse tells us that the Japanese do not make of their houses bazaars for the ostentatious display of art objects, but they put them away in silk bags to bring forth when they wish to delight their friends. Those collections that have been made with a view to permanence should be kept so that they will suffer least from damage. The dust may be blown from the specimens with bellows. Those containing remnants of vegetable matter, berries, food, etc., should be carefully scrubbed with soap and water, and rubbed down with a very small portion of oil and dryer. Above all they should be poisoned with a weak solution of corrosive sublimate or arsenic dissolved in alcohol. A card catalogue giving the legend and history of each piece would add much to the value of the collection.
A list of collections of rarities in American basketry is here appended, by no means complete, but it will aid the student who wishes to prosecute his investigations further to find the material. First of all, in the great museums there are permanently in store priceless examples of basketry, and in addition many costly collections belonging to private individuals, have thus rendered a great service to this writer. It is interesting to read over the names of the men and women who long ago contributed to the great museums precious examples of uncontaminated Indian art.

Nationat Museum.—The Museum is rich in collections of American basketry made to show all forms of technic and also to exhibit handiwork from tribes in the six areas. Beginning at the north, the collections of Ray from Point Barrow; of McFarlane and Ross at the Mackenzie mouth; the rich treasures gathered by Nelson in western Alaska; those of Dall, Turner, Applegate, and Fisher further south; and the Tlinkit ware selected by McLean, Swan, and Emmons amply illustrate the technical processes in that area.
Going southward, the Salish and other Fraser-Columbia basketry includes among others Wilkes, Swan, Eells, Shackleford, Emmons, and Willoughby collections.
The largest collections from California were made by Purcell, Ray, Stone, Powers, Hudson, Henshaw, Curtin in the north; by Holmes, Merriam, Rust, and Mead in the south.
The collections of basketry from the Interior Basin are the largest of all, being gathered by Palmer, Powell, Cushing, Stevenson, Holmes, Fewkes, Hough, Mooney, and Russell, and officers connected with the numerous surveys. Much of this is very old. From further south, from Middle and South America, the Museum is indebted to explorers and officers of various departments of the Goyernment for typical material, the latest gathered on.the Amazon by J.

The following list of publications will help to follow up this study in special lines. A great awakening of interest in the processes of savage industries as the foundation of all modern machine work has stimulated the production of excellent books and papers on basketry. At the moment of going to press the author of this general treatise learns of several. Dr. P. E. Goddard, of the University of California, was so good as to lend his proof on the Hupas; Frank Russell on the Pimas had not appeared; Emmons on the Tlinkit, and Dixon and Kroeber’s further studies on California basketry were not in print.

EXGRIEANAT NON Ole Pi SAgisEeiGn
A sak-lotks’ p’a/-hla or flexible gambling tray of the Klamath Indians of Oregon. Both warp (pa-chish’) and weft (twach) are of cords of undyed twisted tule (p. 211), which are fully exposed only in the pale-brown stripe at the margin, where the ends of the warp are interlaced and bound with a strengthening cord of gray fiber from the nettle ( Urtica breweri), slédsh. Every other stitch of the tray is covered by an overlaying material: the white is of reed (p. 208); the black (mok’-was) is of tule dyed in mud springs containing iron; the canary yellow is of porcupine quills (smai’-am ) dyed with wolf moss (p. 205), and the brown of the ring near the center of the tray is of undyed tule. Nettle cord was used in binding the strands of warp together at the beginning.
The main trefoil pattern is of unknown significance. The triangles upon it are bird-wing patterns (slas-al’-tIs), while the triangles on the marginal design are arrowhead patterns (sa’-wal-sal’-tis). The brown and black ring near the center is an op’-k’a, a name applied only to a ring of transversely alternating colors. A ring of uniform color would be a smél-6/-g’a.

By LreoNHARD STEJNEGER,
Curator, Division of Reptiles and Batrachians.
The present account of the herpetology of Porto Rico is based primarily upon the collections recently accumuiated in the United States National Museum, consisting of about 900 specimens.
Of this large amount of material nearly 350 specimens were collected by Mr. A. B. Baker, of the National Zoological Park, who accompanied the U. S. Fish Commission expedition to Porto Rico during the early part of 1899, and the other naturalists then attached to the /7sh awh.“
About 540 specimens were secured in 1900 by Dr. C. W. Richmond and the present writer, who visited Porto Rico and Vieques from February 12 to April 19. This number includes various specimens collected then or shortly afterwards at our request by other persons, among whom may be mentioned Dr, A. Stahl, of Bayamon, Porto Rico; Mr. L. M. McCormick, of New York; Mr. B.S. Bowdish, of New York, and Mr. Charles E. Adams.
It may be added that the National Museum during 1901 employed Mr. B. S. Bowdish for several months in collecting in Porto Rico and Mona Island. The most important result was the discovery of a new species of Anolzs in Mona.
The trip which I undertook in conjunction with Dr. C. W. Richmond, Assistant Curator of Birds, was primarily for the purpose of collecting specimens characteristic of the West Indian fauna for exhibition at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. It was originally ourintention to proceed from Porto Rico to the smaller islands on the east and south, but an attack of fever to which we both fell victims prevented us from carrying out our plans. The fever and the long convalescence also seriously interfered with our work in Porto Rico, so that we lost nearly three weeks collecting.
aFor an account of this expedition see Dr. B. W. Evermann’s General Report on the Investigations in Porto Rico of the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk in 1899, in U. S. Fish Commission Bulletin for 1900, pp. 3-25. 553

<<<Page: 1097>>>

Our principal and most important collecting was made in the high and wet region of the El Yunque Mountain, near the eastern end of the island. There, at an altitude of 2,978 ¢ feet, only about 500 feet below the top, we camped for five days during an almost continuous rain and fog, while an equal length of time was spent on Mr. Agostini’s hospitable coffee plantation on the eastern slope of the same mountain, at an elevation of 886 feet. One of the first reptiles I collected there was a fine specimen of the large Anolis cuvier’, which seems to be quite rare. In the excessively moist climate near the top, in a tropical forest of palms and tree ferns covered with dripping moss and air plants, while a dense matting of wet begonias concealed the ground reeking with dampness, we collected a large number of tree toads, some of which turned out to be new species. Here also we saw the new species of Anolis, the gorgeously emerald green A. evermanni, in its greatest glory.
Another new species of Ano//s we discovered toward the end of our stay in the dry, southern part of the island, in fact, only 3 miles from Ponce, the most important commercial city of the island. The surface of the hills, which rise out of the coastal plain east of the city, is covered with a white, calcareous, marl-like formation, and here we found this species, Anolis poncensis, which belongs to the same group of the genus as A. pulchellus and A. krugi.
Some time was spent in Utuado in a diligent search for Peters’s Anolis gundlachi, the types of which, now in the museum at Berlin, are said to have been collected at Utuado. We secured only a single young specimen near that town, which is the lowest altitude in which the species seems to occur. In the higher regions of El Yunque and at Adjuntas we found it abundant.
That I only obtained one specimen of Celestus plet/, and that we, as well as Mr. Baker and others of the /7sh /Zawhk party, entirely failed to secure a single specimen of Juhuya sloanii is less extraordinary, for doubtless the scarcity of these purely terrestrial species is due to the mongoose, which now infests the whole island and in places is exceedingly common.
This ferocious little animal is also responsible for the present comparative infrequency of snakes in the island. Formerly snakes were common enough, for as late as 1835 Dr. Moritz found them so numerous that in places one could hardly make a step without seeing sev-
«My own aneroid measurements gave for our camp an altitude of 2,863 feet and for the top of El Yunque 3,351 feet. On the latest map of Porto Rico issued by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (No. 920, December, 1901) the height of El Yunque as obtained by triangulation is given as 1,062 meters, or 3,485 feet, consequently 134 higher than found by me. Accepting the latter altitude as correct, and distributing the error proportionally, the altitude of our camp may be assumed to have been 2,978 feet above sea level.

eral. At present one may traverse the island from one end to the other without getting a glimpse of a single one.
The apparent rarity of the toad (Bufo lemur) is probably due less to the mongoose than to its very retired habits and the scarcity of suitable localities. The name Sapo is known to the inhabitants, but in most places is misapplied to the Leptodacty/us and the tree toad. Some even knew the name Sapo concho, by which the Porto Rican toad is known speciticaily because of the shell-like hardness of the bony head covering, but no one seemed able to give us any information which would lead to its discovery. Even a large reward which I offered proved ineffective. Dr. Stahl, who, during a residence of more than forty years, had collected assiduously, and to whom the country people used to bring all the natural curiosities they could find, assured us that he himself had never seen the toad in its native haunts, and that altogether only six specimens had been brought him, so that our prospects of finding it were very slight. Mr. Baker and the Fish Commission party had also failed to obtain a single specimen. We were constantly watching for it, and nearly despaired of getting one but finally decided to spend some time in Arecibo as the most likely place for them to occur. Even here we were on the point of giving up our search for the now almost mythical animal, when on the last night of our stay there, after our baggage was packed for our departure the next morning, I became the happy possessor of five fine specimens, thanks to the zealous and intelligent assistance of Enrique L. Brascoechea, a young Porto Rican of Aguadilla, a United States telegraph operator, and at the time temporarily in charge of the telegraph office in Arecibo.
During this trip I paid special attention to the colors of the living reptiles and batrachians which I collected, and full descriptions were prepared with Ridgway’s Nomenclator of Colors in hand for reference. These descriptions will be found in the present account under their proper headings.
The figures illustrating this paper are mostly the work of Mr. Rk. G. Paine. A few have been drawn by Miss Sigrid Bentzon.
The author wishes to express his obligations to various persons who have assisted in accumulating the material at band, either directly by collecting part of it or indirectly by assisting him while in Porto Rico.
Thanks are particularly due to the authorities of the U.S. Fish Commission for the use of the magnificent collections made by the Fish Hawk expedition, and to Mr. A. B. Baker for the zeal and care displayed in getting together the finest collection of reptiles made up to that time in Porto Rico. Iam also under obligations to Mr. Louis McCormick, Mr. B. S. Bowdish, Mr. Charles E. Adams, and Dr. A. Stahl, for specimens collected by them in various parts of the island and presented to the National Museum.

<<<Page: 1099>>>

To Prof. Samuel Garman, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, I am greatly indebted for the loan of various specimens of Porto Rican reptiles.
To Dr. G. Pfeffer, curator in the Natural History Museum in Hamburg, Tam also greatly in debt for the opportunity to examine the Mona Island specimens under his care. Dr. Steinhaus, assistant at the same museum, rendered valuable help during this examination.
I wish specially to acknowledge the assistance received from the military authorities then in charge of the island. Col. John L. Clem, U.S. Army, the chief quartermaster, rendered material help in the matter of transportation, and Lieut. Col. William A. Glassford, U. 8. Army, the chief signal officer, has placed us under lasting obligations by his generous and thoughtful assistance in many ways.
Finally, I have to thank my associate, Dr. Charles We Richmond, for active help and cheerful companionship during an expedition which, though offering but little in the way of excitement and adventure, nevertheless was devoid neither of arduous work nor of hardships of various kinds and degrees.
The first attempt at an enumeration of the reptiles and batrachians of Porto Rico is by Mr. Ledru (as he is called on the title-page, or Le Dru, as his name is spelled throughout the book), who accompanied Captain Baudin in 1796 to 1798 on a scientific expedition to Teneriffa, Trinidad, St. Thomas, St. Croix, and Porto Rico, of which he published an account in two volumes in 1810 (see bibliography). The second volume contains what purports to be an account of the reptiles occurring in Porto Rico under the following names: (1) Lacerta monitor Gm., (2) Lacerta strumosa Gm., (3) Lacerta sputator Gm., (4) Lacerta iquana Gm., (5) Lacerta ameiva Gm, (6) Lacerta principalis Gin., (7) Lacerta rapicauda Gm., (8) Coluber colubella Gm., (9) Coluber melanocephalus Gm., (10) Boa murina Gmm., (11) Rana ocellata Lin.Gm., (12) Rana arborea Lin. var 2 Rana Americana rubra Seb., Gm.
This list is only less amusing than that of the birds and need not be taken seriously. Evidently Ledru, who was a botanist, did not bring home any reptilian specimens.¢ He probably made notes of some which he saw and of names which were given him on the island. Consequently it is not worth while to attempt any identification of his names, and no reference is made to them in the synonymies of the species in this paper. ‘To illustrate how worthless the whole account is I may quote his description of the boa, which evidently is meant to be the Epicrates ¢nornatus, a species nearly uniform grayish-brown
« Reptiles are not mentioned in the summary of the collections brought to France and deposited in the National Museum at Paris. Vol. II, p. 291.

<<<Page: 1100>>>

above and slate-gray beneath, but which according to Ledru has the “color on the back agreeably marbled with sea-green; pale and speckled with black on the belly.”
The next time we hear of Porto Rican reptiles is in a paper by Dr. C. Moritz,” who collected insects for the museum in Berlin during four months in the spring of 1835. On page 375 he presents a few general remarks on the reptiles, of no particular interest except that it appears from his account that snakes were much more numerous at that time than at present, for he speaks of places in which one scarcely could make a few steps without seeing several snakes. That he was not much of a herpetologist is evident from his reference to Cweilia, by which he apparently means either Zyphlops or Amphishena. ;
Long before this time, however, a certain Monsieur Plée had also visited Porto Rico, apparently on his way from New York to Martinique. He sent his specimens from the latter place to the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, where the reptiles without any discrimination were all credited to Martinique. Amph/shena cwea, Anolis eristatelus, Anolis pulchellus, and Celestus pledi belong to this category.
With the Danish Virgin Islands so near to Porto Rico, it was quite natural that spec.mens trom the latter should occasionally find their way to the museum in Copenhagen. Thus Reinhardt was enabled, in 1848, to describe the large boa as Boa /nornata. Later, Mr. Riise, an apothecary in St. Thomas, who collected extensively in the Danish islands, visited Vieques personally and sent a number of Porto Rican specimens about the same time to the Smithsonian Institution and to the museum in Copenhagen. The former came under the notice of Cope, and scattered references to them were made by him in 1862. In the following year Professor Reinhardt and Dr. Luetken published their admirable contributions to the herpetology of the West Indian Archipelago, particularly that of the Danish West Indian Islands (see Bibliography) in which the first list of Porto Rican reptiles and batrachians based on reliable material was published. The list was a very meager one, embracing only one batrachian,’ four snakes, five lizards, and two turtles, together eleven species, as follows:
1? Hylodes antillensis (Vieques). 2% Alsophis antillensis (Vieques). 3. Alsophis portoricensis.
4. Chilabothrus inornatus.
5. Lyphlops richardii.
@ Arch. Naturg., II, 1836, pp. 373-392.
In their tabular synopsis of West Indian species, Porto Rico is credited with one species of batrachians (Author’s separate, p. 7), though by an oversight the species is not indicated in the table. The only batrachian referred to in the text as belonging to Porto Rico is a young Hylodes from Vieques doubttully referred to H. antillensis (Author’s separate, p. 57).

<<<Page: 1101>>>

6. Anolis cristatellus.
T. Anolis pulchellus.
8. Anolis stratulus.
9. Anolis velifer (Vieques). 10. Spheriodactylus macrolepis (Vieques). Ll. Eimys concinna.
As the record of the North American Ainys concinna® is based upon two young specimens received from Mr. Riise, who had only a ‘‘ wellfounded idea” that they came from Porto Rico, it may be excluded from the list which thus contains only ten species.
Not long after the publication of Reinhardt and Luetken’s list, specimens collected by Mr. George Latimer in Porto Rico were received by the Smithsonian Institution, and reported on by Professor Cope in his Sixth Contribution to the Herpetology of Tropical America.’ The number of species sent by Mr. Latimer was nine, as follows:
1. Peltaphryne lemur. 2. Cystignathus albilabris vay. 3. Hemidactylus mabura, 4. Mabuya fulgida. 5. Diploglossus degener. 6. Anolis weli fer. Typhlops sp. 8. Chilabothrus inornatus. 9 Alsophis sancticrucis.
At least five of chese species are additional to Reinhardt and Luetken’s list—namely, the first five—thus bringing the total number of species definitely known from Porto Rico and Vieques in 1868 up to fifteen.
The next addition is in 1871, when Sphargis coriacea was added by Dr. Bello y Espinosa.“ He also mentioned the occurrence of the TTylodes, though without identifying it. With this addition the number of species became sixteen.
A decided step forward in our knowledge of the herpetology of Porto Rico was taken when Prof. W. Peters, in 1876,¢ published his paper upon the collections made by the German vice-consul in Mayaguez, Mr. L. Krug, and the well-known zoologist of Habana, Dr. J. Gundlach, who visited the island in 1873 and again in 1875-76.° The collections, which are deposited in the Berlin Museum, embraced nineteen species of reptiles and batrachians, of which six were additions
«One of the specimens in question seems to be now in the Hofmuseum at Vienna, and is there determined as the Mexican Pseudemys ornata cataspila.

to the fauna, two being described as new species. The additions, in Professor Peters’s nomenclature, are as follows:
1. Anolis quadlachi.
2. Anolis kruqi.
3. Ameiva ples.
4. Amphishena ceed.
5. Dromicus PUTULFTOns.
6. Hylodes martinicensis.
Total number of species known in 1876 consequently was twenty-two.
The substance of Dr. Peters’s paper was republished in [8st by Dr. Gundlach in the Anales de la Sociedad Espanola de Historia Natural in Madrid, translated into Spanish, with the addition of two species, namely, the marine turtles Chelonia viridis and Caretta fimbricata, thus bringing the number of species up to twenty-four.
Dr. Agostin Stahl, the venerable patriot and naturalist of Bayamon, Porto Rico, in 1882 published a Fauna de Puerto-Rico, intended mainly as a catalogue of his large collections, but with brief indications of the characters of some of the species. In his list of the reptiles he omits two species, namely, Jlabuya sloani and Lemidaetylus mabouia, though the latter is indicated without name, but a marine turtle is added, namely Chelona caretta, thus increasing the number of species known to twenty-five.
In 1896 Dr. Boulanger, the celebrated herpetologist and icthyologist of the British Museum, reported upon a small collection of reptiles from Mona Island deposited in the museum at Magdeburg, Germany, by Mr. H. Boettcher. It contained but three species, but the ljvecva turned out to be an undescribed species which Dr. Boulanger named A, alboquttata, raising the number of species to twenty-six.
The twenty-seventh species also comes from Mona Island, being a boid snake, picrates monensis, described in 1898 from four specimens in the museum at Hamburg,Germany, by Dr. Zenneck. These specimens were collected on Mona Island during 1891 and 1894 by Mr. Ch. Bock, who, at that time, sent the Hamburg museum a large number of specimens of other species from this interesting little island. These were reported upon by Mr. Meerwarth in 1901, who thus was able to add three species, two of which he described as new forms, namely //ylodes monens/s and Sphorodactylus macrolepis monens?s, the third being J/etopoceros cornutus, making a total of thirty species for Porto Rico and dependent islands.
This ends the published records of the batrachians and reptiles in Porto Rico.”
The present work increases the number of species to thirty-nine, being an addition of nine species. The number of species described as new
“It should be added, however, that in the various important contributions to the West Indian herpetology published by Prof. 8S. Garman there are frequent references to Porto Rican specimens, but as none of the species so mentioned by him have been additional to the fauna they have not been noticed in the present connection,

is nine, but two of the species here named for the first time have been known as Porto Rican under different names. The new species named in this paper are as follows:

<<<Page: 1104>>>

In analyzing the composition of the Porto Rican herpetological fauna we find that out of a total of thirty-five species (excluding the marine turtles) no less than twenty-one are peculiar, of which fifteen are peculiar to Porto Rico proper and six to Mona.
On the other hand Porto Rico has only 2 species in common with the Caribbean Islands, the same 2 species also ranging over,the other larger Antilles. Two more species Porto Rico proper shares with the latter. The rest of the species occur in the Virgin Islands. Porto Rico thus forms with the latter a group characterized by an extraordinarily great proportion of peculiar species.
But while the fauna of Porto Rico, both in itself and in combination with the Virgin Islands, shows a high amount of specialization demonstrating a considerable degree of isolation in time, it must not be imagined that the separation is very deep seated. On the contrary, the affinities with the other Antilles, especially the larger ones to the west, are very close and can readily be traced.
Betore doing so we must first dispose of those species which, as shown in the table of distribution of the Porto Rican species, have been found outside of the Antillean islands.
The first of these is the blind snake, Zyphlops lumbricalis, of which specimens are said to have come from British Guiana. The range of this species embraces almost all the Antilles, and its presence in northeastern South America presents nothing unusual except, perhaps, the circumstance that it has been able to retain its specific integrity over an area so disconnected. But examples of this kind are not rare. The species is further on referred to the category of forms showing South American affinities.
The next species is /Zemidactylus mabouia. This is one of the most widely distributed geckos and seems to possess an extraordinary sapacity for being carried about in cargoes and establishing itself permanently in places where so introduced. It is most likely that this dispersal is effected through the eggs, which are fastened to the objects shipped, rather than by transport of the adult animals themselves. It is now found in South Africa, Madagascar, various parts of South America, Mexico, and several of the West Indian islands. Its introduction into Porto Rico is probably of very recent date, which accounts for its comparative rarity.
The status of the frog, Leptodactylus albilabris, is quite different from ‘that of the other species of the fauna. In the Antilles it is restricted to the Virgin Islands, St. Croix, Vieques, and Porto Rico. There is apparently no indigenous species of the genus in the Caribbean chain, the other two which occur in various islands being evi-

<<<Page: 1105>>>

dently introduced by man and belonging to widely different South American species. No Leptodactylus or related form is found in Haiti, Cuba, or Jamaica. But the most curious feature is that a frog which neither Dr. Boulanger nor I can distinguish from ZL. albzlabris, is a native of southern Mexico, State of Vera Cruz, and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.“ I know of absolutely no parallel to this extraordinary range, which is inexplicable on ordinary distributional grounds, for certainly it would transgress the boundaries of the probable to suppose either that this species had once covered the whole country between Tehuantepec and the Virgin Islands and become extinct in the intermediate territory, or that there had at any time been a direct connection between the localities mentioned to the exclusion of the large Antilles. Nor can it for a moment be supposed that the species exists in the latter without having attracted attention. No doubt there are many species yet to be discovered in these islands, but Z. albilabris is not likely to be one of them, for it is one of the commonest, most obtrusive, and most easily caught batrachians wherever it occurs. In suggesting accidental introduction by man I am fully aware that this explanation does not at first appear plausible, as there does not seem to be or to have been any direct route of communication between southern Mexico or Yucatan and Porto Rico or the Virgin Islands, but I offer it as the only possibility I can think of. The wrecking of a vessel with a cargo of logwood or mahogany a hundred years or more ago might account for this remarkable distribution.
Leaving, then, out of consideration the two species whose introduction we ascribe to man, //emidactylus mabouia and Leptodactylus albilabris, the herpetological fauna of Porto Rico falls into two groups, namely, the species which have in all probability originally extended their range from northeastern South America and those whose ancestors came from the west, primarily from the present mainland of Central America, and secondarily from the other Great Antilles.
Comparatively few, probably not more than five of the genere inhabiting Porto Rico, point toward South America.
Ameiva is probably of southern origin. The West Indian members of this genus form several minor but fairly well circumscribed groups, indicating that they originated from a secondary evolutional center located in the archipelago. Nevertheless, on the whole they appear to be more closely allied to the types characteristic of northeastern South America than to the Central American forms, those found in Cuba and Jamaica being most divergent, perhaps, from those of the mainland opposite.
The Amphisbeenians, judging from the present distribution of the genus, probably also entered from the south, and the blind snakes
c=) (Typhlops) almost certainly did so.
“ Also possibly Yucatan. Ives, Proc. Phila. Acad., 1891, p. 461.

<<<Page: 1106>>>

The snakes of the genus A/sophis, though forming an almost exciusively Antillean group, nevertheless betray South American relationship, and those of the genus Le/madophis in a still higher degree.
The great majority of the Porto Rican species, however, are of decidedly western affinities. Thus the Bufo, the various species of Eleutherodactylus, the Mabuya, the Celestus, the two boas and the fresh-water turtle are obviously related to species in the Great Antilles to the west of Porto Rico. The Anoles and the Spherodactylus are also allied more intimately to western species. Asa matter of fact the most characteristic species of Anol/s, for instance, A. CUIEL 1, A. cristatellus, and the little group represented by A. pulehellus, are utterly foreign to the Caribbean islands, and it is quite apparent that the Anoles have developed in a secondary evolutional center located somewhere in what is now known as the Greater Antilles.
Compared with the other Greater Antilles the herpetology of Porto Rico is negatively defined by the absence of a great many characteristic forms. This poverty is easily understood, however, when we reflect that Porto Rico is located at the extreme eastern and northern point of the two series of islands, the Greater and the Lesser Antilles, and that at the maximum distance from both the Central American and South American mainland Porto Rico has obtained its fauna by immigration from both directions, and being at the farthest end has received the fewest number of colonists.
The herpetological fauna as here understood, for obvious reasons, embraces only the main island and those of the adjacent islands with which it passed into American possession by the treaty of Paris.
As has been demonstrated, Porto Rico shows great affinity herpetologically to the Virgin Islands, and the two islands belonging to the former, but situated intermediate, Culebra and Vieques, are also intermediate in their fauna to a certain extent. The coronelline snakes, however, and one of the tree-toads occurring in Vieques or Culebra or both are identical with those of the Virgin Islands, differing decidedly from the corresponding species inhabiting Porto Rico proper. This is the more interesting as we know of only one species which occurs both in Porto Rico and Vieques or Culebra and does not also inhabit one or more of the Virgin Islands, viz, Spherodactylus grandisquamis.
The little island of Mona, on the other hand, is situated between Porto Rico and Haiti. Thus far not less than nine species are known to occur there, namely:
1. Meutherodactylus monensis. . Spherodactylus monensis. Mabuya sloanii. Ameiva alboguttata. Anolis monensis. . Cyclura cornuta
oR ge be

<<<Page: 1107>>>

7. TLyphlops tumbricalis. 8. Epicrates monensis. 9. Alsophis portoricensis.
These also show a mixture of types. A/sophis portoricensis 1s typical Porto Rican; Spherodactylus monensis, Ameiva alboguttata, and Anolis monensis, although described as separate forms, are very closeiy allied to Porto Rican species; Mabuya sloanii occurs both in Porto Rico and Haiti; Lleutherodactylus monensis and Epicrates monensis are most nearly related to Haitian species, while Cyclura cornuta is typically Haitian, the genus even being unknown in Porto Rico; Zyphlops lumbrical’s is of wide distribution, as shown above. The herpetological fauna of Mona is consequently exactly intermediate between Porto Rico and Haiti, as is its geographical position.
The herpetological relations of Porto Rico to the Virgin Islands immediately to the east is very close, as might be expected, located, as they are, within sight of each other and on the same bank limited by the 100-fathom line. St. Croix, which is separated by a deep channel from the others, is also more distantly related, possessing, as it does, several species not found in the Virgin Islands proper, much less in Porto Rico, namely, 7Thecadactylus rapicauda (possibly accidentally introduced), Anol/s acutus, Ameiva polops, and Alsophis sancti-crucis.
If we compare the fauna of Porto Rico with that of St. Thomas and St. John more in detail, we will find that the chief difference lies in the absence in the latter of a great number of species occurring in the former, as will be seen from the following:
List of Porto Rican species (@) not found in St. Thomas or St. John.
1. Bufo lemur. 10. Anolis krugi.
2. Eleutherodactylus auriculatus. 11. Anolis poncensis.
3. Eleutherodactylus richmondi. 12. Amphisbena ceca.
4. Eleutherodactylus unicolor. | 13. Amphisbena bakeri. 5. Spherodactylus grandisquamis. 14. Typhlops rostellatus. 6. Celestus pleii. 15. Epicrates inornatus. 7. Anolis cuvieri. 16. Leimadophis stahli. 8. Anolis gundlachi. 17. Alsophis portoricensis. 9. Anolis evermanni.
It will be seen that the existence of many of these species in Porto Rico is not due solely to the fact that it is much the larger island, but also to its more western location and more intimate relation to the other large Antilles. On the other hand, some of the species in this list are represented in the Virgin Islands by very closely related forms.
«Excluding those found in Mona Island.

<<<Page: 1108>>>

The number of species occurring in St. Thomas and St. John but not in Porto Rico proper are very few, as shown in the following:
List of species occurring in St. Thomas (¢) and St. John but not in Porto Rico proper.
1. Eleutherodactylus lentus. 5. Amphishbena fenestrata. 2. Eleutherodactylus antillensis. 6. Leimadophis exiqguus. 3. Spherodactylus macrolepis. 7. Alsophis antillensis.
4. Iguana iguana.
It will be seen in every case but one that these represent species living in Porto Rico, and, moreover, that three of them extend so far west as to include Vieques and Culebra, namely, /Veutherodactylus antilensis, Leimadophis exigquus, and Alsophis antillensis. The only species which is not represented at all in Porto Rico is /guana iguana, and it is altogether probable that this species has been introduced originally by man.
As an offset to the three peculiar Virgin Island species mentioned above. which extend as far west as Vieques, we may mention for the sake of completeness a Porto Rican species which reaches Tortola, but which has not been recorded from St. Thomas or St. John, namely, Anolis cuvieri.
It is then plain that the sixteen species of reptiles and batrachians found in St. Thomas and St. John? form only a herpetological appendix to Porto Rico.
With regard to the vertical distribution of the batrachians and reptiles in Porto Rico it must be borne in mind that the island, although very mountainous, does not rise to such great altitudes as the other Greater Antilles. The El Yunque Mountain, which has been considered the highest point in Porto Rico, has lately been determined to be
a@Only such species are included the occurrence of which is corroborated by repeated finds, and consequently undoubted. ) | )
o1. Leptodactylus albilabris. 9. Anolis cristatellus.
2. Hleutherodactylus antillensis. 10. Anolis stratulus.
3. Eleutherodactylus lentus. 11. Anolis pulchellus.
4. Thecadactylus rapicauda. 12. Iguana iguana.
5. Hemidactylus mabouia. 13. Amphishena fenestrata, 6. Sphexrodactylus macrolepis. 14. Typhlops lumbricalis. 7. Mabuya sloanii. 15. Leimadophis eaiguus. 8. Ameiva evul. 16. Alsophis antillensis.
A number of species credited to St. Thomas on the strength of uncorroborated museum labels is here left out. It is not unusual that museum specimens are credited to the place from which they were shipped, which may have been another than the one in which they were collected. On the other hand, single specimens accidentally introduced from near-by islands may well be expected in a place like St. Thomas.

only 3,485 feet. Nevertheless, there are several species which are contined either to the lowlands or to the mountains respectively, while others range over the whole territory, from sea level to the highest peaks. The elevations reached by the batrachians and reptiles vary toa great extent locally, depending, as they do, on the climatic conditions. Consequently, the species inhabiting the higher altitudes descend lower on the northern slope of the great mountain chains which traverse the island from east to west, and the lowland species ascend higher on the southern slope.
Only a single species ranges all the way from sea level to the highest mountain tops, namely, the tree toad, or coqui (leutherodactylus auriculatus).
On the other hand, about ten species are confined to the lowlands, some never reaching, others very seldom ascending, beyond 500 feet. In this category fall the following species:
Bufo lemur.
Lemidactylus mabouia. Spherodactylus grandisquamis. Mabuya sloanic.
Ameiva exul.
Anolis pulchellus.
Anolis poncensis.
Typhlops lumbricalis.
Alsophis portoricensis. Pseudemys palustris.
A few species reach well into the coffee belt, though it is doubtful
whether they go much beyond 1,000 feet altitude, namely: Anolis cuviert. Amphishena ceca. Epicrates ¢nornatus. Leimadophis stahli.
Others, again, we know to range from sea level to about 1,500 feet, such as—
Leptodactylus albilabris. Anolis cristatellus. Anolis stratulus.
Among the species which do not descend to sea level there are a few confined to intermediate altitudes. These range between about 500 and 1,500 feet, though the blind snake and the blind lizard probably do not reach much higher than 1,000 feet. They are:
Celestus plevi. Anolis krug?. Amphishena bakeri.
Typhlops rostellatus.

<<<Page: 1110>>>

Two species we have found occupying all the zones from an average altitude of, say, 500 feet to the highest mountain tops, namely: Anolis qurdlachi. Anolis evermannt. One batrachian which also reaches the highest elevations but which scarcely descends below 800 feet is “/eutherodactylus richmond. Finally a single species, thus far only known from one specimen, appears to be contined to the tops of the mountains, about 3,000 feet altitude, viz: Hleutherodactylus unicolor.

Custom and practical considerations account for the batrachians and reptiles still being treated of together, though it has been demonstrated long ago and now universally admitted by naturalists that they constitute separate classes, more nearly related perhaps to the birds on the one hand and to the fishes on the other than among themselves. The nonscientific public, however, can not be blamed for confounding the two classes, especially since the distinguishing characters are chiefly anatomical, and it is consequently the more necessary that their distinctness be insisted on and emphasized whenever the herpetologist, whose studies embrace both, addresses himself to this public. As it is among the objects of the present work to afford those who have not given special attention to this study a ready means of identifying the **creeping” animals of Porto Rico, it may not be out of place here to mention that the members of the two classes occurring there can be distinguished by external characters as follows:
1. Batrachia.—Body covered with a soft skin and not ineased ina bony shell.
Il. Reptilia. — Body covered with horny scales and plates, or incased in a bony shell, with a horny or leathery covering.
Class BATRACHIA.
Of the three orders composing the living batrachians only one, namely, the Sa/ventia, or tailless batrachians, is represented in Porto Rico. This order, usually known as frogs and toads, again falls into three suborders, of which Porto Rico also has representatives in only one, namely, the ZLenaguata, that is, those with tongue but no ribs. Two families with three genera comprise the Porto Rican fauna and may be distinguished as follows:
a’ No teeth; a large gland (parotoid) on each side of neck; skin very rough, warty | (RISTO TUL CLE) ) mrp ene eee ae See ence. See oI, Lone en A = Bufo, p. 569.

The above synomymy only embraces such names as are additional to previously published lists or directly referable to the group to which the Porto Rican species belongs.
The toads (Spanish Sapo) with their warty skin are so well known that a generic description seems superfluous in this connection,
Only one species of this numerous and almost cosmopolitan genus is found within our territory, though a second one has been reported upon insufficient or erroneous evidence.

This species has been united by Peters with a related one from Santo Domingo, a conclusion since adopted by Boulenger and Garman. Though having no specimens from Santo Domingo for direct comparison, I venture to disagree with them, as Boulenger’s own description? and Giinther’s figure © of Santo Domingan specimens show characters suflicient to separate the two species, as, for
Fig. 1. instance, the vastly greater development of
gore joe aeeret the cephalic crests, the horizontal expansion
a of the upper jaw into a labial crest, the pres-
ence of a parietal crest, and of a prominent subnasal ridge. The
Porto Rican specimens also have single conical tubercles under the
digital articulations, while the Santo Domingan ones are said by Boulenger to have toes ‘* with double subarticular tubercles.”

Description of adult.—U.S.N.M. No. 27148; Arecibo, Porto Rico; April 4, 1900; L. Stejneger, collector. Top of head bony, with enormous crests inclosing a deep hollow between the orbits, the height of the supraorbital crest being about 7 mm. above the interorbital space and 3 mm. above the eyelid; the orbital crest originates on the canthus rostralis extending backward ina great arch to behind the eye, from which point a similarly high supratympanic crest projects backward, ending in a rounded knob; from the supraocular crest a lower anteorbital ridge and a higher postorbital crest descend toward the edge of the upper jaw, joining there the high supralabial crest, which

extends from below the nostril to the juncture with the postorbital crest; from the inner side of the supraorbital crests a low parietal spur proceeds obliquely toward the occiput, not as a continuous crest, but broken up into several ridges and knobs; snout prominent; lores Ceep; eyes sunk deep in a large squarish socket; upper lip expanded horizontally as a bony crest several millimeters wide; tympanum elliptically erect, its horizontal diameter scarcely one-half the width of the eye; parotoid gland large, descending behind the ear, but not of very distinct outline, as it is densely covered with large conical warts, each

Coloration of living specimens. —U.S.N.M. No. 27148 (L. 8S. No. 9058). Tris pale brassy, sprinkled with black. General color above dull claycolored with a strong olive wash; blackish brown markings and an illdefined hourglass-shaped mark between shoulders; alsoa larger blackish spot on each side of the coccyx, which is marked by a pale streak; indications of blackish cross bands on legs; underside dirty white, becoming flesh-colored behind and strongly reddish flesh color on underside of femur and nearest portion of belly; tips of toes dark brown; tips of warts on back black, those between shoulders particularly large.
Another specimen (No. 27149) was colored as follows: Upper side olive, strongly suffused with ‘* gallstone yellow,” which is particularly noticeable over the insertion of the fore limbs; very few traces of dusky markings, but the pustules are black, especially anteriorly; an intensely ochraceous-rufous spot on the middle of the back; on the underside the yellow suffusion invades the white ground-color on the portion nearest to the flanks.
The third large specimen (No. 27150) was quite similar to the last, though without any rufous spot on the back, which seems to be an anomaly. Whole upper surface darker olive, and flanks, including space at base of fore limb and below the ear, more intensely and more well-defined yellow; underside dirty yellowish white.
A young specimen (No. 27151) was colored as follows: General color above drab, more isabella-colored on head; dark markings blackish, those on shoulders pale-edged externally; flanks with a purplish suffusion and indications of a broad longitudinal band, well-defined and pale-edged above, but gradually fading below into the pale isabella color of the belly; underside with a network of coarse dark-gray mottlings and marblings.
Habitat.—The toad seems to be somewhat rare in Porto Rico, possibly because of lack of suitable localities. Dr. Stahl informed me.

that during all his forty years of collecting in the island he had never come across it himself, and the six specimens which in that time he had obtained were brought to him by the peasants as curiosities. Neither Mr. Baker nor any of the Fish Commission parties saw it, and for a long while all the inquiries of Dr. Richmond and myself were unavailing. The natives knew the name ‘*Sapo concho,” but when told to bring specimens they invariably handed in some Lleutherodactylus ov Leptodactylus. A rumor had it that a certain druggist in Arecibo many years ago had had a specimen on exhibition in his store, and consequently we at last repaired to that city as a last resort. The druggist was found and corroborated the rumor, but the specimen had long since disappeared. We made diligent inquiries in the neighborhood through our young friend Mr. Enrique L. Brascoechea, and finally, as we had almost given up hope, he found an old beggar who remembered a place where as a boy he had seen the sapos. He was promised a substantial reward, and on the last evening of our stay in Arecibo brought in five fine specimens captured about 3 miles south of the town. He said he had found them in holes under the roots of palm trees at the border of a fresh-water pond, where they keep in hiding during the day.
Bufo lemur is the only toad found in Porto Rico, and is not known from any other island. In Vieques we were informed that the ** Sapo concho” occurs, but we failed to obtain specimens, although we made special efforts and offered a high reward for specimens.“

«Bufo marinus (Linneeus), which occurs in many West Indian islands, probably introduced, is only mentioned here, because Reinhardt and Luetken write (Vid. Meddel. Naturhist. Foren., 1862, p. 202; author’s reprint, p. 50, footnote) that it is occasionally brought to St. Thomas with lumber from ‘‘ Vieques and Hayti.’’? There is no reason to believe, however, that the reported origin of these imported toads is correctly given by their informant in so far as Vieques is concerned. Bufo marinus isa very large species with enormous triangular parotoid glands, which are nearly smooth.

Review, 1865 (p. 112) (type Rana labyrinthica). Although not a frog in a strictly scientific sense, the Leptodactylus counterfeits the external appearance of the true frogs to perfection, and the one living in Porto Rico will probably always be known to the English-speaking people there as the frog, as it has always been known to the Spanish population by the name of ** Rana.” : Only one species occurs in Porto Rico and dependent islands, possibly originally introduced through the agency of man, as elsewhere suggested in this work (p. 562). The genus is tropical American.

Whether Brocchi’s Leptodactylus caliginosus” really belongs here is somewhat more doubtful. The figure does not much resemble this species, nor does the description mention the conspicuous white labial stripe. Bocourt’s observation that the voice of the species collected by him at Isabal and at Pansos resembles the baying of «a dog and may be rendered by the syllable rhowap! rhouap/ is also at variance with my own experience with L. a/bzlabris in Porto Rico.

Coloration of living specimens.—Adult; U.S.N.M. No. 26820; L. S. No. 9043; Mameyes, Porto Rico, March 3, 1900. General color above olive, the dusky markings dark grayish brown, nearly blackish brown below the dorso-lateral fold and on femur; the dorso-lateral fold and narrow edges around the dark markings pale olive gray; the transocular band and cutting edge of lip dark grayish brown; the supralabial light band pale straw yellow; underside whitish; throat finely sprinkled with dark chocolate brown; iris olive silvery, overlaid with blackish.
Another adult specimen, same locality and time (U.S.N.M. No. 26821, L. S. No. 9044), had the general color a little more clayey and the dark markings darker and arranged longitudinally. (In alcohol the middle line of the back becomes quite light, forming a pale median band from between eyes to vent, bordered on both sides by a blackish line. )
Young.—U.S.N.M. 26894; L. S. No. 9040; Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude; March 1,1900. Above clay-colored, becoming darker posteriorly and on sides below the dorso-lateral fold which, like the
varts on the sides and a few on the back, is copper colored, the fold being edged with dusky below; a broad cream-colored band from tip of snout under eye and tympanum to arm, bordered above and below by very distinct black lines, the upper one through nostril, eye, and tympanum, the lower margining the upper lip; the light labial band is continued as upper side of the arm, which is slightly more brownish, and the black band below also continues halfway down to the elbow; a black mark in the groin; hind limbs pale olive, barred with black; posterior surface of femur with a conspicuous longitudinal streak of silvery white, margined with black; iris golden, overlaid with black.
In a large lot (56) of specimens from Vieques (U.S.N.M. Nos. 27084 to 27139; L. S. No. 9052; March 24, 1900), of all sizes, there is a great amount of individual variation in color. The ground color of the back varies between reddish brown through various shades of brown and olive to olive green and even olive yellow, mostly with dusky markings and mottlings between the dorso-lateral folds, though often quite uniform, especially when the ground color is more or less olive. The light labial line is variously developed, but nearly always plainly indicated. The dusky markings on the back show no tendency to

Description of tadpole.—U.S.N.M. No. 26895; Catalina plantation, Porto Rico, about 900 feet altitude; March 1, 1900, L. Stejneger, collector. Length of body about once and one-third its width and slightly less than one-half the length of the tail; nostrils nearer the eyes than the end of the snout; distance between eyes one-fifth more than distance between the nostrils, and considerably less than width of mouth; distance between nostrils equals their distance from eyes, as well as the diameter of the eyes; spiraculum on left side, directed backward and upward, situated above a line drawn between the base

of the muscular part of the tail and the mouth, and nearer to the posterior extremity of the body, being about halfway between anterior border of eye and insertion of hind legs; anus a long tube, median and larger than the spiraculum; tail about four times as long as deep, ending in an obtuse point; both upper and lower crests confined to the tail and nearly equal in depth, their edges being nearly parallel until the terminal third; the depth of the muscular part of the tail at its base about two-thirds the greatest total depth.

Beak white with black edges, the cutting edges plainly denticulated | like the dental rows; lips with a double row of papille except on the median half of the upper lip, the sides forming an inward fold; the series of labial teeth 3, all equally long and occupying the whole width of the lips; the first upper series narrowly interrupted in the middle, the others uninterrupted.
Lines of muciferous ducts rather indistinct in this specimen. They are better developed in the specimens of No. 27284, taken by me at Utuado on April 9, 1900, especially in 27234d7, which shows also the lateral lines. Two lines start on the head; one between the nostrils, the other near the corner of the mouth, converging backward above and below the eye and meeting a short distance behind the latter; from this point they diverge again toward the tail; from the eye ¢ short line of crypts descends a short distance in a vertical direction; a lateral line begins above the anterior end of the spiraculum and curving above the latter is lost above the insertion of the hind limbs.
Color (in alcohol) dusky olive gray on back, underside and tail whitish, the latter more or less irregularly marbled and mottled with dusky.

The total length of the largest adult animal being 144 mm., it is consequently a little more than three times as large as the largest tadpole.
Habitat.—The frog—as we may well call the Leptodactylus albilabris on account of its exceedingly frog-like aspect—is found all over Porto Rico and Vieques near streams and in marshy places, except in the highest altitudes. It has been found as high up as Adjuntas (about 1,400 feet altitude) by Mr. Baker, but it is doubtful whether it ascends above the coffee belt. On the nerthern and eastern side of El Yunque Mountain Dr. Richmond and I did not see it much above the Catalina plantation, or about 900 feet altitude.
Habits.—The breeding season of this frog seems to be early in the vear, as we found a young one with the tail still unabsorbed on February 20. Full-grown tadpoles were also observed at the Catalina plantation on March 1. Ina little stream behind the town of Utuado, on April 7, I not only obtained tadpoles in all stages, but also observed

the remarkable foamy ‘‘nest” of this species, with numerous small black
larvee just hatched.
In raising a large flat stone in the shallow stream
I found a compact ball of snowy foam of a somewhat gelatinous consistency. The ball was about 70 mm. in diameter, and through the
center there extended a canal
hollow the blackish larvae were located. The voice of this species is fairly loud for its size, and can be expressed by the word ‘* pink” in frequent succession,
about the width of a finger.

Genus ELEUTHERODACTYLUS4 Dumeril_and Bibron:
1841. Hleutherodactylus DumErRit and Brsron, Erpét. Gén., VIII, p. 620 (type EH. martinicensis) .
1843. Hylodes Frrzrncer, Syst. Rept., p. 31 (type H. martinicensis) (not of 1826).
1843. Euhyas Frrzincer, Syst. Rept., p. 31 (type H. ricordiz).
1843. Lithodytes Frrzincrr, Syst. Rept., p. 31 (type H. lineatus).
This genus is usually, but wrongly, known as //y/odes. A genus of this name was instituted by Fitzinger in 1826,’ based upon two species only, one of which must be the type. They were //yla gravenhorstii Fitzinger and //y/a ranoides Spix. The former is a nomen nudum and was never described, the generic term //ylodes being thus restricted to //. ranoides. Regarding the word //ylodes as improperly formed, Wagler, in 1830, substituted * Anydrobius, which consequently is a synonym pure and simple. Tschudi, in 1838,” expressly recognizes /7. ranoides as the type of /Zylodes,’ but at the same time he erected LVoszva for Lichtenstein’s //yla nasus (or nasulus, as Tschudi writes), not knowing that this species was identical with //. ranoides, the type of Flylodes. This error has been perpetuated by later writers, chiefly led by Duméril and Bibron, and also possibly influenced by the fact that Fitzinger himself, in 1843, followed the example of these authors and substituted //. martinicensis, which was not described until 1838, as type for the genus established by himself in £826.
As to the proper name for the genus the choice lies between the one

which Duméril and Bibron published in 1841 as having been given previously by them to //. martinicensis in manuscript, and the two
ames given by Fitzinger in 1848 to //. ricordii and T/T. lineatus. The proper interpretation seems to be to regard /Vleutherodactylus as a substitute name, especially when compat ed with Duméril and Bibron’s note concerning Lepthyla on a previous page,” and it is here adopted according ly.
Eleutherodactylus isa genus characteristic of tropical America, and comprises a large number of species often difficult to distinguish. In many respects they resemble the true tree toads, though structurally they are nearer the frog-like Leptodactylus.
Numerous species oécur in the Antillean islands, five being found in Porto Rico and dependent islands.

The identity of the tree toad of Porto Rico has been a matter of great uncertainty. Peters, who compared Porto Rican specimens with the type of //ylodes martinicensis from Martinique, declares them to be identical; and Garman, who also had before him specimens from both localities, came to the same result.

I have no specimens from Martinique itself, but with a large series from Guadeloupe (whence it is said the species was introduced to Martinique), which, therefore, I take to represent /. martinicensis fairly well, and another large series from St. Kitts agreeing with the Guadeloupe series, | must dissent from the above conclusion. The Porto Rican specimens are certainly very close to the latter species, and the proportions of the hind legs to the length of the head and body are nearly the same; nevertheless, the Porto Rican specimens have constantly a shorter second toe and the exposed tympanum averages larger. In the Porto Rican specimens the end of the first toe when pressed alongside the second nearly reaches the disk of the

latter, while in the Guadeloupe, St. Kitts, and Tobago specimens the interval between the two disks is considerably larger than the diameter of the disks.
In both respects the Porto Rican specimens agree well with typical Cuban specimens of 7. auriculatus (Cope), from which I can not sepa‘ate them. Boulenger refers three Santo Domingo specimens in the British Museum to the same species, and describes them as having the first toe ‘tas long as second,” a character he also uses in the ‘* key” as the distinction of /Z. auriculatus, and I take it that by this phrase he intends to express the same relation between the toes as I have described above. A poorly preserved specimen in the U. 5. National Museum (No. 9858) from Santo Domingo I am also unable to separate from /. auriculatus.
I can not agree with Boulenger, however, in placing Reinhardt and

Luetken’s //. antéllensis from St. Thomas as a synonym of /. auriculatus. The former has entirely different proportions, the legs and feet being much shorter.
Description of adult. —U.S.N.M. No. 26912, Camp El Yunque, Porto Rico, 2,978 feet altitude; February 24, 1900; L. Stejneger, collector. Tongue narrow, oval, nicked behind; vomerine teeth in two short oblique series some distance behind the choanw, not extending laterally beyond the latter and strongly converging backward, the interval between them about equaling their distance from the choanze; nostrils much nearer the tip of the snout than the eyes, their distance from the eye nearly equalling the diameter of the latter; upper eyelids nearly as wide as interorbital space; tympanum small, about one-third the diameter of the eye, its distance from the eye equaling the diameter; fingers with well-developed disks, first equaling second; disks of toes smaller than those of the fingers; tip of first toe reaching the base of the disk of the second; two moderate metatarsal tubercles; soles smooth except for one or two obscure tubercles; no tarsal fold; the bent limbs being pressed along the side, knee and elbow overlap; hind limb being extended along the side, heel reaches eye; hind limbs being placed vertically to the axis of the body, the heels overlap considerably; skin above with scattered granules on back and_ sides, the eyelids more densely granulated; a very fine, scarcely perceptible, glandular ridge down the middle of the upper surface from tip of snout to vent; belly and posterior half of thighs strongly granular; throat and anterior half of thighs smooth; the belly has no specially differentiated adhesive area or disk.

The largest specimens out of 115 collected in Porto Rico (Nos. 26908-10) measure 43 mm. from tip of snout to vent.
Coloration of living specimens.—The variation of color presented by this species is simply endless, there being scarcely ever two spectmens alike, and a detailed description of individuals is therefore useless. The description of the first adult specimen collected may serve as an example, however, to which I may then append the notes written down with large series of living specimens before me.

line and a broad lateral line in continuation of the latter, pale buffy pink, all the light lines and bands more or less edged with dusky; triangle on top of head forward of a line through the center of the eyes distinctly paler, a dusky cross-line at middle of eyes defining the triangular space behind; below pale, greenish on belly; underside of femur dull ferruginous; iris golden, shaded with reddish and brownish and reticulated with blackisb.
At our camp about 500 feet below the top of El Yunque Mountain (3,485 feet) I gathered, between February 24 and February 27, over 50 specimens, adult and young, upon which I based my observations on the truly extraordinary variability of this species, both as to ground color and pattern.
While the adult specimens seem to show a more uniform pattern with certain nearly constant features, namely, a pale triangular snout to the middle of the upper eyelids, followed by a dusky cross-band and a blackish narrow streak along the canthus rostralis through the eye (the horizontal pupil forming part of this line) over the ear to the shoulder, the individual range in their ground color is very great, from pale olive gray through clay color and pale cinnamon rufous to dark sepia. Their power of changing their general color is also great, for one which when caught on the ground under an old palm leaf was nearly blackish brown, changed within a quarter of an hour to pale clay color. The most abnormal among the large specimens is rather dark grayish brown (slightly paler after being caught) and covered with numerous cream-colored irregular blotches, which on the legs assume the character of more or less regular cross-bands. But the young specimens show a much wider and more perplexing range of variation, for while the pattern indicated above for the adults can be traced in perhaps most of these youngsters, in others it is absolutely obliterated. Yet in all this bewildering variability there may be traced several different styles which, however, are connected by all sort of intermediate individuals.
The most striking of these patterns consists in a cinnamon-colored stripe down the middle of the back edged with dusky and widening on the sacrum and toward the head, where it is abruptly cut off by the interorbital dusky cross-band; this triangular expansion thus formed incloses on the occiput a small spot which, like the sides, is bright light yellowish green; the pale triangle on the snout and cross-bands on the hind limbs are similarly colored, but much duller. This style is not rare, though apparently confined to the smallest specimens. I found four essentially alike at the base of the leaves of the same airplant, probably belonging to the same brood.
The most common pattern (found in perhaps 75 per cent of the young specimens) consists in a pair of elongated pale dorsal marks slightly curved, with the convexity toward the median line, as well as

<<<Page: 1130>>>

a similarly colored spot on the occiput and cross-bars on the hind legs, all the pale marks more or less plainly edged with dusky; the ground color varies from dark to light grayish brown overlaid to a varying degree with yellowish or reddish. This style is evidently only a modification of the one described above, the dark ground color having encroached upon the light flanks. Some of these specimens are so dark that the pattern can be made out only with difficulty. One of the large adult specimens shows distinct traces of the dorso-lateral pale semilunar marks.
The next style, represented by a few specimens only, is very different. These are nearly uniform dark brownish gray with a very narrow, sharply defined pale line from tip of snout down the middle of the back to the vent, where it bifurcates and extends along the posterior edge of each femur; another line, less pale, crosses this one on the interorbital space. Several specimens combine the common pattern as described above with this narrow median line.
A single young specimen in the lot is light olive gray with a pale longitudinal band on the middle line from snout to vent so broad as to nearly fill the interorbital space; the post-femoral streak is faintly indi‘ated; the pale lines are indistinctly outlined with dusky and there are similar cross marks visible on the hind legs.
A curious feature is also the variability in the coloration of the iris. In the younger specimens it is brassy, more or less overlaid with dusky. In the adults, however, it is golden with a vertical blackish streak in the middle of the lower half. However, if the sides of the face are much darker than the region above, the iris is also darker in the lower half below the narrow horizontal pupil which, as indicated above, forms the continuation of the canthal black line.
That the coqui or tree toad in other localities assumes a coloration closely agreeing with the surroundings is proven by several specimens collected in the western part of the island. A large adult specimen caught by Dr. Richmond near the summit of the pass between Adjuntas and Ponce, was of a reddish brown ground color, closely resembling the clay upon which it was found (U.S.N.M. No. 27280; L. 8. No. 9067). The four specimens, on the other hand, which we took under stones in the white clay hills east of Ponce on April 16, were nearly uniform pale clay colored, with no markings, not even a trace of a pale dorso-lateral band.
Hlabitat.—The **coqui” is common all over Porto Rico, from se: level to the top of the highest mountains; in fact we found it most abundant in the excessively damp woods near the top of El Yunque. It does not occur on Vieques, nor has it been found on Mona Island, a distribution quite unexpected in view of the fact that the species also occurs in Santo Domingo and eastern Cuba. .
Habits. —Although by no means confined to living on or among the

<<<Page: 1131>>>

trees this species probably deserves the name of tree toad more than any of the other species of the genus inhabiting these islands. A favorite place of concealment during the day we found to be the axils of the leaves of palms and liliaceous plants, but it was also caught under the bark of trees, fallen logs, stones, or in crevices in the rocks, clay banks, or in holes in trees.
They keep usually quiet during the day, but toward dusk they come out from their hiding places and the island then begins to resound with their call notes. These I believe to be different in the adults and the young. The former utter a loud and rather sonorous 6-ki’-ki’-ki’ or simply a persistently repeated 6-ki’, 6-kii . . . The chorus of soft ‘* pit, pit, pit” around our camp in the evening I attributed to the young ones.
Living specimens placed in a glass jar adhere to the sides chiefly by their digital pads or disks. The belly is flattened against the glass, but there is apparently no special adhesive area.
The reproduction of this species is most extraordinary in that the young escape from the egg a full developed frog without undergoing any tadpole stage or metamorphosis. The eggs are usually deposited in the damp axils of an air plant, about 20 to 30 ina lump. The development of the young in the egg is remarkable for the fact that the anterior and posterior limbs appear simultaneously and that there is no trace of gills. In about three weeks the young escape from the egg, the only sign of immaturity being a short rudiment of tail which is absorbed, however, in a few hours. The discovery of this extraordinary batrachian development, which so strongly foreshadows that of the amniote vertebrates, was made by Dr. Bello y Espinosa in 1870 and has been confirmed and elaborated by Gundlach and Peters.

ELEUTHERODACTYLUS ANTILLENSIS “@ (Reinhardt and Luetken. )
1863. Hylodes antillensis ReinHARDT and LurerKen, Vid. Meddel. Naturh. Foren. (Copenhagen ), 1862, p. 209; author’s separate, p. 57 (type locality, St. Thomas; type in Mus. Copenh. ).
This species has been placed as a synonym of £4. auriculatus by Boulenger, but the two are very different indeed. If individuals of the same size are placed side by side the difference in the size of the legs and feet are particularly striking, they being much shorter in FE. antillensis. The fore limbs are especially minute, so much so that the length from axilla to tip of longest finger is about one-half the length from tip of snout to vent, while in 2. wuriculatus the corresponding length of arm and hand greatly exceeds, often by 33 per cent, half the total length of head and body. Asa rule, the heel and elbow of the adpressed limbs barely touch in /. antzllensis, while in #.

No. 27075, U.S.N.M. auriculatus they overlap considerably. In the latter the heels also overlap when the bent hind limbs are placed vertically to the axis of the body—while in this position the heels of Z. anfillensis just meet. Notwithstanding the enormous variation in the coloration of Z. aurdeulatus, there seems to be some difference in the average color of both species. The larger /. antillensis obtained in Vieques are nearly uniformly pale above, and are therefore closely approximated by the pale specimens of 2. auriculatus which we collected in the white limestone hills near Ponce (Nos. 27314-17), but all the young ones were “dull grayish brown with regular dusky longitudinal markings,” thus presenting none of the peculiar patterns so characteristic of the
young £. auriculatus and described above under the latter species. Description.—U.S.N.M. No. 27075, Isabella Segunda, Vieques

Island, Porto Rico; March 24, 1900; L. Stejneger, collector. Tongue rather broad, heart-shaped, slightly nicked behind; vomerine teeth in two club-shaped oblique series, some distance behind but not laterally beyond the choane, converging backward and well separated; nostril much nearer the tip of snout than the eyes, their distance from the eye less than the diameter of the latter; upper eyelids narrower than the interorbital space; tympanum a little less than one-half the diameter of the eye, its distance from the eye less than one-half its diameter; fingers with rather small disks, first equalling second; disks of toes not smaller than those of the fingers; tip of first toe reaching disk of second; two metatarsal tubercles, the outer being rather small and obscure; series of plantar tubercles corresponding to metatarsals; no tarsal fold; the bent limbs being pressed along the side, knee and elbow, fail to meet; hind limb being extended along the side, heel reaches the eye: hind limbs being placed vertically to the axis of the body, the heels barely meet; skin above with scattered granules and a very narrow raised median line from tip of snout to vent; throat and chest smooth, belly and posterior aspect of femur strongly granular; a strong fold across the breast between the axille.

This is the largest of eleven specimens collected by us in Vieques. The largest specimen from St. Thomas described by Reinhardt and Luetken measured 31 mm. in total length. This species seems therefore to be somewhat smaller than /. auriculatus.
Coloration of living specimens.—The larger specimens collected by us in Vieques were pale gray with scarcely any dusky marking except a dark streak from nostrils, through eye, over and behind the tympanum, a few dark mottlings on the posterior concealed part of the thigh, and a dusky longitudinal line on inner side of tibia and tarsus. The smaller specimens were of a uniform dull grayish brown above with regular longitudinal dusky markings.
Tabitat.—This species seems to be confined to Vieques and St. Thomas and is apparently not common. Its occurrence on St. John and St. Croix is somewhat doubtful, according to Reinhardt and Luetken. It was not found by the U. 8. Fish Commission parties in Vieques during their visit in 1899, but a young specimen from this island is in the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.

The only place we found it in Vieques was in the nearly dry bed of a small creek back of the town of Isabella Segunda, where they kept themselves concealed on the damp ground under flat stones.

Several specimens (26958-62) taken at an altitude of about 2,978 feet near the top of El Yunque Mountain, February 24-26, were essentially like the above, to the description of which may be added that the brown color on the back becomes more of an Indian-red on sacrum and femur, fading to a clear rufous flesh-color on the heel. The largest specimen in this lot has the throat strongly suffused with gamboge-yellow.
This species seems to be as remarkable for the stability of its coloration as /. auriculatus is for the reverse.
Remarks.—Vhe present species, which I take great pleasure in dedicating to Dr. Charles W. Richmond in grateful memory of cheerful companionship in the native haunts of this interesting novelty, is apparently nearest related to Hleutherodactylus lentus (Cope), from which it differs in many important points. Thus, the vomerine teeth are placed much farther back from the interior nares, and the second finger is considerably longer than the first instead of equaling it in length; there is no trace of a web between the toes and the outer metatarsal tubercle is much larger. The coloration also is different and remarkably constant.
Habitat.—This new species thus far has only been collected on El Yunque Mountain, from an altitude of about 900 feet to near the top. It was found on damp ground under stones and leaves.

Color of living specimen.—Uniformly dusky chestnut above and below, with scattered, scarcely visible pale dots; a short postocular dusky band descending behind the tympanum.
Habitat.—Only a single specimen was captured. It was caught on the ground at our camp on El Yunque Mountain, about 2,978 feet above the sea.
Remarks.—The present species is so different from the other Z/evtherodactylt in Porto Rico, and in fact from all the species of this multitudinous genus that a special comparison with any of them is quite unnecessary. The declivous snout with the extreme posterior position of the nostrils are quite unique, and I know of no West Indian species which might be regarded as nearly allied. The uniform coloration above and below is also remarkable.

Order SQUAMATA.
This order embraces the lizards and the snakes, which in most cases may be easily told apart by the former possessing legs. A small number of lizards, however, are entirely limbless, externally resembling snakes very closely. The only limbless lizards in Porto Rico are the amphisbeenians, which are readily distinguished from the snakes by having no imbricate scales, the integument being divided by longitudinal and transverse grooves into squarish segments which form recular rings around the body,

The lizards form the most numerous group of the reptiles in Porto Rico, there being no less than nineteen species out of a total of twentyeight land reptiles.

Habitat.—In 1881 Dr. Gundlach wrote that this species had not been observed by him in Porto Rico, but had been sent by Dr. Stahl, who had found it ina house at the capital, San Juan, adding that **it seems to be rare.” Dr. Stahl does not give this species in his Fauna of the following year (1882), but on page 71 he mentions that Don Tomas Blanco, a pharmacist in Porto Rico, had met with ‘another species of the gecko family,” which he himself had observed later on in Aguadilla and other places. It is probably the present species to which he refers. It was not collected by Mr. Baker, nor by any of the Fish Commission naturalists. Dr. Richmond and I were equally unsuccessful. However, the species was reported as having been sent from Porto Rico by Latimer as early as 1868, and Boettger mentions two specimens in the Museum Senckenbergianum donated in 1879 by Mr. Carl Knoblauch; Garman also mentions specimens from Porto Rico in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and, finally, I have recently examined a specimen in the museum in Hamburg collected by Mr. Herman Engel, in San Juan. H. mabouia is a species of extremely wide distribution. Besides having been found in various other West Indian islands, it occurs in many places in South America, South Africa, and Madagascar. It has probably been carried to many distant places in ships, and its occurrence in Porto Rico is undoubtedly due to a similar agency.

Diagnosis.—Dorsal scales very large, as large as those on belly, strongly keeled and imbricate; no granular scales on the vertebral line; scales on breast smooth, a few on fore neck faintly keeled; about 34 scale rows around the middle of the body; 8 dorsals in a head length (snout to ear opening); scales on top of head and temples strongly keeled, imbricate, largest on snout and temples; loreals juxtaposed.
Similar to Spherodactylus macrolepis Gimther, but dorsal scales much larger.
Type.—U.S.N.M. No. 27007; Luquillo, Porto Rico; March 4, 1900; L. Stejneger, collector.
Tlabitat.— Vieques and Porto Rico.
This Spherodactylus, of which we now possess a large series, differs in no other respect from typical S. macrolepis from St. Thomas than in the size of the dorsal scales. J owe the opportunity of a direct comparison with specimens of the latter to the kindness of Prof. S. Garman. ‘The Vieques and Porto Rican specimens agree completely, and their difference from the St. Thomas form is sufficient to warrant their separation by name.
Fias. 46-50.—SPH#RODACTYLUS GRANDISQUAMIS. 46, side of head; 47, top of head; 48, underside of head. 23 x natural size. 49, scales on middle of back; 50, underside of hind foot. 4 * natural size. No. 27007, U.S.N.M.
Description of type specimen.—Adult; U.S.N.M. No. 27007; Luquillo, Porto Rico; March 4, 1900; L. Stejneger, collector. Snout rather pointed and elongate, the distance from the tip to the eye being slightly longer than from the latter to the ear opening, and nearly twice the diameter of the eye; rostral moderate with a long median cleft behind; nostril between rostral, first supralabial, two small postnasals and a large supranasal which is separated from its fellow of the other side by a small median scale, these three bordering the rostral above; three large supralabials (on the left side, four on the right) to the center of the eye; a prominent spine on the superciliary margin over the middle of the eye; head above and on sides covered with small elongate, strongly keeled scales, those on the snout largest; scales on back large, imbricate, keeled, seven to eight in the distance from tip of snout to ear; mental large, nearly same size as rostral; two

Coloration of living specimens.—Adult; U.S.N.M., No. 27007; L. Stejneger, No. 9045; Luquillo, March 4, 1900. General color tawny-olive, with indistinct marblings of darker raw umber; across the shoulders a wide, black band, edged anteriorly and posteriorly with whitish, and inclosing two pure white spots; underneath, pale isabella color; chin and throat, pure raw sienna; underside of tail suffused with russet; iris, brassy, overlaid with blackish, leaving a very narrow bright
! ring bordering the pupil. giovanni Another specimen (No. 27008, L. $., No. 9046) caught with the one just described was duller, the general ground color being more dull isabella and the dark markings darker Van Dyke brown; the rie. 5L_Sprmropac. ges of the shoulder band like the ground color, rytus Granpisqua-. but the two spots were pure white.

All the above specimens which were brought us by the children in Luquillo, and which were said to have been caught inside the huts and houses of the natives differed notably in coloration from the specimens which we ourselves collected afterwards, both in Vieques and near Ponce, under stones far from human habitations.
Three of the specimens on the beach at Vieques (Nos. 27142-4; L.&.,

<<<Page: 1148>>>

No. 9055) on March 26, were isabella-colored with dusky spots on back and upper side of legs, the tail similar but more ochraceous; the scapular band less extensive than ia the Luquillo specimens, and without white edges, in two specimens jet black with pure white spots; in the third, the scapular band was merely indicated, the great difference being in the color of the head including chin and throat and part of the neck which were uniform, unspotted, orange-ochraccous, approaching ochraceous-rufous, the black eyeball shining through the skin as greenish spots; breast, belly, and legs underneath, pale drab, and underside of tail, ochraceous. The fourth specimen (No. 27145; L. $., No. 9056) was entirely different; the whole upper surface was tawny olive with dusky irregular spots; on the shoulder, traces of the black shoulder band with the white spots; the head was of the same ground color as the rest of the upper surface, but with markings of a similar pattern as fig. 52; throat and chin with very distinct irregular dusky spots.
In the specimens collected in the white clay hills about 3 miles east of Ponce on April 16 (Nos. 27306-12) two similar types of coloration are also easily distinguishable, namely, those with uniform yellow head without dusky markings but with the tail spotted like the back, and those with an unspotted ochraceous tail but a drab-colored head with a pattern, like fig. 52, and longitudinal dusky marks on the back. In all these specimens the scapular band is limited to a black median spot.
Habitat.—Spherodactylus grandisquamis, which is the form with the largest scales, is confined to Porto Rico and Vieques. On the east it is represented in St. Thomas and the other Virgin Islands by S. macrolepis, with smaller scales, while on the west a form with still smaller scales is found on Mona Island. ethene ee eee
As early as 1863 Reinhardt and Luetken recorded — ryzvs cranpisqvaa large-scaled individual from Vieques and it has 3 7) yaa since been recorded from Porto Rico by various of head and shoulauthors as S. macrolepis. Mr. A. B. Baker in 1899 cd a collected several specimens near Isabella Segunda on Vieques, where we also secured a few in 1900. We also collected a large series in Luquillo, a small town on the main island just opposite, and later on some near Ponce, on the south side. I have also examined four specimens in the Hamburg Museum, collected by Mr. J. Michaelis at Arecibo in 1900. It thus seems to occur all around the island near sea level; it is probably confined to the lowlands, as we did not see it nor hear of it in the higher altitudes.

<<<Page: 1149>>>

Habits.—Like most geckos the Lucia or Santa Lucia, as the Spherodactylus was called by the natives, is probably nocturnal or crepuscular, as we saw none except such as we caught under stones or in other hiding places. The children in Luquillo brought us numerous specimens which were said to have been taken in the huts of the natives, though we saw none in the miserable shanty which we ourselves inhabited. On Vieques we found a few specimens on the beach near Isabella Segunda under the pebbles of surf-worn coral of the size from a walnut to that of a fist. In the white limestone hills east of Ponce we also
found them under small stones.

SPHAERODACTYLUS MONENSIS/¢ (Meerwarth).
1901. Sphaerodactylus macrolepis @ monensis MEERWARTH, Mitth. Naturh. Mus. Hamburg, XVIII, p. 20 (type locality, Mona Island; types, Hamburg Mus., nos. 1207a-b).
This form is diagnosed by Mr. Meerwarth as having 46 to 48 scale rows around the body and as having the scales on the upper side of the snout imbricate.
Through the kindness of the authorities of the Naturhistorische Museum in Hamburg I was allowed to examine the two type specimens. I found the scales decidedly smaller than in specimens of S. macrolepis from St. Thomas, consequently still smaller than in S. grandisquamis. The specimens are quite young and pale. On the smallest there are indications of the shoulder band. The scales on the chest are keeled.
FHabitat.—This species seems to be confined to Mona Island, where a couple of specimens were collected in 1891 by Mr. Bock and sent to the museum in Hamburg.

A direct comparison between the six typical specimens of J/. fulgida from Jamaica (U.S.N.M., No. 5759) and the specimen from Porto Rico here figured and described, for the loan of which I am greatly indebted to Prof. $5. Garman, convinces me that Bocourt and Garman are correct in regarding them as distinct forms. I can not agree, however, with Professor Garman in the nomenclature he proposes, following Boulanger, as he does, in ascribing the name JZ. sloandé (Daudin) to the Jamaican form. True, Daudin referred Sloane’s Lacertus minor levis, from Jamaica, to his Se7neus sloand: under the impression that it was the same species as the specimen he described as being in the ** Museum d’histoire naturelle de Paris,” without giving the locality of the latter, but we have Duméril and Bibron’s express statement to the effect that his type was collected in St. Thomas by Richard pére,“ and according to modern rules of nomenclature the name follows the type. It is consequently the Jamaican form which requires a different name, Wiegmann’s J/. sp¢/onotus being apparently available for this form.
I have been unable to find any character by which the Porto Rico specimen can be separated from typical JZ. s/oan77. The type of the latter has a somewhat abnormal arrangement of the frontonasal and the prefrontals, the former being very short and the latter broadly in contrast, but on the whole the St. Thomas form seems to be the same as the Porto Rican.
Professor Garman has pointed out the characters separating the two forms from Jamaica and Porto Rico, though I must add that one of the characters, namely, the alleged lower number of scales from chin to vent in the Jamaican species does not seem to hold, as in our series the number varies from 48 to 60. On the other hand, there is astrong tendency in the Jamaican form towards three pairs of nuchals. Of the six specimens before me there is only one specimen with two pairs of nuchals; two have 3 on one side and 2 on the other; while three specimens have three pairs of enlarged nuchals.
It must be admitted that no one single character seems to be absolutely constant, but it is believed that it will always be possible to refer a specimen to its proper category by a combination of the dominant characters. Thus, separated supranasals and three pairs of

nuchals seem to predominate in Jamaican specimens, while supranasals in contact and two nuchals belong more to the eastern form.
During my visit to Berlinin 1901 I was enabled to examine two interesting type specimens in the Natural History Museum there, thanks to the kindness of the curator, Dr.G. Tornier. They were Luprepes semitteniatus and FE. spilonotus, both described by Wiegmann from unknown localities. The latter (No. 3785) has three pairs of nuchals and the supranasals are not in contact, thus agreeing with the Jamaican form. The other (No. 5290), /. semiteniatus, has two pairs of nuchals and the supranasals are in contact; it has also 32 scale rows around the body. In these respects it agrees with J/. sloaniz, but the coloration is so different and so peculiar that I can not refer it to this species. On the head and anterior portion of the body there are two very dark brown longitudinal bands, with a narrow, light band on the middle line. The dark bands gradually taper off posteriorly, disappearing on the middle of the back. The lateral dark band is traceable to the groin.
Fras. 56-58.—MABUYA SLOANII. 2 X natural size. 56, top of head; 57, side of head; 58, underside of head. No. 6052, M.C.Z.C.

Variation.—This species, like all the others of the genus, shows considerable variation, especially in the head shields. Thus, the type has ¢ remarkably short frontonasal, behind which the prefrontals are broadly in contact. Sometimes there are only four supralabials in front of the so-called subocular, which in this case is the fifth labial. Garman states that there are occasionally only three supraoculars, and that the number of scales on median line between chin and vent varies from 60 to 63, but a larger series would probably show a greater variation. The normal number of scales around the body is stated to be 30.
The two specimens recorded by Boulenger from Mona Island have the supranasals touching behind the ventral without forming a suture; frontonasal broader than long: five or six supralabials anterior to subocular; 32 scales around the body; typical coloring.
Three specimens from Mona Island in the museum at Hamburg (No. 1476 a-c) have all two pairs of nuchals and two pairs of chin-shields in contact; in two specimens the supranasals are in contact, while in one they are barely separated. A fourth specimen (No. 1206) has the supranasals similarly arranged and in addition three pairs of nuchals.
fabitat.—This species, which is recorded from Vieques (Riise), Porto Rico (Cope, Peters, Gundlach, Stahl, Garman), and Mona (Boulenger, Meerwarth), must be quite rare now, as it was not seen either by Mr.

Mabuya sloanit occurs also in the Virgin Islands, and according to Garman the form inhabiting Haiti is identical with the Porto Rican species.

The family Teiidee, to which the Ameivas belong, represent in the New World the Old World typical Lacertide. Some of the species, like the South American ‘*Teju,” reach a considerable size. In places where the true Iguana does not occur, as in Porto Rico, they are often known to the inhabitants by this name.
Within our area only two forms occur, namely, Amecva eaxul, in Porto Rico and Vieques, and the form recently described by Boulenger as A. alboguttata from Mona Island. They are very closely related, the latter being plainly descended from the former. The main differences are as follows:

series of specimens from St. Thomas, the type locality of A.

Cope’s variety exul is only the young of the present species, and as his paper clearly has the priority over that by Reinhardt and Luetken (in fact they refer to it themselves) the name given by him must take precedence over A. rizsev.

ing to the inner and outer metatarsals; fifth (outer toe)extending as far as the first (inner); tail covered with keeled scales in rings, the scales being straight and the keels nearly parallel with the sides of the scales; about forty-three scales in the fifteenth ring from the base.

These dimensions are only those of a medium-sized individual. The largest specimen in our collection (No. 25570, from Cayo Santiago, off the Playa de Humacao) measures to the vent 160 mm. and to the tip of the tail 470 mm., but I am sure that some of the specimens of apparently patriarchal age which I saw in the city of San Juan near the quartermaster’s wharf were considerably larger.
Coloration of living specimens.—Adult; U.S.N.M. No. 27146; L. Stejneger No. 9057; Arecibo, April 3, 1900. —Ground color above of old skin (the specimen was shedding) ‘*pea green,’ of new skin more olive green, the difference being slight, however; underside pale “pearl gray” with a decided ws sh of ‘turquoise blue” on the groin and tail; dark markings blackish; eyelids edged with whitish; iris very dark brown. |
A somewhat larger specimen (male), U.S.N.M. No. 27221; L. Stejneger No. 9065; Utuado, April 7, 1900, had the ground color above tawny olive becoming olive gray on the tail; head not colored differently from back; lower back with a broken network of black meshes; flanks with a series of vertical black spots on a slightly browner ground alternating with a double or triple series of pale dots, which continue indistinctly on hind legs and sides of tail; tip of snout and of lower jaw pink flesh color; sides of head pale drab; underside whitish with a bluish cast, which is strongest on the sides and under hind legs and tail.
A specimen (young) (No. 27222; L. Stejneger No. 9066) from the same locality as the last had head and neck uniform tawny olive; eround color of back similar, but becoming duller toward the tail, which is drab above; ground color of flanks similar, though more russet nearer the light lateral line, especially anteriorly; sides of head and neck nearly uniform pale cinnamon; a narrow pale cream-buff line from superciliaries slightly broadening on the back and fading out at about the posterior third of the back, margined with blackish on both

<<<Page: 1159>>>

sides; on back and flanks a series of narrow blackish crossbars becoming obsolete on the lower back, the interspaces filled with roundish isabella-colored spots; lower back similarly spotted, as are also the upper side of the legs; tail above with these spots more faintly indicated; underside whitish with a turquoise-blue suffusion on both sides of abdomen and under the tail; underside of thighs pale gray dappled with white round spots like those on the back.
Variation.—In the large series of specimens before me (58) there is considerable variation in minor structural characters. Thus the number of superciliaries varies between 6 and 8; the upper labials between 5 and 8 (normally 6), lower labials between 5 and 6 (normally 5); the number of supraoculars is fairly constant at 4, sometimes one may be abnormally divided; in one instance the third supraocular is entirely separated from the frontoparietal by granules; the occipitals are of very variable size and shape, the median, perhaps, more often smaller than the next pair than otherwise; the central group of enlarged throat scales, or gulars, is of very variable aspect. The ventrals are nearly always in 10 longitudinal rows, and the transverse rows vary from 34 to 39, averaging about 35. The number of anal plates is by no means limited to 3. Frequently there are 5, two narrower ones being added, one on each side, to the two posterior plates, or even 6 when the anterior plate is divided by a transversal suture. Femoral pores, from 12 to 18 on each side; of sixty-seven specimens, three have 12; one, 13; eight, 14; twenty-five, 15; eighteen, 16; eight, 17, and four have 18, the average being 15.4 and the vast majority of specimens haying 15 or 16 pores.
The coloration is still more variable. Specimens with or without white dots, with or without stripes, are found in all localities. There are quite young specimens with comparatively few markings, but as a rule the spots and stripes become more and more obsolete with age. The pink color of the tip of the snout is also present in a varying degree, many having no trace of this tint.
Habitat.—TVhe ameiva, or, as this ground-lizard is generally though erroneously called by the natives,.the iguana, is common all around the coast line of Porto Rico in the neighborhood of water, salt or fresh, preferably where the ground is sandy or gravelly. In the interior it follows up the river courses, but it does not reach a high altitude. Thus, on the Rio Grande de Loiza the U.S. Fish Commission party found it as far up as Caguas, while on the Rio Grande de Arecibo we traced it to Utuado.
This species is also common in Vieques, St. Thomas, and the other Virgin Islands. It is represented in Mona Island by a closely allied form.

AMEIVA ALBOGUTTATA“ Boulenger.
1896.—Ameiwa alboguttata BoutencEer, Jahresber. Naturw. Ver. Magdeburg, 1894-1896, p. 112 (type locality, Mona Island; types in Mus. Magdeburg).—Mrerwartu, Mitth. Naturh. Mus. Hamburg, X VIII, 1901, p. 32, pl. 1, figs. 6-8 (Mona Island).
This form is so much like Amecva exul, from Porto Rico proper, that a detailed description is unnecessary. It will suffice to indicate in what respect the Mona Island specimens differ from the typical species.
The main difference seems to be one of coloration. Judging from the alcoholic specimens, the Mona form is considerably paler than those from Porto Rico proper. The white dots, as a rule, are more numerous and extend farther forward on the back to between the shoulders or slightly beyond, and it is probable that these spots do not disappear with age, at least to the same extent as in the old A. exul. There are young specimens of the latter, however, which are fully as spotted as A. alboguttata, thus, for instance, Nos. 25664 and 25667, from San Juan, Porto Rico. In the young A. alboguttata there is also present a more or less continuous white line between axilla and groin, but this line disappears entirely in older specimens, It is only indicated in a few young A. exw.
In spite of the great variation in the size of the scales on the tail it seems possible to establish an average difference between the two forms. In 31 specimens of A. evul in which the scales in the fifteenth tail segment from the base were counted the number varied between 38 and 54, considerably more than one-half having 44 to 48 scales, the average being 45.3. In the 7 specimens of A. a/boguttata at hand the scales in the fifteenth segment of the tail from its base numbered from 33 to 38, the average being 34.4.
The gular scales are exceedingly variable. As in typical A. exul there is a median enlarged group, but it is not equally conspicuous in all specimens. Sometimes it is fairly well defined, as in No. 29368; in others the difference between these median scales and the adjacent ones on both sides is so slight that they seem to form a band of nearly equal scales across the throat, as in No. 29869; while in others again the decrease in size of the scales from the median ones is so gradual in all directions that no specially differentiated group can be made out. Whatever difference there is in the covering of the throat in the two forms seems due to the scales surrounding the median group being on the whole slightly larger in A. alboguttata than in A. exul. The difference is one of slight degree, not of kind.
It seems as if in A. evul the inner row of enlarged tibials averages somewhat larger. In some of the Mona specimens this row is very
@ W hite-spotted.

<<<Page: 1162>>>

slightly differentiated at the lower end, but the difference between the two forms is neither constant nor well marked, and is at best an average one.
The same remark holds good with regard to the preanal plates. In all our specimens of A. a/boguttata a smaller but well differentiated plate is located on either side of the two posterior plates and a similar one in front of the anterior plate, but this arrangement is also frequent in A. evul, though not nearly universal.
There is an average difference between the two forms in the width of the plates on the upper arm. In A. evu/ they are considerably

No. 29368, U.S.N.M. wider as a rule, especially the upper ones, while in A. a/boguttata they are usually comparatively narrower, with a tendency to decrease in size gradually at the upper end, but intermediate and identical specimens are not uncommon; thus in No. 29372, from Mona, and in 27146, from Arecibo, Porto Rico, the relative size of the plates as well as their relationship to the ones on the lower arm are exactly alike. As to any distinction derived from the entire separation of the plates on the upper arm from those on the lower arm, or their more or less apparent continuation, there is absolutely no difference in the two

<<<Page: 1163>>>

forms. The plates are definiteiy separated in the specimens from St. Thomas, Porto Rico, and Mona.
Neither can I discover any difference in the situation of the nostril with reference to the two nasal plates between which it is located.
The difference in the number of femoral pores is a real one, although it is only shown in the average and the figures intergrade considerably ; in fact the range of individual variation in A. exul covers the extremes of A. alboguttata. Thus in sixty-seven specimens of A. eru/ from Porto Rico and St. Thomas the number of femoral pores varies between 12and 18. Of these sixty-seven specimens, 64 per cent have 15 and 16 pores, while 12 per cent have 14 and other 12 per cent have 17 pores. In sixteen specimens of A. alboguttata the number of pores varies between 12 and 15. Of these sixteen specimens, more than 81 per cent, have 12 and 14 pores. The exact averages are, for A. erul 15.4, and for A. alboguttata 13.3. Curiously enough there seems to be an aversion for the number 13, as only one specimen in sixtyseven of the former and one in sixteen of the latter have 13 pores. Although the series of A. a/boguttata is comparatively insignificant, it seems safe to conclude that the great majority of this form have 12 to 14 femoral pores, while most A. ewul have 15 to 16.
From the tables published by Mr. Meerwarth,? one might be led to suppose that there is a fairly constant difference between the two forms, consisting in the greater number of labials in A. evu/, as the average number of supralabials is 6.6 and of infralabials 6.1 in the latter against supralabials 6.0 and infralabials 5.1 in A. a/boguttata. This result, which is entirely at variance with what I have obtained, is probably due to his scantier material. At first I suspected that the discrepancy might he due to a real difference between the St. Thomas specimens and those from Mona, and that the Porto Rican specimens, of which he had none, might be intermediate. I consequently arranged my series from the three islands separately, with the following result:

It will be seen (1) that my Mona specimens agree with Meerwarth’s from the same island; (2) that my St. Thomas and Porto Rican specimens average nearly the same, and (3) that they also average the same as the Mona Island specimens. It seems therefore pretty safe to conclude that there is no difference in this respect between the two forms.

The specimen described by Boulenger measured from snout to vent 122 mm., and was consequently a much larger animal. It seems doubtful, however, if A. alboguttata reaches the same extreme size as A. exvul.
TTabitat.—This form, as far as known, is restricted to the small island of Mona.

The type of Ceélestus pleii collected by Plée and now in the Paris Museum is said to be from Martinique. Taking into consideration that it remains unique and that the genus is entirely foreign to the fauna of the Lesser Antilles, there can be no doubt that the locality is erroneous, like that of the majority of reptiles reported as having been collected in Martinique by Plée.
The next question is to decide to which of the known species the name C. pledi should be applied. Bocourt? has given a very fine figure of the unique type, which has every appearance of being accurate. — It shows a Ceélestus very close to our Porto Rican specimens, Cope’s C. degener. The only differences I can discover consist in the latter having the second upper labial higher and broadly in contact with the postnasal and an apparently larger nostril. The postocular and temporal scales are also different, being of about equal size in the figure, while in our Porto Rican specimens the postorbital series consist of quite small scales followed by a series of three very large temporal plates. It is very doubtful whether any stress should be laid on these apparent differences, which, after all, may be due to inexactness of the draftsman orengraver. The division of the prefrontal in the type of C. plei¢ as shown in Bocourt’s figure is probably only an individual aberration, a similar case being also recorded in one of the Jamaican species.
Knowing as we now do that Plée sent Porto Rican fishes to the Paris Museum, probably collected by himself on that island while en route to Martinique, we have every reason to believe that a number of his reptiles were obtained there also, the present species among them, and

Description.—U.S.N.M. No. 27066; Catalina plantation, northeastern Porto Rico, about 890 feet altitude; Mareh 1, 1900. Rostral squarish, much wider than high, followed by a pair of supranasals broadly in contact; a pair of fronto-nasals larger than the supranasals; prefrontal undivided, much broader than long, with a projecting angle in front and a straight border behind, the latter forming a suture with the entire anterior border of the frontal; frontal large, longer than the width between the supraoculars, but not as long as its extreme width at the posterior border, in contact with four supraoculars; no fronto-parietals; parietals large, about the size of the prefrontal, separated from the supraoculars by a smaller shield and from each other

the body, dorsals and laterals finely striated, not keeled, the average number of striz on the back being eleven; preanal scales somewhat enlarged; fore legs shorter than distance from tip of snout to ear opening; five fingers, short, third longest, inner one very short; hind legs short; five short toes, fourth longest, first very short; tail cylindric, ending in a point, longer than head and body, covered with scales like those of the body, the two median rows underneath very slightly larger than the others.
Color above (living and in alcohol) walnut brown, with numerous more or less interrupted and anastomosing dusky cross bands which do not reach the lateral longitudinal band. The latter is of a dark brownish gray with a sharply defined crenelated upper edge, gradually fading into the pale color of the underside which is clay colored washed with orange; lower lips and throat spotted with dark brownish gray.

Our largest specimen (No. 25528) is somewhat larger, measuring 101 mm. from snout to vent, but the tail is broken.
Variation.—Our four specimens are essentially alike, and the species does not seem to be subject to great variation. In the type the prefrontal seems to be divided, and in our number 25634 only three chinshields are present on the right side. The number of scales round the body varies between 34 and 38, two having 36. A rather young individual (No. 25634) differs chiefly in the head being proportionately larger, snout to ear measuring 8 mm. and snout to vent 40 mm.
Habitat.—So far as known this species is confined to Porto Rico proper, where it seems to be rare. The four specimens in our collection are the only ones apparently of which the exact locality is known. They were all taken in the’ coffee belt.
Habits.—Nothing is known of its habits. The one I collected I picked up from under a flat stone. Its movements were slow, and when grabbed by the tail it wriggled itself loose from this member without much effort.

The great facility with which many species of this genus are able to change their colors has earned for them the name American Chameleons, and the larger species are also usually known by the name ‘*cameleon” in the Greater Antilles, the smaller ones being called ‘‘lagarto.” The generic term <Anol’s, which is supposed to be of West Indian origin, might very appropriately be adopted also as the vernacular name.
The faculty of changing color is quite astonishing in some of the species. Thus the brilliantly emerald green Anolis evermanni turns in an instant to a dingy wax-yellow with various dusky markings. Under certain conditions A. gundlachi and A. cristatellus may appear entirely sooty black, and while in affect A. /rug? may lose its very conspicuous longitudinally striped pattern and become a semitranslucent olive. The brilliant color of the gular sack, or dewlap, of the males does not seem to be subject to this changeability.

The Porto Rican species of Ano//s are easily identified when alive or recently killed, their colors being in most cases quite characteristic.
Thus the large A. cuviert is not only easily recognized by its size and the peculiar flat, bony surface of the head as well as the separation of the dorsal scales by granules, but also by its more or less greenish coloration.
A. evermanni is also green, but it is a small species and the terminal third of the tail is black.
A. stratulus is more or less drab, brownish, or grayish, mostly with a double series of blackish spots along the middle of the back, and the dewlap, or pendant throat fan of the male, is deep orange.
A. cristatellus and A. gundlachi are also more or less brownish or grayish, though while alive many specimens, especially of the latter, are nearly black, but the dewlap is more or less tinged with olive or greenish in addition to the orange. A. gundlachi is, moreover, easily characterized by the metallic blue color of the *‘ white” of its eyes, and by the oblique series of bead-like yellowish spots on the flanks.
The three species A. pulchellus, krugi, and poncensis form a small group by themselves, characterized by the coloration, which is disposed in longitudinal stripes. Of these A. poncensis is at tan eee Gn ONCE distinguished by the lack of a distinctive color

With female specimens, as well as those preserved in alcohol, recourse must be had to the structural characters as contrasted in the ‘*key.” It is not always, however, that a single character is sufficient. Sometimes a criterion based on the presence or absence of a scale fails, mostly only on one side of the specimen, so that it is always advisable to examine both sides. Moreover, a specimen should always be compared with the detailed description to see if it agrees in the majority of characters.

The early technical history of this species is somewhat obscure. Cuvier briefly mentioned it under a French name in the first edition of his Régne Animal (1817), saying that it is from ‘‘ Jamaica, and probably the other Antilles.” A somewhat crude figure is added, and from the statement that he had ‘‘found berries in its stomach” it is plain
“To the great French zoologist G. Cuvier, because of his having indicated the species in the first edition of Régne Animal, 1817,

<<<Page: 1171>>>

that he had a specimen. On these meager data Merrem established the systematic name Anolis cuvieri, but Cuvier himself subsequently, in the second edition of his famous work, repudiated this name, substituting that of Anolius velifer. We added nothing to the original account, only eliminated the word ‘* probably” in front of *‘the other Antilles,” and reproduced the old figure. The following year, however, Guérin published another figure, without a description, under the latter name. Seven years later Duméril and Bibron give a very elaborate description, under the name of Anolis velifer, of the only specimen in the museum at Paris, the origin of which they were ignorant of, but suspected to be from the Antilles. No mention is made of it being the type of the species, or of Jamaica being its hab-

Neither is there any mention in Duméril’s Catalogue (1851) of the reptiles in the Paris museum of this specimen being Cuvier’s type, notwithstanding the statement on page ii of the introduction that ‘tall these types , so precious to the naturalist, who should always take them as standards of comparison, have consequently been exactly recorded in all cases in which they have been found.” Nevertheless, the probability is that they had before them Cuvier’s original specimen.
We next hear of the species in 1861, when Cope reported the habitat to be Vieques, and in 1863, when Reinhardt and Luetken identified specimens from Vieques and Tortola with Duméril and Bibron’s description. Afterwards specimens from Porto Rico were similarly identified

<<<Page: 1172>>>

by Cope, Peters, and Garman. When Boulenger published the second volume of his catalogue of lizards the British Museum did not possess any specimens of this species, and his description is apparently only ¢ condensation of that of Duméril and Bibron. It is consequently to be noted that no direct comparison of Porto Rican specimens has hitherto been made with the type specimen without locality in Paris.
Detailed as Duméril and Bibron’s description is, it is not sufliciently so for proving whether their specimen really is the Porto Rican form and not the same as A. ricordii, from Santo Domingo. So much is certain, that the characters which they rely upon for distinguishing the two species do not hold in any one particular. As a matter of fact, the two descriptions both fit Santo Domingo specimens, some agreeing with that of A. velifer, some with A. ricordii. It may even be stated that the character assigned to the former as particularly dis-

tinctive, namely, the greater flatness of the scales on top of the snout, is more characteristic of the Santo Domingo specimens than those from Porto Rico. Another distinction derived from the descriptions of Duméril and of Boulenger (namely, the scaling of the gular pouch, that of A. récordii being entirely covered with granules, while that of A, velifer (=cuvieri) is said to be ** nearly naked, with only a few lines of small oyalo-rhomboid, feebly keeled scales on each side” does not hold either, as it is only a sexual difference, the former being that of the female, the latter that of the male. Nevertheless, the two species differ quite sufficiently to establish their claims to separate specific recognition.
The differences between A. cuvier?, from Porto Rico, and A. ricord/, from Santo Domingo, though slight, are both constant and easily applied. The scales on top of the head seem to be smaller in the for

mer. Thus, whenever the individual scales can be made out, I find a series of scales between the two rows which form the frontal ridges, while in A. ricord77 the scales of the two ridges join along their whole length. In the former the scales which surround the occipital cavity | on the sides and behind are flatter, more polygonal, and distinctly keeled, while in A. ricordiz I find them to be undifferentiated, rounded, and tubercular, like the others.

scales on the sides of the tail are smaller in A. ricordii than mn A. cuvierr. At the level of the fifth ‘“‘ray” there are about 10-14 longitudinal rows and 3-4 vertical rows between the rays, while in A. r/cordi we find about 16-20 longitudinal rows and 5-6 vertical rows between the rays. In the latter the scales are also more regularly squarish, forming more regular vertical rows.
There may be other minor differences, but the above appear sufficient
for distinguishing the two species with comparative ease.
Any possible uncertainty as to the exact applicability of the name A. cuviert to the Porto Rican species is now set at rest, thanks to the kindness of Prof. Leon Vaillant and his assistant, Dr. Mocquard, at the Museum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris. In order to satisfy myself on this question, I sent them copies of figs. 87 and 88, representing the pholidosis of the tail of both species.

Description.— Adult male. Mus. Comp. Zool. Cambr., Mass., No. 6167; Porto Rico; Dr. Stahl, collector. Top of head flat, with only shallow depressions on prefrontal and occipital region, the scales being rather small and roughly keeled and tuberculated, even those on top of the snout, but especially those of the supraorbital semicircle and frontal ridges; about nine enlarged supraoculars, flat, keeled, and in contact with the semicirculars; supraorbital semicircles separated by about three scale rows from each other and from the occipital, which is barely noticeable; scales surrounding the occipital depression on the sides and behind rather large, flat, polygonous, each with a strong keel; six loreal rows, the scales composing the lower row next to the supralabials largest; one row of large keeled suboculars; 7-8 supralabials to under the center of the eye; temporals flat, with a low tubercle, all the scales of the sides of the head being more or less rugose or wrinkled; ear-opening rather small, upright, oval; back and sides covered with uniform scales tuberculated or keeled, separated from each other by one or more rings of minute granules; on the median line of the neck and back a series of about fifty triangular spines forming a saw-tooth ridge scarcely connected with the caudal crest; ventral scales about same size as dorsals, though more closely set, but not keeled or distinctly tuberculated except on the flanks; scales on chin and throat more elongate, distinctly keeled or tuberculated; scales on upper side of fore limbs larger than dorsals, juxtaposed or imbricate, keeled, becoming larger and multicarinate toward the hand; scales on upper side of hind limb similar, though less sharply keeled; scales on under side of femur slightly larger than ventrals, indistinctly tuberculate; digital expansion well developed, about thirtythree lamellx: under second and third phalanges of the fourth toe; tail strongly compressed, basal half with a high fin-like crest supported by about fourteen bony ‘‘rays,” the elongations of the neural spines of the caudal vertebree; scales covering sides of tail flat, keeled, those on the fin between the ‘‘rays” elongate, three to four rows between rays, about fourteen longitudinal rows on side of tail at the level of the fifth ray from the base; gular appendage very large, with distant rows of small tuberculate scales on the naked skin, the edge being rounded, thickened, and scaly; large postanal plates.

The adult female differs chiefly in having no fin to the tail, a smaller dewlap with the scales set more closely and uniformly, and in lacking the enlarged postanal plates. The upper edge of the tail is even, the ridge on the posterior two-thirds consisting of a series of rather flat more or less regularly hexagonal scales of nearly equal size surmounted by a keel, but slightly higher than those on the lateral scales.
It is a curious fact that the young of this species is unknown. Moreover, nobody seems to have described the young of the corresponding species, equally large and peculiar Anolis, which inhabits the islands of Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. As we know the adults of the other species, it is not possible that any of these can be the young of these giants, nor do any of them present structural characters which would strengthen a suspicion in this direction. The large species do not seem to be common on any of the islands, but that fact hardly explains why no young ones or even half-grown specimens have thus far been observed.
Colors of living animal.—Adult male; U.S.N.M. No. 26843; L. Stejneger, No. 9021; Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude; February 21,1900. Iris hazel, with a bright brassy ring bordering the pupil; general color above greenish gray; back clouded with brownish and sides with blackish dots, the dusky of the back and the black spots on the sides arranged in four perceptible, though indistinct, cross-bands; eyelids blackish, with a citron-yellowish spot above and behind the eye and a smaller one in front; under the eye a long semilunar white spot barely invading the posterior supralabials; several whitish spots on temples and sides of neck; underside white with darkgray mottlings and spots; dewlap delicately Naples-yellow, scales on the edge white; legs indistinctly crossbarred with dusky bands more or less spotted with blackish. Tongue pale cadmium orange, whole interior of mouth of same color, but duller.
During my absence three specimens, all males, were brought alive to Dr. Richmond while in Luquillo, two of which (Nos. 26999 and 27000) were colored like the above, while the third (No. 27001) was uniform emerald green when alive. In alcohol it is colored like the others.
Habitat.—This giant Anolis seems to be confined to Porto Rico, Vieques, and Tortola, but is absent on St. Thomas and probably also on St. John. In Haiti it is replaced by a nearly allied species, A. ricordiz.
In Porto Rico it occurs at least as high up as 900 feet above the sea. It is rather rare, since none of the Fish Commission parties obtained it. This scarcity can hardly be attributed to the mongoose, as it seems to live in tall trees rather than on the ground. As already stated, young and half-grown specimens are as yet unknown. Besides the specimens from the localities mentioned in the list below I have examined two specimens in the Hamburg museum, collected by Mr. J. Michaelis at Arecibo in 1900.

It will be noticed that the animal described and figured by me differs greatly from Peters’s original description of Anol/s gundlach?. The discrepancies are so many and so great that at first I felt quite confident of having a new species. My doubts were dispelled, however, when I took my specimens over to Berlin and compared them directly with Peters’s types, with which they are identical.
The present species in many respects resembles A. cr¢statellus, which also has a caudal fin and a brownish ground color. — It is easily told apart, however, by the more numerous scale rows between the supraorbital semicircles and between the latter and the occipital.
Description.—Adult male. U.S.N.M. No. 26903; near top of El Yunque Mountain, 2,863 feet altitude, February 25,1900. Head with two slightly diverging frontal ridges; forehead hollow; all the head scales keeled or wrinkled; rostral very low, narrower than the mentals; about eight scales in a series between the nostrils, those nearest the latter distinctly elongated; three to four series of scales separating

the supraocular semicircles, the lateral ones larger than the median series; occipital, much smaller than the ear opening, separated from the supraocular semicircles by eight or nine rows of scales, which are but slightly larger than the median dorsal granules; supraorbital disk consisting of about ten enlarged, polygonal, keeled scales in three rows surrounded by granules; three or four scales between the superciliaries and the supraocular semicircle bordering the supraocular granules anteriorly; canthus rostralis sharp, consisting of four or five elongated shields and continuous with the superciliaries which extend backward to the supraocular semicircle, though diminishing greatly in size posteriorly; loreal rows, seven or eight; subocular semicircle in contact with supralabials; supralabials 8, the suture between sixth and seventh under the center of the eye; temporals numerous, granular, witha bare indication of an enlarged supratemporal line; dorsal and lateral scales

The female differs chiefly in the absence of dewlap, fin to the tail, and postanal plates. The tail is nearly cylindric, the median series of scales above being only slightly enlarged and forming a scarcely appreciable serration. The full-grown female appears to be considerably smaller than the male, one (No. 27270) distended with large eggs measuring only 42 mm. from snout to vent. One of the eggs measures 11 by 5 mm. .
Variation.—The greatest variation is found in the size of the occipital and the scales which separate the latter from the supraocular semicircle, the number of rows sometimes being as low as five. These scales are always small, almost granular, and their increased number appears to be at the expense of the occipital, which is sometimes quite small and difficult to distinguish. In exceptional cases the median row of small scales between the larger ones separating the supraocular semirings is absent, in which case there are only two rows. The number of polygonal scales composing the supraocular disk is also very variable, there being often as many as 17 or 18. In some specimens, especially younger ones, the ventrals are less sharply keeled than in others.
Color of living specimens.—Adult male; No. 26903, U.S.N.M. (L. S. No. 9031); Camp El Yunque, 2,863 feet altitude; February 25, 1900. General color dark olive above, with five wide lateral nearly black cross bands, which barely meet on the median line, while on the sides they are very close together, being only separated by an oblique series of small yellowish spots; a wide postocular blackish-brown band passes above the ear and joins its fellow of the other side on the back of the neck; top of head densely marbled with indistinct spots of brown edged with dusky; edge of eyelids, semicircular line formed by the keels of the suboculars, as well as alternating spots on the supralabial sutures lemon-yellow; underside dull olive-yellow, chin bright lemon-yellow, the entire under surface densely marbled with blackish; underside of limbs similar, but paler; limbs above crossbarred olive and blackish, like back; tail similarly crossbarred, but

<<<Page: 1179>>>

slightly browner in the basal half or a little beyond the compressed elevated portion, followed by a median uniform blackish portion and a terminal part which is uniform pale brownish olive; feet nearly uniform dusky; dewlap very large, with thickened edge, the color of the skin being a dull orange-olive, the distant scales straw yellow; iris blackish brown; tongue plumbeous.
No. 26900, adult male, same locality, February 26, very similar, but the crossbars less well defined on the flanks.
Another adult male (No. 26901), same locality and date, on the other hand, was more deeply colored, the oblique strings of yellowish beads across the velvety black sides being very conspicuous. Eye deep indigo blue.
No. 26902, also an adult male caught at the same place and time, was nearly uniform olive brown when captured, but the pattern came out gradually and the body-color became lighter while being held alive in the hand; feet above black; chin back to the beginning of the dewlap bright orange yellow, the dark marblings on the yellow being Indian red. A pretty high cervico-nuchal fold of rounded outline.
A young specimen, No. 26904, same. locality and date as No. 26903, resembled the latter closely, though lateral crossbars and oblique bands of yellow spots were obsolete; a pale vertebral band extends from occiput to some distance on the tail, the black dorsal crossbars being hourglass shaped; dewlap present, but small.
Another young specimen (No. 26905) was uniformly velvety blackish brown above.
Numerous specimens collected at Adjuntas (1,450 feet altitude) during the second week of April] agree in color with those from El Yunque, including the yellow chin, though they did not seem to be as dark and velvety, the greater richness of the color in the latter locality being probably due to the greater humidity. The narrow bands of pale bead-like spots on the flanks, the yellow spot on the chin, and the dark metallic blue of the ‘‘ white” of the eyes may be regarded as absolutely characteristic of this species.
FHabitat.—This species seems to be confined to the coffee belt and the high mountain tops above it. In the western portion of the island it probably goes farther down than at the eastern end, where we found none at the Catalina coffee plantation, about 900 feet altitude, though it is to be noted that the United States Fish Commission party obtained a single specimen (No. 25723) on the slope of El Yunque, somewhere between 600 and 900 feet above the sea. At Utuado, in the west, it occurs, though apparently rare and not at the level of the town. There is no record of the exact altitude at which the types were collected, and the single specimen obtained by me during a diligent search for nearly a week (No. 27180) was taken in a side valley at least 100 feet higher than the town, consequently over 500 feet above sea level. At Adjuntas it was common in the coffee planta

tions, and near the top of El Yunque Mountain it was almost equally common in the original forest.

Description.—Adult male, U.S.N.M. No. 26803; Pueblo Viejo, near San Juan, February 14,1900. Top of head with two diverging frontal ridges, which, with two similar, but reversed and lower, prefrontal ridges, inclose a lozenge-shaped frontal hollow; head scales nearly flat, except those forming the supraocular disk, which are keeled or, rather, tuberculated; rostral low, narrower than the mentals, six or eight scales in a series between the nostrils; supraocular semicircles in contact with two small scales between them at the intersection of the sutures; occipital as large as the ear-opening, separated from the supraocular semicircles by three rows of scales, which are flat and

many times larger than the largest dorsal granules; supraorbital disk consisting of about ten enlarged, polygonal keeled scales surrounded by several rows of granules; two small and one large scale between the superciliaries and the supraocular semicircle bordering the supraocular granules anteriorly; canthus rostralis sharp, consisting of five elongated shields, the second one from the superciliary ridge being particularly large; superciliary ridge consists of one very long and narrow anterior shield followed by a double series of smaller scales which separates the supraocular granules above from those covering the lateral orbital region; loreal rows six, with raised lower edges; subocular semicircle keeled, separated from supralabials by one row of scales; supralabials nine, the suture between seventh and eighth being under the center of the eye; temporals granular, with a bare indication of an enlarged supratemporal line; dorsals minutely granular, the granules being pointed or keeled, with a bare indication of a median double series of slightly larger ones; ventral scales large, imbricate, rounded behind and flat or slightly convex, those on the throat smaller, more elongate and more strongly convex; fore legs above with sharply keeled scales, those on the upper arm smaller, those on the lower arm larger than the ventrals; anterior face of femur and underside of tibia similarly covered, the scales on the former gradually decreasing on the underside, the upper side of both being covered with granules like those on the back; scales on fingers and toes sharply carinate; digital expansion wide, about 20 Jamelle under phalanges ii and iii of fourth toe; tail moderate, compressed, the basal half above with a fin supported by about 14 bony rays; caudal verticels distinctly indicated by a vertical series of more enlarged scales, those between being pointed and smaller, in about nine vertical, somewhat irregular series, all imbricate and keeled; the scales covering the upper edge of the tail raised and spinous, forming a serrated ridge the teeth of which increase in length toward the posterior end of each verticel, about six spines corresponding to each verticel in the basal portion; dewlap large, with distant series of scales, the anterior edge thickened; postanal scales slightly developed.
The dermal folds on upper neck and back are present, the former quite prominent, the latter perhaps less so than in Anolis gundlachi.

The female and young differ chiefly in the absence of dewlap and fin to the tail, the female also by entire absence of postanal plates.
Variation. —The greatest variation is found in the head scales, the most important being in the relation of the supraorbital semicircles to each other and to the occipital plate. In the majority of cases the semicircles are broadly in contact across the interorbital space, but a small scale is often developed at the intersection of the sutures in this region, and it is very rare that not at least one pair of semicirculars touch. The number of scale rows separating the occipital varies between 2 and 4, the latter number but rarely, however. The enlargement of the two median rows of scales or granules on the back is variable, forming an appreciably raised line in many individuals, but almost absent in others. The height of the caudal fin is also somewhat variable, as it is not always the highest in the largest males,

but I believe it to be present in all full-grown males and do not at all understand the remark by Reinhardt and Luetken to the effect that the ‘audal crest is absent in specimens from Porto Rico and Vieques. In some specimens the ventral scales are more or less distinctly keeled. One of the individuals, a halfgrown male (No. 25777), from the island of Culebra, collected by the /Yshhawk party, differs at first sight so much from the other specimens of the same locality collected by Mr. Baker that at one time I believed it to belong to a different species. The scales separating the occipital and supraocular semicircles, as well as the enlarged scales forming the supraocular disk, are rather numerous, but these peculiarities are matched by various Porto Rican species, and a careful comparison of other points fail to discover any tangible differences. It is very light colored, with scarcely any dark mark

ings, but with a pale band along the middle of the back. It is figured (figs. 95-97).
Colors of living animal.—Adult male, U.S.N.M. No. 26803 (L. 5. No. 9011); Pueblo Viejo, near San Juan, February 14, 1901. Iris dark brown; edge of eyelids light yellowish; general color above bronzy greenish gray; head and several faint longitudinal irregular spots on the sides of the back more brownish; on each side of the median dorsal line between the insertion of the hind legs a better detined and larger spot of irregular outline, pale brownish edged with brownish black and a light line outside the dark margin; on the middle line of the tail a series of dusky spots located at the base of the largest spines; throat whitish; rest of underside suffused with greenish yellow, most intensely in the preanal region; dewlap greenish yellow verging into brownish orange toward the edge.
A younger male (No. 26805, same locality and date) was similar but darker, and with no definite markings of brown; tail cross-banded, light and dusky; dewlap fairly well developed.
An adult female (No. 26804, same locality and date) resembled the male, only browner, especially the supraorbital disk, which was almost ferruginous; median dorsal line paler grayish with a dusky shade on xach side; throat whitish with gray marblings; abdomen greenish yellow; no dewlap.
The coloration of the living specimens not only varies greatly individually, but to some extent also locally. Thus, as a rule, the specimens which we saw in Utuado were much more distinctly marked, the dark dorsal cross bands standing out in much greater contrast than in other localities. On the other hand, those collected in the white limestone hills east of Ponce were nearly uniformly drab without distinct markings. The specimens obtained in Vieques had the dewlap more brightly colored, thus in No. 27068 (lL. 5. No. 9053) it was green very broadly margined with brownish orange in strong contrast.
Habitat.— Anolis cristatellus occurs not only in Porto Rico, Culebra, and Vieques, but also on all the Virgin Islands, specimens haying been recorded by Reinhardt and Luetken from St. Thomas, St. John, Just van Dyck, Water Island, and St. Croix. On Mona it is represented by a nearly allied form.
In Porto Rico it is probably the commonest species, being found everywhere in the lowlands and in certain localities at least as high up on the mountain sides as 1,440 feet. The highest point where I met with this species was at Adjuntas, in which locality, however, Anolis gundlachi was the commoner species. The few specimens of A. c77statellus seen there were found on rocks near the river and in the town itself, but not in the woods and coffee plantations.

ANOLIS MONENSIS,/¢ new species.
Diagnosis.—Dorsal scales small, juxtaposed, convex, gradually diminishing from the median line, becoming granular before reaching the sides; tail strongly compressed, in the adult male with a very high fin-like crest supported by rays, much less than twice the length of head and body; ventrals imbricate, smooth; occipital large, larger than ear opening, separated from the supraorbital semicircle by one row (exceptionally, two rows) of flat scales; semicirculars broadly in contact; tibia much shorter than head from tip of snout to ear-opening; two shields between supraocular semicircle and superciliaries bordering the supraocular granules anteriorly; anterior femoral scales keeled; color very pale gray, with a dusky, transocular line.
101 \ 100 Fias. 98-101.—ANOLIS MONENSIS. 22 x natural size. 98, top of head; 99, side of head; 100, underside of head; 101, side of tail at level of fifth spine. No. 29387, U.S.N.M.
Type.—No. 29887. U.S.N.M. Mona Island, Porto Rico; collector, B. 8. Bowdish.
Tlabitat.—Mona Island.
Anolis monensis is closely related to A. cristatellus, and is possibly directly descended from the latter. The scales are larger throughout, hence the fewer rows on the loreal triangle, the single row between occipital and supraorbital semicircle, the greater size of the dorsai scales or tubercles, etc. The caudal fin is excessively high, more so than in any A. cristatellus, or even A. gundlachi, examined by me. The coloration is also peculiar, being of a very pale gray, with a distinct transocular, dusky line. In many specimens there is a distinct white line from shoulder to groin. The color of the dewlap can not be made out in the alcoholic specimens, but there are indications that it is different from that of A. eristatellus.
«From Mona Island.

ANOLIS EVERMANNI,/¢ new species.
Diagnosis.—Dorsal scales granwar or tuberculated, juxtaposed, slightly larger than the laterals, the median series not differentiated from the others, all much smaller than ventrals; tail slightly compressed, with an upper median series of enlarged keeled scales forming a serrated edge; digital expansion strongly developed; occipital shield nearly as large as the ear opening, separated from supraorfital semicircle by two or three scale rows; semicirculars in contact or separated by one row of scales; tibia less than length of head from tip of snout to ear opening, but more than two-thirds this distance; width of head as great or greater than distance from tip of snout to center of eye; granules on supraocular disk continuous with those on the eyelids across the posterior half of the superciliary ridge.
Type.—No. 26855, U.S.N.M. Catalina plantation, Porto Rico, 890 feet altitude; collector, L. Stejneger.
Habitat.—Porto Rico.
Description.—Adult mate, U.S.N.M. No. 26855; Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude; February 21, 1900. Top of head with two diverging frontal ridges, disappearing before reaching the nostrils, and inclosing a frontal hollow; head scales keeled or wrinkled; rostral
low, much narrower than the mentals; seven narrow scales in a row between the nostrils; one shield of each supraocular semicircle in contact, the others separated by one scale; occipital somewhat smaller than ear-opening, separated from the supraocular semicircles by three or four rows of scales; supraocular disk consisting of ten or twelve polygonal keeled shields, separated from the semicircle by one row

of granules; one large shield in front of the supraocular granules between the superciliaries and the supraocular semicircle; canthus rostralis sharp, consisting of five elongated shields increasing gradually in size posteriorly, superciliary ridge consisting of one narrow elongated shield and one similar but very small one, but not followed by a differentiated series of small scales, the granules of the supraocular disk continuing uninterruptedly into the granules surrounding the eye; loreal rows five or six; subocular semicircle keeled, broadly in contact with the supralabials; supralabials nine, the suture between seventh and eighth being under the center of the eye; temporal granules about the size of dorsals, a well-marked double series of small scales forming the supratemporal line; dorsals coarse, keeled granules, without any median enlarged series, laterals smaller but similar; ventral scales rather small, slightly imbricate, rounded behind, flat, those on the throat granular; fore legs above with small keeled scales, about three

series on the anterior face of the lower arm being greatly enlarged, more than twice as large as the ventrals; anterior scales of femur enlarged, keeled, gradually diminishing posteriorly and below; scales covering hands and feet above multicarinate; digital expansion wide, about twenty-eight lamelle under phalanges ii and ili of fourth toe; tail moderate, slightly compressed, with fairly well-marked verticils, every eighth or ninth vertical row being somewhat enlarged and surmounted by a strongly serrated edge of enlarged triangular spines, the fourth or fifth corresponding to the enlarged vertical scale row being larger than the others; dewlap naked, with distant series of scales, edge not thickened; postanal scales slightly developed.
The dermal folds on upper neck and back are very low, especially the latter, but there is a distinct depression between them on the shoulder region.

Female and young differ in the absence of dewlap and cervico-dorsal folds, the former also of postanal plates; the tail is more cylindric and the spinous upper edge less pronounced.
Variation. —As usual great variation is found in the size and consequent number of the head scales. The supraorbital semicircles may be in contact, though I have never seen more than one shield on each side meeting, but just as often they are separated entirely by a single series of scales. The supraorbitals again are separated from the occipital usually by three, often by two, but very rarely by four scales. The loreal rows are mostly five, often four, more rarely six. There are usually six supralabials anterior to the center of the eye, sometimes only five, occasionally seven. The keeling and wrinkling of the upper head shields and scales are also subject to considerable variation, being usually less pronounced in youth.
Colors of living animal.—Adult male, U.S.N.M. No. 26866 (L. 8. No. 9026). Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude; February 22, 1900. Iris, dark brown; eyelids, abruptly flesh-colored; general color, bright emerald green without markings; abdomen, underside of hind legs, and thick basal portion of tail below, pale glaucous green; terminal third of tail, black, tip, pale; dewlap, gamboge yellow; scales, pale yellow, no thickened edge.
When handled the animal changed from green to wax-yellow with numerous dusky spots and marblings on body and crossbars on tail, as well as longitudinal dusky stripes on throat; when reassuming: its normal color the dusky markings disappeared before it turned green.

No. 9022), from same locality, I described as follows: General color, changing from bright parrotgreen to almost dusky olive yellow, with faint indications of brownish, dusky marblings on back; terminal third of tail, blackish, extreme end pale; belly, underside of thighs, and thick part of tail, verging on pale glaucous green; throat and dewlap, wax-yellow; pinkish edges to the eyelids; iris, very dark brown with a dark steel-blue ring; inside of mouth, pale yellowish.
An adult female (No. 26867), same locality, is described in the notebook as like No. 26866, but with a very small dewlap not differentiated as to color. No soft cervico-nuchal or dorsal crests. The male has a

very low, curved nuchal flap and a still lower dorsal fold, with a distinct depression between them at the shoulders.
The young, as observed near Utuado, are pea-green with brownish spots arranged longitudinally with a pale stripe on flank from shoulder to groin, and one down the middle of the back, the latter interrupted
by spots of dark brown; underside, whitish.
change immediately to a more or less uniform brown. Habitat.—Like Anolis gundlachi, the present species is peculiar to
Porto Rico and has almost the identical vertical distribution.
When caught they
In the
eastern part of the island we found it on the slopes of El Yunque from about 800 feet up nearly to the top, while in the west we traced it
from above Utuado to Adjuntas.
Near Utuado I saw it only in a deep wooded ravine facing north, in which the animals of the higher regions probably descend farther down than in the surrounding country and
still more so than on the south slope of the mountain chain. Generally speaking, Anolis evermanné is confined to the coffee belt. List of specimens of Anolis evermannt. N xi. Sex and age. Locality.

Description.— Adult male, U.S.N.M. No. 26865; Catalina plantation, about 890 feet altitude, February 22, 1900. Top of head with two curved frontal ridges which converge anteriorly and inclose a shallow frontal hollow; head scales flat, except those of supraocular disk; five elongated scales in a row between the nostrils; supraocular semicircles separated by one row of scales; occipital equaling ear opening, separated from the supraocular semicircle by two or three
“Diminutive of stratus, saddled. ® An obvious typographical error, as the word, in a footnote on the same page, is stated to be a diminutive of stratus.

<<<Page: 1195>>>

rows of scales which are flat and as large as the ventrals; supraocular disk consisting of about ten polygonal keeled scales, separated from the semicircle by one row of smaller scales or granules; one large shield in front of the supraocular granules between the supercilaries and the supraocular semicircle; canthus rostralis consisting of five elongated scales gradually increasing in size posteriorly, the last two subequal; superciliary ridge consisting of one very long anterior shield followed by a very small one, the granules of the supraocular disk continuing behind the superciliaries into the granules surrounding the eye uninterrupted by any row of differentiated scales; loreal rows five; subocular semicircle strongly keeled, broadly in contact with supralabials; supralabials eight, suture between sixth and seventh being under the center of the eye; temporals granular in the center, bordered above by the curved supratemporal line of two rows of enlarged scales, being the posterior continuation of the subocular

semicircle; dorsals minutely granular, of same size as the laterals and with no median line of larger granules; ventral scales small, slightly imbricate, rounded behind, flat; those on the throat nearly granular, elongated, flat; fore legs above with small nearly smooth scales; scales on anterior aspect of femur enlarged, smooth, abruptly set off from the granules of the upper side; large scales covering the upper side of hand and feet feebly unicarinate; digital expansions large, about 19 lamelle under phalanges ii and ii of fourth toe; tail moderately compressed with distinct verticils, with eight to nine vertical rows of feebly keeled scales between; upper edge strongly serrated, five spines to each verticil gradually increasing posteriorly, the last one surmounting the enlarged vertical row of the verticil being greatly enlarged; dewlap naked with series of distant scales, edge thickened; postanal plates well developed.

Female and young differ in the absence of dewlap and cervico-dorsal folds, the former also of postanal plates.
Variation.—The variation in the head scutellation is as great as in the allied species. Thus, while in the specimen described the supraorbital semicircles are completely separated by a row of scales, in many others they are in contact, in some cases even extensively so, as, for instance, in No. 25532, in which two pairs of the semicircle scales are broadly in contact. In the large series before me they are separated in about one-half the specimens. In none is there more than one seale row between the semicircles. The single large shield separating the supraocular semicircle from the superciliary ridge just in front of the supraocular granules is remarkably constant, it being divided in two specimens only, namely, Nos. 26849 and 26990, and in these only on one side.
The keels on the scales covering the arms are often so feeble as to appear entirely absent.
Colors of living animal.—Adult male. U.S.N.M. No. 26807 (L. Stejneger No. 9007). Pueblo Viejo, near San Juan, February 13, 1900. Iris dark brown; general color above light yellowish eray, much lighter below; the saddle-shaped spots on back very pronounced blackish brown bordered by whitish; on sides an irregular series of burnt-umber brown spots, also with white margins; throat and adjacent portions of underside of neck of a delicate pale bluish green; skin of the dewlap deep orange, the distant scales canary yellow, those on anterior edge more whitish.
Another sale (No. 26865, L. S. No. 9027, Catalina plantation, February 22, 1900).—General color above grayish drab, the saddle spots blackish brown, and indefinite blotches and spots on sides cinnamon; edge of eyelids pale yellowish; a pale semilunar stripe on keels of suboculars; dewlap orange, the thickened edge pale greenish white; otherwise as No. 26807.
Halitat.—The saddle-spotted anolis is not exclusively Porto Rican inasmuch as it is also an inhabitant of the Virgin Islands, specimens being known from St. Thomas, Tortola, Just y. Dyck, and Vieques,

<<<Page: 1197>>>

It is also reported from Haiti by Prof. S. Garman, who mentions specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, as hay-
ing been collected by Professor Ackermann at Port au Prince.
It is
highly desirable, however, that the accuracy of the latter locality should be confirmed as no other collector seems to have obtained this species in Haiti or Santo Domingo.
In Porto Rico this species is most commonly found near sea level
and in the lower altitudes.
We found it still numerous, however, at
nearly 900 feet, and a few specimens were collected by us at Adjuntas and by the /7sh //awh: parties and Mr. Baker at the same place and at
Cayey, but it was not found in the higher regions of El Yunque. the whole seems to coincide with that of Anolis
cristatellus.
its distribution
It is also common both on Vieques and on Culebra islands.

The present species, together with A. pulchellus and A. poncensis, form a very natural group of Anoles characterized by their slender form, the longitudinally striped coloration, the strongly carinated scales in ridges on the underside, and the excessively long tail, which in uninjured specimens is much longer than twice the length of head and body. This character would have been an excellent one to separate this group from all the other Anoles in Porto Rico were it not that occasionally an old A. gundlach’ is found in which the length of the tail also is more than twice the head and body.

The females have merely an indication of a dewlap and a nuchal fold; they also lack postanal plates. The young are devoid of the dermal folds.
Variation.—There is a variation in the scutellation similar to that in all the other species, though perhaps of less importance in this species, as its differences from the nearest allies are to be found more pronounced in other features. Thus there is one single row separating the supraocular semicircles as often as two, and there is considerable variation in the number of rows on the loreal triangle (five to seven), of supra42

labials, ete. The number of rows of clearly differentiated imbricate keeled scales on the back is also variable to some extent, but they. always form a narrow zone along the median line of the back.
Colors of living animal.—Adult male, Cat. No. 26874 (L. S. No. 9023), Catalina Plantation, El Yunque, 890 feet altitude, February 21, 1900. General color bright yellowish olive-green, sides of back and flanks with minute black spots, larger on back, but none along the median area occupied by the enlarged scales; from under eye through ear to groin a broad and very distinct line of canary yellow, brightest, nearly lemon yellow, on middle of flanks; a black spot immediately behind eye, but no postocular band; underside paler, more buffy; immediately below the lateral yellow band the color is more olive, with minute black specks; hind legs posteriorly suffused with ferruginous; tail crossbarred with dusky; dewlap yellowish, gradually deepening to orange toward the edge; eye dark brown, nearly black, with a faint silvery edge to the iris; eyelids edged with whitish.
Another adult male (No. 26876, L. S. No. 9030), caught the following day on the same plantation, was in every respect similar to the above, but in addition the temples and the dorsal surface of the neck were densely speckled with bluish white dots, the equivalent of the black dots on the back.
The female, No. 26875, U.S.N.M. (L. 8S. No. 9029), same locality and date, was above dark olive-brown, paler on sides below lateral line; the latter straw-yellow, beginning on supralabials below nostril through ear to groin; color of sides gradually fading into pale vellowish on belly; edge of eyelids whitish. Scarcely any indication of a nuchal fold or a dewlap.
The specimens (6) which I collected at Utuado (altitude about 500 feet) on April 6 had the lateral stripe pure white and not yellow. The live colors of one were noted on the spot as follows:
No. 27157, U.S.N.M. (L.-S. No. 9063). Head and a broad stripe down the middle of the back, olive-brown; sides of back abruptly much darker, nearly blackish, bordered below by a pure white band extending: from snout over labials through ear to groin; below this olive-brown dusted over with black; underside whitish; behind eyeopening a conspicuous black spot; dewlap orange with white scales.
After death the dorsolateral dark band fades and is replaced by numerous minute black dots, while the neck above is dusted over with minute bluish white dots. In the large specimens the outline of the median dorsal band in life is straight, while in the young ones caught to-day it is strongly scalloped. In all six the lateral stripe is pure white, even in one which was just shedding, and extends to the groin. All the individuals seen were colored like these.
At Adjuntas (altitude about 1,400 feet) the specimens collected and observed on April 13 had the lateral stripe, which was distinctly

<<<Page: 1202>>>

defined all the way to the groin, of the same vivid yellow color as those observed on the Catalina Plantation, but one individual with yellow stripe which was kept alive over night had the stripe white on the next morning.
Tlabitat.—Thus far Anolis krug? is only known from Porto Rico. It resembles A. pulchellus so closely, however, that it would not be surprising if it should be found to have been confused with the latter in the higher altitudes of St. Thomas and other islands of the Virgin group from which A. pulchellus is recorded.
In Porto Rico itself this species is limited to the intermediate region between about 500 and 1,500 feet altitude, though in exceptional localities specimens may be found above and below these limits. We found it common at Utuado and Adjuntas, also on the Catalina Plantation, but it is not found normally on the coast plain, where its place is taken by A. pulchellus, nor on the higher mountain tops.

The type locality of Anolis pulchellus is given as Martinique, collected by Plée, but it can be asserted with confidence that the statement is erroneous, and that the species does not occur in that island, nor in fact on any of the Caribbean islands south of the Virgin group. It is only one of the many instances in which Plée’s reptiles were accredited in Paris to Martinique because shipped from this island. Plée collected both in Porto Rico and in St. Thomas, and from one of these islands the type has come.
Duméril and Bibron’s description of A. pulchellus agrees best with the form here so designated. It certainly does not apply to either of the species we call A. drug? or A. poncensis. On the other hand, there are a few discrepancies in the relative size of the dorsal, lateral, and ventral scutellation; but, although rather detailed, the original description is not sufficiently precise. I have not been able to compare my Porto Rican series with St. Thomas specimens, and there is consequently a possibility that they may be different, and that in the later case the name of A. pulchellus may be applicable to specimens from St. Thomas only. In this connection I wish to call attention to the possibility that although only one species of this group of Anolis is recorded from St. Thomas, namely, A. pulchellus, at least one other may have been confounded with it and overlooked. A large series of these lizards from the Virgin Islands is therefore a great desideratum as well as a direct comparison with the types in Paris.
This species is closely allied to A. Arug7, differing chiefly in the greater extension of the enlarged keeled scales on the back, in the much lower and narrower head which is covered with larger scales. In A. krug? the interorbital space is consequently wider with larger and more numerous scales between the supraorbital semicircles, and the loreal rows are also more numerous. The adult males are easily told apart, the A. pulchellus having the skin of the dewlap crimson, while in A. krug? it is orange.

The females have a mere indication of dewlap and nuchal fold; the young are devoid of both.
Variation.—The most important variation in this species appears to be in the size of the dorsal scales. Thus in the specimen figured the median dorsals are nearly as large as the ventrals, while in the one described they are much smaller. The single row of scales separating the supraocular semicircles is sometimes disconnected sufficiently to allow a pair of the semicircular shields to touch. The loreal rows
vary between four and five, exceptionally six, etc. The relative size of the scales on the interorbital space and in the frontal hollow is also variable.
Colors of living animal.—Adult male; U.S.N.M. No. 26799 (L. S. No. 9001); San Antonio, near San Juan, February 12, 1900. Iris dark brown; upper surface dull clay-colored, more dusky along the median line; head darker, more brownish; from eye to half way down the side of neck a broad black line, and another on the edge of the lower

<<<Page: 1206>>>

lip; a third blackish line, but considerably fainter, on lower edge of mandible, being more distinct between ear and shoulder; flanks and underside Naples-yellow, a stripe on upper labials over ear to shoulder more primrose-yellow; on flanks a series of oblique, elongated spots of brightest gamboge-yellow narrowly margined with black; skin of dewlap bright crimson anteriorly verging into dark rose-pink, posteriorly into orange, the distant scales arranged in rows and colored gamboge-yellow.
Three specimens (No. 26800-2) collected at Catafio, near San Juan (sea level), the next day were browner above and postocular streak less dark; no yellow spots on sides.
An adult male (No. 26809; LS. No. 9018) collected at Pueblo Viejo (also near San Juan and at sea level) on February 17 was above almost olive-yellow. gradually fading into the pale waxy-yellow of the belly; head nearly tawny ochraceous; supralabials to ear primrose-yellow; in continuation with this line a well-defined dusky band from ear to loin sprinkled minutely with gamboge-yellow and with several irregular cross markings of the same color on flanks; tail and limbs faintly crossbarred with dusky; a black postocular spot, but a dark postocular band is only faintly indicated; dewlap crimson as in No. 26799,
Another adult male, same locality and date (No. 26810), is similar, but color above more dark olive, strongly contrasting with the flanks, which are bright Indian-yellow; a few dusky specks in the olivecolored area.
In none of the above specimens was there any Jateral pale band beyond the shoulders. I have recorded two specimens, however, both taken at Pueblo Viejo, the same locality as the ones described above, on February 14 and 17, respectively, which had a light band on the flanks when alive. Of these, No. 26808 (lL. 5S. No. 9015) is quite young. Above rich tawney brown, with irregular dusky markings; upper mandible and a stripe over the ear to the shoulder sulphur-yellow, continued behind to the groin, but duller ochre-yellow, and bordered above and below by a dusky line; underside pale straw-yellow.
The other specimen, No. 26811 (L. 8. No. 9020), 1s quite similar to Nos. 26809 and 26810, described above, but upper side and flanks are rather densely speckled with blackish; the supralabial-supraauricular band is primrose-yellow to the shoulders and continues beyond as ¢ distinct gamboge-yellow band to the groin, the flanks underneath it being pale olive with yellow, dusky-margined vertical markings like No. 26799; as in all the other specimens, the dewlap is crimson.
Curiously enough this yellow lateral band, which in this species appears to be exceptional, fades out entirely in the alcoholic specimens, while it is permanent in the allied A. Arug?.
Habitat.— Anolis pulchellus, as mentioned above, is not confined to Porto Rico, but is recorded as numerous in the Virgin Islands, speci

The latter also has 1t from Vieques,
though neither the #Vsh /7Zawhk expedition nor I myself collected it on that island, and for some unexplained reason it may be scarce around
Isabella Segunda, the only locality visited by us.
Prof. S. Garman
also mentions specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, as having been collected by Professor Ackermann at Port au Prince, Haiti; but, as in the case of Anolis stratulus, this locality is unconfirmed, and no other collector has apparently found this species
in Haiti.
Is it possible that there is some error involved in Professor
Ackermann’s record and that the specimens of both species were actually collected in St. Thomas, although possibly shipped from Haiti?

Variation.—TVhe type specimen above described is rather extreme in some points of the scutellation of the head, namely in the wide contact of the supraocular semicircles, which probably are more commonly separated by a single row of scales, and in the single row sepa‘ating the occipital shield from the semicircles, there being usually two rows. No. 27290 is rather extreme in the latter respect, the occipital being broken up so that there appears to be three such rows (fig. 121.)
The degree of distinctness of the keels or wrinkles on the head scales is greatly variable, as in some of the younger specimens these scales are smooth or nearly so.
Color of living specimens.— Adult male; No. 27294, U.S.N.M. (L. S. No. 9068) type; 3 miles east of Ponce; April 16, 1900. Ground color above drab verging on tawny-olive on the tail and strongly washed with cinnamon on the sides; middle portion of back about five scales wide, uniform without spots, but on the sides of back and on flanks there are three longitudinal series of dusky spots on each side, about seven spots in each series from axilla to groin; these spots are not permanent, but appear and disappear at intervals; a pale supratemporal line, washed with pale rufous, from posterior edge of supraocular disk; below this an elongate blackish spot involving the eye and part of loreal triangle strongly tinged with tawny on the latter and on temples; edge of eyelids deep rufous; below the dark spot a pure white line on the lower row of scales of loreal triangle, suboculars and lower temporals to above the ear; several oblique whitish Fic. 121—Anours lines, which proceeding from the throat join on side

Three younger specimens collected at the same place and time differ in coloration in that they have a well-defined, nearly white median dorsal line, one whole and two half scales to three whole scales wide, bordered on each side by a wide blackish-brown band, which is a continuation of the transocular blackish patch seen in the adult; below this another, but very narrow, whitish line on the boundary between back and sides in continuation of the subocular white band.
Habitat. —Thus far this new species is only known from the type locality, 3 miles east of the city of Ponce. It was on the very last day of our collecting in Porto Rico that we almost stumbled upon this very distinct novelty. On the morning of that day Dr. Richmond went out alone collecting, as I myself was invalided so as to be able to walk any distance only with difficulty, and at noon he returned with a single lizard. This 1 at once recognized as an unknown species, and as Dr. Richmond fortunately remembered the exact spot where he collected it we took at once a carriage and drove out to the place, which is on the south side of the military road. On the side of a little hill, rising less than a hundred feet up from the coastal plain, and consisting of disintegrating coral limestone, we found a few additional specimens, mostly younger ones, among the scant grass and weeds. They were exceedingly agile, like Anol/s pulchellus, which was found in the same locality, but were not common.
Pemarks.—Though closely allied to Anol/s hrug? and A. pulchellus, the present species is very distinct, and much more so than these are from each other; in fact, its uniform covering of large, strongly imbricated keeled scales, with hardly any granules anywhere, is almost unique. The perfectly covered white dewiap and the coloration are also very characteristic.

There are certain indications that the large rock iguana which lives on Mona Island is different from what is usually considered typical Cyclura cornuta from Haiti, but lack of specimens from the latter island for direct comparison with our four Mona specimens makes it impossible to prove it at present. These lizards are scarce in collections, and in no one museum is there at present material enough to decide the question; in fact, there is only one museum which has specimens both from Haiti and from Mona, one from the former and two from the latter island.
The first character to attract my attention was the absence of an intercalary row of scales between rostral and nasals in all the known specimens from Mona Island, six in all, namely, four in the U.S. National Museum and two in the museum at Hamburg. Moreover, all our Mona specimens have a double row of scales between the median frontal horn and the last one of the prefrontal shields or horns.
In the Haitian or Santo Domingan specimens which I have seen, or of which I have record, these features are as follows: In the type (from Santo Domingo) described by Duméril and Bibron the series of scales between rostral and nasal is well developed; so I found it in the specimen in the Hamburg Museum (No. 1047); so also in the specimen from Gonaives, Haiti, in the Vienna Hof Museum (collected by Erber in 1878); and so Prof. S. Garman writes me that it is in the Haitian specimen in the Museum of Comparative Zoology (from Jeremie, Haiti, collected by Dr. D. F. Weinland). But according to a recent letter from my friend, Dr. Siebenrock, there is another specimen in the Vienna Museum from Haiti in which ‘‘ the rostral is separated from the nasals by a series of scales only laterally but not medially.” Consequently, out of six Mona specimens and five from
aKUKAos, ring; dvpd, tail. > Latin=horned.

<<<Page: 1214>>>

Haiti, one from the latter agrees at least partly with the former in the relation of the rostral to the nasals.
In our four Mona Island specimens (the Hamburg specimens were not examined for this character) the frontal median horn is separated from the nearest prefrontal shield or horn by a double row of scales. In the type of @. cornu*a there seems to be no intervening series at
a i touche a la protubérance frontale,”
all (“la troisiéme plaque Duméril and Bibron, p. 212); in the Cambridge specimen ** the horn is separated from the hindmost of the three enlarged scales by a single row of very narrow scales” (S. Garman in letter); according to Dr. Siebenrock’s statement to me the Vienna specimen from Gonaives has likewise only one row of intervening scales, and as he makes no exception for the second specimen I conclude that this is similar.
As will be noted further on, there may be other differences, more important, perhaps, though less obvious, but which have not been verified in the whole series. There is consequently very good reason for believing that the Mona Island iguana is distinct, and I would have hesitated but little to describe it as such were it not for Dr. Giinther’s description and figure of a specimen from an unknown locality in the Zoological Garden of London.“ These agree so minutely with the specimens from Mona that if his specimen did not come from that island the idea of the existence of two species would most likely have to be abandoned, for it must be admitted that the chances of a Mona Island iguana haying found its way to the Zoological Garden in London as early as 1882 are very slight, and it is certainly much more likely that it came from Haiti or Santo Domingo. There is of course a possibility that two forms occur in the latter island, one of which is identical with the Mona form, but the whole matter is thrown into such uncertainty that it seems best to await the accumulation of more authentic material before deciding.
In calling attention to the differences thus far noticed others may he in a position to judge better, and I therefore subjoin the few additional notes which I made in comparing the three specimens from Haiti and Mona in the museum at Hamburg. In the adult Mona specimen I found the enlarged keeled scales on the forearm much smaller than in the one from Haiti (ratio 20 to 12), the preauricular tubercles were much larger, also the median frontal horn; the two combs on the third toe were very large in the one from Mona, much larger than in the Haitian specimen.

Variation.—I have described purposely a young specimen, partly because it is the best preserved one in our collection, but mostly because the young show the individual scales and shields better than the older ones. In these, from age and excessive wear, and also because

so many of the head shields develop into horns and tubercules, the boundaries between the scales and their shapes become obscured.
The adults which reach a length of at least 1 meter are characterized by the enormous development of some of the head shields into pointed horns or cones, and the increase in the height of the spines which form the crests on neck, back, and tail.
Thus, in No. 29366, an adult male about 1.06 m. long, the frontal horn is 9mm. high and the lower preauricular shield has grown out to form a stout horn not less than 12 mm. high; the posterior pair of the prefrontal shields are also raised, forming hornlike protuberances; many other scales have their keels form sharp ridges or knobs; thus several at the posterior end of the superciliary ridge, the median preauricular, a smaller shield in front of the big lower preauricular at the angle of the mouth, one or two of the posterior suboculars and the posterior scales of the mandibular or malar series. The nuchal crest is very low, scarcely more than 2 mm. high, but the scales of the median dorsal series have developed into flattened, more or less falcate spines, the longest of which are 17 mm., while the spines of the ‘audal crest, which are stronger and broader at the base, measure no less than 19 mm. In this specimen the vertical diameter of the tympanum is 17 mm. and equals seven of the larger keeled scales on the forearm and ten dorsal scale rows. ‘The femoral pores are in two rows, with a few additional forming a third row near the upper end. Length from tip of snout to ear, 101 mm.; width of head, exclusive of preauricular spines, 75 mm.
No. 29365, another adult male, differs but little from the above, the main difference being that the preauricular spines are hardly developed. The femoral pores are arranged in three unequal rows, 18-19 in the anterior row, which is the longest.
The adult female (No. 29642) does not differ much, except that the spines are somewhat smaller; thus the lower preauricular spine is only 9 mm., the highest dorsal also 9, and the highest caudal 13 mm. The femoral pores are not large and are arranged in one complete series, with a second incomplete in the intervals between the first.
The number of dorsal spines seems to be quite constant, varying as it does in our four specimens only between 50 and 55, as follows: No. 29365, 50; No. 29366, 50; No. 29367, 51;. No. 29642, 55.
Habitat.—lf the present species is correctly referred to Cyclura cornuta, the habitat embraces the whole island of Haiti as well as Mona. In the latter island Mr. Bowdish found it among the rocks.

A number of names cluster around the original Amphishena ceca, described from a specimen said to have come from Martinique. Specimens have been mentioned and described from various localities in the West Indies or even in South America,’ namely, from the alleged type locality as given above, the Virgin Islands, Porto Rico, Haiti, and Cuba. Some of these have received separate names, such as A. fenestrata from the Virgin Islands, A. znnocens from Haiti, and A. cubana from Cuba. The characters assigned to the first and last of these are such that they have been recognized by most writers as distinct species, though it should be mentioned that Boulenger has expressed the opinion that the fusion of the ocular with the second supralabial in both type specimens of A. cubana (the only ones known at the time he wrote) may be an individual anomaly. This is not likely, however, as the U. 8S. National Museum has recently received two specimens from Matanzas, Cuba (Nos. 26363 and 26364), which in the relation of oculars and second supralabial agree minutely with the types. More specimens of A. fenestrata than of all the other West Indian species have reached the museums, and it seems that all those recorded from the Virgin Islands, with one exception, to be mentioned further on, agree in having the rostral produced so far backward as to completely separate the nasals from xach other, a peculiarity thus far not observed in any specimen of this group from any other locality. The exception alluded to above is a specimen in the Paris Museum, mentioned by Strauch ¢ and alleged to be from St. Thomas, having been obtained from the Copenhagen Museum. It is possible that there is a mistake about the locality, for it is not likely that Reinhardt and Luetken, in describing A. antz/lensis (= fenestrata), should have overlooked this specimen. On the other hand, the Copenhagen Museum may have received it since the

> Thus Boulenger’s Amphisbena ceca (Cat. Liz. Brit. Mus., II, 1885, p. 445), from Porto Bello, probably in Brazil, has later on been recognized by himself as not belonging to Cuvier’s species, and is stated to be the same as Boulenger’s Amphisbena ridley’, from Fernando Noronha.

publication of their paper on the nerpetology of the West Indian islands, in which case considerable doubt is thrown on the stability of the chief character relied upon for the distinction of the Virgin Islands species, as it is improbable that Reinhardt or Luetken would have parted with the specimen now in Paris if it were unique. The suegestion that it is only anabnormal A. fenestrata, however, is strenethened by the number of body rings, which is said to be 247.
Amphishena ‘nnocens from Haiti has been pronounced an unqualified synonym of A. ceca by such authorities as Peters“ and Strauch,’ both of whom had the opportunity of comparing the types of both species. Reluctant as ]am to question their conclusion without having examined the same material, I would call attention to the small number of body rings in the Haitian specimens, 211-215. and to the occurrence of only two small seutes behind the unpaired postmental instead of three. Moreover, a specimen in the U. S. National Museum (No. LOL68) from the Island de la Gonaives, off Port au Prince, Haiti, consequently not very far from the type locality of A. ¢anocens, shows these same characters (211 body rings, 18 caudal rings). In addition it has 18 segments above the lateral line and 24 below it. Another Haitian specimen (Hamburg Museum, No. 1983) is recorded by Meerwarth as having 211 body rings and 14 caudal rings; it has 16 segments above the lateral line and 21 below. Consequently it agrees closely with the others and differs in all these points from true A. ceed.
The whole question hinges essentially on the amount of individual variation to be found in specimens from the same locality. Unfortunately, not only is the number of specimens from each locality very limited, but not all the specimens known to exist have been described individually with sufficient details. The only minutiw given for nearly all the specimens are the number of rings on the body and tail. If we place these figures together it will be seen that in the specimens hitherto recorded there is a certain uniformity in those from each locality, with a perceptible difference according to the various localities, as follows:
Martinique (/) specimens (A. caca), 227-230 body rings; 18 on tail.
Virgin Islands specimens (A. fenestrata), 242-250 body rings; 13-16 on tail.
Haitian specimens (4. ¢nnocens), 211-215 body rings; 13-15 on tail.
That we have not to do with a curious coincidence only, due in a measure to the scantness of the material, seems certain from a consideration of the specimens from the Virgin Islands and from Porto Rico. Specimens from the former islands are more common in museums than the other species, about 10 being recorded in some detail, including the one St. Thomas specimen in the Paris Museum
«Mon. Ber. Berlin Akad. Wiss., 1878, p. 781. 6 Mél. Biol., XI, 1883, p. 405.

<<<Page: 1221>>>

referred to A. ceca by Strauch and mentioned above. In addition I have before me a specimen (U.S.N.M. No. 11715) from St. John, probably one of the types of A. fenestrata. In all these 11 specimens the body rings vary only between 242 and 250 and the caudal rings between 13 and 16. I may further add that our specimen agrees exactly with the other details recorded by Boulenger in his description of the 8 specimens in the British Museum, namely, 2 temporals, 4 to 6 preanals, 12 to 14 segments above the lateral line and 14 below in a ring around the middle of the body. Finally, Reinhardt and Luetken mention one temporal (or postocular) as an exception. Even if we include the so-called A. ceca from St. Thomas as an abnormal specimen, having the nasals contiguous behind the rostral, it will be seen that in this series of 11 specimens the individual variation is but very slight. This result tallies exactly with that obtained from an examination of 19 Porto Rican specimens of one species, the largest series yet compared anywhere, showing that these animals exhibit a most unexpected small variability in certain characters contrary to what was formerly believed to be the case.
An examination of the five specimens of Amphishena collected at Lares by Mr. Baker shows that they fall into two groups. The first, consisting of three specimens, has 221 to 280 body rings and 17 to 19 rings on the tail; 1 postocular+ 1 temporal; nasal suture short, not longer than portion of rostral visible from above, or entirely lacking, the rostral in one specimen being barely in contact with one of the prefrontals; color, darker. In the other group of two specimens the rings on the body are 249 and 251 and on the tail 16; a single postocular and no temporal; long nasal suture, it being about three times longer than the portion of the rostral visible from above; color, paler. Preanals, number of segments around the body, and postmental scutes nearly alike in both groups.
The fact that these specimens were collected in the same locality, and the evident close relationship of the two groups, at first suggested that we had to deal with a rather extreme case of individual variation. On the other hand, the correlation of such a great number of characters with no indication of intergradation, viewed in the light of the conclusions arrived at from a study of the forms collected in the other islands, convinced me of the specific distinctness of the two groups of specimens.
This conclusion, which I had arrived at before my visit to Porto Rico, was amply sustained by the material brought home by me or received since my return. This material consists of 17 additional specimens, 16 of which belong to the group having a short nasal suture, 1 temporal, and 220 to 230 body rings, while the seventeenth specimen is as typical of the other group, having a long nasal suture, no temporal, and 250 body rings.

<<<Page: 1222>>>

Comparing the first group with the recorded characters of allied species, it will be found to agree very well with those of A. ceca, which has 227 to 280 body rings, 18 caudal rings, 1 temporal, 6 preanals, 3 scutes behind the unpaired postmental, and short nasal suture.”
The fact that the types of A. exca are said to have been collected in Martinique is of no moment whatever, and it is pretty safe to say that the species does not occur there. It is now known that Plée, who sent these specimens to the Paris Museum, collected in Porto Rico, on his way, to Martinique, whence he shipped his material to Paris.

any other known form, and they "6s. 129-180.—AmpnisBzNa cuca. 3 x natBe . : ‘ ural size. 129, topof head; 130, side of head. will be deseribed further on under — xo. 97993. U.S. NLM.

Variation.—The amount of variation in the large series of 19 specimens before me is rather insignificant and affects chiefly the arrangement of the occipitals. They are always broader than long, but they are in contact behind the frontal as often as they are separated. One specimen (No. 25540) is rather more aberrant, inasmuch as the rostral is elongated backward somewhat unsymmetrically so as to touch the right prefrontal and thus prevent the contact between the nasals. In this specimen the temporal is also prolonged downward so as to touch the corner of the mouth with its lowest point. The number of rings varies only between 220 and 230 in a series of at least 20 specimens; the dorsal segments vary between 14 and 16, and the ventral segments between 16 and 18. The number of postgeneials is invariably 3, of anal shields 6.
Habitat.—The true Amphishena ceca has thus far only been found in Porto Rico, where it seems to inhabit the lowlands and the mountain sides, possibly as high up as 1,000 feet altitude. In the eastern end of the island we collected it on the Catalina plantation, on the northern flank of El Yunque, at an altitude of about 890 feet, while in the west Mr. Baker obtained it at Lares. Mr. J. Michaelis, in 1900, sent a specimen to the Hamburg Museum from Arecibo. We found it under stones, burrowing like earthworms, or in ants’ nests.

Variation. —Apart from a slight oscillation in the relative length of the sutures on the head the variability is insignificant. As in A. ceca, the occipitals appear most subject to variation, but they seem to be longer than broad, as a rule, even in the clearly abnormal specimen (No. 25537) as shown in fig. 184. The number of rings varies only

between 249 and 251 in the three specimens at hand, but more specimens
will undoubtedly show a greater range, though probably not more than
a difference of ten, as in A. ceca.
The ventral segments vary between 16 and 18 in our specimens, but otherwise the scale formula is constant. The eye is plainly visible in No. 27458.
Habitat.—Apparently confined to Porto Rico. The only definite locality whence we have specimens is Lares, where Mr. A. B. Baker collected two specimens. A third one was sent by Mr. Charles E. Adams from Porto Rico without any record as to the place where it was actually taken.
Remarks.—In addition to the characters pointed out in the key and diagnosis, this interesting novelty differs from A. ceca in several other points, the constancy of which, however, must remain doubtful till more specimens can be examined. Such are the elongation and broad contact of the occipitals and the lighter color, but the other characters, as demonstrated by the great uniformity in the large series of A. cxca, are suflicient to distinguish A. bakerz.

The blind-snakes are small burrowing snakes, smooth and nearly cylindrical, and covered with rounded imbricate scales of nearly uniform size and shape both above and below; only a few shields covering the anterior portion of the head are clearly differentiated from the rest. The eye is concealed under a large shield and may be shining through as a blackish spot or be entirely invisible. They have teeth only in the upper jaw, and there is no enlarged preanal shield.
At the first glance they resemble earthworms, and like these animals they live underground in self-made burrows.
Two species of blind-snakes occur in Porto Rico, one of which is here described as new. ‘They may be distinguished as follows:

Flabitat.—The true Typhlops lumbricalis extends from South America into nearly all the Antillean islands. Thus, it is recorded from Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Antigua, the Virgin Islands, Porto Rico, Mona, Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica.
In Porto Rico it has thus far been found only in the low land, not far above sea level. There are two specimens in the Hamburg Museum from Mona Island, collected by Mr. Bock in 1891 and 1894.

Variation. The individual variation appears to be similar in character and extent to that indicated for Zyphlops lumbricalis. Three of our specimens have 18 scale rows, the fourth has 20.
Hlabitat.—Thus far the only definite locality whence we have received this species is Lares, in the western part of Porto Rico. In this place Mr. A. B. Baker obtained three specimens. A fourth was sent from Porto Rico by Mr. Charles EK. Adams, but without indication of the exact locality where he collected it.
Remarks.—This interesting novelty resembles in color closely the specimens which Boulenger has described from Dominica under the name of Zyphlops platycephalus. The latter differ, however, by haying 24 scale rows around the body and by a much wider rostral which is said to be one-third the width of the head. Duméril and Bibron’s Typhlops platycephatus, which is said to have come from Martinique, collected by Plée, must be a very different one from the Dominica species. It is described as having 20 scale rows and it might consequently be suspected to be the same as our Porto Rican species, but apart from the radically different coloration, the true 7) platycephalus is described as having the head more depressed than 7) /umbr/calis and the posterior supralabials much lower, while, as we have seen, two of the best characters of our new 7) vostellatus are the lack of depression in the profile of the head and the unusual height of the posterior supralabials.
Soulenger’s 7. platycephalus” is apparently different from that of Duméril and Bibron and may be appropriately named Zyphlops domintcana, from the island of Dominica, of which it is a native.

The snakes of this genus belong to the Boid family, characterized, among other things, by the vestiges of posterior limbs, which are often visible on the sides of the vent as small, claw-like appendages. The Boas, as a rule, have undivided subcaudal shields and are mostly inhabitants of the New World. They are not poisonous, but kill their prey by squeezing it to death.
Two species occur within the territory covered by this report, one in Porto Rico proper, the other in Mona Island, both related to species inhabiting other islands of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas.
The two species may be distinguished as follows:

Seoane’s figure of Piesigaster boettger’ shows it to be based upon Porto Rican specimens (undivided prenasal; divided posterior prefrontals; irregular parietals) which is likely enough since they were collected by his brother, an officer in the Spanish navy. The young specimen figured by Jan (fig. B) is undoubtedly also from Porto Rico.

Variation.—There is considerable variation in the head shields, mostly due, however, to the breaking up of the individual scales than to their original difference in shape and proportions. The only young specimen examined by me (No. 12446) appears the most normal and is consequently figured here (figs. 151-152). The scutellation of the others can readily be referred to this model. The nasal is often undivided, possibly oftener

into pale brownish gray at the commissure; slight traces of rufous on rostral and other shields of face; iris silvery gray clouded with dusky.
No. 29583 a somewhat smaller individual (1,500 mm. total length) brought home by Mr. Bowdish is very similar in coloration, only the underside is more slate color, and the pattern much more distinct, the crossbars showing paler centers with blackish margins; the spots of the lateral series show a tendency to form a lateral blackish line on the anterior third of the body.
No. 27456 (1,590 mm. long), collected by Captain Hansard, died at the National Zoological Park on July 6, 1900, showed hardly any traces of bars or spots; general color above, chestnut, darkest on the median region and tail, gradually becoming lighter toward the ventrals; the latter brownish-slate color with pale edges; throat and chin mottled dull rufous and brownish slate; scattered obscure dusky spots on flanks.
Habitat.—This large snake is confined to Porto Rico, where it is found in wooded and rocky places of the foothills. It is now getting to be rather rare, so much so that neither the /%shhaiwh parties, Mr. Baker, Dr. Richmond, nor myself saw one during our explorations. Mr. Baker, however, saw the trail of them in the grass.
h. inornatus has been recorded unqualifiedly from Haiti by Bocourt upon the strength of a specimen in the Paris Museum. He gives no particulars, however, but there can be no doubt that it is the same specimen briefly described by Duméril“ as showing some peculiarities in the cephalic scutellation as well asa very aberrant coloration. Duméril himself seems strongly inclined to regard it as belonging to a different species, and to me it appears quite possible that the specimen in question may be a young /. fordii.
Zenneck? gives Cuba as one of the localities of /picrautes tnornatus and cites Bibron¢ as authority, but I have been unable to find any such reference. Asa matter of fact, Bibron’s work was published before Reinhardt described 7. ¢nornatus.

nasal and loreal; loreal large, longer than high and in contact with nasal, both prefrontals, preocular and second, third, fourth, and fifth supralabials; a large preocular with a subpreocular consisting of the detached upper half of sixth supralabial; seventh supralabial reaches eye; eighth supralabial separated from eye by a small subocular; no labial pits; five postoculars; temporal scales small, somewhat larger and more angular than the body scales; 42 scales around the body; 259 ventrals; anal entire; 79 subcaudals.
The pattern of the upper side of the body consists of two upper (dorso-lateral) rows of spots, which almost everywhere are connected with each other across the back; the dorso-lateral spots, which extend to the end of the tail, are of more irregular form than in 4. fordé, their number varying between 51 and 57; on the sides of the body, but not beyond the vent, there is a single row of rather large spots, which frequently connect with those of the upper side so as to form transverse bands; a rather indistinct postocular stripe seems to be a continuation of the lateral scale row; on the head there are but traces of markings except on the posterior part; the ground color of the upper surfaces is a very light yvellowish-brown in the young specimens, the markings very dark brownish-black; in the older ones the ground color is much darker, so as to make the markings less prominent.

The largest adult specimen (No. 2034b), with a defective tail, measures from snout to vent 1.010 m.
Variation.—According to Meerwarth the scale rows (in five specimens) vary from 38 to 48, the ventrals from 259 to 266, and the caudals (in two specimens) from 79 to82. Four specimens have 13 supralabials on both sides, one (No. 2034a) has 11 on one side, 13 on the other.
Tabitat.—This form seems to be confined to Mona Island. Notwithstanding the fact that Bock collected five specimens for the museum in Hamburg it can not be common there, for Mr. Bowdish, during his visit to the island in 1901 failed to see a single one. In his letter he assures me that it was entirely unknown to the few inhabitants now living there.
Remarks.—Never having seen a specimen of 4. ford/7 I shall pass no opinion on the distinctness of /. monensis. The latter certainly seems to have more scale rows (38 to 43 as against 33 to 37) and if
Ee. fordii always has one or more scales interpolated between the posterior prefrontals as indicated by Zenneck’s figures, they may be more distinct than Meerwarth seems to admit, as he makes 4. monensis a variety of 1. fordi.

<<<Page: 1237>>>

On the other hand, I would call attention to the fact that in many points 7. monens’s agrees more closely with Cope’s £. chrysogaster, from Turks Island, Bahamas, which certainly merits separation® if EF. monensis is entitled to specific or subspecific rank. Thus /. chrysogaster has 48 scale rows. It has 54 dorsal spots (4. monensis 51-57;
. fordii 69-78). The number of the spots is the cardinal point which led Zenneck to regard /. monensis as a species distinct from /. fordiz. It will be seen that 7. chrysogaster in this respect is identical, so much so that 7. monens?s and £. chrysogaster, to use Dr. Zenneck’s phraseology, are only different ‘‘Zeichnungsformen” of the same thing. He suggests differences, however, in the cephalic scutellation, and until that question can be settled it is the better plan to keep the different forms apart under separate names.
There are no specimens of this form in the U. S. National Museum, and I only know it from a cursory examination of the five specimens in the Hamburg Museum in August, 1901, when the above description was made. '

Only two coronelline genera occur in Porto Rico, both of which are very much alike. They may be easily distinguished by the presence or absence of paired pores, Or round translucent spots, near the apex of the dorsal scales. In the present genus there is occasionally found a single, more or less obscure, pore, but in the genus Alsoph/s the pair is very much in evidence, and can usually be seen with the naked eye.
Two species occur within our territorial limits, the chief distinction of which is the number of subcaudal shields. They may be identified as follows:

Variation.—Only one of the specimens examined shows any marked variation, namely, No. 26883, in which the posterior nasal is fused with the loreal. The number of ventrals (in 10 specimens) vary between 151 and 159, the subcaudals between 83 and 97 pairs. ‘The coloration is also fairly constant. In No. 25529, the largest specimen at hand (550 mm.), the spots on the median dorsal row are forming an almost continuous line; the underside is also less dusted over, the blackish specks being more concentrated in the lateral abdominal line, which is rather broad and continuous, and toward the middle line, where they form two lines of ill-defined spots. In No. 26883 (fig. 164) the median dorsal line of spots is but slightly indicated.

Color of Uiving specimen.—U.S.N.M. No, 26888; Catalina Plantation; March 2, 1900; L. Stejneger, No. 9042. General color purplish reddish-brown; underside whitish, with a pinkish tinge on the median line; markings (fig. 164) dusky; iris reddish silvery.
Tlabitat.—This species appears to be strictly confined to Porto Rico, and probably does not go much higher than 1,000 feet altitude. Some doubt attaches to the locality given for specimen No, 25529 (Adjuntas) and it was probably collected at a lower level.
Remarks.—This snake was first recorded from Porto Rico by Professor Peters on the strength of several specimens received at the Berlin Museum from Dr. Gundlach, wee but he erroneously identified — Fre. Haiti. 2x natthem with Dromicus parcimt si. ol pation around the mile of the Frons trom Haiti, of which he had no specimens for comparison. The latter species is very different, however, not only in having many more subeaudals (in 33 specimens 110 to 130), but also in a different color pattern, as shown in fig. 166.
As a matter of fact, the Porto Rican species, here described as new, is much more closely allied to Cope’s Dromicus exiguus from the Virgin islands, the chief difference consisting in the lower number of ventrals in the latter species, as will be shown under that heading.

Ventrals (in 19 specimens recorded) vary between 154 and 146, subeaudals between 79 and 86 pairs.
Habitat.—Thus far this species has only been known from St. ‘Thomas and St. John. During his visit to Culebra Island Mr. A. B. Baker secured a single specimen there. The probability is that it will also be found on Vieques. It does not occur in Porto Rico proper, where its place is taken by Le/madophis stahli, described above.
Remarks.—The only essential difference between ZL. eriguus and L. stahli seems to be the lower number of ventrals in the former. Altogether 29 specimens of both species have been examined and recorded, and in these the difference is marked and constant.

The species of this genus resemble those of Lecmadophis closely, but may easily be distinguished by the pair of conspicuous pores or pits near the tip of the dorsal scales.
The type of Bibron’s genus DPromicus is plainly stated to be Coluber cursor of Lacépéde, and 1). angulifer, therefore, can not be so regarded.
Two species of this West Indian genus occur within our territory, their distribution being exactly parallel to that of the two species of Leimadophis, inasmuch as one inhabits Porto Rico proper (and Mona Island), while the other is confined to the Virgin Islands, Culebra and Vieques. The chief difference in this case is not in the number of the ventrals, which is almost the same in the two species, but in the number of scale rows round the body.
They may be distinguished as follows:
a Seale rows, 17; fifth scale row without any distinctive color feature. A. portoricensis, p. 700. a? Seale rows, 19; every second or third scale of the fifth scale row particolored, the upper half being whitish, the lower half blackish (fig. 174). A. antillensis, p. 704.

1896. Dromicus sanctie-crucis BOULENGER, Cat. Sn. Brit. Mus., III, p. 634 (Mona I.) (not of Guenther).
From the above synonymy it might be inferred that the present species is most intimately related to Alsophis sancticrucis of Cope, as it has been made a subspecies of the latter by authors who regard A. antillensis as specifically distinct. Such is not the case, however. This treatment of the three forms is only due to the fact that both A. portoricensis and A. sancticrucis have 17 scale rows while A. antillensis has 19. But apart from the difference in the number of ventrals between the former, a character at least as important as that of the scale rows, the _A. portor?cencis and_A. antillensis are really more nearly related than either of them is to A. suncticructs.
«From Porto Rico.

<<<Page: 1244>>>

The question whether Cope’s A. melanichnus, from Haiti, is identical with the Porto Rican species can not be said to be settled yet. The scale formula seem to be the same, but it is not certain that there may not be other distinguishing features. It will be noted that the A/sophis from Mona is referred to the Porto Rican form without hesitation by those having had an opportunity to examine it, but it should be remembered that none of these authors had any Porto Rican specimens for comparison and that the identification is based entirely on the scale formula. Under these circumstances the whole question can not be solved until some one is able to compare directly large series from each of these islands. We have such startling proof of the effect of isolation working with a variable material to produce separate forms of these snakes that it is quite unwarrantable to lump the various names without incontrovertible proof.
Professor Garman” mentions as a good distinguishing character of the Porto Rican specimens ‘‘the narrowness of the lower postorbital.” This character is not confined to this form alone, as it is also found in Alsophis antillensis.
Description.—Adult; U.S.N.M. No.27766; Humacao, Porto Rico; spring 1900; L, M. McCormick, collector.—Rostral much broader than high, barely visible from above; internasal suture shorter than prefrontal suture; frontal broader than supraoculars, as long as its distance from the tip of snout, which is shorter than parietal suture; nostril large, between two large F16. 170.—Atsornis porTorIceN-

No. 27766, nasals; loreal moderate, trapezoid; one tgynwm. preocular, not in contact with frontal; two postoculars, the lower one very narrow; temporals 1+ 2; 8 supralabials, third, fourth, and fifth in contact with eye; fifth and following ones suddenly much higher than the others; five lower labials in contact
with anterior chin-shield which is shorter than the posterior; 17 rows of smooth scales round the body, with two conspicuous pores near the tip; 173 ventrals; anal divided; 128 pairs of subcaudals. Color (in alcohol) above uniform brownish drab, below whitish; each scale anteriorly tipped with black, posteriorly narrowly margined with black so as to form a regular network; ventrals, except on throat and neck, as well as the subcaudals, narrowly edged with black; a narrow blackish line emphasizes the suture bordering the supralabials above.

Variation.—The scutellation of this species shows very little variation. Of 44 specimens referred to it all have 17 scale rows; nor is it known that the number of labials, temporals, or oculars show any abnormalities in this large series. The ventrals vary between 169 and 183 (average 178) and the subcaudals between 112 and 129 pairs.
The coloration is apparently more variable. A somewhat larger specimen from the same locality as the one described above is colored essentially alike, and with these agree the type specimens from Porto Rico as described by Reinhardt and Luetken. Our single specimen from Desecheo Island (No. 29356), which is somewhat smaller, does not show the characteristic reticulation, there being only some scattered black edges to the lateral scales; the underside is whitish, with no black posterior edge to the ventrals or caudals, but the throat is densely speckled with blackish and there is an interrupted dusky line on each side of the abdomen on the lateral angle; the upper labials are white with numerous blackish spots near the commissure; a heavy black line across the rostral extends on each side of the face on the upper labial suture through the eye, continuing backward on the side of the neck where it gradually disappears as a series of ill-defined spots; there are also traces of a blackish line on the parietal suture with a posterior continuation as a median vertebral line. Mr. Meerwarth indicates a similar, though greatly variable, coloration for the large series of snakes from Mona Island.
Professor Garman mentions that on young Porto Rican specimens ‘*the dark-bordered scales are distributed in such way as to form irregular transverse bands, more indistinct in larger ones.”
THlabitat.—This species was originally described from Porto Rico proper, where it now seems to be comparatively rare, since none of the Fish Hawk parties, including Mr. A. B. Baker, nor Dr. Richmond and myself encountered specimens. The mongoose is probably responsible for this state of affairs.
The status of the snake living on Mona Island, especially with reference to the form occurring in Haiti, remains yet to be investigated. For the present it is left with the Porto Rican species. It must have been very numerous on that little islet, since no less than 38 specimens have found their way to the museums of Magdeburg and Hamburg. It is then quite remarkable that Mr. Bowdish, who visited the island in 1901, failed to hear of it there.

This species, as said before, differs essentially from A. portoricensis in having 19 scale rows around the body instead of 17. But while this is true in the vast majority of cases, there may occasionally be found a specimen with two scale rows too few or toomany. Thus, out of 78

specimens examined by me, or of which I have records, a single A. antillensis, from Culebra Island, has 17 scale rows. It would be difficult to identify this specimen by its scutellation alone, as its scale formula is identical with A. portoricensis, but that it is not the latter species is shown (apart from its habitat) by the peculiar color pattern of its fifth scale rows, which shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is only an abnormal A. antillensis.
Description.—Adult, U.S.N.M. No. 25554; Culebra Island; February 10, 1899; A. B. Baker, collector. Rostral much broader than high, barely visible from above; internasal suture scarcely shorter than the prefrontal suture; frontal broader than supraocular, about

Mention has already been made of No. 25556, from Culebra Island, the only one out of 34 specimens to have the exceptional number of 17 scale rows. At the same time it was remarked that this specimen is easily identified as A/sophis antillensis by the characteristic pattern of the fifth scale row—a feature first mentioned by Mr. Meerwarth: This marking appears to be constant, however variable the coloration may otherwise be. On the whole the coloration is much as in the spectimen described above, but in the smaller specimens there is sometimes an indistinct dusky vertebral line from the parietal suture backward, while on the posterior part of the body and on the tail the scale rows next to the ventrals darkens so as to form a more or less distinct longitudinal band.

Habitat.—Like Letmadophis exiquus, the present species does not reach Porto Rico proper, but is confined to the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, Vieques, and Culebra. It is absent in St. Croix, where it is replaced by Alsophis sancticrucis (Cope), and in Porto Rico proper, where the corresponding species is A. portoricensis.
Prof. 8. Garman records specimens of A. antz/lens/s in the Museum of Comparative Anatomy, Cambridge, as coming from Haiti. This is the only report from this island, I believe, and I can not be but very skeptical as to the correctness of the locality, in regard to which I refer to similar remarks under Anolis stratulus and A. pulchellus, pages 654 and 664.
Mr. Riise, who collected for the museum in Copenhagen about forty years ago, obtained specimens of this species from Vieques. Neither Dr. Richmond, myself, Mr. A. B. Baker, nor any of the other members of the /%shhavhk expedition met with it in that island, where it must now be rather scarce. On Culebra, however, the snakes are yet fairly common, and several specimens were collected there by Mr.
Baker.

Order CHELONIA.
The turtles of Porto Rico, with the exception of the pond turtle (Pseudemys palustr/’s), are strictly marine forms, whose limbs are specialized to the extent of having become paddles, the individual digits being externally obliterated, or nearly so.
Altogether only five species have been recorded from the islind and its coasts, namely, four marine turtles and one fresh-water species, each belonging to a separate genus. They may be easily told apart by the following

No Porto Rican specimen of the great Leatherback turtle being at hand, a detailed description of the species seems superfluous, as it can readily be identified from the general key to the turtles given above. The young can easily be recognized from the appended figures (figs. 175-178).
This truly oceanic species comes occasionally to the coasts of Porto Rico with the intention of depositing its eggs in the sand. Thus Bello y Espinosa reports that on April 19, 1869, a grown female was

caught, though he does not give the locality. It measured 2.08 meters over the curvature of the carapace. The color was of a plumbeous gray, with numerous small whitish spots; head and feet somewhat darker gray, the latter with whitish spots, the former with dark spots. It contained a large number of eggs.
It may be this same individual to which Dr. Stahl refers. He reports that in the playa of Dorado a ‘‘tinglado” was seen coming out of the sea; it immediately dug a pit, in which it deposited in a few moments 78 eggs.

Variation.—Vhe younger specimens have a more pronounced median keel on the carapace; the nuchal is wider, especially in front; first vertebral with longer anterior suture than the posterior and straight lateral sutures; the vertebrals are wider than long, nearly as wide as or, in the smallest specimen, even wider than the costals; the wrinkles and ridges are also stronger. The color above is darker, and some pale but obscure crossbars may be seen; two of the specimens have the marginal and costal sutures widely edged with a broad pale margin; the dusky markings on the plastron are more distinct; the symphyseal median pale line and the two lateral throat lines do not meet so as to form a fork.
[Tabitat.—The present species is recorded from Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and Porto Rico. There are indications at hand that there may be some constant differences between those inhabiting the different islands, but the material at my disposal is not suflicient to warrant an attempt to separate them.
In Porto Rico the species is found apparently sparingly in streams and ponds in the lowlands.

Genus CARETTA# Rafinesque. 1814. Caretta RAFINESQUE, Specchio d. Sci. (Palermo), II, no. 9, 1 Sett., 1814, p. 66 (type C. nasuta= Testudo caretta). 1836. Thalassochelys Frrzincer, Ann. Wien Mus., I, 1835, p. 121, (type Testudo caouana=T. caretta). 1838. Caowana Cocreau, in Sagra’s Hist. Fis. Pol. Nat. Cuba, IV, Rept., p. 31 (type Chelonia cephalo=T. caretta).
The generic name Caretta is usually credited to Merrem, 1820, and because Ritgen in 1828 limited it to C. ¢mbricata it has often been given the precedence over Fyretmochelys of Fitzinger. This is a mistake, however, for Rafinesque, as early as 1814, not only established the generic term, but limited it to the species he called @. nasuta, Which is nothing but the Zestudo caretta of Linneus, the Atlantic Loggerhead.
“The name Caret (New Latin Caretta) according to Lacépéde is the one by which the hawksbill turtle is generally known in the countries it inhabits. The derivation from cara, face, is doubtful. Carey is Spanish for tortoise shell.

The Loggerhead turtle is readily distinguished from the other marine turtles by having five pairs of costal shields, while the other two species with horny covering have only four pairs. The additional pair is situated’in front of the others, in contact with the first vertebral. No Porto Rican specimen being at hand, a young one from Florida is figured herewith, so as to help in identifying specimens.
This species is included in the Porto Rican fauna on the strength of Dr. Stahl’s testimony. It is probably not rare, but being of no commercial value it attracts no attention.

The green turtle is easily distinguished from the other Porto Rican marine turtles by the single pair of elongated prefrontal shields on top of the snout. The shell alone can be recognized by having only four costal shields and by the shields not overlapping posteriorly. The loggerhead (Caretta carctta) has five costal shields, while the hawksbill (retmochelys imbricata) has overlapping shields (fig. 198).
None of our expeditions to Porto Rico brought back any specimens of the green turtle, but its occurrence in the waters surrounding the

island is well known. Dr. B. W. Evermann, in his general report on the investigations in Porto Rico of the United States Fish Commission steamer /7sh Hawk in 1899, writes that it is rare except at the east end of the island, and he accounts for the scarcity of turtles by the absence of large areas of shallow water with sandy bottom.

As has been stated above, the generic term Caretta was employed by Rafinesque as early as 1814 for the loggerhead turtle. Its subsequent use by Ritgen, Gray, and others is consequently unwarranted, and the next one in time, Fitzinger’s Hretmochelys, must be accepted as the genus name for the hawksbills.

The hawksbill, which furnishes the valuable ‘*tortoise shell,” is superficially characterized by the horny plates on its back overlapping with their posterior borders after the fashion of fish scales or shingles. The accompanying illustrations (figs. 193-197), which are from a Porto Rican specimen less than half grown, give a fair idea of the external characters by which this species is distinguished from the other marine turtles frequenting the same waters.
The U.S. Fish Commission /7%s/ //awk expedition brought home several young specimens from Mayaguez, but Professor Evermann writes that this species, like the green turtle, is rare except at the eastern end of the island.

Honorary Curator, Division of Plants.
The Klamath Indians now live upon a reservation in the State of Oregon, which lies within a somewhat larger area occupied by them long before their discovery by the white race. The reservation is in the southwestern corner of the plateau of eastern Oregon, at the eastern foot of the Cascade Mountains and near the southern border of the State. The rainfall of the region averages only about 20 inches a year, the greater portion of the moisture that comes from the Pacific Ocean having been precipitated in passing over the Cascade Mountains. Most of the Klamath Plateau is covered by forests of yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa), but toward the east and toward the south are tongues of treeless sagebrush country (Artemisia tridentata and other species of the same genus) which extend along the valleys into the timber from the sage plains of eastern Oregon and northeastern California, while about the lakes and marshes mentioned below are several large areas, originally lake deposits, which are now raised above the surface of the water and are covered with grass, but which are still too wet to have acquired a covering of timber. That portion of the Cascade Mountains opposite the Klamath Reservation is made up largely of volcanic rock, covered by a layer of pumice gravel and dust. With such a porous soil the heavy precipitation in the mountains is not carried off by surface streams, but sinks into the ground and appears upon the plain at the base of the mountains in innumerable large springs of very cold and very clear water, which has filtered for many miles down the mountain slopes. As a consequence, the Klamath Plateau, although having a comparatively small rainfall, is nevertheless well watered and possesses some of the most beautiful streams on the continent. The drainage from these springs and streams produces two bodies of water, Klamath Marsh and Klamath Lake, which furnish a wealth of game. The richness of vegetable life, particularly in Klamath Marsh, is no less remarkable than that of the animal life, and the latter is in fact

<<<Page: 1275>>>

dependent upon the former, for the birds feed upon the seeds and starchy roots of the larger plants or upon fish or other animals that ultimately depend for their supply of food upon the minute algve with which the waters of the marsh and lake abound.
One of the plants growing abundantly in the marsh and less extensively in some of the bays of the lake, the great yellow water lily (Nymphaea polyscpala), was x staple farinaceous food of the Klamaths in primitive times and now is regarded by them as a delicacy (Plates 1 and 2). An opportunity presented itself to spend a week at Klamath Marsh in August, 1902, and to see the Indians harvest their crop of wokas (wo’-kas),“ or waterlily seed. The industry is well preserved in so nearly its primitive form that a detailed record of it has seemed desirable and is herewith presented. A wokas gatherer’s camp is shown in Plate 3.
It is estimated that Klamath Marsh contains about 10,000 acres of a solid growth of wokas. The plant is so vigorous and has such a habit of growth as usually to occupy an area suited to it to the complete exclusion of other characteristic and conspicuous marsh plants, such as tule and cattail. Certain plants associate themselves habitually with the waterlily, but these plants are for the most part submerged in the water, are inconspicuous, and subsidiary in their relationship to the waterlily, and in no effective or important way contest its spread. The principal of these latter plants are bladderwort (Utriewlaria vulgaris), mare’s tail (/ippuris vulgaris), and pondweed (Lotamogeton natans and other species).
Wokas is harvested exclusively in boats of the kind known as a **dugout.” The dugout (wuns) is hollowed from a single log, commonly of the yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa), and ordinarily is about 18 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 16 inches deep (Plate +). Sometimes logs of Douglas tir (Pseudotsuga mucronata) are used. ‘This tree makes a superior boat, but as the species normally grows at a higher elevation than the lake and marsh, it is less easily available to the boatmaker. The dugout is propelled usually by poling instead of paddling. The pole (la-gak’), made of a peeled sapling of the lodge-pole pine (/nus murrayana), is about 9 feet long and 1$ inches thick. The lower end is split for a distance of about 6 inches, and the two split points are then spread abruptly to a distance of about 4 inches, where they are held by the insertion of a transverse brace. In all the poles seen the

Secondary accents are not marked when they occur at the normal distance of two syllables from a primary accent.
oe 2)

brace consisted of a large wire nail. The triangular base thus formed presents a larger surface to the mud and often permits the pole to rest firmly across one of the stout rootstocks of a wokas plant. Paddles (ka-chik’) are seldom used in wokas harvesting, as the water in the wokas fields is rarely open, and when open is seldom too deep for the propulsion of the boat by poling. Within a wokas field the use of a paddle would be very laborious if not wholly ineffective, while the resistance offered by the plants in the water is readily overcome when the dugout is shoved by a pole resting on the bottom. In localities affording considerable deep open water, paddles also are carried. The other necessary implements in the boat are a flat-bottomed coarse tule basket (tliks) holding about half a bushel, and a large wicker spoon (niip, or se’-ot a-ko’-olkks) made of tule or willow.
When a boat is poled by a single occupant, she takes a position not in the stern, like a paddler, nor at a point a little aft of the middle, like an oarsman, but at a point a few feet from the bow, and for the most effective work she stands instead of kneeling (Plate 5). As the boat is poled slowly along among the wokas plants the woman stoops forward, and, grasping a full-grown wokas pod (ka-kal’’-ga’-li), pulls it off its stem and throws it into the boat. At this point occurs the first step of differentiation into grades or qualities of wokas. The pod when fully mature bursts open irregularly at the base; the white, moist, but mealy interior, as soon as it is brought into contact with the water begins at once a mucilaginous dissolution, and the seeds are soon scattered in the water. The seeds contained in these dissolving pods are more fully matured, larger, whiter, more palatable, and presumably more nutritious than those of the other pods, and consequently are much more prized and sought after by the Indians. They have a special designation, spokwas (spok’-was), which is applied also to the dissolving capsule itself and to the mucilaginous mass it forms when gathered, Spokwas constitutes only a small part of the whole gathering of wokas, and this fact, in view of the great demand for seeds of this quality, led to the question, Why do not the women gather only the fuily matured pods of the spokwas grade? This is clearly answered by the result of a day’s harvest of wokas pods. Ordinarily not more than 10 per cent is spokwas, a proportion due to the rapid dissolution of the fully ripened pods. If the women gathered only these, their day’s harvest would be very small, while by gathering the full-grown but still hard pods they get a several times greater product.
The spokwas pods, in a state of mucilaginous dissolution, are lifted from the water not by the hand, but in the wicker spoon already mentioned, and are placed in the tlaks (tlaks), or spokwas basket.
The wokas gatherer’s day is a long and laborious one. The women set out at about 8 o’clock in the morning and, taking a lunch, remain on the water until about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. They often go

<<<Page: 1277>>>

2 or 3 miles from camp. An hour or so before their arrival the various boats from any one camp may be seen slowly approaching from different directions, the boat itself usually hidden among the wokas leaves, its occupant seeming at a distance to glide over the marsh with a spectral motion, unaccompanied by any evident means of support or propulsion.
A day’s harvest, judging from actual measurements of several loads, is ordinarily 4 to 6 bushels of hard pods and a peck to half a bushel of spokwas. (Plate 6.)
The basketful of spokwas as it is brought from the boat is emptied into a pit dug in the ground for the purpose, to which each successive day’s harvest of spokwas is added. The disintegrating pods undergo some process of fermentation, which changes them into a mucilaginous liquid mass having the texture of a thin but very elastic dough. The pits are commonly 13 to 2 feet in both diameter and depth. The top is covered with grass, tules, or an empty grain sack. These holes may be found anywhere about a wokas camp, and from the inconspicuous character of their covering, among the miscellaneous furniture of an Indian’s summer camp, it is altogether too easy to step into one. If a motto were to be suggested for visitors, it might well be: Let the stranger in a wokas camp beware of the spokwas hole.
Other cases were observed in which an old dugout, a large spokwas basket, a grain sack, or even a wooden box was used as the fermenting receptacle for spokwas. Large holes plug themselves with pieces of the pods and small ones are sealed by the drying of the mucilaginous contents. In every case the receptacle was shaded, a fact which, taken with the limited diameter of the receptacle or pit, which never exceeded 2 feet, suggested that the contents were liable, under adverse conditions, to overfermentation and heating.
At the end of the period of harvesting by any individual, whether it is one week or five weeks, the contents of the spokwas pits are dipped out and placed in a dugout. Water is then poured in, the whole mass stirred, and the coarser portions squeezed with the hands, much as curdled milk is manipulated in a cheese vat. The seeds, no longer held in suspension in the mucilage, drop to the bottom, and the floating refuse, mucilage, and water are removed by skimming, by rocking the boat, and by baling. The wet seeds, with a small amount of mucilage and occasional small scraps of pod adhering, are scooped from the boat and spread on a tule mat (shtap’s) in the sun to drain. They are then ready for manufacture into lolensh and subsequently into shnaps.

<<<Page: 1278>>>

Fresh wokas seeds, in which the kernels are still moist, are in the condition necessary for manufacture into what is called lolensh (lo-lensh’). This condition exists in spokwas and in the two grades of seeds, nokapk and chiniakum, derived from cooked pods, or awal, described below. The dried seeds, lowak and stontablaks, can not be made into lolensh.
The fresh seeds are placed in a frying pan, one or two quarts ata time, and held over a fire for perhaps ten minutes, constantly stirred or shaken. This operation dries and partially cooks the seed, leaving the shell brittle and the kernel in a tough, elastic condition. In early times the cooking was done in a wicker tray with live coals, as described below under shiwulinz.
The removal of the shells is accomplished by grinding the seeds lightly on the ordinary mealing stone and then winnowing them. The lower mealing stone (Imach) is a piece of flat lava rock commonly about a foot and a half in length and about 10 inches in width. The upper stone (si-lak’-al-ish), also of lava, is much smaller and has usually two nibs upon the back which fit into the hands of the user as she sits or kneels on the ground. The seeds to be ground are placed, a few handfuls at a time, on the end of the lower stone next to the grinder. The seeds on that side of the pile farthest from her are spread out ina thin layer reaching to or beyond the middle of the stone. She seizes the upper stone in both hands and rubs it lightly over the lower and over the thin layer of seeds upon it. The forward stroke does the grinding, while the deft backward stroke serves to catch between the stones a small amount of seeds from the thin edge of the pile on the lower stone. The product of the grinding accumulates on the end of the lower stone farthest from the grinder and is shoved off upon a circular mat or very shallow, tightly woven dish, commonly known as a wokas shaker, described below, upon which the end of the mealing stone has been placed. (Plate 7.)
The notable feature of the grinding of these seeds is that the shells are cracked so that they can be removed, while the kernels, from the tough, elastic texture they have acquired through their partial cooking and from the lightness of stroke exercised by the grinder, are not cracked as are thoroughly dried or roasted seeds when similarly manipulated upon the mealing stone.
The next process is that of winnowing, by which the loose pieces of broken seed shells are separated from the seed kernels. The implement employed is a winnowing tray, known to the white people of the Klamath Lake region as a wokas shaker (p’a’-hla). This is a broad, circular, very shallow dish closely woven of a cord twisted from narrow strips of tule stems, from the great tule marshes of the Klamath

<<<Page: 1279>>>

Lake and Marsh country. The wokas shaker has commonly a diameter of 22 to 30 inches, and sometimes has some slight adornment in figures lighter or darker than the main body of the shaker. Ordinarily, Indian winnowing trays are of rigid construction, but the wokas shaker, which is the general winnowing implement used by the Klamaths and Modoes for the preparation of a wide variety of seed foods, is flexible, a characteristic which gives it a more varied usefulness than an ordinary stiff tray.
About a quart of the seeds, after cracking on a mealing stone, as already described, is placed on the shaker. This is seized by the operator in both hands, at opposite points of the margin, each hand, palm upward, grasping from beneath a radial fold in the margin, the end of the thumb usually extending up over the margin and occupying the inside of the fold. The woman sits with her back to the wind, and, grasping the shaker in the manner just described, proceeds by a series of skillful movements to separate the broken shells from the rest of the seed. One of these movements is the rotation of the shaker back and forth upon its own center as an axis. This accomplishes a general shaking up of the contents, through which the seed shells accumulate at the surface. A second movement is a circular motion of the whole shaker, which makes the seeds travel about in it like water in an eddy, the shells gathering in the center. The shells are then shifted to the farther margin by a jerk of the shaker, when they are tossed into the air and are carried away either by the wind or, when there is no wind, by blowing. The broken seed shells (tsi/-hlak) thus winnowed from the seeds are used in dyeing, in a manner to be hereafter described.
In the stage of preparation which they have now reached the seeds are known as lolensh (Plate 12, fig. 4). This may be made immediately into parched wokas or shnaps, or it may be spread out upon a mat in the sunlight to dry and then stored in sacks, to be parched later as used.
In the preparation of shnaps from shelled wokas kernels, or lolensh, the primitive method of roasting with live coals in a wokas shaker, as described under shiwulinz, seems to have been entirely discarded. The frying pan is now used instead by all the Indians. A handful or two of lolensh, either the fresh or the dried and stored product, about enough to barely cover the bottom, is thrown into a hot frying pan and roasted briskly over a fire until it is nicely parched and slightly browned, the pan being shaken meanwhile to prevent scorching. The kernels swell, crack their coats, and roll over like animate objects, but do not explode like popcorn. When the parching is completed the grains are roughly spherical, with a tuberculate surface (Plate 12, fig. 2), and the bulk of a mass of the kernels has increased two and onethird to three times. A thick-bottomed cast-iron frying pan is much better for parching wokas than a thin-bottomed one of pressed steel,

<<<Page: 1280>>>

a much more even and not extremely high temperature being thus secured.
The parched wokas, or shnaps, has a delicious flavor, somewhat similar to that of popcorn or, more especially, parched corn, When freshly parched it is more crisp and appetizing, and doubtless more fully digestible, than after it has been allowed to stand in a humid atmosphere and absorb moisture.
Shnaps is often eaten dry, and in this state it is most palatable to white people, but ordinarily the Indian places it in a dish and pours over it barely enough cold water to cover it. It is then eaten with a spoon, with or without salt, a modern innovation. Sometimes the shnaps is finely ground before the addition of the water, and the preparation is then known as shlotish (shlo-tish’). In primitive times the Klamaths used for eating wokas a spoon cut from the breast bone of the swan, which is conveniently shaped for the purpose. Their name for such a spoon is sh’o-kobh’.
The nearly mature but still hard wokas pods that make up the principal part of a day’s harvest are ordinarily spread upon the ground to dry, in flat-topped piles about 8 inches thick (Plate 8). Each day the margin of the pile is added to as new pods are brought in from the marsh. The bright sunshine prevalent at the time of the wokas harvest hastens the drying, thick and mucilaginous as the pods are, and in from one to two weeks those on the surface and margins of the piles are thoroughly dry. The pods thus dried are placed on a mat or piece of gumny sack and pounded with a stone or short pestle (ska). The seeds are thoroughly dry and drop out easily, and when the mass is sufficiently pounded portions of it are placed on a shaker and the light corky or pithy pieces of the pods are winnowed out. Some of the women, before winnowing the seed on a shaker, separate the coarser pieces of waste matter by running the whole mass through a coarse wicker sifter (ti-a’). Seeds thus prepared from dried pods and still covered by their shells are known as lo-wak’ (Plate 12, fig. 1). They are commonly stored in sacks for winter use. The screenings (kakt-chi’-as) from lowak, though made up mostly of the light corky pieces of the dry body of the pods, do contain a small percentage of seeds. They were sometimes stored, in the old days, for use in case
of famine. STONTABLAKS.
In the preparation of lowak, the pods in the interior of the drying piles do not dry, but turn into a soft, moist, rotten mass (Plate 9), the seeds themselves, however, retaining their freshness. When the piles are opened the dry pods are thrown in a pile by themselves to be made into lowak, but these moist, decomposing pods are differently

<<<Page: 1281>>>

treated and produce a superior grade of seed having a different name, stontablaks (stont’’-a’-blaks). The rotten pods, denuded of their covering of dry ones, are pounded to a pulpy mass with a ska. According to information from the Indians, the pounded pulp is further exposed until dry, and is then screened and winnowed, being thus left in the same form as lowak, suitable for cooking as shiwulinz, but not as lolensh and shnaps. SHIWULINZ.
When required for cooking, the dried seeds, either lowak or stontablaks, are first roasted, shell and all, then cracked, and the shells winnowed out from the broken seeds on ashaker. The seeds, called in this condition shi’-wu-linz (Plate 12, fig. 3), are then boiled, forming a sort of mush to which the Indians apply the same name.
The word is derived from shi’-wi, meaning to shake or winnow, and refers to the winnowing of the shells from the cracked seeds. Among the younger women the cracking is often done in a hand coffee mill, but the usual instrument is the primitive mealing stone.
The roasting of lowak, preparatory to the making of shiwulinz, is now usually done in a frying pan, but the primitive method of roasting with live coals in a wokas shaker is still occasionally used by some of the old people. This operation, as witnessed at one of the wokas camps on Klamath Marsh, is conducted as follows: About 3 quarts of lowak were placed in a shaker and several pieces of live coal from a lodge pole pine fire were laid on top of the seeds. Most of the coals were 1 inch or less in diameter; a few were 3 or 4 inches long and 2 or 3 inches thick. The seeds and coals were then tossed so as to roll over and over each other in the shaker, the contents going into the air from the farther margin of the shaker and falling in the middle. After a few minutes the coals began to cool. They were then brought to the top of the mass of seeds by a rotary motion, the shaker was set on the ground, and a little vigorous fanning with another empty shaker soon brought the coals to a lively heat. Then the tossing went on again as before until the roasting was completed. The whole process requires dexterity, both to keep the coals in motion so that the shaker will not burn and to roast the seeds evenly without scorching them.
Another form of food prepared from lowak is named stilinsh (stil’insh). This differs from shiwulinz in that the shells are not winnowed out on a shaker, but are skimmed from the boiling pot while the seeds are cooking. The name is derived from sti-lin’, to skim, a word now applied to various operations, from the removal of cream from milk to the washing of gold in a miner’s pan. In earlier times a food named talwas (tal/-was) was prepared from lowak. This was essentially the same as shiwulinz and stilinsh, but the boiling was done in a water-tight basket into which hot stones were dropped, a method of cooking not practiced among the Klamaths at the present day.

When seeds are required to be extracted from freshly gathered pods, either to furnish an immediate food supply, or to secure material for the preparation of shnaps, or because the wokas gatherer is nearing the end of his harvest and can not wait for the pods to dry, a process of cooking or steaming the pods is employed which facilitates the extraction of the seeds. These cooked pods are known as awal (a’-wal). The process of making awal, as observed at one of the camps on the east side of the Klamath Marsh, was a follows: Two pine sticks about 5 feet long and 4 to 5 inches in diameter were laid parallel, 4 feet apart, upon the ground. Upon these and at right angles to them are laid close together a row of cross sticks 2 to 4 inches in diameter, making a low platform about + feet square. Upon this platform was placed about 3 bushels of fresbly gathered wokas pods, forming a low pyramidal pile about a foot deep in the middle (Plate 10). The space between the cross sticks and the ground was stuffed loosely with dry needles of the yellow pine (2nus ponderosa), which were then lighted. A dense column of smoke rose high in the air, for awal is made only on calm days. The cross sticks soon ignited, and the blaze reached through the cracks to the wokas pods. In ten minutes the lowermost and outermost pods, sizzing and singing from the steam generated in them, were considered sufficiently cooked. The cross sticks were spread open a little and the cooked pods fell through to the ground, making room for the spreading out of the raw ones from the upper part of the pile. After five minutes more some of the burning cross sticks were pried upward through the steaming pods and left still burning on the top. Pods with their surface blackened by the fire were left upon the ground, but any green ones that fell off were thrown back again. In ten minutes more all the cross sticks had been brought to the top of the pile of pods and were roasting them from above. The Indian woman who was conducting the operation poked continuously around the margin with a pole to get the cooked pods out, occasionally removing one of the charred hot sticks, until at the end of an hour from the time of lighting all the sticks had been removed and the cooking was completed.
The awal is separated after cooking into two grades, based on the degree of maturity of the seeds. The better one (no’-kapk) makes up ordinarily much the larger part of the awal, while the poorer grade (chin-i’-a-ktim) consists of the smaller and more shriveled pods. In separating the two the woman tosses the large plump pods directly into the nokapk pile, but coming occasionally to a doubtful one she breaks it open, and from the appearance of the seeds themselves decides into which pile to put it.

<<<Page: 1283>>>

In wokas pods properly roasted as awal the interior tissues are in the condition of a mucilaginous paste. The seeds do not separate from this paste as readily as they do from the mucilage in pods of the spokwas grade, and therefore the Indian has invented another method of extracting them. This method is known as diachas (di-ii’’-chiis’). About a peck of awal, of either the nokapk or the chiniakum grade, is placed upon a sack or upon a hard smooth area of bare ground and pounded with a small stone (ska) into a gluey mass. To this is added about half the quantity of dry rotten wood (mu-lo’) of a sort that is easily crumbled into dust. This is pounded and rubbed into the mass of pounded pods (Plate 11). Finely pulverized charcoal or ashes is often substituted for the rotten wood when the latter is not readily obtainable. After the manipulation is sufficient to take up the moisture and leave the surface of the seed dry and free about three quarts of the mixture is usually placed in a wicker screening basket (ti-a’) and the empty ‘apsule skins screened out, the finer matter falling through into a wokas shaker. Sometimes a secreen is not used. The material in such case is placed directly in a shaker, and the skins, after being brought to the top by rotating, are shoved off. The winnowing of the seeds, as in the preparation of lowak, follows, and the seeds are then made into lolensh by the process already described.
Inquiry among the Indians as to the relative quality of the different kinds of wokas, irrespective of the method of cooking, but on the basis of what in the grain trade would be called grade, elicited replies showing the following order: (1) Spokwas, (2) stontablaks, (3) lowak, (4) nokapk, (5) chiniakum.
The significance of this arrangement of grades by the Indians lies in the fact that the sequence they gave represents exactly the relative degree of maturity of the seeds. In chiniakum and nokapk the seeds in the still green pods are roasted at once, usually on the day after they are gathered, and of these two grades the one called chiniakum is visibly the less fully developed. In lowak the seeds have several days longer to grow, since between the time when the pods are spread out in the drying piles and the time when they actually become dry the seeds are undoubtedly making considerable progress toward maturity. The stontablaks, lying in the center of the drying piles, and therefore remaining moist for a longer time than the pods on the surfaces of the piles, have a still further opportunity for the development of their seeds, and in spokwas the seeds are of course fully matured when they are gathered,

In the preparation of lolensh and of shiwulinz the broken seed shells (tsi’-hlak) are winnowed, as already described, from the seed kernels. These seed shells or hulls are not always thrown away, but they are often saved for a later curious use. In the manufacture of their finer baskets and trays the Klamaths use for both warp and weft cords twisted from the split outer surface of the tule (Sc/rpus lacustris). Upon the main body of the basket as woven from these cords are overlaid various designs in white, black, yellow, and maroon. The patterns in black are made from the same material as the body of the baskets, split tule stems, which have been colored by a certain dyeing process. Ordinarily this is accomplished by immersing the tule stems in the black mud of sluggish springs containing iron. A superior color, however, is obtained by the addition of a quantity of wokas hulls, which contain a large amount of tannin. The same result is now frequently secured among these Indians by prolonged soaking of the tule stems in an iron kettle, in water containing a liberal amount of the hulls. The color is evidently due to the development of tannate of iron. Samples of the wokas hulls analyzed through the courtesy of Dr. H. W. Wiley, Chief Chemist of the Department of Agriculture, were found to contain 20 per cent of tannin.
Wokas, when freshly parched so as to be nicely browned, is a delicious food, particularly if slightly salted and eaten with cream. There is every reason to believe that wokas could be brought into successful use as a breakfast food. Small quantities of it can be purchased from the Indians, but only at a price of from 10 to 20 cents a pound. It is evident that in order to enter into successful competition with other breakfast foods economical machine methods must be devised for extracting the seeds from the pods and putting them through the processes necessary to bring them to the lolensh stage, which is the best form for shipment. The primitive methods at present employed by the Indians are altogether too expensive. Some of the various means now used by seedsmen, coffee dealers, and millers for macerating, roasting, milling, and cleaning seeds are undoubtedly applicable, with some modifications, to the production of wokas.
The writer does not consider the cultivation of the wokas. plant on a commercial scale to be feasible. The available supply of the seeds must be limited to the natural product, which in the Klamath country is estimated at about 10,000 acres. Other, but, so far as known, smaller areas of the plant exist on the Northwest Coast. There seems to be no probability that the pods can be harvested by any other

<<<Page: 1285>>>

method than that now practiced by the Indians—hand picking from boats. It should be possible to secure the pods in this way at 10 cents a bushel, a bushel of the pods producing about one-fourth its bulk of seed, and the seeds about one-third their bulk of lolensh. The weight of lolensh to the measured bushel is about 59 pounds. When parched the lolensh expands to nearly three times its original bulk, a sample of the best shnaps weighing about 21 pounds per bushel. The season of harvesting in the Klamath country is about six weeks—from the middle of August to the end of September. For an illustration of a wokas camp at the close of the season see Plate 13.
