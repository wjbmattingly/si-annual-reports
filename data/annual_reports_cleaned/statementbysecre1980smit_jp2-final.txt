FRONTISPIECE: Details from portraits of George and Martha Washington, painted from life by Gilbert Stuart in 1796. These famous paintings are now, by legal agreement, owned jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, to be shared for exhibition on a three-year rotation. The portraits are presently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.

The Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

portraits with Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts; each of us having raised approximately half the money for the Boston Athenaeum’s requirements, we each can exhibit the Washingtons for a threeyear period. Strangely enough, this concept of sharing unique works of art or history is still new, little endorsed by the great art or historical museums. Pride of possession is still too strong in the hearts of curators, acquisitors all. But it was a grand acquisitor himself, the sometime Metropolitan Museum of Art director, Thomas Hoving, whom I recall suggesting such a program, one with which I am heartily in accord. Solomon’s choice, one might say. Nonsense! Sometimes works of unique importance should be shared, if not physically divided. There is too much parsimony in the world of unique objects as it is.
Finally the Smithsonian is delighted to have the Washingtons back near home, by an agreement reached when all the shouting and exhortations died away from the bunting-draped platforms whence they apparently emanated. The nation can only be the better for this exposure to great works, and benefit from the su__Perior evidence which President and Mrs. Washington provide.
A community of interest should be ours in the sharing as well as the acquiring and exhibiting of works of art. It is to be hoped in the future that more museums will feel this way. Exhibits are for everyone and we have been fortunate to share the Washingtons, as we are fortunate to share exhibitions. Our success here is with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, the prime outreach service in the field of art and history exhibitions that the Institution can offer. This is a far more effective service for us to manage than the oft-repeated plea that we should manage entire museums in other states. We feel it is much more effective to mount exhibitions, with all the talent we can muster, and then launch them in company with colleagues across the land. The act creates mutuality of interest, is similarly educational for everyone including a vast and growing public, and accentuates part of our mandate for “increase and diffusion.” The future is with us in the development of the traveling exhibitions.
The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (sités), founded in 1952, is now the largest and most diversified agency of its kind in the world. Up to one hundred and twenty different exhibitions have been circulated in one year in the United States and

correlate a seminar at Princeton University with an exhibition at the National Museum of History and Technology. Exhibitions also include new acquisitions. The Smithsonian has been fortunate this past year in acquiring gifts in the field of modern art, notably the extremely important collection (part purchase with Regents Collections Acquisition funds, part gift from Vincent Melzac) of contemporary or recent painters including the Washington School, as well as seminal works by William de Kooning, Kenneth Noland, and Jules Olitsky. |
In discussions of museum operations, a distinction is often made between research and exhibition—a distinction that is also enshrined in the language of federal budgets. Although in some ways it may be useful to make this distinction, the fact is that any good exhibition is necessarily both the product of research and a contribution to knowledge. In the case of art and science museums, where the evidence can be fully understood and appreciated only when it is physically before the viewer, exhibitions are in a real sense the most appropriate means of publishing the results of research. In a university, such museum exhibitions should qualify equally with books insofar as they may represent new discoveries of demonstrable theories of the professor-curator. This was a fact I was at pains to point out to faculty administrators during my work at Yale University, for too often such evidence of scholarly research tended to be overlooked. In art museums there is at least an exhibition catalogue published and distributed as tangible printed evidence of scholarly production. Curators among the scientific disciplines usually have less recourse to publications, however, and have sometimes been penalized through lack of comprehension by administrators of the original scholarship and character of exhibitions.
In recent years the art and history museums of the Smithsonian family have increasingly drawn upon their excellent scholarly staffs to create a growing number of exhibitions that have in this sense constituted important contributions to knowledge. While our museums have continued to show exhibitions organized elsewhere, and have added to the pleasure and education of our millions of visitors by doing so, we are particularly pleased to have been able to share with other museums more and more exhibitions conceived and organized within the Smithsonian.

Raphael Soyer, the dean of American realists, came to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden for his 80th birthday exhibition that opened at the museum on December 4, 1979. Here Soyer poses in front of his painting Portraits at a Party, a recent gift to the collection from Joseph H. Hirshhorn. The museum owns more of this artist’s works—62 paintings and drawings—than any other institution.

<<<Page: 15>>>

hibitions of this’ sort indicates something of the range of our museums’ contributions to this common enterprise of scholars and curators everywhere.
The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s important retrospective Miro: Selected Paintings was later seen at the Al| bright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo; Hirshhorn exhibitions of works by Botero and Edwin Dickinson traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas, and Louisville, Kentucky, respectively. An exhibition of oil sketches by Frederic Church from the collection of the CooperHewitt Museum was organized by an outside curator, traveled to eight cities under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service, and was finally shown at the CooperHewitt this year. The National Portrait Gallery’s exhibition Time of Our Lives, consisting of selections from its collection of Time magazine cover portraits, was shown at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin. Three important exhibitions organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts were shared widely with museums elsewhere in this country and abroad: Hugo Robus (1885-1964) was seen at the Allentown Art Museum in Pennsylvania and the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio; Drawings of Morris Louis traveled to the Fogg Art Museum, the Israel Museum, and the Tel Aviv Museum; Across the Nation: Fine Art in Federal Buildings, 1972-79, an exhibition of ninety-seven drawings and maquettes from the artist-in-architecture program of the General Services Administration will travel to the Hunter Museum of Art in Chattanooga and to four other cities. The Renwick Gallery’s beautiful exhibition The Harmonious Craft: American Musical Instruments was shared with the American Craft Museum in New York City, the Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and Northwest Missouri State University. Finally, as the result of a very happy and fruitful international collaboration between Dr. Otto Mayr of our National Museum of History and Technology and the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, the very important exhibition The Clockwork Universe: German Clocks and Automata 1550-1650 will be seen in both institutions. These are examples of the ways in which the museums of the Smithsonian have been able to use their own scholarly resources, and in many cases their own collections, for the benefit of scholars and museum visitors throughout the country and the world. We expect that this sharing will continue and increase in the years ahead.

<<<Page: 16>>>

In all these exhibitions, the Collections Acquisition funds provided by the Smithsonian Regents continue to play a significant role. As part of our trust funds budget allocated for the purpose, these sums, now only three years old, enable our museums to make important additions to collections. Thus the Hirshhorn Museum, in connection with the Miro retrospective exhibition, was able to acquire the painting Woman before an Eclipse with Her Hair Disheveled by the Wind, which was included in the show. Additional examples of such acquisitions are the collection of twelve Chinese calligraphy scrolls, exhibited so handsomely at the Freer Gallery of Art; the Gaston Lachaise sculpture Standing Woman (Heroic Woman) installed on the Hirshhorn Plaza; and those incomparable Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Washington, centerpieces now of the National Portrait Gallery’s holdings.
The possession of such funds is a new development for the Institution, and makes possible, often with matching grants, the purchase of material formerly beyond the Smithsonian’s reach. Similarly the importance of some of our collections, in fields like gems and gemstones, increasingly attracts major gifts.
This has been a significant year in terms of the outstanding research accomplishments with new facilities. For instance, latest reports indicate that the capabilities of the Multiple Mirror Telescope are exceeding our expectations. The site at the summit of Mt. Hopkins is turning out to be excellent for observation purposes and may be one of the very best such locations in the continental United States. The building is also exceeding our hopes in effectiveness. Modifications which we plan over the next few years should result in even sharper stellar images than are being obtained now (one-half arc second). Increasing the sharpness of the image is equivalent to increasing the diameter of the telescope by the same factor. Thus, these improvements are making available to American astronomers a telescope considerably more powerful than the 176inch equivalent that had been anticipated originally.
At the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute an important new facility at the Naos Marine Laboratory was opened by the president of Panama in July 1980. In this completely new aquatic system providing sea water for studies of captive marine organisms, salt water can be provided in raw, filtered, and sediment-free states, and the return flow can be sterilized so that organisms from
baad

non-Pacific sources can be studied without risks of contamination. This facility will greatly enhance the research potential of our marine laboratory and should provide an important adjunct to any future sea-level canal studies, long a concern of the Smithsonian.
Our Marine Sciences Laboratory, located in the National Museum of Natural History / Museum of Man, has acquired its own research vessel and airplane, and this year the laboratory successfully conducted its first combined “sea and air” mission. The trip to the Caribbean focused on the study of coral reefs off the coasts of Haiti and the Virgin Islands. With the success of this expedition, plans are moving forward for the study of Pacific reefs using the same combination of ship and plane. Meanwhile the simulated living coral reef and lagoon with over two hundred species of animals and plants, materials garnered from these Caribbean studies, is now in place in a working laboratory exhibition in our National Museum of Natural History. This exhibition, designed by Dr. Walter Adey and planned with major support from the National Science Foundation, bids fair to becoming a major public education exhibition to be reproduced—with National Science Foundation help—in other museums across the country.
After over ten years of planning, countless meetings and studies, and numerous presentations to the Congress, one of the Institution’s highest priorities is soon to be accomplished. Ground will be broken for the new Museum Support Center which will permit, at long last, the removal of vast portions of the collections of the National Museum of Natural History from inadequate facilities to a milieu where they can be properly conserved, easily retrieved and studied, and contained within laboratories equipped with the most up-to-date technology. Thus, a significant new door is about to open; while in the decades ahead the facility will no doubt have to be expanded, in the near term it can only be described as a quantum improvement.
It is irresponsible as well as unethical for museums to harvest collections only to let them gradually decay in ill-ventilated, overheated, and crowded storage areas. The proper housing of the collections of the National Museum of Natural History is a priority not only of the Institution but of the nation, for these collections in major part are unduplicated and are totally irreplaceable. In their aggregate, they represent a significant portion of the nation’s,

of Washington (1966). Evidence is an aggregate of things, signs and symbols, past and present. It is not merely an exhibit, but the mood that it creates. In the artist’s eye vision induces perspicuity, a seeing through. So it is with objects, objects collected by museums, objects from an attic or a bureau drawer. When my father died I opened the drawer, and there spread before me was the materia vitae, like a Harnett still life, the spectacles, a silver pencil for a waistcoat chain, collar buttons, a photo of a boy in the uniform of the Knickerbocker Grays, an old letter, and a diary.
If we did not build the Museum Support facility, where would our conscience be? If we did not collect objects, what evidence of truth would there be? Objects are a surer evidence than legal precedents, whose evidence Henry Clay questioned in one of his speeches in the Senate in 1835: “a solitary precedent . . . which has never been re-examined can not be conclusive.” It is not so with objects, be they the jawbone of Balaam’s ass, or the golden cup of Alexander of Macedon. Now that people read less, perhaps objects will return to their former status as evidence of truth, old testaments to revelation. Sometimes I have described museums, a bit facetiously, as the only legitimate growth industry (in a world of declining natural resources). It is true that in our present mode of life, in spite of the successes of the auction business, more and more people live under increasingly compressed physical conditions. Rooms are smaller, ceilings lower, attics like the trunk spaces of automobiles soon to be nonexistent. So, more and more, museums are being called upon as a last resort to winnow the chaff of possessions—and authentically curate the results. Museums live as they grow, presiding over the verities of history. I once quoted a Dr. Scott cited by the famous writer and philosopher, Cardinal Newman, as saying that “growth is the only evidence of life,” a statement with a convincing biological ring. If one assumes this to be true, then museums and their careful curating have a far higher priority in life than public recognition or support gives them credit for.
In Washington today there exists a great paradox: life goes on but not much growth. One must eat and sleep and mind one’s daily affairs, but the mood is numb. Too few people look at the dome of the Capitol or notice the soaring thrust of the Washington Monument, to sense the meaning and feel the past through mists,

through eighth, and the Fourth of July festivities celebrated, in the words of John Adams, with “shews, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations.”” Other celebrations included the twentieth anniversary of the civil rights movement marked by a working conference and an exhibition as well as songs and music of the time. The production of records, music, and dance were on our agenda this past year, as well as a colloquium titled The Muses Flee Hitler, and a special ceremony participated in by other institutions and museums across the country and graced by the presence of the regal and dedicated King and Queen of the Belgians, Their Majesties, King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola.
So the Institution flourishes with exhibits, sound, publications, and distinguished collaborators and visitors of every ilk, the most varied, delightful, and—to paraphrase P. T. Barnum—biggest and best show on earth!

_ Board of Regents
THE BOARD OF REGENTS held three formal meetings during the last year as well as a number of additional meetings of the Executive Committee, the Investment Policy Committee, the Personnel Committee, and the Audit and Review Committee.
The board’s first meeting of the year, on January 28, 1980, opened in the Regents’ Room with a tribute to the late Regent John Nicholas Brown, who died October 9, 1979. A memorial was prepared in fine calligraphy for presentation to Mrs. Brown. To fill the vacancies on the board occasioned by Mr. Brown’s untimely death and the resignation of Regent Thomas J. Watson, Jr., to become Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Regents entertained the recommendations of their search committee and voted to nominate William G. Bowen and Carlisle H. Humelsine for statutory terms of six years each. These appointments were confirmed by joint resolutions of the Congress and signed into law by the president on March 13, 1980.
The Regents’ Personnel Committee reported that no conflicts of interest were apparent in the confidential financial interests statements of the senior staff of the Institution. In addition, the Audit and Review Committee reported on its first meeting of the year which had consisted of an overview of the Smithsonian’s organization, programs, funding, and staffing; a description of the independent auditing of trust funds, conducted this year by Coopers and Lybrand; and an outline of the work of the Institution’s internal auditor.
The Treasurer provided an analysis of fiscal year 1979 results in the Institution’s trust funds and reported the receipt of fiscal year 1980 federal appropriations. The financial reports included details on the allowance of the Office of Management and Budget and on the new programs highlighted in the fiscal year 1981 consolidated budget being submitted to Congress. In keeping with their bylaws, the Regents delegated certain authorities to the Secretary for the acceptance and transfer of specific kinds of gifts, grants, and beguests. The Investment Policy Committee reported that the Insti-

<<<Page: 24>>>

tution’s investment managers had outperformed market averages over fifteen months prior to September 30, 1979. The Regents approved the Five-Year Prospectus (fiscal years 1981-1985) which had been updated to reflect the Regents’ decisions on the fiscal year 1980 nonappropriated funds budget, allocation of the fiscal year 1980 federal budget, and fiscal year 1981 federal budget allowances from the Office of Management and Budget. New exhibition programs, equipment costs for the Museum Support Center, and planning funds for the Quadrangle project were highlighted.
The Secretary reported that the architectural/engineering firm of Shepley Bulfinch Richardson and Abbott had been selected to continue detailed planning to supplement Junzo Yoshimura’s original concepts of the Quadrangle development. Mr. Ripley outlined planning expected to be accomplished with trust funds this year and summarized fund-raising efforts underway.
The Regents appointed five additional members to the Museum of African Art Commission: Messrs. Richard Long, Beverly Carter, Roy Sieber, Walter E. Washington, and Mrs. Katherine White. The Regents also approved the actions of the commissions of the National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery and appointed the Honorable Robert B. Morgan and Mr. Thomas Mellon Evans to the latter commission. The Secretary was authorized to renew negotiations with the Boston Athenaeum for the purchase of the Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Washington. Subsequent to the meeting the chairman of the Executive Committee approved an agreement by which the Smithsonian would pay $2,750,000, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, would pay $2,125,000, and the Boston Athenaeum would lower the purchase price to $4,875,000; the Smithsonian and the Museum of Fine Arts would be equal partners in ownership and would exhibit the portraits for equal time, alternating every three years; and the Smithsonian, after consultation, would have final authority and responsibility for conservation.
The Regents voted to present the Henry Medal to Gordon N. Ray for his distinguished leadership of the Smithsonian Council since 1970. The medal was presented on behalf of the Regents by the Secretary at the Regents’ Dinner May 4, 1980, where Dr. Ray spoke briefly about the history and significance of the council since its founding.

The Secretary presented a report of the work in popular book _ publishing accomplished by Smithsonian Exposition Books and the _ Regents approved the publication of Every Four Years ... The _ American Presidency. The Secretary also discussed the status of the Museum Support Center, the Mall Parking Study, and the Equal Opportunity Program, which subject, together with the future of the Belmont Conference Center property, was referred to the Audit and Review Committee for examination. Additional reports were received on the impact of the Panama Canal Treaty implementing legislation on the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Civil Service reform; major construction projects; the status of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange; litigation; legislation; the return of museum objects to the Hillwood Museum; the appointment of Dr. Fiske as Director of the National Museum of Natural History / Museum of Man; the Smithsonian delegation’s trip to China. The Regents were also provided an updated report, “Survey of Smithsonian Institution Property.”
At the second meeting of the Board of Regents, held in the Regents’ Room on May 5, 1980, the Executive Committee reported on its meeting of April 2 and made recommendations to the Regents on the agenda papers. Three Regents’ terms were scheduled to expire on August 30, 1980, and it was learned that Dr. GellMann and Mr. Burden would be reappointed (the joint resolutions of the Congress were subsequently signed into law by the president on July 25, 1980) while Dr. Haskins would not seek reappointment. The Chancellor asked the Executive Committee to serve as the search committee to seek a replacement, and the Regents elected Mr. Humelsine to serve on the Executive Committee succeeding Dr. Haskins effective September 1, 1980.
The Audit and Review Committee reported on its meetings of February 28 and May 3, 1980. The Committee’s agenda included a discussion with Coopers and Lybrand on their independent audit of trust funds for fiscal year 1979, and reviews of the Institution’s inventory of collections, the process of budgeting unrestricted trust funds, the status of the Belmont Conference Center, and the Smithsonian’s equal opportunity program. On the recommendation of the committee, it was voted “that the Board of Regents lends its full support to the Institution’s intensified efforts and encourages and directs the management of the Institution to take all

activities; future parking revenues; proceeds from the sale of Museum of African Art real estate; contributions through fundraising efforts; and federal appropriations.
The Secretary presented reports on the Museum Support Center, including the status of design, hearings, and the conclusion—after considerable study—to seek appropriations for an innovative threetiered, self-supporting storage system. Progress was noted in the inventories of collections in the National Museum of Natural History / National Museum of Man and the National Museum of History and Technology.
The board accepted the annual report for fiscal year 1979, reappointed Mr. Andrew Oliver to the Commission of the National Portrait Gallery, and endorsed the Executive Committee’s and the Secretary’s recommendation to the president that General Andrew J. Goodpaster and Professor Theodore Ropp be appointed to the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board (which appointments were made by President Carter on June 6, 1980). The Regents voted to award the Hodgkins Medal and Prize to Dr. Luigi Jacchia, physicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, “in recognition of his pioneering work in atmospheric physics which has led to an understanding of the earth’s upper atmosphere and its bearing on the welfare of man.”
The Regents received reports on the special Collections Acquisition Program begun by the Regents with nonappropriated trust funds in January 1978. Attention was drawn to the acquisitions under this program, the funds generated by provisions for matching funds, and the condition of the present acquisition funds. Additional status reports were prepared on popular book publishing, the Mall parking study, construction projects, litigation, legislation, and the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange.
At the Regents’ Dinner, held Sunday evening, May 4, in the courtyard of the Fine Arts and Portrait Gallery Building, the Regents were treated to a glimpse of the newly arrived Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Washington. On behalf of the Regents, the Chancellor presented to Mrs. Ripley a necklace with a pendant of polished smithsonite mounted on a Smithsonian sunburst medallion, and a citation which read in part: “The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution note with admiration the many contributions with which Mary Livingston Ripley has advanced the

The Secretary submitted a report on the status of the Museum Support Center on which construction is expected to begin in early 1981. The Secretary also reported on changes anticipated in the popular book publishing program following a thorough review by a special panel of Smithsonian Council members, outside publishers, and Smithsonian staff. A new policy on the use of Smithsonian facilities (Office Memorandum 724) was brought to the Regents’ attention, as was a report on Smithsonian arrangements for conducting research in foreign nations. The Secretary highlighted the planned implementation of noncapital intensive recommendations from the completed study for visitors’ access to the Mall museums. The Regents also received for comment a draft of the revised Five-year Prospectus for fiscal years 1982-86. Other reports furnished in advance concerned major construction projects, the equal employment opportunity program, legislation, litigation, the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board.
The Regents’ Dinner was held at the Supreme Court on Sunday evening, September 21, 1980, at the invitation of the Chancellor and Mrs. Burger. The dinner was in honor of Dr. Haskins, who was presented the Henry Medal by the Chancellor. The Secretary presented the Hodgkins Medal and Prize to Dr. Jacchia of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

Smithsonian Institution 1980 FINANCIAL REPORT
Summary: During fiscal year 1980 the Smithsonian received strong financial support from the Congress, from donors, from granting agencies, and from revenue-generating auxiliary activities. This mix of funding from public and private sources, from gifts and earned income, permitted notable progress and accomplishments in research, exhibits, publications, and public education. Growth in the overall budget of the Institution in fiscal year 1980 and prior years may be seen in the bar chart on the facing page which displays the source and application by broad category of operating funds. In the context of unusually high inflation, however, this growth was mainly illusory; the larger part of the increased budget was necessarily devoted to keeping up with the higher costs of salaries and supplies, of utilities and collection purchases, with the balance limited to selected high-priority concerns of the Institution. The full-time staff of the Smithsonian grew less than 3 percent over the year, and the increase was almost exclusively in personnel for administrative and facilities services, for auxiliary activities, and for short-term research projects.
In a time of difficulty for most cultural and research organizations, the continued generous support of the Congress was greatly appreciated. The overall federal appropriations, which totaled over $144 million, provided core support for basic research, exhibition, and education programs; for acquisition, care, documentation, and study of the national collections; and for construction, maintenance, restoration, and protection of Smithsonian facilities. Beyond offsetting the major portion of uncontrollable cost increases, appropriations for operating purposes gave significant new funding for the Museum of African Art, for collections inventory

Operating Funds —Sources and Application
The growth in past years of the Institution’s overall operating budget has continued in fiscal year 1980, as may be seen in both Table 1 and the bar chart at the head of this section. Total gross operating funds grew from $184,945,000 in fiscal year 1979, to $205,025,000 in fiscal year 1980, an increase of $20,080,000, or 11 percent. Federal appropriations constitute 53 percent of total gross operating funds provided, federal agency grants and contracts 6 percent, and nonappropriated funds 41 percent, the same ratios as last year.
After deducting the expenses of the nonappropriated fund auxiliary and bureau activities, the growth in net operating funds was 9 percent over fiscal year 1979. This increase in net funds of $11,704,000 was primarily in federal appropriations ($9,562,000) and federal agency grants and contracts ($1,535,000). Net operating funds, supporting the wide range of Smithsonian programs and activities, are derived 78 percent from federal appropriations, 9 percent from federal agency grants and contracts, and 13 percent from nonappropriated sources. Application of these moneys by all Smithsonian bureaux is set forth in Table 2, with further supporting detail in other tables.
Federal funds totaling $107,764,000, an increase of approximately $9.6 million over fiscal year 1979, were provided to the Institution for operating purposes. As in the past several years, a major portion of this increase was directed to generally uncontrollable items. Inflation in the areas of salaries and utilities accounted for some $6.9 million of the increase, while an additional $500,000 was required to fund the first full year of operating costs for the Museum of African Art. The balance of $2.2 million was applied to a variety of program requirements. Collections management, a high priority

<<<Page: 33>>>

of the Institution, received additional funding of over $1 million to support collections inventory, storage, and conservation in bureaux throughout the Institution, furthering efforts to gain more effective inventory control over the collections and to conserve the valuable objects and specimens. A second area of emphasis was the strengthening of administrative capabilities, particularly in the areas of facilities planning and personnel management. In the first instance the growth reflected increased focus by the Institution on maintaining and preserving its physical plant, while in the latter, the growth was needed to meet new requirements created by both the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Panama Canal Treaty. Implementation of this treaty also necessitated major new funding for the Tropical Research Institute for personnel benefits and security needs. Finally, increased support was provided for exhibit protection and various other priorities of the Institution. For seven months of fiscal year 1980 the Institution was subject to a hiring limitation imposed by the president of the United States; resultant savings in personnel costs and cuts in other expenses were applied towards a $550,000 deficit in utilities funding created by price increases that were beyond the Institution’s control.
A major source of support, particularly for the Institution’s research activities, is federal agency grants and contracts (including subcontracts from organizations receiving federal prime funding). The funding agencies for the awards, which in fiscal year 1980 accounted for 9 percent of net operating revenue, or approximately $13 million, are summarized in Table 3. As may be seen from this table, the majority of these funds was from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NAsA), primarily for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sao) which, as in past years, received substantially more grant support than other Smithsonian bureaux. NASA grants supported important space science projects in high-energy astrophysics and radio/geoastronomy, including preparation of instruments for the Space Shuttle program. sao also received significant funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense, as did the National Museum of Natural History for operations of the Oceanographic Sorting Center and for continuation of the Medical Entomology Project.

The Institution received a wide range of funding from nonfederal sources for a variety of purposes. These nonappropriated trust fund revenues totaled $84,314,000 in the aggregate in fiscal year 1980, an increase of almost $9 million, or 12 percent over fiscal year 1979. After excluding the auxiliary and bureau activity costs which are necessary to generate a portion of these revenues, the net income available for program purposes was $18,381,000, a modest increase of 3 percent of net operating funds which, as may be seen in Tables 2, 4, and 5, supported programs throughout the Institution.
Restricted funds may be used only for the purposes specified by the donor or funding source. Total restricted fund revenues for the year were $5,339,000, consisting of $2,257,000 from gifts and

grants, $2,349,000 from investment income, and $733,000 from other sources including fundraising events of the Archives of American Art and the museum shop of the Freer Gallery of Art. Endowment income, as outlined more fully below, provides major operating support for the Freer and for oceanographic research conducted at the Fort Pierce Bureau, as well as for a wide range of other research and educational projects throughout the Institution. Major gifts were received during the year for exhibitions of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the National Museum of History and Technology, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service; for collections acquisition at the National Museum of Natural History and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; for documentation of the Catalogue of American Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery; and for a long-term watershed monitoring project at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies. A transfer of $650,000 of funds available for the general support of the National Air and Space Museum was made to endowment funds, in order to ensure permanent funding of the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History.
Unrestricted Special Purpose funds consist of revenues generated by bureau activities, such as the National Air and Space Museum film theater and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum membership program; interest earned on investment of bureau fund balances; revenuesharing with bureaux housing centrally managed shop and concession activities; and allocations of funds for the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach programs ($2 million per year), fellowship awards ($822,000) and a number of other designated purposes. The Collections Acquisition Program this year permitted a joint purchase by the National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, of the pair of Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha Washington; exhibit of these paintings will alternate between the two museums for three-year periods.
Unrestricted General Purpose funds are moneys, primarily generated from auxiliary activities, that are available for general purposes of the Institution. Net general unrestricted funds, after expenses of auxiliary activities, totaled $11,605,000 (see Table 6), approximately the same level as in fiscal year 1979. Financial activity of the auxiliary activities that accounted for most of this

generated largely by the Smithsonian magazine which has maintained its large number of enthusiastic readers. Also contributing sizable surpluses for other needs of the Institution were the Museum Shop and Mail Order divisions, owing to unexpectedly strong sales from three mail order catalogues, and the concessions/ parking revenues, which benefitted from the popularity of the Institution’s museums. Publications of both the Smithsonian Institution Press and Smithsonian Exposition Books sold well during the year, largely through mail order, and the combined surplus of these programs exceeded $550,000. The unusually high level of interest rates during fiscal year 1980 as well as prior year additions to endowment funds resulted in investment income of $2,470,000 last year, some $200,000 higher than the prior year.
These funds enabled the Institution to continue programmatic and administrative support to a large number of bureaux, partic-

ularly the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Office of Folklife Programs, the Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Center, and the Office of Telecommunications. Transfers to Special Purpose funds were made to continue the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach programs ($2 million), Fluid Research awards which meet small equipment, travel, and research needs of Smithsonian professional staff ($200,000), and the Smithsonian Fellowship Program, at an increased level of stipend support to preand postdoctoral fellows ($822,000).
As in past years, an addition of some $2 million to the Institution’s Unrestricted Endowment Funds was made at year-end, in order to ensure continuation in the future of projects supported from current revenues. As described below, transfers were also made to support construction projects, primarily the Quadrangle and the Sensory Garden. The Quadrangle also received $40,000 this year from contributions of the Smithson Society of the Associates, which is expected to provide further support to the project in the future.
Other Operating Programs
A separate appropriation of $4.2 million was received for the Smithsonian Special Foreign Currency Program in blocked foreign currencies accumulated from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 83-480. Of this amount, $3.7 million (the same amount as in fiscal year 1979) was to continue a program of research grants to United States institutions in Egypt, India, Pakistan, and Burma in the disciplines of archaeology, systematic and environmental biology, astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum programs. The remaining $500,000 was to establish a reserve of Indian rupees to ensure continued program support of the American Institute of Indian Studies after the supply of “excess” rupees is depleted. Obligation of these funds is shown in Table 8 by country and research discipline.
In fiscal year 1980 funds for support of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange were appropriated to the Department of Commerce, rather than the Smithsonian as in prior years, and are therefore not reflected in this report.

A total of $1,342,000 in nonappropriated funds was transferred to facilities development and land acquisition in fiscal year 1980, and a further $1,155,000 of gifts and other income was received for construction projects. A gift of $1 million for the Quadrangle was received in March 1980 from the government of Japan in fulfillment of its earlier pledge toward this facility. In addition, the Institution set aside a further $1 million of unrestricted trust funds for the Quadrangle, of which $500,000 was designated for use in fiscal year 1980 to continue planning and engineering

Additional funds were transferred for development of a Sensory Garden to be located in the area to the east of the Arts and Industries Building and for minor payments related to land acquisition at the Chesapeake Bay Center and the Museum of African Art.

in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund, $1 million is on permanent deposit in the United States Treasury, and the remaining $60,000 is held in miscellaneous securities. The majority of the Institution’s endowment funds ($49,107,000, or 63 percent) is restricted, with income available for use only as specified by the original donor; the remaining $29,283,000, or 37 percent, is unrestricted and supports general programs of the Institution. A portion of these latter funds, however, has been designated by the Institution for specific purposes, such as the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History Endowment, which will enable term appointments of leading scholars at the National Air and Space Museum. The unrestricted endowments have grown in recent years owing largely to transfers of moneys from current funds, as approved by the Board of Regents; $2,660,000 was so transferred in fiscal year 1980, and $2,650,000 in fiscal year 1979. During the year, a ‘thorough review of all endowment funds was conducted to ensure proper classification and documentation of their sources and restrictions, resulting in the reclassification of several funds. A full listing of all endowment funds may be seen in Table 13.
The Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund is invested under the management of outside professional advisory firms under close supervision of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer, subject to policy guidelines approved by the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents. As of the end of this year these firms, with the portion of the Fund under their management, were Batterymarch Financial Management (30 percent), Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (53 percent), and Torray Clark & Company (17 percent). During fiscal year 1980, the total rate of return (market appreciation as well as interest and dividend yield) of the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund, as calculated by an independent investment measurement service, was +18.8 percent, as compared to +12.9 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and +-21.2 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Average, both calculated on the same basis. Of the $11,774,000 increase in market value of the Fund during the year, $7,829,000 was due to market appreciation, $2,846,000 to gifts and transfers, and $1,099,000 to dividend and interest yield reinvested in principal (see Table 12).

and capital appreciation) is available for expenditure each year as income, and the remainder is retained as principal. This total return income payout is determined each year based on a review of anticipated dividend and interest yields, support needs of the Institution’s bureaux, inflationary factors, and the five-year running average of market values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital. The amount of such income paid in fiscal year 1980 to endowments in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund represented an increase of 5.5 percent over the fiscal year 1979 rate of income, and a further increase of 10 percent has been approved for fiscal year 1981. Even after this payout, $1,099,000 of excess interest and dividend yield was available for reinvestment into principal.

Related Organizations
The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc. (sste) is devoted to facilitating the planning, management, and coordination of the nation’s research through the collection, processing, and dissemination of information about ongoing research. Incorporated by the Smithsonian in 1971 as a separate nonprofit entity, ssIE was funded in past years through an annual contract from the Smithsonian, equal to the appropriation provided the Smithsonian for this purpose. As noted in last year’s report, the fiscal 1980 appropriation for ssIE was made to the Department of Commerce in anticipation of the integration of the functions of ssre into the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Pending consolidation of these activities and termination of the corporation, the Smithsonian has continued to provide ss1E with administrative and fiscal services on a contract basis.
Reading is Fundamental, Inc. (RIF), associated with the Institution since 1968, is an independent, separately incorporated entity dedicated to the improvement of reading abilities in children. Primary support is derived from private contributions and a federal contract with the Department of Education to operate the federal Inexpensive Book Distribution Program. Administrative services are provided by the Institution on a contract basis.
The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the National Gallery of Art, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts were established by Congress within the Institution but are administered by separate boards of trustees. Independent financial reports are prepared by each of these organizations. Office space and fiscal and other administrative and support services are provided the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on a reimbursement basis.
The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) is an independent, nonprofit corporation working closely with the National Zoological

<<<Page: 50>>>

Park. It operates under contract a number of beneficial concessions for the National Zoo. Fonz provided concession and rental fees to the Zoo amounting to more than $147,000 during calendar year 1979 (FoNz’s fiscal year). In addition, Fonz contributed other important financial and volunteer support for Zoo programs. Financial affairs of this organization are disclosed separately elsewhere in Smithsonian Year 1980.
Accounting and Auditing
The nonappropriated trust funds of the Institution are audited annually by an independent public accounting firm; the report of Coopers & Lybrand is contained in the following pages. Additional reviews are conducted annually on a number of Smithsonian activities by the internal audit staff. Additionally, the Defense Contract Audit Agency conducts an annual audit of grants and contracts received from federal agencies, as well as general and administrative costs.
The Audit and Review Committee of the Regents held several meetings during the year pursuant to their responsibility, under the bylaws of the Institution, for reviewing the Smithsonian’s accounting systems and internal financial controls; for facilitating communication between the Board of Regents and auditors from the internal audit staff, the independent accounting firm, and the General Accounting Office; and for reviewing operations of the Institution for compliance with approved programs and policies.

Distinctive museum shop displays have won design awards and keep business at a brisk pace year round. Carrying out the theme of the Centennial in the Arts and Industries Building, the Smith & Sun Photographic Gallery in the 1876 Museum Shop
produces authentic tintypes and supplies period costumes. Below. The Craft Shop in the National Museum of History and Technology features handmade crafts from across the United States. Articles on sale are similar to those on display in the museum, this being the marketing rationale.

To the Board of Regents Smithsonian Institution
We have examined the balance sheet of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1980 and the related statement of financial activity for the year then ended. Our examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We previously examined and reported upon the statements of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution for the year ended September 30, 1979, totals of which are included in the accompanying financial statements for comparative purposes only.
The statements of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, or other departments, bureaus and programs administered by the Smithsonian Institution under federal appropriations as detailed in Note 2 to the financial statements. |
In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1980, referred to above, present fairly the financial position of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1980, and the results of operations and changes in fund balances for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION—TRUST FUNDS Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation. The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution— Trust Funds (Institution) have been prepared on the accrual basis.
Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into funds established according to their nature and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
The assets, liabilities and fund balances of the Institution are reported in selfbalancing fund groups as follows:
Current funds, which include unrestricted and restricted resources, represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Separate subfund groups of current unrestricted funds have been reflected in the financial statements for auxiliary activities (representing primarily the revenue and expenditures of the Smithsonian Associates Program, including the Smithsonian Magazine, and museum shop sales) and for special purposes (representing internally segregated funds for certain designated purposes). Amounts restricted by the donor for specific purposes are also segregated from other current funds.
Endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment and similar funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds. Quasiendowment funds are funds established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
Plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisitions and funds expended for plant.
All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other disposition of investments are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar manner, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds.

<<<Page: 57>>>

Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of average cost, computed on a first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value.
Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription, which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian Magazine are charged to income over the period of the subscription.
The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.
Works of art, living or other specimens. In accordance with the practice generally followed by museums, works of art and living or other specimens are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
Property and equipment. Capitalized improvements and equipment purchased with Trust Funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized in the current unrestricted fund at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. In accordance with the practice of many museums, depreciation on buildings is not recorded.
All other land, buildings, fixtures and equipment which were principally acquired with federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
Government contracts. The Institution has a number of contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract revenue is recognized when billable or received.
Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these statements since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.
2. Related activities
The Trust Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, from federal grants and contracts, and from certain business activities related to the operations of the Institution.
Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements, provide major support for the operations and administration of the educational and research programs of the Institution’s many museums, art galleries and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and construction of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings and other assets acquired with federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
The following federal appropriations were received by the Institution for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1980 and 1979:

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several separately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution facilities occupied, etc., totaled approximately $370,000 for the year ended September 30, 1980. The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1980 and 1979, respectively, as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

Pending completion of this transfer, the Institution will continue to provide fiscal and administrative services.
3. Investments
Investments are recorded at cost, if purchased, or at fair market value at date of acquisition, if acquired by gift. At September 30, 1980, investments are composed of the following:

Substantially all of the investments of the endowment and similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $136.08, 350,359 units were owned by endowment and 217,896 units were owned by quasi endowment at September 30, 1980.
The following tabulation summarizes changes in relationships between cost and market values of the pooled investments:

<<<Page: 60>>>

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from the current funds.
In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such factors as, but not limited to: (1) 442% of the five-year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2) current dividend and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists, and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received. The total return factor for 1980 was $5.00 per unit of fund participation. The total return applied for 1980 was $2,745,992.
6. Property and equipment
Property and equipment is comprised of the following:

Depreciation and amortization expense reflected in expenditures of the current funds for 1980 and 1979 was $326,997 and $221,202, respectively.
The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1980 includes $3,810,063 of unexpended plant funds.
7. Pension plan
The Institution has a retirement plan in which substantially all Trust Funds’ employees are eligible to participate. Under the plan, both the Institution and the employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1980 was $2,072,520. It is the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently.

8. Income taxes
The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that section are taxable only on their unrelated business income. The Internal Revenue Service is presently considering a request for technical advice pertaining to whether income derived from several of the Institution’s activities is subject to tax as unrelated business income. If the Institution’s position is upheld, no tax would be imposed on this income.
It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income taxation. The Institution has not yet sought such dual status.
Management believes that any income taxes required as a result of settlement of these matters would not have a material effect upon the financial position of the Institution.
