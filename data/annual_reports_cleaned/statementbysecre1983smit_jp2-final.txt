The Smithsonian Institution
The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

This recently acquired wooden figure of a woman and child from Kongo (Yombe), Zaire, was featured in the first of a series of exhibitions highlighting objects from the collections of the National Museum of African Art. The 10%4-inch carving of the late nineteenth or early twentieth century is one of six known Yombe figures of that style—and the only one in a public museum collection in the United States.

Relics of the True Cross
THE PROBLEMS OF museum philosophy seem to center around the subject of objects. As I have discussed in the past, it is my conviction as a teacher over the years that there is “truth in objects.” Even after years, museums have a long way to go to establish this essential and undeniable fact. Throughout the past generations, there has been a curious dichotomy in the view held by scholars in the history of art on the one hand, and in biology, geology, and the natural sciences on the other. In the history of art, there is a tendency to read about objects. There will be photographs of objects in publications, of course, taken at face value. It is not always necessary to handle the objects or to have them inspected, felt, touched, or treated in such a way as to involve physical contact.
In the natural sciences, the tendency has been for the research worker to go directly to the object, to handle it, feel it, measure it, deal with it on a strongly tactile basis whether it be animate or inanimate, alive or dead, fossilized or impermeable rock. This dichotomy reaches into a whole realm of thinking about objects, I believe. It is evidenced occasionally in the presentation of objects as between art and the natural sciences. Art objects, especially physical objects such as examples of smaller sculpture in porcelain, stone, wood, or precious metals or gems, tend to be placed in an exhibit case or vitrine, a casket or monstrance on their own, essentially inviolate, as it were, as if it were necessary only to look at them and take heed of their substance from afar. Physical science objects may be exhibited in cases, but there is usually a fairly elaborate explanation of why they are there, ranging from a label describing their characteristics to a diorama in which they are set

<<<Page: 13>>>

against a representation of their own environment. There is much more of an effort to describe and explain objects in the physical sciences than there is with art objects. Art speaks for itself and the tradition has been that this is a closed communion between the viewer and the object without the necessity perhaps of contact or explanation.
Something of the problem of divining truth from objects comes from these differences of approach. If an art object speaks for itself and has an ascription to the person who created it, that may be sufficient. It is then readily understandable that the art object represents a period, a time, or a phase in the thought, development, and history of the particular person who created it. It is not essentially necessary to touch it or to glean more information from it except for conservation purposes, or in the relatively undeveloped field of archaeometry, or for ascription in case it is suspected of being a fake. The latter rarely happens with natural objects, although, of course, conservation and material examinations, including anatomical and specific analyses, may often take place with specimens destined for further authentication. Occasionally a fake is discovered in this process. Although this may occur in the analysis of gems, it can even happen with other assumed natural objects, as I have noted in my own experience. Famous examples in the past have been the attempts to create new types of species out of natural objects such as the Piltdown skull, several kinds of new insects (which were proved to be assemblages of alien parts), and even a similar attempt to create a “humbug” in the form of a type of bird of which I know at least two examples in museum collections.
The plain fact remains, however, that the lack of emphasis or weight on the pure intellectual knowledge of the truth of things from examining objects has never been sufficiently appreciated or understood in the broad perspective of education. Time out of mind, human beings have shown that they have inherent aptitudes and skills for reading objects through tactile methods rather than visual. Whether because they are blind, dyslexic, or because they are artists in different media, certain individuals learn far more from handling objects than just from looking at them or reading about them. If, then, there is an inherited tendency for humans to understand objects not only by the more traditional means of

The Smithsonian’s impressive new Museum Support Center, designed to house and preserve more than six million objects in a stable and controlled environment, was dedicated on May 16, 1983. An aerial photograph of this unique, ultra-modern facility—approximately five acres under one roof—is shown on the preceding pages. On the opposite page is an interior view of the building showing a skylighted “street” area. Deceptively quiet in this photograph, taken soon after construction, the “street” will become a bustling thoroughfare, filled with scholars, conservators, and other workers going about their tasks in the Center, which is designed for all aspects of conservation as well as for storage. (Photographs by Jeffrey Tinsley and Dane Penland)

port Center. Many years in the planning, as all our structures seem to be, this center consists of four enormous pods, each the size of a football field and thirty feet high, with ample devices for security, humidity, air conditioning, heating, and so forth. These four pods are connected by a kind of “galleria” which joins them all and provides adjunct access to study areas, research laboratories, preparation facilities, and above all, a huge conservation training and laboratory area. The hope is obviously that appropriate recognition will be given to the fact that merely having objects is not enough.
Museums are deficient today in the resources and the advance preparation for conservation. The preservation of objects already in the possession of museums is a project almost as stupendous as the rebuilding of the public road system in the United States. The wear and tear on objects, even those maintained in museums, while often imperceptible, is unceasing. Objects are deteriorating as we look at them. The evidence collected in museums, while pathetically small in itself as far as representing the scope and sweep of past history is concerned, declines every day through largely unnoticeable deterioration. Unless an enormous, conscious effort is made to create an understanding of the priority for major conservation in at least a dozen fields, the museums of the future will find themselves veritable sepulchres, the objects preserved with such care as relics of the true cross, fading away into dust, just perhaps as many of the so-called “relics of the true cross” have already vanished from the scene, leaving behind the gilded, bejeweled monstrances or pyxes in which they were encased.
Thus, it would appear that the creation of this Museum Support Center presages a new dimension in the treatment of objects for the future. The more that can be done to encourage such sophisticated museum storage, research, and conservation the better. Our center, built with so much effort and trial and error, should be an example for the future for all museum practice. We are deeply grateful to the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress for having given us the funds to create this pace-setting structure, as well as to those of our staff, such as Frank Taylor, Robert Organ, and Paul Perrot, who have never lost sight of this vast priority. With the necessary space and skills available, we expect a special research task will be at work on the abstruse problems of why

lost a measure of diversity, we may be sealing our own demise, for in this principle of diversity may lie much of the future and the promise for ourselves.
I note in traveling to far places in less-developed countries an essential harmony between people who have always lived on the land, and their surroundings, whether they be in forest or desert or scrub, and who sustain themselves through simple methods of agriculture, by which they thus live in a cooperative state with nature. I note with dismay the vast changes being wreaked upon tropical environments by modern technology. Lumbering and the destruction of forests bring advancing desiccation everywhere. The failure to grasp the principles of soil and water, the balance between agriculture and fallow land, brings on the seemingly inevitable disappearance of the forests themselves (which flourish on poor soils not capable of cultivation) and the resulting problems of erosion, laterization, and diminished rainfall. All of these problems persist in spite of warning and example. Where remedial actions have been taken they seem to exist only in bits and pieces, here and there.
The question of minimal space required for the preservation of species is one which still eludes us, for the complex web of species in nature, especially in the tropics, is still only beginning to be unraveled. What we should be cultivating in the world today is not the development of armies equipped with weapons or technological wizardry, but rather a “green army” of people dedicated to environmental understanding and conservation, before it is too late.
Much of this impetus towards conservation and environmental preservation is inexorably linked to the presence of a variety of cultures. People living in harmony with nature tend to be the same people who are concerned about preserving cultural traditions. That their children should neglect these concepts or overlook their memories could be fatal for the future. How much of all of this still seems unintelligible to administrators and governments! It would be our hope at the Smithsonian that understanding and respect for the cultural heritage of the majority of the world’s peoples today could be a goal to achieve through demonstrations, exhibits, and open education. Such results could perform a service for all humanity. It remains to be seen how long it will be before

<<<Page: 21>>>

governments:can understand that the preservation of varieties of cultures is part of the process of environmental balance. Technology transfer is not enough, unless it marches hand in hand with the preservation of indigenous cultures and the accompanying environmental stability. The alternative is only failure.
Nature as a vast organism is capable of brushing aside many of the by-products of present-day evolved civilization, such as acid rain, mercury content in water, pollution in soils, the effect of pesticides (some of which are quite doted upon by certain insects), and the deterioration of the quality of life which occurs in major urban centers. We are all acquainted with many of the overtones of these aspects of our advanced civilization. It is true, however, that in nature there are still ample means for absorbing and diminishing such effects. The ozone-layer phenomenon appears to be not nearly so significant as thought a few years back, likewise mercury in the water and other scare stories of the time. It is true also that natural phenomena, such as major terrestrial upheavals, volcanoes, earthquakes and their by-products, may well be as significant as much of environmental destruction wreaked by humans. However, we certainly are narrowing the gap. Let us hope only that our new Smithsonian Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures can in its own way help to remind people everywhere of the lesson to be learned that conservation in both the cultural and environmental sense is perhaps the dominant world problem.
Although the main emphasis of the past year has been upon the completion and opening of the Museum Support Center, steady progress has been continuing on the creation of our new Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures, which the Annual Report for 1982 dwelt upon at length. We described there how the Smithsonian was embarking on an expansion on an international scale of our essential motto “for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and I said at that time, “For perhaps the first time in our history, we are .. .

A dazzling performance by the Rainbow Chinese Dancers was among the 160 programs attended by more than 20,000 visitors at the Renwick Gallery in conjunction with Celebration: A World of Art and Ritual, a major exhibition that included over 600 objects from nine Smithsonian museums.
The Office of Museum Programs developed a series of four Museum Career Days to familiarize students with the museum profession. Here, students representing thirteen countries are taken on a behind-the-scenes tour by Edward Lawson, head of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden’s Education Department. More
than seventy-five students fron the D.C. Public Schools’ Multicultural Career Intern Programs took part in these activities.

and other problems of equipping the building, we anticipate remaining within budget, a goal that the Institution has always set itself. If we can adhere to our construction schedule, the Center should be completed sometime in January 1986.
Our continuing concern, once we have secured all the necessary construction funds, will be support for the programs for the Center itself, endowment on the one hand for exchange fellowships with the countries of the less-developed world, and on the other hand funds for exhibitions, seminars, festivals of the spirit, communion with all the nations and all their visitors of every description, so that the Center can bloom in intellectual splendor and grace. We are already being asked to submit proposals for continuing funds for endowment and grants in aid for these purposes. In another ten years, I would hazard, that should be the most active as well as ingenious program for cultural interchange in our country.
Other major gifts during the past year have come from our National Associates Board members, particularly Gaylord Donnelley, the Vernon Taylors, Brooks and Hope McCormick, Mary Burke, the James Kempers, Mr. and Mrs. Hadley Stuart, Mr. H. J. Heinz II, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Allbritton, Mrs. Elsie Hillman, Mr. and Mrs. Justin Dart, from foundations such as the Pew Memorial Trust (especially for continuing educational programs in the Center), the Japan Foundation, and from corporate sources both here and abroad. The response from our Associates, especially their National Board, has been a tribute to their dedication and understanding. (A list of donations is published on pp. 637-57 of Smithsonian Year 1983.) In effect, the programs of support for the Center are just beginning. From this person’s point of view, the creation of the Center and the response elicited and forthcoming have been the most heartening events at the Smithsonian in the past two years. For indeed these responses have been acts of faith.
On June 21, 1983, a date of significance, Chief Justice Burger, as Chancellor of the Smithsonian, and Vice-President Bush, a member of the Board of Regents, joined me in turning the first symbolic shovels of earth at the ground-breaking ceremony for our Center in the four-acre quadrangle area bordered by the Smithsonian’s Castle, the Arts and Industries Building, Independence Avenue, and the Freer Gallery of Art. This was a fitting climax to many years of hard work, meticulous planning, and concrete ex-

ing of computer parts. Approximately twenty-five participants came from France to share aspects of French regional traditions, music, food, and crafts. French-Americans also participated in the colorful festival. Thus, festival visitors could compare Old World traditions with the New World counterparts, influenced and changed by circumstances in this country.
Americans in Brittany and Normandy: 1860-1910 opened at the National Museum of American Art with 118 paintings focusing on the art colonies at Pont Aven in Brittany and Giverny in Normandy, villages which attracted many leading American artists during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
On May 24 the National Portrait Gallery placed on view the Gilbert Stuart “Edgehill” portrait of Thomas Jefferson, which had been purchased jointly in 1982 by the gallery and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, owners of Monticello, where the portrait will be exhibited alternately in three-year cycles
Other faces from the past were revealed in a mid-winter Portrait Gallery exhibition which was highly praised by critics and public alike. Hollywood Portrait Photographers showcased the mysterious, glamorous, perfected images of screen legends created by skilled photographers during the star-studded decades from 1925 to 1945.
The gallery revealed a very different world in October when it unveiled Charles Willson Peale and His World, the first exhibition in this century completely devoted to the creative, inventive, and curious personality who was one of late-eighteenth-century America’s most accomplished artists, passionate patriots, and pioneering natural scientists.
Smithsonian research in broad areas of science continued to flourish to the potential benefit of man and the creatures who share the globe with the human species. One striking example is the work of scientists from the National Museum of Natural History in exploring a heretofore inaccessible and virtually unstudied world, the unseen levels of the tropical forest canopy which rises 100 to 120 feet above the jungle floor. Thanks to revolutionary collecting methods developed by Smithsonian staff, our scientists are learning that the tropical forest canopy is populated by an incredible diversity of insect species—far more than anyone had ever guessed. Dr. Terry Erwin, who heads this research project in Peru,

estimates that there could be as many as 30 million species worldwide, not 1.5 million as usually estimated. These pioneering studies have far-reaching implications in a whole range of biological fields, from helping to explain the unparalleled biological richness of the Amazon basin to applications in forestry, agriculture, and medicine.
There is also great progress in the related work of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. During the year the Institute received a $1,029,000 grant from the Alton Jones Foundation to carry out a series of innovative research projects aimed at developing or improving agricultural methods that will allay destruction of tropical forests. The five-year multidisciplinary project is aimed at eventually providing methods to supply sufficient food for human populations without damaging the tropical forests. It will include exploring possibilities of new crop species in forest areas, maximizing the reproductive yield of pacas (a native animal) in captivity, managing the green iguana in the wild and the aquaculture of local fish species, and developing systems of exploiting as food sources the native animals that are not endangered.
In May 1983 the National Air and Space Museum published Black Wings: The American Black in Aviation, a pictorial history of the courageous men and women who overcame tremendous odds—financial, political, and social—to pursue their dreams of flight. Most of the photographs had never before been published. The book, which contains a selective bibliography and research guide, grew out of research for the exhibition of the same name which is on view in the museum’s Pioneers of Flight Gallery and a related symposium on black flyers of World War II, “The American Black in Aviation: A Decade of Change,” held in February 1983.
In a development designed to increase the efficiency of our science establishment, two bureaux were merged on July 1, 1983, into a single one, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, which will focus on the environment from both the molecular and whole-organisms point of view. The consolidated center results from the merging of the Radiation Biology Laboratory, located in Rockville, Maryland, and the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, located in Edgewater, Maryland, near Annapolis. It is directed by Dr. William H. Klein, former director of RBL.
In the meantime, research activities continued both in Rockville

against the new inventory findings and searching out either records or objects that appear to be missing or out of place.
Smithsonian Press continues to produce a variety of creative and informative publications. Among the works published in 1983 is The Muses Flee Hitler, an examination of the mass exodus of intellectuals from Europe during the Nazi regime. The volume includes twenty contributions by participants in the 1980 colloquium of the same name, organized by the Institution’s Office of Symposia and Seminars in honor of the centennial of the birth of Albert Einstein, perhaps the most famous such refugee.
Another Smithsonian publication focuses on a much broader span of history—and prehistory. Thread of Life: The Smithsonian Looks at Evolution, published in 1982, the centenary year of Charles Darwin’s death, delves into evolutionary biology to reveal not only the story of life on Earth but also the history of evolution as a fundamental scientific idea.
The twenty-fifth anniversary of the space age was marked in 1983 by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the National Air and Space Museum, both of which are involved in research into space exploration and its documentation. Sao successfully completed a balloon flight of a far-infrared spectrometer and telescope for spectral analysis of the molecular constituents of the Earth’s atmosphere.
Four new Regents’ Fellows were named in May 1983: Sir David R. Bates, professor of theoretical physics, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Queen’s University of Belfast, Northern Ireland; Dr. J. B. Burch, professor of biological science and curator of mollusks, University of Michigan; Dr. Thomas A. Sebeok, distinguished professor of linguistics and semiotics and professor of anthropology, Indiana University; and Dr. Ernest E. Williams, Alexander Agassiz professor of zoology at Harvard University. The Regents’ Fellowships were established in 1980 to encourage outstanding scholars and research scientists to participate in the research, curatorial, and educational programs of the Smithsonian. Through the fellows’ publications, the program contributes to the Institution’s traditional objective of the “increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
This year we awarded the first of the James E. Webb Fellowships, established in 1982 in honor of Mr. Webb on his retirement

<<<Page: 29>>>

from the Smithsonian Board of Regents. The fellowships are offered for the promotion of excellence in the management of cultural and scientific not-for-profit institutions, and three of the four recipients are Smithsonian employees.
In the nearly twenty years since I initiated the Institution’s domestic and foreign fellowship programs under Charles Blitzer and William Warner, the Smithsonian has become an academic crossroads, a major national force, counting some fourteen fellowship programs and internships including those stimulated by the dynamic Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Kennan Institute.
Crucial to much of this work in the international field have been the foreign currency accounts granted to us each year by the Congress from holdings held in U.S. Treasury agreements. Now, following the closing of the Egyptian account comes word of the imminent reduction of the Indian rupee account, and its final termination in fiscal year 1985. The opening of new realms of international understanding in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, presaged by the development of our Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures, which I have described in these pages, can be crippled drastically unless the novel and imaginative years of international exchange organized by our Institution are recognized for what they represent, new avenues of understanding between peoples. Let the Administrations of the future and the Congress ponder these pioneering efforts and reflect on how much the Smithsonian has accomplished in human terms at how small a cost. These programs are a model for the future and we hope to commission a volume report for their twentieth anniversary.
In 1853 an article in The Ohio Cultivator (vol. 9, p. 250) described the Smithsonian Institution, “endowed with a princely munificence” (a popular myth for the struggling young organization), as an intellectual humbug. The Institution was characterized as “Lying in State,” insensate, paralyzed, “a political hospital for the hungry pensioners of government.” If such a calumny could be visited upon us in 1853 (and if the statement was even noticed, I feel sure it would have been vigorously rebutted by Professor Joseph Henry), let me say at once that I believe the value of our unique and noble Institution has been shown in many ways. One of the more obvious ones is that the preservation of collections,

Archives of American Art, and we were fortunate to find Dr. Richard N. Murray, formerly director of the Birmingham (Alabama) Museum of Art, as his successor. Walter Boyne, a staff member of the National Air and Space Museum, was named director; and Dr. Irwin Shapiro, formerly of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was appointed director of the Center for Astrophysics, succeeding George Field who has returned to research and teaching. Dr. Theodore H. Reed has retired from the directorship of the National Zoological Park, where he has served for twentyeight years, and Robert Organ retired as director of the Conservation Analytical Laboratory after sixteen years of Smithsonian service.
We will be forever in debt to the aforementioned retirees and countless other Smithsonian staff who have moved on, just as we delight in seeing their successors settle in and bring fresh perspectives to their jobs. Knowing these and many other staff, I continue to delight in the truism that this Institution has long owed its greatness to a formidable cadre of talented, interested, and dedicated “Smithsonians,” as we call ourselves.
The Board of Regents
The first meeting of the Board of Regents was held on January 24, 1983, and opened with a warm and solemn tribute to Nancy Hanks, the late Regent. The Regents expressed their deep regret at the loss to the Institution by her death on January 7, recalling her splendid contributions to the arts and the Smithsonian.
The Audit and Review Committee reported on its joint meeting with the Personnel Committee on October 7, 1982. The committees discussed the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies, draft Standards of Conduct, the Institution’s tax status, the

indicating broad approval of the Institution’s efforts and ensuring their continuation. Gifts and grants from individuals, foundations, corporations, and Associates for operating projects as well as the Quadrangle also grew to a new level. The net revenues from nonappropriated sources permitted increased support to some activities, such as the Fellowship Program, as well as a greater transfer of funds to endowment, pursuant to the high priority of the Board of Regents on developing these permanent funds. In this regard, the substantial investment return of the Institution’s endowment funds further increased security for the future.
Operating Funds—Sources and Application
The overall operating budget of the Smithsonian grew by 10 percent in the past year, from $253,366,000 in fiscal year 1982 to $277,974,000 in fiscal year 1983. As shown in Table 1, these operating revenues were derived 53 percent from federal appropriations, 42 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 5 percent from federal agency grants and contracts.
Net operating funds, exclusive of the expenses of the nonappropriated auxiliary and bureau activities, grew by $23,807,000, and were derived 78 percent from federal appropriations, 15 percent from nonappropriated sources, and 7 percent from federal agency grants and contracts. Table 2 outlines the application of these funds by all Smithsonian bureaux, with supporting detail in the following tables.
Federal appropriations represent the largest single source of funds available to the Institution and provide the core support for the Institution’s programs in basic research, care, and exhibition of the National Collections, education and publication programs, as well as the maintenance and protection of the buildings.
In fiscal year 1983, federal support for the Institution’s operating programs totaled $147,256,000, an increase of $16 million, or 12 percent, over the previous year. Inflationary costs in utilities, salaries, communications and other costs accounted for over $9 million of this increase; the balance was applied to a variety of require-

ments primarily related to strengthening the care and security of the collections and buildings. Some $2.2 million was devoted to moving and operating costs associated with the occupancy of the recently completed Museum Support Center. An additional $2.5 million was provided for the replacement of obsolete security equipment, for the conversion of volatile nitrate photographic negatives to archival-quality film, and for contractual services required for the proper maintenance of Smithsonian facilities. Other increases included support for improvements to the multiple mirror telescope at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, for phased automation of library services, and for production of a film commemorating the signing of the Treaty of Paris. At the initiation of Congress, an amount of $1 million was also received for award to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in support of the activities of the National Symphony Orchestra as the resident orchestra of the Center.
Grants and contracts from federal agencies, a significant source of support for the Institution’s research activities, totaled $13,125,000 in fiscal year 1983, a slight decline from the previous year. As in past years, the majority of these funds were provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research programs at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Important projects underway in fiscal year 1983 included the development of a high-resolution Imager for the Roentgen Satellite, study of the solar corona and its effects on Earth, a program to analyze data provided by the Viking Satellite, and the satellite tracking program.
In addition to support received from NASA, $3.5 million was received from other government agencies, primarily the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation. Examples of the diverse programs supported by grant and contract funds include development of guidelines for the conservation and management of wild primates, the collection of biological specimens from the outer continental shelf, support for the 1983 Festival of American Folklife, and a study to improve student attitudes toward science-related careers.

Nonappropriated trust fund income is derived from gifts and grants, endowment and current fund investments, and revenueproducing activities. Gross revenues from these sources totaled $117,593,000 in fiscal year 1983, an increase of 8 percent over the previous year. After excluding costs of the auxiliary and bureau activities which are necessary to generate the sales revenues, the net income available for program purposes increased over the prior year by $7,813,000, to a total of $28,196,000. Application of these funds by bureau is reflected in Table 2.
Restricted fund revenues, available only for specified purposes, totaled $9,162,000 for the year, a substantial increase of $2,341,000 over fiscal year 1982. More than $5.4 million of this income was received from gifts and grants, $3 million from endowment investment income and interest earned on restricted current fund balances, and $800,000 from other sources such as fundraising activities of the Archives of American Art and Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the sales desk activities at the Freer Gallery of Art. As displayed in Table 4, these revenues provided major operating support for the Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port (now administered by the National Museum of Natural History), the Freer

1981) ; $380,000 (FY 1982); and $486,000 (FY 1983).
These funds were used by the Institution to continue allotments for a variety of program and support activities, particularly the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the National Museum of African Art, the Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Center, the Office of Folklife Programs, and the Office of Telecommunications. Special funding was also provided for the exhibition The Heritage of Islam, presented in the Thomas Mellon Evans Special Exhibits Gallery, for fundraising for construction of the Quadrangle Center, for a marine sanctuary program, and for developmental costs of a new, integrated personnel/payroll system.
As mentioned above, transfers were made to Special Purpose Funds for the Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach programs (approved by the Board of Regents for a second five-year period), fellowship awards to preand post-

doctoral fellows, and small research grants to Smithsonian professional staff.
Reflecting the favorable results of the Institution’s unrestricted funds, some $3 million was transferred to endowment, of which $2.5 million was added to unrestricted endowment funds and $500,000 was used, together with slightly over $200,000 of proceeds from the sale of the Belmont Conference Center, to endow the James E. Webb Fellowship Program. Transfers to Plant Funds included $2 million for construction of the Quadrangle Center and $5,000 to complete construction of the East Garden.
Special Foreign Currency Program
An appropriation of foreign currencies equivalent to $2 million was received under the Special Foreign Currency Program in fiscal year 1983 to continue a program of grants to United States institutions for field research and advanced professional training in areas related to Smithsonian interest and expertise. Accumulated from sales of surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 83-480, these currencies have been determined by the Treasury Department to be excess to the normal needs of the government. The application of these funds by country and discipline is contained in Table 8.

advance each year by the Board of Regents, based on studies of anticipated interest and dividend yields, the Institution’s programmatic needs, inflationary factors, and the five-year running average of market values, adjusted for capital additions or withdrawals. The income payout rate for fiscal year 1983 to restricted purpose and designated endowments in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund constituted a 5 percent increase over the prior year, while the payout to unrestricted endowments was held to a constant rate; this permitted a somewhat greater reinvestment to unrestricted endowments. As may be seen in Table 12, income payout for the year was $3,491,000, compared to $5,257,000 of yield (net of managerial and custodial fees), resulting in reinvestment into principal of $1,766,000 of yield excess to predetermined payout. In addition to transfers to Unrestricted Endowment and to the newly created James E. Webb Fellowship Endowment, described elsewhere, gifts and other transfers to the Pooled Consolidated Fund totaled $827,000 for the year.
Table 13 lists all Smithsonian endowment funds. Detail of the securities held in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund as of September 30, 1983, may be obtained upon request from the Treasurer of the Institution.

In addition, FONZ contributed other important financial and volunteer support to Zoo programs. Financial affairs of this organization are described separately elsewhere in Smithsonian Year 1983.
Reading is Fundamental, Inc., associated with the Institution since 1968, is an independent, separately incorporated entity dedicated to the improvement of reading abilities in children. Primary support is derived from private contributions and a federal contract with the Department of Education to operate the federal Inexpensive Book Distribution Program.
The Science Information Exchange, Inc. ceased operation on October 31, 1981. Under a contract with the Department of Commerce, the Institution has continued to provide the exchange with administrative and fiscal services necessary to closing out the operation, transferring the assets to the Department of Commerce, and paying the outstanding net liabilities. Effective September 1983, the closeout of all operations was concluded.
Accounting and Auditing
An annual audit of the Institution’s funds, federal and nonappropriated, is conducted by an independent public accounting firm; the Coopers and Lybrand report for fiscal year 1983 is contained in the following pages. Audits by the internal audit staff are also conducted throughout the year on a number of Smithsonian activities. Additionally, the Defense Contract Audit Agency conducts an annual audit of grants and contracts received from federal agencies, as well as their allocated administrative costs.
The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents met several times during the year pursuant to their responsibility under the bylaws of the Institution, for reviewing the Smithsonian’s accounting systems and internal financial controls; for facilitating communication between the Board of Regents and auditors from the internal audit staff, the independent accounting firm, and the General Accounting Office; and for reviewing operations of the Institution for compliance with approved programs and policies.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of presentation. These financial statements do not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (Institution) but are administered under separate boards of trustees. (See Note 2.)
The accounts of the federal funds have been prepared on the obligation basis of accounting, which basis is in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth in the Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The obligation basis of accounting differs in some respects from generally accepted accounting principles. Under this basis of accounting, commitments of the operating fund, such as purchase orders and contracts, are recognized as expenditures, and the related obligations are reported on the balance sheet even though goods and services have not been received. Such commitments aggregate $26,148,000 at September 30, 1983. In addition, construction commitments amounted to $30,630,000 at September 30, 1983.
The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from private sources, from federal grants and contracts, and from certain business activities related to the operations of the Institution. The federal funds reflect the receipt and expenditures of funds obtained from Congressional appropriations.
Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund accounting. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for funds control, accounting, and reporting purposes into funds established according to their appropriation, nature, and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.
The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institution are reported in self-balancing fund groups as follows:
Trust current funds, which include unrestricted resources, represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific purposes are segregated from other current funds.
Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to restrictions of gift instruments, requiring in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment and similar funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds.

<<<Page: 55>>>

Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing board for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.
Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisitions and funds expended for plant. Pledges for the construction of The Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures are recorded as gifts in the plant fund in the period the pledge document is received.
Federal operating funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of Institution operations. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—Salaries and Expenses appropriations, Special Foreign Currency appropriations, and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund.
The balance of this fund represents amounts available for support of specific Institution operations including the Special Foreign Currency Program, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Appropriations, and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund.
Federal construction funds represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for building and facility construction, restoration, renovation, and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropriation—Construction and Improvements, National Zoological Park, Restoration and Renovation of Buildings and Museum Support Center.
Federal capital funds represent the amount of the investment of the United States Government in the net assets of the Institution acquired
with federal funds and nonexpendable property transfers from Government agencies.
Investments. All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of investments are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar manner, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds.
Inventory. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or retail cost method (for those inventories held for resale).
Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription, which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian magazine are charged against income over the period of the subscription.
The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.
Works of art, living or other specimens. The Institution acquires its collections, which include works of art, library books, photographic archives, objects and specimens, through purchase or by donation of the items themselves. In accordance with policies generally followed by museums, no value

<<<Page: 56>>>

is assigned to the collections on the statement of financial condition. Purchases for the collections are expensed currently.
Property and equipment. Capital improvements and equipment purchased with trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to 10 years. Equipment purchased with trust funds for use by non-income-producing activities is treated as a deduction of the current fund and a capitalized cost of the plant fund. Depreciation on equipment capitalized in the plant fund is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 3 to 10 years (see Note 9). Equipment purchased with federal funds is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Real estate (land and buildings) purchased with trust funds is recorded at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values. Costs of original building structures and major additions are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 30 years. Costs of renovating, restoring and improving structures are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 15 years (see Note 9).
Buildings and other structures, additions to buildings, and fixed equipment purchased with federal funds are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 30 years.
Certain lands occupied by the Smithsonian Institution’s buildings were appropriated and reserved by the Congress for that purpose and are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. Property and nonexpendable equipment acquired through transfer from Government agencies are capitalized at the transfer price or at estimated amounts taking into consideration their usefulness, condition, and market value.
Government contracts. The Institution has a number of contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the Institution. Contract revenue is recognized when billable or received in the trust funds.
Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these statements since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.
Annual leave unfunded. The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual leave in accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the cost of leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense. The cost of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accompanying financial statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal funds.
2. Related activities
The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several separately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution

<<<Page: 57>>>

facilities occupied, etc. totaled approximately $313,000 for the year ended September 30, 1983. The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these organizations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1983, as reflected in their individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the Institution:

Effective October 1, 1982, the deposit with the U.S. Treasury has been invested in U.S. Government securities at a variable yield based on market interest rates. Substantially all the investments of the endowment and similar funds are pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $210.27, 291,970 units were owned by endowment, and 329,523 units were owned by quasi-endowment at September 30, 1983.
The following tabulation summarizes changes in relationships between cost and market values of the pooled investments:

<<<Page: 59>>>

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from the current funds.
In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such factors as, but not limited to: (1) 442% of the five-year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2) current dividends and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scientists, and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index; however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less than 110°/o of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received. The total return factor for 1983 was $6.24 per unit to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $5.00 per unit to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds; new units were purchased for the Unrestricted Endowment Funds with the $1.24, the difference in the total return factor. The total return applied for 1983 was $2,373,000 to the Restricted and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $1,117,000 to the Unrestricted General Purpose Endowment Funds.
7. Receivables
Receivables at September 30, 1983 included the following:

8. Advance payments
Advance payments represent advances made to Government agencies, educational institutions, firms and individuals for services to be rendered or property or materials to be furnished.

<<<Page: 60>>>

As of September 30, 1983, the Institution has advances outstanding to the U.S. Government of approximately $10,179,000, principally for construction services to be received in the future. The Institution at that date also had advances outstanding to educational institutions amounting to approximately $2,068,000, principally under the Special Foreign Currency Program.
9. Property and equipment
At September 30, 1983, property and equipment which has been capitalized (see Note 1) is comprised of the following:

Depreciation and amortization expense for 1983 for trust funds income-producing assets amounted to approximately $1,436,000, which is included in auxiliary activities expenditures in the current funds. Effective October 1, 1982, the Institution capitalized non-income-producing equipment net of accumulated depreciation, as well as, recognized depreciation on buildings previously capitalized but not depreciated. The effect of this change was not material to these financial statements. Depreciation of trust funds non-incomeproducing equipment and buildings for 1983 amounted to approximately $3,340,000.
Depreciation expense reflected in expenditures of the Capital Funds of 1983 was $7,586,000.
The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1983, includes $24,555,000 of unexpended plant funds.

<<<Page: 61>>>

10. Pension plan
The Institution has separate retirement plans for trust and federal employees. Under the trust fund’s plan, both the Institution and employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1983, was $3,037,000. It is the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently. There are no unfunded prior service costs under the plan.
The federal employees of the Institution are covered by the Civil Service Retirement Program. Under this program, the Institution withholds from the gross pay of each federal employee and remits to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) the amounts specified by such program. The Institution contributes 7% of basic annual salary to the Fund. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1983, was approximately $5,500,000.
11. Excess of expenditures and other deductions
The net excess of expenditures and other deductions over revenue and other additions disclosed for federal operating fund in the Statement of the Activity for the year ended September 30, 1983, arose because certain multiyear appropriations, having been recorded as income in prior years and carried forward as fund balance, were expended during the year.
12. Nonmandatory transfers for designated purposes
The following transfers among trust funds were made for the year ended September 30, 1983, in thousands of dollars:

13. Income taxes
The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that section are taxable only on their unrelated business income, which was immaterial for the Institution for 1983.
It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such dual status.
