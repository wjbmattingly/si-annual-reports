UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U.S. National Museum.

I.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became
the only lawful place of deposit for ‘all objects of art and of foreign
and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and
geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States.”
These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum
of the United States. For many years this Museum was supported
entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, and a considerable por-
tion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or
purchase.

A “museum” has been defined by Professor Huxley as ‘‘ a consultative
library of objects.” Not only is the National Museum such a consulta-
tive library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people of the
wholecountry. It keepsin mind the needs of those whose lives are not
occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and the skilled
investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve to hun-
dreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the United States who
enter its halls every year,and through the distribution of the duplicate
specimens in the Museum, made up into sets and accurately named, to
public institutions in all parts of the country.

Among the most important features of the operations of the Museum
during the year may be mentioned the reorganization of the exhibits in
several of the departments, notably in the departments of mammals
and prehistoric anthropology. Entire rearrangement of these collec.
tions has been effected, with a very gratifying result.

A large number of the curators have been necessarily engaged in the
preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition. This work has, of

course, interfered seriously with the realization of the plans previously
laid out by them for the development of their respective departments.
Several curators were absent from the Museum for a considerable
portion of the year. Two were detailed by the Museum to cooperate
with the United States Fish Commission in certain special investiga-
tions of aquatic life off the coast of Alaska, and others were absent
in the field for several months.

A.—ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been
detailed in previous reports, and was made the special subject of a
paper entitled ‘‘The Genesis of the National Museum.”' For our pres-
ent purpose it will suffice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as
there stated.

The formation of a national museum in the city of Tiactineion was
first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called ‘The National
Institution,” and afterwards “The National Institute,” which was for
four years exceedingly prosperous and active. The nucleus for a
national museum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office
building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the
Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing
the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive,
and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence. In the meantime the
Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858,
when the so-called “‘ National Academy of Curiosities ” passed into the
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term ‘‘ National Museum”
was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to
designate the collections in the Smithsonian building.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the
plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes
of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be pro-
vided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.?

After the “national cabinet” had been delivered to the Regents,
annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance.
During the iy eauyanree years which followed, the collections were

greatly increased and were made the basis of numerous important
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The
public halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of
the collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain
amount of instruction and pleasure was afforded to visitors. The
appropriations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staff
was so inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collee-
tions in good preservation.

The broad plan upon which the operations of the National Museum
are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor
Henry wrote:

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.!

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were
appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much
emphasis of the difficulties attending the assuming by the Institution
of the care of the national collections, and in the report of the Institu-
tion for 1870” he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims
proper to such a museum.

There is [he wrote| scarcely any subject connected with science and
education to which more attention is given at the present day than
that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the gen-
eral denomination of museums. This arises from their growing impor-
tance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.

In the report for 1873° allusion was made to the increase in the
national collections, even then very great, “requiring the utmost exer-
tions of the limited force connected with the National Museum for its
proper treatment.”

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been
mcre liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as
ever is still needed in the development of its plans for the future.

The Smithsonian Institution from its foundation fostered explora-
tions, and its museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological
and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many
gifts were received from private sources, and valuable objects were
deposited in its Museum for safe-keeping. The nucleus of its collec-
tions was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the
founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist
of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval
expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized by

the Government, and during their progress large collections of ethno-
logical and natural history objects were made. Important foreign
material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition, Perry’s
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists
attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Sur-
vey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps, brought together
great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of
North America.

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of
the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission.
The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission
found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside
the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific
work.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the
United States Government and those of numerous foreign governments
and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum.

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of
the Smithsonian building were already overflowing with the accumula-
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring
for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requisite
work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new and
broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of the
country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many
local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and
from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient
methods of museum administration. The exhibition of 1876 had been
indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of-the
United States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it
taught as to the possibilities for good in public museums.

The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were
given to the United States for its National Museum were of large intrin-
sic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity
of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion
of the Museum itself.

In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the
Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all nec-
essary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had
never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganiza-
tion was made in 1881, under the immediate care of the present Assist-
ant Secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to
establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge
of a curator.

There are now 28 organized departinents and sections in the Museum,
the larger number of which are in charge of specialists who receive no
salary from the Museum. There are also 7 administrative offices.

SPECIAL EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the National Museum may be divided into three
periods:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution
to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as
materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to
the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific
description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the cus.
tody of the “National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections
which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient,
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve
an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the
Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering
collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an
educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scien-
tific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of
record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added
the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and
education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential
to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all,

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material founda-
tions of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those
materials that have served as a foundation for the reports upon the
resources of the United States.

It is @ museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in
the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scien-
tific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group
the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its
officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators, as well
as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by
specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of
human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted
to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named
series of duplicates.

In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accom-
plished since the time of reorganization in 18381.

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected, efficient
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occa-
sion may require, and many capable museum experts have been trained
for work in other institutions.

(2) Through the agency of this staff the materials in the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control and arranged in such manner as to
insure their safety and make them available for study.

(3) The collections have been increased nearly seventeen fold during
the last fourteen years.

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development
of a well-labeled and effectually installed exhibition series, available
for the instruction of the pubhe.

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica-
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and
which will be made available for other institutions from time to time
through the publications of the Museum.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi-
ment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed else-
where have been adopted. Our new methods are being applied in
many sunilar establishments at home and abroad.

(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models has been
advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of the
experts in the employ of the Museum.

8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
specialists in the production of these papers has greatiy enhanced the
value of the national collections.

(9) Popular educational work of unquestioned value has been accom-
plished by participation in the great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin,
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.

(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distrib-
uted to other museums and to colleges and schools.

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

That the United States must have a National Museum worthy of the
dignity of the nation is self-evident.

Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital
city—centers of scientific and educational activity—the treasure-house
of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields of
science, art, and industrial progress.!

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and UTE ee persone, visiting a country, very

and triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this field of work.

properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili-
zation of the people.

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable
nor desirable to gather together in this city extensive collections of
ancient medieval art, but a representative series of such objects will
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public. taste,
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza-
tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished,
attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geol-
ogy and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the
preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour-
agement of the arts and industries of our own people.

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem.
bered that the national collections of every principal HKuropean nation
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration,
though often within the general control of some central authority. In
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart-
ment of Science and Art.

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive
names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand,
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate—col-
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different
parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division
of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any depart-
ment is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied
and compared side by side. In Washington, the national collections
are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings.
The Army Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with
those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this prox-
imity, in connection with the long-established policy of cooperation
between the two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes,
united in interest.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of the National Museum are small, compared with those in
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi-
viduals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contribu-
tions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000
a year, and in some years it has been greater.
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Among important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin Indian
gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and ethnologist;
the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley;
the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Phila-
delphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000
conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the
collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the Rey.
L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large and
valuable collections of African mammals, birds, etc., made and presented
by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr. William Astor Chanler; the Bendire and
Ralph collections of American birds’ eggs, given to the Smithsonian
Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection of
the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of which
from Philadelphia to Washington a special appropriation was made by
Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not
yet come into its possession. It is estimated that within the past fifteen
years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to
the Museum to the value of $100 each or more.

The National Museum now contains nearly three and a half millions
of objects.

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be ex-
pressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others
worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and price-
less. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their com-
pleteness and to the labor which has been expended on them, can not
be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize
more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their
value would amount to several millions of dollars.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1895 the number of
specimens is almost eighteen times as great as in 1882.

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent,
less perhaps in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or
Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire
Museum is. the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions,
and of the gifts prompted by the generosity of the American people.

As night be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contri-
butions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to
museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of the
collections for study by specialists and for general educational pur-
poses.

The need of a larger fund for the purchase of Specimens is yearly be-
coming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ial

offered at prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by
collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken
by the museums and institutions of Europe.

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book
from which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narra-
tive is disjointed and incomplete.

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centu-
ries. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. In needs, more than any
museum in Kurope, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since 1889 has averaged less than $6,000 a
year.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum,
from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of
nearly $47,000.

Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta-
tistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her
average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in
London is not less than $500,000 a year.

Our museum is the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern-
ment. Jhrough a thousand channels materials for the formation of a
museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such
materials our museum has been built. A museum formed in this man-
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome,
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied,
might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it
has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies
can be supplied only by purchase.

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by
limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have,
however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed,
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of
the Institution.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the ‘keeper
of the Smithsonian Museum,” and the Assistant Secretary, by the usage
of nearly fifty years, its executive head.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In the act of Congress passed in 1846, to establish the Smithsonian
Institution, are contained the following provisions concerning the scope
of the museum to be placed under its charge:

1. The act above referred to provides that ‘‘all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or
hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city
of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and together with new specimens obtained by
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classi-
fied as best to facilitate examination and study.

2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive
them.

3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study.

4. It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to
be inclosed for the Institution.

5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange
of duplicate specimens and by gift, and directs also that they shall
be appropriately classified and arranged.

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit
for all objects of art, archeology, ethnology, natural history, miner-
alogy, geology, ete., belonging to the United States or collected by any
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress.

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily
of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison.

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three directions:

1. The permanent preservation of the collections already in its posses-
sion, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators and the
skill of the preparators.

2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired—

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in
accordance with law;

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from
foreign Governments;

(3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or for publications;
_ (4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections
in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special
Service of this nature;

(5) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for
that purpose.

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating
the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled
by the best authorities.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. td

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large
extent of the following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumu-
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution.

2, Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian
Institution in connection with educational institutions or commercial
establishments.

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States
ministers and consuls.

4, The collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

5. Collections made by the scientific officers of Government sur-
veys, such as the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Bound-
ary Survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of
the United States Army and by officers of the Signal Corps of the
United States Army stationed in remote regions.

6. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey,
the United States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the
activities of the United States Department of Agriculture and
other departments of the Government.

7. The remnant of the collections of the old ‘ National Institute.”

8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial
Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed
by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at
Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained
from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati
Exposition in 1887, and the World’s Columbian Exposition in
1893.

9, The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876.

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the
Philadelphia Exhibition and subsequently.

11. The materials received from museums in Europe and America
in exchange for duplicate specimens.

12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.

The publications of the Museum consist of—

1. The Annual Report.

2. The Proceedings of the National Museum.
3. The Bulletin of the National Museum.

4, The series of circulars.

Papers by members of the Museum staff based upon the collections
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States
and in many of those of Europe.
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, although it bears the name of a for-
eigner, has for half a century been one of the most important agencies
in the intellectual life of our people. It has been a rallying point for
the workers in every department of scientific and educational work,
and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of
research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other coun-
tries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes,
are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of
them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientific investigator.
Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of the
national collection at the Capitol, and its Museum is the richest in
existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of
the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their
best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science
to whom our country has given birth, have passed their entire lifetime
in working for its success.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the
past forty-three years nearly one and a half million packages of books
and other scientific and literary materials have been distributed to
every region of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far-
reaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art and literature, or of American institutions
generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound,
vigorous, and progressive.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi-
cations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com-
inission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the
United States as an example of what governments should do for the
suppert of their scientific institutions.

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it
is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor mere in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address,
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions Jor the
general diffusion of knowledge.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. HS

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public
opinion, it should be enlightened,

No one has yet explained, except by conjecture, why James Smithson
selected the United States as the seat of his foundation. He had no
acquaintances in America, nor does he appear to have had any books
relating to America except two. Rhees quotes from one of these (Trav-
els through North America, by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Soci-
ety) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000
inhabitants, in which it is predicted that “the Federal city, as soon
as navigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly,” and that, at a
future day, if the affairs of the United States go on as prosperously
as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the West and
rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World.

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realiz-
ing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organi-
zations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an
institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of ineal-
culable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the
United States would have been to-day without this bequest?

Well did President John Quincey Adams say:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of
mankind,

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution
has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year
since 1846—intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant
cooperation with the Government, public institutions, and individuals
in every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed advice,
support, or aid from its manifold resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the
extent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them.
The most important of these are the library and the Museum, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

THE LIBRARY.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of
the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive
system of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been
used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all
parts of the world.

The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened
must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest
of Smithson.'! Many of the publications in each of these series are now
out of print.

1This estimate is based upon the prices which are charged for the books by second-
hand dealers, as shown in their sale catalogues.
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In return for these, and by purchase, it has received the great col-
lection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest
in the world in the publications of learned societies, and therefore of
inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress
in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the
human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of every
branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until
the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol,
as a portion of the Congressional Library.

The Smithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred
thousand volumes and parts of volumes, constituting perhaps one-
fourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its
own upon the main floor of the new Library Building. The rapidity
with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that in the last two
years 67,589 titles were added. '

The I Pen racien has probably done more toward building up a great
library in Washington than would have been possible, had all its income
been devoted strictly to lhbrary work, as was at one time seriously
proposed.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though their
number has been so largely increased, year by year, now forming one
of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only
remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition
than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which it is
hoped will soon be remedied.

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con-
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the Institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest.

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways;
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of
the nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian histitution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially reorganized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution,
the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus
for a national museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith-
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords
each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. Inaddi-
tion to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of
information on scientific topics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object
or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered
promptly and fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are
sent which will enable them to find out such names for themselves in
future. This work has not only an educational value, but often a great
economic importance as well, as, for instance, when some common min-
eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been
wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some
harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively
stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been
given to the Government than has been received. The maciinery of the
Institution’s action has been such that it has incidentally, in connec-
tion with its legitimate work for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge, paid over to the Government the equivalent of much more than
the whole original fund.

The present Secretary has pointed out that ‘‘although by the judi-
cious administration of the Smithson fund nearly $1,500,000, the fruits
of its investment, have been applied during the past forty years to the
advancement of science and education in America (in addition to the
principal, $911,000, larger now than ever before), it should be remem-
bered that the unrestricted income of the Institution is less than

NAT MUS 95 2

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

$60,000 a year, a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than
ever in previous years.”

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be
borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution
has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, prop-
erty acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in
value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest?

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con-
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution,
it should be said that it is in the ghest degree advantageous. It
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum,
since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years
it has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it
has received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the
use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of
paramount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers
of the Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous
correspondents.

C.—THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not
only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render
the resources of science available to the public at large.

The National Museum isa treasure-house filled with materials for the
use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the
people of the whole country.

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows:

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few,
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to
maintain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an
attractive as well as an intelligible form.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution. and no
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than
the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from all
parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the dis
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums.

In the next annual report it will be shown how many hundred thou-
sands of objects have been thus distributed during the past twenty
years. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way,
and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself,
contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum
in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States
were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and
sunilar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to
national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a
very considerable extent, directly and personally.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every citizen.

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find
no welcome among us.

The experience of Europe, with its magnificent public museums and
the history of the several expositions in the United States, should be
quite sufficient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the
museum is an educational power even more influential than the public
library.

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir
Philip Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years,
not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the
score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of Great
Britain, remarked to the writer:

We educate our working people in the public schools, give them a love for refined

and beautiful objects, and stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave
school, go into the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

eratification of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire, It is as much
the duty of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their
higher education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction.

In the same conversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could
not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and exam-
inations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council
of Edueation, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the
chief agencies.
II—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

The changes already made in the form of the Annual Report, begin-
ning with the volume for 1893, have been continued in this volume. It
is believed that they have proved advantageous in many ways.

The most important innovation in Part 1 of this Report is the
Appendix which relates to the statement concerning the Library of the
National Museum. This consists of a complete list of all accessions
to the library during the year 1894-95, but does not include books
belonging to the Smithsonian library which have been withdrawn for the
purposes of the National Museum.

The headings which follow indicate the topics which are thought to
be of special importance in connection with both the scientific and
administrative operations of the Museum during the year.

THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The number of organized departments and sections in the Museum
is now 28. There are 7 administrative divisions.

Hon. Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological
Survey, has been appointed honorary curator of all the paleontological
collections, which are now embraced in the department of paleontology.
The names of those in charge of the various sections of this department
are mentioned in Appendix I.

Mr. J. E. Watkins was appointed curator of the technological
collections in February, 1895.

In May Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. N., was detailed by the Secretary of
the Navy to serve again as honorary curator of the section of materia
medica in the National Museum, fhus relieving Medical Inspector
Daniel MeMurtrie, U.S. N.

Mr. F. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger were detailed in the
spring of 1895 to report to the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries
for the purpose of accompanying an expedition to Alaska and the
adjacent islands, with a view to studying the seal rookeries. They were
temporarily transferred to the roll of the Fish Commission for this
work.

On July 1, 1894, Mr. R. E. Earll was appointed editor of the Pro-
ceedings and Bulletins of the Museum. Later in the year he was
appointed special agent on behalf of the Museum for the Cotton States

and International Exposition to be held at Atlanta.
21
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. Theodore Gill and Dr. R. EK. C. Stearns are now recognized as
Associates in zoology, Dr. C. A. White, in paleontology, and Dr. R. W.
Shufeldt, in comparative anatomy.

In January Dr. G. P. Merrill was detailed for special duty in the
office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury.

Mr. F. H. Knowlton resigned on July 5, 1894, although he is still
connected with the Museum in an honorary capacity as custodian of
mesozoie plants.

During the year Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agriculture,
was appointed honorary assistant curator of the department of botany
in the Museum, and Mr. R. S. Matthews was appointed an aid in the
department of mammals.

On October 1, 1894, Dr. Walter Hough was appointed assistant
curator of the department of ethnology; Mr. Charles W. Richmond was
appointed an assistant in the department of birds on July 1 of the same
year, and on November 1 Miss M. J. Rathbun, connected with the
department of marine invertebrates, was made an assistant curator.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson was designated assistant in charge of the
department of mollusks on May 17, during the absence in Alaska of
Dr. Dall, honorary curator.

ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The accession entries relating to material received during the year
have occupied Nos. 28312 to 29534, inelusive, giving a total of 1,223
separate lots. This is an increase of 62 over the preceding year, and
any increase is the more remarkable from the fact that with very few
exceptions no effort whatever has been made to induce persons to
deposit their collections in the National Museum. This undesirable
policy has been made necessary by the entire lack of additional exhibi-
tion space. ‘The material received during the year has for the most part
been placed in storage, It amounts to 127,524 specimens of all kinds.
The three departments receiving the largest increases were prehistoric
anthropology, mollusks, and insects. An effort has been made to
obtain from the curators figures representing the number of specimens
received during the year, as well as the total number of specimens in
their departments on June 30, 1895. The appended tables, A and B,
Show the results. It is shown that there are now 3,406,855 specimens
of all kinds in the custody of the Museum.

The table indicating in parallel columns the totals in the different
departments at the end of each year since 1882 has been withdrawn, as it
was found that without numerous footnotes it was impossible to account
for the discrepancies which appeared to exist from a comparison of the
totals of one year with another in the light of the table giving the num-
ber of specimens received in each department during the year. This
last number added to the total for the previous year seldom gave the
actual total for the year following, on account of specimens withdrawn
for distribution and otherwise disposed of, On the other hand, as in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 20

the department of geology, the total for a given year was liable to
exceed the total for the previous year by more than the number repre-
senting the specimens obtained during the year. This might be readily
accounted for by the fact that one large specimen upon its arrival
would not unfrequently be broken into a large number of smaller ones.
Hence the necessity for numerous explanatory notes arose, and for this
reason the arrangement of these tables, as here given, will be adopted
in future reports of the Museum.

TRANSFER OF THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM.

In 1869 the National Herbarium was transferred from the Smithsonian
Institution to the Department of Agriculture. The reasons for this
transfer are given under the head of ‘“‘ Review of work in the scientific
departments.” Within the last year, however, a formal communication
was received from the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture proposing
that the Herbarium be again housed by the Smithsonian Institution.
The reasons for the desired change are given in the letter of the Assist-
ant Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 24, 1894, which is reprinted
in the chapter referred to above. The proposition was agreed to by the
Smithsonian Institution, and the actual transfer of the Herbarium took
place in September of the same year.

EXCHANGES OF SPECIMENS WITH INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS
ABROAD,

The Museum has for many years maintained exchanges of specimens
not only with domestic institutions but also, and chiefly, with foreign
museums. This practice has enabled the Museum to dispose profita-
bly of its duplicates, and at the same time to furnish museums and
colleges in other countries with valuable American material for display
or study. The-Museum has exchange relations with almost every
museum of importance in the world. Exchanges of specimens not infre-
quently lead to exchanges of publications also, and by this means the
Museum library has received numerous accessions. Especially has this
been the case since 1894, when a special effort was made to obtain from
foreign museums publications which at that time were wanting on our
shelves.

The exchanges of specimens with institutions at home are so indicated
in the Accession List, which is printed as Appendix 11. The exchanges
with foreign museums and other institutions and individuals abroad
are here briefly referred to.

FOREIGN EXCHANGES IN 1894-95.

Birds.—Birds’ skins have been sent to Mr. A. Boucard, Oak Hill,
Spring Vale, Isle of Wight, England, in continuation of exchanges.

From the La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina (Dr. Francisco P.
Moreno, director), have been received birds’ skins. Similar material
has been transmitted in exchange.

Birds’ skins have been forwarded to Mr. Victor Ritter von Tschusi
zu Schmidhoffen, Hallein, Salzburg, Austria, in exchange for material
already received.

Nineteen birds’ skins have been sent to Rey. H. B. Tristram, The
College, Durham, England, in continuation of exchanges.

Reptiles and batrachians.—Two specimens of Menobranchus Latastei
have been received from Dr. John H. Garnier, Lucknow, Ontario,
Canada.

From the Museum Senckenbergianum, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Ger-
many, have been received, through Dr. O. Boettger, two lizards from
China. <A specimen of Anniella pulchra and two specimens of Ter-
rapene ornata have been forwarded in return.

Fishes.—A east of a fish has been sent to Dr. Ehrenbaum, director,
Biological Station, Heligoland. Marine invertebrates have been asked
for in return.

From the Indian Museum, Caleutta, India (Surg. Capt. A. Alcock,
superintendent), have been received specimens of deep-sea fishes from

the Bay of Bengal. Highty-three species of deep-sea fishes from the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans have been transmitted in exchange.

Forty species of deep-sea fishes have been sent to Dr. L. Lortet,
director of the Museum of Natural History, Lyons, France, for which
material has been promised in return.

Mollusks.—British invertebrates have been received from the Man-
chester Museum, Manchester, England, through Mr. William EK. Hoyle,
in return for material already forwarded.

Dr. H. von Ihering, director, Paulista Museum, San Paulo, Brazil, has
transmitted specimens of Unionide from Central and South America.
Specimens of Unionide from the United States have been sent in
return for material received and for additional specimens promised.

Specimens of Anodonta fragilis have been sent to Mr. J. F. Whiteaves,
of the Geological Survey of Canada.

Insects.—From Mr. Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Waterworks,
South Australia, have been received two specimens of Honey Ant
(Camponotus inflatus) from Alice Springs, MacDonnel Ranges, Central
Australia. Foraminifera have been sent in return.

From Felippo Silvestri, Museo Civico di Storia Naturale, Genoa,
Italy, has been received a collection of European myriapods, repre-
senting twenty-six species. North American myriapods have been sent
in return.

From G. van Roon, Rotterdam, Holland, have been received thirteen
species of Coleoptera from India and fifty-one species of Coleoptera
from Europe. Similar material has been sent in return.

Marine invertebrates—From Kdgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Water-
works, South Australia, have been received Foraminifera from South
Australia. An equivalent in similar material has been sent.

A specimen of Pentacrinus decorus has been transmitted to Dr. L.

COOPERATION OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The large annual increase in the national collections is due in no
small degree to the aid which the Executive Departments of the Gov-
ernment have extended in various ways. Much valuable assistance
has also been rendered by officials of the Departments who have found
it practicable to perform certain work in the interest of the Museum
without interfering with their official duties.

In the Department of State, Hon. W. W. Rockhill, who has made
very liberal contributions to the collection in past years, is one of the
warmest friends of the Museum. Mr. R. D. L. Mohun, of the Consular
Bureau, has presented a large and valuable collection of ethnological
objects from the Kongo region. Mr. Isaac Townsend Smith has been
instrumental, in his capacity of consul-general of Siam, in forwarding
to the Museum, in behalf of the King of Siam, through his Royal
Highness Prince Devagongse Varaprakar, minister of foreign affairs,
Bangkok, Siam, a Siamese edition of the sacred writing ‘Tripitaka”
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

of the southern Buddhists. Mr. R. M. Bartleman, chargé d’affaires of
the United States at Caracas, Venezuela; Hon. C. H. Benedict, United
States consul at Cape Town, Africa; Mr. N. C. Gram, United States
consular agent at Dryefjord, Iceland, have also extended their friendly
offices in increasing the collections.

The Museum is indebted to the Treasury Department for the prompt
manner in which free entry has been granted for material obtained
from many parts of the world. This courtesy has been extended over
a long period of years.

Lieut. J. H. Seott and Mr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Revenue- Marine
Service, have given their personal aid in adding to the collections.

Mr. Isaae Winston, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
has also been a contributor.

In the War Department the same friendly spirit of cooperation has
been manifested. The Quartermaster’s Department has saved the
Museum both time and money in connection with the transportation to
Washington of heavy material from remote localities. Several Army
officers have made contributions of interesting specimens tothe Museum.
Among these are Capt. P. H. Ray, Lieut. W. N. Hughes, Lieut. Wirt
Robinson, Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, and Dr. ©. E,
Woodruff. Inthe same way the Museum is indebted to several officers
of the Navy for addition to the collections—Rear-Admiral R. W. Meade,
Lient. Charles Emmerich, Lieut. C. H. Harlow, and Lieut. Herbert
Winslow. In the latter part of May, 1895, Dr. James M. Flint was
again assigned to duty in the Museum as honorary curator of the sec-
tion of materia medica, and the renewal of his official connection with
the Museum is a source of sincere gratification.

Under the Department of the Interior the principal accessions to
the collections have been received through the Geological Survey.
The material thence derived is alluded to in the List of Accessions
(Appendix 11). The following officers have extended personal assist-
ance to the Museum during the year, either by collecting geological
material or by cooperating with the geological work of the Museum:
Mr. Whitman Cross, Dr. David T. Day, Mr. Frank Burns, Mr. J. 5S.
Diller, Mr. G. H. Eldridge, Mr. S. F. Emmons, Mr. Arnold Hague,
Mr. W. P. Jenney, Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Prof. S. L. Penfield, Mr. W.
Sardeson, Mr. J. E. Spurr, Mr. T. W. Stanton, Mr. W. H. Turner, and
Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan.

The Director of the Survey, Mr. Charles D. Walcott, has assumed
charge of the paleontological department of the Museum, an arrange-
ment which can not fail to redound greatly to the advantage of the
latter. Dr. William H. Dali, Prof. Lester F. Ward, and Prot. I’. W.
Clarke, officers of the Survey, continue to act as honorary curators in
the Museum, and to their active and earnest cooperation is due toa
large extent the progress which has been made in the geological work
of the Museum.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of the Indian Office, has made several valuable
gifts of ethnological material to the Museum during the year. Dr.
William J. Elstun, of the Pension Office, has also been a contributor.

Several collections have been transferred to the Museum by the Fish
Commission. From the material received from this source a large
number of specimens have been distributed to educational institutions
throughout the country, over fifty collections having been sent out
during the year.

Prof. B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, Mr. Charles H. Townsend,
and Mr. ©. W. Kendall have been personally instrumental in obtaining
interesting material for the collections.

A number of important accessions have been received from the
Department of Agriculture. Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Mr. L. O. Howard,
Dr. A. K. Fisher, Messrs. E. W. Nelson, C, L. Pollard, and Theo. Per-
gande have rendered conspicuous assistance to the Museum. Prof.
C. V. Riley, Mr. F. V. Coville, and Dr. C. W. Stiles have continued to
act in an honorary capacity. Many botanical- collections are received
direct by the Department of Agriculture. These are in due time
incorporated with the National Herbarium according to law. The cir-
cumstances which led to the transfer of the National Herbarium from
the Department of Agriculture to the National Museum building are
referred to at length in another place.

The Bureau of Ethnology, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution,
has transmitted large and valuable collections of ethnological objects
from Indian tribes in different sections of the country.

COLLECTORS’ OUTFITS.

During the year outfits have b2en furnished to collectors as follows:
To Mr. A. W. Ridgway, Point Lookout, Md.; to Capt. James P. Hare,
Avery, La.; to Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, San Diego, Cal.; to Mrs. Con-
stance McElroy, Livingston, Guatemala; to Mr. F. W. True, U. 8.
National Museum, for collecting in Alaska; to Mr. Frank C. Dennis,
Livingston, Guatemala; to Rev. D. W. Snyder, Luebo, Congo Free
State; to Mr. F. W. Urich, honorary secretary of the Trinidad Field
Naturalists’ Club, Port-of-Spain, British West Indies; to Mr. O. Bangs,
Micco, Brevard County, Fla.; to Mr. R. S. Matthews, U.S. National
Museum, for.collecting in West Virginia; to Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Florida
Agricultural College, Lake City, Fla.; to Lieut. Wirt Robinson, steam-
Ship Venezuela, Brooklyn, N. Y., and to Mr. William Palmer, U. S.
National Museum, for use during a collecting trip in Fiorida.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

The changes in the exhibition halls of the Museum have not been
very extensive during the year. Most of the alterations were made
with a view to exhibiting to better advantage the collections previously
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

installed, or for the purpose of making room for small, though in some
cases important, collections or individual objects recently acquired.

The collection illustrating the religions of eastern Asia (Brahmanism,
Buddhism, and Shintoism) was installed and labels prepared for many
of the objects. The collection of Assyrian seals and other small casts
is now installed in four Kensington cases, and a number of objects
relating to the Greco-Roman religion have also been placed upon exhi-
bition. The casts of reliefs from Constantinople have been hung on
the walls of the east hall, next to the rotunda. The collections of
oriental antiquities and religious ceremonials now occupy two alcoves
in the east hall and two in the west hall of the Museum building.

That portion of the historical collection which is on exhibition is in
good condition, but there is still considerable work to be done in the
way of labeling the specimens. Several pieces of apparatus used by
Professor Henry in connection with his researches in electro-magnetism,
which have for many years been in the custody of the Smithsonian
Institution, were placed upon exhibition in the Museum during this
year, together with other pieces of apparatus deposited by Miss Mary
A. Henry. <A special case is devoted to this apparatus. A rearrange.
ment of the specimens in the boat hall is contemplated. On account
of the limited space available for exhibition purposes, the collections
illustrating the various stages in the development of the sewing machine
and the typewriter have been placed in storage.

The exhibition series of the department of paleontology in the south-
east court has been rearranged, and the court again opened to the
public. The former crowded condition of the room has been relieved,
to some extent, by the removal of a portion of the slope-top cases.
Thirty-two of these cases still remain, and in these is installed the col-
lection of invertebrate fossils. The fossil plants and vertebrates are
arranged in the wall cases. A few additional vertebrate fossils have
been placed upon exhibition during the year, and a number of large
casts secured to the walls or placed upon the tops of the wall cases.
The collection of fossil insects occupies one flat-top case, and the large
slabs of tracks have been placed upon screens in the corners of the hall.

The systematic collection of rocks has been entirely rearranged and
the labels of the building-stone collection renewed. Over 200 photo-
graphs were mounted and placed upon exhibition in the department
of geology. Owing to lack of space, the permanent increase in the
exhibition series in this department has been small. Better specimens
are, however, being constantly substituted for less desirable ones.
The mineral collection is being supplied as rapidly as possible with
individual and group labels. The cases have been numbered and an
‘arrangement label” has been prepared and put up, Showing the scheme
of arrangement of the collections. An educational series is in course
of preparation.

The exhibition hall of the department of mammals has been entirely

NAT MUS 95 33

34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

rearranged and rendered more attractive. In carrying out the new
arrangement the position of all of the movable cases was changed.
The appearance of that portion of the collection installed in the wall
cases is seriously diminished by the fact that the mounted specimens
are so close together that the light is obstructed, and in many cases
little more than the heads and shoulders of the specimens can be seen.
The Audubon lithographic pictures of mammals, recently purchased
by the Museum have been hung in the office of the curator, tempo-
rarily. The series of interlocked antlers has been transferred to the
department of comparative anatomy to be incorporated in the osteo-
logical collection. Labels have been made for the porpoises arranged
on top of the wall cases in the south hall. In the department of birds
the exhibition series is in good condition. A limited number of badly
mounted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens not
suitable for exhibition have been replaced by better ones. Several
months were spent in renovating the entire mounted collection, each
specimen being subjected to a process of cleaning, which, it is believed,
will-result in a material improvement in the appearance of the collec-
tion. A few specimens have been added to the exhibition series in the
department of comparative anatomy during the year, and the entire
exhibit is in good condition. The exhibition space in this department
has been increased to a limited extent by placing cases between the
piers above the wall cases. In the department of fishes the condition
of the exhibition series remains the same as last year. In the depart-
ment of marine invertebrates five old-fashioned flat ebony cases have
been replaced by mahogany eases, and the location of some of the
other cases has been changed. The collection of tree snails from the
Philippine Islands has been placed upon exhibition in the department
of mollusks.

The exhibition series in the department of ethnology is embraced in
two groups—the material actually on exhibition and the exhibition
series returned from the World’s Columbian Exposition. Owing to
lack of room, the latter has been temporarily placed in storage. The
work of setting up in the northwest court a special exhibit illustrating
the ethnology of the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona has been
carried on during the year. The change referred to last year in the
arrangement of the exhibition hall of the department of prehistoric
anthropology has been completed. All of the objects, contained in fifty-
two cases, have been rearranged geographically by States and foreign
countries. Twelve cases, containing objects made by or belonging to
prehistoric man, have also been rearranged. In the wall cases on the
north and west sides of the hall the objects from Mexico, the West
Indies, and Central and South America have been installed. The
Pacific Coast objects have been segregated and installed in a case by
themselves, and the mummies are now exhibited in the wall ease on the
south side of the hall. Two additional shelves have been provided in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

each alcove case, and about 900 specimens of mound pottery placed
thereon. Large cases of pottery from Peru, Brazil, and the Arkansas
mounds have been placed in the foyer of the hall. A case containing
a group of Indian figures, and representing a quarry workshop, has
also been installed. A large number of paintings, drawings, litho-
graphs, and photographs of prehistoric objects have been hung on the
walls of the hall; also a map showing the linguistic stocks of North
America, and a chronological map showing the distribution of aborigi-
nal mound districts in the United States. Many additional labels have
been provided for the specimens in the cases,

LABELS.

During the year there were printed 1,870 forms of labels, including
171,544 copies. Of this number 242 forms, representing 82,568 labels,
were printed at the Museum. There were also printed on the Museum
press 57,466 envelopes, copies of blanks, ete., representing 28 forms,
and at the Government Printing Office 558,100 copies, representing 29
forms.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library during the past year have exceeded
those of any previous year since its organization. Dr. Cyrus Adler,
librarian, states that there were received by gift, purchase, and
exchange 1,035 volumes, 2,255 parts of volumes, and 3,311 pamphlets,
making a total of 6,601. This is an increase of more than 2,200 over
the receipts for the year ending June 30, 1894. A complete list of the
accessions by gift and exchange is printed in Appendix tt. There
were retained for the use of the Museum from the accessions to the
library of the Smithsonian Institution 133 books, 619 pamphlets, and
7,451 parts of periodicals. About 1,600 books were bound during the
year, two-thirds of this number belonging to the Museum and the
remainder to the Smithsonian deposit.

The number of books borrowed was 6,110. A large number of books
in the custody of the sectional libraries, which would have been recalled
earlier but for the overcrowded condition of the library, have now been
gathered in. This makes the number of books returned exceed by
about 3,000 the number of books lent during the year.

Extensive additions have been made to the series of publications of
museums, of State agricultural colleges and experiment stations, scien-
tific publications of the United States Government, and publications
relating to early travel in North America. Tor the purpose of accom-
modating these publications, and to relieve to some extent the crowded
condition of the library, a set of bookshelves has been constructed at
the west end of the lecture hall.

The librarian states that the Museum is under obligations to the
Library of Congress for the same hearty cooperation which has been
manifested in the past.
36

The library has been freely consulted by members of the Museum
staff, by officials connected with several of the other scientific bureaus
of the Government, by members of the various scientific societies of
Washington, and by other specialists not connected with the Museum.

A large amount of time has been devoted to a new classification of
the books and pamphlets. This work was nearly completed at the
close of the fiscal year, notwithstanding the large increase of work in
matters of routine. The transfer of the catalogue to cards of the
standard library form was commenced in the early part of the year.
Up to the present time about 4,500 cards belonging to this catalogue
have been filled out.

There are now 21 sectional libraries.

PUBLICATIONS.

The bill relating to the printing, binding, and distribution of public
documents approved January 12, 1895, authorizes the printing of
10,000 copies of the Smithsonian Report (of which Part I is the vol-
ume devoted to the operations of the National Museum), 1,000 of
which shall be for the use of the Senate, 2,000 for the House of Repre-
sentatives, 5,000 for distribution by the Smithsonian Institution, and
2,000 for the National Museum. The quota allotted to the Museum is
quite insufficient to supply even the large public and scientific libraries
throughout the world, not to mention the various departmental and
bureau libraries of the Government, consular officers, collaborators,
and contributors to the collections in the Museum, and the numerous
applications from individuals and institutions not on the mailing lists.
The Smithsonian Institution has, however, kindly placed at the dis-
posal of the Museum a portion of its allotment, thus making possible a
more satisfactory distribution than could otherwise have been eftected.

Requisitions for printing Volume xvit of Proceedings and Bulletin
48 have been sent to the Printing Office.

The Museum Report for 1892, constituting Part 11 of the Report of
the Smithsonian Institution, was published during the year. The sepa-
rate papers in the appendix to the Report were issued in pamphlet form
before the close of the last year. The volume for 1893 is now going
through the press, and its receipt from the printer at an early date is
expected. The separate papers (Nos. 976-1032) in Volume Xvit of
Proceedings have, with one exception, been distributed. The bound
volume will soon be ready for distribution. Advance sheets of a paper
by M. L. Linell, describing a new species of Golden Beetle from Costa
Rica, and a note on two new species of beetles of the Tenebrionid genus
Echocerus, by F. H. Chittenden, were published, in order to secure pri-
ority of descripticn to the authors. The papers will be reprinted as
Nos. 1040 and 1041 in Volume xvitt of the Proceedings. The titles of
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

all papers distributed in separate form during the year will be found in
Appendix vy. Manuscripts of 35 papers to be included in Volume XVIIE
have been forwarded to the Printing Office. These include 14 papers
relating to fishes, 9 relating to birds, 4 relating to mollusks, and 8 papers
on other subjects.

3ulletin No. 48, ‘Contribution toward a Monograph of the Insects
of the Lepidopterous Family Noctuidie of Boreal North America;
A Revision of the Deltoid Moths,” by John B. Smith, has been pub-
lished. The tollowing additional parts of Bulletin No. 39 are now in
the folding room: Part H, “ Directions for collecting minerals,” by Wirt
Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Directions for collecting rocks and for the preparation
of thin sections,” by George P. Merrill; Part J, ‘‘ Directions for col-
lecting specimens and information illustrating the aboriginal uses of
plants,” by Frederick V. Coville; Part K, ‘Directions for collecting
and preparing fossils,” by Charles Schuchert. An extra edition of
Part A, “Directions for collecting birds,” by Robert Ridgway, has
been printed at the expense of the Museum allotment, to supply the
extraordinary demand for this pamphlet. Considerable progress has
been made with Bulletin 47, “The Fishes of North and Middle Amer-
ica,” by David Starr Jordan and Barton W. Evermann, and the volume
will doubtless be ready for distribution during the next fiscal year.
The manuscript for the second volume of the work is now in prepara-
tion. The bulletin will be accompanied by an atlas of plates.

The second of the series of Special Bulletins in quarto form, entitled
“Oceanic Ichthyology,” relating to the deep-sea and pelagic fishes of
the world, by G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, the preparation
of which was noticed in the Report for last year, has been set in type,
and will shortly go to press. The preparation of the third of the series
of Special Bulletins, being the second volume of “ Life Histories of
North American Birds,” by Charles E. Bendire, has rapidly progressed,
and the bulletin is already partially in type. This, as well as the
preceding, will also be published in the Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

Four circulars have been issued by the Museum during the year,
Nos. 43 to 45, requesting the transmission of publications of scientific
bodies and educational establishments to the Museum library and
inviting the contribution of authors’ separates and reprints, and No.
46, soliciting the cooperation of students and collectors in forwarding

4? REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

WORK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM.

A number of persons have availed themselves of the privilege of
examining Museum material in the offices and laboratories of the cura.
tors. These include students, specialists from various parts of the
country who had come to Washington for the purpose of consulting the
collections, and officers of several of the scientific bureaus of the Gov-
ernment.

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., spent considerable time in the depart-
ment of mammals studying the large collection from the Mexican
boundary which he had been foremost in gathering in connection with
his work on the survey. Many specimens were also sent to him at Fort
Myer, Va., for examination and comparison. He has in view the pub-
lication of an extensive report on the geographical distribution and
relationships of the various forms inhabiting the southern border of
the United States. The officers of the Division of Ornithology and
Mammalogy of the Department of Agriculture have had free access to
the mammal collections.

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Leland Stanford Junior University, visited
the Museum during the summer of 1894, for the purpose of studying
the methods of taxidermy employed here.

The committee on classification and nomenclature of the American
Ornithologists’ Union held its sessions in the office of the curator of the
department of birds, and made daily use of the study series, thereby
deciding numerous questions of importance in connection with the
Union’s “Check List of North American Birds.” Mr. Charles B. Cory, of
Boston, Mass., consulted the collections in connection with the identifi-
cation of species of Hlainea from San Domingo. Mr. William Brewster
brought to the Museum a number of specimens of North American and
Mexican birds, whose correct determination necessitated a comparison
with types and other specimens in the Museum. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of
the Department of Agriculture, examined specimens on various ocea-
sions, mainly in connection with his work at the Department. Maj.
Charles E. Bendire, honorary curator of the department of oology in
the Museum, frequently consulted the collections of birds in connection
with the identification of specimens, and also to aid him in fixng the
geographical range of species included in the second volume of his *‘ Life
Histories of North American Birds.” Mr. Henry ©. Oberholser, of the
Department of Agriculture, has almost daily consulted the study series
in connection with special investigations which he is conducting, and
also with a view to obtaining a more detailed knowledge of the North
Americal species and subspecies of birds. Mr. R. P. Currie has made
similar use of the collections. Mr. E. E. Armstrong did considerable
volunteer work in the department of birds, at the same time improving
the opportunity to study the collections.

Dr. G, Baur, of the University of Chicago, who was engaged for a time
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a

in the study of the Testudinata, and Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia,
were given facilities for study in the laboratory of the department of
reptiles, in connection with the preparation of his forthcoming work on
“The Snakes and Lizards of North America,” which will be published
as a bulletin of the Museum.

Prof. C. W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Phila-

delphia, visited the Museum several times to consult the collection of
Stratyomyide, and Prof. Lawrence Bruner, of Lincoln, Nebr., con-
sulted the collections of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera for the pur-
pose of identifying western species. Mr. Ellison A. Smith, professor
of biology at the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Blacks-
burg, Va., consulted the collection in connection with the identification
of exotic butterflies, and Prof. J. B. Smith, of New Brunswick, N. J.,
visited the Museum for the purpose of examining material in connec-
tion with his monographic work on the Noctuids. Mr. C. H. Roberts
and Mr. Aug. Merkel, of New York City, and Capt. Henry John Elwes,
president of the Entomological Society of London, also consulted the
collections in the department of insects.
. During the present year, as heretofore, Dr. Theodore Gill made use
of the collections of fishes in connection with his studies of families
and genera. Mr. Barton W. Evermann compared specimens in the
collection with material obtained by field parties of the U.S. Fish Com-
mission. -

During the summer of 1894, Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the State Uni-
versity of Lowa, spent several weeks in the laboratory of the department
of marine invertebrates studying the large collection of Hydroids, espe-
cially the West Indian forms. Dr. R. P. Bigelow spent a few days at
the Museum in revising his report on the Stomatopoda. Prof. A. E.
Verrill has continued his studies at New Haven of the Fish Commission
material from the Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras, and especially
of the echinoderms.

Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department
of Agriculture, has made use of the Museum collections in connection
with his studies of scientific and economic helminthology.

In the department of mollusks, Prof. William B. Clark, of Johns Hop-
kins University, studied the Tertiary fauna of Maryland; Mr. Charles
W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Philadelphia,
studied the Tertiary fauna of North Carolina, and Mr. T. Wayland
Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey, spent some time in the study
and examination of the Eocene corals.

During the year Mr. J. D. McGuire, of Ellicott City, Md., continued
his studies of the art of stone working. Mr. Stewart Culin, of the
University of Pennsylvania, spent considerable time in the department
of ethnology in the study of games and gambling devices, with a view
to comparing them with the series in the Museum of Archeology and
Paleontology at the university. Dr. Franz Boas prosecuted an extended
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

study of the ethnology of the Indians of the Northwest Coast, spend-
ing a great deal of time in arranging and labeling specimens. The
results of this study and of his visit to the Northwest Coast in 1895 are
embodied in a paper on the ‘Social Organization and the Secret Societies
of the Kwakiutl Indians,” published in this volume. Dr. W.J. Hoffman,
of the Bureau of Ethnology, was also engaged for a considerable time
in the prosecution of investigations in the department of ethnology. A
paper by him on “The Graphic Arts of the Eskimo” appears in Part II
of this volume.

Prof. J. M. Coulter, of Lake Forest University, spent about ten days
in the herbarium during February and March in the study of Mexican
Umbellifere. Dr. B. L. Robinson was occupied about a week in the
study of the Ranunculacez and neighboring families. Prof. Edward
L. Greene, of Berkeley, Cal., spent several days in making critical
observations of Western species. Dr. Marcus E. Jones, of Salt Lake
City, determined a large collection of plants, giving about four or five
months to the work. Mr. John B. Leiberg, of Hope, Idaho, was in
Washington for several weeks studying the plants of eastern Oregon;
and Mr. P. A. Rydberg, of Lincoln, Nebr., spent two months in the
completion of a report on a collection of plants which he obtained in
the Black Hills in 1892.

MATERIAL RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT.

It has always been the policy of the Museum to examine, free of
charge, specimens transmitted to the Museum for determination, no
matter by whom or from what locality. This privilege has been
appreciated, as is shown by the large number of packages arriving daily
with requests for identification. In this way the special knowledge of
the curators is freely placed at the disposal of anyone who chooses
to seek it. Since the Museum building was opened in i881, not less
than 6,000 persons have taken advantage of this privilege, and nota
day passes without receiving similar requests. In the case of geolog-
ical material, qualitative determinations only can be made, as the
Museum has not facilities for making extended chemical analyses for
the public. Its small and insufficiently equipped laboratory is barely
sufficient for the analytical work which is absolutely necessary in con-
nection with the current operations of the geological departments.

In addition to requests under this head, numerous requests for tech-
nical information, unaccompanied by specimens for determination, are
constantly received, and these two classes of requests alone necessitate
a large amount of correspondence.

During the year material from all parts of the United States, as well
as from British America, West Indies, Mexico, Central America, South
America, several countries in Europe, and from Asia and Oceanica,
was transmitted to the Museum for examination and report. It is very
seldom that any of this material is desired for the collections, and expe-
rience has proved that material of a character likely to be wanted, is
usually transmitted with a request for its return. When any of these
AG REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

sendings are retained, their addition to the permanent collections is
recorded by means of a double number, as may be seen in Appendix
vi. The first number is that which is given to the material on the
“examination and report” record; the latter, the number on the per-
manent accession record. During the year 467 lots (Nos. 2769-3235,
inclusive) have been received. Reports prepared by the curators or
their assistants have been forwarded to the senders.

A detailed list, arranged alphabetically by names, is given in Ap-
pendix VI.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTON DURING THE YEAR.

The American Historical Association held its tenth annual meeting in
Washington on December 26-28, 1894. The lecture hall of the Museum
was used for the morning sessions. !

On January 3, 1895, the National Science Club held a meeting in the
lecture hall.!

The regular April meeting of the National Academy of Sciences
was, as usual, held in the Museum building. The lecture hall was
used for the public meetings and one of the offices for the business
meetings. The titles of the papers entered to be read at this meeting
are given in Appendix VI.

On February 25, 18838, a joint commission of the Anthropological,
Biological, Chemical, Geographic, and Philosophical societies was
formed, the Entomological and Geological societies being admitted a
short time afterwards. The necessity for more complete cooperation
among these societies had been manifest for some time, and many
of the prominent members used their influence to bring about such
a result. It was felt that one feature of the work, especially, could
be carried on to greater advantage—that of providing for suitable
courses of popular lectures. Accordingly, on January 25, 1895, the
following constitution was drafted, and afterwards adopted by the sev-
eral societies:

I. The joint commission shall be composed of the officers and administrative
boards of the several component societies.

II. The commission shall have power (a) to provide for meetings of the societies ;
(b) to conduct courses of popular lectures; (c) to prepare a joint directory of the
members of the societies; (d) to distribute to all members of the societies periodic
advance notices of the meetings of the several societies; (e) to act in the interest of
the component societies at the instance of any of them.

III. The expense thus incurred shall be borne by the several societies in the ratio
of their membership.

The joint commission was organized on February 20 with Mr.
Gardiner G. Hubbard as president and Dr. G. Brown Goode as vice-
president.

Although the Saturday lectures at the Museum for the season of

‘A list of the papers submitted is printed in Appendix vu.

Geological societies, fnture courses will doubtless embrace the work of
other sections as well. The subjects of the lectures for this year will
be found in Appendix VII.

COTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT ATLANTA, GA.

By the act of Congress, approved August 8, 1894, provision was made
for a Government exhibit at the Cotton States and International Expo-
sition to be held at Atlanta from September 18 to December 31, 1895.
The sum of $150,000 was appropriated, with the addition of $50,000 for
the erection of a building, Dr.Charles W. Dabney, jr., was made chair-
man of the Government board of management. The sum of 822,000
was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum,
of which $16,500 is available for the preparation of exhibits. At the
close of the fiscal year this work was well under way, exhibits being
in course of preparation in the following departments: Mammals, birds,
marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, reptiles, fishes, mollusks,
insects, paleontology, minerals, geology, botany, ethnology, and pre-
historic anthropology. The technological collections were also repre-
sented, as well as the sections of materia medica, oriental antiquities
and religious ceremonials.

An extended account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in this Exposition, including a description of the exhibits to be pre-
pared by the National Museum, will be published in the Report of the
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896. Not only the
Museum, but all the other dependencies of the Institution, will prepare
exhibits, viz, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-

physical Observatory. The exhibit being prepared by the Bureau of
Ethnology will include a number of life-size models of Papago and
Seri Indians, together with a series of weapons, household utensils,
and articles of personal adornment used by these tribes. A collection
of similar articles used by the Cherokees will also be shown. The
Bureau of International Exchanges will send one of the fifty sets of
Government documents which are annually transmitted by the Bureau
to institutions abroad, and will exhibit a map showing the geograph-
ical distribution of the correspondents of the Institution. The Zoolog-
ical Park will be represented by a series of views of various objects of
interest within its borders, and the Astrophysical Observatory will
send a number of photographs of the special apparatus employed in
connection with the investigations which are being conducted in that
establishment. The Institution proper will exhibit, among other things,
a complete set of its publications, comprising about two hundred
volumes.
III.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC
DEPARTMENTS.

The statements which appear under this heading are for the most
part gathered from the annual reports of the curators. Commencing
with the year 1893, these have been submitted in the form of answers to
a series of questions. This form of report has, after much considera-
tion, been adopted, for the present at any rate, as preferable to the
former plan, the chief objection to which was that the information sup-
plied in the reports did not always present a complete and homoge-
neous statement of the werk accomplished. This made it difficult to
comprehend at a glance how much work had been accomplished in any
special direction, and often resulted in the introduction of a large
amount of material into the volume which did not have a direct bear-
ing on the work of the curator as custodian of a collection, and, there-
fore, although perfectly admissible in an extended essay, with the
work of the department as its basis, was not, at times, altogether
within the scope of an administrative document.

In reviewing the work of the scientific departments in the Museum
during the year which ended on June 30, 1895, the fact must be remem-
bered that considerable time and labor have been necessarily expended
in the preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition, which opens
on September 18. Exhibits for this occasion are being prepared by
every department in the Museum, and a statement of what has been
done in this direction by each department will be presented in the
report for 1896, that being the fiscal year in which the Exposition is to
be held. An account of these exhibits, it may be added, is now being
prepared in the form of a pamphlet, to be distributed at Atlanta during
the continuance of the Exposition.

Experience has proved that the regular work of the Museum always
suffers to a very considerable extent during the years when expositions
in which the Museum is directed to participate, are held. Nor ean it
be otherwise, since the features which it is especially desirable to
emphasize in special exhibits of this kind are not, as a rule, such as
would ordinarily be made conspicuous in the natural development of
the Museum exhibition series. Again, it is noticeable that in exposi-
tion years the number of papers published by the curators, as the result
of their studies of the enllections under their care, is much smaller

than in other years. This is readily accounted for by the fact that the

lime which would otherwise be given to study is consumed in the spe-
cial work of the exposition, and unfortunately the outcome of this work
does not as a rule redound to the full benefit of the Museum after the
exposition is over. This subject has been already dwelt upon in previous:
reports, and while the Museum is always ready to make every effort
to provide a creditable display at expositions, it can not be said that,
taking everything into consideration, the Museum is much the gainer,
It is true that special appropriations are generally made to enable the
Museum to participate, but these are so inadequate that not only is the
result usually unsatisfactory to the Museum authorities, but also the
Specimens purchased are not always such as can be assimilated with
the permanent Museum exhibits after their return to Washington.

Notwithstanding these obstacles, very excellent headway has been
made in strictly Museum work in many of the departments, as will be
seen in the following account of what has been accomplished.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS,

By far the most important collection received during the year was
that sent in by Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has collected during the year in
Eastern Turkestan, on the border of the Pamir, and in Kashmir. He
presented a collection of 107 specimens, including several fine speci-
mens of Himalayan ibex, Polo’s sheep, Asiatic gazelle, stag, etc.,
together with good series of marmots, pikas, mice, and other small
forms. Mr. William Astor Chanler presented the type of Chanler’s
Reed Buck (Cervicapra Chanleri). From Mr. H.C. Moore were received
40 mammals from South Africa, including several antelopes. This eol-
lection will serve an excellent purpose in filling existing vacancies in the
exhibition series. A collection of West African species, though mostly
in the form of pelts, was received from Mr. J. H. Camp. It included
two specimens of the very rare Golden Mole (Chrysochloris leucorhina).

The collection has received numerous additions from the National
Zoological Park, in accordance with the general understanding that
animals dying in confinement shall be turned over to the National
Museum, the skins and skulls coming to this department and the
skeletons being transferred to the department of comparative anatomy.
Several interesting animals, obtained by the Fish Commission, were
also added to the collection. From the Government exhibits of Costa

tica, Ceylon, Korea, and Johore at the World’s Columbian Exposition,
specimens of mammals were acquired at the close of the Exposition,
although they were not recorded on the catalogue of the department
until during the fiseal year covered by this report. The number of
individuals contributing material to this department during the year
was 56, The collections of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, made during his con-
nection with the Mexican Boundary Commission, included 708 specimens
of mammals. This gift contained material of much scientific value, the
specimens having been prepared and labeled with the greatest care.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1

as

The fact that his collections represented the results of continuous
exploration along a line of several hundreds of miles, also adds con.
siderably to their value.

The rearrangement of the exhibition series of mammals during the
year occupied the attention of the curator, Mr. F. W. True, for several
weeks. He thus describes the details incident to this work:

In the fall of 1894 a complete rearrangement of the cases in the exhibition hall
waseffected, agreeably with instructions from the Assistant Secretary. The position
of all the movable cases was changed, with the object of making a better balaneed
arrangement and one more attravtive, also to break up the continuous vista pre-
viously maintained in the center of the hall. It was found necessary thereafter to
raise the large cast of a humpback whale, which was done. The series of inter-
locked antlers was transferred to the osteological hall. Several groups for which no
place could be found were packed and stored. Large labels were made for the series
of porpoise casts arranged on top of the wall cases. The Audubon lithographic
pictures of mammals which were purchased and framed by the Museum some time
ago, were hung in the office of the curator until a more suitable place could be found
for them. The cetacean molds were all overhauled and a detailed list made of them
for reference. The taxidermists mounted eight skins, but on account of being called
upon tor other work nothing was completed. A large amount of work was done
upon the alcoholic study series in the way of cataloguing, arranging, rebottling,
etc. The Mearns collection was gone over, a concordance of collector’s and Museum
numbers made, and other necessary work performed. All new accessions were cata-
logued and put in cases. A large number of skins from tho taxidermists’ vats were
labeled and put in their proper places.

The work of the taxidermist is referred to more in detail elsewhere.

The present condition of the collections, so far as the preservation
of the material contained in them is concerned, is better than at any
previous time, as is shown in the following extract from Mr. True’s
report:

The exhibition series is in good condition, but the space and cases in which to
exhibit it are entirely inadequate. This applies especially to the large mammals.
The wall cases are so full that only the heads and necks of the deer, antelope, ete.,
ean be seen. The floor cases are so much crowded that light is obstructed, and the
attractiveness of the collection is much diminished. There are numerous antelopes,
deer, seals, etc., in the taxidermists’ vats, which, when mounted, can be exhibited
only with much difficulty and under unfavorable conditions.

As regards the study series, more storage cases are needed for the large skins.
The alcoholics will need a great deal more labor spent upon them.

As pointed out last year, the large skulls of horned mammals are in need of better
installation. A plan was submitted for that purpose, but was not acted upon. The
great series of small skulls, as stated last year, is in a very unsatisfactory condition
as regards installation. Some 1,500 boxes were purchased for these skulls during the
year, but it was not possible to get the skulls transferred into them.

The card catalogue of skins and alcoholics needs revision. This is an important
matter, but can not be taken up and brought to a finish in the midst of constant
interruption. An incomplete catalogue of this kind is of practically no value.

Besides the necessary administrative work accomplished in connec-
tion with the care of the incoming material and the installation of the
specimens most suitable for exhibition, Mr. True has made special stud-
ies in certain directions. These have resulted in the preparation ot a
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

paper on the occurrence of armadillos of the genus Venurus in Central
America. He has nearly completed a comprehensive paper on the
‘Antlers of the Deer Family.” This will be published as one of the
accompanying papers in the next Report. Work has also been con-
tinued ona monograph of the American moles, in connection with which
the preparation of a series of osteological drawings was found neces-
sary. Mr. True has published four papers during the year—two in
“Science” and two in the “ Proceedings of the National Museum.” The
titles are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). A new species was
described in the paper on the “Rodents of the genus Sminthus in
Kashmir,” under the name of Sminthus flavus.

In May, 1895, Mr. True was temporarily attached to the staff of the
U.S. Fish Commission, at the request of the Acting Commissioner, for
the purpose of making a special study of the seal rookeries.

Owing to the limited appropriations made by Congress for the main-
tenance of the Museum, very little can be done in the way of explorations
under the direct auspices of the Museum. Assistance was rendered to
Dr. Mearns in his work connected with the survey of the Mexican
Boundary, by supplying him with collecting material. An expedition
to Lake Okeechobee, Florida, by Mr. Ridgway and Mr. William Palmer,
resulted in obtaining a small number of mammals, chiefly forms not
well represented in the collections. It is most fortunate for the Museum
that the friendly and valuable assistance of Dr. W. L. Abbott, which
has been so often manifested in his generous gifts, has been con-
tinued this year. As already stated, a very important accession has
recently been received from him as the result of his explorations in
Turkestan and Kashmir. The expedition of Mr. William Astor Chanler
and Lieutenant von Hohnel in the Tana River region, Kast Africa, has
yielded an important contribution to the Museum collection of mam-
mals. Reference should also be made to the collections of Mr. J. D.
Figgins in Maryland, and of Mr. J. H. Camp in the Congo region,
West Africa. The thanks of the Museum are further due to Mr.
Charles H. Townsend, naturalist of the Fish Commission, for his zeal
in obtaining specimens for the Museum while engaged in collecting
work under the auspices of the United States Fish Commission.

In accordance with established usage, the Museum has lent its mate-
rial freely to scientific investigators for study. In this connection may
be mentioned several transmissions of specimens from this department
to Dr. J. A. Allen and Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum
of Natural History, New York; Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia;
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, for use in his studies of the Mexican Boundary
collection; Mr. 8S. N. Rhoads, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Seiences, and Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., of the Department of Agriculture.
Opportunity to study the collection of mammals in the Museum build-
ing has also been extended to Dr. Mearns and to the members of the
staff in the division of economic ornithology and mammalogy in the
Department of Agriculture.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53

In addition to those already mentioned as having made direct contri-
butions to the collections, the Museum in general, and this department
in particular, has benefited greatly through the friendly cooperation
of Maj. Timothy E. Wilcox, U.S. A., Fort Huachuea, Ariz., who has sent
in many interesting specimens from time to time from the vicinity of
his post; to Dr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Bureau of Education, who
transmitted a skin of Spermophile, and to Prof. I’. A. Ward, Rochester,
N. Y., Prof. William Trelease, of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St.
Louis, and Dr, P. L. Seclater, London, England. The curator states
that many of the officers and employees of the Museum have inter-
ested themselves in obtaining specimens for the collection, no less than
eighteen different persons having rendered such assistance during the
year.

Regarding the plans which the curator has in mind for improving
the collection of mammals, he writes:

What the Museum now needs more than anything else, in my opinion, is a better
representation of exotic mammals. Of about 410 genera usually recognized, we
possess representatives of only 240, leaving 170 genera entirely. unrepresented.
Furthermore, many of the genera now in the collection are represented only by a
single imperfect skin, or a single skeleton. (Of skulls I have taken no notice.) On
very many occasions, in order to become acquainted with the character of a genus
or species, I have been compelled to extract the skull (often imperfect) from the
single specimen in the collection.

The study of mammals has greatly increased of late, and the investigations are
taking a wider range than ever before. In this work the need of specimens of
foreign groups is strongly felt, as if is recognized that work upon American mate-
rial alone is liable to lead to one-sided results. There is no full collection of foreign
mammals in America, and at present our students must limit their researches, or go
abroad to study. In my opinion, the national collection should endeavor to fill this
need.

The number of specimens added to the collection during the year
was 1,484. In the catalogue of skins, skulls, and alcoholics 1,872
entries were made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 60,607,
and in June, 1895, 62,479. Skeietons are considered as anatomical
specimens, and are entered in the catalogue of the department of com-
parative anatomy. In the volume in which are entered the specimens
belonging to the deposit of the Department of Agriculture 6,402 entries
have been made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 65,818, and
in June, 1895, 72,220.

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS.

The curator, Mr. Robert Ridgway, reports the number of accessions
as somewhat in advance of those received in 1894, while the number
of entries in the catalogue has been more than 1,100 in excess of that
year. The scientific value of the accessions of this year is also reported
as greater than of those received in 1894, The curator mentions the
names of thirty establishments and individuals from whom important
additions to the collections have been received. ‘The list is headed with
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the name of Mr. A. Boueard, Isle of Wight, England, who presented
1,666 specimens. These represent a large number of families. Dr. W.
L. Abbott, whose name occurs in connection with accessions in several
of the departments, contributed 258 specimens from Kashmir, Ladak,
and Turkestan. Six accessions, including species obtained in Arizona,
California, and Lower California, were transmitted by Dr. Edgar A.
Mearns, U. S. A., and Mr. F, X. Holzner, in connection with their
work on the Mexican Boundary Survey. In addition, Dr. Mearns also
contributed 310 specimens, representing 106 species, from Fort Clark
and Fort Hancock, Tex. The curator obtained 152 specimens from
Florida, Maryland, and Illinois, and Mr. R.S. Matthews, of the National
Museum, presented 159 specimens of birds from the United States,
Mexico, and Central America. Mr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant
curator of this department, presented 115 specimens from Virginia,
Mexico, Borneo, and other localities. Mr. William Palmer, chief tax-
idermist of the Museum, presented 8 specimens of Hooded Warbler
from Virginia, and also collected 36 specimens from Florida, In addi.
tion to collections received from individuals, mention should be made
of the contribution of 21 specimens from Alaska by the U.S. Fish
Commission, and of 41 specimens from South America, acquired from
the La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina, in exchange.

A series of specimens has been selected with considerable care for a
special exhibit of a popular character. This has been installed on the
first floor of the south tower. In this series it is intended to include
every species likely to be asked for by the casual visitor, or by anyone
making an elementary study of ornithology. It is thought that it will
be of especial interest to the pupils of the public schools. The exhibit
consists of the following series: The more familiar European birds; the
more familiar North American birds; remarkable birds of other parts
of the world; a series illustrating and explaining the confusion of pop-
war names, examples of protective coloring, protective mimicry, ete.,
“Giants and Pygmies,” or the largest and smallest members of certain
groups; a series of eggs, showing a gradual transition in size from the
egg of the extinet -/piornis to that of the smallest humming bird; albi-
nos and other abnormal color varieties and malformations, and a series
of flightless birds, together with those of extraordinary powers of
flight, for comparison. A catalogue will probably be printed, which, by
means of reference numbers and letters, corresponding to the number-
ing on the shelves and cases, will enable the visitor to locate any speci-
men without difficulty. In addition, a label will be provided for each
specimen. it is also proposed to place in the alcove a reading table
and a case containing a few selected works by well-known writers on
ornithology.

Valuable assistance in the preparation of this exhibit has been
received from Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, of Brooklyn, N. Y.

The following paragraphs from the curator’s report will serve to show
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5D

what progress has been made in caring for the collections, and also the
present condition of the exhibition and study series:

The collections have been thoroughly inspected at proper intervals, and fumi-
gated with bisulphide of carbon to destroy any insects which might be present. No
insects have been found, however, and, except in the exhibition cases, few of which
are sufficiently tight to prevent the ingress of insects or to allow of effective fumi-
gation, and in the old Salvin cases in the west basement, there is little danger to be
apprehended in this direction.

Some changes have been made in the mounted collection, as follows: A limited
number of badly mounted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens too
dilapidated for exhibition have been replaced by better ones. The taxidermist has
been engaged for several months past in renovating the entire mounted collection,
subjecting each specimen to a process of cleaning, which, it is hoped, will result in
a material improvement in this part of the collection.

A volunteer assistant, Mr. KE. E. Armstrong, spent over two months in the depart-
ment of birds, in this time lining with sheet cotton the trays (about 850 in number)
contained in the 54 quarter-unit cases in the bird gallery, resulting in a great
improvement to this part of the study series.

The condition of the exhibition series is very good, and improvements and renova-
tions are being made as time permits. The condition of the study series is excellent,
as far as that portion of the collection accommodated in the bird gallery is con-
cerned. The large birds, stored in the west basement, are in course of rearrange-
ment (and have been for several years), this having been proceeded with until the
cases of the new model provided for the purpose became exhausted. The work has
since been continued on sporadically to accommodate temporarily the increase in the
collections.

The work of Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist, is referred to more in
the chapter relating to the work of the Museum preparators.

The curator has completed an elaborate treatise on the Galapagoan
avifauna, and the paper has been submitted for publication. It consists
of some 650 pages of manuscript, accompanied by outline maps illus-
trating the range of all the species known to inhabit the archipelago,
and two plates of outline figures illustrating generic and specific charac-
ters. The text includes observations on the origin of the Galapagoan
avifauna and other matters. It will doubtless prove to be a work of
great value, and is, in the words of the curator, ‘‘in some respects the
most important work that the author has written.”

The avifauna of the island satellites of Madagascar, from the Comoro
group to the Mascarenes, has been somewhat similarly worked up,
though in less detail. The paper embodying the results of this work
is based primarily on Dr. Abbott’s collections from Aldabra, Assump-
tion, Gloriosa, and the Seychelle Islands, but is not quite finished.
Progress has also been made on a comprehensive treatise on the birds
of North and Middle America. This is a work of great magnitude and
importance, and will constitute a valuable addition to the ornithological
literature of the Museum.

The gallery in the Smithsonian building, used by the department of
birds for office purposes, is in many ways unsuited to work requiring
close application. There being no room in either building available for
the use of the curator, he has found it necessary to do a large part of
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

his literary work at home. In view of the difficulties encountered, he
is entitled to great credit for the work which he has been able to
accomplish in addition to the routine duties of the department.

The explorations of Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, Ladak, and Turk-
estan, have, as already intimated, redounded in a large degree to the
benefit of this department. The collecting work accomplished by Dr.
Edgar A. Mearns and Mr. F. X. Holzner, of the Mexican Boundary
Survey, by Mr. Ridgway in Maryland and Florida, and by Mr. William
Palmer in Florida, has resulted in the acquisition of many interesting
specimens.

Several ornithologists have used material belonging to the depart-
ment in connection with their special studies. In some instances the
material was transmitted to their homes, while in others it was studied
in the gallery of the department. The curator gives the names of thirty
persons through whose cooperation the collections have been enriched
during the year.

It is gratifying to remark that the material in this department has
served as a basis for 26 papers published during the year by the
curator, Mr. C. W. Richmond, the assistant curator, and several col-
laborators of the Museum. These are all included in the Bibliography
(Appendix IV).

The total number of specimens received during the year was 5,499.

The entries in the catalogue books aggregate 5,499, as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS’ EGGS.

Maj. Charles Bendire, honorary curator, reports that 2,023 eges and
nests were added to the collection during the year. Their value is pro-
portionately as great as that of the accessions in the previous year,
although far less in number. Several new species and subspecies were
included. Nearly all the accessions to this collection were given to the
Museum, and the records contain the names of 30 donors who have thus
rendered assistance. Only four specimens were acquired by purchase

The most important contributions were made, as in several previous
years, by Dr. William M. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., whose generosity has
elicited the warmest gratitude of the Museum authorities. His con-
tributions this year consisted of 346 sets, including 1,224 eggs (repre
senting 159 species), and 50 nests. This accession contains many rare
and valuable specimens, besides adding nine species and subspecies to
the collection. Among other contributors of valuable accessions were
Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, Pa., who forwarded 38 specimens,
representing 11 species; and Mr. Chase Littlejohn, Redwood City, Cal.,
who presented 20 specimens, representing three species. Collections
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57

were also received from the U.S. Fish Commission and the Department
of Agriculture.

This collection, including both the exhibition and study series, is in
excellent condition, every accession being carefully catalogued, labeled,
and disposed of as soon as it is received.

The curator has devoted most of his time, when not engaged in work
on the accessions, to the preparation of the second volume of ‘ Life His-
tories of North American Birds,” which is now in the hands of the
printer.

The last catalogue entry made in June, 1894, was 27088 and in June,
1895, 27655,

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The material added to the collections during recent years has been of
special value from a scientific standpoint, and the past year has been
no exception. The number of specimens received in 1895 shows a slight
increase over the records of previous years, Nearly 1,100 specimens
were added to the collection, the largest number heretofore received in
any one year being 1,055. This was the total for the year ending
June 30, 1892, when the material from the Death Valley Expedition
was received. By far the most important collection was that sent in
by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., of the International Boundary Com-
mission, which was found upon examination to contain a number of
new species. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of the Department of Agriculture, made
collections in the vicinity of the Mexican boundary, and material of
considerable value was received from him during the year. A small
but interesting collection of reptiles from the Jombené Range, East
Africa, was received from Mr. William Astor Chanler. Several val-
uable collections were transmitted by the U. 8. Fish Commission,
including material obtained by Messrs. Evermann and Hirsch from
the Maumee Basin, and by Mr. C. H. Townsend from the Galapagos
Islands. Dr. William L. Abbott presented material from Turkestan,
and Prof. John Macoun, of Ottawa, sent a collection of Garter snakes
from Canada. <A specimen of Amblyostoma annulatum, of which only
one example had previously been taken, was purchased from Messrs.
H. H. and C. S. Brimley, of Raleigh, N.C. A few specimens of rare
New Mexican snakes were also purchased.

In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned,
reference should. be made to the contributions of Prof. T. D, A. Cock-
erell, of Las Cruces, N. Mex., who transmitted a number of specimens
of reptiles; Mr. Hubert Brown, of Tucson, Ariz., who sent in several
specimens of tizards; Mr. Henry G. Hubbard, of Washington, D. C.,
who collected specimens of Rana cwsopus in Florida; Mr, H. Candlin, of
Kerrville, Tex., who sent specimens of snakes from that region, and
Dr. O. Boettger, Frank fort-on-the-Main, Germany, who transmitted in
a8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

exchange two specimens of Chinese lizards, desired for purposes of
comparison.

During the fall of 1894 the curator made a trip to the Bad Lands of
South Dakota, where he obtained a number of interesting specimens,
Mr. William Palmer, of the National Museum, also made collections
during his visit to Florida, in the spring of 1895.

Experiments have been made with formalin as a preservative, with a
view to using it as a substitute for alcohol, but, while it has been found
to possess advantages over the latter for use in the field, it is doubtful
whether it will ever take the place of alcohol in the preservation of
permanent museum collections.

During the year the entire collection was overhauled, and the alcohol
renewed. The exotic species in the study series have been rearranged.
Owing to lack of space, no attempt has been made to increase the
exhibition series.

As mentioned elsewhere in this report, material has been lent to
specialists for study on several occasions during the year, and to Prof.
E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, were given special facilities for study in
the laboratory of the department.

Dr. Stejneger has commenced the preparation of reports upon the
reptiles of the Mexican Boundary, and upon the collections made by
Dr. Fisher in the Huachuca Mountains. He has also continued work on
his proposed manual of Japanese Herpetology. Several papers based
upon Museum material have been published by the curator during the
year, two of them containing descriptions of new species. All of the
papers are referred to in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The last entry in the catalogue for the fiscal year covered by this
report was 22,482, the last entry for the preceding year having been
21,385, a total of 1,094 entries.

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean still remains honorary curator of this depart-
ment, although since his change of residence to New York Mr. Barton
A, Bean, assistant curator, has practically performed the duties of
curator. In his report he states that, although the accessions of the
year were not so numerous or important as in 1894, much valuable
material has been received. The most important accessions were a
collection of fishes made at Mazatlan by Dr. David S. Jordan and
others, and presented by the Leland Stanford Junior University; a
collection of fishes made at the Azores by Prof. William Trelease,
director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis; a series of deep-
water fishes from the Indian Museum, Caleutta, collected by H. M.S.
Investigator in the Bay of Bengal. The U.S. Fish Commission trans- -
ferred to the Museum types of fourteen new species of fishes collected
in Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, lowa, and Lake Ontario; also collections
of fishes from Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Columbia River
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

Basin. In ali, upward of 6,000 specimens were added to the collee-
tion during the year.

Old and recent collections of Japanese and Chinese fishes, not in-
stalled with the general collections, as well as collections made by the
Albatross and from other sources, in the West Indies and around the
coasts of Florida, have been given a temporary place in the basement
storage rooms. Duplicates from the deep-sea collections have been
provided with metal tags and numbered, the species being separated
in jars systematically arranged. Several large collections have been
catalogued, including some resulting from the dredgings of the Alba-
tross in the Pacific Ocean, and received during the previous year.
Perhaps the most important work has been the selection and arrange-
ment of the deep-sea material with a view to the preparation of the
duplicates into sets for distribution to educational establishments. By
this process of elimination the study series is now in a much more sat-
isfactory condition. This series has also been improved by the acces-
sion of new and well-preserved material, including a number of types
of new and rare forms.

No special change has been effected in the exhibition series, which
consists of five cases of casts of fishes, exhibited in the west hall of
the Smithsonian building, and a large number of casts placed on the
tops of cases containing corals, besides two cases of alcoholic speci-
mens preserved in rectangular jars.

Mr. Bean has prepared a list of the European fishes in the collec-
tions, and a list of the types of fishes preserved in the collections is
now receiving his attention. Dr. Theodore Gill has examined a num-
ber of European fishes. Work upon the deep-sea fishes has been con-
tinued by the Assistant Secretary and Dr. Bean, in connection with the
preparation of Special Bulletin No. 2, “Oceanic Ichthyology.” The
assistant curator and Mr. B. W. Evermann, of the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion, have in preparation a bibliographical list of the fishes recorded
from the fresh waters of North America north of the United States.

Accessions of fishes resulted from the work of field parties of the
Department of Agriculture in the Death Valley and in Mexico, the
United States and Mexican Boundary Survey in California, and the ex-
plorations of Messrs. Scovell and Woolman in Mexicoin 1891. In addi-
tion, collections were nade in Lake Ontario and the St, Lawrence
River during July and August, 1894; also in Lake Champlain and in
various streams of northeastern New York, by Messrs. Evermaun,
B. A. Bean, and others, under the auspices of the U.S, Fish Commission.
These will be added to the Museum collections after examination.

Material from this department has been lent to several specialists to
aid them in their researches, and four collaborators of the Museum
have studied the collections in the building.

Twelve papers, based wholly or in part on the collections, have been
published during the year. The authors were Dr. G. Brown Goode,
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. T. H.Bean, Mr. Barton A. Bean, Mr. Charles H. Beeson, Mr. Carl H.,
Kigenmann, and Dr. Theodore Gill. Two new families, 11 new genera,
and 9 new species were described in these papers.

Upward of 6,000 specimens were received during the year. The last
catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 45451, and in June, 1895, 47504,

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING GCENOZOIC FOSSILS).

The year 1894-95 has undoubtedly been one of the foremost in the
accomplishment of work in this department. During the absence of
the curator, Dr. William H. Dall, in Alaska, Mr. Charles T. Simpson,
assistant, assumed charge of the work. Dr. R. EK. C. Stearns, who has
labored so faithfully for many years in this department, still serves
in an honorary capacity as associate curator, although he has left
Washington to reside in Los Angeles, California.

The number of accessions received during the year was 111, the same
as in 1894. They are, for the most part, smaller in extent, although
some of them are reported by Dr. Dall as being quite valuable. The
most important contributions, as in many previous years, were made
by Rey. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, to whom the warmest thanks of the
Museum are due for so many valuable additions to the collections.
Among his gifts to the Museum this year was a specimen of Pleuro-
tomaria beyrichi, Hilg., from Japan. Series of land, fresh-water, and
marine shells from the Philippine Islands were secured from Hamline
University, through Prof. H. L. Osborn, in return for naming the large
collection belonging to the university. In a similar way series of Ano-
dontas and Unios from Canada and British America were obtained
from the Geological Survey of Canada, through Prof. J. Ff. Whiteaves.
This material is extremely valuable in furnishing evidence of geograph-
ical distribution, on account of the accurate record of the localities from
which it was derived. Dr. H. von Ihering also transmitted Unionide
and other fresh-water shells from Central and South America, in return
for aid in naming his material. Mr. W. W. Herman presented several
species of Japanese marine shells, in return for similar services. Mr.
W.B. K. Johnson contributed land and fresh-water shells from the Isle
of Pines, Cuba. The Young Naturalists’ Society, of Seattle, Wash.,
gave a series of Verebratula transversa and other shells from Puget
Sound. The California Academy of Sciences, through Dr. J.G. Cooper,
gave a collection of Lower Californian land shells, in return for identi-
fications made for the Academy. An extensive lot of land shells and
other material was collected and transmitted by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,
U.S. A., in connection with his work on the Mexican Boundary Survey.
From the Museum of Natural History in Paris, France, has been
received, in exchange, a set of brachiopods obtained by the Travailleur
at great depths in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The numerous accessions
received from Miss Ida M. Shepard and Mr. T. 8. Oldroyd, in connection
with their investigations of the fauna of San Pedro Bay, California, are
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

very valuable to the collection. ‘The first installments of the mass of
material which was collected by the U.S. Fish Commission and placed
many years ago in the hands of Prof. A.E. Verrill, of Yale College, for
study and identification, have been received. This fact is recorded
with much pleasure and the acknowledgments of the Museum are due to
Professor Verrill for the long and difficult task which the study of this
material has imposed upon him.

The curator thus reports on the work accomplished during the year
in connection with the preservation and installation of the collections:

During the year ending June 30, 1895, about 14,132 specimens, representing about
3,000 species, have been entered upon our record book for the study collection. Most
of these, together with a large amount previously entered, have been regularly incor-
porated in the study series, the general index has been further added to and corrected,
and lists of the species and genera for ready reference have been written and placed
in each tray of the working collection. The entire general collection of Naiads has
been carefully examined and compared with the Lea collection and literature and
accurately named, They have been arranged ina natural system, in groups. At the
present time Mr. Simpson is making out cards showing their distribution.

A considerable part of the fine general marine collection presented by the Rev. Dr.
L. T. Chamberlain has been administered upon, a part of this being added to the
general collection and the remainder being placed among the duplicates.

An extensive collection of aleoholic and dry material which was collected by the
U. S. Fish Commission off the coast of New England has recently been received
from Prof. A. E. Verrilil, who has held the same for study and naming. The alco-
holies have been carefully examined and the alcohol made of preservative strength.
The dry specimens are now being labeled by Miss Beard preparatory to being incor-
porated in the study and duplicate series. During the year the shells of the family
Mactride have been carefully named and arranged by Dr. Dall in connection with
his study of the group. ‘The tree snails of the Philippine Islands have been brought
together, arranged essentially according to Pilsbry’s ‘‘ Manual of Conchology,” and
placed on exhibition.

The present condition of the exhibition and study series, both of
recent and Tertiary mollusks, is indicated by the curator in the following
words:

The general marine collection occupies the drawers of the cases running along the |
middle of the main hall; the collection from the west coast of North and South
America and the general collection of land and fresh-water shells are in the south-
eastern gallery; the Jeffreys collection and the collections from the West Indies and
east coast of North America are in the curator’s offices in the north tower; the Lea
collection of Naiads is exhibited in the table cases in the eastern half of the main
hall; the tree snails from the Philippine Islands are exhibited in two table cases in
the western half of the main hall; the duplicates are stored in the basement; the
alcoholic collection occupies the basement room, part of the northeastern gallery,
and two rooms in the north tower; the collection of Tertiary fossils is in the north-
eastern gallery.

Dr. Dall has partially completed his studies of the genus Cerion, nam-
ing three new subgenera, founded on internal jamelle, and has finished
his study and arrangement of the family Mactridw, and the classifi-
cation of the Pelecypoda. The results have been published in the
Proceedings of the National Museum and elsewhere. He has also
continued his work on the Floridian Tertiary fauna.
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson has completed his investigations of the land
snailsof the West Indies, and has carried on through the year his studies
of the Naiads of the Lea and general collections, resulting in a paper
soon to appear in the Proceedings of the National Museum on the
classification and geographical distribution of these forms.

The collection has been enriched during the year by the results of the
explorations of Prof, Alexander Agassiz on the yacht Wild Duck, among
the Bahamas. The Museum was presented with a series in return for
the services of Dr. Dall in working up the collections.

Explorations of the mollusk fauna of San Pedro Bay, California, have
been carried on systematically by a group of conchologists, especially
Miss IdaShepard and Mr. 'T. 8. Oldroyd, for some years. The doubtful
forms have been worked out at the Museum, and a series of them,
including many varieties, has been donated by the collectors. Explo-
rations by the California Academy of Sciences in the Lower California
Peninsula have resulted in collecting some fine and rare land shells, of
which a series has been donated to the Museum by the academy.

Assistance has been extended to several conchologists by the loan
of material from the collections for study in connection with special
investigations. To three specialists have been accorded facilities for
studying the collections of this department in the curator’s laboratory.
A list of these transactions will be found in another part of the Report.

The curator has determined a large amount of material, including
1,701 species forwarded for examination and report by seventy students
and institutions. He has also carried on an extensive correspondence
in the way of supplying technical information in reply to special
inquiries from conchological students in all parts of the world.

The curator has published sixteen papers during the year, almost
all of which have a direct bearing on the work of this department.
Dr. R. E. C. Stearns published two papers in the “Nautilus.” Five
papers based on material belonging to the department were published
by Mr. Simpson—four in the “ Nautilus” and one in the Proceedings
‘of the National Museum.

In connection with the entry in the catalogue of material belonging
to this department, several volumes are used for convenience, and the
total number of entries in these books indicates the entire number
made during the year.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS.

The report of the honorary curator, Prof.C. V. Riley, shows an increase
in the number of accessions, there being 173 in 1895 against 163 in the
preceding year. The most important gifts in 1895 were as follows:
A collection of Odonata from Chinese Turkestan, presented by Dr.
William L. Abbott, whose generosity to the Museum has been so
frequently manifested in his gifts to this and other departments both
in this and in previous years; a collection of Lepidoptera from Guiana,
presented by the British Guiana Commission to the World’s Columbian
Exposition; a large collection of Lepidoptera from Jombené Range,
Kast Africa, presented by Mr. William Astor Chanler and Lieutenant
von Hohnel; a collection of Japanese insects representing 1,500 species
of all orders from the Imperial University, Tokyo, Japan; types of 35
species of Noctuids from Prof. J. B. Smith, New Brunswick, N.J. Other
valuable collections were acquired by exchange.

The biologie material of Coleoptera, including a large collection of
European larvie, obtained in past years by exchange with Schiédte and
Meynert in Copenhagen, as well as by Professor Riley’s own collectings
and breedings, has been arranged in systematic order in two cabinets.
A large part of the year was devoted to the study and proper arrange-
ment of the exotic Coleoptera. This work was undertaken primarily
to facilitate report upon the Japanese collection and the material
obtained in East Africa by Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. William Astor Chan-
ler, and Lieutenant von Hohnel.

The urgent demand for space in other directions rendered it neces-
sary to temporarily withdraw from exhibition the series illustrating
systematic entomology. The study series are reported to be in good
condition. A large amount of material, especially in the orders Hyme-
noptera and Coleoptera, remains unidentified, owing to pressure of work
in other orders.

During the year the curator commenced a comprehensive study of
the Termites of the world. The assistant, Mr. M. L. Linell, began a
study of the Coleopterous fauna of the Galapagos Islands and its rela-
tion to the continent.

In ten instances material from this department was placed in the
hands of specialists for study and identification. Eight entomologists
have taken advantage of facilities offered to study material in the
curator’s offices.

The curator, his collaborators, and other specialists in entomology
have published during the year 51 papers based upon the Museum
collections. These are mentioned by titles under the names of the
authors, in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Twelve new genera and
329 new species are described in these papers. This remarkably large
number was due to the descriptions by Mr. W. H. Ashmead of new
genera and species from St. Vincent, forwarded by the West India
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

committee for identification. Under this arrangement with Mr. Ash-
mead one set of types has been deposited in the U. 8. National
Museum.

The number of specimens received during the year is about 3,000.
This does not include the Japanese collection of about 10,000. speci-
mens, which was received during the previous year, but not taken up
on the accession records until the year 1894-95. The last entry in the
catalogue in June, 1894, was 1423, and in June, 1895, 1584.

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

An important feature of work in this department has been the dis-
tribution of duplicate collections of marine invertebrates. Forty-two
sets have been disposed of in response to applications from educational
establishments. Reference to these and all other distributions made
during the year will be found in Appendix x. In only four of the
other departments of the Museum—minerals, geology, fishes, and pre-
historic anthropology—has any systematic work in separating the
duplicates for this purpose been possible. From this department, in
addition, twenty-one special collections were also sent out for Museum
purposes and for study. The work of preparing these collections has
devolved upon the assistant curators, Mr. James EH, Benedict and Miss
Mary J. Rathbun. The honorary curator, Mr. Richard Rathbun, has
been able to devote only a very limited amount of time to Museum
matters, being almost exclusively engaged in the work of the Fish
Commission, to which he is officially attached.

There was an increase of eleven accessions over the number received
in the preceding year, and the scientific value of the accessions for
this year far exceeded that of those acquired in the preceding year.
The total number of specimens added to the collections in 1895 was
2,378. The United States Fish Commission was the principal con-
tributor, and from it were received four collections, comprising a large
and valuable series of Holothurians and Foraminifera, resulting from
the cruise of the Albatross to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, types of
Calamocrinus diomedee Agassiz, and Brachyura and Anomura from
the North Pacific Ocean, the latter group containing a fine series of
Lithodide. A collection of crustaceans and worms from the Azores
was contributed by Prof. William Trelease, director of the Missouri
Botanical Garden, St. Louis, as a part of the result of his expedition.
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., transmitted an interesting series of
invertebrates from near San Diego, Cal. This, and numerous other
collections received from Dr. Mearns, was the result of an arrangement
made between the War Department and the Smithsonian Institution
in connection with the work of determining the boundary line between
the United States and Mexico. Mr. Warren W. Herman contributed
erustaceans, echinoderms, and hydractinians from Japan. Mr, Harlan
I. Smith, of Saginaw, Mich., sent crayfishes, sponges, and bryozoans
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65
from riversin Michigan. He also transmitted some Oniscidie. Impor-
tant accessions were secured in exchange from the Indian Museum,
Calcutta; Manchester Museum, Manchester, England; University of
California, Berkeley, Cal.; State University of Iowa; Leland Stanford
Junior University; Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, New York; Can-
terbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand; Museum of Compara-
tive Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., and from several individuals.

The room at the west end of the Smithsonian building, known as the
“Chapel,” is at present used as the exhibition hall for objects belong-
ing to this department. The space being so limited, it is necessary to
use great care in selecting from the mass of material the most suitable
specimens for exhibition. The result is as pleasing as is possible
under the circumstances, and much has been done during the year
to maintain and inerease the interest of visitors. The work accom-
plished in the preservation and installation of the collections, includ-
ing not only the limited number of objects which are on exhibition,
but also the much larger portions of the collections which form the
reserve and study series, will be best understood from the following
paragraphs taken from the annual report submitted by Mr. Benedict:

The exhibition series does not differ essentially from its condition a year ago.
Five old-fashioned flat ebony cases in the west hall have been replaced by mahogany
ones. The systematic series has been removed from the center to the north end of
the hall, and two of the table cases from near the center to the aleove. Labels for
the collection of mounted commercial sponges have been prepared for the printer.

basement room formerly used by the department of reptiles was early in the
‘assigned to this department, and with the aid of the additional storage thus
orded it was proposed to make a more systematic arrangement of the alcoholics
stored in the basement. But later this room was transferred to another department,
and the contents were moved to a small and dark tower room leading from the gal-
jery used as a workroom.

The collection of annelids has been rearranged in a drawer stack in the gallery,
The collections stored in homeopathic vials in the gallery*have been gone over, and
alcohol und new stoppers added where necessary. The large collection of Alaskan
sponges recently returned by Mr. Lambe has been entered in the catalogue and
duplicates selected. In the winter it became necessary to overhaul thirty of the
duplicate sets put up a year before, as many of the tin cases were rusted. These
were renewed or the specimens transferred to jars.

By far the most important work in the way of adding to the study series was the
return of vast collections of material received from the United States Fish Commis-
sion between the years 1871 and 1887, and stored at the Peabody Museum, New
Haven, Conn., in charge of Prof. A. E. Verrill, pending a report upon the same,
In order that the return of the specimens might be facilitated, Mr. Benedict spent
about three months of the past year in New Haven, assisting in sorting and pack-
ing under the direction of Professor Verrill, the first set of duplicates being set
aside for Professor Verrill, and the remaining duplicates and the reserve set being
returned to the National Museum. Much of the unidentified material has been
treated as if named, a division being made and one set returned to the National
Museum. The unnamed sponges were catalogued before their return, and occupy
nearly 100 numbers in the catalogue book. Miss K. J. Bush has been employed
throughout the year in dividing the Mollusca into three sets, the third set being
for Mr. Sanderson I. Smith. After the arrival of the material in Washington, an

invoice is made and the mollusks are turned over to the department of mollusks.
During the year 1894-95, 68 cases of invertebrates have been shipped, containing
about 7,509 lots of specimens. A beginning has been made in card-cataloguing the
specimens received from this source.

In connection with the preparation of an exhibit for the Atlanta
Exposition, it is proposed to make a series of mountings of dried speei-
mens, especially deep-sea corals, echinoderms, ete. These will later
form a part of the permanent exhibit of the department.

Notwithstanding the necessarily great expenditure of time in the
routine work, Mr. Benedict has continued his studies of Anomura,
especially of the large forms of the family Lithodidie, resulting in a
paper, describing many new genera and species, which has recently been
published in the Proceedings of the National Museum. He has also
devoted such time as he could spare to the study of the Paguride.

Miss Rathbun completed her study of the genus Callinectes, and a
report upon the same is now in press, as is also a paper containing
descriptions of new species of fresh-water crabs. Work on the genera!
subject of American brachyurans has been continued. Miss Rath!
spent about two weeks at the Museum of Comparative Zooloe”
making comparisons of specimens, and in examining Prof. A.
Edwards’s types of West Indian crabs.

Besides the large collections obtained from the dredgings 6
U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross off the west e
Mexico, Central and South America, and off the Galapagos
under the charge of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, and from other eX;
tions made by the Albatross, several other explorations in this \
previous years have resulted in the acquisition of valuable materi,
such, for instance, as the deep-sea dredgings in the Indian Ocean }
Her Majesty’s Indian marine survey steamer Jnvestigator, which brought
to the Museum a valuable collection of crustaceans and corals; t
natural history work of the Mexican boundary Commission, througn
the efforts of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., and the dredgings made by
Mr. William E. Hoyle, chieflyin the Firth of Clyde, which were deposited
in the Manchester Museum, whence an interesting collection was trans-
mitted to the National Museum in exchange. The Museum was the
recipient of important collections obtained through explorations under
the auspices of the Leland Stanford Junior University and the Univer-
sity of California, along the coast of California. The collecting expedi-
tion of Mr. L. M. McCormick, curator of the Glen Island Museum, Glen
Island, New York, in the vicinity of Aden, Arabia, also yielded some
very interesting material, a part of which was secured in exchange.

Assistance has been extended to several specialists by the loan of
material belonging to this department. The Museum is under many
obligations to Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, of the Geological Survey
of Canada, for his generous aid in the study and determination of
a large collection of sponges from the North Atlantic Ocean, and of a
smaller collection of mounted Alaskan sponges. Prof. Edward Potts,

Fish
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

Philadelphia, Pa.,and Dr. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., have also identified collections, for which
courtesies the Museum extends its most grateful acknowledgments.
The facilities of the laboratory of this department have, as usual, been
placed at the disposal of specialists desiring to avail themselves of the
privilege.

The titles of eleven papers by Mr. Benedict, Miss Rathbun, Dr. Wal-
ter Faxon, Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, and others, based wholly or in
part on Museum material, were published during the year. Five of
these appeared in the Proceedings of the National Museum. They are
all mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Thirteen
new genera, 69 new species, and one new subspecies are described in
these papers. Their names will be found in the supplements to the
Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The number of entries made in the catalogues of the department dur-
ing the year was 1,803. These were assigned to the several books, as
follows:

HELMINTHOLOGICAL COLLECTION.

For several years material suitable for such a collection has been
slowly accumulating, but no attempt has been made until recently to
provide for its systematic preservation and classification. In this work
the Museum now enjoys the cooperation of Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the
Bureau of Animal Industry in the Department of Agriculture, who
received a formal appointment on March 17, 1894. It is a source of
much gratification that Dr. Stiles has found it possible to assume the
duties of custodian of this collection, and the Museum recognizes with
pleasure the addition of another friendly bond between the scientific
staff of the Department of Agriculture and that of the Museum.

Under date of January 9, 1894, Dr. Stiles wrote as follows regarding
the formation of a section of helminthology:

In order to collect and preserve the types of American species of parasites,
and in order to obtain a collection of the typical specimens of parasites of this
and other countries, I think it would be extremely desirable if the U.S. National
Museum would establish a department of medical zoology or helminthology. As I
know that you would favor such a step, I would respectfully submit the following
proposition, in case the Museum does not see its way clear or does not think it
possible to appoint a full curator to take charge of this subject:

I will tender my services as curator without pay, or as honorary curator of
helmirthology or of medical zoology, and will agree to deposit my private collection
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

in the Museum, under such terms as we shail agree upon, as @ nucleus of the collec
tion, in case you can give me a room in which the specimens may be kept, and the
neressary apparatus (bottles, ete.) to take care of material which may be sent in.

On January 13 I addressed the following reply to Dr. Stiles:

I need not say that I shall be very glad indeed to have you attached to the Museum
staff in an honorary capacity. I do not think we wish to establish a section of
medical zoology, but a section of helminthology, in connection with one of the
zoological curatorships, would be very desirable.

This letter was followed, on March 17, by a formal letter of appoint-
ment from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

By an arrangement already completed, the collection will be enriched
by the transfer of the collections made by the Bureau of Animal Indus-
try and by Dr. Stiles personally. The collections of Dr. Hassall and
Dr. Leidy will also be temporarily turned over to the Museum. By
exchanges with museums in Berlin and Vienna, as well as with various
specialists, much important material will, it 1s expected, be obtained.
An invitation has already been extended to all workers in helminthol-
ogy to deposit types or typical specimens in the Museum. Several
colleges have been supplied with parasitic material for study, from the
reserve series, and it is hoped that by pursuing a generous policy in
this direction the Museum will ultimately be the recipient of much
desirable material.

The greater part of the collection at present consists of material
which has been obtained by Dr. Salmon, chief of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, Department of Agriculture, Dr. Stiles, and Dr. Albert
Hassall, who is also on the official staff of the Bureau. Dr. Salmon
has deposited a number of types of species which have been described
in the publications of that Bureau. Dr. Hassall has presented several
cotypes of species described by Cobbold. Through Dr. Stiles’s oftices
a collection of types of species described by Dr. Leidy and belonging
to the University of Pennsylvania has been secured as a loan. In
addition, Professor Stossich, of Trieste, Austria, has transmitted a
number of parasites, and Dr. A. Looss, of Leipzig, Germany, has for-
warded, in exchange, a collection of parasites from Egypt. Dr. H. B.
Ward, of Lincoln, Nebr., has added a number of cotypes to the collee-
tion, and from Prof. R. Ramsay Wright, Toronto, Canada, and Mr.
Robert Mills, Chuluota, Fla., very acceptable material has been received.
Prof. A. Duges, of Guanajuato, Mexico, transmitted some specimens
for determination,

No attempt has yet been made to form an exhibition series. The
material obtained by Dr. Stiles is retained in the Bureau of Animal
Industry until it has been studied, after which it is formally deposited,
according to law, in the National Museum.

The Bureau of Animal Industry has partly for its object the investi-
gation of diseases of animals. The members of its staff are therefore
constantly placed in a peculiarly favorable position for obtaining
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

parasitic material. The Bureau has published a large number of valua-
ble papers based on its investigations, and new studies in scientific
and economic helminthology are being constantly commenced. Thus,
Dr. Stiles, who has just completed his “ Revision of the Adult Leporine
Cestodes,” is now engaged in a study of the cestodes of birds.

The titles of papers published during the year by Dr. Stiles and Dr.
Hassall, based upon material in the collections, are given in the Bibli-
ography (Appendix Iv).

At the end of June, 1895, 106 entries had been made in the catalogue.

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The curator of this department, Mr. I’. A. Lueas, reports that about
250 specimens have been added to the collection during the year. The
accession of greatest value is the skeleton of the type of Cervicapra
Chanleri. This was collected by Mr. William Astor Chanler in the Tana
River region, Kast Africa, and was presented by him to the National
Museum. Some desirable birds in alcohol have been received from Dr.
Edgar A. Mearns, resulting from his participation in the work of the

Under the direction of Mr. Lucas the work of cleaning skulls of mam-
mals and skeletons and sterna of birds has been continued. During
the year 850 skulls have been thus treated for the department of mam-
mals alone. These are entered in the catalogue of the mammal depart-
ment, and therefore the total number of entries in the catalogue of
this department is correspondingly diminished.

Mr. Lueas has continued his studies on the anatomy of the switts
and the tyrant fly catchers, on the taxonomic values of the tendinal
perforations of the tarsus in birds, and on the modifications and taxo-
nomic value of the tongues of birds. He has also commenced a study
of the osteology of Zeugiodon cetoides and of the cranial characters of
the finches and tanagers.

Specimens of birds in alcohol have been lent to Mr. Hubert Lyman
Clark and to Mr. W. P. Pyeraft in connection with their studies of the
embryology and pterylography of birds, and other material belonging
to the department has been transmitted for investigation and compari-
son to Prof. H. D. Cope, Dr. C. S. Huntington, and Prof. H. I’. Osborn.

Several papers by the author, based on Museum material, have been
published in the Proceedings of the National Museum, the “Ibis,” the
“Auk,” and in “ Natural Science.”

The chief drawback to satisfactory progress in this department, as
in many of the other departments, is lack of space. Mr. Lucas has,
however, several plans for future work laid out, and these are best
given in his own words:

Little can be done for the improvement of the study series, owing to lack of room,
but there are many specimens, especially among the birds. which need to be trans-

ferred to proper boxes and labeled, and this will be done as fast as opportunity
offers, while such specimens as can be cleaned will be added to the study series.
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The collection of fish skeletons is in bad shape ewing to cramped quarters; but
little or nothing can be done with it, although it is hoped that a little room may be
made available by placing material now in the study series on exhibition in the
eases recently placed above the wall case.

Much ean be done to improve the exhibition series by providing more descriptive
labels, and there are some gaps in the series of skeletons, especially among the fishes
and reptiles, that it is hoped may be filled. There are various series of specimens
which may be either introduced or added to, among them that commenced during
the year showing the modifications of the dermis and epidermis. A very important
series which it is hoped may be commenced soon is that showing the morphology of
the bones of the mammalian earand hyoid. Another important piece of work which
has merely been begun is the representation of extinct forms in the series of skele-
tons. Itis desirable that this should be done in order that the relations of existing
animals may be properly understood, and it is proposed to introduce in their proper
places typical fossils or casts of fossils, supplemented by figures of the entire skele-
ton, these to be accompanied by suitable explanatory labels giving the anatomical
characters, affinities, and geological range of the various orders or other groups.
It is also desirable to extend the tooth series, the series of domesticated animals,
and above all the synoptic series of invertebrates.

In this connection the curator would call attention to the fact that the care of the
fossil vertebrates takes much of his time, and that the time of the one preparator
and one skilled laborer allotted to the department of comparative anatomy is very
largely occupied with work for the departments of mammals and paleontology.

are shown in the following table:

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY.

It has for many years been felt desirable to centralize all the paleon-
tological collections under one general administration, but not uitil
the present fiscal year has it been found possible to effect the necessary
arrangements. Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the U. 8. Geological
Survey, has accepted the honorary charge of all the paleontological col-
lections, with Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator. The several
divisions of the department which have heretofore existed still remain,
with one exception, under the charge of the same officers who have
hitherto controlled them. The principal object gained by the changeis
that all paleontological material, as soon as it arrives at the Museum, is
assigned to the main department, thus securing a better system of
record than formerly, and thence it is assigned to the special division or
divisions of the department to which it belongs. It will now also be
possible to bring the work incident to the installation of all the paleon-
tological material under one uniform system, and at the same time to
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. tL

relieve several of the custodians of the necessity of attending to the
details of this work.

The personnel of this department now includes Hon. C. D. Waleott
as honorary curator, with Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator.
The vertebrate fossils are still under the charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh,
although the actual work on these collections has been performed by
Mr. F. A. Lucas. The invertebrate fossils are divided among Mr. Schu-
chert, Mr. T. W. Stanton, and Dr. W. H. Dall, while the fossil plants
remain under the general supervision of Prof. Lester F. Ward, with Mr.
F. H. Knowlton and Mr. David White as custodians of the Mesozoic
and Paleozoic collections, respectively.

Dr. Charles A. White, who for many years has personally had the
entire charge of the Mesozoic collection of invertebrate fossils, is now
largely relieved of this work by Mr. Stanton. Dr. White has been
designated ‘‘Associate in Paleontology.” The Museum owes a large
debt of gratitude to him for his efficient work on the Mesozoic collee-
tion of invertebrate fossils, and it is a source of congratulation that
the advantages of his advice and honorary connection with the Museum
are to be continued.

The increase in and the scientific value of the paleontological collec-
tions received during the year are regarded as very gratifying, espe-
cially in the case of the vertebrate fossils. This collection, under the
curatorship of Prof. O. ©. Marsh, of Yale College, has been increased
by the addition of about 65 specimens. Among the more important of
these is a large collection of bones of Zeuglodon gathered in Missis-
sippi and Alabama by Mr. Charles Schuchert. Thirty vertebrie of
Zeuglodon were also obtained, in exchange, from the Agricultural and
Mechanical College, Agricultural College, Miss. In addition, Mr.
Schuchert collected a large number of specimens of Middle Devonian
corals from Moreland, Ky. <A skull of bison from the Kansas gravels
was presented by Dr. A. G. Chase, and a skull of Portheus molossus by
Mr. KE. E, Howell. Casts of a number of fossils have been obtained by
exchanges with the Museum of Natural History iv Paris, the La Plata
Museum, and with Mr. Henry A. Ward, of Rochester, N.Y. A cast of
a Skeleton of Pelargosaurus typus was acquired by an exchange with
the University of Caen, France, and an excellent specimen of Ichthyo-
saurus from Lyme Regis, England, was received in exchange from the
Wagner Free Institute, Philadelphia, Pa.

A small series of fossils has been placed on exhibition, and a num-
ber of large casts placed on the walls or on the tops of the wall cases.
From the collection of bones of Zeuglodon a restoration, more than 50
feet in length, has been made for exhibition at the Atlanta Exposition.
This will be added to the exhibition series after its return to Washing-
ton. The many casts of vertebrates in foreign museums received
during the year are of great value for comparative and decorative pur-
poses. Although the exhibit of this section of the paleontological
department is but small, it has already attracted much attention, and
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the easts and fossil bones of large vertebrates are a constant source of
wonder and interest to visitors. A loan of the type of Aceratherium
occidentale was made to Prof. H. I°. Osborn for use in his studies of the
extinet species of rhinoceros in North America. A large number of
specimens received previously have been catalogued only during this
year. These, together with the entry of material received in 1894-95,
make a total of 283 entries in the catalogue, the last number taken up
in June, 1894, being 1655, and in June, 1895, 1918.

One of the most important accessions to the department of paleon-
tology, from the standpoint of scientific value, is the collection of Ter-
tiary insects from Colorado and Wyoming, received from the U. 8. Geo-
logical Survey. The greater part of it has already been described
and illustrated by Prof. Samuel H. Scudder in Monograph xxt of the
Survey.

The magnificent collection of fossil plants, including also some fossil
fishes, presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., has been referred
to in previous reports. The removal of the collection to Washington
was placed in the hands of Mr. David White, who has pushed the work
rapidly forward with untiring and intelligent perseverance. The sixth
installment has been received during the year. This consisted of two
boxes of fishes from New Jersey, three boxes of Cretaceous and Tertiary
plants, and 43 boxes of Paleozoic plants.

Itis expected that additional material will be received during the
coming year, and in the Report for 1895-96 a more extended reference
will be made to the character and contents of this exceedingly valuable
collection.

Much has been accomplished toward housing and arranging the mate-
rial. During the year 104 boxes have been unpacked, and with the
specimens received in former years this coilection fills the 600 drawers
purchased for the collection, to which the two south tower rooms are
devoted. The arrangement and installation of the material has been
performed by Mr. David White.

A large collection of Middle Cambrian fossils from British Columbia,
fossil plants from Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and fossil fishes,
plants, and insects from the Triassic in Massachusetts, have been
received from the U. S. Geological Survey. Mr. R. A. Blair, Sedalia,
Mo., has presented 60 specimens of Lower Carboniferous fossils, includ-
ing several specimens of a well-preserved graptolite (Dictyonema).
Their occurrence extends the known range of these coelenterates into
the base of the Lower Carboniferous. This is a matter of considerable
scientific importance, as graptolites had not hitherto been known to
oceur above the Middle Devonian.

The exhibit of the paleontological material is contained, so far as at
present prepared, in the southeast court, which has been again opened
to the public. A new and more appropriate entrance to the court was
cut through the south wall, and the eastern one closed. The former
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

crowded condition of the court was relieved by removing the plants
and vertebrates from the slope-top cases to the wall cases, allowing
eight slope-top cases to be discarded. Thirty-two of these cases remain
for the exhibition of invertebrate fossils. The plants and vertebrates
are being arranged in the wall cases, with the four corners of the room
occupied by large slabs of tracks, standing on screens. All the fossil
insects in the department have been assembled and appropriately
mounted with figures on tiles. This collection is now on exhibition in
a flat-top case.

Considerable time has been expended in caring for the paleozoic col-
lections of the Geological Survey, 20 boxes having been unpacked and
the specimens washed and provisionally assorted.

Work on the paleozoic plants will be pushed to completion by Mr.
David White, on his return to Washington. The exhibits of the ineso-
zoic and cenozoic plants are nearing completion, and the manuscript
for the labels is nearly ready for the printer. Three additional cases
are required by Professor Ward, which, with the 7 already assigned,
will permit of 5 being devoted to the Lacoe collection of paleozoic plants
and the other 5 to mesozoic and cenozoic plants. If sufficient cases
can be provided, it will no doubt be possible to install an exhibit of
vertebrate fossils, under the supervision of Mr. Lucas, which will prove
very attractive and instructive.

The invertebrate fossils exhibited and stored in the 32 slope-top cases
will require much labor in connection with the selecting, mounting,
and working up of nearly 400 boxes now in storage. Much of this
material in storage is the property of the Geological Survey, but is all
at the disposal of the Museum as soon as an opportunity occurs to
work it up.

The study series practically remains in the same condition as formerly
This collection also requires much work to remove the duplicate mate-
rial and to clean and enter upon the Museum registers all material
desirable for the permanent collections.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies of fossil Brachiopoda, and it
is hoped that a paperresulting from this work, to be entitled “Synopsisof
North and South American Fossil Brachiopoda, including Bibliography
and Synonymy” will soon be ready for publication. The special studies
of Dr. Dall are referred to under the head of the department of mollusks.

Material in the custody of this department has been lent for study to
Prof. John M. Clarke, Albany, N. Y.; to Prof. William B. Clark, Johns
Hopkins University, and to Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, of the Geological
Survey of Canada. Fossils have been sent to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, of New-
port, Ky., and to Prof. John M. Clarke for identification, and the
Museum is under obligations to these gentlemen for their courtesy in
this connection.

Although there is a great quantity of most interesting material for
study and description ov hand in all of the various collections of this
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

department, there has been afforded very little opportunity for the
preparation of papers for publication during the year, on account of the
large amount of preliminary work necessary in the way of arrangement
and classification. Mr. Knowlton has, however, published five papers
relating to paleobotany, and in them one new genus and seven new
species are described.

The number of specimens received during the year, so far as they can
be counted, is upward of 6,642, not including the Lacoe collection of 44
boxes, and the collection of bones of Zeuglodon.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANTS (NATIONAL HERBARIUM).

The most important matter affecting this department was the formal
transfer of the Herbarium from the Department of Agriculture to the
National Museum building. This was the result of correspondence
between the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture and the Acting Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. Copies of the letters are here
presented. The history of the growth of the Herbarium will interest
many, and a brief statement relative to the same is here given.

At the time when definite lines of policy were adopted in order to
secure the expenditure of the income of the Smithsonian Institution in
such a manner as most effectually to carry out the intention of the
founder in his purpose of promoting the ‘‘increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men,” it was determined to make no appropriation of
the funds to further or support any object which could be equally well
accomplished by some other agency. In pursuance of this policy an
arrangement was effected with the Commissioner of Agriculture to
transfer the National Herbarium of the Institution to the care of the
Department of Agriculture. The Herbarium then contained 15,000 to
20,000 specimens from all parts of the world, properly classified and
labeled. These specimens were the result of various expeditions of the
Government and of special explorations carried on under the auspices
of the Institution. The collection had from the first been under the
eare of Dr. Gray and Dr. Torrey, who served without compensation.
Upon their retirement the desirability of employing a competent bota-
nist became obvious. On account of lack of money, however, it was not
possible to make the position a salaried one, and therefore it became
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75

necessary to seek some other means of providing for the care of the
collection. The Department of Agriculture was, as already stated,
asked to assume this responsibility. It consented, with the under-
standing that the appointment of the botanist to be placed in charge
should be approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
that the collections should be accessible to the publie for practical or
educational purposes, and also accessible to the Institution for scien-
tific investigation. It was further agreed that full credit be given to
the Institution in the publications of the Department for the deposit of
the original specimens as well as tor such additions as the Institution
might make from time to time.

The tollowing agreement was formally signed by the Commissioner of
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

First. All the botanical specimens in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution,
about 20,000, and all that may hereafter be collected by it, shall be transferred to the
Agricultural Department on the following terms:

1. That a competent botanist, approved by the Institution, shall be appointed to
have charge of the collection.

2. That the collection shall, at all times, be accessible to the public for educational
purposes and to the Institution for scientific investigation, or for supplying any
information in regard to plants that correspondents may ask for.

3. That due credit be given to the Institution in the report of the Agricultural
Department for the original deposit and for such additions as may be made to it,
from time to time, by the Institution.

Second. That the Agricultural Department shall transfer to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution any specimens it may now have, or may hereafter obtain, that are not neces-
sary to illustrate agricultural economy, such as those of ethnology and of various
branches of natural history, similar credit to be given in this case as required in
the former.

The transfer was made in 1869, and the conditions were fulfilled. Dr.
Parry was appointed botanist, and at once commenced a systematic
arrangement of the Herbarium. He found the number of species to be
about 15,000, included in 25,000 specimens. The most valuable portions
of the Herbarium thus transmitted by the Smithsonian Institution to
the Department of Agriculture were:

1. The plants collected by the exploring expedition under Admiral
Wilkes (1838-1842). The botanists of this expedition were Mr. William
Rich, Dr. Charles Pickering, and Mr. W. I. D. Brackenridge.

2. The collection of plants made by Mr. Charles Wright during the
North Pacific Exploring Expedition, under Commanders Ringgold and
Rodgers (1853-1856).

3. The plants collected by the naturalists who accompanied several
surveying parties which made explorations for the route of a Pacifie
railroad.

4, Collections made during the survey for the Mexican boundary by
Dr. C. C. Parry, Dr. J. M. Bigelow, Mr. C. Wright, Prof. George Thurber,
and Mr. Arthur Schott.

5. Numerous contributions to the North American portion of the
76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Herbarium, also plants from British America, Japan, Mantehuria, China,
Sandwich Islands, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, and Para-
guay; also from Hungary, Illyria, and other parts of Europe. Collee-
tions were also received from the Imperial Academy of Science at St.
Petersburg and from the Imperial Botanic Garden.

During the twenty-six years following the transfer, up to the year
1894, many large and valuable accessions have been added, a large
proportion of which was received by the Department of Agriculture.
The Herbarium now contains not less than 275,000 specimens.

The fact that the Herbarium was not housed in a fireproof building
has been the occasion of criticism, and during the session of the Botan-
ical Congress in Madison, Wis.,' this subject was discussed and the
following resolutions drafted:

Whereas the National Herbarium, with all its wealth of specimens of inestimable
value, is at present deposited in a building which from its construction and use is
peculiarly liable to destruction by fire; and

Whereas such destruction would be an irreparable loss to the science of botany;
therefore, be it

Resolved, Vhat we, the members of the Madison Botanical Congress, hereby appeal
to the Senators and Representatives of the National Congress to make early provision
for a suitable fireproof )uilding for the preservation of this scientilic treasure, and
we would respectfully request the Secretary of Agriculture to urge upon Congress
the desirability of prompt action in this matter.

Actuated, no doubt, in part by the sense of responsibility involved,
the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in a letter, having the approval
of the Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 24, 1894, and addressed to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, after recognizing the
Institution as the lawful custodian of the scientific collections of the
Government, requested the transfer of the Herbarium to the immediate
custody of the Institution. To this the Institution assented, in a letter
dated July 28, 1894, signed by the Acting Secretary. A third letter,
addressed by the Seeretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, dated August 16, 1894, directed the transfer
of the Herbarium. The actual removal of the collection was effected
in September, 1894.

Mr. Frederick V. Coville, botanist of the Department of Agriculture,
has succeeded Dr. George Vasey as honorary curator of the depart-
ment of botany, and in this capacity is in charge ot the National
Herbarium. Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agriculture, has
been appointed assistant curator.

The correspondence above referred to is here presented :

FROM TILL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.

JULY.24, 1894.
Sir: The Smithsonian Institution, as we understand it, is designated by law the
enstodian of all of the scientilic collections of the Government. This Department
has already transferred many collections, parts of collections, and specimens to the
care of your Institution, and will, it is hoped, continue to do so from time to time.

1 August 23, 1893
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Cb

The collection of plants known as the National Herbarium has been left in the
immediate charge of this Department, the expense of its care, maintenance, and
extension being annually provided for in our appropriations.

This collection is, we are informed, a very valuable one, especially since it con-
tains a great number of ‘‘type specimens” from the Fremont, Wilkes, and other
expeditions, and deserves to be housed and cared for in the most reliable and efii-
cient manner. It is at present located in the offices of the division of botany in the
main building of the Department of Agriculture. As is well known, this building
is not firepreof, and is considered to be unsafe for other reasons

I write, therefore, with the approval of the Honorable Secretary, to ask the Smith-
sonian Institution to provide a place for this collection. Being desirous of relief
from further responsibility for the safety of this collection, which is connected only
in part with the work under our charge, we feel that we have a right to make this
request of your Institution.

Since the botanist of the Department of Agriculture is also curator of the Her-
barium, and since an assistant curator and several clerks and laborers are provided
to work on it, this Department would expect to continue, through these legaily
appointed officers, to do all necessary work upon the herbarium, and must, for this
purpose, have full access to it.

In addition to the space required for the Herbarium proper, several rooms will be
required for the accommodation of these workers an some storage space for duphi-
cate specimens. The details of these matters will be explained by the botanist.
This Department would expect to have the privilege of removing to its building
from time to time any portion of the Herbarium that may be required for study in
connection with its work. The working collection of fungi in the division of vege-
table pathology and the collections of the division of forestry, having been made
independently of the Herbarium and its appropriations, are not considered a part
of it and are not offered for transfer at this time. The grass collection of the Her-
barium will also be needed at this Department fer the present.

If desired, the cases and like furniture can be transferred with the collection.

Respectfully yours,
Cuas. W. DABNEY, Jr.,
Assisiant Secretary.
The SECRETARY, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D.C.

FROM THE ACTING SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

JULY 28, 1894.

Sir: Iam in receipt of your letter of July 24, asking the Smithsonian Institution
to relieve the Department of Agriculture from the responsibility for the safety of the
collections of plants known as the National Herbarium, by providing a place for it in
a fireproof building.

Iappreciate fully the value of the National Herbarium, and although all the build-
ings under the charge of the Institution are already overcrowded, I find that it is
possible, by still further condensing, to assign to the collections of plants which you
offer to transfer, together with those already here, a space on one of the balconies
in the new Museum building with the adjoining laboratory rooms, which, though
inadequate for its proper reception will, in a certain way, meet the necessities of the
case, and which has at least the recommendation of being free from the danger of fire.

Tf the caces and other furniture referred to in your letter can be transferred to the
Museum, I see no reason why the plants may not be received at any time that may
suit the convenience of the Department.

I understand it to be your purpose that the botanist of the Department of Agri-
culture shall retain the position of honorary curator of the botanical collections in
(i REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the National Museum, which he now holds by courtesy of the Department of Agri-
culture and by comm‘ssion from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. This
is very acceptable, as is also your proposition that certain other employees of the
Department of Agriculture shall continue to work upon the herbarium under his
direction. While the Institution is prepared to provide a safe place for the herbarium
and preserve it from deterioration, it can not at present assume any expense ‘or
maintaining and enlarging it. I speak of this for the purpose of emphasizing the
fact that if the herbarium is to fulfill its function of continued usefulness to the
Department of Agriculture, it will be necessary that the Department shall contribute
to its maintenance as in the past. In order to render this possible, the work-rooms
already referred to will be available to accommodate the persons engaged in this
work under the direction of the botanist.

Every facility will be afforded to the Department for the use not only of the Her-
barium to be transferred, but of all the other botanical material and collections in
the Museum, together with the extensive botanical library belonging to the Institn-
tion. Portions of the collection of plants may be withdrawn for study upon the
request of the botanist of the Department of Agriculture, so far as is consistent with
their safe-keeping and proper use.

Inote what you say in regard to the collections in the divisions of vegetable pathol-
ogy and forestry, and have no comment to offer. The situation is, however, differ-
ent in regard to the grasses, for, since they constitute part of the herbarium proper,
and a considerable portion of them have been deposited with the Department of
Agriculture by the Smithsonian, it seems to me that this fact should he recognized,
and that the custody of the grasses should be transferred to the Institution with the
rest of the herbarium, although, in accordance with the terms of the agreement just
stated, it is proper that as much of this collection should be retained at the Depart-
ment as is needed for the work in progress. I would suggest, however, that a full
series of the grasses be sent to our fireproof building as soon as practicable, so that
in case of fire a portion of this valuable collection may be saved.

If, when you are ready to make the transfer, you will, as you suggest, request
Mr. Coville to confer with me, I will do all in my power to have the new space
arranged so as to provide in the best way for the interests of the work.

Yours very respectfully,
G. BROWN GOODE, Acting Secretary.

Hon. CHARLES W. DABNEY, JYr.,

Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, Washington City.

FROM THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.

AuGUST 16, 1894.
Str: Ihave the honor to inform you that, in compliance with the arrangements
made through correspondence with the Honorable Assistant Secretary of Agricul-
ture, I have this day directed the botanist and curator of this Department to pro-
ceed to remove the National Herbarium, its furniture, and persons engaged in
working thereon, or so much thereof as you may be able to accommodate, to the

space which you have kindly provided for it in the National Museum.
Respectfully yours,
J. STERLING MORYtoN, Secretary.

The SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

In his report for the year ending June 30, 1895, the curator, speak-
ing of the more important accessions of the year, mentions 6 which
were received through the Smithsonian Institution and 45 which came
direct to the Department of Agriculture and are now deposited in the
herbarium. References te these and all other accessions to the Herba-
rium wil] be found in the Accession List (Appendix 11). The total
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 79

number of specimens received and added to the Herbarium during the
year was 16,897. For the last half of the year the curator has included
only those specimens which were actually placed in the collection.
Previously all specimens received had been counted.

The space now occupied by the Herbarium is the east balcony of the
Museum building, with a floor area of 12 by 62 feet, four tower rooms,
each 12 by 10 feet, and two anterooms, each 8 by 10 feet. Mr. Charles
Louis Pollard, of the Department of Agriculture, assists the curator
and assistant curator in the administration of the collection.

A complete revision of the Herbarium has been found necessary
since the transfer to the Museum building was made. New labels have
been added, and the determinations of species have been carefully
examined with a view to the correction of any errors. This revision
has already extended to the Rubiacew, and it is expected that it will be
completed during the coming fiscal year.

The transfer to the main Herbarium of the collection hitherto stored
on the south balcony of the Museum building has also been com-
meneed. The dicotyledonous trees and shrubs, genera represented
in a fossil state, and the plants collected personally by Prof. Lester F.
Ward, who is in charge of the collection of fossil plants, will, however,
be retained for use in the department of paleontology.

A series illustrating the flora of the District of Columbia will be
placed in a separate case, where it will be generally accessible to
students.

Dr. Rose has undertaken the work of selecting and marking all the
type and cotype specimens in the Herbarium. The sheets to which
these specimens are attached are taken out, marked with a red label,
placed in a red folded cover, and then returned to their proper place in
the collection. During the year 46,565 specimens have been mounted.
A large part of this number consisted of specimens received in pre-
vious years, but not before mounted on account of lack of facilities for
the work,

A revision of Prof. Lester F. Ward’s “Guide to the Flora of Wash-
ington and Vicinity” has been commenced by Professor Ward and Mr.
Pollard. Other Washington botanists will assist in special groups.
Monographic work for the “Systematic Botany of North America” has
been commenced by the curator, Dr. Rose, and Mr. Pollard. Dr. Rose
has compieted and published a report on the Mexican collections gath-
ered by Mr. Edward Palmer in 1890 and 1891. He has also continued
the identification of parts of the collections obtained by Mr. C. G.
Pringle and Mr. E. W. Nelson in Mexico. Mr. Coville, in cooperation
with Mr. John B. Leiberg, has identified a large collection of plants
made by the latter in 1894 on the plains of eastern Oregon.

The field agents of the Department of Agriculture have contributed
a large amount of material from Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and
Alaska.
80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Several collections or parts of collections have been sent to special-
ists for study. These are mentioned under the head of ‘ Material lent
for investigation.” The curator names six botanists who have had
access to the herbarium during the year, to aid them in special investi-
gations. He also gives the names of 23 persons who have cooperated
with the department, especially by lending specimens for critical inves-
tigation or by themselves assisting in the identification of species.

In the Bibliography (Appendix Iv) will be found the titles of all
papers published during the year by the curator, the assistant curator,
Mr. Pollard, and two other collaborators, Mr. John M. Coulter and Mr.
L. H. Dewey. Inthe supplements to the Bibliography are included
the names of the new genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies
described in those papers.

Among the propositions which the curator submits in his report for
the better administration of the herbarium, is a plan for affording
increased case room and the transfer of the remainder of the herba-
rium to the Museum building. This is evidently desirable, and every-
thing possible will be done to meet Mr. Coville’s wishes in this respect.
He also recommends the enployment of an assistant in cryptogamic
botany, to properly classify and arrange the Pteridophyta, Bryophyta,
and Thallophyta.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 2761, and in June, 1895,
3431. .

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS.

This department continues under the care of Prof. I’. W. Clarke, chief
chemist of the U. 8S. Geological Survey.

The accessions to the collection of minerals have not been as numer-
ous aS during the previous year. The actual number of specimens
received was 1,055, embracing 140 accession numbers. The most
important of these were contributed by Rey. L. T. Chamberlain and
included, among others, the following specimens: Twenty specimens of
minerals, including garnet, beryl, quartz, agate, thomsonite, ehloras-
trolite, and sodalite from various localities, a carved ornament of quartz
from Japan, 2 specimens of quartz with inclusions from the same
locality, a specimen of turquoise in gangue from New Mexico, a ear-
buncle of garnet, 6 Amazon-stone balls, 5 chrome iron balls, 3 cut and
polished specimens of quartz, an opal from Queretaro, Mexico, a gold
nugget from California, and 2 specimens of tourmaline from Mount
Mica, Paris, Me. These were presented to the Smithsonian Institution
and deposited in the National Museum. There were also received from
Dr. Chamberlain, from the bequest of Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain,
12 Tassi paste reproductions of antiques.

From the U.S. Geological Survey have been received 8 accessions
ofmore than usual value. Three important lotsof minerals were acquired
by exchange. The names of all the contributors to the collection are
mentioned in the Accession List.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

Considerable progress has been made in supplying the exhibition
series with labels. The cases have been numbered and labels attached.
These indicate the plan of arrangement and the location of the mate-
rial. Experiments have been made with a view to determining the
best method of mounting crystals and preserving specimens which are
liable to decomposition. A special set of specimens, designated the
“educational series,” is being prepared for exhibition. The collections
of gems and meteorites are increasing very satisfactorily. ‘Two collee-
tions of minerals have been made by Mr. Wirt Tassin, assistant cura-
tor, aggregating more than 200 specimens. These have been suitably
distributed among the exhibition and study series. The field parties
of the United States Geological Survey brought in much interesting
material.

Four papers by the curator were published during the year—one as
a bulletin of the Geological Survey, two in the American Journal of
Science, and one in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
These are mentioned in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

It is the hope of the curator to establish a series of specimens illus-
trating typical famous American localities, and also a series illustrating
the type and original material in the collection, accompanied by refer-
ences to the publications in which the material was described. The
preparation of a guidebook to the collection has been commenced by
Mr. Tassin.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 83320, and in June, 1895,
83615.

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY.

There is pressing need of more exhibition space for the geological
collections, and owing to the crowded condition of the halls very little
can be added to the exhibition series. The present aim of the curator,
Mr. George P. Merrill, is therefore in the direction of eradicating the
poorer specimens and substituting better ones in their places. For
this reason probably not more than 200 specimens have been actually
added to the exhibition series during the year. Mr. Merrill repeats his
recommendation that a balcony be placed around the intericr of the
southwest court, of sufficient capacity to hold some of the lighter and
least bulky of the collections. This would allow room on the floor
for the expansion of the other collections in this departmeit. Unfor-
tunately, Congress has not taken favorable action on the request for
permission to erect galleries, and until this point has been secured,
nothing can be done to relieve the pressure either in this or the many
other departments which are similarly hampered.

The time of the curator and his assistant has been largely occupied
in bettering the condition of the exhibition series, as already intimated,
and in bringing the records of the department down to date. A card
catalogue for the collections is being prepared, and manuscript for

nearly 1,000 new labels has been written. The systematic collection of
rocks has been entirely rearranged, and the labels of the building stone
collection renewed. <A large quantity of duplicate material has been
sorted out to be used in making up the next sets of specimens for dis-
tribution. The curator has, in addition to the large amount of routine
work accomplished, found time to bring to completion his investigation
relating to the mineral nature and cause of fibrous structure of the
various minerals commercially grouped under the name “ Asbestos.”
He is also engaged in a series of investigations relative to the phenom-

=

g
ena attending rock decomposition. A brief paper on this subject, as

illustrated in the region about Washington, has been published during
the year in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. The
title of this and five other papers by the curator, and of one by Mr.
C. Whitman Cross on “The Laccolitic Mountam Groups of Colorado,
Utah and Arizona”, in which are deseribed some rocks in the Museum
collection, will be found m the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The accessions of the year numbered 79, and in addition 122 lots of
specimens were received for examination and report. The most impor-
tant of the former are: A systematic series of Stassfurt salts, pre-
sented by the German Kali Works (Nassau street, New York City);
a series of specimens of photographs of borax salts, mines, and
works, presented by the Pacific Borax Company (San Francisco, Cal.) ;
a series of granites, marbles, alabaster, etc., from Egypt, collected for
the Museum by Mr. F. W. Crosby; a large quantity of Uintahite, from
Clear Creek, Utah, received from Mr. B. W. Rice, Tucker, Utah; a
block of meerschaum from Eski Shehr, Asia Minor; a series of soap-
stone, asbestos, apatite, and fresh and decomposed rocks illustrating
weathering, collected by the curator in Nelson and Albemarle counties,
Va.; onyx from Lake Oroomah, Persia, presented by Rev. 8. G. Wil-
son, Tabriz, Persia; a series of remarkable spherulites from the Silver
Cliff region, Coloratlo, presented by Mr. C. Whitman Cross; a series
of silverores from Custer County, Colo., transmitted by the U. 8. Geolog-
ical Survey, and a large nodule of gum copal, weighing 84 pounds,
from the Upper Congo region in Africa, obtained by Mr. J. H. Camp,
Lima, Ohio, who collected for the Museum while engaged as a missionary
in the service of the American Baptist Missionary Union.

The present condition of the collection is indicated by the following

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 62393 and in June, 1895,

catalogue does not by any means necessarily indicate the addition of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

only one specimen, since a specimen may be broken up into a hundred
or more pieces, each of which would in a strict count be properly
regarded as a separate specimen.

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY.

The curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, reports that the accessions of this
year compare very favorably with those of previous years. Many
additions have resulted from gifts received from foreign exhibitors at the
World’s Columbian Exposition. Among the most important accessious
may be mentioned a rare collection of 662 specimens, illustrating the
divinatory games of vartous peoples, from the University of Pennsyl-
vania; a very valuable series of specimens from eastern Turkestan,
collected and presented by Dr. William L. Abbott, through whose gener-
osity several of the departments in the Museum have been enriched
both in this and in previous years; a large collection from west Africa,
presented by Mr. J. H. Camp and illustrating the arts and industries of
several native tribes; an extremely valuable lot of ethnological objects
from the region of Mount Kilima-Njaro, collected and presented by Mr.
William Astor Chanler; a collection from east Greenland, gathered
by Captain Holm and transmitted in the name of the Museum of Royal
Antiquities in Copenhagen, and a collection of nearly 700 articles
illustrative of the native life and arts of the Congo Free States, secured
by purchase from Mr. Dorsey Mohun. The Bureau of Ethnology has
contributed a most important series of objects collected by Mr. W J
McGee among the Papagos and Seri Indians in southwestern Arizona
and northwestern Mexico.

The already overcrowded condition of the exhibition space assigned
to this department has rendered it necessary to place in storage most
of the recently acquired material, and, to partially accommodate it, the
lower rooms of the west balcony have been provided with shelving.
Here it is proposed to store unit boxes, swinging screens, and mounted
pictures. In the north storage room will be kept the reserve and study
Series illustrating the ethnology of Asiatic and North African tribes.
The third story of the north tower is devoted to Eskimo material. A
card catalogue of the entire exhibit is being prepared.

Regarding the exhibition series, the curator remarks:

The exhibition series in the department of ethnology at the close of the fiscal
year was to be found in two groups—the material actually on exhibition for public
inspection and the exhibition series returned from the Chicago Exposition, which
had been filed away for future use. A great many of these were also designated to
be sent to Atlanta. The series actually displayed is exhibited under two motives—
the first that of technology, the second that of ethnology. Wherever the material
is sufficiently abundant, and from a great number of localities, the whole of man-
kind are considered to be of one species, and all objects belonging to a certain class
are assembled and arranged for the purpose of showing their historical elaboration
and their geographic distribution. This is called the technographic series. How-
ever, where there is a large mass of material of great variety from many peoples and
not exclusively collected from any one, the specimens are displayed at present in
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

ethnographic groups and arranged around the hall. There are sections devoted to
Negroid Africa, Caucasian peoples in Africa and Asia, the peoples of eastern Asia,
including Siam, Burma, Japan, Korea, Thibet, and the Ural-alta group.

This arrangement enables the curator to place before the public, at least in its
proper national and geographic connection, desultory material from ali parts of the
world. As regards the American collection, a great change has been proposed—to
set apart. the northwest range for the continent of America, a special exhibit to be
made of the Pueblo region in the northwest court. This plan has only been partly
carried out.

The curator has made a special study during the year of primitive
methods of travel and transportation, and a paper by him on this sub-
ject is printed in the Report for 1894.

Material in the Museum has been lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin,
director of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, University
of Pennsylvania; to Dr. W. J. Hoffman in connection with his studies
of the pictographie work of the Eskimo, and to Mr. J. D. McGuire in
connection with his investigations of stoneworking among savage
peoples. The use of the drill has been thoroughly studied by Mr.
McGuire, and the results are embodied in a very interesting paper
published in the Report for last year. Dr. Boas has prosecuted an
extended study of the Indians of the Northwest Coast, and a valuable
paper by him upon this subject is included in this volume.

The curator has published sevep papers during the year, including a
study of ‘“* North American Bows, Arrows, and Quivers” (printed in the
Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1893). Mr. Walter Hough,
assistant curator, prepared a catalogue of the ethnologica) exhibit dis-
played by the National Museum at the Columbian Historical Exposition
in Madrid, and also a descriptive report upon the ancient Central and
South American pottery exhibited in Madrid on that occasion.

Alluding to the special plans which he has in view, the curator makes
the following statement:

The curator commenced at the end of the fiscal year to make a classified catalogue
of every ethnological specimen in the collection, with regard to its function, mate-
rial, and its location, for the purpose of indicating geographically the poverty of the
department, especially with reference to American material. Jor instance, all the
stocks of the American race, from Point Barrow to Cape Horn, are arranged alpha-
betically and in the order of their location. It is proposed to have a separate sheet or
column connected with these stocks as they occur, devoted to each of the great
typical industries, activities, or apparatus, and to indicate upon these sheets or in these
columns whether or not each stock has in use this method or apparatus. As soon as
this chart is made out, it can be easily ascertained whether any tribe possesses this
or that art, and if the materials and tools connected with the art are not in the

National Museum, it will indicate an intelligent line aleng which collections ought
to be made.

The curator hopes to devote a great deal of attention to this special research dur-
ing the next year and to utilize the resources of the establishment, with the consent
and assistance of the Director, for the purpose of perfecting the series for America.

There have been 1,270 entries made during the year in volumes 35
and 37 of the catalogue of the department. In volume 35 the entries

run from 165855 to 169330, and in volume 37 from 174426 to 175221.
The number of specimens received was 2,642.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85

DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

In his annual report the curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, remarks that
the operations of this year have exceeded those of all previous years
in the number and extent of the accessions as well as in their scientific
value. The most important addition, although not a permanent gift,
was the extensive collection of Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Ga.
It consists of 32,478 specimens from the Etowah mounds and from
Burke and Columbia counties, Ga. The value of this collection consists
chiefly in the opportunity which it affords for a study of the industries
of the aborigines as manifested in their dwellings, burial places, imple-
ments, and utensils. The Nicaraguan Government contributed a valu-
able collection of pottery and stone objects from the exhibit of that
Republic at the Madrid Exposition. Mr. John C. Meyer, of Round Top,
Fayette County, Tex., presented a large series of rude chipped imple-
ments and other objects, including three chipped implements of jasper.
Eleven large pottery vases from Argentina were received from the La
Plata Museum, through the courtesy of Dr. F. P. Moreno. In addi-
tion, the curator makes special mention ot several other accessions, all
of which are included in the Accession List (Appendix II).

Several important changes having become desirable in the arrange-
ment of the entire collection, the curator has devoted himself assiduously
to this work, and the operations incident to the arrangement are
indicated in his own words:

In order to effect this task, it was necessary to rearrange, geographically, all
the objects in 52 cases, according to the various States of the United States and of
foreign countries; also to rearrange the objects made by or belonging to prehistoric
man, contained in12cases. The latter have been arranged in two synoptical series—
chronological and geographical—one representing Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the
other North America. The objects from Mexico, the West Indies, Central America,
and South America were installed in wall cases on the north and west sides of the
hall. All of the Pacific Coast objects were segregated and installed in cases by
themselves, and the mummies were placed in the long wall cases on the south side
of the hall. Two new shelves have been made for each alcove case and 900 specimens
of mound pottery placed thereon. The very large specimens were placed above the
alcove cases, fronting the aisles, thus giving them a decorative, as well as utilitarian,
effect. The prehistoric pottery has been transferred from the Museum building, and
the large glass cases of pottery from Peru, Brazil, and from the Arkansas mounds
have been installed in the foyer of the hall. A large case containing a group of
Indian figures, representing a quarry workshop (?) from Piney Branch, District of
Columbia, has also been setup. A number of paintings, drawings, lithographs, and
photographs of prehistoric objects have been placed on the walls above the cases.
These included a large painting representing the ruins of Spruce Tree House, Mancos
Canyon, Colorado, Major Powell’s map of the linguistic stocks of North America,
and a chronological map adapted to show the distribution of aboriginal mound dis-
tricts in the United States. Two hundred and forty drawers were constructed and
placed in eight sloping-top table cases with frosted glass doors. This work was
completed March 19, and since that time the drawers have been utilized for the
storage of some 3,500 objects belonging to the collection.

The exhibition series is now so installed that every object can be
plainly seen. Labels have been attached to many of the specimens.
86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The curator has commenced a study of prehistoric pipes and smoking
apparatus, and of aboriginal musical instruments. He has also con-
tinued special investigations of paleolithic implements, rude notched
axes, prehistoric copper, jade and cache implements, and prehistoric
Kitrusean objects. A paper by the curator on the history of the sign
of the Swastika has been completed and is printed in the Report for
1894. Various other objects connected with the existence of prehistoric
man in North America have also engaged special attention.

On two occasions specimens from this department were lent for use
in illustrating lectures. The pupils of several schools in the city have
visited the exhibition hall and received instruction from the curator as
to the scope and aims of the exhibit.

Hight papers by the curator, relating chiefly to matters pertaining to
his department, have been published during the year. The following
remarks, bearing upon the special plans which the curator has in view
for the future development of the department, are quoted from his
annual report:

The collections in this department have now increased to 203,520 objects. The
benefit to science of such a collection is by enabling the archeologist and anthro-
pologist to write a history of prehistoric man. In ethnological collections and
objects relating to primitive peoples of modern times, the study of the people’s
habits and customs, and the writing of their history, can be done by the historian
personally visiting the tribes and obtaining his information at first hand. But in
collections relating to prehistoric peoples this can not be done, and we are driven to
a study of the implements, objects, monuments, etc., left by them. The student,
historian, archeologist, and anthropologist compare these objects (1) with each
other, in localities where they have been associated together; (2) with implements
from other localities; (3) he compares one locality with another, and (4) all of them
together with each other—that is, he first establishes, as well as he is able, a unit of
civilization or culture within a given tribe, group, or family; then, by extending his
observations, he establishes other units of culture or civilization in other tribes,
groups, or families, and these units he respectively compares together, first in a
general way, and second, in the details of the implements and objects which go to
make them up.

I propose to make from the specimens in my department such a segregation by
localities; a division, if possible, by time; also an establishment of units of civili-
zation, and thus make the comparison mentioned, or, rather, afford material for stu-
dents either now or hereafter to make this comparison of civilizations. This will
require the services of a draftsman. As no person can by mere words describe the
form of an object, and as the differences of form are, or may be, but slight, and yet
mean much, there is greater necessity for graphic delineation than there would oth-
erwise be. The objects have all been made by hand; there never was any special
pattern for the workman to follow; each man, to a large extent, made every kind of
object, so the differences become more important and the necessity for drawing
greater than it would be under other circumstances. It would not be true to say
there were no type specimens of the objects made by the aboriginal man, because if
he made each one by hazard, as there are a hundred times more implements than
styles, some of them must pattern after the others, and thus some implements have
come to be considered types. But this, I think, is entirely arbitrary, and is the
decision of the modern student rather than the action or intention of the aboriginal
workman. In the endeavor to discover his intention, it is necessary to make draw-

ings enough of the implements to show these types and the differences in their
details.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87

During the year 660 specimens were distributed, principally in
exchange. Many persons who come into possession of stone imple-
ments and are anxious to learn something of their significance send
them to the Museum for examination. In 1895 there were received for
this purpose 38 lots, aggregating 552 specimens. Reports are invaria-
bly transmitted to the senders as soon as the specimens have been
examined, and in most instances the latter are returned.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 169540, and in June,
1895, 172315.

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

At the time when the department of ethnology was established in
the National Museum, there were large accumulations of ethnological
objects from various sources which could not be regarded as purely
ethnic material, not being specially connected with or illustrative of
special tribes of men, but which rather formed parts of series of arts
scattered over the entire earth. Such arts might be regarded as folk
inventions and as illustrating a part of the great scheme of human
invention. It was necessary to find a place for these objects, and sev-
eral special groups, among which they might be properly distributed,
were established. These formed what has since been known as the
* Department of Arts and Industries.” Thus the sections of foods, tex-
tiles, fisheries, naval architecture, travel and transportation, the medi-
cines of all peoples, music, and several others, came into existence. In
them the objects are arranged under different classes of types, accord-
ing to their structure, and in each class the objects are further arranged
according to a system of historic development and elaboration. The
Museum records now show that 14 sections have been organized,
although some of these are still without custodians. These are:
(1) Naval architecture; (2) transportation; (3) textiles; (4) foods and
chemicals; (5) fisheries; (6) animal products; (7) graphie arts; (8) histor-
ical collections, coins, and medals; (9) physical apparatus; (10) musical
instruments; (11) porcelains and bronzes; (12) materia medica; (13)
forestry; (14) oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.

Technological collections.—The first four sections in the enumeration
above have been placed in charge of Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins, who, on
February 1, 1895, was designated “‘ Curator of the technological collec-
tions.” To these, other sections will be added as occasion and oppor-
tunity may arise. The development of these collections will be slow,
inasmuch as objects which were used by man in the foundation of many
of the arts are very difficult to obtain. Again, the bulkiness of
many objects which would be most desirable, would render them, even if
obtainable, too cumbersome for installation, nor could space be assigned
for the installation of such relics, owing to the already crowded condi-
tion of the Museum halls. In cases where large objects can be repre-
sented by models, the curator suggests the construction of small models,
varying from one-fifth to one-tenth natural size where it is desired to
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

show the details of machinery, and from one-twentieth to one-fiftieth
where only form and general proportions need to be considered, as in
the case of buildings, ships, ete. Scale drawings, photographs, or
other representations of objects illustrating the earlier steps in the
epoch-making arts, would be desirable. From them small models can
bemade. These, accompanied by labels containing sketches in outline,
explaining graphically such details as are precluded by the limitations
of a small model, may be made the means of illustrating the history of
the beginnings of the more important American industrial arts. Such
a scheme might at first be thought to duplicate to a certain extent the
work of the Patent Office in that direction. It will be remembered,
however, that the records of that office contain only such documents
and models as have been presented for examination and adjudication
by persons mainly interested in drawing up claims. This would not
interfere with a presentation of the most important epoch-making
inventious, such as Henry’s electromagnetic sound telegraph.

The curator will endeavor to extend the series illustrating the begin-
nings of the steamboat. By the addition of a few models to the pres-
ent collection, the Museum would have a very satisfactory exhibit. He
also has in view the preparation of a case containing models illustrat-
ing presses and machinery relating to the early steps in the art of
printing and paper making.

During the present fiscal year few objects of special importance were
received. Among the most interesting were several pieces of appara-
tus used by Prof. Joseph Henry in his investigations of electromagnet-
ism, which led to the invention of the magnetic telegraph. These had
for many years been preserved in the Smithsonian building, but have
now been placed on exhibition with other pieces of apparatus used by
Professor Henry and deposited in the Museum by his daughters. A
special case is devoted to perpetuating the history of the important
discoveries in electricity which he made. A model of his first electro-
magnetic sound telegraph apparatus, made by John Sehultzbach, of
Washington, under Mr. Watkins’s supervision, has been added to the
collection, and other models, prepared for exhibition at the Atlanta
Exposition, will be installed in the Museum at its close. The curator
has not yet had an opportunity to rearrange the collection of models of
vessels. Capt. J. W. Collins, who was formerly in charge of this col-
lection, has, since his resignation, been employed by the Museum to
prepare a full descriptive catalogue which will serve as a history of
naval architecture as illustrated by the models and other objects in the
Museum. This work was commenced on April 1. With a view to
maturing plans for a systematic rearrangement, a model of the exhibi-
tion hall devoted to naval architecture has been made, and also rough
models of all the boats suspended from the roof. The work of rear-
rangement will be advanced as soon as the necessary supports are in
place. Many of the boats were taken down, cleaned, and measured

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89

preparatory to their being described by Captain Collins in the cata-
logue already alluded to. On account of the limited space available
for purposes of exhibition, the collections showing the various stages
of development in the sewing machine and the typewriting machine,
have been placed in storage.

Mr. Watkins has devoted considerable study to the evolution of the
various methods of transportation, and, referring to this subject in his
annual report, he says:

During such time as was not consumed by other duties during April, May, and
June, 1895, I continued the investigations (which I have been engaged in for several
years) of the circumstances which led to the final improvement in the wheel and
the other mechanical devices which have tendered the attainment of high speeds
possible in the art of transportation on land and water, which have proven such an
important factor in modern civilization. The results of these investigations are
embodied in the models prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, the drawings for which,
together with the superintendence of their construction and the preparation of
labels, have consumed much time. Each of the labels for the models illustrating
land conveyance contains, in addition to a brief printed description, a smali sketch
which gives more information at a glance than could be conveyed to the average
museum visitor by many printed words. Itis my belief that this same idea, extended
and modified by the duplication of these sketches by some photomechanical pro-
cess, may be made extremely useful, not only in connection with museum specimens
on exhibition, but for permanent record in catalogues and elsewhere. A series of
these illustrated labels, properly arranged, can with a few additions be made to
form an illustrated handbook of the collection.

It is proper to make special mention of the assistance rendered by
Dr. Francis B. Stevens, of Hoboken, N. J., whose aid in preparing the
drawings for the machinery of the models illustrating the early history
of the steamboat has been invaluable.

In this connection Mr. Watkins adds:

Dr. Stevens, a distinguished engineer, now in the eighty-third year of his age,
has acquired by observation and practice a fund of information concerning early
mechanical history in America of the greatest importance. To have been able to
act as the medium for preserving this history through the collections in the U.S.
National Museum, I regard as a great privilege.

The help extended by Mr. George C. Maynard in obtaining for the
Museum relics and other objects desirable for the collections is also very
highly appreciated. Mr. Maynard is associated with several societies
which were organized for the purpose of preserving the history of elec-
trical and mechanical inventions in general.

In the general catalogue only six entries have been made during the
year, the last number being 191200. The objects pertaining to naval
architecture are entered in a separate catalogue book, which is now, as
above indicated, being prepared by Captain Collins. Other books are
kept for the entry of accessions to the collections of textiles, foods, and
chemicals.

The graphic arts coilection.—The absence of the curator in Europe
during the last halfof the fiscal year (January to June) has curtailed the
operations of the department, and the following remarks have reference
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

therefore to what was accomplished during the first six months of the
year (July 1 to December 31, 1894).

The principal contributors of specimens were Mr. N. S. Amstutz,
Cleveland, Ohio; Mr. J. M. Falconer, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Mr. J.W. Osborne,
Washington, D. C.; the United States Geological Survey, and Mr. W,
W. Wallingford, Washington, D.C. The entry of the accessions took
up 61 catalogue numbers (5501-5561). The most interesting of these
are 44 specimens illustrating the transmission of photographs by means
of electricity. They were contributed by Mr. N.S. Amstutz, the inventor
of the process. A photomechanical color-print was purchased from the
United States Aluminum Printing Plate Company, New York, and a
book containing chromolithographs was obtained in exchange. The
duplicates, which are not included in the above total, have been sepa-
rated. <A catalogue of the specimens on exhibition has been prepared,
and also a card catalogue of the whole collection. This is arranged by
technical divisions, preliminary to a more systematic arraugement
later on.

Materia medica.—This collection is again under the charge of Dr.
James M. Flint, U.S. N., who resumed his connection with the Museum
May 24,1895. For several years the collection has been practically
camplete, and little remains to be done except to replace specimens
from time to time with fresh material and to substitute new labels for
old. Only five specimens were received during the year. These were
recorded under catalogue numbers 142309 to 142513, which is the last
entry of the year.

The historical collections.—There is a continually increasing interest
shown in objects relating to the history of the United States during the
colonial and Revolutionary periods. If sufficient exhibition space were
available, the material already on hand would permit a very interesting
and fairly complete exhibit in these directions, but unfortunately it is
impossible under the circumstances to provide room for more than
a limited number of objects, consisting chiefly of personal relics of
illustrious statesmen and soldiers.

The most interesting addition to the collections during the year con-
sists of a number of utensils and objects of wearing apparel used in
New England during colonial times. They illustrate in a very satisfae-
tory manner the customs and costumes of the seventeenth and eight-
eenth centuries. The donor is Mr. John B. Copp, Old Mystic, Conn.
Among other accessions are: A sword belt presented to Admiral 8. D.
Trenchard by the Government of Great Britain for his services in res-
cuing the officers and crew of the British bark Adiew off Cape Ann,
Massachusetts, in August, 1856; an old Spanish sword of the kind
used by the Conquistadores in Santo Domingo; a sword from Puerto
Rico bearing the date 1796; early Spanish spurs from Argentina and
San Domingo; a collection of early Spanish-Mexican copper and silver
coins; a cabinet containing 102 plaster casts of historic medals and

cameos, presented by Rev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain; a waistcoat supposed
to have belonged to Gen. George Washington, deposited by Mrs. J. A.
Rodgers, South Bethlehem, Pa.; a canteen carried through the Revolu-
tionary war by John Paulding, one of the captors of Major André,
deposited by Gen. Rk. W. Meade; a collection of South Carolina colo-
nial paper money, and another of silver, nickel, and copper coins of
Mexico, Danish West Indies, Great Britain, and Switzerland, received
from Mr, A. W. Carey, Adrian, Mich.; a sword and epaulets worn by
Capt. Seth Britt Thornton, U. S. A., at Contreras during the last
attack on the City of Mexico; decorations and papers of the late Joseph
Smolinski, commander of the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Medjidish,
Chevalier of the Polish Military Cross, ete., deposited by his son Joseph
Smolinski, of Washington, D. C., and a model of the Behaim globe,
the original of which was made at Nuremburg in 1487.

In all, 298 specimens were added to the collection during the year.

Collection of musical instruments.—For reasons explained in previous
reports, no attempt has yet been made to permanently install this col-
lection, which is now one of the largest in the world. A considerable
number of instruments were obtained from several foreign exhibits at
the World’s Columbian Exposition, and these have been catalogued
and either installed in the long wall cases on the east and west sides of
the north hall or have been placed in storage.

No accessions of special value have been received during the year.
Mention may be made, however, of 2 instruments from Ceylon and 5
from Johore, Malay Peninsula, purchased from the Field Columbian
Museum; a native lyre from Congo, Africa, received from Mr. J. H.
Camp; a Japanese vertical flute, a transverse flute, and a double whistle
from Mr. Simon A. Stern, of Philadelphia, Pa.; a vertical flute from
New Hebrides, a horn from Friesland, Holland, a virginal made in 1602
and a Broadwood piano, from Mrs. J. Crosby Brown; a wooden bell, or
logo, from Mr. H. J. Moors, of Apia, Samoa; a flageolet and an oboe
from Tibet, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott; a guirro (a sort of whistle),
from Puerto Rico, and a tiple (a small guitar), from the same locality,
presented by Mrs. Charles B. Smith, of Washington, D. C.

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.—
These collections are the outgrowth of the establishment of a section of
the department of arts and industries in 1888, under the honorary
curatorship of Dr. Paul Haupt, of the Johns Hopkins University, for
the accumulation and preservation of objects illustrating oriental anti-
quities and ceremonials connected with religious worship of all kinds.
Dr. Cyrus Adler, librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, is in charge
of these collections, and under his immediate care they have been
arranged. They now occupy four alcoves in the east and west halls, near
the rotunda. The north alcove in the east hall contains the Egyptian col-
lections, arranged in eight cases. The Assyro-Babylonian collections
are in the south alcove in the same hall, also arranged in eight cases.
92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In the north alcove of the west ball are the Jewish, Mohammedan, and
Greco-Roman religious collections, while in the south alcove, opposite,
are arranged the religious objects relating to Brahmanism, Buddhism,
and Shintoism.

The principal additions during the year were a Siamese edition of
the sacred writings of the Southern Buddhists, presented by the King
of Siam; the liturgy of the Bene Israel of Bombay in the Maratha lan-
guage, presented by Rev. Henry Cohen, Galveston, Tex., and a Jap-
anese temple drum, deposited by Dr. G. Brown Goode. The Museum
is also indebted to Mr. R. Dorsey Mohun, United States consul at Zan-
zibar, for copies of the Koran, a Koran stand, and prayer mats, and to

tev. Henry Cchen for four volumes of Jewish liturgy.

Casts of the Temple stone, Siloam inscription, and twelve Assyrian
seals were sent to Rey. C. C. Newton, Tokyo, Japan, in exchange for
Buddhistie and Shinto objects.

Much progress has been made in the installation of the objects now
on exhibition. This matter is referred to more in detail in the chapter
entitled ‘‘The development and arrangement of the exhibition series.”
All of the collections not on exhibition have been rearranged and put
in storage cases. The molds and casts have been placed in the base-
ment of the Smithsonian building, where they are safe and easily
accessible,

Dr. Adler has commenced a study of Jewish ceremonial institutions.
He has also continued his study of ancient oriental seals, and in this
work has had the opportunity of examining a large collection of seals
belonging to Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. Casts were made
of 82 of these specimens. He has also completed a paper on the ‘“Cot-
ton Grotto near Jerusalem and ancient Methods of Quarrying.” This
is based partly on objects which he has presented to the Museum.

It is Dr. Adler’s desire to gather a collection of Hittite casts and a
series of amulets.

During the year 171 specimens were received. The entries in the
catalogue were contained between numbers 154816 and 154990.

IV.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENTS.

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES, AND ACCOUNTS.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk, presents, in his annual report, a detailed
statement showing the amount of the appropriations for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1835, and the disbursements thereunder; also the dis-
position of the unexpended balances remaining on hand from the
appropriations of previous years. These statements are printed in
Appendix VIt.

The work pertaining to the accounts connected with the disburse-
ment of the funds allotted to the National Museum, for an exhibit at
the Cotton States aud International Exposition at Atlanta, has entailed
considerable extra work upon the force of this office during the present
year. This work, however, as well as the preparation of orders for
materials and labor, has been performed without any additional help.

In the early part of the fiscal year steps were taken with a view to
bringing suit against persons who declined to enter into contracts
which had been awarded them for furnishing supplies, ete. ‘The opinion
of the Attorney-General was sought, and although the Smithsonian
Institution has not up to this time been recognized as being entitled to
this privilege, the action taken resulted in suits being brought against
the defaulters by the Department of Justice.

A board was appointed August 15, 1894, to examine and report upon
the safety of the alcohol and alcoholic specimens stored in the base-
ment of the Smithsonian building. Additional safeguards were recom.
mended, and these have been provided.

A new telephone service, with metallic circuits and long-distance
instruments, was installed during the year, and although the service is
much improved, the annual rental charged is less than that formerly
paid.

The chief clerk states that the rules adopted last year for the govern-
ment of the watch force have been adhered to, and that as a result the
force has been brought to a higher state of efficiency.

The committee appointed to consider the subject of an improved sys-
tem of locks for the Museum cases, submitted its report at the close of
the preceding fiscal year, and during the present year preliminary steps
have been taken with a view to carrying out the recommendations made.

93
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The quarters occupied for storage having been found too small for the
purpose, a new building was leased on the 15th of June of the present
year, and the transfer made a short time thereafter.

In February, 1895, an order was issued defining more particularly the
duties of the engineer.

The chief clerk makes a statement in his report regarding the records
of his office, from which the following is taken:

The originals of all requisitions for purchases, etc., are bound into
volumes of convenient size, for ready reference. A record is kept of all
bills and vouchers for expenditures on account of appropriations, and
every such bill or voucher has a reference to the number of the requisi-
tion authorizing the expenditure. Applications for leaves of absence
are filed in this office, and a record is kept of those granted, also of all
matters pertaining to the personnel of the Museum, except applications
for employment, which, after receiving proper action, are filed in the
office of the Secretary. Applications for the use of the lecture hall and
the stereopticon are also duly recorded. The files of the office contain
letters on all subjects pertaining to administrative and financial mat-
ters. Letters and documents of all kinds are given a distinctive num-
ber, and the letters are carefully indexed under the name of the writer
and the subject, the card system being used. When two or more let-
ters relate to one subject, they are given the same number and are filed
together. It is intended eventually to enter upon the card catalogue
all letters contained in the press-copy books, as well as those received
and filed. One series of press-copy books contains letters relating to
general Museum business, another contains letters pertaining to the
personnel of the Museum, and in still another series are copied letters
addressed to the Secretary, transmitting vouchers for payment. There
is in this office, also, a record of all legislative matters relating to the
Museum, and complete sets of books of estimates, digests of laws, ete.

DIVISION OF CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This branch of the administrative work remains under the charge of
Mr. R. I. Geare. The force is practically the same as last year,
although the occasions upon which it has been necessary to call upon
this office for assistance in matters outside of its own work have been
much more numerous than in any previous year. There has been an
increase of over 1,000 in the number of letters and other official papers
prepared for signature, compared with the preceding year.

A special feature of the correspondence has been in the direction of
obtaining accessions to the library of the National Museum. Special
circular letters were prepared and invitations extended to the State
universities, agricultural colleges, and experiment stations, as well as
to a number of foreign institutions and scientific societies, to exchange
publications with the Museum or to complete partial sets already in
the library. The result of the correspondence has been very grati-
fying.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 95

e

Circulars have been prepared for transmission to specialists receiving
the Museum publications requesting them to send their own writings
in exchange, and at the same time inquiring whether our sendings are
regularly received, whether they are properly directed, and whether
the continuance of their transmission is desired. This information
will be of value in revising the mailing lists. It has been thought
inadvisable to distribute the circular until it shall be determined
beyond doubt what number of individuals and institutions ean with
certainty be retained upon the lists. This can not be definitely settled
until it shall be seen whether Congress is willing to remove the restric-
tion imposed in the printing act of January 12, 1895, limiting the
edition of the Proceedings and Bulletin to 1,000 copies, or one-third of
the customary number.

Among the numerous records kept in this division, those of greatest
importance in connection with the work of the office are as follows:

Two ecard catalogues showing the course of letters received at the
Museum—one, of letters coming to the Museum direct or by reference
from some other departinent or bureau of the Government; the other,
of letters referred to the Museum by the Smithsonian Institution. For
the more important letters received from the Institution, a separate
register is kept by numbers.

In connection with the press-copying of official papers there are ten
separate classes of books in constant use, besides several groups of
books containing the correspondence relating to expositions, congresses,
and other public functions in which the Museum has participated. In
addition to the index which each book contains, a general index in the
form of a card catalogue is kept. On each ecard or group of cards is
summarized the entire correspondence with each individual or institu-
tion. This catalogue, which is estimated to contain at least 35,000
cards, is one of the most valuable records of the office. On it the names
of correspondents, as well as of persons whose names occur in the cor-
respondence, are arranged alphabetically. A supplementary catalogue
of the names and addresses of foreign correspondents, arranged geo-
graphically, is also preserved.

A separate record is kept of the acknowledgments of material
acquired by the Museum, of reports upon objects sent to the Museum
for identification, and of the transmission of material to institutions
and to individuals for purposes of study; and, in addition, a record of
the-transmission of material to specialists for determination, as well as
of exchanges with museums in foreign countries and with individuals.
The results of cooperation with the Museum in special directions, on
the part of the Executive Departments and bureaus of the Government,
are also recorded.

The accession catalogue contains the name and address of each
contributor, together with a detailed statement of the nature of the
material received, and other useful information, such as the date of
entry, the number assigned, etc. The record of material sent to the
96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Museum for examination and report is similar in scope. These records
are published each year in the Annual Report. During the present
yer a separaterecord has been kept of material received for exhibition
at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta.

The correspondence with educational institutions regarding the dis-
tribution of collections forms the subject of a special catalogue. The
cards in this catalogue are arranged alphabetically by States and sub-
alphabetically by cities and towns. A short abstract is given of the
contents of each communication received from applicants for collee-
tions, and also of each letter sent out from the Museum. All applica-
tions for specimens are also entered in chronological order upon a
separate register.

The records relating to the distribution of Museum publications are
quite voluminous. The mailing lists are classified as follows: (1) the
list of domestic and foreign libraries which receive the Museum
teports, Proceedings, and Bulletins (embracing about 2,500 names);
(2) the list of foreign correspondents receiving the Museum Report
(embracing about 2,000 names), and (5) the lists of individuals and insti-
tutions receiving publications upon one or more special subjects
(embracing in all about 3,000 names). Card catalogues corresponding
to these lists are preserved. Upon the catalogues corresponding to
the first two is recorded, in convenient form, information regarding
the relations of the Museum with the libraries and institutions listed.
The lists referred to under the third heading consist of the names of
the recipients of the Reports, Proceedings volumes, and Bulletins, and
of separate papers from the Proceedings and Reports; also of the
names of specialists receiving papers upon one or more of a variety of
subjects. Hach list has its corresponding card catalogue. A separate
record is kept showing to which lists each publication of the Museum
has been distributed. In the case of publications sent in compliance
with individual requests, the orders are copied in press-copy books
kept for that purpose.

Typewritten lists of the papers published in the Proceedings,
arranged (1) by serial number, (2) alphabetically under the name of
the author, and (3) according to subject-matter, have been prepared,
and are of great importance in responding to the requests of appli-
ants for papers on various subjects. A separate list has also been
prepared referring under (1) name of author, (2) subject, and (3)
locality to all zoological, paleontological, botanical, geological, and
anthropological papers published by the Smithsonian Institution and
its various branches. This is found very useful in connection with
the Museum correspondence.

All letters relating to Museum matters, with the exception of those
bearing upon the finances and personnel of the Museum, are filed in
this office. A series of special files, arranged separately, is also kept
(1) for letters received trom the various departments and bureaus of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. bs L

the Government, (2) for letters received from officials of the Museuin,
(3) tor reports of the scientific and administrative officers of the
Museum, (4) for cross-references to letters from institutions and estab-
lishments, (5) for letters relating to explorations in the results of which
the Museum expects to participate.

By means of card catalogues are also recorded references to all let-
ters containing unaccepted offers to present, deposit, exchange, or sell
specimens to the Museum. This record has been found very useful
in supplying information to curators who may at any future time
be desirous of obtaining material which for some reason could not be
accepted at the time it was offered.

Distribution of publications.—The transmissions of publications to
applicants making special request by letter have surpassed in number
those of any preceding year, and it is safe to say that the regular and
special sendings have aggregated upward of 35,000 publications,
including volumes and separate papers.

Much attention has been given to the revision of the mailing lists.
Record of the date of publication of each volume and pamphlet issued
has been maintained, and is of frequent service for reference, as is also
the catalogue record of lists of specialists to whom publications have
been mailed.

By direction of the Secretary of the Institution, a copy of each pub-
lication, as soon as issued, 1s mailed to publishing houses representing
the Institution as agents in London, Paris, Berlin, Leipsic, and Milan.

The innovations mentioned in the report for the preceding fiscal
year, especially regarding the distribution of publications direct from
this office, have proved satisfactory. The regular distributions to the
persons on the permanent lists are still made from the document room.
The special sendings forwarded from this office are recorded on slips
printed for the purpose, with the name of the person or institution
supplied, the address, the serial number of the publication, and the
date of mailing. When the sending comprises both Smithsonian and
Museum publications, the package is transmitted from the Smithsonian
building, and a slip is filled out similarly to the above, with the addi-
tion of the name of the person upon whose recommendation the send-
ingismade. These slips are press-copied in books reserved exclusively
for this purpose, and constitute a permanent record.

More than 4,000 labels have been written in connection with the
distribution of the Smithsonian allotment of the Museum Reports for
1891 and 1892 to institutions in the United States and abroad.

The Museum Report for 1892, Bulletin 48, and Circulars 45, 44, 45,
and 46 were issued during the year. Proceedings papers Nos. 951-1031
were distributed in pamphlet form, and also advance sheets of Nos. 1040
and 1041.

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.

The data concerning these branches of the administrative work are
taken from the report of the registrar, Mr. 8. C. Brown.

There were received during the year 30,511 packages of all kinds,
including material for addition to the collections, publications, and sup-
plies. These figures, as compared with those for the preceding year,
show a decrease of about 19,000. This decrease is readily accounted
for, however, when it is remembered that during the fiscal year 1893-94
the material returned from the World’s Columbian Exposition was
received and entered. There were 2,791 packages sent out, of which
694 contained specimens transmitted to educational establishments as
gifts, or sent to individuals or institutions in exchange, or for study.
A few specimens returned to owners are also included in this number.
The entries made on the incoming transportation record numbered
2,664, and on the outgoing transportation record, 719.

The number of accessions or lots of material received was 1,223, an
increase of 62 over the record for the preceding year. There were 467
“temporary” accessions, consisting of material received for identifica-
tion. An increase of over 12,000 is noted in the number of specimens
distributed, the total for the year having been 39,236.

The storage record shows that 554 packages were placed in storage,
while 113 packages were withdrawn by the curators to whose depart-
ments the material belonged. The storage rooms having become very
much crowded, it was found necessary to make arrangements for addi-
tional space, and in June, 1895, new quarters were secured, containing
more than double the floor space and three times the cubic capacity of
the quarters previously occupied.

Of the collections transmitted to educational establishments during
the year, a large proportion consisted of marine invertebrates, although
many specimens of rocks and ores, and casts of prehistoric implements
have been sent out, as well as a jimited number of minerals and fishes.
Lists of the specimens contained in the collections which have been
prepared for distribution since 1890 are printed in Appendix IX.

A detailed statement, arranged geographically, showing to what indi-
viduals and institutions specimens have been sent during the year,
either in exchange, as gifts, or for study, is given in Appendix x. The
number of lots of specimens sent out is here recorded:

The thanks of the National Museum are due to Messrs. George
Christall & Co., agents of the Trinidad Line of Steamers, for courtesies
extended in offering to transport collecting outfits and specimens to
and from Trinidad free of charge.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR; POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The superintendent of buildings, Mr. Henry Horan, mentions in his
annual report the more important features of the work accomplished
during the year by the force under his charge. An abstract of this
portion of his report is given in Appendix x1. Mr. Horan has also
submitted a statement showing the number of cases, fixtures, ete.,
made, altered, or repaired, the amount of fuel, gas, and ice consumed,
a list of articles lost and found in the Museum halls, lists of the tools
in use in the various shops, and a table showing the number of feet of |
telephone and other electric wire installed.

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.
TAXIDERMISTS.

Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, reports that the following
mammals were mounted during the year, but owing to pressure of other
work were not emtirely finished: A Texas hare, a marsh hare, an Angora

goat, a Japanese goat, two guinea pigs, and a few other small mammais.
A limited number of mounted specimens, including the head of a water
buffalo, a pangolin, a flying squirrel, and a mole rat, were repaired and
put on new stands.

All mammals dying from the effects of confinement at the National
Zoological Park are now received by the taxidermist and by him turned
over to the osteological preparator or to the department of birds, rep-
tiles, or mammals, as the ease may be. The total number of mammals
received in the flesh during the year was 84, nearly one-half having
come from the Zoological Park, as will be seen from the following table:

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 101

Mr. William Palmer spent a portion of the months of February and
March in making collections in the Kissimmee River region of Florida.

A model of the Tower of Babel was prepared by Mr. Joseph Palmer
for exhibition at the Atlanta Iixposition in connection with the exhibit
of the department of oriental antiquities under the direction of Dr. Cyrus
Adler. He was also occupied in assisting in the preparation of lay
figures and of exhibits of reptiles and birds.

Casts were made of a collection of 318 Assyrian seals, transmitted
by Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. A large number of casts
of cetaceans were cleaned and repaired, and the contents of the rooms
in the basement of the Smithsonian building in which the molds are
stored, were thoroughly overhauled. All of the tanks and pickled
skins were removed from the shed near the Fish Commission building
to one of the sheds south of the Smithsonian building. The location
of the quarters rented for storage purposes and for workrooms was
changed near the ciose of the year.

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Leland Stanford Junior University, and
Mr. Meklroy, of Washington, spent several weeks in the shops of the
taxidermists, studying the methods of work.

Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned
and renovated about 4,000 specimens in the exhibition series during
the year. He also skinned 225 alcoholic birds and dismounted about
150 specimens. Forty-two fresh specimens were skinned and about
50 specimens were mounted for the exhibition series.

OSTEOLOGIST.

The osteological work has consisted mainly in the preparation of
material for the study series. Although a number of specimens have
been prepared for exhibition, it has been impossible, owing to pressure
of other work, to mount more than a small portion of them. The work of
preparing a restoration of a skeleton of Zeuglodon for the Cotton States
and International Exposition at Atlanta interfered greatly with the
regular work of the osteoiogist. Three months of the timeof Mr. J. W.
Scollick were spent in developing portions of the skeleton on which the
restoration was based.

Hight hundred and eighty-one skulls were cleaned for the depart-
ment of mammals, and a considerable amount of time was spent in pre-
paring specimens for the use of Professor Cope in connection with the
preparation of a work on the reptilia of North America.

PHOTOGRAPHER.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer, reports that 759 negatives were
made during the year, also 227 platinum prints, 1,231 silver prints, 25
ceyanotype prints, 10 bromide enlargements, and 6 lantern slides.
Twenty-nine prints were mounted. <A large portion of this work was
done for the departments of ethnology, prehistoric anthropology,
botany, mammals, geology, and marine invertebrates. The care of the
photographie collection and other work of a miscellaneous character,
including the testing of a number of different kinds of ink, in order to
determine the most suitable for the use of the Museum, occupied con-
siderable time.

COLORIST.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler continued the work of cleaning and restoring
some of the pictures contained in the Catlin collection of Indian paint-
ings. About one hundred of these have received attention up to the
present time. He also continued his work on the series of paintings
representing the races of man. Some miscellaneous work was accom-
plished, including the painting of lay figures for the department of
ethnology, and the retouching of a series of photographs of Pembroke
College, England.
