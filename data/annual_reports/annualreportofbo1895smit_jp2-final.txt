UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U.S. National Museum.

I.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

By act of Congress passed in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution became
the only lawful place of deposit for ‘all objects of art and of foreign
and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants, and
geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States.”
These collections have served as a nucleus for the National Museum
of the United States. For many years this Museum was supported
entirely at the expense of the Smithson fund, and a considerable por-
tion of the collections is the property of the Institution through gift or
purchase.

A “museum” has been defined by Professor Huxley as ‘‘ a consultative
library of objects.” Not only is the National Museum such a consulta-
tive library, but it is an agency for the instruction of the people of the
wholecountry. It keepsin mind the needs of those whose lives are not
occupied in the study of science, as well as of the teacher and the skilled
investigator. Its benefits are extended without cost or reserve to hun-
dreds of thousands of visitors from all parts of the United States who
enter its halls every year,and through the distribution of the duplicate
specimens in the Museum, made up into sets and accurately named, to
public institutions in all parts of the country.

Among the most important features of the operations of the Museum
during the year may be mentioned the reorganization of the exhibits in
several of the departments, notably in the departments of mammals
and prehistoric anthropology. Entire rearrangement of these collec.
tions has been effected, with a very gratifying result.

A large number of the curators have been necessarily engaged in the
preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition. This work has, of

course, interfered seriously with the realization of the plans previously
laid out by them for the development of their respective departments.
Several curators were absent from the Museum for a considerable
portion of the year. Two were detailed by the Museum to cooperate
with the United States Fish Commission in certain special investiga-
tions of aquatic life off the coast of Alaska, and others were absent
in the field for several months.

A.—ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the origin and development of the Museum has been
detailed in previous reports, and was made the special subject of a
paper entitled ‘‘The Genesis of the National Museum.”' For our pres-
ent purpose it will suffice to repeat a few of the most essential facts as
there stated.

The formation of a national museum in the city of Tiactineion was
first undertaken by a society organized in 1840, called ‘The National
Institution,” and afterwards “The National Institute,” which was for
four years exceedingly prosperous and active. The nucleus for a
national museum was gathered by this society in the Patent Office
building in Washington, and public opinion was educated to consider
the establishment of such an institution worthy of the attention of the
Government of the United States. In 1846, having failed in securing
the public recognition at which it aimed, the society became inactive,
and eventually, in 1861, passed out of existence. In the meantime the
Smithsonian Institution had been organized, but from 1844 until 1858,
when the so-called “‘ National Academy of Curiosities ” passed into the
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the term ‘‘ National Museum”
was not in use. From that time onward it was used, unofficially, to
designate the collections in the Smithsonian building.

In January, 1847, the first Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, after many weeks of consultation and deliberation over the
plans for organization, unanimously voted the following resolution:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with
the design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes
of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens
and objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a
library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the
end that a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be pro-
vided, which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall
assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to
the pursuit of any branch of knowledge.?

After the “national cabinet” had been delivered to the Regents,
annual appropriations were made by Congress for its maintenance.
During the iy eauyanree years which followed, the collections were

greatly increased and were made the basis of numerous important
memoirs upon the natural history and ethnology of America. The
public halls, with their arrangements for the exhibition of a portion of
the collection, also received a due share of attention, and a certain
amount of instruction and pleasure was afforded to visitors. The
appropriations, however, were meager, the space limited, and the staff
was so inadequate that little could be done except to keep the collee-
tions in good preservation.

The broad plan upon which the operations of the National Museum
are now conducted was anticipated as early as 1853, when Professor
Henry wrote:

There can be little doubt that in due time ample provision will be made for a
library and museum at the capital of this Union worthy of a Government whose
perpetuity depends upon the virtue and intelligence of the people.!

The difficulties attending the formation of such a museum were
appreciated by him, and in his report for 1849 he spoke with much
emphasis of the difficulties attending the assuming by the Institution
of the care of the national collections, and in the report of the Institu-
tion for 1870” he again carefully expressed his opinion as to the aims
proper to such a museum.

There is [he wrote| scarcely any subject connected with science and
education to which more attention is given at the present day than
that of collections of objects of nature and art known under the gen-
eral denomination of museums. This arises from their growing impor-
tance as aids to scientific investigation and instruction.

In the report for 1873° allusion was made to the increase in the
national collections, even then very great, “requiring the utmost exer-
tions of the limited force connected with the National Museum for its
proper treatment.”

Although the appropriations for the Museum have of late years been
mcre liberal, it is certain that, on account of the immense annual
increase in the quantity of material received, quite as much caution as
ever is still needed in the development of its plans for the future.

The Smithsonian Institution from its foundation fostered explora-
tions, and its museum was enriched by the numerous ethnological
and natural history objects brought home by the explorers. Many
gifts were received from private sources, and valuable objects were
deposited in its Museum for safe-keeping. The nucleus of its collec-
tions was a small but valuable cabinet of minerals formed by the
founder, James Smithson, who was himself a chemist and mineralogist
of high repute, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.

At the time of the establishment of the Institution several naval
expeditions and surveys of the public domain were being organized by

the Government, and during their progress large collections of ethno-
logical and natural history objects were made. Important foreign
material was obtained by the Pacific Exploring Expedition, Perry’s
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions, while the naturalists
attached to the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Boundary Sur-
vey, and the surveys under the Army Engineer Corps, brought together
great collections illustrating the natural resources and ethnology of
North America.

A new source of growth, subsequent to 1871, was the exploration of
the waters of North America by the United States Fish Commission.
The great collections of all forms of aquatic life made by the Commission
found their way gradually into the National Museum, to be placed beside
the collections of other bureaus of the Government engaged in scientific
work.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 the exhibits of the
United States Government and those of numerous foreign governments
and of private exhibitors came to the National Museum.

A new period now began. The storage rooms and exhibition halls of
the Smithsonian building were already overflowing with the accumula-
tions of thirty years, and the small number of persons employed in caring
for them were overburdened and unable properly to perform the requisite
work. The limits of the collections had become wider, and a new and
broader classification was found to be necessary. The growth of the
country in wealth and culture had led to the establishment of many
local museums, and the educational influences flowing from these and
from the Centennial Exhibition caused a demand for more efficient
methods of museum administration. The exhibition of 1876 had been
indeed an event of great educational importance to the people of-the
United States; and not the least of its good works was the lesson it
taught as to the possibilities for good in public museums.

The objects which at the close of the Centennial Exhibition were
given to the United States for its National Museum were of large intrin-
sic value, and were also very important from the fact that the necessity
of caring for them led to the erection of a large building for the expansion
of the Museum itself.

In the early years Professor Baird, then assistant secretary of the
Institution, with two or three assistants, had been able to give all nec-
essary attention to the care of the collections, and the Museum had
never been formally divided into departments. When the reorganiza-
tion was made in 1881, under the immediate care of the present Assist-
ant Secretary, the diversity of the collections made it necessary to
establish a number of departments, each of which was placed in charge
of a curator.

There are now 28 organized departinents and sections in the Museum,
the larger number of which are in charge of specialists who receive no
salary from the Museum. There are also 7 administrative offices.

SPECIAL EPOCHS IN THE HISTORY OF THE MUSEUM.

The history of the National Museum may be divided into three
periods:

First, the period from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution
to 1857, during which time specimens were collected solely to serve as
materials for research. No special effort was made to exhibit them to
the public or to utilize them, except as a foundation for scientific
description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the institution assumed the cus.
tody of the “National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this
period the Museum became a place of deposit for scientific collections
which had already been studied, these collections, so far as convenient,
being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable, made to serve
an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the
Museum has undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering
collections and exhibiting them on account of their value from an
educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scien-
tific research; in the second, the establishment became a museum of
record as well as of research; while in the third period has been added
the idea of public education. The three ideas—record, research, and
education—cooperative and mutually helpful as they are, are essential
to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all,

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material founda-
tions of an enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of
numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those
materials that have served as a foundation for the reports upon the
resources of the United States.

It is @ museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in
the highest degree as a stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scien-
tific investigation. Research is necessary in order to identify and group
the objects in the most philosophical and instructive relations, and its
officers are therefore selected for their ability as investigators, as well
as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by
specimens every kind of natural object and every manifestation of
human thought and activity, of displaying descriptive labels adapted
to the popular mind, and of distributing its publications and its named
series of duplicates.

In conclusion let us review what seems to have been definitely accom-
plished since the time of reorganization in 18381.

The definite steps of progress may be summarized as follows:

(1) An organization of the Museum staff has been effected, efficient
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

for present purposes and capable of expansion and extension as occa-
sion may require, and many capable museum experts have been trained
for work in other institutions.

(2) Through the agency of this staff the materials in the Museum,
the accumulations of nearly half a century, have been examined, classi-
fied, and brought under control and arranged in such manner as to
insure their safety and make them available for study.

(3) The collections have been increased nearly seventeen fold during
the last fourteen years.

(4) A considerable beginning has been made toward the development
of a well-labeled and effectually installed exhibition series, available
for the instruction of the pubhe.

(5) A thorough study of the organization and systems of classifica-
tion in other museums throughout the world has been made, the results
of which are beginning to appear in the work of the Museum staff and
which will be made available for other institutions from time to time
through the publications of the Museum.

(6) Many new methods of installation have been developed by experi-
ment in the Museum, and the best and most available employed else-
where have been adopted. Our new methods are being applied in
many sunilar establishments at home and abroad.

(7) The art of taxidermy and the making of museum models has been
advanced and dignified by the policy adopted in the treatment of the
experts in the employ of the Museum.

8) Science has been forwarded by the publication of some thousands
of papers describing the materials in the Museum, while the work of
specialists in the production of these papers has greatiy enhanced the
value of the national collections.

(9) Popular educational work of unquestioned value has been accom-
plished by participation in the great expositions in Philadelphia, Berlin,
London, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Louisville, Madrid, and Chicago.

(10) Hundreds of thousands of named specimens have been distrib-
uted to other museums and to colleges and schools.

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.

That the United States must have a National Museum worthy of the
dignity of the nation is self-evident.

Every country has a museum or group of museums in its capital
city—centers of scientific and educational activity—the treasure-house
of the people, filled with memorials of national triumphs in the fields of
science, art, and industrial progress.!

These are legitimate objects of national pride, for upon the character
of its museum and UTE ee persone, visiting a country, very

and triumphs, but our country has no need or desire to enter into this field of work.

properly base their judgment as to the nature and degree of the civili-
zation of the people.

Washington may without question be made the seat of one of the
greatest museums in the world. It may perhaps be neither practicable
nor desirable to gather together in this city extensive collections of
ancient medieval art, but a representative series of such objects will
undoubtedly grow up which will tend to educate the public. taste,
promote the study of the elements of art and the history of civiliza-
tion, and forward the arts of design. This having been accomplished,
attention should be directed mainly toward the exhibition of the geol-
ogy and natural history of America and its natural resources, to the
preservation of memorials of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the encour-
agement of the arts and industries of our own people.

It is evident that the National Museum of the United States will of
necessity have features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the
peculiar needs of the people of this continent. It should be remem.
bered that the national collections of every principal HKuropean nation
are divided into several groups, each under separate administration,
though often within the general control of some central authority. In
France, for instance, most of the museums are under the Ministry of
Public Instruction, and in England, to a less extent, under the Depart-
ment of Science and Art.

In the great capitals of Europe the public collections are scattered
through various parts of the same city, in museums with distinctive
names and independent in their organizations. Much of the work
which should properly be done by such museums is omitted, because
no one of them has seen fit to undertake it; while, on the other hand,
much labor is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate—col-
lections of similar scope and purpose being maintained in different
parts of the same city. One of the chief objections to such division
of effort is that much of the value of large collections in any depart-
ment is lost by failure to concentrate them where they may be studied
and compared side by side. In Washington, the national collections
are all, without exception, concentrated in one group of buildings.
The Army Medical Museum now occupies a building side by side with
those under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this prox-
imity, in connection with the long-established policy of cooperation
between the two organizations, renders them, for all practical purposes,
united in interest.

Although the appropriations from the public treasury for the main-
tenance of the National Museum are small, compared with those in
several European countries, the value of objects given by private indi-
viduals is proportionately large. The actual value of such contribu-
tions for ten years past has not, it is estimated, fallen short of $20,000
a year, and in some years it has been greater.
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Among important gifts may be mentioned the George Catlin Indian
gallery, of inestimable value to the American historian and ethnologist;
the collection of North American insects, given by Prof. C. V. Riley;
the collection bequeathed in 1887 by the late Dr. Isaac Lea, of Phila-
delphia, containing, besides minerals and other objects, about 20,000
conchological specimens, and appraised by the State at $10,000; the
collections of mollusks, gems, and precious stones presented by the Rey.
L. T. Chamberlain and Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain; the large and
valuable collections of African mammals, birds, etc., made and presented
by Dr. W. L. Abbott and Mr. William Astor Chanler; the Bendire and
Ralph collections of American birds’ eggs, given to the Smithsonian
Institution; the Lacoe collection of fossil plants, and the collection of
the American Institute of Mining Engineers, for the transfer of which
from Philadelphia to Washington a special appropriation was made by
Congress.

Some exceedingly valuable collections in this country and in Europe
have been bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution, which have not
yet come into its possession. It is estimated that within the past fifteen
years individuals to the number of more than 2,000 have made gifts to
the Museum to the value of $100 each or more.

The National Museum now contains nearly three and a half millions
of objects.

The intrinsic value of such collections as these can not well be ex-
pressed in figures. There are single specimens worth hundreds, others
worth thousands of dollars, and still others which are unique and price-
less. Many series of specimens, which owe their value to their com-
pleteness and to the labor which has been expended on them, can not
be replaced at any price. The collections at a forced sale would realize
more than has been expended on them, and a fair appraisal of their
value would amount to several millions of dollars.

One of the most striking features in the affairs of the Museum is the
manner in which its collections are increasing. In 1895 the number of
specimens is almost eighteen times as great as in 1882.

In the direct purchase of specimens but little money has been spent,
less perhaps in fifty years than either France, England, Germany, or
Austria expends in a single year on similar objects. The entire
Museum is. the outgrowth of Government expeditions and expositions,
and of the gifts prompted by the generosity of the American people.

As night be supposed, a considerable proportion of the objects given
are duplicates of material already on hand, and although these contri-
butions can, with the utmost advantage, be used for distribution to
museums and schools, they do not materially increase the value of the
collections for study by specialists and for general educational pur-
poses.

The need of a larger fund for the purchase of Specimens is yearly be-
coming more manifest. Exceedingly important material is constantly
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. ial

offered at prices very much below what it would cost to obtain it by
collecting, and in many instances, when refused, it is eagerly taken
by the museums and institutions of Europe.

The Museum in its present condition may be compared to a book
from which pages here and there have been omitted, so that the narra-
tive is disjointed and incomplete.

The museums of England are rich with the accumulations of centu-
ries. The National Museum of the United States is young, and has
enormous deficiencies in every department. In needs, more than any
museum in Kurope, the opportunity to increase its resources through
purchase. The total amount expended for the purchase of specimens
for the National Museum since 1889 has averaged less than $6,000 a
year.

For the purchase of specimens for the South Kensington Museum,
from 1853 to 1887, $1,586,634 was expended, or a yearly average of
nearly $47,000.

Toward her other museums England is equally liberal. Exact sta-
tistics are not at hand, but it is quite within bounds to assert that her
average expenditures for the purchase of new objects for museums in
London is not less than $500,000 a year.

Our museum is the result of the activities of an enlightened Govern-
ment. Jhrough a thousand channels materials for the formation of a
museum come into the possession of the Government, and out of such
materials our museum has been built. A museum formed in this man-
ner, however, suffers sooner or later from immense accumulations of
objects of certain kinds and from the absence of others. This is true
of the National Museum. At the outset no additions were unwelcome,
and the expectation that all important deficiencies would be supplied,
might properly be indulged in. As the years have passed, however, it
has become more and more apparent that many of these deficiencies
can be supplied only by purchase.

More striking present results might certainly have been attained by
limiting the developments of the Museum to special fields. We have,
however, had in view the future as well as the present, and no object
has been refused a place in the Museum which is likely to be needed,
even in the remote future, in the development of whatever grand
museum plans the nation may ultimately be willing to promote.

B.—ORGANIZATION AND SCOPE OF THE MUSEUM.

The National Museum is under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and its operations are supervised by the Board of Regents of
the Institution.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is by law the ‘keeper
of the Smithsonian Museum,” and the Assistant Secretary, by the usage
of nearly fifty years, its executive head.
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In the act of Congress passed in 1846, to establish the Smithsonian
Institution, are contained the following provisions concerning the scope
of the museum to be placed under its charge:

1. The act above referred to provides that ‘‘all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or
hereafter to belong, to the United States, which may be in the city
of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and together with new specimens obtained by
exchange, donation, or otherwise, shall be so arranged and classi-
fied as best to facilitate examination and study.

2. It provides that, in proportion as suitable arrangements can
be made for their reception, these objects shall be delivered to such
persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive
them.

3. It provides that they shall be arranged in such order and so
classified as best to facilitate their examination and study.

4. It provides that they shall thus be arranged in the building to
be inclosed for the Institution.

5. It authorizes the Regents to obtain new specimens, by exchange
of duplicate specimens and by gift, and directs also that they shall
be appropriately classified and arranged.

The National Museum thus became the authorized place of deposit
for all objects of art, archeology, ethnology, natural history, miner-
alogy, geology, ete., belonging to the United States or collected by any
agency whatsoever for the Government of the United States, when no
longer needed for investigations in progress.

The collections in the Museum are intended to exhibit the natural
and industrial resources, primarily of the United States and secondarily
of other parts of the world, for purposes of comparison.

The activities of the Museum are exerted especially in three directions:

1. The permanent preservation of the collections already in its posses-
sion, which depends chiefly upon the vigilance of the curators and the
skill of the preparators.

2. The increase of the collections, which are acquired—

(1) From the various Government surveys and expeditions, in
accordance with law;

(2) By gift from individuals, from other institutions, and from
foreign Governments;

(3) By exchange for its duplicate specimens or for publications;
_ (4) By the efforts of officers of the Museum, who make collections
in connection with their regular duties, or are detailed for special
Service of this nature;

(5) By purchase, when appropriations are made by Congress for
that purpose.

3. The utilization of the collections, which is effected by exhibiting
them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on the part of
the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and facilitating
the publication of the results; also by the distribution to other museums
and educational institutions of duplicate specimens, which have formed
the basis of scientific investigation, these being identified and labeled
by the best authorities.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. td

The collections of the National Museum are made up to a very large
extent of the following materials:

1. The natural history and anthropological collections accumu-
lated since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution.

2, Collections which have resulted from explorations carried on
more or less directly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, or resulting from explorations carried on by the Smithsonian
Institution in connection with educational institutions or commercial
establishments.

3. Collections which have been obtained through the courtesy of
the Department of State and the cooperation of United States
ministers and consuls.

4, The collection of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

5. Collections made by the scientific officers of Government sur-
veys, such as the Pacific Railroad Survey, the Mexican Bound-
ary Survey, and the surveys carried on by the Engineer Corps of
the United States Army and by officers of the Signal Corps of the
United States Army stationed in remote regions.

6. Collections obtained by the United States Geological Survey,
the United States Fish Commission, and those resulting from the
activities of the United States Department of Agriculture and
other departments of the Government.

7. The remnant of the collections of the old ‘ National Institute.”

8. The collections made by the United States to illustrate the
animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of
the native races of the country on the occasion of the Centennial
Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876; the fishery collections displayed
by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition at
Berlin in 1880 and at London in 1883, and the collections obtained
from various local expositions, as, for instance, the New Orleans
Cotton Centennial Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati
Exposition in 1887, and the World’s Columbian Exposition in
1893.

9, The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876.

10. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing
and commercial houses of Europe and America at the time of the
Philadelphia Exhibition and subsequently.

11. The materials received from museums in Europe and America
in exchange for duplicate specimens.

12. Collections received as gifts, deposits, or in exchange from
individuals, numbering usually from 1,000 to 1,500 each year.

The publications of the Museum consist of—

1. The Annual Report.

2. The Proceedings of the National Museum.
3. The Bulletin of the National Museum.

4, The series of circulars.

Papers by members of the Museum staff based upon the collections
have been printed in every scientific periodical in the United States
and in many of those of Europe.
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

RELATIONS OF THE MUSEUM TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Smithsonian Institution, although it bears the name of a for-
eigner, has for half a century been one of the most important agencies
in the intellectual life of our people. It has been a rallying point for
the workers in every department of scientific and educational work,
and the chief agency for the free exchange of books, apparatus of
research, and of scientific intelligence between this and other coun-
tries. Its publications, which include more than two hundred volumes,
are to be found in all the important libraries in the world, and some of
them, it is safe to say, on the work-table of every scientific investigator.
Its great library constitutes an integral and very important part of the
national collection at the Capitol, and its Museum is the richest in
existence in many branches of the natural history and ethnology of
the New World. Many wise and enlightened scholars have given their
best years to its service, and some of the most eminent men of science
to whom our country has given birth, have passed their entire lifetime
in working for its success.

Through these books, through the reputation of the men who have
worked for it and through it, and through the good accomplished by
its system of international exchange, by means of which within the
past forty-three years nearly one and a half million packages of books
and other scientific and literary materials have been distributed to
every region of the earth, it has acquired a reputation at least as far-
reaching as that of any other institution of learning in the world.

It is therefore representative of what is deemed in other lands the
chief glory of this nation, for whatever may be thought in other coun-
tries of American art and literature, or of American institutions
generally, the science of America is everywhere accepted as sound,
vigorous, and progressive.

In the scientific journals of Great Britain and other European coun-
tries the reader finds most appreciative reviews of the scientific publi-
cations of the Smithsonian, the Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the
Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Com-
inission, and they are constantly holding up the Government of the
United States as an example of what governments should do for the
suppert of their scientific institutions.

It is surely a legitimate source of pride to Americans that their work
in science should be so thoroughly appreciated by other nations, and it
is important that the reputation should be maintained. Nothing can
be more in consonance with the spirit of our Government, nor mere in
accord with the injunction of Washington in his Farewell Address,
admiringly quoted by Sir Lyon Playfair in his address as president of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science:

Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions Jor the
general diffusion of knowledge.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. HS

In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public
opinion, it should be enlightened,

No one has yet explained, except by conjecture, why James Smithson
selected the United States as the seat of his foundation. He had no
acquaintances in America, nor does he appear to have had any books
relating to America except two. Rhees quotes from one of these (Trav-
els through North America, by Isaac Weld, secretary of the Royal Soci-
ety) a paragraph concerning Washington, then a small town of 5,000
inhabitants, in which it is predicted that “the Federal city, as soon
as navigation is perfected, will increase most rapidly,” and that, at a
future day, if the affairs of the United States go on as prosperously
as they have done, it will become the grand emporium of the West and
rival in magnitude and splendor the cities of the Old World.

Inspired by a belief in the future greatness of the new nation, realiz-
ing that while the needs of England were well met by existing organi-
zations, such as would not be likely to spring up for many years in a
new, poor, and growing country, he founded in the new England an
institution of learning, the civilizing power of which has been of ineal-
culable value. Who can attempt to say what the condition of the
United States would have been to-day without this bequest?

Well did President John Quincey Adams say:

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses
which ever signalized the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence
of the founder, none can be named more deserving the approbation of
mankind,

The most important service by far which the Smithsonian Institution
has rendered to the nation has been that extended from year to year
since 1846—intangible but none the less appreciable—by its constant
cooperation with the Government, public institutions, and individuals
in every enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed advice,
support, or aid from its manifold resources.

There have been, however, material results of its activities, the
extent of which can not fail to impress anyone who will look at them.
The most important of these are the library and the Museum, which
have grown up under its fostering care.

THE LIBRARY.

The library has been accumulated without aid from the Treasury of
the United States. It has, in fact, been the result of an extensive
system of exchanges, the publications of the Institution having been
used to obtain similar publications from institutions of learning in all
parts of the world.

The value of the books distributed since the Institution was opened
must have been nearly $1,000,000, or nearly twice the original bequest
of Smithson.'! Many of the publications in each of these series are now
out of print.

1This estimate is based upon the prices which are charged for the books by second-
hand dealers, as shown in their sale catalogues.
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In return for these, and by purchase, it has received the great col-
lection of books which forms its library and which is one of the richest
in the world in the publications of learned societies, and therefore of
inestimable value, containing, as it does, the record of actual progress
in all that pertains to the mental and physical development of the
human family, and affording the means of tracing the history of every
branch of positive science since the days of the revival of letters until
the present time. This library was, in 1865, deposited at the Capitol,
as a portion of the Congressional Library.

The Smithsonian Collection, which includes more than three hundred
thousand volumes and parts of volumes, constituting perhaps one-
fourth of the National Library, is to be installed in a special hall of its
own upon the main floor of the new Library Building. The rapidity
with which it is increasing is indicated by the fact that in the last two
years 67,589 titles were added. '

The I Pen racien has probably done more toward building up a great
library in Washington than would have been possible, had all its income
been devoted strictly to lhbrary work, as was at one time seriously
proposed.

The books are still deposited chiefly in the Capitol, but though their
number has been so largely increased, year by year, now forming one
of the most valuable collections of the kind in existence, they not only
remain unbound, but in a far more crowded and inaccessible condition
than they were before the transfer, a condition of affairs which it is
hoped will soon be remedied.

The purchasing power of the publications of the Institution, when
offered in exchange, is far greater than that of money, and its benefit
is exerted chiefly in behalf of the National Library, and also to a con-
siderable extent in behalf of the National Museum.

The amount expended during the past forty years from the private
fund of the Institution in the publication of books for gratuitous dis-
tribution has been fully half as much as the original Smithson bequest.

These publications have had their influence for good in many ways;
but, in addition to this, a library much more than equal in value to the
outlay has, through their buying power, come into the possession of
the nation.

In addition to all this, a large amount of material has been acquired
for the Museum by direct expenditure from the private fund of the
Smithsonian histitution. The value of the collections thus acquired is
estimated to be more than equal to the whole amount of the Smithson
bequest.

The early history of the Museum was much like that of the library.
It was not until 1858 that it became the authorized depository of the

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

scientific collections of the Government, and it was not until after 1876
that it was officially reorganized as the National Museum of the United
States.

But for the provident forethought of the Smithsonian Institution,
the United States would probably still be without a reputable nucleus
for a national museum.

The relations of the Museum to the system of popular lectures, for
many years established in Washington, which replaces the old Smith-
sonian courses, once so influential, and the assistance which it affords
each year to students of science, are referred to elsewhere in this
report.

The Institution publishes many circulars giving information on scien-
tific subjects, which are distributed gratuitously to those who write to
make inquiries, and this system is being continually extended. Inaddi-
tion to this, a large correspondence is carried on with people in search of
information on scientific topics. Probably not less than 7,500 letters a
year go out to people who write seeking to know the name of some object
or other scientific fact. Inquiries of this kind are always answered
promptly and fully; and frequently, to intelligent inquirers, books are
sent which will enable them to find out such names for themselves in
future. This work has not only an educational value, but often a great
economic importance as well, as, for instance, when some common min-
eral has been mistaken for one of value, some useless plant has been
wrongly identified and supposed to be of service in medicine, or some
harmless animal feared as noxious.

The publications of the Institution and its dependencies reach every
State and almost every county in the United States. A careful study
of the subject, recently made by the president of one of the scientific
societies in Washington, seems to indicate that there are several States
which are reached by no scientific publications whatever except those
distributed gratuitously by the Government.

Speaking of the Smithsonian Institution proper, and not of the
Museum or any other trust which it administers, it may be positively
stated that in the execution of the trust of Smithson more has been
given to the Government than has been received. The maciinery of the
Institution’s action has been such that it has incidentally, in connec-
tion with its legitimate work for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge, paid over to the Government the equivalent of much more than
the whole original fund.

The present Secretary has pointed out that ‘‘although by the judi-
cious administration of the Smithson fund nearly $1,500,000, the fruits
of its investment, have been applied during the past forty years to the
advancement of science and education in America (in addition to the
principal, $911,000, larger now than ever before), it should be remem-
bered that the unrestricted income of the Institution is less than

NAT MUS 95 2

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

$60,000 a year, a sum much smaller in its power to effect results than
ever in previous years.”

Can the United States fail to recognize its obligation to supplement
liberally this private contribution for public good, especially if it be
borne in mind that, as Secretary Langley has shown, the Institution
has left in perpetual charge of the nation, in the Museum alone, prop-
erty acquired out of its private fund which is now more than equal in
value to the whole amount of the Smithsonian bequest?

Every museum has its special characteristics growing out of its form
of organization, its location, scope, and financial and other resources.
The character of the National Museum is fundamentally affected by its
connection with the Smithsonian Institution, its dependence upon Con-
gress for appropriations annually, and the necessity, under existing
laws, of its caring for all collections belonging to the Government.

Of the connection of the Museum with the Smithsonian Institution,
it should be said that it is in the ghest degree advantageous. It
should be borne in mind that it is essentially a Smithsonian museum,
since, especially in its earlier history, the Institution expended large
sums of money in aiding explorations, with the distinct purpose of
increasing the collections in certain directions, while of late years
it has deposited all the valuable gifts and bequests of specimens it
has received. It has had in addition, for nearly half a century, the
use of the larger portion of the Smithsonian building, and, what is of
paramount importance, the guidance and influence of the officers
of the Institution, and the very valuable assistance of its numerous
correspondents.

C.—THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

The work of the Museum, if it only performed the functions of an
institution for scientific investigation, would be of sufficient value to
justify its maintenance and extension. The Museum, however, not
only performs these functions, but also does a very great deal to render
the resources of science available to the public at large.

The National Museum isa treasure-house filled with materials for the
use of investigators, and it is also an agency for the instruction of the
people of the whole country.

In a recent address before the American Historical Association, I
attempted to explain the idea of our work as follows:

(1) That public institutions of learning are not intended for the few,
but for the enlightenment and education of the masses.

(2) That the public has a right to full participation in the results of
the work of the scientific establishments which they are helping to
maintain.

(3) That one of the chief duties of the officers of these institutions
is to provide means by which such results may be presented in an
attractive as well as an intelligible form.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

No scientific institution is more thoroughly committed to the work of
the diffusion of knowledge than is the Smithsonian Institution. and no
department of its activity has greater possibilities in this respect than
the National Museum.

The benefits of the Museum are extended not only to the specialists
in its laboratories and to the hundreds of thousands of visitors from all
parts of the United States who pass its doors each year, but to local
institutions and their visitors throughout the country, through the dis
tribution of the duplicate specimens in the Museum, which are made
up into sets, accurately named, and distributed to schools and museums.

In the next annual report it will be shown how many hundred thou-
sands of objects have been thus distributed during the past twenty
years. Every museum in the United States has profited in this way,
and by its system of exchange the Museum has, while enriching itself,
contributed largely to the stores of every important scientific museum
in the world.

Not only are specimens thus sent out, but aid is rendered in other
ways. Within the last year many local museums in the United States
were supplied with working plans of cases in use in the Museum, and
sunilar sets of plans have been supplied within the past few years to
national museums in other countries.

Not only do the people of the country at large profit by the work of
the Smithsonian, as made available to local institutions, but also to a
very considerable extent, directly and personally.

The curator of each department in the Museum is expected to be an
authority in his own line of work, and the knowledge of the whole staff
of experts is thus placed, without cost, at the service of every citizen.

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public to
the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. Such men would find
no welcome among us.

The experience of Europe, with its magnificent public museums and
the history of the several expositions in the United States, should be
quite sufficient to satisfy anyone who has studied the matter, that the
museum is an educational power even more influential than the public
library.

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, the late Sir
Philip Cunliffe Owen, speaking from an experience of thirty-five years,
not only in his own establishment, but in the work of building up the
score of affiliated museums in the various provincial towns of Great
Britain, remarked to the writer:

We educate our working people in the public schools, give them a love for refined

and beautiful objects, and stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave
school, go into the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

eratification of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire, It is as much
the duty of the Government to provide them with museums and libraries for their
higher education as it is to establish schools for their primary instruction.

In the same conversation Sir Philip insisted very strongly that a
museum not actually engaged in educational work of some kind could
not long survive, pointing to the great system of lectures and exam-
inations connected with the Science and Art Department of the Council
of Edueation, of which the South Kensington Museum was one of the
chief agencies.
II—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.

The changes already made in the form of the Annual Report, begin-
ning with the volume for 1893, have been continued in this volume. It
is believed that they have proved advantageous in many ways.

The most important innovation in Part 1 of this Report is the
Appendix which relates to the statement concerning the Library of the
National Museum. This consists of a complete list of all accessions
to the library during the year 1894-95, but does not include books
belonging to the Smithsonian library which have been withdrawn for the
purposes of the National Museum.

The headings which follow indicate the topics which are thought to
be of special importance in connection with both the scientific and
administrative operations of the Museum during the year.

THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The number of organized departments and sections in the Museum
is now 28. There are 7 administrative divisions.

Hon. Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological
Survey, has been appointed honorary curator of all the paleontological
collections, which are now embraced in the department of paleontology.
The names of those in charge of the various sections of this department
are mentioned in Appendix I.

Mr. J. E. Watkins was appointed curator of the technological
collections in February, 1895.

In May Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S. N., was detailed by the Secretary of
the Navy to serve again as honorary curator of the section of materia
medica in the National Museum, fhus relieving Medical Inspector
Daniel MeMurtrie, U.S. N.

Mr. F. W. True and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger were detailed in the
spring of 1895 to report to the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries
for the purpose of accompanying an expedition to Alaska and the
adjacent islands, with a view to studying the seal rookeries. They were
temporarily transferred to the roll of the Fish Commission for this
work.

On July 1, 1894, Mr. R. E. Earll was appointed editor of the Pro-
ceedings and Bulletins of the Museum. Later in the year he was
appointed special agent on behalf of the Museum for the Cotton States

and International Exposition to be held at Atlanta.
21
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. Theodore Gill and Dr. R. EK. C. Stearns are now recognized as
Associates in zoology, Dr. C. A. White, in paleontology, and Dr. R. W.
Shufeldt, in comparative anatomy.

In January Dr. G. P. Merrill was detailed for special duty in the
office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury.

Mr. F. H. Knowlton resigned on July 5, 1894, although he is still
connected with the Museum in an honorary capacity as custodian of
mesozoie plants.

During the year Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agriculture,
was appointed honorary assistant curator of the department of botany
in the Museum, and Mr. R. S. Matthews was appointed an aid in the
department of mammals.

On October 1, 1894, Dr. Walter Hough was appointed assistant
curator of the department of ethnology; Mr. Charles W. Richmond was
appointed an assistant in the department of birds on July 1 of the same
year, and on November 1 Miss M. J. Rathbun, connected with the
department of marine invertebrates, was made an assistant curator.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson was designated assistant in charge of the
department of mollusks on May 17, during the absence in Alaska of
Dr. Dall, honorary curator.

ACCESSIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The accession entries relating to material received during the year
have occupied Nos. 28312 to 29534, inelusive, giving a total of 1,223
separate lots. This is an increase of 62 over the preceding year, and
any increase is the more remarkable from the fact that with very few
exceptions no effort whatever has been made to induce persons to
deposit their collections in the National Museum. This undesirable
policy has been made necessary by the entire lack of additional exhibi-
tion space. ‘The material received during the year has for the most part
been placed in storage, It amounts to 127,524 specimens of all kinds.
The three departments receiving the largest increases were prehistoric
anthropology, mollusks, and insects. An effort has been made to
obtain from the curators figures representing the number of specimens
received during the year, as well as the total number of specimens in
their departments on June 30, 1895. The appended tables, A and B,
Show the results. It is shown that there are now 3,406,855 specimens
of all kinds in the custody of the Museum.

The table indicating in parallel columns the totals in the different
departments at the end of each year since 1882 has been withdrawn, as it
was found that without numerous footnotes it was impossible to account
for the discrepancies which appeared to exist from a comparison of the
totals of one year with another in the light of the table giving the num-
ber of specimens received in each department during the year. This
last number added to the total for the previous year seldom gave the
actual total for the year following, on account of specimens withdrawn
for distribution and otherwise disposed of, On the other hand, as in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 20

the department of geology, the total for a given year was liable to
exceed the total for the previous year by more than the number repre-
senting the specimens obtained during the year. This might be readily
accounted for by the fact that one large specimen upon its arrival
would not unfrequently be broken into a large number of smaller ones.
Hence the necessity for numerous explanatory notes arose, and for this
reason the arrangement of these tables, as here given, will be adopted
in future reports of the Museum.

TRANSFER OF THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM.

In 1869 the National Herbarium was transferred from the Smithsonian
Institution to the Department of Agriculture. The reasons for this
transfer are given under the head of ‘“‘ Review of work in the scientific
departments.” Within the last year, however, a formal communication
was received from the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture proposing
that the Herbarium be again housed by the Smithsonian Institution.
The reasons for the desired change are given in the letter of the Assist-
ant Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 24, 1894, which is reprinted
in the chapter referred to above. The proposition was agreed to by the
Smithsonian Institution, and the actual transfer of the Herbarium took
place in September of the same year.

EXCHANGES OF SPECIMENS WITH INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS
ABROAD,

The Museum has for many years maintained exchanges of specimens
not only with domestic institutions but also, and chiefly, with foreign
museums. This practice has enabled the Museum to dispose profita-
bly of its duplicates, and at the same time to furnish museums and
colleges in other countries with valuable American material for display
or study. The-Museum has exchange relations with almost every
museum of importance in the world. Exchanges of specimens not infre-
quently lead to exchanges of publications also, and by this means the
Museum library has received numerous accessions. Especially has this
been the case since 1894, when a special effort was made to obtain from
foreign museums publications which at that time were wanting on our
shelves.

The exchanges of specimens with institutions at home are so indicated
in the Accession List, which is printed as Appendix 11. The exchanges
with foreign museums and other institutions and individuals abroad
are here briefly referred to.

FOREIGN EXCHANGES IN 1894-95.

Birds.—Birds’ skins have been sent to Mr. A. Boucard, Oak Hill,
Spring Vale, Isle of Wight, England, in continuation of exchanges.

From the La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina (Dr. Francisco P.
Moreno, director), have been received birds’ skins. Similar material
has been transmitted in exchange.

Birds’ skins have been forwarded to Mr. Victor Ritter von Tschusi
zu Schmidhoffen, Hallein, Salzburg, Austria, in exchange for material
already received.

Nineteen birds’ skins have been sent to Rey. H. B. Tristram, The
College, Durham, England, in continuation of exchanges.

Reptiles and batrachians.—Two specimens of Menobranchus Latastei
have been received from Dr. John H. Garnier, Lucknow, Ontario,
Canada.

From the Museum Senckenbergianum, Frankfort-on-the-Main, Ger-
many, have been received, through Dr. O. Boettger, two lizards from
China. <A specimen of Anniella pulchra and two specimens of Ter-
rapene ornata have been forwarded in return.

Fishes.—A east of a fish has been sent to Dr. Ehrenbaum, director,
Biological Station, Heligoland. Marine invertebrates have been asked
for in return.

From the Indian Museum, Caleutta, India (Surg. Capt. A. Alcock,
superintendent), have been received specimens of deep-sea fishes from

the Bay of Bengal. Highty-three species of deep-sea fishes from the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans have been transmitted in exchange.

Forty species of deep-sea fishes have been sent to Dr. L. Lortet,
director of the Museum of Natural History, Lyons, France, for which
material has been promised in return.

Mollusks.—British invertebrates have been received from the Man-
chester Museum, Manchester, England, through Mr. William EK. Hoyle,
in return for material already forwarded.

Dr. H. von Ihering, director, Paulista Museum, San Paulo, Brazil, has
transmitted specimens of Unionide from Central and South America.
Specimens of Unionide from the United States have been sent in
return for material received and for additional specimens promised.

Specimens of Anodonta fragilis have been sent to Mr. J. F. Whiteaves,
of the Geological Survey of Canada.

Insects.—From Mr. Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Waterworks,
South Australia, have been received two specimens of Honey Ant
(Camponotus inflatus) from Alice Springs, MacDonnel Ranges, Central
Australia. Foraminifera have been sent in return.

From Felippo Silvestri, Museo Civico di Storia Naturale, Genoa,
Italy, has been received a collection of European myriapods, repre-
senting twenty-six species. North American myriapods have been sent
in return.

From G. van Roon, Rotterdam, Holland, have been received thirteen
species of Coleoptera from India and fifty-one species of Coleoptera
from Europe. Similar material has been sent in return.

Marine invertebrates—From Kdgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Water-
works, South Australia, have been received Foraminifera from South
Australia. An equivalent in similar material has been sent.

A specimen of Pentacrinus decorus has been transmitted to Dr. L.

COOPERATION OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

The large annual increase in the national collections is due in no
small degree to the aid which the Executive Departments of the Gov-
ernment have extended in various ways. Much valuable assistance
has also been rendered by officials of the Departments who have found
it practicable to perform certain work in the interest of the Museum
without interfering with their official duties.

In the Department of State, Hon. W. W. Rockhill, who has made
very liberal contributions to the collection in past years, is one of the
warmest friends of the Museum. Mr. R. D. L. Mohun, of the Consular
Bureau, has presented a large and valuable collection of ethnological
objects from the Kongo region. Mr. Isaac Townsend Smith has been
instrumental, in his capacity of consul-general of Siam, in forwarding
to the Museum, in behalf of the King of Siam, through his Royal
Highness Prince Devagongse Varaprakar, minister of foreign affairs,
Bangkok, Siam, a Siamese edition of the sacred writing ‘Tripitaka”
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 31

of the southern Buddhists. Mr. R. M. Bartleman, chargé d’affaires of
the United States at Caracas, Venezuela; Hon. C. H. Benedict, United
States consul at Cape Town, Africa; Mr. N. C. Gram, United States
consular agent at Dryefjord, Iceland, have also extended their friendly
offices in increasing the collections.

The Museum is indebted to the Treasury Department for the prompt
manner in which free entry has been granted for material obtained
from many parts of the world. This courtesy has been extended over
a long period of years.

Lieut. J. H. Seott and Mr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Revenue- Marine
Service, have given their personal aid in adding to the collections.

Mr. Isaae Winston, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
has also been a contributor.

In the War Department the same friendly spirit of cooperation has
been manifested. The Quartermaster’s Department has saved the
Museum both time and money in connection with the transportation to
Washington of heavy material from remote localities. Several Army
officers have made contributions of interesting specimens tothe Museum.
Among these are Capt. P. H. Ray, Lieut. W. N. Hughes, Lieut. Wirt
Robinson, Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, and Dr. ©. E,
Woodruff. Inthe same way the Museum is indebted to several officers
of the Navy for addition to the collections—Rear-Admiral R. W. Meade,
Lient. Charles Emmerich, Lieut. C. H. Harlow, and Lieut. Herbert
Winslow. In the latter part of May, 1895, Dr. James M. Flint was
again assigned to duty in the Museum as honorary curator of the sec-
tion of materia medica, and the renewal of his official connection with
the Museum is a source of sincere gratification.

Under the Department of the Interior the principal accessions to
the collections have been received through the Geological Survey.
The material thence derived is alluded to in the List of Accessions
(Appendix 11). The following officers have extended personal assist-
ance to the Museum during the year, either by collecting geological
material or by cooperating with the geological work of the Museum:
Mr. Whitman Cross, Dr. David T. Day, Mr. Frank Burns, Mr. J. 5S.
Diller, Mr. G. H. Eldridge, Mr. S. F. Emmons, Mr. Arnold Hague,
Mr. W. P. Jenney, Mr. F. H. Knowlton, Prof. S. L. Penfield, Mr. W.
Sardeson, Mr. J. E. Spurr, Mr. T. W. Stanton, Mr. W. H. Turner, and
Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan.

The Director of the Survey, Mr. Charles D. Walcott, has assumed
charge of the paleontological department of the Museum, an arrange-
ment which can not fail to redound greatly to the advantage of the
latter. Dr. William H. Dali, Prof. Lester F. Ward, and Prot. I’. W.
Clarke, officers of the Survey, continue to act as honorary curators in
the Museum, and to their active and earnest cooperation is due toa
large extent the progress which has been made in the geological work
of the Museum.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. Z. T. Daniel, of the Indian Office, has made several valuable
gifts of ethnological material to the Museum during the year. Dr.
William J. Elstun, of the Pension Office, has also been a contributor.

Several collections have been transferred to the Museum by the Fish
Commission. From the material received from this source a large
number of specimens have been distributed to educational institutions
throughout the country, over fifty collections having been sent out
during the year.

Prof. B. W. Evermann, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, Mr. Charles H. Townsend,
and Mr. ©. W. Kendall have been personally instrumental in obtaining
interesting material for the collections.

A number of important accessions have been received from the
Department of Agriculture. Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Mr. L. O. Howard,
Dr. A. K. Fisher, Messrs. E. W. Nelson, C, L. Pollard, and Theo. Per-
gande have rendered conspicuous assistance to the Museum. Prof.
C. V. Riley, Mr. F. V. Coville, and Dr. C. W. Stiles have continued to
act in an honorary capacity. Many botanical- collections are received
direct by the Department of Agriculture. These are in due time
incorporated with the National Herbarium according to law. The cir-
cumstances which led to the transfer of the National Herbarium from
the Department of Agriculture to the National Museum building are
referred to at length in another place.

The Bureau of Ethnology, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution,
has transmitted large and valuable collections of ethnological objects
from Indian tribes in different sections of the country.

COLLECTORS’ OUTFITS.

During the year outfits have b2en furnished to collectors as follows:
To Mr. A. W. Ridgway, Point Lookout, Md.; to Capt. James P. Hare,
Avery, La.; to Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, San Diego, Cal.; to Mrs. Con-
stance McElroy, Livingston, Guatemala; to Mr. F. W. True, U. 8.
National Museum, for collecting in Alaska; to Mr. Frank C. Dennis,
Livingston, Guatemala; to Rev. D. W. Snyder, Luebo, Congo Free
State; to Mr. F. W. Urich, honorary secretary of the Trinidad Field
Naturalists’ Club, Port-of-Spain, British West Indies; to Mr. O. Bangs,
Micco, Brevard County, Fla.; to Mr. R. S. Matthews, U.S. National
Museum, for.collecting in West Virginia; to Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Florida
Agricultural College, Lake City, Fla.; to Lieut. Wirt Robinson, steam-
Ship Venezuela, Brooklyn, N. Y., and to Mr. William Palmer, U. S.
National Museum, for use during a collecting trip in Fiorida.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

The changes in the exhibition halls of the Museum have not been
very extensive during the year. Most of the alterations were made
with a view to exhibiting to better advantage the collections previously
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

installed, or for the purpose of making room for small, though in some
cases important, collections or individual objects recently acquired.

The collection illustrating the religions of eastern Asia (Brahmanism,
Buddhism, and Shintoism) was installed and labels prepared for many
of the objects. The collection of Assyrian seals and other small casts
is now installed in four Kensington cases, and a number of objects
relating to the Greco-Roman religion have also been placed upon exhi-
bition. The casts of reliefs from Constantinople have been hung on
the walls of the east hall, next to the rotunda. The collections of
oriental antiquities and religious ceremonials now occupy two alcoves
in the east hall and two in the west hall of the Museum building.

That portion of the historical collection which is on exhibition is in
good condition, but there is still considerable work to be done in the
way of labeling the specimens. Several pieces of apparatus used by
Professor Henry in connection with his researches in electro-magnetism,
which have for many years been in the custody of the Smithsonian
Institution, were placed upon exhibition in the Museum during this
year, together with other pieces of apparatus deposited by Miss Mary
A. Henry. <A special case is devoted to this apparatus. A rearrange.
ment of the specimens in the boat hall is contemplated. On account
of the limited space available for exhibition purposes, the collections
illustrating the various stages in the development of the sewing machine
and the typewriter have been placed in storage.

The exhibition series of the department of paleontology in the south-
east court has been rearranged, and the court again opened to the
public. The former crowded condition of the room has been relieved,
to some extent, by the removal of a portion of the slope-top cases.
Thirty-two of these cases still remain, and in these is installed the col-
lection of invertebrate fossils. The fossil plants and vertebrates are
arranged in the wall cases. A few additional vertebrate fossils have
been placed upon exhibition during the year, and a number of large
casts secured to the walls or placed upon the tops of the wall cases.
The collection of fossil insects occupies one flat-top case, and the large
slabs of tracks have been placed upon screens in the corners of the hall.

The systematic collection of rocks has been entirely rearranged and
the labels of the building-stone collection renewed. Over 200 photo-
graphs were mounted and placed upon exhibition in the department
of geology. Owing to lack of space, the permanent increase in the
exhibition series in this department has been small. Better specimens
are, however, being constantly substituted for less desirable ones.
The mineral collection is being supplied as rapidly as possible with
individual and group labels. The cases have been numbered and an
‘arrangement label” has been prepared and put up, Showing the scheme
of arrangement of the collections. An educational series is in course
of preparation.

The exhibition hall of the department of mammals has been entirely

NAT MUS 95 33

34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

rearranged and rendered more attractive. In carrying out the new
arrangement the position of all of the movable cases was changed.
The appearance of that portion of the collection installed in the wall
cases is seriously diminished by the fact that the mounted specimens
are so close together that the light is obstructed, and in many cases
little more than the heads and shoulders of the specimens can be seen.
The Audubon lithographic pictures of mammals, recently purchased
by the Museum have been hung in the office of the curator, tempo-
rarily. The series of interlocked antlers has been transferred to the
department of comparative anatomy to be incorporated in the osteo-
logical collection. Labels have been made for the porpoises arranged
on top of the wall cases in the south hall. In the department of birds
the exhibition series is in good condition. A limited number of badly
mounted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens not
suitable for exhibition have been replaced by better ones. Several
months were spent in renovating the entire mounted collection, each
specimen being subjected to a process of cleaning, which, it is believed,
will-result in a material improvement in the appearance of the collec-
tion. A few specimens have been added to the exhibition series in the
department of comparative anatomy during the year, and the entire
exhibit is in good condition. The exhibition space in this department
has been increased to a limited extent by placing cases between the
piers above the wall cases. In the department of fishes the condition
of the exhibition series remains the same as last year. In the depart-
ment of marine invertebrates five old-fashioned flat ebony cases have
been replaced by mahogany eases, and the location of some of the
other cases has been changed. The collection of tree snails from the
Philippine Islands has been placed upon exhibition in the department
of mollusks.

The exhibition series in the department of ethnology is embraced in
two groups—the material actually on exhibition and the exhibition
series returned from the World’s Columbian Exposition. Owing to
lack of room, the latter has been temporarily placed in storage. The
work of setting up in the northwest court a special exhibit illustrating
the ethnology of the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona has been
carried on during the year. The change referred to last year in the
arrangement of the exhibition hall of the department of prehistoric
anthropology has been completed. All of the objects, contained in fifty-
two cases, have been rearranged geographically by States and foreign
countries. Twelve cases, containing objects made by or belonging to
prehistoric man, have also been rearranged. In the wall cases on the
north and west sides of the hall the objects from Mexico, the West
Indies, and Central and South America have been installed. The
Pacific Coast objects have been segregated and installed in a case by
themselves, and the mummies are now exhibited in the wall ease on the
south side of the hall. Two additional shelves have been provided in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

each alcove case, and about 900 specimens of mound pottery placed
thereon. Large cases of pottery from Peru, Brazil, and the Arkansas
mounds have been placed in the foyer of the hall. A case containing
a group of Indian figures, and representing a quarry workshop, has
also been installed. A large number of paintings, drawings, litho-
graphs, and photographs of prehistoric objects have been hung on the
walls of the hall; also a map showing the linguistic stocks of North
America, and a chronological map showing the distribution of aborigi-
nal mound districts in the United States. Many additional labels have
been provided for the specimens in the cases,

LABELS.

During the year there were printed 1,870 forms of labels, including
171,544 copies. Of this number 242 forms, representing 82,568 labels,
were printed at the Museum. There were also printed on the Museum
press 57,466 envelopes, copies of blanks, ete., representing 28 forms,
and at the Government Printing Office 558,100 copies, representing 29
forms.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library during the past year have exceeded
those of any previous year since its organization. Dr. Cyrus Adler,
librarian, states that there were received by gift, purchase, and
exchange 1,035 volumes, 2,255 parts of volumes, and 3,311 pamphlets,
making a total of 6,601. This is an increase of more than 2,200 over
the receipts for the year ending June 30, 1894. A complete list of the
accessions by gift and exchange is printed in Appendix tt. There
were retained for the use of the Museum from the accessions to the
library of the Smithsonian Institution 133 books, 619 pamphlets, and
7,451 parts of periodicals. About 1,600 books were bound during the
year, two-thirds of this number belonging to the Museum and the
remainder to the Smithsonian deposit.

The number of books borrowed was 6,110. A large number of books
in the custody of the sectional libraries, which would have been recalled
earlier but for the overcrowded condition of the library, have now been
gathered in. This makes the number of books returned exceed by
about 3,000 the number of books lent during the year.

Extensive additions have been made to the series of publications of
museums, of State agricultural colleges and experiment stations, scien-
tific publications of the United States Government, and publications
relating to early travel in North America. Tor the purpose of accom-
modating these publications, and to relieve to some extent the crowded
condition of the library, a set of bookshelves has been constructed at
the west end of the lecture hall.

The librarian states that the Museum is under obligations to the
Library of Congress for the same hearty cooperation which has been
manifested in the past.
36

The library has been freely consulted by members of the Museum
staff, by officials connected with several of the other scientific bureaus
of the Government, by members of the various scientific societies of
Washington, and by other specialists not connected with the Museum.

A large amount of time has been devoted to a new classification of
the books and pamphlets. This work was nearly completed at the
close of the fiscal year, notwithstanding the large increase of work in
matters of routine. The transfer of the catalogue to cards of the
standard library form was commenced in the early part of the year.
Up to the present time about 4,500 cards belonging to this catalogue
have been filled out.

There are now 21 sectional libraries.

PUBLICATIONS.

The bill relating to the printing, binding, and distribution of public
documents approved January 12, 1895, authorizes the printing of
10,000 copies of the Smithsonian Report (of which Part I is the vol-
ume devoted to the operations of the National Museum), 1,000 of
which shall be for the use of the Senate, 2,000 for the House of Repre-
sentatives, 5,000 for distribution by the Smithsonian Institution, and
2,000 for the National Museum. The quota allotted to the Museum is
quite insufficient to supply even the large public and scientific libraries
throughout the world, not to mention the various departmental and
bureau libraries of the Government, consular officers, collaborators,
and contributors to the collections in the Museum, and the numerous
applications from individuals and institutions not on the mailing lists.
The Smithsonian Institution has, however, kindly placed at the dis-
posal of the Museum a portion of its allotment, thus making possible a
more satisfactory distribution than could otherwise have been eftected.

Requisitions for printing Volume xvit of Proceedings and Bulletin
48 have been sent to the Printing Office.

The Museum Report for 1892, constituting Part 11 of the Report of
the Smithsonian Institution, was published during the year. The sepa-
rate papers in the appendix to the Report were issued in pamphlet form
before the close of the last year. The volume for 1893 is now going
through the press, and its receipt from the printer at an early date is
expected. The separate papers (Nos. 976-1032) in Volume Xvit of
Proceedings have, with one exception, been distributed. The bound
volume will soon be ready for distribution. Advance sheets of a paper
by M. L. Linell, describing a new species of Golden Beetle from Costa
Rica, and a note on two new species of beetles of the Tenebrionid genus
Echocerus, by F. H. Chittenden, were published, in order to secure pri-
ority of descripticn to the authors. The papers will be reprinted as
Nos. 1040 and 1041 in Volume xvitt of the Proceedings. The titles of
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

all papers distributed in separate form during the year will be found in
Appendix vy. Manuscripts of 35 papers to be included in Volume XVIIE
have been forwarded to the Printing Office. These include 14 papers
relating to fishes, 9 relating to birds, 4 relating to mollusks, and 8 papers
on other subjects.

3ulletin No. 48, ‘Contribution toward a Monograph of the Insects
of the Lepidopterous Family Noctuidie of Boreal North America;
A Revision of the Deltoid Moths,” by John B. Smith, has been pub-
lished. The tollowing additional parts of Bulletin No. 39 are now in
the folding room: Part H, “ Directions for collecting minerals,” by Wirt
Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Directions for collecting rocks and for the preparation
of thin sections,” by George P. Merrill; Part J, ‘‘ Directions for col-
lecting specimens and information illustrating the aboriginal uses of
plants,” by Frederick V. Coville; Part K, ‘Directions for collecting
and preparing fossils,” by Charles Schuchert. An extra edition of
Part A, “Directions for collecting birds,” by Robert Ridgway, has
been printed at the expense of the Museum allotment, to supply the
extraordinary demand for this pamphlet. Considerable progress has
been made with Bulletin 47, “The Fishes of North and Middle Amer-
ica,” by David Starr Jordan and Barton W. Evermann, and the volume
will doubtless be ready for distribution during the next fiscal year.
The manuscript for the second volume of the work is now in prepara-
tion. The bulletin will be accompanied by an atlas of plates.

The second of the series of Special Bulletins in quarto form, entitled
“Oceanic Ichthyology,” relating to the deep-sea and pelagic fishes of
the world, by G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, the preparation
of which was noticed in the Report for last year, has been set in type,
and will shortly go to press. The preparation of the third of the series
of Special Bulletins, being the second volume of “ Life Histories of
North American Birds,” by Charles E. Bendire, has rapidly progressed,
and the bulletin is already partially in type. This, as well as the
preceding, will also be published in the Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

Four circulars have been issued by the Museum during the year,
Nos. 43 to 45, requesting the transmission of publications of scientific
bodies and educational establishments to the Museum library and
inviting the contribution of authors’ separates and reprints, and No.
46, soliciting the cooperation of students and collectors in forwarding

4? REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

WORK OF STUDENTS AND INVESTIGATORS AT THE MUSEUM.

A number of persons have availed themselves of the privilege of
examining Museum material in the offices and laboratories of the cura.
tors. These include students, specialists from various parts of the
country who had come to Washington for the purpose of consulting the
collections, and officers of several of the scientific bureaus of the Gov-
ernment.

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., spent considerable time in the depart-
ment of mammals studying the large collection from the Mexican
boundary which he had been foremost in gathering in connection with
his work on the survey. Many specimens were also sent to him at Fort
Myer, Va., for examination and comparison. He has in view the pub-
lication of an extensive report on the geographical distribution and
relationships of the various forms inhabiting the southern border of
the United States. The officers of the Division of Ornithology and
Mammalogy of the Department of Agriculture have had free access to
the mammal collections.

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Leland Stanford Junior University, visited
the Museum during the summer of 1894, for the purpose of studying
the methods of taxidermy employed here.

The committee on classification and nomenclature of the American
Ornithologists’ Union held its sessions in the office of the curator of the
department of birds, and made daily use of the study series, thereby
deciding numerous questions of importance in connection with the
Union’s “Check List of North American Birds.” Mr. Charles B. Cory, of
Boston, Mass., consulted the collections in connection with the identifi-
cation of species of Hlainea from San Domingo. Mr. William Brewster
brought to the Museum a number of specimens of North American and
Mexican birds, whose correct determination necessitated a comparison
with types and other specimens in the Museum. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of
the Department of Agriculture, examined specimens on various ocea-
sions, mainly in connection with his work at the Department. Maj.
Charles E. Bendire, honorary curator of the department of oology in
the Museum, frequently consulted the collections of birds in connection
with the identification of specimens, and also to aid him in fixng the
geographical range of species included in the second volume of his *‘ Life
Histories of North American Birds.” Mr. Henry ©. Oberholser, of the
Department of Agriculture, has almost daily consulted the study series
in connection with special investigations which he is conducting, and
also with a view to obtaining a more detailed knowledge of the North
Americal species and subspecies of birds. Mr. R. P. Currie has made
similar use of the collections. Mr. E. E. Armstrong did considerable
volunteer work in the department of birds, at the same time improving
the opportunity to study the collections.

Dr. G, Baur, of the University of Chicago, who was engaged for a time
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. a

in the study of the Testudinata, and Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia,
were given facilities for study in the laboratory of the department of
reptiles, in connection with the preparation of his forthcoming work on
“The Snakes and Lizards of North America,” which will be published
as a bulletin of the Museum.

Prof. C. W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Phila-

delphia, visited the Museum several times to consult the collection of
Stratyomyide, and Prof. Lawrence Bruner, of Lincoln, Nebr., con-
sulted the collections of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera for the pur-
pose of identifying western species. Mr. Ellison A. Smith, professor
of biology at the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Blacks-
burg, Va., consulted the collection in connection with the identification
of exotic butterflies, and Prof. J. B. Smith, of New Brunswick, N. J.,
visited the Museum for the purpose of examining material in connec-
tion with his monographic work on the Noctuids. Mr. C. H. Roberts
and Mr. Aug. Merkel, of New York City, and Capt. Henry John Elwes,
president of the Entomological Society of London, also consulted the
collections in the department of insects.
. During the present year, as heretofore, Dr. Theodore Gill made use
of the collections of fishes in connection with his studies of families
and genera. Mr. Barton W. Evermann compared specimens in the
collection with material obtained by field parties of the U.S. Fish Com-
mission. -

During the summer of 1894, Prof. C. C. Nutting, of the State Uni-
versity of Lowa, spent several weeks in the laboratory of the department
of marine invertebrates studying the large collection of Hydroids, espe-
cially the West Indian forms. Dr. R. P. Bigelow spent a few days at
the Museum in revising his report on the Stomatopoda. Prof. A. E.
Verrill has continued his studies at New Haven of the Fish Commission
material from the Atlantic coast north of Cape Hatteras, and especially
of the echinoderms.

Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department
of Agriculture, has made use of the Museum collections in connection
with his studies of scientific and economic helminthology.

In the department of mollusks, Prof. William B. Clark, of Johns Hop-
kins University, studied the Tertiary fauna of Maryland; Mr. Charles
W. Johnson, of the Wagner Free Institute of Science, Philadelphia,
studied the Tertiary fauna of North Carolina, and Mr. T. Wayland
Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey, spent some time in the study
and examination of the Eocene corals.

During the year Mr. J. D. McGuire, of Ellicott City, Md., continued
his studies of the art of stone working. Mr. Stewart Culin, of the
University of Pennsylvania, spent considerable time in the department
of ethnology in the study of games and gambling devices, with a view
to comparing them with the series in the Museum of Archeology and
Paleontology at the university. Dr. Franz Boas prosecuted an extended
44 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

study of the ethnology of the Indians of the Northwest Coast, spend-
ing a great deal of time in arranging and labeling specimens. The
results of this study and of his visit to the Northwest Coast in 1895 are
embodied in a paper on the ‘Social Organization and the Secret Societies
of the Kwakiutl Indians,” published in this volume. Dr. W.J. Hoffman,
of the Bureau of Ethnology, was also engaged for a considerable time
in the prosecution of investigations in the department of ethnology. A
paper by him on “The Graphic Arts of the Eskimo” appears in Part II
of this volume.

Prof. J. M. Coulter, of Lake Forest University, spent about ten days
in the herbarium during February and March in the study of Mexican
Umbellifere. Dr. B. L. Robinson was occupied about a week in the
study of the Ranunculacez and neighboring families. Prof. Edward
L. Greene, of Berkeley, Cal., spent several days in making critical
observations of Western species. Dr. Marcus E. Jones, of Salt Lake
City, determined a large collection of plants, giving about four or five
months to the work. Mr. John B. Leiberg, of Hope, Idaho, was in
Washington for several weeks studying the plants of eastern Oregon;
and Mr. P. A. Rydberg, of Lincoln, Nebr., spent two months in the
completion of a report on a collection of plants which he obtained in
the Black Hills in 1892.

MATERIAL RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION AND REPORT.

It has always been the policy of the Museum to examine, free of
charge, specimens transmitted to the Museum for determination, no
matter by whom or from what locality. This privilege has been
appreciated, as is shown by the large number of packages arriving daily
with requests for identification. In this way the special knowledge of
the curators is freely placed at the disposal of anyone who chooses
to seek it. Since the Museum building was opened in i881, not less
than 6,000 persons have taken advantage of this privilege, and nota
day passes without receiving similar requests. In the case of geolog-
ical material, qualitative determinations only can be made, as the
Museum has not facilities for making extended chemical analyses for
the public. Its small and insufficiently equipped laboratory is barely
sufficient for the analytical work which is absolutely necessary in con-
nection with the current operations of the geological departments.

In addition to requests under this head, numerous requests for tech-
nical information, unaccompanied by specimens for determination, are
constantly received, and these two classes of requests alone necessitate
a large amount of correspondence.

During the year material from all parts of the United States, as well
as from British America, West Indies, Mexico, Central America, South
America, several countries in Europe, and from Asia and Oceanica,
was transmitted to the Museum for examination and report. It is very
seldom that any of this material is desired for the collections, and expe-
rience has proved that material of a character likely to be wanted, is
usually transmitted with a request for its return. When any of these
AG REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

sendings are retained, their addition to the permanent collections is
recorded by means of a double number, as may be seen in Appendix
vi. The first number is that which is given to the material on the
“examination and report” record; the latter, the number on the per-
manent accession record. During the year 467 lots (Nos. 2769-3235,
inclusive) have been received. Reports prepared by the curators or
their assistants have been forwarded to the senders.

A detailed list, arranged alphabetically by names, is given in Ap-
pendix VI.

MEETINGS OF ASSOCIATIONS IN WASHINGTON DURING THE YEAR.

The American Historical Association held its tenth annual meeting in
Washington on December 26-28, 1894. The lecture hall of the Museum
was used for the morning sessions. !

On January 3, 1895, the National Science Club held a meeting in the
lecture hall.!

The regular April meeting of the National Academy of Sciences
was, as usual, held in the Museum building. The lecture hall was
used for the public meetings and one of the offices for the business
meetings. The titles of the papers entered to be read at this meeting
are given in Appendix VI.

On February 25, 18838, a joint commission of the Anthropological,
Biological, Chemical, Geographic, and Philosophical societies was
formed, the Entomological and Geological societies being admitted a
short time afterwards. The necessity for more complete cooperation
among these societies had been manifest for some time, and many
of the prominent members used their influence to bring about such
a result. It was felt that one feature of the work, especially, could
be carried on to greater advantage—that of providing for suitable
courses of popular lectures. Accordingly, on January 25, 1895, the
following constitution was drafted, and afterwards adopted by the sev-
eral societies:

I. The joint commission shall be composed of the officers and administrative
boards of the several component societies.

II. The commission shall have power (a) to provide for meetings of the societies ;
(b) to conduct courses of popular lectures; (c) to prepare a joint directory of the
members of the societies; (d) to distribute to all members of the societies periodic
advance notices of the meetings of the several societies; (e) to act in the interest of
the component societies at the instance of any of them.

III. The expense thus incurred shall be borne by the several societies in the ratio
of their membership.

The joint commission was organized on February 20 with Mr.
Gardiner G. Hubbard as president and Dr. G. Brown Goode as vice-
president.

Although the Saturday lectures at the Museum for the season of

‘A list of the papers submitted is printed in Appendix vu.

Geological societies, fnture courses will doubtless embrace the work of
other sections as well. The subjects of the lectures for this year will
be found in Appendix VII.

COTTON STATES AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION AT ATLANTA, GA.

By the act of Congress, approved August 8, 1894, provision was made
for a Government exhibit at the Cotton States and International Expo-
sition to be held at Atlanta from September 18 to December 31, 1895.
The sum of $150,000 was appropriated, with the addition of $50,000 for
the erection of a building, Dr.Charles W. Dabney, jr., was made chair-
man of the Government board of management. The sum of 822,000
was allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum,
of which $16,500 is available for the preparation of exhibits. At the
close of the fiscal year this work was well under way, exhibits being
in course of preparation in the following departments: Mammals, birds,
marine invertebrates, comparative anatomy, reptiles, fishes, mollusks,
insects, paleontology, minerals, geology, botany, ethnology, and pre-
historic anthropology. The technological collections were also repre-
sented, as well as the sections of materia medica, oriental antiquities
and religious ceremonials.

An extended account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in this Exposition, including a description of the exhibits to be pre-
pared by the National Museum, will be published in the Report of the
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896. Not only the
Museum, but all the other dependencies of the Institution, will prepare
exhibits, viz, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-

physical Observatory. The exhibit being prepared by the Bureau of
Ethnology will include a number of life-size models of Papago and
Seri Indians, together with a series of weapons, household utensils,
and articles of personal adornment used by these tribes. A collection
of similar articles used by the Cherokees will also be shown. The
Bureau of International Exchanges will send one of the fifty sets of
Government documents which are annually transmitted by the Bureau
to institutions abroad, and will exhibit a map showing the geograph-
ical distribution of the correspondents of the Institution. The Zoolog-
ical Park will be represented by a series of views of various objects of
interest within its borders, and the Astrophysical Observatory will
send a number of photographs of the special apparatus employed in
connection with the investigations which are being conducted in that
establishment. The Institution proper will exhibit, among other things,
a complete set of its publications, comprising about two hundred
volumes.
III.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC
DEPARTMENTS.

The statements which appear under this heading are for the most
part gathered from the annual reports of the curators. Commencing
with the year 1893, these have been submitted in the form of answers to
a series of questions. This form of report has, after much considera-
tion, been adopted, for the present at any rate, as preferable to the
former plan, the chief objection to which was that the information sup-
plied in the reports did not always present a complete and homoge-
neous statement of the werk accomplished. This made it difficult to
comprehend at a glance how much work had been accomplished in any
special direction, and often resulted in the introduction of a large
amount of material into the volume which did not have a direct bear-
ing on the work of the curator as custodian of a collection, and, there-
fore, although perfectly admissible in an extended essay, with the
work of the department as its basis, was not, at times, altogether
within the scope of an administrative document.

In reviewing the work of the scientific departments in the Museum
during the year which ended on June 30, 1895, the fact must be remem-
bered that considerable time and labor have been necessarily expended
in the preparation of exhibits for the Atlanta Exposition, which opens
on September 18. Exhibits for this occasion are being prepared by
every department in the Museum, and a statement of what has been
done in this direction by each department will be presented in the
report for 1896, that being the fiscal year in which the Exposition is to
be held. An account of these exhibits, it may be added, is now being
prepared in the form of a pamphlet, to be distributed at Atlanta during
the continuance of the Exposition.

Experience has proved that the regular work of the Museum always
suffers to a very considerable extent during the years when expositions
in which the Museum is directed to participate, are held. Nor ean it
be otherwise, since the features which it is especially desirable to
emphasize in special exhibits of this kind are not, as a rule, such as
would ordinarily be made conspicuous in the natural development of
the Museum exhibition series. Again, it is noticeable that in exposi-
tion years the number of papers published by the curators, as the result
of their studies of the enllections under their care, is much smaller

than in other years. This is readily accounted for by the fact that the

lime which would otherwise be given to study is consumed in the spe-
cial work of the exposition, and unfortunately the outcome of this work
does not as a rule redound to the full benefit of the Museum after the
exposition is over. This subject has been already dwelt upon in previous:
reports, and while the Museum is always ready to make every effort
to provide a creditable display at expositions, it can not be said that,
taking everything into consideration, the Museum is much the gainer,
It is true that special appropriations are generally made to enable the
Museum to participate, but these are so inadequate that not only is the
result usually unsatisfactory to the Museum authorities, but also the
Specimens purchased are not always such as can be assimilated with
the permanent Museum exhibits after their return to Washington.

Notwithstanding these obstacles, very excellent headway has been
made in strictly Museum work in many of the departments, as will be
seen in the following account of what has been accomplished.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS,

By far the most important collection received during the year was
that sent in by Dr. W. L. Abbott, who has collected during the year in
Eastern Turkestan, on the border of the Pamir, and in Kashmir. He
presented a collection of 107 specimens, including several fine speci-
mens of Himalayan ibex, Polo’s sheep, Asiatic gazelle, stag, etc.,
together with good series of marmots, pikas, mice, and other small
forms. Mr. William Astor Chanler presented the type of Chanler’s
Reed Buck (Cervicapra Chanleri). From Mr. H.C. Moore were received
40 mammals from South Africa, including several antelopes. This eol-
lection will serve an excellent purpose in filling existing vacancies in the
exhibition series. A collection of West African species, though mostly
in the form of pelts, was received from Mr. J. H. Camp. It included
two specimens of the very rare Golden Mole (Chrysochloris leucorhina).

The collection has received numerous additions from the National
Zoological Park, in accordance with the general understanding that
animals dying in confinement shall be turned over to the National
Museum, the skins and skulls coming to this department and the
skeletons being transferred to the department of comparative anatomy.
Several interesting animals, obtained by the Fish Commission, were
also added to the collection. From the Government exhibits of Costa

tica, Ceylon, Korea, and Johore at the World’s Columbian Exposition,
specimens of mammals were acquired at the close of the Exposition,
although they were not recorded on the catalogue of the department
until during the fiseal year covered by this report. The number of
individuals contributing material to this department during the year
was 56, The collections of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, made during his con-
nection with the Mexican Boundary Commission, included 708 specimens
of mammals. This gift contained material of much scientific value, the
specimens having been prepared and labeled with the greatest care.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 1

as

The fact that his collections represented the results of continuous
exploration along a line of several hundreds of miles, also adds con.
siderably to their value.

The rearrangement of the exhibition series of mammals during the
year occupied the attention of the curator, Mr. F. W. True, for several
weeks. He thus describes the details incident to this work:

In the fall of 1894 a complete rearrangement of the cases in the exhibition hall
waseffected, agreeably with instructions from the Assistant Secretary. The position
of all the movable cases was changed, with the object of making a better balaneed
arrangement and one more attravtive, also to break up the continuous vista pre-
viously maintained in the center of the hall. It was found necessary thereafter to
raise the large cast of a humpback whale, which was done. The series of inter-
locked antlers was transferred to the osteological hall. Several groups for which no
place could be found were packed and stored. Large labels were made for the series
of porpoise casts arranged on top of the wall cases. The Audubon lithographic
pictures of mammals which were purchased and framed by the Museum some time
ago, were hung in the office of the curator until a more suitable place could be found
for them. The cetacean molds were all overhauled and a detailed list made of them
for reference. The taxidermists mounted eight skins, but on account of being called
upon tor other work nothing was completed. A large amount of work was done
upon the alcoholic study series in the way of cataloguing, arranging, rebottling,
etc. The Mearns collection was gone over, a concordance of collector’s and Museum
numbers made, and other necessary work performed. All new accessions were cata-
logued and put in cases. A large number of skins from tho taxidermists’ vats were
labeled and put in their proper places.

The work of the taxidermist is referred to more in detail elsewhere.

The present condition of the collections, so far as the preservation
of the material contained in them is concerned, is better than at any
previous time, as is shown in the following extract from Mr. True’s
report:

The exhibition series is in good condition, but the space and cases in which to
exhibit it are entirely inadequate. This applies especially to the large mammals.
The wall cases are so full that only the heads and necks of the deer, antelope, ete.,
ean be seen. The floor cases are so much crowded that light is obstructed, and the
attractiveness of the collection is much diminished. There are numerous antelopes,
deer, seals, etc., in the taxidermists’ vats, which, when mounted, can be exhibited
only with much difficulty and under unfavorable conditions.

As regards the study series, more storage cases are needed for the large skins.
The alcoholics will need a great deal more labor spent upon them.

As pointed out last year, the large skulls of horned mammals are in need of better
installation. A plan was submitted for that purpose, but was not acted upon. The
great series of small skulls, as stated last year, is in a very unsatisfactory condition
as regards installation. Some 1,500 boxes were purchased for these skulls during the
year, but it was not possible to get the skulls transferred into them.

The card catalogue of skins and alcoholics needs revision. This is an important
matter, but can not be taken up and brought to a finish in the midst of constant
interruption. An incomplete catalogue of this kind is of practically no value.

Besides the necessary administrative work accomplished in connec-
tion with the care of the incoming material and the installation of the
specimens most suitable for exhibition, Mr. True has made special stud-
ies in certain directions. These have resulted in the preparation ot a
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

paper on the occurrence of armadillos of the genus Venurus in Central
America. He has nearly completed a comprehensive paper on the
‘Antlers of the Deer Family.” This will be published as one of the
accompanying papers in the next Report. Work has also been con-
tinued ona monograph of the American moles, in connection with which
the preparation of a series of osteological drawings was found neces-
sary. Mr. True has published four papers during the year—two in
“Science” and two in the “ Proceedings of the National Museum.” The
titles are given in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). A new species was
described in the paper on the “Rodents of the genus Sminthus in
Kashmir,” under the name of Sminthus flavus.

In May, 1895, Mr. True was temporarily attached to the staff of the
U.S. Fish Commission, at the request of the Acting Commissioner, for
the purpose of making a special study of the seal rookeries.

Owing to the limited appropriations made by Congress for the main-
tenance of the Museum, very little can be done in the way of explorations
under the direct auspices of the Museum. Assistance was rendered to
Dr. Mearns in his work connected with the survey of the Mexican
Boundary, by supplying him with collecting material. An expedition
to Lake Okeechobee, Florida, by Mr. Ridgway and Mr. William Palmer,
resulted in obtaining a small number of mammals, chiefly forms not
well represented in the collections. It is most fortunate for the Museum
that the friendly and valuable assistance of Dr. W. L. Abbott, which
has been so often manifested in his generous gifts, has been con-
tinued this year. As already stated, a very important accession has
recently been received from him as the result of his explorations in
Turkestan and Kashmir. The expedition of Mr. William Astor Chanler
and Lieutenant von Hohnel in the Tana River region, Kast Africa, has
yielded an important contribution to the Museum collection of mam-
mals. Reference should also be made to the collections of Mr. J. D.
Figgins in Maryland, and of Mr. J. H. Camp in the Congo region,
West Africa. The thanks of the Museum are further due to Mr.
Charles H. Townsend, naturalist of the Fish Commission, for his zeal
in obtaining specimens for the Museum while engaged in collecting
work under the auspices of the United States Fish Commission.

In accordance with established usage, the Museum has lent its mate-
rial freely to scientific investigators for study. In this connection may
be mentioned several transmissions of specimens from this department
to Dr. J. A. Allen and Mr. F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum
of Natural History, New York; Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia;
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, for use in his studies of the Mexican Boundary
collection; Mr. 8S. N. Rhoads, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Seiences, and Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., of the Department of Agriculture.
Opportunity to study the collection of mammals in the Museum build-
ing has also been extended to Dr. Mearns and to the members of the
staff in the division of economic ornithology and mammalogy in the
Department of Agriculture.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 53

In addition to those already mentioned as having made direct contri-
butions to the collections, the Museum in general, and this department
in particular, has benefited greatly through the friendly cooperation
of Maj. Timothy E. Wilcox, U.S. A., Fort Huachuea, Ariz., who has sent
in many interesting specimens from time to time from the vicinity of
his post; to Dr. Sheldon Jackson, of the Bureau of Education, who
transmitted a skin of Spermophile, and to Prof. I’. A. Ward, Rochester,
N. Y., Prof. William Trelease, of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St.
Louis, and Dr, P. L. Seclater, London, England. The curator states
that many of the officers and employees of the Museum have inter-
ested themselves in obtaining specimens for the collection, no less than
eighteen different persons having rendered such assistance during the
year.

Regarding the plans which the curator has in mind for improving
the collection of mammals, he writes:

What the Museum now needs more than anything else, in my opinion, is a better
representation of exotic mammals. Of about 410 genera usually recognized, we
possess representatives of only 240, leaving 170 genera entirely. unrepresented.
Furthermore, many of the genera now in the collection are represented only by a
single imperfect skin, or a single skeleton. (Of skulls I have taken no notice.) On
very many occasions, in order to become acquainted with the character of a genus
or species, I have been compelled to extract the skull (often imperfect) from the
single specimen in the collection.

The study of mammals has greatly increased of late, and the investigations are
taking a wider range than ever before. In this work the need of specimens of
foreign groups is strongly felt, as if is recognized that work upon American mate-
rial alone is liable to lead to one-sided results. There is no full collection of foreign
mammals in America, and at present our students must limit their researches, or go
abroad to study. In my opinion, the national collection should endeavor to fill this
need.

The number of specimens added to the collection during the year
was 1,484. In the catalogue of skins, skulls, and alcoholics 1,872
entries were made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 60,607,
and in June, 1895, 62,479. Skeietons are considered as anatomical
specimens, and are entered in the catalogue of the department of com-
parative anatomy. In the volume in which are entered the specimens
belonging to the deposit of the Department of Agriculture 6,402 entries
have been made, the last entry in June, 1894, having been 65,818, and
in June, 1895, 72,220.

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS.

The curator, Mr. Robert Ridgway, reports the number of accessions
as somewhat in advance of those received in 1894, while the number
of entries in the catalogue has been more than 1,100 in excess of that
year. The scientific value of the accessions of this year is also reported
as greater than of those received in 1894, The curator mentions the
names of thirty establishments and individuals from whom important
additions to the collections have been received. ‘The list is headed with
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the name of Mr. A. Boueard, Isle of Wight, England, who presented
1,666 specimens. These represent a large number of families. Dr. W.
L. Abbott, whose name occurs in connection with accessions in several
of the departments, contributed 258 specimens from Kashmir, Ladak,
and Turkestan. Six accessions, including species obtained in Arizona,
California, and Lower California, were transmitted by Dr. Edgar A.
Mearns, U. S. A., and Mr. F, X. Holzner, in connection with their
work on the Mexican Boundary Survey. In addition, Dr. Mearns also
contributed 310 specimens, representing 106 species, from Fort Clark
and Fort Hancock, Tex. The curator obtained 152 specimens from
Florida, Maryland, and Illinois, and Mr. R.S. Matthews, of the National
Museum, presented 159 specimens of birds from the United States,
Mexico, and Central America. Mr. Charles W. Richmond, assistant
curator of this department, presented 115 specimens from Virginia,
Mexico, Borneo, and other localities. Mr. William Palmer, chief tax-
idermist of the Museum, presented 8 specimens of Hooded Warbler
from Virginia, and also collected 36 specimens from Florida, In addi.
tion to collections received from individuals, mention should be made
of the contribution of 21 specimens from Alaska by the U.S. Fish
Commission, and of 41 specimens from South America, acquired from
the La Plata Museum, La Plata, Argentina, in exchange.

A series of specimens has been selected with considerable care for a
special exhibit of a popular character. This has been installed on the
first floor of the south tower. In this series it is intended to include
every species likely to be asked for by the casual visitor, or by anyone
making an elementary study of ornithology. It is thought that it will
be of especial interest to the pupils of the public schools. The exhibit
consists of the following series: The more familiar European birds; the
more familiar North American birds; remarkable birds of other parts
of the world; a series illustrating and explaining the confusion of pop-
war names, examples of protective coloring, protective mimicry, ete.,
“Giants and Pygmies,” or the largest and smallest members of certain
groups; a series of eggs, showing a gradual transition in size from the
egg of the extinet -/piornis to that of the smallest humming bird; albi-
nos and other abnormal color varieties and malformations, and a series
of flightless birds, together with those of extraordinary powers of
flight, for comparison. A catalogue will probably be printed, which, by
means of reference numbers and letters, corresponding to the number-
ing on the shelves and cases, will enable the visitor to locate any speci-
men without difficulty. In addition, a label will be provided for each
specimen. it is also proposed to place in the alcove a reading table
and a case containing a few selected works by well-known writers on
ornithology.

Valuable assistance in the preparation of this exhibit has been
received from Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller, of Brooklyn, N. Y.

The following paragraphs from the curator’s report will serve to show
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5D

what progress has been made in caring for the collections, and also the
present condition of the exhibition and study series:

The collections have been thoroughly inspected at proper intervals, and fumi-
gated with bisulphide of carbon to destroy any insects which might be present. No
insects have been found, however, and, except in the exhibition cases, few of which
are sufficiently tight to prevent the ingress of insects or to allow of effective fumi-
gation, and in the old Salvin cases in the west basement, there is little danger to be
apprehended in this direction.

Some changes have been made in the mounted collection, as follows: A limited
number of badly mounted specimens have been remounted, and other specimens too
dilapidated for exhibition have been replaced by better ones. The taxidermist has
been engaged for several months past in renovating the entire mounted collection,
subjecting each specimen to a process of cleaning, which, it is hoped, will result in
a material improvement in this part of the collection.

A volunteer assistant, Mr. KE. E. Armstrong, spent over two months in the depart-
ment of birds, in this time lining with sheet cotton the trays (about 850 in number)
contained in the 54 quarter-unit cases in the bird gallery, resulting in a great
improvement to this part of the study series.

The condition of the exhibition series is very good, and improvements and renova-
tions are being made as time permits. The condition of the study series is excellent,
as far as that portion of the collection accommodated in the bird gallery is con-
cerned. The large birds, stored in the west basement, are in course of rearrange-
ment (and have been for several years), this having been proceeded with until the
cases of the new model provided for the purpose became exhausted. The work has
since been continued on sporadically to accommodate temporarily the increase in the
collections.

The work of Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist, is referred to more in
the chapter relating to the work of the Museum preparators.

The curator has completed an elaborate treatise on the Galapagoan
avifauna, and the paper has been submitted for publication. It consists
of some 650 pages of manuscript, accompanied by outline maps illus-
trating the range of all the species known to inhabit the archipelago,
and two plates of outline figures illustrating generic and specific charac-
ters. The text includes observations on the origin of the Galapagoan
avifauna and other matters. It will doubtless prove to be a work of
great value, and is, in the words of the curator, ‘‘in some respects the
most important work that the author has written.”

The avifauna of the island satellites of Madagascar, from the Comoro
group to the Mascarenes, has been somewhat similarly worked up,
though in less detail. The paper embodying the results of this work
is based primarily on Dr. Abbott’s collections from Aldabra, Assump-
tion, Gloriosa, and the Seychelle Islands, but is not quite finished.
Progress has also been made on a comprehensive treatise on the birds
of North and Middle America. This is a work of great magnitude and
importance, and will constitute a valuable addition to the ornithological
literature of the Museum.

The gallery in the Smithsonian building, used by the department of
birds for office purposes, is in many ways unsuited to work requiring
close application. There being no room in either building available for
the use of the curator, he has found it necessary to do a large part of
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

his literary work at home. In view of the difficulties encountered, he
is entitled to great credit for the work which he has been able to
accomplish in addition to the routine duties of the department.

The explorations of Dr. W. L. Abbott in Kashmir, Ladak, and Turk-
estan, have, as already intimated, redounded in a large degree to the
benefit of this department. The collecting work accomplished by Dr.
Edgar A. Mearns and Mr. F. X. Holzner, of the Mexican Boundary
Survey, by Mr. Ridgway in Maryland and Florida, and by Mr. William
Palmer in Florida, has resulted in the acquisition of many interesting
specimens.

Several ornithologists have used material belonging to the depart-
ment in connection with their special studies. In some instances the
material was transmitted to their homes, while in others it was studied
in the gallery of the department. The curator gives the names of thirty
persons through whose cooperation the collections have been enriched
during the year.

It is gratifying to remark that the material in this department has
served as a basis for 26 papers published during the year by the
curator, Mr. C. W. Richmond, the assistant curator, and several col-
laborators of the Museum. These are all included in the Bibliography
(Appendix IV).

The total number of specimens received during the year was 5,499.

The entries in the catalogue books aggregate 5,499, as follows:

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS’ EGGS.

Maj. Charles Bendire, honorary curator, reports that 2,023 eges and
nests were added to the collection during the year. Their value is pro-
portionately as great as that of the accessions in the previous year,
although far less in number. Several new species and subspecies were
included. Nearly all the accessions to this collection were given to the
Museum, and the records contain the names of 30 donors who have thus
rendered assistance. Only four specimens were acquired by purchase

The most important contributions were made, as in several previous
years, by Dr. William M. Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., whose generosity has
elicited the warmest gratitude of the Museum authorities. His con-
tributions this year consisted of 346 sets, including 1,224 eggs (repre
senting 159 species), and 50 nests. This accession contains many rare
and valuable specimens, besides adding nine species and subspecies to
the collection. Among other contributors of valuable accessions were
Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, Pa., who forwarded 38 specimens,
representing 11 species; and Mr. Chase Littlejohn, Redwood City, Cal.,
who presented 20 specimens, representing three species. Collections
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 57

were also received from the U.S. Fish Commission and the Department
of Agriculture.

This collection, including both the exhibition and study series, is in
excellent condition, every accession being carefully catalogued, labeled,
and disposed of as soon as it is received.

The curator has devoted most of his time, when not engaged in work
on the accessions, to the preparation of the second volume of ‘ Life His-
tories of North American Birds,” which is now in the hands of the
printer.

The last catalogue entry made in June, 1894, was 27088 and in June,
1895, 27655,

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The material added to the collections during recent years has been of
special value from a scientific standpoint, and the past year has been
no exception. The number of specimens received in 1895 shows a slight
increase over the records of previous years, Nearly 1,100 specimens
were added to the collection, the largest number heretofore received in
any one year being 1,055. This was the total for the year ending
June 30, 1892, when the material from the Death Valley Expedition
was received. By far the most important collection was that sent in
by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., of the International Boundary Com-
mission, which was found upon examination to contain a number of
new species. Dr. A. K. Fisher, of the Department of Agriculture, made
collections in the vicinity of the Mexican boundary, and material of
considerable value was received from him during the year. A small
but interesting collection of reptiles from the Jombené Range, East
Africa, was received from Mr. William Astor Chanler. Several val-
uable collections were transmitted by the U. 8. Fish Commission,
including material obtained by Messrs. Evermann and Hirsch from
the Maumee Basin, and by Mr. C. H. Townsend from the Galapagos
Islands. Dr. William L. Abbott presented material from Turkestan,
and Prof. John Macoun, of Ottawa, sent a collection of Garter snakes
from Canada. <A specimen of Amblyostoma annulatum, of which only
one example had previously been taken, was purchased from Messrs.
H. H. and C. S. Brimley, of Raleigh, N.C. A few specimens of rare
New Mexican snakes were also purchased.

In addition to those whose names have already been mentioned,
reference should. be made to the contributions of Prof. T. D, A. Cock-
erell, of Las Cruces, N. Mex., who transmitted a number of specimens
of reptiles; Mr. Hubert Brown, of Tucson, Ariz., who sent in several
specimens of tizards; Mr. Henry G. Hubbard, of Washington, D. C.,
who collected specimens of Rana cwsopus in Florida; Mr, H. Candlin, of
Kerrville, Tex., who sent specimens of snakes from that region, and
Dr. O. Boettger, Frank fort-on-the-Main, Germany, who transmitted in
a8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

exchange two specimens of Chinese lizards, desired for purposes of
comparison.

During the fall of 1894 the curator made a trip to the Bad Lands of
South Dakota, where he obtained a number of interesting specimens,
Mr. William Palmer, of the National Museum, also made collections
during his visit to Florida, in the spring of 1895.

Experiments have been made with formalin as a preservative, with a
view to using it as a substitute for alcohol, but, while it has been found
to possess advantages over the latter for use in the field, it is doubtful
whether it will ever take the place of alcohol in the preservation of
permanent museum collections.

During the year the entire collection was overhauled, and the alcohol
renewed. The exotic species in the study series have been rearranged.
Owing to lack of space, no attempt has been made to increase the
exhibition series.

As mentioned elsewhere in this report, material has been lent to
specialists for study on several occasions during the year, and to Prof.
E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, were given special facilities for study in
the laboratory of the department.

Dr. Stejneger has commenced the preparation of reports upon the
reptiles of the Mexican Boundary, and upon the collections made by
Dr. Fisher in the Huachuca Mountains. He has also continued work on
his proposed manual of Japanese Herpetology. Several papers based
upon Museum material have been published by the curator during the
year, two of them containing descriptions of new species. All of the
papers are referred to in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The last entry in the catalogue for the fiscal year covered by this
report was 22,482, the last entry for the preceding year having been
21,385, a total of 1,094 entries.

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean still remains honorary curator of this depart-
ment, although since his change of residence to New York Mr. Barton
A, Bean, assistant curator, has practically performed the duties of
curator. In his report he states that, although the accessions of the
year were not so numerous or important as in 1894, much valuable
material has been received. The most important accessions were a
collection of fishes made at Mazatlan by Dr. David S. Jordan and
others, and presented by the Leland Stanford Junior University; a
collection of fishes made at the Azores by Prof. William Trelease,
director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis; a series of deep-
water fishes from the Indian Museum, Caleutta, collected by H. M.S.
Investigator in the Bay of Bengal. The U.S. Fish Commission trans- -
ferred to the Museum types of fourteen new species of fishes collected
in Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, lowa, and Lake Ontario; also collections
of fishes from Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and the Columbia River
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

Basin. In ali, upward of 6,000 specimens were added to the collee-
tion during the year.

Old and recent collections of Japanese and Chinese fishes, not in-
stalled with the general collections, as well as collections made by the
Albatross and from other sources, in the West Indies and around the
coasts of Florida, have been given a temporary place in the basement
storage rooms. Duplicates from the deep-sea collections have been
provided with metal tags and numbered, the species being separated
in jars systematically arranged. Several large collections have been
catalogued, including some resulting from the dredgings of the Alba-
tross in the Pacific Ocean, and received during the previous year.
Perhaps the most important work has been the selection and arrange-
ment of the deep-sea material with a view to the preparation of the
duplicates into sets for distribution to educational establishments. By
this process of elimination the study series is now in a much more sat-
isfactory condition. This series has also been improved by the acces-
sion of new and well-preserved material, including a number of types
of new and rare forms.

No special change has been effected in the exhibition series, which
consists of five cases of casts of fishes, exhibited in the west hall of
the Smithsonian building, and a large number of casts placed on the
tops of cases containing corals, besides two cases of alcoholic speci-
mens preserved in rectangular jars.

Mr. Bean has prepared a list of the European fishes in the collec-
tions, and a list of the types of fishes preserved in the collections is
now receiving his attention. Dr. Theodore Gill has examined a num-
ber of European fishes. Work upon the deep-sea fishes has been con-
tinued by the Assistant Secretary and Dr. Bean, in connection with the
preparation of Special Bulletin No. 2, “Oceanic Ichthyology.” The
assistant curator and Mr. B. W. Evermann, of the U.S. Fish Commis-
sion, have in preparation a bibliographical list of the fishes recorded
from the fresh waters of North America north of the United States.

Accessions of fishes resulted from the work of field parties of the
Department of Agriculture in the Death Valley and in Mexico, the
United States and Mexican Boundary Survey in California, and the ex-
plorations of Messrs. Scovell and Woolman in Mexicoin 1891. In addi-
tion, collections were nade in Lake Ontario and the St, Lawrence
River during July and August, 1894; also in Lake Champlain and in
various streams of northeastern New York, by Messrs. Evermaun,
B. A. Bean, and others, under the auspices of the U.S, Fish Commission.
These will be added to the Museum collections after examination.

Material from this department has been lent to several specialists to
aid them in their researches, and four collaborators of the Museum
have studied the collections in the building.

Twelve papers, based wholly or in part on the collections, have been
published during the year. The authors were Dr. G. Brown Goode,
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dr. T. H.Bean, Mr. Barton A. Bean, Mr. Charles H. Beeson, Mr. Carl H.,
Kigenmann, and Dr. Theodore Gill. Two new families, 11 new genera,
and 9 new species were described in these papers.

Upward of 6,000 specimens were received during the year. The last
catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 45451, and in June, 1895, 47504,

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING GCENOZOIC FOSSILS).

The year 1894-95 has undoubtedly been one of the foremost in the
accomplishment of work in this department. During the absence of
the curator, Dr. William H. Dall, in Alaska, Mr. Charles T. Simpson,
assistant, assumed charge of the work. Dr. R. EK. C. Stearns, who has
labored so faithfully for many years in this department, still serves
in an honorary capacity as associate curator, although he has left
Washington to reside in Los Angeles, California.

The number of accessions received during the year was 111, the same
as in 1894. They are, for the most part, smaller in extent, although
some of them are reported by Dr. Dall as being quite valuable. The
most important contributions, as in many previous years, were made
by Rey. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, to whom the warmest thanks of the
Museum are due for so many valuable additions to the collections.
Among his gifts to the Museum this year was a specimen of Pleuro-
tomaria beyrichi, Hilg., from Japan. Series of land, fresh-water, and
marine shells from the Philippine Islands were secured from Hamline
University, through Prof. H. L. Osborn, in return for naming the large
collection belonging to the university. In a similar way series of Ano-
dontas and Unios from Canada and British America were obtained
from the Geological Survey of Canada, through Prof. J. Ff. Whiteaves.
This material is extremely valuable in furnishing evidence of geograph-
ical distribution, on account of the accurate record of the localities from
which it was derived. Dr. H. von Ihering also transmitted Unionide
and other fresh-water shells from Central and South America, in return
for aid in naming his material. Mr. W. W. Herman presented several
species of Japanese marine shells, in return for similar services. Mr.
W.B. K. Johnson contributed land and fresh-water shells from the Isle
of Pines, Cuba. The Young Naturalists’ Society, of Seattle, Wash.,
gave a series of Verebratula transversa and other shells from Puget
Sound. The California Academy of Sciences, through Dr. J.G. Cooper,
gave a collection of Lower Californian land shells, in return for identi-
fications made for the Academy. An extensive lot of land shells and
other material was collected and transmitted by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,
U.S. A., in connection with his work on the Mexican Boundary Survey.
From the Museum of Natural History in Paris, France, has been
received, in exchange, a set of brachiopods obtained by the Travailleur
at great depths in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The numerous accessions
received from Miss Ida M. Shepard and Mr. T. 8. Oldroyd, in connection
with their investigations of the fauna of San Pedro Bay, California, are
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 61

very valuable to the collection. ‘The first installments of the mass of
material which was collected by the U.S. Fish Commission and placed
many years ago in the hands of Prof. A.E. Verrill, of Yale College, for
study and identification, have been received. This fact is recorded
with much pleasure and the acknowledgments of the Museum are due to
Professor Verrill for the long and difficult task which the study of this
material has imposed upon him.

The curator thus reports on the work accomplished during the year
in connection with the preservation and installation of the collections:

During the year ending June 30, 1895, about 14,132 specimens, representing about
3,000 species, have been entered upon our record book for the study collection. Most
of these, together with a large amount previously entered, have been regularly incor-
porated in the study series, the general index has been further added to and corrected,
and lists of the species and genera for ready reference have been written and placed
in each tray of the working collection. The entire general collection of Naiads has
been carefully examined and compared with the Lea collection and literature and
accurately named, They have been arranged ina natural system, in groups. At the
present time Mr. Simpson is making out cards showing their distribution.

A considerable part of the fine general marine collection presented by the Rev. Dr.
L. T. Chamberlain has been administered upon, a part of this being added to the
general collection and the remainder being placed among the duplicates.

An extensive collection of aleoholic and dry material which was collected by the
U. S. Fish Commission off the coast of New England has recently been received
from Prof. A. E. Verrilil, who has held the same for study and naming. The alco-
holies have been carefully examined and the alcohol made of preservative strength.
The dry specimens are now being labeled by Miss Beard preparatory to being incor-
porated in the study and duplicate series. During the year the shells of the family
Mactride have been carefully named and arranged by Dr. Dall in connection with
his study of the group. ‘The tree snails of the Philippine Islands have been brought
together, arranged essentially according to Pilsbry’s ‘‘ Manual of Conchology,” and
placed on exhibition.

The present condition of the exhibition and study series, both of
recent and Tertiary mollusks, is indicated by the curator in the following
words:

The general marine collection occupies the drawers of the cases running along the |
middle of the main hall; the collection from the west coast of North and South
America and the general collection of land and fresh-water shells are in the south-
eastern gallery; the Jeffreys collection and the collections from the West Indies and
east coast of North America are in the curator’s offices in the north tower; the Lea
collection of Naiads is exhibited in the table cases in the eastern half of the main
hall; the tree snails from the Philippine Islands are exhibited in two table cases in
the western half of the main hall; the duplicates are stored in the basement; the
alcoholic collection occupies the basement room, part of the northeastern gallery,
and two rooms in the north tower; the collection of Tertiary fossils is in the north-
eastern gallery.

Dr. Dall has partially completed his studies of the genus Cerion, nam-
ing three new subgenera, founded on internal jamelle, and has finished
his study and arrangement of the family Mactridw, and the classifi-
cation of the Pelecypoda. The results have been published in the
Proceedings of the National Museum and elsewhere. He has also
continued his work on the Floridian Tertiary fauna.
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Mr. Charles T. Simpson has completed his investigations of the land
snailsof the West Indies, and has carried on through the year his studies
of the Naiads of the Lea and general collections, resulting in a paper
soon to appear in the Proceedings of the National Museum on the
classification and geographical distribution of these forms.

The collection has been enriched during the year by the results of the
explorations of Prof, Alexander Agassiz on the yacht Wild Duck, among
the Bahamas. The Museum was presented with a series in return for
the services of Dr. Dall in working up the collections.

Explorations of the mollusk fauna of San Pedro Bay, California, have
been carried on systematically by a group of conchologists, especially
Miss IdaShepard and Mr. 'T. 8. Oldroyd, for some years. The doubtful
forms have been worked out at the Museum, and a series of them,
including many varieties, has been donated by the collectors. Explo-
rations by the California Academy of Sciences in the Lower California
Peninsula have resulted in collecting some fine and rare land shells, of
which a series has been donated to the Museum by the academy.

Assistance has been extended to several conchologists by the loan
of material from the collections for study in connection with special
investigations. To three specialists have been accorded facilities for
studying the collections of this department in the curator’s laboratory.
A list of these transactions will be found in another part of the Report.

The curator has determined a large amount of material, including
1,701 species forwarded for examination and report by seventy students
and institutions. He has also carried on an extensive correspondence
in the way of supplying technical information in reply to special
inquiries from conchological students in all parts of the world.

The curator has published sixteen papers during the year, almost
all of which have a direct bearing on the work of this department.
Dr. R. E. C. Stearns published two papers in the “Nautilus.” Five
papers based on material belonging to the department were published
by Mr. Simpson—four in the “ Nautilus” and one in the Proceedings
‘of the National Museum.

In connection with the entry in the catalogue of material belonging
to this department, several volumes are used for convenience, and the
total number of entries in these books indicates the entire number
made during the year.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 63

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS.

The report of the honorary curator, Prof.C. V. Riley, shows an increase
in the number of accessions, there being 173 in 1895 against 163 in the
preceding year. The most important gifts in 1895 were as follows:
A collection of Odonata from Chinese Turkestan, presented by Dr.
William L. Abbott, whose generosity to the Museum has been so
frequently manifested in his gifts to this and other departments both
in this and in previous years; a collection of Lepidoptera from Guiana,
presented by the British Guiana Commission to the World’s Columbian
Exposition; a large collection of Lepidoptera from Jombené Range,
Kast Africa, presented by Mr. William Astor Chanler and Lieutenant
von Hohnel; a collection of Japanese insects representing 1,500 species
of all orders from the Imperial University, Tokyo, Japan; types of 35
species of Noctuids from Prof. J. B. Smith, New Brunswick, N.J. Other
valuable collections were acquired by exchange.

The biologie material of Coleoptera, including a large collection of
European larvie, obtained in past years by exchange with Schiédte and
Meynert in Copenhagen, as well as by Professor Riley’s own collectings
and breedings, has been arranged in systematic order in two cabinets.
A large part of the year was devoted to the study and proper arrange-
ment of the exotic Coleoptera. This work was undertaken primarily
to facilitate report upon the Japanese collection and the material
obtained in East Africa by Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. William Astor Chan-
ler, and Lieutenant von Hohnel.

The urgent demand for space in other directions rendered it neces-
sary to temporarily withdraw from exhibition the series illustrating
systematic entomology. The study series are reported to be in good
condition. A large amount of material, especially in the orders Hyme-
noptera and Coleoptera, remains unidentified, owing to pressure of work
in other orders.

During the year the curator commenced a comprehensive study of
the Termites of the world. The assistant, Mr. M. L. Linell, began a
study of the Coleopterous fauna of the Galapagos Islands and its rela-
tion to the continent.

In ten instances material from this department was placed in the
hands of specialists for study and identification. Eight entomologists
have taken advantage of facilities offered to study material in the
curator’s offices.

The curator, his collaborators, and other specialists in entomology
have published during the year 51 papers based upon the Museum
collections. These are mentioned by titles under the names of the
authors, in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Twelve new genera and
329 new species are described in these papers. This remarkably large
number was due to the descriptions by Mr. W. H. Ashmead of new
genera and species from St. Vincent, forwarded by the West India
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

committee for identification. Under this arrangement with Mr. Ash-
mead one set of types has been deposited in the U. 8. National
Museum.

The number of specimens received during the year is about 3,000.
This does not include the Japanese collection of about 10,000. speci-
mens, which was received during the previous year, but not taken up
on the accession records until the year 1894-95. The last entry in the
catalogue in June, 1894, was 1423, and in June, 1895, 1584.

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

An important feature of work in this department has been the dis-
tribution of duplicate collections of marine invertebrates. Forty-two
sets have been disposed of in response to applications from educational
establishments. Reference to these and all other distributions made
during the year will be found in Appendix x. In only four of the
other departments of the Museum—minerals, geology, fishes, and pre-
historic anthropology—has any systematic work in separating the
duplicates for this purpose been possible. From this department, in
addition, twenty-one special collections were also sent out for Museum
purposes and for study. The work of preparing these collections has
devolved upon the assistant curators, Mr. James EH, Benedict and Miss
Mary J. Rathbun. The honorary curator, Mr. Richard Rathbun, has
been able to devote only a very limited amount of time to Museum
matters, being almost exclusively engaged in the work of the Fish
Commission, to which he is officially attached.

There was an increase of eleven accessions over the number received
in the preceding year, and the scientific value of the accessions for
this year far exceeded that of those acquired in the preceding year.
The total number of specimens added to the collections in 1895 was
2,378. The United States Fish Commission was the principal con-
tributor, and from it were received four collections, comprising a large
and valuable series of Holothurians and Foraminifera, resulting from
the cruise of the Albatross to the Galapagos Islands in 1891, types of
Calamocrinus diomedee Agassiz, and Brachyura and Anomura from
the North Pacific Ocean, the latter group containing a fine series of
Lithodide. A collection of crustaceans and worms from the Azores
was contributed by Prof. William Trelease, director of the Missouri
Botanical Garden, St. Louis, as a part of the result of his expedition.
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., transmitted an interesting series of
invertebrates from near San Diego, Cal. This, and numerous other
collections received from Dr. Mearns, was the result of an arrangement
made between the War Department and the Smithsonian Institution
in connection with the work of determining the boundary line between
the United States and Mexico. Mr. Warren W. Herman contributed
erustaceans, echinoderms, and hydractinians from Japan. Mr, Harlan
I. Smith, of Saginaw, Mich., sent crayfishes, sponges, and bryozoans
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 65
from riversin Michigan. He also transmitted some Oniscidie. Impor-
tant accessions were secured in exchange from the Indian Museum,
Calcutta; Manchester Museum, Manchester, England; University of
California, Berkeley, Cal.; State University of Iowa; Leland Stanford
Junior University; Glen Island Museum, Glen Island, New York; Can-
terbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand; Museum of Compara-
tive Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., and from several individuals.

The room at the west end of the Smithsonian building, known as the
“Chapel,” is at present used as the exhibition hall for objects belong-
ing to this department. The space being so limited, it is necessary to
use great care in selecting from the mass of material the most suitable
specimens for exhibition. The result is as pleasing as is possible
under the circumstances, and much has been done during the year
to maintain and inerease the interest of visitors. The work accom-
plished in the preservation and installation of the collections, includ-
ing not only the limited number of objects which are on exhibition,
but also the much larger portions of the collections which form the
reserve and study series, will be best understood from the following
paragraphs taken from the annual report submitted by Mr. Benedict:

The exhibition series does not differ essentially from its condition a year ago.
Five old-fashioned flat ebony cases in the west hall have been replaced by mahogany
ones. The systematic series has been removed from the center to the north end of
the hall, and two of the table cases from near the center to the aleove. Labels for
the collection of mounted commercial sponges have been prepared for the printer.

basement room formerly used by the department of reptiles was early in the
‘assigned to this department, and with the aid of the additional storage thus
orded it was proposed to make a more systematic arrangement of the alcoholics
stored in the basement. But later this room was transferred to another department,
and the contents were moved to a small and dark tower room leading from the gal-
jery used as a workroom.

The collection of annelids has been rearranged in a drawer stack in the gallery,
The collections stored in homeopathic vials in the gallery*have been gone over, and
alcohol und new stoppers added where necessary. The large collection of Alaskan
sponges recently returned by Mr. Lambe has been entered in the catalogue and
duplicates selected. In the winter it became necessary to overhaul thirty of the
duplicate sets put up a year before, as many of the tin cases were rusted. These
were renewed or the specimens transferred to jars.

By far the most important work in the way of adding to the study series was the
return of vast collections of material received from the United States Fish Commis-
sion between the years 1871 and 1887, and stored at the Peabody Museum, New
Haven, Conn., in charge of Prof. A. E. Verrill, pending a report upon the same,
In order that the return of the specimens might be facilitated, Mr. Benedict spent
about three months of the past year in New Haven, assisting in sorting and pack-
ing under the direction of Professor Verrill, the first set of duplicates being set
aside for Professor Verrill, and the remaining duplicates and the reserve set being
returned to the National Museum. Much of the unidentified material has been
treated as if named, a division being made and one set returned to the National
Museum. The unnamed sponges were catalogued before their return, and occupy
nearly 100 numbers in the catalogue book. Miss K. J. Bush has been employed
throughout the year in dividing the Mollusca into three sets, the third set being
for Mr. Sanderson I. Smith. After the arrival of the material in Washington, an

invoice is made and the mollusks are turned over to the department of mollusks.
During the year 1894-95, 68 cases of invertebrates have been shipped, containing
about 7,509 lots of specimens. A beginning has been made in card-cataloguing the
specimens received from this source.

In connection with the preparation of an exhibit for the Atlanta
Exposition, it is proposed to make a series of mountings of dried speei-
mens, especially deep-sea corals, echinoderms, ete. These will later
form a part of the permanent exhibit of the department.

Notwithstanding the necessarily great expenditure of time in the
routine work, Mr. Benedict has continued his studies of Anomura,
especially of the large forms of the family Lithodidie, resulting in a
paper, describing many new genera and species, which has recently been
published in the Proceedings of the National Museum. He has also
devoted such time as he could spare to the study of the Paguride.

Miss Rathbun completed her study of the genus Callinectes, and a
report upon the same is now in press, as is also a paper containing
descriptions of new species of fresh-water crabs. Work on the genera!
subject of American brachyurans has been continued. Miss Rath!
spent about two weeks at the Museum of Comparative Zooloe”
making comparisons of specimens, and in examining Prof. A.
Edwards’s types of West Indian crabs.

Besides the large collections obtained from the dredgings 6
U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross off the west e
Mexico, Central and South America, and off the Galapagos
under the charge of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, and from other eX;
tions made by the Albatross, several other explorations in this \
previous years have resulted in the acquisition of valuable materi,
such, for instance, as the deep-sea dredgings in the Indian Ocean }
Her Majesty’s Indian marine survey steamer Jnvestigator, which brought
to the Museum a valuable collection of crustaceans and corals; t
natural history work of the Mexican boundary Commission, througn
the efforts of Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. A., and the dredgings made by
Mr. William E. Hoyle, chieflyin the Firth of Clyde, which were deposited
in the Manchester Museum, whence an interesting collection was trans-
mitted to the National Museum in exchange. The Museum was the
recipient of important collections obtained through explorations under
the auspices of the Leland Stanford Junior University and the Univer-
sity of California, along the coast of California. The collecting expedi-
tion of Mr. L. M. McCormick, curator of the Glen Island Museum, Glen
Island, New York, in the vicinity of Aden, Arabia, also yielded some
very interesting material, a part of which was secured in exchange.

Assistance has been extended to several specialists by the loan of
material belonging to this department. The Museum is under many
obligations to Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, of the Geological Survey
of Canada, for his generous aid in the study and determination of
a large collection of sponges from the North Atlantic Ocean, and of a
smaller collection of mounted Alaskan sponges. Prof. Edward Potts,

Fish
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 67

Philadelphia, Pa.,and Dr. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., have also identified collections, for which
courtesies the Museum extends its most grateful acknowledgments.
The facilities of the laboratory of this department have, as usual, been
placed at the disposal of specialists desiring to avail themselves of the
privilege.

The titles of eleven papers by Mr. Benedict, Miss Rathbun, Dr. Wal-
ter Faxon, Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, and others, based wholly or in
part on Museum material, were published during the year. Five of
these appeared in the Proceedings of the National Museum. They are
all mentioned by title in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv). Thirteen
new genera, 69 new species, and one new subspecies are described in
these papers. Their names will be found in the supplements to the
Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The number of entries made in the catalogues of the department dur-
ing the year was 1,803. These were assigned to the several books, as
follows:

HELMINTHOLOGICAL COLLECTION.

For several years material suitable for such a collection has been
slowly accumulating, but no attempt has been made until recently to
provide for its systematic preservation and classification. In this work
the Museum now enjoys the cooperation of Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the
Bureau of Animal Industry in the Department of Agriculture, who
received a formal appointment on March 17, 1894. It is a source of
much gratification that Dr. Stiles has found it possible to assume the
duties of custodian of this collection, and the Museum recognizes with
pleasure the addition of another friendly bond between the scientific
staff of the Department of Agriculture and that of the Museum.

Under date of January 9, 1894, Dr. Stiles wrote as follows regarding
the formation of a section of helminthology:

In order to collect and preserve the types of American species of parasites,
and in order to obtain a collection of the typical specimens of parasites of this
and other countries, I think it would be extremely desirable if the U.S. National
Museum would establish a department of medical zoology or helminthology. As I
know that you would favor such a step, I would respectfully submit the following
proposition, in case the Museum does not see its way clear or does not think it
possible to appoint a full curator to take charge of this subject:

I will tender my services as curator without pay, or as honorary curator of
helmirthology or of medical zoology, and will agree to deposit my private collection
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

in the Museum, under such terms as we shail agree upon, as @ nucleus of the collec
tion, in case you can give me a room in which the specimens may be kept, and the
neressary apparatus (bottles, ete.) to take care of material which may be sent in.

On January 13 I addressed the following reply to Dr. Stiles:

I need not say that I shall be very glad indeed to have you attached to the Museum
staff in an honorary capacity. I do not think we wish to establish a section of
medical zoology, but a section of helminthology, in connection with one of the
zoological curatorships, would be very desirable.

This letter was followed, on March 17, by a formal letter of appoint-
ment from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

By an arrangement already completed, the collection will be enriched
by the transfer of the collections made by the Bureau of Animal Indus-
try and by Dr. Stiles personally. The collections of Dr. Hassall and
Dr. Leidy will also be temporarily turned over to the Museum. By
exchanges with museums in Berlin and Vienna, as well as with various
specialists, much important material will, it 1s expected, be obtained.
An invitation has already been extended to all workers in helminthol-
ogy to deposit types or typical specimens in the Museum. Several
colleges have been supplied with parasitic material for study, from the
reserve series, and it is hoped that by pursuing a generous policy in
this direction the Museum will ultimately be the recipient of much
desirable material.

The greater part of the collection at present consists of material
which has been obtained by Dr. Salmon, chief of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, Department of Agriculture, Dr. Stiles, and Dr. Albert
Hassall, who is also on the official staff of the Bureau. Dr. Salmon
has deposited a number of types of species which have been described
in the publications of that Bureau. Dr. Hassall has presented several
cotypes of species described by Cobbold. Through Dr. Stiles’s oftices
a collection of types of species described by Dr. Leidy and belonging
to the University of Pennsylvania has been secured as a loan. In
addition, Professor Stossich, of Trieste, Austria, has transmitted a
number of parasites, and Dr. A. Looss, of Leipzig, Germany, has for-
warded, in exchange, a collection of parasites from Egypt. Dr. H. B.
Ward, of Lincoln, Nebr., has added a number of cotypes to the collee-
tion, and from Prof. R. Ramsay Wright, Toronto, Canada, and Mr.
Robert Mills, Chuluota, Fla., very acceptable material has been received.
Prof. A. Duges, of Guanajuato, Mexico, transmitted some specimens
for determination,

No attempt has yet been made to form an exhibition series. The
material obtained by Dr. Stiles is retained in the Bureau of Animal
Industry until it has been studied, after which it is formally deposited,
according to law, in the National Museum.

The Bureau of Animal Industry has partly for its object the investi-
gation of diseases of animals. The members of its staff are therefore
constantly placed in a peculiarly favorable position for obtaining
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 69

parasitic material. The Bureau has published a large number of valua-
ble papers based on its investigations, and new studies in scientific
and economic helminthology are being constantly commenced. Thus,
Dr. Stiles, who has just completed his “ Revision of the Adult Leporine
Cestodes,” is now engaged in a study of the cestodes of birds.

The titles of papers published during the year by Dr. Stiles and Dr.
Hassall, based upon material in the collections, are given in the Bibli-
ography (Appendix Iv).

At the end of June, 1895, 106 entries had been made in the catalogue.

DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The curator of this department, Mr. I’. A. Lueas, reports that about
250 specimens have been added to the collection during the year. The
accession of greatest value is the skeleton of the type of Cervicapra
Chanleri. This was collected by Mr. William Astor Chanler in the Tana
River region, Kast Africa, and was presented by him to the National
Museum. Some desirable birds in alcohol have been received from Dr.
Edgar A. Mearns, resulting from his participation in the work of the

Under the direction of Mr. Lucas the work of cleaning skulls of mam-
mals and skeletons and sterna of birds has been continued. During
the year 850 skulls have been thus treated for the department of mam-
mals alone. These are entered in the catalogue of the mammal depart-
ment, and therefore the total number of entries in the catalogue of
this department is correspondingly diminished.

Mr. Lueas has continued his studies on the anatomy of the switts
and the tyrant fly catchers, on the taxonomic values of the tendinal
perforations of the tarsus in birds, and on the modifications and taxo-
nomic value of the tongues of birds. He has also commenced a study
of the osteology of Zeugiodon cetoides and of the cranial characters of
the finches and tanagers.

Specimens of birds in alcohol have been lent to Mr. Hubert Lyman
Clark and to Mr. W. P. Pyeraft in connection with their studies of the
embryology and pterylography of birds, and other material belonging
to the department has been transmitted for investigation and compari-
son to Prof. H. D. Cope, Dr. C. S. Huntington, and Prof. H. I’. Osborn.

Several papers by the author, based on Museum material, have been
published in the Proceedings of the National Museum, the “Ibis,” the
“Auk,” and in “ Natural Science.”

The chief drawback to satisfactory progress in this department, as
in many of the other departments, is lack of space. Mr. Lucas has,
however, several plans for future work laid out, and these are best
given in his own words:

Little can be done for the improvement of the study series, owing to lack of room,
but there are many specimens, especially among the birds. which need to be trans-

ferred to proper boxes and labeled, and this will be done as fast as opportunity
offers, while such specimens as can be cleaned will be added to the study series.
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The collection of fish skeletons is in bad shape ewing to cramped quarters; but
little or nothing can be done with it, although it is hoped that a little room may be
made available by placing material now in the study series on exhibition in the
eases recently placed above the wall case.

Much ean be done to improve the exhibition series by providing more descriptive
labels, and there are some gaps in the series of skeletons, especially among the fishes
and reptiles, that it is hoped may be filled. There are various series of specimens
which may be either introduced or added to, among them that commenced during
the year showing the modifications of the dermis and epidermis. A very important
series which it is hoped may be commenced soon is that showing the morphology of
the bones of the mammalian earand hyoid. Another important piece of work which
has merely been begun is the representation of extinct forms in the series of skele-
tons. Itis desirable that this should be done in order that the relations of existing
animals may be properly understood, and it is proposed to introduce in their proper
places typical fossils or casts of fossils, supplemented by figures of the entire skele-
ton, these to be accompanied by suitable explanatory labels giving the anatomical
characters, affinities, and geological range of the various orders or other groups.
It is also desirable to extend the tooth series, the series of domesticated animals,
and above all the synoptic series of invertebrates.

In this connection the curator would call attention to the fact that the care of the
fossil vertebrates takes much of his time, and that the time of the one preparator
and one skilled laborer allotted to the department of comparative anatomy is very
largely occupied with work for the departments of mammals and paleontology.

are shown in the following table:

DEPARTMENT OF PALEONTOLOGY.

It has for many years been felt desirable to centralize all the paleon-
tological collections under one general administration, but not uitil
the present fiscal year has it been found possible to effect the necessary
arrangements. Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the U. 8. Geological
Survey, has accepted the honorary charge of all the paleontological col-
lections, with Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator. The several
divisions of the department which have heretofore existed still remain,
with one exception, under the charge of the same officers who have
hitherto controlled them. The principal object gained by the changeis
that all paleontological material, as soon as it arrives at the Museum, is
assigned to the main department, thus securing a better system of
record than formerly, and thence it is assigned to the special division or
divisions of the department to which it belongs. It will now also be
possible to bring the work incident to the installation of all the paleon-
tological material under one uniform system, and at the same time to
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. tL

relieve several of the custodians of the necessity of attending to the
details of this work.

The personnel of this department now includes Hon. C. D. Waleott
as honorary curator, with Mr. Charles Schuchert as assistant curator.
The vertebrate fossils are still under the charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh,
although the actual work on these collections has been performed by
Mr. F. A. Lucas. The invertebrate fossils are divided among Mr. Schu-
chert, Mr. T. W. Stanton, and Dr. W. H. Dall, while the fossil plants
remain under the general supervision of Prof. Lester F. Ward, with Mr.
F. H. Knowlton and Mr. David White as custodians of the Mesozoic
and Paleozoic collections, respectively.

Dr. Charles A. White, who for many years has personally had the
entire charge of the Mesozoic collection of invertebrate fossils, is now
largely relieved of this work by Mr. Stanton. Dr. White has been
designated ‘‘Associate in Paleontology.” The Museum owes a large
debt of gratitude to him for his efficient work on the Mesozoic collee-
tion of invertebrate fossils, and it is a source of congratulation that
the advantages of his advice and honorary connection with the Museum
are to be continued.

The increase in and the scientific value of the paleontological collec-
tions received during the year are regarded as very gratifying, espe-
cially in the case of the vertebrate fossils. This collection, under the
curatorship of Prof. O. ©. Marsh, of Yale College, has been increased
by the addition of about 65 specimens. Among the more important of
these is a large collection of bones of Zeuglodon gathered in Missis-
sippi and Alabama by Mr. Charles Schuchert. Thirty vertebrie of
Zeuglodon were also obtained, in exchange, from the Agricultural and
Mechanical College, Agricultural College, Miss. In addition, Mr.
Schuchert collected a large number of specimens of Middle Devonian
corals from Moreland, Ky. <A skull of bison from the Kansas gravels
was presented by Dr. A. G. Chase, and a skull of Portheus molossus by
Mr. KE. E, Howell. Casts of a number of fossils have been obtained by
exchanges with the Museum of Natural History iv Paris, the La Plata
Museum, and with Mr. Henry A. Ward, of Rochester, N.Y. A cast of
a Skeleton of Pelargosaurus typus was acquired by an exchange with
the University of Caen, France, and an excellent specimen of Ichthyo-
saurus from Lyme Regis, England, was received in exchange from the
Wagner Free Institute, Philadelphia, Pa.

A small series of fossils has been placed on exhibition, and a num-
ber of large casts placed on the walls or on the tops of the wall cases.
From the collection of bones of Zeuglodon a restoration, more than 50
feet in length, has been made for exhibition at the Atlanta Exposition.
This will be added to the exhibition series after its return to Washing-
ton. The many casts of vertebrates in foreign museums received
during the year are of great value for comparative and decorative pur-
poses. Although the exhibit of this section of the paleontological
department is but small, it has already attracted much attention, and
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the easts and fossil bones of large vertebrates are a constant source of
wonder and interest to visitors. A loan of the type of Aceratherium
occidentale was made to Prof. H. I°. Osborn for use in his studies of the
extinet species of rhinoceros in North America. A large number of
specimens received previously have been catalogued only during this
year. These, together with the entry of material received in 1894-95,
make a total of 283 entries in the catalogue, the last number taken up
in June, 1894, being 1655, and in June, 1895, 1918.

One of the most important accessions to the department of paleon-
tology, from the standpoint of scientific value, is the collection of Ter-
tiary insects from Colorado and Wyoming, received from the U. 8. Geo-
logical Survey. The greater part of it has already been described
and illustrated by Prof. Samuel H. Scudder in Monograph xxt of the
Survey.

The magnificent collection of fossil plants, including also some fossil
fishes, presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., has been referred
to in previous reports. The removal of the collection to Washington
was placed in the hands of Mr. David White, who has pushed the work
rapidly forward with untiring and intelligent perseverance. The sixth
installment has been received during the year. This consisted of two
boxes of fishes from New Jersey, three boxes of Cretaceous and Tertiary
plants, and 43 boxes of Paleozoic plants.

Itis expected that additional material will be received during the
coming year, and in the Report for 1895-96 a more extended reference
will be made to the character and contents of this exceedingly valuable
collection.

Much has been accomplished toward housing and arranging the mate-
rial. During the year 104 boxes have been unpacked, and with the
specimens received in former years this coilection fills the 600 drawers
purchased for the collection, to which the two south tower rooms are
devoted. The arrangement and installation of the material has been
performed by Mr. David White.

A large collection of Middle Cambrian fossils from British Columbia,
fossil plants from Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and fossil fishes,
plants, and insects from the Triassic in Massachusetts, have been
received from the U. S. Geological Survey. Mr. R. A. Blair, Sedalia,
Mo., has presented 60 specimens of Lower Carboniferous fossils, includ-
ing several specimens of a well-preserved graptolite (Dictyonema).
Their occurrence extends the known range of these coelenterates into
the base of the Lower Carboniferous. This is a matter of considerable
scientific importance, as graptolites had not hitherto been known to
oceur above the Middle Devonian.

The exhibit of the paleontological material is contained, so far as at
present prepared, in the southeast court, which has been again opened
to the public. A new and more appropriate entrance to the court was
cut through the south wall, and the eastern one closed. The former
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 13

crowded condition of the court was relieved by removing the plants
and vertebrates from the slope-top cases to the wall cases, allowing
eight slope-top cases to be discarded. Thirty-two of these cases remain
for the exhibition of invertebrate fossils. The plants and vertebrates
are being arranged in the wall cases, with the four corners of the room
occupied by large slabs of tracks, standing on screens. All the fossil
insects in the department have been assembled and appropriately
mounted with figures on tiles. This collection is now on exhibition in
a flat-top case.

Considerable time has been expended in caring for the paleozoic col-
lections of the Geological Survey, 20 boxes having been unpacked and
the specimens washed and provisionally assorted.

Work on the paleozoic plants will be pushed to completion by Mr.
David White, on his return to Washington. The exhibits of the ineso-
zoic and cenozoic plants are nearing completion, and the manuscript
for the labels is nearly ready for the printer. Three additional cases
are required by Professor Ward, which, with the 7 already assigned,
will permit of 5 being devoted to the Lacoe collection of paleozoic plants
and the other 5 to mesozoic and cenozoic plants. If sufficient cases
can be provided, it will no doubt be possible to install an exhibit of
vertebrate fossils, under the supervision of Mr. Lucas, which will prove
very attractive and instructive.

The invertebrate fossils exhibited and stored in the 32 slope-top cases
will require much labor in connection with the selecting, mounting,
and working up of nearly 400 boxes now in storage. Much of this
material in storage is the property of the Geological Survey, but is all
at the disposal of the Museum as soon as an opportunity occurs to
work it up.

The study series practically remains in the same condition as formerly
This collection also requires much work to remove the duplicate mate-
rial and to clean and enter upon the Museum registers all material
desirable for the permanent collections.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his studies of fossil Brachiopoda, and it
is hoped that a paperresulting from this work, to be entitled “Synopsisof
North and South American Fossil Brachiopoda, including Bibliography
and Synonymy” will soon be ready for publication. The special studies
of Dr. Dall are referred to under the head of the department of mollusks.

Material in the custody of this department has been lent for study to
Prof. John M. Clarke, Albany, N. Y.; to Prof. William B. Clark, Johns
Hopkins University, and to Prof. J. F. Whiteaves, of the Geological
Survey of Canada. Fossils have been sent to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, of New-
port, Ky., and to Prof. John M. Clarke for identification, and the
Museum is under obligations to these gentlemen for their courtesy in
this connection.

Although there is a great quantity of most interesting material for
study and description ov hand in all of the various collections of this
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

department, there has been afforded very little opportunity for the
preparation of papers for publication during the year, on account of the
large amount of preliminary work necessary in the way of arrangement
and classification. Mr. Knowlton has, however, published five papers
relating to paleobotany, and in them one new genus and seven new
species are described.

The number of specimens received during the year, so far as they can
be counted, is upward of 6,642, not including the Lacoe collection of 44
boxes, and the collection of bones of Zeuglodon.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANTS (NATIONAL HERBARIUM).

The most important matter affecting this department was the formal
transfer of the Herbarium from the Department of Agriculture to the
National Museum building. This was the result of correspondence
between the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture and the Acting Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution. Copies of the letters are here
presented. The history of the growth of the Herbarium will interest
many, and a brief statement relative to the same is here given.

At the time when definite lines of policy were adopted in order to
secure the expenditure of the income of the Smithsonian Institution in
such a manner as most effectually to carry out the intention of the
founder in his purpose of promoting the ‘‘increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men,” it was determined to make no appropriation of
the funds to further or support any object which could be equally well
accomplished by some other agency. In pursuance of this policy an
arrangement was effected with the Commissioner of Agriculture to
transfer the National Herbarium of the Institution to the care of the
Department of Agriculture. The Herbarium then contained 15,000 to
20,000 specimens from all parts of the world, properly classified and
labeled. These specimens were the result of various expeditions of the
Government and of special explorations carried on under the auspices
of the Institution. The collection had from the first been under the
eare of Dr. Gray and Dr. Torrey, who served without compensation.
Upon their retirement the desirability of employing a competent bota-
nist became obvious. On account of lack of money, however, it was not
possible to make the position a salaried one, and therefore it became
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 75

necessary to seek some other means of providing for the care of the
collection. The Department of Agriculture was, as already stated,
asked to assume this responsibility. It consented, with the under-
standing that the appointment of the botanist to be placed in charge
should be approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
that the collections should be accessible to the publie for practical or
educational purposes, and also accessible to the Institution for scien-
tific investigation. It was further agreed that full credit be given to
the Institution in the publications of the Department for the deposit of
the original specimens as well as tor such additions as the Institution
might make from time to time.

The tollowing agreement was formally signed by the Commissioner of
Agriculture and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution:

First. All the botanical specimens in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution,
about 20,000, and all that may hereafter be collected by it, shall be transferred to the
Agricultural Department on the following terms:

1. That a competent botanist, approved by the Institution, shall be appointed to
have charge of the collection.

2. That the collection shall, at all times, be accessible to the public for educational
purposes and to the Institution for scientific investigation, or for supplying any
information in regard to plants that correspondents may ask for.

3. That due credit be given to the Institution in the report of the Agricultural
Department for the original deposit and for such additions as may be made to it,
from time to time, by the Institution.

Second. That the Agricultural Department shall transfer to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution any specimens it may now have, or may hereafter obtain, that are not neces-
sary to illustrate agricultural economy, such as those of ethnology and of various
branches of natural history, similar credit to be given in this case as required in
the former.

The transfer was made in 1869, and the conditions were fulfilled. Dr.
Parry was appointed botanist, and at once commenced a systematic
arrangement of the Herbarium. He found the number of species to be
about 15,000, included in 25,000 specimens. The most valuable portions
of the Herbarium thus transmitted by the Smithsonian Institution to
the Department of Agriculture were:

1. The plants collected by the exploring expedition under Admiral
Wilkes (1838-1842). The botanists of this expedition were Mr. William
Rich, Dr. Charles Pickering, and Mr. W. I. D. Brackenridge.

2. The collection of plants made by Mr. Charles Wright during the
North Pacific Exploring Expedition, under Commanders Ringgold and
Rodgers (1853-1856).

3. The plants collected by the naturalists who accompanied several
surveying parties which made explorations for the route of a Pacifie
railroad.

4, Collections made during the survey for the Mexican boundary by
Dr. C. C. Parry, Dr. J. M. Bigelow, Mr. C. Wright, Prof. George Thurber,
and Mr. Arthur Schott.

5. Numerous contributions to the North American portion of the
76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Herbarium, also plants from British America, Japan, Mantehuria, China,
Sandwich Islands, Mexico, Jamaica, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, and Para-
guay; also from Hungary, Illyria, and other parts of Europe. Collee-
tions were also received from the Imperial Academy of Science at St.
Petersburg and from the Imperial Botanic Garden.

During the twenty-six years following the transfer, up to the year
1894, many large and valuable accessions have been added, a large
proportion of which was received by the Department of Agriculture.
The Herbarium now contains not less than 275,000 specimens.

The fact that the Herbarium was not housed in a fireproof building
has been the occasion of criticism, and during the session of the Botan-
ical Congress in Madison, Wis.,' this subject was discussed and the
following resolutions drafted:

Whereas the National Herbarium, with all its wealth of specimens of inestimable
value, is at present deposited in a building which from its construction and use is
peculiarly liable to destruction by fire; and

Whereas such destruction would be an irreparable loss to the science of botany;
therefore, be it

Resolved, Vhat we, the members of the Madison Botanical Congress, hereby appeal
to the Senators and Representatives of the National Congress to make early provision
for a suitable fireproof )uilding for the preservation of this scientilic treasure, and
we would respectfully request the Secretary of Agriculture to urge upon Congress
the desirability of prompt action in this matter.

Actuated, no doubt, in part by the sense of responsibility involved,
the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in a letter, having the approval
of the Secretary of Agriculture, dated July 24, 1894, and addressed to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, after recognizing the
Institution as the lawful custodian of the scientific collections of the
Government, requested the transfer of the Herbarium to the immediate
custody of the Institution. To this the Institution assented, in a letter
dated July 28, 1894, signed by the Acting Secretary. A third letter,
addressed by the Seeretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, dated August 16, 1894, directed the transfer
of the Herbarium. The actual removal of the collection was effected
in September, 1894.

Mr. Frederick V. Coville, botanist of the Department of Agriculture,
has succeeded Dr. George Vasey as honorary curator of the depart-
ment of botany, and in this capacity is in charge ot the National
Herbarium. Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agriculture, has
been appointed assistant curator.

The correspondence above referred to is here presented :

FROM TILL ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.

JULY.24, 1894.
Sir: The Smithsonian Institution, as we understand it, is designated by law the
enstodian of all of the scientilic collections of the Government. This Department
has already transferred many collections, parts of collections, and specimens to the
care of your Institution, and will, it is hoped, continue to do so from time to time.

1 August 23, 1893
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. Cb

The collection of plants known as the National Herbarium has been left in the
immediate charge of this Department, the expense of its care, maintenance, and
extension being annually provided for in our appropriations.

This collection is, we are informed, a very valuable one, especially since it con-
tains a great number of ‘‘type specimens” from the Fremont, Wilkes, and other
expeditions, and deserves to be housed and cared for in the most reliable and efii-
cient manner. It is at present located in the offices of the division of botany in the
main building of the Department of Agriculture. As is well known, this building
is not firepreof, and is considered to be unsafe for other reasons

I write, therefore, with the approval of the Honorable Secretary, to ask the Smith-
sonian Institution to provide a place for this collection. Being desirous of relief
from further responsibility for the safety of this collection, which is connected only
in part with the work under our charge, we feel that we have a right to make this
request of your Institution.

Since the botanist of the Department of Agriculture is also curator of the Her-
barium, and since an assistant curator and several clerks and laborers are provided
to work on it, this Department would expect to continue, through these legaily
appointed officers, to do all necessary work upon the herbarium, and must, for this
purpose, have full access to it.

In addition to the space required for the Herbarium proper, several rooms will be
required for the accommodation of these workers an some storage space for duphi-
cate specimens. The details of these matters will be explained by the botanist.
This Department would expect to have the privilege of removing to its building
from time to time any portion of the Herbarium that may be required for study in
connection with its work. The working collection of fungi in the division of vege-
table pathology and the collections of the division of forestry, having been made
independently of the Herbarium and its appropriations, are not considered a part
of it and are not offered for transfer at this time. The grass collection of the Her-
barium will also be needed at this Department fer the present.

If desired, the cases and like furniture can be transferred with the collection.

Respectfully yours,
Cuas. W. DABNEY, Jr.,
Assisiant Secretary.
The SECRETARY, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D.C.

FROM THE ACTING SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

JULY 28, 1894.

Sir: Iam in receipt of your letter of July 24, asking the Smithsonian Institution
to relieve the Department of Agriculture from the responsibility for the safety of the
collections of plants known as the National Herbarium, by providing a place for it in
a fireproof building.

Iappreciate fully the value of the National Herbarium, and although all the build-
ings under the charge of the Institution are already overcrowded, I find that it is
possible, by still further condensing, to assign to the collections of plants which you
offer to transfer, together with those already here, a space on one of the balconies
in the new Museum building with the adjoining laboratory rooms, which, though
inadequate for its proper reception will, in a certain way, meet the necessities of the
case, and which has at least the recommendation of being free from the danger of fire.

Tf the caces and other furniture referred to in your letter can be transferred to the
Museum, I see no reason why the plants may not be received at any time that may
suit the convenience of the Department.

I understand it to be your purpose that the botanist of the Department of Agri-
culture shall retain the position of honorary curator of the botanical collections in
(i REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the National Museum, which he now holds by courtesy of the Department of Agri-
culture and by comm‘ssion from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. This
is very acceptable, as is also your proposition that certain other employees of the
Department of Agriculture shall continue to work upon the herbarium under his
direction. While the Institution is prepared to provide a safe place for the herbarium
and preserve it from deterioration, it can not at present assume any expense ‘or
maintaining and enlarging it. I speak of this for the purpose of emphasizing the
fact that if the herbarium is to fulfill its function of continued usefulness to the
Department of Agriculture, it will be necessary that the Department shall contribute
to its maintenance as in the past. In order to render this possible, the work-rooms
already referred to will be available to accommodate the persons engaged in this
work under the direction of the botanist.

Every facility will be afforded to the Department for the use not only of the Her-
barium to be transferred, but of all the other botanical material and collections in
the Museum, together with the extensive botanical library belonging to the Institn-
tion. Portions of the collection of plants may be withdrawn for study upon the
request of the botanist of the Department of Agriculture, so far as is consistent with
their safe-keeping and proper use.

Inote what you say in regard to the collections in the divisions of vegetable pathol-
ogy and forestry, and have no comment to offer. The situation is, however, differ-
ent in regard to the grasses, for, since they constitute part of the herbarium proper,
and a considerable portion of them have been deposited with the Department of
Agriculture by the Smithsonian, it seems to me that this fact should he recognized,
and that the custody of the grasses should be transferred to the Institution with the
rest of the herbarium, although, in accordance with the terms of the agreement just
stated, it is proper that as much of this collection should be retained at the Depart-
ment as is needed for the work in progress. I would suggest, however, that a full
series of the grasses be sent to our fireproof building as soon as practicable, so that
in case of fire a portion of this valuable collection may be saved.

If, when you are ready to make the transfer, you will, as you suggest, request
Mr. Coville to confer with me, I will do all in my power to have the new space
arranged so as to provide in the best way for the interests of the work.

Yours very respectfully,
G. BROWN GOODE, Acting Secretary.

Hon. CHARLES W. DABNEY, JYr.,

Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, Washington City.

FROM THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.

AuGUST 16, 1894.
Str: Ihave the honor to inform you that, in compliance with the arrangements
made through correspondence with the Honorable Assistant Secretary of Agricul-
ture, I have this day directed the botanist and curator of this Department to pro-
ceed to remove the National Herbarium, its furniture, and persons engaged in
working thereon, or so much thereof as you may be able to accommodate, to the

space which you have kindly provided for it in the National Museum.
Respectfully yours,
J. STERLING MORYtoN, Secretary.

The SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

In his report for the year ending June 30, 1895, the curator, speak-
ing of the more important accessions of the year, mentions 6 which
were received through the Smithsonian Institution and 45 which came
direct to the Department of Agriculture and are now deposited in the
herbarium. References te these and all other accessions to the Herba-
rium wil] be found in the Accession List (Appendix 11). The total
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 79

number of specimens received and added to the Herbarium during the
year was 16,897. For the last half of the year the curator has included
only those specimens which were actually placed in the collection.
Previously all specimens received had been counted.

The space now occupied by the Herbarium is the east balcony of the
Museum building, with a floor area of 12 by 62 feet, four tower rooms,
each 12 by 10 feet, and two anterooms, each 8 by 10 feet. Mr. Charles
Louis Pollard, of the Department of Agriculture, assists the curator
and assistant curator in the administration of the collection.

A complete revision of the Herbarium has been found necessary
since the transfer to the Museum building was made. New labels have
been added, and the determinations of species have been carefully
examined with a view to the correction of any errors. This revision
has already extended to the Rubiacew, and it is expected that it will be
completed during the coming fiscal year.

The transfer to the main Herbarium of the collection hitherto stored
on the south balcony of the Museum building has also been com-
meneed. The dicotyledonous trees and shrubs, genera represented
in a fossil state, and the plants collected personally by Prof. Lester F.
Ward, who is in charge of the collection of fossil plants, will, however,
be retained for use in the department of paleontology.

A series illustrating the flora of the District of Columbia will be
placed in a separate case, where it will be generally accessible to
students.

Dr. Rose has undertaken the work of selecting and marking all the
type and cotype specimens in the Herbarium. The sheets to which
these specimens are attached are taken out, marked with a red label,
placed in a red folded cover, and then returned to their proper place in
the collection. During the year 46,565 specimens have been mounted.
A large part of this number consisted of specimens received in pre-
vious years, but not before mounted on account of lack of facilities for
the work,

A revision of Prof. Lester F. Ward’s “Guide to the Flora of Wash-
ington and Vicinity” has been commenced by Professor Ward and Mr.
Pollard. Other Washington botanists will assist in special groups.
Monographic work for the “Systematic Botany of North America” has
been commenced by the curator, Dr. Rose, and Mr. Pollard. Dr. Rose
has compieted and published a report on the Mexican collections gath-
ered by Mr. Edward Palmer in 1890 and 1891. He has also continued
the identification of parts of the collections obtained by Mr. C. G.
Pringle and Mr. E. W. Nelson in Mexico. Mr. Coville, in cooperation
with Mr. John B. Leiberg, has identified a large collection of plants
made by the latter in 1894 on the plains of eastern Oregon.

The field agents of the Department of Agriculture have contributed
a large amount of material from Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and
Alaska.
80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Several collections or parts of collections have been sent to special-
ists for study. These are mentioned under the head of ‘ Material lent
for investigation.” The curator names six botanists who have had
access to the herbarium during the year, to aid them in special investi-
gations. He also gives the names of 23 persons who have cooperated
with the department, especially by lending specimens for critical inves-
tigation or by themselves assisting in the identification of species.

In the Bibliography (Appendix Iv) will be found the titles of all
papers published during the year by the curator, the assistant curator,
Mr. Pollard, and two other collaborators, Mr. John M. Coulter and Mr.
L. H. Dewey. Inthe supplements to the Bibliography are included
the names of the new genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies
described in those papers.

Among the propositions which the curator submits in his report for
the better administration of the herbarium, is a plan for affording
increased case room and the transfer of the remainder of the herba-
rium to the Museum building. This is evidently desirable, and every-
thing possible will be done to meet Mr. Coville’s wishes in this respect.
He also recommends the enployment of an assistant in cryptogamic
botany, to properly classify and arrange the Pteridophyta, Bryophyta,
and Thallophyta.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 2761, and in June, 1895,
3431. .

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS.

This department continues under the care of Prof. I’. W. Clarke, chief
chemist of the U. 8S. Geological Survey.

The accessions to the collection of minerals have not been as numer-
ous aS during the previous year. The actual number of specimens
received was 1,055, embracing 140 accession numbers. The most
important of these were contributed by Rey. L. T. Chamberlain and
included, among others, the following specimens: Twenty specimens of
minerals, including garnet, beryl, quartz, agate, thomsonite, ehloras-
trolite, and sodalite from various localities, a carved ornament of quartz
from Japan, 2 specimens of quartz with inclusions from the same
locality, a specimen of turquoise in gangue from New Mexico, a ear-
buncle of garnet, 6 Amazon-stone balls, 5 chrome iron balls, 3 cut and
polished specimens of quartz, an opal from Queretaro, Mexico, a gold
nugget from California, and 2 specimens of tourmaline from Mount
Mica, Paris, Me. These were presented to the Smithsonian Institution
and deposited in the National Museum. There were also received from
Dr. Chamberlain, from the bequest of Mrs. Frances Lea Chamberlain,
12 Tassi paste reproductions of antiques.

From the U.S. Geological Survey have been received 8 accessions
ofmore than usual value. Three important lotsof minerals were acquired
by exchange. The names of all the contributors to the collection are
mentioned in the Accession List.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 81

Considerable progress has been made in supplying the exhibition
series with labels. The cases have been numbered and labels attached.
These indicate the plan of arrangement and the location of the mate-
rial. Experiments have been made with a view to determining the
best method of mounting crystals and preserving specimens which are
liable to decomposition. A special set of specimens, designated the
“educational series,” is being prepared for exhibition. The collections
of gems and meteorites are increasing very satisfactorily. ‘Two collee-
tions of minerals have been made by Mr. Wirt Tassin, assistant cura-
tor, aggregating more than 200 specimens. These have been suitably
distributed among the exhibition and study series. The field parties
of the United States Geological Survey brought in much interesting
material.

Four papers by the curator were published during the year—one as
a bulletin of the Geological Survey, two in the American Journal of
Science, and one in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
These are mentioned in the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

It is the hope of the curator to establish a series of specimens illus-
trating typical famous American localities, and also a series illustrating
the type and original material in the collection, accompanied by refer-
ences to the publications in which the material was described. The
preparation of a guidebook to the collection has been commenced by
Mr. Tassin.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 83320, and in June, 1895,
83615.

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY.

There is pressing need of more exhibition space for the geological
collections, and owing to the crowded condition of the halls very little
can be added to the exhibition series. The present aim of the curator,
Mr. George P. Merrill, is therefore in the direction of eradicating the
poorer specimens and substituting better ones in their places. For
this reason probably not more than 200 specimens have been actually
added to the exhibition series during the year. Mr. Merrill repeats his
recommendation that a balcony be placed around the intericr of the
southwest court, of sufficient capacity to hold some of the lighter and
least bulky of the collections. This would allow room on the floor
for the expansion of the other collections in this departmeit. Unfor-
tunately, Congress has not taken favorable action on the request for
permission to erect galleries, and until this point has been secured,
nothing can be done to relieve the pressure either in this or the many
other departments which are similarly hampered.

The time of the curator and his assistant has been largely occupied
in bettering the condition of the exhibition series, as already intimated,
and in bringing the records of the department down to date. A card
catalogue for the collections is being prepared, and manuscript for

nearly 1,000 new labels has been written. The systematic collection of
rocks has been entirely rearranged, and the labels of the building stone
collection renewed. <A large quantity of duplicate material has been
sorted out to be used in making up the next sets of specimens for dis-
tribution. The curator has, in addition to the large amount of routine
work accomplished, found time to bring to completion his investigation
relating to the mineral nature and cause of fibrous structure of the
various minerals commercially grouped under the name “ Asbestos.”
He is also engaged in a series of investigations relative to the phenom-

=

g
ena attending rock decomposition. A brief paper on this subject, as

illustrated in the region about Washington, has been published during
the year in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. The
title of this and five other papers by the curator, and of one by Mr.
C. Whitman Cross on “The Laccolitic Mountam Groups of Colorado,
Utah and Arizona”, in which are deseribed some rocks in the Museum
collection, will be found m the Bibliography (Appendix Iv).

The accessions of the year numbered 79, and in addition 122 lots of
specimens were received for examination and report. The most impor-
tant of the former are: A systematic series of Stassfurt salts, pre-
sented by the German Kali Works (Nassau street, New York City);
a series of specimens of photographs of borax salts, mines, and
works, presented by the Pacific Borax Company (San Francisco, Cal.) ;
a series of granites, marbles, alabaster, etc., from Egypt, collected for
the Museum by Mr. F. W. Crosby; a large quantity of Uintahite, from
Clear Creek, Utah, received from Mr. B. W. Rice, Tucker, Utah; a
block of meerschaum from Eski Shehr, Asia Minor; a series of soap-
stone, asbestos, apatite, and fresh and decomposed rocks illustrating
weathering, collected by the curator in Nelson and Albemarle counties,
Va.; onyx from Lake Oroomah, Persia, presented by Rev. 8. G. Wil-
son, Tabriz, Persia; a series of remarkable spherulites from the Silver
Cliff region, Coloratlo, presented by Mr. C. Whitman Cross; a series
of silverores from Custer County, Colo., transmitted by the U. 8. Geolog-
ical Survey, and a large nodule of gum copal, weighing 84 pounds,
from the Upper Congo region in Africa, obtained by Mr. J. H. Camp,
Lima, Ohio, who collected for the Museum while engaged as a missionary
in the service of the American Baptist Missionary Union.

The present condition of the collection is indicated by the following

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 62393 and in June, 1895,

catalogue does not by any means necessarily indicate the addition of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 83

only one specimen, since a specimen may be broken up into a hundred
or more pieces, each of which would in a strict count be properly
regarded as a separate specimen.

DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY.

The curator, Prof. Otis T. Mason, reports that the accessions of this
year compare very favorably with those of previous years. Many
additions have resulted from gifts received from foreign exhibitors at the
World’s Columbian Exposition. Among the most important accessious
may be mentioned a rare collection of 662 specimens, illustrating the
divinatory games of vartous peoples, from the University of Pennsyl-
vania; a very valuable series of specimens from eastern Turkestan,
collected and presented by Dr. William L. Abbott, through whose gener-
osity several of the departments in the Museum have been enriched
both in this and in previous years; a large collection from west Africa,
presented by Mr. J. H. Camp and illustrating the arts and industries of
several native tribes; an extremely valuable lot of ethnological objects
from the region of Mount Kilima-Njaro, collected and presented by Mr.
William Astor Chanler; a collection from east Greenland, gathered
by Captain Holm and transmitted in the name of the Museum of Royal
Antiquities in Copenhagen, and a collection of nearly 700 articles
illustrative of the native life and arts of the Congo Free States, secured
by purchase from Mr. Dorsey Mohun. The Bureau of Ethnology has
contributed a most important series of objects collected by Mr. W J
McGee among the Papagos and Seri Indians in southwestern Arizona
and northwestern Mexico.

The already overcrowded condition of the exhibition space assigned
to this department has rendered it necessary to place in storage most
of the recently acquired material, and, to partially accommodate it, the
lower rooms of the west balcony have been provided with shelving.
Here it is proposed to store unit boxes, swinging screens, and mounted
pictures. In the north storage room will be kept the reserve and study
Series illustrating the ethnology of Asiatic and North African tribes.
The third story of the north tower is devoted to Eskimo material. A
card catalogue of the entire exhibit is being prepared.

Regarding the exhibition series, the curator remarks:

The exhibition series in the department of ethnology at the close of the fiscal
year was to be found in two groups—the material actually on exhibition for public
inspection and the exhibition series returned from the Chicago Exposition, which
had been filed away for future use. A great many of these were also designated to
be sent to Atlanta. The series actually displayed is exhibited under two motives—
the first that of technology, the second that of ethnology. Wherever the material
is sufficiently abundant, and from a great number of localities, the whole of man-
kind are considered to be of one species, and all objects belonging to a certain class
are assembled and arranged for the purpose of showing their historical elaboration
and their geographic distribution. This is called the technographic series. How-
ever, where there is a large mass of material of great variety from many peoples and
not exclusively collected from any one, the specimens are displayed at present in
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

ethnographic groups and arranged around the hall. There are sections devoted to
Negroid Africa, Caucasian peoples in Africa and Asia, the peoples of eastern Asia,
including Siam, Burma, Japan, Korea, Thibet, and the Ural-alta group.

This arrangement enables the curator to place before the public, at least in its
proper national and geographic connection, desultory material from ali parts of the
world. As regards the American collection, a great change has been proposed—to
set apart. the northwest range for the continent of America, a special exhibit to be
made of the Pueblo region in the northwest court. This plan has only been partly
carried out.

The curator has made a special study during the year of primitive
methods of travel and transportation, and a paper by him on this sub-
ject is printed in the Report for 1894.

Material in the Museum has been lent for study to Mr. Stewart Culin,
director of the Museum of Archeology and Paleontology, University
of Pennsylvania; to Dr. W. J. Hoffman in connection with his studies
of the pictographie work of the Eskimo, and to Mr. J. D. McGuire in
connection with his investigations of stoneworking among savage
peoples. The use of the drill has been thoroughly studied by Mr.
McGuire, and the results are embodied in a very interesting paper
published in the Report for last year. Dr. Boas has prosecuted an
extended study of the Indians of the Northwest Coast, and a valuable
paper by him upon this subject is included in this volume.

The curator has published sevep papers during the year, including a
study of ‘“* North American Bows, Arrows, and Quivers” (printed in the
Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1893). Mr. Walter Hough,
assistant curator, prepared a catalogue of the ethnologica) exhibit dis-
played by the National Museum at the Columbian Historical Exposition
in Madrid, and also a descriptive report upon the ancient Central and
South American pottery exhibited in Madrid on that occasion.

Alluding to the special plans which he has in view, the curator makes
the following statement:

The curator commenced at the end of the fiscal year to make a classified catalogue
of every ethnological specimen in the collection, with regard to its function, mate-
rial, and its location, for the purpose of indicating geographically the poverty of the
department, especially with reference to American material. Jor instance, all the
stocks of the American race, from Point Barrow to Cape Horn, are arranged alpha-
betically and in the order of their location. It is proposed to have a separate sheet or
column connected with these stocks as they occur, devoted to each of the great
typical industries, activities, or apparatus, and to indicate upon these sheets or in these
columns whether or not each stock has in use this method or apparatus. As soon as
this chart is made out, it can be easily ascertained whether any tribe possesses this
or that art, and if the materials and tools connected with the art are not in the

National Museum, it will indicate an intelligent line aleng which collections ought
to be made.

The curator hopes to devote a great deal of attention to this special research dur-
ing the next year and to utilize the resources of the establishment, with the consent
and assistance of the Director, for the purpose of perfecting the series for America.

There have been 1,270 entries made during the year in volumes 35
and 37 of the catalogue of the department. In volume 35 the entries

run from 165855 to 169330, and in volume 37 from 174426 to 175221.
The number of specimens received was 2,642.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 85

DEPARTMENT OF PREHISTORIC ANTHROPOLOGY.

In his annual report the curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, remarks that
the operations of this year have exceeded those of all previous years
in the number and extent of the accessions as well as in their scientific
value. The most important addition, although not a permanent gift,
was the extensive collection of Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Ga.
It consists of 32,478 specimens from the Etowah mounds and from
Burke and Columbia counties, Ga. The value of this collection consists
chiefly in the opportunity which it affords for a study of the industries
of the aborigines as manifested in their dwellings, burial places, imple-
ments, and utensils. The Nicaraguan Government contributed a valu-
able collection of pottery and stone objects from the exhibit of that
Republic at the Madrid Exposition. Mr. John C. Meyer, of Round Top,
Fayette County, Tex., presented a large series of rude chipped imple-
ments and other objects, including three chipped implements of jasper.
Eleven large pottery vases from Argentina were received from the La
Plata Museum, through the courtesy of Dr. F. P. Moreno. In addi-
tion, the curator makes special mention ot several other accessions, all
of which are included in the Accession List (Appendix II).

Several important changes having become desirable in the arrange-
ment of the entire collection, the curator has devoted himself assiduously
to this work, and the operations incident to the arrangement are
indicated in his own words:

In order to effect this task, it was necessary to rearrange, geographically, all
the objects in 52 cases, according to the various States of the United States and of
foreign countries; also to rearrange the objects made by or belonging to prehistoric
man, contained in12cases. The latter have been arranged in two synoptical series—
chronological and geographical—one representing Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the
other North America. The objects from Mexico, the West Indies, Central America,
and South America were installed in wall cases on the north and west sides of the
hall. All of the Pacific Coast objects were segregated and installed in cases by
themselves, and the mummies were placed in the long wall cases on the south side
of the hall. Two new shelves have been made for each alcove case and 900 specimens
of mound pottery placed thereon. The very large specimens were placed above the
alcove cases, fronting the aisles, thus giving them a decorative, as well as utilitarian,
effect. The prehistoric pottery has been transferred from the Museum building, and
the large glass cases of pottery from Peru, Brazil, and from the Arkansas mounds
have been installed in the foyer of the hall. A large case containing a group of
Indian figures, representing a quarry workshop (?) from Piney Branch, District of
Columbia, has also been setup. A number of paintings, drawings, lithographs, and
photographs of prehistoric objects have been placed on the walls above the cases.
These included a large painting representing the ruins of Spruce Tree House, Mancos
Canyon, Colorado, Major Powell’s map of the linguistic stocks of North America,
and a chronological map adapted to show the distribution of aboriginal mound dis-
tricts in the United States. Two hundred and forty drawers were constructed and
placed in eight sloping-top table cases with frosted glass doors. This work was
completed March 19, and since that time the drawers have been utilized for the
storage of some 3,500 objects belonging to the collection.

The exhibition series is now so installed that every object can be
plainly seen. Labels have been attached to many of the specimens.
86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The curator has commenced a study of prehistoric pipes and smoking
apparatus, and of aboriginal musical instruments. He has also con-
tinued special investigations of paleolithic implements, rude notched
axes, prehistoric copper, jade and cache implements, and prehistoric
Kitrusean objects. A paper by the curator on the history of the sign
of the Swastika has been completed and is printed in the Report for
1894. Various other objects connected with the existence of prehistoric
man in North America have also engaged special attention.

On two occasions specimens from this department were lent for use
in illustrating lectures. The pupils of several schools in the city have
visited the exhibition hall and received instruction from the curator as
to the scope and aims of the exhibit.

Hight papers by the curator, relating chiefly to matters pertaining to
his department, have been published during the year. The following
remarks, bearing upon the special plans which the curator has in view
for the future development of the department, are quoted from his
annual report:

The collections in this department have now increased to 203,520 objects. The
benefit to science of such a collection is by enabling the archeologist and anthro-
pologist to write a history of prehistoric man. In ethnological collections and
objects relating to primitive peoples of modern times, the study of the people’s
habits and customs, and the writing of their history, can be done by the historian
personally visiting the tribes and obtaining his information at first hand. But in
collections relating to prehistoric peoples this can not be done, and we are driven to
a study of the implements, objects, monuments, etc., left by them. The student,
historian, archeologist, and anthropologist compare these objects (1) with each
other, in localities where they have been associated together; (2) with implements
from other localities; (3) he compares one locality with another, and (4) all of them
together with each other—that is, he first establishes, as well as he is able, a unit of
civilization or culture within a given tribe, group, or family; then, by extending his
observations, he establishes other units of culture or civilization in other tribes,
groups, or families, and these units he respectively compares together, first in a
general way, and second, in the details of the implements and objects which go to
make them up.

I propose to make from the specimens in my department such a segregation by
localities; a division, if possible, by time; also an establishment of units of civili-
zation, and thus make the comparison mentioned, or, rather, afford material for stu-
dents either now or hereafter to make this comparison of civilizations. This will
require the services of a draftsman. As no person can by mere words describe the
form of an object, and as the differences of form are, or may be, but slight, and yet
mean much, there is greater necessity for graphic delineation than there would oth-
erwise be. The objects have all been made by hand; there never was any special
pattern for the workman to follow; each man, to a large extent, made every kind of
object, so the differences become more important and the necessity for drawing
greater than it would be under other circumstances. It would not be true to say
there were no type specimens of the objects made by the aboriginal man, because if
he made each one by hazard, as there are a hundred times more implements than
styles, some of them must pattern after the others, and thus some implements have
come to be considered types. But this, I think, is entirely arbitrary, and is the
decision of the modern student rather than the action or intention of the aboriginal
workman. In the endeavor to discover his intention, it is necessary to make draw-

ings enough of the implements to show these types and the differences in their
details.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 87

During the year 660 specimens were distributed, principally in
exchange. Many persons who come into possession of stone imple-
ments and are anxious to learn something of their significance send
them to the Museum for examination. In 1895 there were received for
this purpose 38 lots, aggregating 552 specimens. Reports are invaria-
bly transmitted to the senders as soon as the specimens have been
examined, and in most instances the latter are returned.

The last catalogue entry in June, 1894, was 169540, and in June,
1895, 172315.

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

At the time when the department of ethnology was established in
the National Museum, there were large accumulations of ethnological
objects from various sources which could not be regarded as purely
ethnic material, not being specially connected with or illustrative of
special tribes of men, but which rather formed parts of series of arts
scattered over the entire earth. Such arts might be regarded as folk
inventions and as illustrating a part of the great scheme of human
invention. It was necessary to find a place for these objects, and sev-
eral special groups, among which they might be properly distributed,
were established. These formed what has since been known as the
* Department of Arts and Industries.” Thus the sections of foods, tex-
tiles, fisheries, naval architecture, travel and transportation, the medi-
cines of all peoples, music, and several others, came into existence. In
them the objects are arranged under different classes of types, accord-
ing to their structure, and in each class the objects are further arranged
according to a system of historic development and elaboration. The
Museum records now show that 14 sections have been organized,
although some of these are still without custodians. These are:
(1) Naval architecture; (2) transportation; (3) textiles; (4) foods and
chemicals; (5) fisheries; (6) animal products; (7) graphie arts; (8) histor-
ical collections, coins, and medals; (9) physical apparatus; (10) musical
instruments; (11) porcelains and bronzes; (12) materia medica; (13)
forestry; (14) oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.

Technological collections.—The first four sections in the enumeration
above have been placed in charge of Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins, who, on
February 1, 1895, was designated “‘ Curator of the technological collec-
tions.” To these, other sections will be added as occasion and oppor-
tunity may arise. The development of these collections will be slow,
inasmuch as objects which were used by man in the foundation of many
of the arts are very difficult to obtain. Again, the bulkiness of
many objects which would be most desirable, would render them, even if
obtainable, too cumbersome for installation, nor could space be assigned
for the installation of such relics, owing to the already crowded condi-
tion of the Museum halls. In cases where large objects can be repre-
sented by models, the curator suggests the construction of small models,
varying from one-fifth to one-tenth natural size where it is desired to
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

show the details of machinery, and from one-twentieth to one-fiftieth
where only form and general proportions need to be considered, as in
the case of buildings, ships, ete. Scale drawings, photographs, or
other representations of objects illustrating the earlier steps in the
epoch-making arts, would be desirable. From them small models can
bemade. These, accompanied by labels containing sketches in outline,
explaining graphically such details as are precluded by the limitations
of a small model, may be made the means of illustrating the history of
the beginnings of the more important American industrial arts. Such
a scheme might at first be thought to duplicate to a certain extent the
work of the Patent Office in that direction. It will be remembered,
however, that the records of that office contain only such documents
and models as have been presented for examination and adjudication
by persons mainly interested in drawing up claims. This would not
interfere with a presentation of the most important epoch-making
inventious, such as Henry’s electromagnetic sound telegraph.

The curator will endeavor to extend the series illustrating the begin-
nings of the steamboat. By the addition of a few models to the pres-
ent collection, the Museum would have a very satisfactory exhibit. He
also has in view the preparation of a case containing models illustrat-
ing presses and machinery relating to the early steps in the art of
printing and paper making.

During the present fiscal year few objects of special importance were
received. Among the most interesting were several pieces of appara-
tus used by Prof. Joseph Henry in his investigations of electromagnet-
ism, which led to the invention of the magnetic telegraph. These had
for many years been preserved in the Smithsonian building, but have
now been placed on exhibition with other pieces of apparatus used by
Professor Henry and deposited in the Museum by his daughters. A
special case is devoted to perpetuating the history of the important
discoveries in electricity which he made. A model of his first electro-
magnetic sound telegraph apparatus, made by John Sehultzbach, of
Washington, under Mr. Watkins’s supervision, has been added to the
collection, and other models, prepared for exhibition at the Atlanta
Exposition, will be installed in the Museum at its close. The curator
has not yet had an opportunity to rearrange the collection of models of
vessels. Capt. J. W. Collins, who was formerly in charge of this col-
lection, has, since his resignation, been employed by the Museum to
prepare a full descriptive catalogue which will serve as a history of
naval architecture as illustrated by the models and other objects in the
Museum. This work was commenced on April 1. With a view to
maturing plans for a systematic rearrangement, a model of the exhibi-
tion hall devoted to naval architecture has been made, and also rough
models of all the boats suspended from the roof. The work of rear-
rangement will be advanced as soon as the necessary supports are in
place. Many of the boats were taken down, cleaned, and measured

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 89

preparatory to their being described by Captain Collins in the cata-
logue already alluded to. On account of the limited space available
for purposes of exhibition, the collections showing the various stages
of development in the sewing machine and the typewriting machine,
have been placed in storage.

Mr. Watkins has devoted considerable study to the evolution of the
various methods of transportation, and, referring to this subject in his
annual report, he says:

During such time as was not consumed by other duties during April, May, and
June, 1895, I continued the investigations (which I have been engaged in for several
years) of the circumstances which led to the final improvement in the wheel and
the other mechanical devices which have tendered the attainment of high speeds
possible in the art of transportation on land and water, which have proven such an
important factor in modern civilization. The results of these investigations are
embodied in the models prepared for the Atlanta Exposition, the drawings for which,
together with the superintendence of their construction and the preparation of
labels, have consumed much time. Each of the labels for the models illustrating
land conveyance contains, in addition to a brief printed description, a smali sketch
which gives more information at a glance than could be conveyed to the average
museum visitor by many printed words. Itis my belief that this same idea, extended
and modified by the duplication of these sketches by some photomechanical pro-
cess, may be made extremely useful, not only in connection with museum specimens
on exhibition, but for permanent record in catalogues and elsewhere. A series of
these illustrated labels, properly arranged, can with a few additions be made to
form an illustrated handbook of the collection.

It is proper to make special mention of the assistance rendered by
Dr. Francis B. Stevens, of Hoboken, N. J., whose aid in preparing the
drawings for the machinery of the models illustrating the early history
of the steamboat has been invaluable.

In this connection Mr. Watkins adds:

Dr. Stevens, a distinguished engineer, now in the eighty-third year of his age,
has acquired by observation and practice a fund of information concerning early
mechanical history in America of the greatest importance. To have been able to
act as the medium for preserving this history through the collections in the U.S.
National Museum, I regard as a great privilege.

The help extended by Mr. George C. Maynard in obtaining for the
Museum relics and other objects desirable for the collections is also very
highly appreciated. Mr. Maynard is associated with several societies
which were organized for the purpose of preserving the history of elec-
trical and mechanical inventions in general.

In the general catalogue only six entries have been made during the
year, the last number being 191200. The objects pertaining to naval
architecture are entered in a separate catalogue book, which is now, as
above indicated, being prepared by Captain Collins. Other books are
kept for the entry of accessions to the collections of textiles, foods, and
chemicals.

The graphic arts coilection.—The absence of the curator in Europe
during the last halfof the fiscal year (January to June) has curtailed the
operations of the department, and the following remarks have reference
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

therefore to what was accomplished during the first six months of the
year (July 1 to December 31, 1894).

The principal contributors of specimens were Mr. N. S. Amstutz,
Cleveland, Ohio; Mr. J. M. Falconer, Brooklyn, N. Y.; Mr. J.W. Osborne,
Washington, D. C.; the United States Geological Survey, and Mr. W,
W. Wallingford, Washington, D.C. The entry of the accessions took
up 61 catalogue numbers (5501-5561). The most interesting of these
are 44 specimens illustrating the transmission of photographs by means
of electricity. They were contributed by Mr. N.S. Amstutz, the inventor
of the process. A photomechanical color-print was purchased from the
United States Aluminum Printing Plate Company, New York, and a
book containing chromolithographs was obtained in exchange. The
duplicates, which are not included in the above total, have been sepa-
rated. <A catalogue of the specimens on exhibition has been prepared,
and also a card catalogue of the whole collection. This is arranged by
technical divisions, preliminary to a more systematic arraugement
later on.

Materia medica.—This collection is again under the charge of Dr.
James M. Flint, U.S. N., who resumed his connection with the Museum
May 24,1895. For several years the collection has been practically
camplete, and little remains to be done except to replace specimens
from time to time with fresh material and to substitute new labels for
old. Only five specimens were received during the year. These were
recorded under catalogue numbers 142309 to 142513, which is the last
entry of the year.

The historical collections.—There is a continually increasing interest
shown in objects relating to the history of the United States during the
colonial and Revolutionary periods. If sufficient exhibition space were
available, the material already on hand would permit a very interesting
and fairly complete exhibit in these directions, but unfortunately it is
impossible under the circumstances to provide room for more than
a limited number of objects, consisting chiefly of personal relics of
illustrious statesmen and soldiers.

The most interesting addition to the collections during the year con-
sists of a number of utensils and objects of wearing apparel used in
New England during colonial times. They illustrate in a very satisfae-
tory manner the customs and costumes of the seventeenth and eight-
eenth centuries. The donor is Mr. John B. Copp, Old Mystic, Conn.
Among other accessions are: A sword belt presented to Admiral 8. D.
Trenchard by the Government of Great Britain for his services in res-
cuing the officers and crew of the British bark Adiew off Cape Ann,
Massachusetts, in August, 1856; an old Spanish sword of the kind
used by the Conquistadores in Santo Domingo; a sword from Puerto
Rico bearing the date 1796; early Spanish spurs from Argentina and
San Domingo; a collection of early Spanish-Mexican copper and silver
coins; a cabinet containing 102 plaster casts of historic medals and

cameos, presented by Rev. Dr. L. T. Chamberlain; a waistcoat supposed
to have belonged to Gen. George Washington, deposited by Mrs. J. A.
Rodgers, South Bethlehem, Pa.; a canteen carried through the Revolu-
tionary war by John Paulding, one of the captors of Major André,
deposited by Gen. Rk. W. Meade; a collection of South Carolina colo-
nial paper money, and another of silver, nickel, and copper coins of
Mexico, Danish West Indies, Great Britain, and Switzerland, received
from Mr, A. W. Carey, Adrian, Mich.; a sword and epaulets worn by
Capt. Seth Britt Thornton, U. S. A., at Contreras during the last
attack on the City of Mexico; decorations and papers of the late Joseph
Smolinski, commander of the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Medjidish,
Chevalier of the Polish Military Cross, ete., deposited by his son Joseph
Smolinski, of Washington, D. C., and a model of the Behaim globe,
the original of which was made at Nuremburg in 1487.

In all, 298 specimens were added to the collection during the year.

Collection of musical instruments.—For reasons explained in previous
reports, no attempt has yet been made to permanently install this col-
lection, which is now one of the largest in the world. A considerable
number of instruments were obtained from several foreign exhibits at
the World’s Columbian Exposition, and these have been catalogued
and either installed in the long wall cases on the east and west sides of
the north hall or have been placed in storage.

No accessions of special value have been received during the year.
Mention may be made, however, of 2 instruments from Ceylon and 5
from Johore, Malay Peninsula, purchased from the Field Columbian
Museum; a native lyre from Congo, Africa, received from Mr. J. H.
Camp; a Japanese vertical flute, a transverse flute, and a double whistle
from Mr. Simon A. Stern, of Philadelphia, Pa.; a vertical flute from
New Hebrides, a horn from Friesland, Holland, a virginal made in 1602
and a Broadwood piano, from Mrs. J. Crosby Brown; a wooden bell, or
logo, from Mr. H. J. Moors, of Apia, Samoa; a flageolet and an oboe
from Tibet, presented by Dr. W. L. Abbott; a guirro (a sort of whistle),
from Puerto Rico, and a tiple (a small guitar), from the same locality,
presented by Mrs. Charles B. Smith, of Washington, D. C.

The collections of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial objects.—
These collections are the outgrowth of the establishment of a section of
the department of arts and industries in 1888, under the honorary
curatorship of Dr. Paul Haupt, of the Johns Hopkins University, for
the accumulation and preservation of objects illustrating oriental anti-
quities and ceremonials connected with religious worship of all kinds.
Dr. Cyrus Adler, librarian of the Smithsonian Institution, is in charge
of these collections, and under his immediate care they have been
arranged. They now occupy four alcoves in the east and west halls, near
the rotunda. The north alcove in the east hall contains the Egyptian col-
lections, arranged in eight cases. The Assyro-Babylonian collections
are in the south alcove in the same hall, also arranged in eight cases.
92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In the north alcove of the west ball are the Jewish, Mohammedan, and
Greco-Roman religious collections, while in the south alcove, opposite,
are arranged the religious objects relating to Brahmanism, Buddhism,
and Shintoism.

The principal additions during the year were a Siamese edition of
the sacred writings of the Southern Buddhists, presented by the King
of Siam; the liturgy of the Bene Israel of Bombay in the Maratha lan-
guage, presented by Rev. Henry Cohen, Galveston, Tex., and a Jap-
anese temple drum, deposited by Dr. G. Brown Goode. The Museum
is also indebted to Mr. R. Dorsey Mohun, United States consul at Zan-
zibar, for copies of the Koran, a Koran stand, and prayer mats, and to

tev. Henry Cchen for four volumes of Jewish liturgy.

Casts of the Temple stone, Siloam inscription, and twelve Assyrian
seals were sent to Rey. C. C. Newton, Tokyo, Japan, in exchange for
Buddhistie and Shinto objects.

Much progress has been made in the installation of the objects now
on exhibition. This matter is referred to more in detail in the chapter
entitled ‘‘The development and arrangement of the exhibition series.”
All of the collections not on exhibition have been rearranged and put
in storage cases. The molds and casts have been placed in the base-
ment of the Smithsonian building, where they are safe and easily
accessible,

Dr. Adler has commenced a study of Jewish ceremonial institutions.
He has also continued his study of ancient oriental seals, and in this
work has had the opportunity of examining a large collection of seals
belonging to Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. Casts were made
of 82 of these specimens. He has also completed a paper on the ‘“Cot-
ton Grotto near Jerusalem and ancient Methods of Quarrying.” This
is based partly on objects which he has presented to the Museum.

It is Dr. Adler’s desire to gather a collection of Hittite casts and a
series of amulets.

During the year 171 specimens were received. The entries in the
catalogue were contained between numbers 154816 and 154990.

IV.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE
DEPARTMENTS.

FINANCE, PROPERTY, SUPPLIES, AND ACCOUNTS.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk, presents, in his annual report, a detailed
statement showing the amount of the appropriations for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1835, and the disbursements thereunder; also the dis-
position of the unexpended balances remaining on hand from the
appropriations of previous years. These statements are printed in
Appendix VIt.

The work pertaining to the accounts connected with the disburse-
ment of the funds allotted to the National Museum, for an exhibit at
the Cotton States aud International Exposition at Atlanta, has entailed
considerable extra work upon the force of this office during the present
year. This work, however, as well as the preparation of orders for
materials and labor, has been performed without any additional help.

In the early part of the fiscal year steps were taken with a view to
bringing suit against persons who declined to enter into contracts
which had been awarded them for furnishing supplies, ete. ‘The opinion
of the Attorney-General was sought, and although the Smithsonian
Institution has not up to this time been recognized as being entitled to
this privilege, the action taken resulted in suits being brought against
the defaulters by the Department of Justice.

A board was appointed August 15, 1894, to examine and report upon
the safety of the alcohol and alcoholic specimens stored in the base-
ment of the Smithsonian building. Additional safeguards were recom.
mended, and these have been provided.

A new telephone service, with metallic circuits and long-distance
instruments, was installed during the year, and although the service is
much improved, the annual rental charged is less than that formerly
paid.

The chief clerk states that the rules adopted last year for the govern-
ment of the watch force have been adhered to, and that as a result the
force has been brought to a higher state of efficiency.

The committee appointed to consider the subject of an improved sys-
tem of locks for the Museum cases, submitted its report at the close of
the preceding fiscal year, and during the present year preliminary steps
have been taken with a view to carrying out the recommendations made.

93
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The quarters occupied for storage having been found too small for the
purpose, a new building was leased on the 15th of June of the present
year, and the transfer made a short time thereafter.

In February, 1895, an order was issued defining more particularly the
duties of the engineer.

The chief clerk makes a statement in his report regarding the records
of his office, from which the following is taken:

The originals of all requisitions for purchases, etc., are bound into
volumes of convenient size, for ready reference. A record is kept of all
bills and vouchers for expenditures on account of appropriations, and
every such bill or voucher has a reference to the number of the requisi-
tion authorizing the expenditure. Applications for leaves of absence
are filed in this office, and a record is kept of those granted, also of all
matters pertaining to the personnel of the Museum, except applications
for employment, which, after receiving proper action, are filed in the
office of the Secretary. Applications for the use of the lecture hall and
the stereopticon are also duly recorded. The files of the office contain
letters on all subjects pertaining to administrative and financial mat-
ters. Letters and documents of all kinds are given a distinctive num-
ber, and the letters are carefully indexed under the name of the writer
and the subject, the card system being used. When two or more let-
ters relate to one subject, they are given the same number and are filed
together. It is intended eventually to enter upon the card catalogue
all letters contained in the press-copy books, as well as those received
and filed. One series of press-copy books contains letters relating to
general Museum business, another contains letters pertaining to the
personnel of the Museum, and in still another series are copied letters
addressed to the Secretary, transmitting vouchers for payment. There
is in this office, also, a record of all legislative matters relating to the
Museum, and complete sets of books of estimates, digests of laws, ete.

DIVISION OF CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

This branch of the administrative work remains under the charge of
Mr. R. I. Geare. The force is practically the same as last year,
although the occasions upon which it has been necessary to call upon
this office for assistance in matters outside of its own work have been
much more numerous than in any previous year. There has been an
increase of over 1,000 in the number of letters and other official papers
prepared for signature, compared with the preceding year.

A special feature of the correspondence has been in the direction of
obtaining accessions to the library of the National Museum. Special
circular letters were prepared and invitations extended to the State
universities, agricultural colleges, and experiment stations, as well as
to a number of foreign institutions and scientific societies, to exchange
publications with the Museum or to complete partial sets already in
the library. The result of the correspondence has been very grati-
fying.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 95

e

Circulars have been prepared for transmission to specialists receiving
the Museum publications requesting them to send their own writings
in exchange, and at the same time inquiring whether our sendings are
regularly received, whether they are properly directed, and whether
the continuance of their transmission is desired. This information
will be of value in revising the mailing lists. It has been thought
inadvisable to distribute the circular until it shall be determined
beyond doubt what number of individuals and institutions ean with
certainty be retained upon the lists. This can not be definitely settled
until it shall be seen whether Congress is willing to remove the restric-
tion imposed in the printing act of January 12, 1895, limiting the
edition of the Proceedings and Bulletin to 1,000 copies, or one-third of
the customary number.

Among the numerous records kept in this division, those of greatest
importance in connection with the work of the office are as follows:

Two ecard catalogues showing the course of letters received at the
Museum—one, of letters coming to the Museum direct or by reference
from some other departinent or bureau of the Government; the other,
of letters referred to the Museum by the Smithsonian Institution. For
the more important letters received from the Institution, a separate
register is kept by numbers.

In connection with the press-copying of official papers there are ten
separate classes of books in constant use, besides several groups of
books containing the correspondence relating to expositions, congresses,
and other public functions in which the Museum has participated. In
addition to the index which each book contains, a general index in the
form of a card catalogue is kept. On each ecard or group of cards is
summarized the entire correspondence with each individual or institu-
tion. This catalogue, which is estimated to contain at least 35,000
cards, is one of the most valuable records of the office. On it the names
of correspondents, as well as of persons whose names occur in the cor-
respondence, are arranged alphabetically. A supplementary catalogue
of the names and addresses of foreign correspondents, arranged geo-
graphically, is also preserved.

A separate record is kept of the acknowledgments of material
acquired by the Museum, of reports upon objects sent to the Museum
for identification, and of the transmission of material to institutions
and to individuals for purposes of study; and, in addition, a record of
the-transmission of material to specialists for determination, as well as
of exchanges with museums in foreign countries and with individuals.
The results of cooperation with the Museum in special directions, on
the part of the Executive Departments and bureaus of the Government,
are also recorded.

The accession catalogue contains the name and address of each
contributor, together with a detailed statement of the nature of the
material received, and other useful information, such as the date of
entry, the number assigned, etc. The record of material sent to the
96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Museum for examination and report is similar in scope. These records
are published each year in the Annual Report. During the present
yer a separaterecord has been kept of material received for exhibition
at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta.

The correspondence with educational institutions regarding the dis-
tribution of collections forms the subject of a special catalogue. The
cards in this catalogue are arranged alphabetically by States and sub-
alphabetically by cities and towns. A short abstract is given of the
contents of each communication received from applicants for collee-
tions, and also of each letter sent out from the Museum. All applica-
tions for specimens are also entered in chronological order upon a
separate register.

The records relating to the distribution of Museum publications are
quite voluminous. The mailing lists are classified as follows: (1) the
list of domestic and foreign libraries which receive the Museum
teports, Proceedings, and Bulletins (embracing about 2,500 names);
(2) the list of foreign correspondents receiving the Museum Report
(embracing about 2,000 names), and (5) the lists of individuals and insti-
tutions receiving publications upon one or more special subjects
(embracing in all about 3,000 names). Card catalogues corresponding
to these lists are preserved. Upon the catalogues corresponding to
the first two is recorded, in convenient form, information regarding
the relations of the Museum with the libraries and institutions listed.
The lists referred to under the third heading consist of the names of
the recipients of the Reports, Proceedings volumes, and Bulletins, and
of separate papers from the Proceedings and Reports; also of the
names of specialists receiving papers upon one or more of a variety of
subjects. Hach list has its corresponding card catalogue. A separate
record is kept showing to which lists each publication of the Museum
has been distributed. In the case of publications sent in compliance
with individual requests, the orders are copied in press-copy books
kept for that purpose.

Typewritten lists of the papers published in the Proceedings,
arranged (1) by serial number, (2) alphabetically under the name of
the author, and (3) according to subject-matter, have been prepared,
and are of great importance in responding to the requests of appli-
ants for papers on various subjects. A separate list has also been
prepared referring under (1) name of author, (2) subject, and (3)
locality to all zoological, paleontological, botanical, geological, and
anthropological papers published by the Smithsonian Institution and
its various branches. This is found very useful in connection with
the Museum correspondence.

All letters relating to Museum matters, with the exception of those
bearing upon the finances and personnel of the Museum, are filed in
this office. A series of special files, arranged separately, is also kept
(1) for letters received trom the various departments and bureaus of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. bs L

the Government, (2) for letters received from officials of the Museuin,
(3) tor reports of the scientific and administrative officers of the
Museum, (4) for cross-references to letters from institutions and estab-
lishments, (5) for letters relating to explorations in the results of which
the Museum expects to participate.

By means of card catalogues are also recorded references to all let-
ters containing unaccepted offers to present, deposit, exchange, or sell
specimens to the Museum. This record has been found very useful
in supplying information to curators who may at any future time
be desirous of obtaining material which for some reason could not be
accepted at the time it was offered.

Distribution of publications.—The transmissions of publications to
applicants making special request by letter have surpassed in number
those of any preceding year, and it is safe to say that the regular and
special sendings have aggregated upward of 35,000 publications,
including volumes and separate papers.

Much attention has been given to the revision of the mailing lists.
Record of the date of publication of each volume and pamphlet issued
has been maintained, and is of frequent service for reference, as is also
the catalogue record of lists of specialists to whom publications have
been mailed.

By direction of the Secretary of the Institution, a copy of each pub-
lication, as soon as issued, 1s mailed to publishing houses representing
the Institution as agents in London, Paris, Berlin, Leipsic, and Milan.

The innovations mentioned in the report for the preceding fiscal
year, especially regarding the distribution of publications direct from
this office, have proved satisfactory. The regular distributions to the
persons on the permanent lists are still made from the document room.
The special sendings forwarded from this office are recorded on slips
printed for the purpose, with the name of the person or institution
supplied, the address, the serial number of the publication, and the
date of mailing. When the sending comprises both Smithsonian and
Museum publications, the package is transmitted from the Smithsonian
building, and a slip is filled out similarly to the above, with the addi-
tion of the name of the person upon whose recommendation the send-
ingismade. These slips are press-copied in books reserved exclusively
for this purpose, and constitute a permanent record.

More than 4,000 labels have been written in connection with the
distribution of the Smithsonian allotment of the Museum Reports for
1891 and 1892 to institutions in the United States and abroad.

The Museum Report for 1892, Bulletin 48, and Circulars 45, 44, 45,
and 46 were issued during the year. Proceedings papers Nos. 951-1031
were distributed in pamphlet form, and also advance sheets of Nos. 1040
and 1041.

REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.

The data concerning these branches of the administrative work are
taken from the report of the registrar, Mr. 8. C. Brown.

There were received during the year 30,511 packages of all kinds,
including material for addition to the collections, publications, and sup-
plies. These figures, as compared with those for the preceding year,
show a decrease of about 19,000. This decrease is readily accounted
for, however, when it is remembered that during the fiscal year 1893-94
the material returned from the World’s Columbian Exposition was
received and entered. There were 2,791 packages sent out, of which
694 contained specimens transmitted to educational establishments as
gifts, or sent to individuals or institutions in exchange, or for study.
A few specimens returned to owners are also included in this number.
The entries made on the incoming transportation record numbered
2,664, and on the outgoing transportation record, 719.

The number of accessions or lots of material received was 1,223, an
increase of 62 over the record for the preceding year. There were 467
“temporary” accessions, consisting of material received for identifica-
tion. An increase of over 12,000 is noted in the number of specimens
distributed, the total for the year having been 39,236.

The storage record shows that 554 packages were placed in storage,
while 113 packages were withdrawn by the curators to whose depart-
ments the material belonged. The storage rooms having become very
much crowded, it was found necessary to make arrangements for addi-
tional space, and in June, 1895, new quarters were secured, containing
more than double the floor space and three times the cubic capacity of
the quarters previously occupied.

Of the collections transmitted to educational establishments during
the year, a large proportion consisted of marine invertebrates, although
many specimens of rocks and ores, and casts of prehistoric implements
have been sent out, as well as a jimited number of minerals and fishes.
Lists of the specimens contained in the collections which have been
prepared for distribution since 1890 are printed in Appendix IX.

A detailed statement, arranged geographically, showing to what indi-
viduals and institutions specimens have been sent during the year,
either in exchange, as gifts, or for study, is given in Appendix x. The
number of lots of specimens sent out is here recorded:

The thanks of the National Museum are due to Messrs. George
Christall & Co., agents of the Trinidad Line of Steamers, for courtesies
extended in offering to transport collecting outfits and specimens to
and from Trinidad free of charge.

BUILDINGS AND LABOR; POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The superintendent of buildings, Mr. Henry Horan, mentions in his
annual report the more important features of the work accomplished
during the year by the force under his charge. An abstract of this
portion of his report is given in Appendix x1. Mr. Horan has also
submitted a statement showing the number of cases, fixtures, ete.,
made, altered, or repaired, the amount of fuel, gas, and ice consumed,
a list of articles lost and found in the Museum halls, lists of the tools
in use in the various shops, and a table showing the number of feet of |
telephone and other electric wire installed.

WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.
TAXIDERMISTS.

Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, reports that the following
mammals were mounted during the year, but owing to pressure of other
work were not emtirely finished: A Texas hare, a marsh hare, an Angora

goat, a Japanese goat, two guinea pigs, and a few other small mammais.
A limited number of mounted specimens, including the head of a water
buffalo, a pangolin, a flying squirrel, and a mole rat, were repaired and
put on new stands.

All mammals dying from the effects of confinement at the National
Zoological Park are now received by the taxidermist and by him turned
over to the osteological preparator or to the department of birds, rep-
tiles, or mammals, as the ease may be. The total number of mammals
received in the flesh during the year was 84, nearly one-half having
come from the Zoological Park, as will be seen from the following table:

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 101

Mr. William Palmer spent a portion of the months of February and
March in making collections in the Kissimmee River region of Florida.

A model of the Tower of Babel was prepared by Mr. Joseph Palmer
for exhibition at the Atlanta Iixposition in connection with the exhibit
of the department of oriental antiquities under the direction of Dr. Cyrus
Adler. He was also occupied in assisting in the preparation of lay
figures and of exhibits of reptiles and birds.

Casts were made of a collection of 318 Assyrian seals, transmitted
by Dr. Frederick Stearns, of Detroit, Mich. A large number of casts
of cetaceans were cleaned and repaired, and the contents of the rooms
in the basement of the Smithsonian building in which the molds are
stored, were thoroughly overhauled. All of the tanks and pickled
skins were removed from the shed near the Fish Commission building
to one of the sheds south of the Smithsonian building. The location
of the quarters rented for storage purposes and for workrooms was
changed near the ciose of the year.

Mr. J. M. Stowell, of the Leland Stanford Junior University, and
Mr. Meklroy, of Washington, spent several weeks in the shops of the
taxidermists, studying the methods of work.

Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department of birds, cleaned
and renovated about 4,000 specimens in the exhibition series during
the year. He also skinned 225 alcoholic birds and dismounted about
150 specimens. Forty-two fresh specimens were skinned and about
50 specimens were mounted for the exhibition series.

OSTEOLOGIST.

The osteological work has consisted mainly in the preparation of
material for the study series. Although a number of specimens have
been prepared for exhibition, it has been impossible, owing to pressure
of other work, to mount more than a small portion of them. The work of
preparing a restoration of a skeleton of Zeuglodon for the Cotton States
and International Exposition at Atlanta interfered greatly with the
regular work of the osteoiogist. Three months of the timeof Mr. J. W.
Scollick were spent in developing portions of the skeleton on which the
restoration was based.

Hight hundred and eighty-one skulls were cleaned for the depart-
ment of mammals, and a considerable amount of time was spent in pre-
paring specimens for the use of Professor Cope in connection with the
preparation of a work on the reptilia of North America.

PHOTOGRAPHER.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer, reports that 759 negatives were
made during the year, also 227 platinum prints, 1,231 silver prints, 25
ceyanotype prints, 10 bromide enlargements, and 6 lantern slides.
Twenty-nine prints were mounted. <A large portion of this work was
done for the departments of ethnology, prehistoric anthropology,
botany, mammals, geology, and marine invertebrates. The care of the
photographie collection and other work of a miscellaneous character,
including the testing of a number of different kinds of ink, in order to
determine the most suitable for the use of the Museum, occupied con-
siderable time.

COLORIST.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler continued the work of cleaning and restoring
some of the pictures contained in the Catlin collection of Indian paint-
ings. About one hundred of these have received attention up to the
present time. He also continued his work on the series of paintings
representing the races of man. Some miscellaneous work was accom-
plished, including the painting of lay figures for the department of
ethnology, and the retouching of a series of photographs of Pembroke
College, England.

In this paper the genus Gnathodon, which,
hitherto, has held a very uncertain place in
systematic classification, is placed by the au-
thor in the Mactride, on account of the char-
acters of both the shel] and the soft parts, and
it is shown that the young shell is essentially
mactroid. The synonymy of the species,
notes, and descriptions are given.

Am. Journ. Sci., XLVI, Oct., 1894, pp.
297-301.

This paper enumerates for the first time the
fossils of the Miocene beds of Marthas Vine-
yard, and describes two new species. The
Pliocene is recognized in the beds above the
Miocene and a list of the species found in it is
given. It is shown that the Ashley marls of
South Carolina and the phosphatic rock which
overlies them are probably Miocene and not
Eocene in age, as hitherto supposed. A list of
species from the phosphate rock is given,

which includes the characteristic Miocene |

type Ecphora quadricostata.

This paper consists of a set of notes on a
small lot of material sent to the Smithsonian
Institution some years ago by Dr. J.J. Brown,
of Sheboygan, Wis., from Watling Island,
Bahamas; another small lot from the same
place, collected by the U.S. Fish Commission,
and a third lot collected by Dr. Alexander
Agassiz. The lagoon species are peculiarly
thin, small in size, and, when colored, quite
brilliant. Notes are given on 12 marine and
16 land species and varieties, of which 5 are
new. The genus Cerion (formerly called Stro-
phia) is divided into subgenera founded on
characters of the internal laminz.

ner Free Institute of Science, 11, 1890, p. 58. Mr.
Dall shows that in those Gastropods which
have plicate apertures the adductor muscle,
which is attached to the columella, is placed
deeper within the shell than in the non-plicate
forms; that in such cases the body of the ani-
mal covered with its mantle is compressed as
it is being drawn into the shell and therefore
longitudinal wrinkles are formed in the mantle.
The secreting surfaces deposit shelly material,
which, in the folds, takes the form of ridges in
the aperture of the shell.

A new classification of the Pelecypoda.

Trans. Wagner Free Inst. Sci., 1, pt. 11,
Mar., 1895, pp. 483-570.

The author in 1889, in a ‘‘Catalogue of the
shell-bearing mollusks of the southeastern
United States,” proposed a new classification
of the Pelecypoda. This paper is an amplifi-
cation of that work, bringing it down to the
present date, but conforming to the general
principles on Which the earlier classification
was founded. In this system the shell, the
anatomy, the embryology, and evidence from
all sources are considered and made use of. A
brief dissertation on the shell, anatomy, and
functions of the Pelecypoda is given. Then
follows an enumeration of the orders, subor-
ders, superfamilies, and families of the Pele-
eypoda, each of which is differentially defined
in a manner enabling a direct comparison to
be made between groups of the same rank.
Under each family is given its range in geo
logical time and a list of the principal genera
believed to be referable to it. Some notes on
the principles of nomenclature applied in the
work and an index to the genera are appended.
The importance of this paper lies in the revi-
sion of the diagnostic characters, which are
endeavored to be made strictly comparable in
the different groups, and when common fo a
larger group are not repeated in the definitions
of its subordinate divisions; and in the bring-
ing up to date of the data employed,

and characteristics of the Lampreys.
Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., xvu, No. 989, July

Ammocetes is suppressed as a generic name,
and shown to be a stage common to all arcto-
gean lampreys. Petromyzon and Lampetra
are named as the longest established genera
and their synonyms enumerated. The families
Mordaciids and Petromyzonidw are defined
and justified.

— An Australasian subfamily of fresh
water Atherinoid fishes.

Am. Naturalist, xxvyiul, No. 332, Aug. 14,

The genus Nematocentris should be called by
the prior name Melanotenia, and the genus
Aristeus of Castelnau (not Duvernoy) is re-
named Rhombatractus. Both belong toa fresh-
water Australasian subfamily newly named
Melanoteniine, and are closely related.

— A new bassalian type of crabs [Re-

The genus Archeoplax of Aleock and Ander-
son (not Stimpson) is renamed etropluma and
recognized as the type of a peculiar family of
Grapsoidea—Retroplumide.

Rangia the proper name of the Mac-
troid genus Gnathodon.
Nautilus, vil, No. 9, Jan. 1, 1895, pp. 102-
103.

The name Gnathodon had been used in ich-
thyology earlier than conchology, and con-
sequently its use is precluded in the latter
department. Therefore the name Rangia, gen-
erally used by recent conchologists, should be
retained.

— The genus Leptophidium [renamed
Lepophidium).
Am. Naturalist, Xx1x, No. 338, Feb., 1895,
pp. 167-168.

The name Leptophidium was used by Hal-
lowell in 1860, and consequently Leptophidium
of Gill (1863) should receive another name;
Lepophidium is proposed.

— Pithecanthropus erectus.
Nation, Lx, Feb. 7, 1895, p. 105.

The genus Pithecanthropus is claimed to be
undistinguishable, so far as the characters
have been given, from Homo, and certainly no
characters have been adduced to justify family
differentiation.

On the Torpedoes.
Science (New series), I, No. 18, May 3, 1895,
pp. 502-503.

It was shown that the name Torpedo was
first applied (by Forskal in 1775) as a generic
term to the electric catfish of the Nile, subse-
quently called Malapterurus, and that for the
Torpedo rays Blainville’s name, Narcobatus,
must be revived.

pp. 457-459.

The family of Branchiostomide has five
genera successively named Branchiostoma,
Hpigonichthys, Asymetron, Paramphioxus, and
Amphioxides. Amphioxides is a new name
proposed for Branchiostoma pelagicum, The
term Actinomimes is proposed for the so-called
rays of the Branchiostomids and the so-called
ventral fins are designated the Sympodium.

to a distinct genus, which should be called
Neoceratodus. The ancient forms referred to
the former belong to at least two genera, Cera-
todus and Anticeratodus (new).

MASON, Oris Turton—Continued.

The object of this paper is to study the man-
ufacture, the ethnographic, and the geographic
distribution of all the types of bows, arrows,
and quivers among the North American tribes.
The plan has been to treat these objects as
specimens of natural history, and 10 consider
their structure, function, and distribution on
the line of environment and of evolution or
elaboration, in a series of explanatory pages.
Each separate piece is described as minutely
as possible, so as to render the specimens in
question types for future investigation.

middle. The warp threads pass alternately
between the slats and through the holes, and
this enables the weaver toshiftthe warp. The
question is raised whether the Pueblo Indians
invented this apparatus or received it from the
Europeans.

The figure of ‘‘ The American Dipper”’ is
by Dr. Shufeldt, being a copy of the one given
by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway in their ‘‘ His-
tory of North American Birds.” <A brief de-
scription of the bird, its nest, and its habits
are given, and the author's former opinion as
to its affinities are restated, to the effect that
in so far as anatomical structure seems to indi-
cate, the nearest American ally of Oinclus is
the Oven bird (Sturus).

done by more recent writers.

Gives instances |

of their breeding in burrows inthe ground, and |

also the case cited by Bendire from the account
of Mr. Emerson, of Haywards, Cal., where a
pair of these owls laid twenty-four eggs on the
tin roof of a house, where, completely unpro-
tected, they spoiled. Anexcellent and reduced
copy of Brehm’s figure of this bird is presented.

An adverse view of the work of a now no-

and collectors of the eggs of birds, especially
those of North America. The book 1s full of
errors, and apparently was written to give
scientific coloring to the unprincipled dealings
of its author. :

Many of the misstatements in the volume
were detected by studies of the unrivaled
collection of eggs of the birds of this country
in the U.S. National Museum.

pp. 1, 2, Aug., 1894.
Reprinted from Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., Mar.
20, 1894, pp. 250-251.

This is simply a brief abstract from the au-
thor’s original MSS. giving an account of the
osteology and affinities of this group of birds.
It is based upon a study of the material in his
private collection and also that of the U. 8.
National Museum.

A scheme of classification is presented that
divides the suborder Paludicole primarily into
two superfamilies, viz: the Gruoidea and the
Ralloidea. The first named contains the fam-
ily Gruide, represented by the genus Grus;
and the family Aramide by Aramus. The
Ralloidea, with the single family Rallide, is
made to contain the genera Rallus, Crea, Por-
zana, Ionornis, Gallinula, and Fulica.

Giants among Woodpeckers.

Great Divide, x, No. 8, Aug., 1894, p. 189.
One figure in text.

A brief account of the Ivory-billed Wood
pecker, calling attention to the fact that by
the misinformed the Pileated Woodpecker is
frequently mistaken for the Ivory-billed, in
those parts of the country where both species
occur together. A good copy of Brehm’s fig-
ure of the bird illustrates this article.

—— The introduction of birds.

Great Divide, x1, No. 8, Denver, Colo.,
Aug., 1894, p.189. One figure in text.
Gives a brief and popular account of many
of the birds that have been introduced into the
United States from foreign countries, and in-
vites especial attention to the introduction of
the Capercally, of which species a figure of
the cock and hen illustrates the article. Mount-
ed specimens of this bird are to be found in the
exhibition series of the Museum, and these
were made use of in describing the appearance
of the two sexes,

—— Notes on some western animals.

Great Divide, x1, No.9, Chicago, Sept.,
1894, pp. 218-219.

Makes brief reference to quite a number of
western mammals and birds, describing their
habits and geographical range. Figures are
given of the Round-tailed Muskrat (Neojiber
Alleni), after True’s drawing in the Proceed-
ings U. 8. National Museum; of the Wood-
chuck (A. mona); and of the Canada Porcu-
pine (2 d. dorsatus).

SHUFELDT, Rosrert W. Notes on the

Steganopodes, and on fossil birds’ eggs.
Auk, XI, No. 4, New York, Oct., 1894, pp.
337-339.

Presents a scheme of classification for the
Suborder Steganopodes, based upon a study of
the osteological material representing that
group jn the author’s collection, and in the
collections of the U. S. National Museum.
The article is but an abstract from original
MSS.

Reference is also made in this article to such
specimens of fossil eggs of birds as have come
to the notice of the author, as those in the
collection of the U. 8S. National Museum, and
also those described by M. Alp. Milne-Edwards
and others.

Journalof Anatomy and Physiology, XX1x

(New series), 1x, pt. 1, London, Oct.

1894, article 5, pp. 21-43. Three figures.

This paper is an extensive and illustrated
abstract from the author’s unpublished MSS.
It is based upon the osteological material in the
collections of the U.S. National Museum, and
in his private cabinet, and such other material
as has been lent by the British. Museum and
British naturalists. A history of the various
proposed classifications of the group (Paludi-
cole) is presented ; also a synopsis of the osteo-
logical characters of Rallus, Aramus, and Grus
is given. Figures of the lateral views of the
skulls of a Rallus, of Aramus giganteus, and
of a Grus are also given.

Deep-sea fishes.
Great Divide, x1, No. 10, Chicago, Oct.,
1894, pp. 240-241. Five figures in text.
A popular account of deep-sea fishing in
various parts of the world, with descriptions
of many deep-sea forms. References are made
to the publications upon this subject by the
U. S. National Museum, and to the work
accomplished by the U.S. Fish Commission
and by British Naturalists in the Indian
Ocean. The Torch-fish (Linophryne lucifer) is
figured, as are also five of the deep-sea fishes of
India (after Alcock) viz: Neobythites steatiti-
cus, Odontostomus atratus, Bathypercis pla-
tyrhynchus, and Physiculus argyropastus.

—— The seventeen-year Cicada and some
of its allies.

Popular Science News, Xxviul, No. 10, New
York, Oct., 1894, pp. 154-155, with fig.
ures.

A somewhat extended account of the nat-
ural history of the Cicadidaw based upon per-
sonal observations of the author, upon the col-
lections inthe Departmentof Ertomology in the
U.S. National Museum, and the writings of
Riley, Packard, Kirby, and others. Numerous
figures are given of Cicada septendecim, €.
pruinosa, and Thopha saccata of Australia.

SHUFELDT, Roserr W.—Continued.
Figures of the eggs and metamorphoses of
these insects are also presented, together with
a drawing of the twig of a tree showing the
peculiar puncturing done by Cicadas.

— On the affinities of the Stegano-
podes: A correction.
Proe. Zool. Soc. London, Nov. 6, 1894, p. 608.
Makes a correction in the taxonomic scheme
proposed by the author for the Steganopodes
in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society
for 1894, p. 160. As corrected, the author 1s of
the opinion that the suborder Steganopodes is
divisible into three superfamilies, viz, the
Pelecanoidea, the Phaéthontoidea, and the Fre-
gatoidea. In the first superfamily are arrayed
the families Pelecanidxw, Phalacrocoracide, An-
hingide, and Sulidie; in thesecond, the Phaé-
thontide ; and in the last the Fregatidie.

— Pelicans.

Popular Science News, Xxvitl, No. 11, New
York, Nov., 1894, pp. 165-166. One fig-
ure.

This is a brief account of the natural history
of several species of Pelicans and their allies
in various parts of the world. Reference is
also made to the mythical legends about these
birds, and to such fossil Pelicans as have been
described by the author and others. The arti-
cle is illustrated by a good figure of the Brown
Pelican drawn by Dr. Shufeldt from the large
painting of that species by Audubon.

King snakes.
Observer, V, No. 11, Portland, Conn., Nov.,
1894, pp. 328-329. One figure.

Contains brief references to the various spe-
cies of King Snakes ( Ophibolus) of the United
States, as represented in the collections of the
U.S. National Museum, and described in its
publications.

A figure of a young king snake, Ophibolus
g. getulus is given. (From a photograph by
the author; natural size.)

— The photography of birds.
Great Divide, x1, No. 11, Chicago, Nov.,
1894, pp. 263-264. Three figures.

Good photographs of living specimens of
wild and domestic animals of all kinds, as
well as the various structures they build for
their habitation and the rearing of their
young, have proved of very great service to
naturalists, taxidermists, and many others. In
the present contribution Dr. Shufeldt deals
with the subject of the photography of birds,
the methods employed, and some of the many
difficulties to be overcome. Half-tone figures
of living specimens of the Screech Owl (Mega
scops), the Great Horned Owl (Bubo), and
Gambel’s Partridge (Calipepla) illustrate the
article. The last named was taken at the
U.S. National Museum.

—-~ Storks.
Nidologist, u, No. 4, Alameda, Cal., Dec.,
1894, pp. 45-47. Three figures in text.
222

SHUFELDT, Rosert W.—Continued.

Three half-tone figures illustrate this article,
being reproductions of photographs of the
Common White Stork of Europe (Ciconiaalba).
The most interesting one of these gives a
Stork in full flight the moment it quits its
nest, while the other two show them in differ-
ent attitudes. Brief popular accounts are
given of various species of storks found in

different parts of the world, and several |

legends in regard to some of them are also
referred to.

Grebes.

Popular Science News, xix, No. 1, New
York, Jan., 1895, pp. 3-4.

This is a popular account of the birds called |

Grebes, and their allies, based upon the au-
thor’s extended scientific work in the group,
in which latter the collections of the U. S.
National Museum have been very extensively
used. It gives the classification and relation-
ships of the Pygopodes, and makes constant
reference to those occurring in the United
States and elsewhere, as well as the probable
origin of the Loons and Grebes in time. Of

this it is pointed out that they are the descend- |

ants of a now extinct ancestral stock of birds,

from which those remarkable fossil forms of |

toothed divers of the Cretaceous beds of Kansas,

described by Marsh—the Hesperornithide— |

were an offshoot. Thearticle is illustrated by
a half-tone of the author, and figures of the

Horned Grebe, drawn by Dr. Shufeldt after |

Audubon.

—— [Letter to Editor.
fessor Coe. |

Popular Science News, Xx1x, No. 1, New
York, Jan., 1895, p. 7.

Sustains the opinion of Dr. Giinther, of the
British Museum, in that the Rattlesnake
(Crotalus) is incapable of sounding its rattle
when from any reason the interspaces between
the several individual rattles are filled with
water. This fact has been noted at the Zoolog-
ical Gardens of London in the case of these
reptiles. Professor Coe holds a contrary opin-
ion, based upon personal observation and ex-
periments with rattles taken from the snakes.

Reply to Pro-

— The Loons.

Popular Science News, Xx1x, No. 2, New
York, Feb., 1895, pp. 17-18. One figure
in text.

A popular description of the Loons of the
United States, their habits, plumage, and geo-
graphical ranges, much of the information
being derived from the specimens contained
in the collections of the U.S. National Museum.
Reference is made to the rarity of the Black-
throated Diver in the latter, of which species
there are no skins in the collection, and only a
few mounted examples.

A figure of Urinator arcticus is given, drawn
from one of these specimens.

SHUFELDT, Roserr W. Beauty from
an Indian’s point of view.

Cosmopolitan, vul, No.5, New York, Mar.,

1895, pp. 591-598. Nine figures in text.

In this contribution the question of the esti-

mation of female beauty in several of the tribes

of North American Indians is dealt with.

Descriptions, comparisons, and the reproduc-

tions from »bhotographs of a number of women

considered to be belles in the several tribes to

which they belong are given. Among these

are to be noted selections from the Lagunas,

| the Navajoes, the Zunians, the Apaches, the
Yumas, the Moquis, and the Mojaves.

To these descriptions (anatomical, anthro-
pological, and otherwise), are added accounts
of the various kinds of dress and trinkets worn
by these women as a matter of personal adorn-
ment.

—— Auks and their allies.
Popular Science News, XX1x, No. 3, New
York, Mar., 1895, pp. 33-34, with figures.
A great many of the skins and mounted
specimens, as well as all the osteological mate-
rial representing this group of birds in the col-
lections of the U.S. National Museum, have
been extensively studied by theauthor. Much
of this has already been published, while still
more remains in MSS. It is upon this that
the present popular article is based. The arti-
cle is illustrated with drawings by Dr. Shufeldt,
such as the Whiskered Auklet (after Ridgway),
| and the Great Auk. The latter was loaned by
the Century Company, the original having
appeared in The Century Magazine, where it
illustrated another article by the author (Jan.,

1886).

— On a method of modeling certain
invertebrata for museum exhibition.
Journ. Institute Jamaica, Xi, No. 2, Kings-
ton, Jamaica, Apr., 1895, pp. 170-172.
Presents a fairly complete account of the
methods employed at the U.S. National Mu-
seum to preserve and mount various forms of
invertebrates, both marineand terrestrial. The
modeling of an Octopus is given as anexample,
and the material used in making gelatin casts
is likewise described, and its formula pre-
sented.
Reference is also made to the mode of pre-
paring models from zoological figures and pho-
tographs of the specimens.

Some Fort Wingate reminiscences.

New Mexico.
Nidologist, 1, No. 8, New York, Apr.,
1895, pp. 102-105. Two plates.

In 1888-89 the author was stationed, as post
surgeon, at Fort Wingate, N. Mex., and during
the latter part of this period he passed through
the ordeal of a military court-martial, one of the
most famous in the history of this country. It
practically tested the question as to whether
or not an officer on duty could avail himself of
his spare time for the purpose of scientific
investigation.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

SHUFELDT, Rosert W.—Continued.

A varied collection was made at Wingate by
Dr. Shufeldt for the U.S. National Museum,
but the most of his time was given over to the
publication of his researches, the whole repre-
senting several volumes. <A portion of this was
published by the Museum, while the major
part of it appeared in London. A fine plate of
the ‘‘ Navajo church,” as well as one of the
author’s study at Wingate, illustrates the con-
tribution.

“Outliers ”’

Popular Science Monthly, xtv1, No. 6, New |

York, Apr., 1895, pp. 760-780. Ten fig-
ures in text.

Numerous types of birds still puzzle avian
taxonomers, and no unanimity of opinion yet
exists as to their affinities. Examples of these
may be seen in such forms as the Sun Bittern
(Eurypyga) and others.

In the present article nearly all of these
puzzling species are described and figured, and

the various opinions held by ornithologists |

upon their kinships are given in greater or
less detail. In his studies of these ‘‘outlying
types”’ Dr. Shufeldt made very extensive use
of the collections of the U. S. National Mu-
seum.

Modern taxidermy.

Am. Field, Xtvil, No. 20, New York and
Chicago, Saturday, May 18, i895, pp.
463-464, with two figuresin text; No. 21,
May 25, pp. 488-490, with six figures in
text.

Popular articles based upon the author's well-
known report upon ‘‘ Scientific Taxidermy for
Museums,’’ published by the U. S. National
Museum. The half-tones illustrating these
articles were made by the American Field Pub-
lishing Company direct from the original pho-
tographs taken at the Museum, and they con-
stitute a very useful series of zoological figures.

Gulls and their allies.

Popular Science News, Xx1x, No. 5, New
York, May, 1895, pp. 65-66, with figures.

Partly scientific in character, this popular |

account is based upon the author’s studies of
all the osteological and other material in the
collections of the U.S. National Museum, and
his private cabinet, illustrating the group of
birds known as the Longipennes and their
allies. The major portion of these researches
are in MSS. and ready for publication, with
numerous original figures.

The present article is illustrated by a good
electro cut of Ross’s Gull (adult male and young
female), redrawn by the author from J. H.
Ridgway’s colored plates in the Report of the
International Polar Expedition to Point Bar-
row, Alaska, by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A.

In general, a very favorable notice of the
work, the principal exceptions being that its
author is taken to task for not employing the
netric system for the purposes of measure-
ment; and secondly, that he perpetuates some
very antiquated notions in regard to the clas-
sification of some of the groups of birds. For
example, Mr. Chapman retains the Flamingoes
in an order by themselves, and yet places the
American Vultures (Cathartide) as a family
m the order Raptores, in total disregard of
what is now known of the structure of these
several forms.

— Some famous butterflies.
Great Divide, xu, No. 5, Chicago, May,
1895, pp. 104-105, with figures.
Contains more or less full descriptions of the
‘‘dead-leaf butterflies” of Java (Kallima para-
lekta) and its peculiar habits, and also the re-
lated species K. inachis, the first named being
figured. Brief accounts are given also of sev-
eral South American forms, as Dynastor napo-
leon, Buptychia tricolor, Perisama euriclea, and
others. The species last mentioned are fig-
ured, as wellas Leptocircus curious. Reference
is made by, the author to some of the Amer-
ican butterflies collected by him in New Or-
leans and now forming a part of the Museum
collection.

Nidologist, 11, No.10, New York, June 1895.

A favorable notice of a brief but none the
less important contribution to the pterylogra-
phy of North American birds.

After a careful study of the pteryloses of a
sufficient number of Owls and Goatsuckers,
Mr Clark naturally comes to the conclusion
“that the Caprimulgi are related to Striges,
and not very distantly either—probably a
branch from the early part of the Strigine
stem,” an opinion in which his reviewer most
fully concurs.

versity of America by Dr. Shufeldt (together
with a historical preface), during the month
of January, 1892. The entire field of biology
is reviewed with greater or less thorough-
ness, and as many biological laws conflict

Rome, these lectures met with very marked
disfavor from such quarters. Through the
operation of Catholic influence it was found
impossible for the author to print them, either
in Europe or America, until two years after
their delivery, and the reasons therefor are set
forth in the preface. Not a few references are
made to the work accomplished by the U.S.
National Museum and to its collections.

pp. 582-585.

A life history of Mimus polyglotius, contrib-
uted to Newton's Dictionary of Birds, and one
that has been very favorably spoken of by nota
few British ornithologists, notwithstanding the
factthatits authorsays: ‘‘ To compare him with
his only rival,the European Nightingale,seems
to me quite out of place, though I will say
that my faith in the powers of the Mocking-
bird is so firm, that I believe were he success-
fully introduced into those countries where
the Nightingale flourishes, that princely per-
former might some day wince as he was obliged
to listen to his own most powerful strains
poured forth with all their native purity by
this king of feathered mockers, the subject
of the present notice.”

SIMPSON, CHARLES TORREY. Types of

The types of Anodonta dejecta, Lewis, which
were in the National Museum collection, were
rediscovered by the writer in examining some
duplicate material, and prove to be the same as
his A. Mearnsiana from the Pacific drainage.
The locality, ‘‘ head of Arkansas River,” given
for Lewis’s types is no doubt erroneous.

form of P. nigrisquamata, named long ago by
Reeve.

-—— Distribution of the land and fresh-

water mollusks of the West Indian

region and their evidence with regard
to past changes of land and sea.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvur, No. 1011, Jan.

26, 1895, pp. 425-450, pl. xvI, figs. i-8.

In this paper some account is given of the

means of distribution of land and fresh-water

snails. The theory is advanced that the land-

snail fauna of the Greater Antilles is ancient

and has developed on the islands, which for-

merly were more elevated and united together

as well as to Middle America, and, by way of
the Bahamas, to South Florida; that a subsid-
ence separated the islands from each other
and from Middle America, leaving only the
summits of the mountains above the sea, and
that they have since, during a period of uplift-
ing, reached their present elevation; that the
land-snail fauna of the Lesser Antillesis closely
related to that of South America, and that
there is no evidence that the Lesser Antilles
have ever been united to the Greater Antilles.
These deductions are drawn largely from bio-
logical evidence.

Note on Unio oregonensis, Lea.
Nautilus, vit, No. 10, Feb., 1895, pp. 116-
118.
The four type specimens of U. oregonensis,
Lea are the only ones known, and the writer,
in carefully comparing them with other species,
discovered that they were identical with the
forms which Lea had named Unio Rowelli and
Unio MeNeili from Central America. The
locality of U. oregonensis (Oregon) is undoubt-
edly erroneous.

Unio ochraceus and U. cariosus.

Nautilus, vit, No. 11, Mar., 1895, pp. 121-

123. Two wood cuts.

In this paper an attempt is made to point out
the differences between the closely related
U. cariosus and U. ochraceus, and to show that
both are valid species. :

8vo, pp. 1-129, pls. I-xIVv.

The introduction (pp. 1-13) discusses the
systematic position of the group and its com.
ponents. They are divided into three tribes:
Helliini, Hermiini, and Hyphenini, and a syn-
opsis of the 19 genera is given (pp. 13-14).
The genera Pseudorgyia and Rivula are
excluded from the Deltoids. The main part of
the work (pp. 15-118) gives complete descrip-
tions of the genera and species, with full syn-
onymy, synoptic tables, and geographical
distribution. Seventy-three species are recog-
nized as valid (listed on pp. 119-120), of which
eight are described as new. Pls. I-1x give
excellent photo-engravings of all species, and
pls. X-XIV illustrate structural characters.

This paper describes early objects of primi-

them with those found in America. Dr. Ab-
bott’s finds of similar implements in the gravels
of the river terrace at Trenton, N. J., are com-
pared with the infructuous searches of other
persons in the same terrace. It is shown that,

the failure of an observer to find them in one
locality is no evidence that another observer
may not have found them in another locality.
Similar experiences of the best observers in
France and England are cited. Many imple-
ments of similar form and manufacture have
been found in nearly every State of the Union,
though practically all on the surface. This
does not, however, prove the existence of
Paleolithic man in America, but, as says M.
Boule, is ‘‘an argument in favor of their an-
tiquity which will greatly impress prehistoric
archeologists of experience.’ It will serve a
good purpose in stimulating further investiga-
tion, and prevent the formation of conclusions
before the search has been exhausted and the
evidence all in.

— Polished stone hatchets.
Archeologist, 111, No.1, Jan., 1895, pp. 8-14;
No. 2, Feb., 1895, pp. 43-50.

The polished stone hatchet is, more than any
other implement, the representative of man’s
culture during the Neolithic or Polished Stone
age. Man in this stage spread himself by
migration practically over the whole world,
and in so doing carried with him this imple-
ment more than any other. While the Paleo-
lithic age of prehistoric man is called the
chipped stone age, the chipping of stone-
cutting implements did not cease with it, but
was to some extent carried into the Neolithic
or Polished Stoneage. Some implements thus
chipped were ground to a sharp edge or point,
while others were left unground. The tools
used were hammer-stones and grinding-stones.
The processes are shown In six figures forming
a series, from the rudely chipped to the finely
polished hatchets. In the Paleolithic age the
material used was such as could be chipped,
while in the Neolithic age many stone imple-
ments of nonchipable material, like granite,
diorite, ete., were used. These had to be re-
duced to the required form by hammering or
pecking, called by the French martelage. The
hatchet was inserted in a handle of wood,
with the cutting edge on a line with the han-
dle. Many specimens, mostly from France and
England, have been found, which indicate this
as the general method of use. The National
Museum is the fortunate possessor of two
original specimens thus mounted, one the
property of Mr. Byron E. Dodge, of Wisconsin,
and the other of Mr. C. M. Crouse, of Syracuse,
N.Y. The universality of the polished stone
hatchet during the Neolithic period is shown
by the universality of the material used... On
the. seacoast and the islands fossil shells
were not infrequently employed. While no
two polished stone hatchets may be exactly
alike, each having been the handiwork of an
individual who apparently worked for himself
and without pattern, they are all capable of
being reduced to a few general types, and a
series taken from almost anv locality in the
United States would represent a similar series

from almost any other locality in the same
country, and would closely resemble a series
from any part of the world.

Ou the presence of fluorine as a test
for the fossilization of animal bones.
Am. Naturalist, xx1x, No. 340, Apr. 1895,
pp. 301-317; No. 341, May, 1895, pp.
459-456.

It is greatly to be desired that some test
should be discovered by which the antiquity
of animal, and especially human, bones might
be determined. This test is believed to have
been found in fluorine. It may not be certain
nor always equal, but if it furnishes, or prom-
ises to furnish, an aid in this direction, it is to
be studied, examined, experimented with, and
proved. Modern animal bones have but a
small percentage of fluorine, less than two-
tenths of 1 percent, whileit appears to increase
in quantity and proportion until in those of
the earlier geologic ages the proportion reaches
3 and ever 4 percent. This increase may be
different in different localities, but from analy-
ses of a large number of specimens it seems a
steadily increasing ratio, and therefore affords
a means of approximate determination.

Grooved stone axes.

Archeologist, 111, No. 5, May, 1895, pp.

155-157.

While the polished stone hatchet was almost
universal among prehistoric peoples, the
grooved stone ax is confined to the United
States.

When the prehistoric man of Europe desired
a heavier cutting implement than his polished
stone hatchet, he drilled a hole through the ax
and inserted a handle, sledge fashion. When

229

WILSON, THomas—Continued.

the prehistoric man of America wanted a simi-
lar implement, he made a groove around the
implement and bound it with a withe, which
served as a handle.

Some of these implements have the edge
placed transversely to the handle and so they
become adzes, and where the edge is curved
instead of straight they become gouges. The
same difference of detail in size, shape, form,
and material remarked among polished stone
hatchets have been found
stone axes.

—— Stone cutting implements.

Archeologist, 11, No. 6, June, 1895, pp.
179-185.

Rude notched axes resemble the grooved ax.
A notch has been prepared by chipping fora
withe or handle, the edges of which notch have
been hammered or pecked so as to destroy
their sharpness and permit the use of the
withe, but they are rudely chipped, and beyond
this show no traces of pecking and never of
smoothing or grinding. They are peculiar in
their shape and can not have been grooved
stone axes in process of manufacture, though
they may have been its evolutionary ancestor.
They are always made of material which can
be chipped—like flint, quartzite, rhyolite,ete. —
and seem never to have been made of non-
chipable material, as granite, diorite, ete.
They are found in many localities throughout
the United States.

LISTS OF DUPLICATE SPECIMENS PREPARED FOR DISTRIBUTION
TO EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENTS SINGE 1890.)

Within the past five years collections of minerals, fishes, casts of
prehistoric implements, rocks and ores, and marine invertebrates have
been distributed among a hmited number of educational establish-
ments in the United States. Although numerous applications from
high schools and the smaller colleges have been received, it has been
found necessary, aS a rule, to decline compliance. It is hoped, how-
ever, that before many years the Museum will be enabled to separate the
duplicate material in all of its departments and make it up into sets.
When this has been done, it will doubtless be possible to extend the
scope of distribution so as to include those grades which have not
hitherto been supplied.

LABELS FOR CASTS OF PREHISTORIC IMPLEMENTS DISTRIBUTED BY THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

[Prepared under the direction of Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator Department of Prehistoric
Anthropology.]

PALEOLITHIC AGE, EUROPE.

Drift period (Sir John Lubbock, Mr. John Evans):
Cave Bear period (Lartet); Chelléen epoch (de
Mortillet) ; Alluvium (Solomon Reinach).

These implements are the earliest known to
have been made by man. They are distributed
in almost every quarter of the globe. They are
found on the surface on hills and high table-lands,
but mostly in the gravels of the river valleys,
and consequently are believed to be of the same
age. They are found associated with the remains
of the extinct fauna of the Quaternary period
and were contemporaneous therewith. The char-
acteristic of the industry of this age is, that all
the stone implements were made by chipping or
flaking. Man knew not that rubbing one stone
against another would sharpen or polish it.

Study of Prehistoric Anthropology; Handbook
for Beginners,’ Report National Museum, 1887-88,

PALEOLITHIC AGE, UNITED STATES.

Implements similar in form, style, and mode of
manutacture to those from other countries have
been found in the United States, and they seem to
indicate a similar stage of culture, though tho
contemporaneity of neither the implements nor
the stages of culture to which they belonged
has yet been established so as to be universally
accepted; nor has the relationship of the men

| edges, pecked and roughened

who made or used them on the two hemispheres
been established. Yet the fact is undoubted that
the implements are practically the same. These
implements have been found to the number of
several hundred by Dr. Abbott in the gravels of
the Delaware River, as they were washed from
the glacial terminai moraine and deposited at
Trenton, N. J.; by Miss Frane E. Babbitt, in the
gravels of one of the terraces of the Mississippi
River, at Little Falls, Minn.; by Dr. C. L. Metz,
in the gravels of the Little Miami River at Love-
land, Ohio; by Dr. Hilborne T. Cresson, at White
River, Indiana, and in the Columbia gravels of
the railway cuts south of Chester, Pa. The asso-
ciation and condition of these finds would seem
to establish the antiquity of man’s occupationin
this country, and its contemporaneity with the
glacial epoch at least on the Atlantic Coast. Sim-
ilar implements have been discovered on the sur-
face in almost every State. (‘‘A Study of Prehis-
toric Anthropology; Handbook for Beginners,”’

mon.

The largest number of this class are flat or oval
pebbles of quartzite, ete., which have been used
by holding in the hand. The broken corners and
by numberless
strokes, are the only evidence of their use. Many

specimens show an intentional worked depression
in the center of one or both sides, and in some
instances this cavity is so well defined that it is
difficult to draw the line between hammers and
cup-stones. Some large 2nd heavy specimens
show a groove, as do the axes, which served for
an attachment of a handle. These are called
mauls. Other classes of hammers are the flint
pebbles peculiar to Flint Ridge, Muskingum
County, Ohio, and those from the Pacific Coast:

RUDE NOTCHED AX.

A rough, chipped stone ax or adze, notched on
both edges; many specimens showing that the
notches were used by means of a withe or thong
for the attachment of a handle. These are found
principally on the Atlantic Seaboard from Massa-
chusetts to Georgia. It has been suggested that
they were used in making the ‘‘dug-out ” canoes.

GROOVED STONE AXES.

These are characteristic implements of aborigi-
nal Indian industry in the United States, and
their distribution is general. They are peculiar
to this country, and do not belong to Europe.
Almost the only prehistoric grooved stone imple-
ments found there are mauls used in mining or
quarrying. The material in the United States
differs with the locality; but granite, trap, and
rocks which would not flake were used. Grooved
axes are made of water-worn pebbles as well as of
quarried rock. They were chipped and pecked
into shape and then smoothed or polished by
rubbing or grinding. Some were not polished
but only pecked. The handle was attached by
means of a withe or thong passing around in the
groove. Grooved axes may be divided according
to form, but there are no sharp divisions between
the classes. Peculiar forms are to be noted, of

hematite from the Mississippi Valley, or of

actinolite from the pueblos of the Southwest.
(Handbook, p. 647, fig. 22.)

These have been classified as follows:

I. Grooved, either wholly or partially, some

with projecting wings.

II. Flat back for insertion of tightening wedge.
IIL. Double-bitted.

IV. Hematite.

V. Actinolite from the pueblos of the South-
west.

POLISHED STONE HATCHETS.

These, frequently called ‘‘Celts,’’ and erro-

neously ‘‘ Fleshers’’ and ‘‘ Skin-dressers,’’ in the
’

United States, and ‘‘Thunder” or ‘‘ Lightning” |

stones in the Eastern Hemisphere, were possibly
intended for use similar to the grooved axes; and
the same remarks as to material, locality, and
mode of manufacture apply to one as to the other.
Although these vary greatly in form and size, yet
they were practically for the same use. They
were inserted in their handles as shown by No.
11479, which, though of stone, is like many
others of wood. These are the representative
implements of the Neolithic or Polished Stone
Age, and are found throughout the prehistoric
world. On the coast and islands they are often
made of shell. (Handbook, p. 645, fig. 20.)

COPPER IMPLEMENTS AND ORNAMENTS.

The North American Indians, although living
in the age of Polished Stone, made use of native
copper. It was chiefly obtained from the Lake
Superior region. Aboriginal mining has been
described by Mr. Charles Whittlesey in Smith-
sonian Contributions, Vol. xr. Native copper
has been found in New England, New Jersey, and
the mountains of Virginia and the Carolinas. If
is generally believed that the Indians did not
smelt or cast copper, but mammered their imple-
ments out of nuggets; yet itis possible that some
races or tribes had the knowledge of casting. The
implements of copper were principally hatchets,
knives, and spearheads, but there are elaborate
ornaments. (Handbook, pp. 666-667, fig. 40.)

GOUGES.

These are similar to the polished stone hatchets
in material, mode of manufacture, and in every
way except their gouge form. They were prob-
ably handled and used in the same manner. They
are more plentiful in, if not confined to, the
Atlantic States.
the West Indies are of shell.

ADZES.

These are, apparently, only a variation in form |

and use from the polished stone hatchet and
gouge. They are more rare. Their distribution
in the United States seems to be limited to the
northeast Atlantic and the northwest Pacific
coasts, but they have been found in other parts of
the prehistoric world. Their mode of hafting is
shown in fig. 21, Nos. 70and 71. (Handbook, p.
646.)

objects which indicate by their form a possibility
of being used as such. There is hardly enough
evidence, however, in their appearance to war-
rant this conclusion. Many of the points are
slightly broken, and in a few instances the edges
are smoothed; but nearly all are in their original
condition and show no signs of use. A member
of the Sioux Indian delegation at Washington, in
January, 1890, pronounced many of them to be
ornaments worn suspended from the neck. A
Mohawk Indian declared them to be amulets or
charms. (Handbook, p. 643, fig. 18.)

spear heads, from a broken one of which it is sup-

MORTARS AND PESTLES.

These implements were in common use by the
aborigines throughout the United States. Nearly
every material was utilized for mortars, but
stone was usual. One has been found in Cali-
fornia made of a fossil whale vertebra. Those
The metate of
Mexico is similar in purpose. These objects are
important in this, that while they have continued
in use within the knowledge of persons still liv-
ing, they have been found in the auriferous gray-
els of California at such depth and with such
associations as to be assigned to the Quaternary,
or even Tertiary, geologic period. If this be
true, they are the earliest known smoothed stone
implements made or used by man. Mortars are
not exhibited in this collection. (Handbook, pp.

DRILLED TABLETS.

These objects, which form a numerous class,
are of various shapes and careful finish, pierced
with one, two, or more holes. They are usually
made of slate, but other material was used. Dif-
ferent purposes have been ascribed to them,
but nothing certain is known. They may have
been pendants, amulets, or badges of distinction.
They are never brought to a cutting edge, and,
except in rare cases, show no signs of use. They
have been found on the breasts of skeletons of
antiquity in the United States. (Handbook,

INSCRIBED TABLETS.

These are extremely rare and are principally
found in mounds. Their inscriptions have never
been read, and the pretended translations are not
approved by students of prehistoric archwology.
A number of tablets have been reported of which
some are without doubt genuine, but the majority
are believed, or are contended to be, frauds. The
presumption would be against any newly found
tablet, and its genuineness must be established.
The best known tablets believed or accepted as
genuine are the Cincinnati Tablet (S. I. Contri-
butions to Knowledge, Vol. I, p. 274 et seq.);
Davenport Tablet, Short (‘‘ North American, Indi-
ans of Antiquity,” p. 38, et seq.); Grave Creek’
Tablet, McLean (‘‘The Mound Builders,” p. 91
et seq.).

SINKERS, PENDANTS, OR CHARMS.

This series shows various, though notall, kinds
of the objects. These are made of hematite or
hard stone, and are finely polished. Some sinkers
not shown are smooth, flat, shore pebbles, broken
on the edge so as to easily take and hold the line.
One has a hole in the top by which a line can be
attached; others have a groove, though very
slight; while some have neither groove nor hole.
Objects similar to these have been found witha
truneated butt. Their distribution throughout
the interior in greater numbers than on the lake
or sea shores adds to the difticulty of their clas-
sification and a knowledge of their purpose.

SPADE-SHAPED IMPLEMENTS.

These might be classed with the ceremonial
objects, as no practical use has been suggested
for them. Their rarity and restricted locality
would seem to indicate a purpose more ceremonial
than otherwise. Less than a dozen are repre-
sented in the collection of the U. 5. National
Museum, the majority coming from Tennessee;
northern Georgia and northeastern Arkansas
furnishing one specimen each. They are always
polished, and the spade portion is never brought
toa sharp cutting edge. The material of which
they are made is always compact, fine-grained
stone, greenstone, chlorite, lydite, etc. (Hand-
book, p. 657, fig. 26.)

CEREMONIAL OBJECTS.

The purpose of these objects is purely conjec-
tural. For want ofa name indicating their use they
have been called variously, ceremonial objects,
banner stones, butterflies, etc. Their material is
usually too soft and fragile to have served as
cutting implements or weapons. They are not
sharpened to a cutting edge, and their signs of use
are rare, except that they are often broken. The
hole is too small for the insertion of a handle for
service. While some specimens are of slate and
other soft substances, indicating that they might
have been ornaments, yet others are of quartz,
jasper, syenite, and similar substances—hard, and
difficult to shape, polish, or drill. Some speci-
mens show only the rude form made by hammer-
ing and pecking; others, although finished by
polishing, are destitute of shaft holes, or merely
show their beginnings, demonstrating the fact
that in America (as in Europe) articles were first
brought to the required shape and afterwards
drilled. A large number of these objects are
found broken after being completely finished, both
by polishing and drilling, and in some cases the
blades or wings show perforations similar to those
in the tablets. This indicates a secondary use,
possibly as badges or ornaments, and so they
were considered of value, even when broken.

as charms or amulets seems the most probable.
A Chippewa Indian stated that they served for
gaming. They were placed in a flat pan or bas-
ket which, being covered, was shaken up and
down, then set down carefully, the cover removed,
and an inspection would show how many birds
were seated upright. He who had the greatest
number won the game. (Handbook, p. 651, fig. 25,

The title indicates our want of knowledge con-

were ‘‘a witch’s amulets for her transportation
over the water, as is the broomstick by the mod-
ern witch for flight through the air. If it was
lost, her power of flight or passage was gone.”

TUBES.

In the National Museum is a number of stone
tubes of cylindrical and other forms and different
lengths. Thesmaller ones, often only afew inches
in length, have been thought to be ornaments. A
variety of uses is ascribed to the larger objects,
the most plausible being that by the medicine
man for the pretended curing of diseases. Their
use for smoking or as whistles or calls has also
been suggested. The hole through the tube is
sometimes the same size throughout, having been

_ drilled from one end, and sometimes biconical,

having been drilled from both ends. Another
class has large, straight, cylindrical holes drilled
almost the entire length of the tube and then fin-
ished with one of asmall diameter. One specimen
in the Museum collection is 13 inches long and
terminates at one end in an expanding mouth-
piece (No. 7243). The materials are usually ste-
atite, banded slate, and chlorite, although speci-
mens of sandstone are not wanting. (Handbook,

used by the Indians in a game called ‘‘chungkee,”’

STONE OBJECTS FROM THE AURIFEROUS
GRAVELS OF CALIFORNIA.

These are tho enigmas of prehistoric man in
North Ameri¢a. If any reliance can be placed in
human testimony, we must believe that these,
with mortars and similar objects, came from
under the lava beds and belong to the early Quat-
ernary, if not the Tertiary geologic period. If
thus found they would seem to be the earliest
known implements made by man, and again they
are of the Neolithic or Polished Stone civilization,
and so belong to the more modern prehistoric man
in the present geologic period. These contradic-

tions must await the investigations of the geolo- |
gistand paleontologist as well as the archeologist. |

In our present knowledge it would be unwise to
announce any hard and fast theory.

PERFORATED STONE CLUB HEADS.

The objects forming this series in the Museum
collection have been mostly obtained from Indian
graves and from the surface of the Santa Barbara
Islands and the opposite Californian coast. Their
material is sandstone, serpentine, soapstone, etc.,
though specimens of harder material, such as
greenstone, have been found. They vary in size
and form, being from 14 to 5 inches or more in
diameter. There are some specimens only one-
half inch in thickness, while others are so thick
as to equal their diameter and give them a glob-
ular form. (Handbook, p, 655, fig. 28.)

THE WORK OF THE MECHANICS AND LABORERS.

The following condensed statement is made up from the report sub-
mitted by Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings, and is
intended to indicate, in a general way, the character of the work
performed by the members of the force connected with his department:

1894.

July.—A set of bookshelves was constructed at the west end of the lecture hall
for the use of the Museum library. All of the exhibition cases in the north hall
were thoroughly cleaned and the woodwork repolished. The model of the Zuni
Indian village was removed from the department of prehistoric anthropology to the
Museum building. New steam coils were placed in several of the halls of the
Museum, and the radiators in the northeast court and in the boat hall were placed
on the top of the wall cases recently constructed. Several exhibits in the section
of fisheries, including the deep-sea sounding apparatus, were taken down and sent to
storage.

August.—Exhibition cases were constructed in the room on the first floor of the
south tower of the Smithsonian building for the use of the section of physical appa-
ratus. Repairs were made to the floor in the lecture hall. The ‘‘ Quarry Group”
was transferred from the department of ethnology to the department of prehistoric
anthropology. The lecture hall was prepared for a meeting of the Association of
Agricultural Chemists, held August 23-25. Workmen were engaged for several days
in enlarging one of the chimneys in the northwest pavilion. In anticipation of the
meeting of the Knights of Pythias in this city, and the large number of strangers
expected, all of the cases were removed from the rotunda, in order that the crowds
might be handled more readily.

September.—A large radiator was placed in the paint shop, proper connections
being made with the boiler room in the Smithsonian building. Repairs were made
to the boilers in the Museum building, the work being performed by contract. The
east balcony and the adjacent offices were fitted up for the use of the National
Herbarium. The boiler and pump rooms in the Smithsonian building were cleaned
and whitewashed. Direct connections were made by telephone between the Museum
and the Department of Agriculture.

October.—The door-screen cases between the piers in the northwest range were
replaced by pier cases. Trenches were dug and steam pipes laid from the Smithso-
nian building to the Astro-Physical Observatory. All of the steam pipes in the
basement of the northwest pavilion were removed, and the heating apparatus in
the upper stories of this section of the building overhauled. Repairs were made to
the floor in the fisheries hall. The electric wires and batteries in the northwest
pavilion were overhauled, the wires in the Assistant Secretary’s office being placed
under the floor. The work of putting the east balcony into condition for the National
Herbarium, constructing and erecting cases, ete., was continued, Stationary book-
cases of oak were constructed in the office of the Assistant Secretary. The large
iron safe in the office of the chief clerk was set in the wall, in a space cut for the
purpose. Ventilators were placed in the telephone room and in the offices of the

superintendent and property clerk. SOF

308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

November.—A new switchboard was placed in the telephone room, and severai
additional instruments were installed in different parts of the building. New steam
pipes were placed in the office of the department of fishes. <A large exhibition case,
which had heretofore been in the center of the northwest court, was remodeled and
made into two wall cases, which will be set up in the section of oriental antiquities.
Several pier cases were set up in the mineral hall, in place of the door-screen cases,
which have been removed.

December.— All of the cases in the department of prehistoric anthropology were
thoroughly cleaned. The lecture hall was put in condition for the use of the Ameri-
can Historical Society, whose meetings opened December 27. Considerable work
was done in the southeast court, preparatory to its occupancy as the exhibition hall
of the paleontological department.

1895.

January.—W ork in the southeast court was continued. Anumber of screens were
altered, and these and the walls were painted. The plaster casts and models were
moved from the basement rooms under the north tower of the Smithsonian building.
The exhibition cases in the department of comparative anatomy were rearranged.
All of the oils and inflammable materials, which were formerly stored in the alcohol
room in the basement of the Smithsonian building, were removed to other quarters.

February.—A section of the mahogany wall case on the north side of the exhibi-
tion hall of the department of comparative anatomy was removed in order to pro-
vide an entrance to the southeast court from this side. The fire plug in the east-
south range was removed and placed just inside the entrance to the southeast
pavilion. The north and west basement rooms of the Smithsonian building were
fitted up with shelves and will be used for the storage of plaster casts and molds.
Watch boxes were placed in several of the outbuildings.

March.—A telephone instrument was placed in the carpenter shop, and connec-
tions made with the telephone room. Watch boxes were erected on the second floor
of each of the four balconies of the Museum building. Two fire plugs in the east
hall were removed and placed inside of the east entrance to the building. The loca-
tion of the fire plug in the fisheries hall was also changed.

April.—A force of men were engaged for several days in hanging the models of
Indian villages on the walls of the northwest court. A man was detailed from each
of the night watches for duty outside of the larger buildings, the object being to
give better protection to the sheds and outbuildings. A hose reel was placed just
outside the south entrance to the Smithsonian building, the hose being kept con-
stantly attached to the fire plug and ready for immediate use. A ladder and ax
have also been placed within easy reach, and connections with the telephone room
established, so that help may be readily summoned in case of fire.

May.—F¥or several days a number of men were engaged in rearranging the cases in
the mineral hall. Improvements were made in one of the rooms on the second floor
of the west balcony. It is proposed to place toilet rooms in the basement and on the
first and second floors of the south tower of the Smithsonian building. This work
was commenced about the middle of the month. A number of long-distance tele-
phones were put up by the telephone company in place of the old style of instru-
ment formerly in use. This change necessitated additional wires, as the new
instruments require a metallic circuit.

June.—An additional watch box was placed in the Museum carpenter shop. New
quarters for storage purposes were rented, and the work of removing material to
the new building oceupied considerable time during the month. Door-screen cases
were placed between the piers above the wall cases in the department of compara-
tive anatomy. The steam valves of the radiators throughout the buildings were
examined and a portion of them repacked, The boiler rooms and coal vaults were
thoroughly renovated and whitewashed,

THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS.

By FRANZ Boas.

PREFACE,

The following paper describes and illustrates the collections of the
U.S. National Museum referring to the social organization and secret
societies of the Indians of the coast of British Columbia. It is based
on studies made by the author during a series of years. The great body
of facts presented here were observed and recorded by Mr. George
Hunt, of Fort Rupert, British Columbia, who takes deep interest in
everything pertaining to the ethnology of the Kwakiutl Indians and to
whom I am under great obligations. Iam indebted to him also for expla-
nations of ceremonials witnessed by myself, but the purport of which
was difficult to understand, and for finding the Indians who were able to
give explanations on certain points.

My thanks are due to Mr. ©. O. Hastings, of Victoria, British
Columbia, who took a series of photographs, reproductions of which
will be found in this report. A series of phonographic records of
songs belonging to the ceremonials were transcribed by Mr. John ©,
Fillmore and myself. I also had opportunity to verify many of the
phonographic records by letting the Indians repeat the songs two years
after the records had been taken.

Ihave also to thank Prof. A. Bastian, director of the Royal Ethno-
graphical Museum at Berlin, Sir Augustus W. Franks, keeper of the
ethnographical department of the British Museum, Mr. Franz Heger,
director of the ethnographical department of the Imperial Royal
Museum of Natural History at Vienna, and Prof. F. W. Putnam,
curator of the department of anthropology of the American Museum
of Natural History at New York, for permission to use specimens con-
tained in the collections of these museums for illustrating the present
report.

The texts of Indian songs, phrases, and legends do not lay any claim
to philological accuracy. They are merely inserted here as authen-
ticating the translations and the material presented in this paper. It
may be that a further study of the songs will modify the transla-
tions in many respects. The obscurity of the songs is often very great,

and my knowledge of the language is not sufficient to overcome the
difficulties of an adequate translation.

I. THE INDIAN TRIBES OF THE NoRTH PaAciFic CoAgt.

The Pacific Coast of America between Juan de Fuca Strait and
Yakutat Bay is inhabited by a great many Indian tribes distinet in
physical characteristics and distinct in languages, but one in ecuiture.
Their arts and industries, their customs and beliefs, differ so much
from those of all other Indians that they form one of the best defined
cultural groups of our continent.

While a hasty glance at these people and a comparison with other
tribes emphasize the uniformity of their culture, a closer investigation
reveals many peculiarities of individual tribes which prove that their
culture has developed slowly and from a nunber of distinct centers,
each people adding something to the culture which we observe at the
present day.

The region inhabited by these people is a mountainous coast inter-
sected by innumerable sounds and fiords and studded with islands,
large and small. Thus intercourse along the coast by means of canoes
is very easy, while access to the inland is difficult on account of the
rugged hills and the density of the woods. <A few fiords cut deep into
the mainiand, and the valleys which open into them give access to the
heart of the high ranges which separate the coast from the highlands
of the interior, forming an effectual barrier between the people of the
interior and those of the coast. These fiords and their rivers and val-
leys offer comparatively easy access to the coast, and along these lines
interchange of culture has taken place. Extending our view a little
beyond the territory defined above, the passes along which the streams
of culture flowed most easily were Columbia River in the south and
the pass leading along Salmon and Bella Coola rivers to Dean Inlet
and Bentinck Arm. Of less importance are Chileat Pass, Stikine
River, Nass and Skeena rivers, and Fraser River. Thus it will be seen
that there are only two important‘and four less important passes, over
which the people of the coast came into contact with those of the
interior. Thus they have occupied a rather isolated position and have
been able to develop a peculiar culture without suffering important
invasions from other parts of America.

As the precipitation all along the coast is very great, its lower parts
are covered with dense forests which furnish wood for building houses,
canoes, implements, and utensils. Among them the red cedar (Thuya
gigantea) is the most prominent, as it furnishes the natives with mate-
rial for most manufactures. Its wood serves for building and carving;
its bark is used for making clothing and ropes. The yellow cedar, pine,
fir, hemlock, spruce, yew tree, maple, alder, are also of importance to
the Indians. The woods abound with numerous kinds of berries, which
318 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

are eagerly sought for. The kelp and seaweeds which grow abundantly
all along the shore are also utilized.

In the woods the deer, the elk, the black and grizzly bear, the wolf,
and many other animals are found. The mountain goat lives on the
higher ranges of the mainland. The beaver, the otter, marten, mink,
and fur seal furnish valuable skins, which were formerly used for blan-
kets. The Indians keep in their villages dogs which assist the hunters.

The staple food of the Indians is, however, furnished by the sea.
Seals, sea lions, and whales are found in considerable numbers; but the
people depend almost entirely upon various species of salmon, the hali-
but, and the oulachon or candlefish (Thaleichthys pacifieus, Girard),
which are caughtin enormous quantities. Various specimens of cod and
other sea fish also furnish food. Herrings visit the coast early in spring.
In short, there is such an abundance of animal life in the sea that the
Indians live almost solely upon it. Besides fish, they gather various
kinds of shellfish, sea urchins, and cuttlefish.

The people are, therefore, essentially fishermen, all other pursuits
being of secondary importance. Whales are pursued only by the tribes
of the west coast of Vancouver Island. Other tribes are satisfied with
the dead carcasses of whales which drift ashore. Sea lions and seals
are harpooned, the barbed harpoon point being either attached to a
bladder or tied to the stern of the canoe. The harpoon lines are made
of cedar bark and sinews. The meat of these sea animals is eaten,
while their intestines are used for the manufacture of bowstrings and
bags. Codfish and halibut are caught by means of hooks. These are
attached to fish lines made of kelp. The hook is provided with a
sinker, while the upper part is kept afloat by a bladder or a wooden
buoy. Cuttlefish are used for bait. The fish are either roasted over or
near the fire or boiled in wooden kettles by means of red-hot stones.
Those intended for use in winter are split in strips and dried in the sun
or over the fire. Salmon are caught in weirs and fish traps when ascend-
ing the rivers, or by means of nets dragged between two canoes. Later
in the season salmon are harpooned. For fishing in deeper water, a
very long double-pointed harpoon is used. Herring and oulachon are
caught by means of a long rake. The oulachon are tried in canoes or
kettles filled with water, which is heated by means of red-hot stones.
The oil is kept in bottles made of dried kelp. In winter, dried halibut
and salmon dipped in oil is one of the principal dishes of the tribes living
on the outer coast. Clams and mussels are collected by the women ;
they are eaten fresh, or strung on sticks or strips of cedar bark and
dried for winter use. Cuttlefish are caught by means of long sticks;
sea eggs are obtained by means of round bag nets. Fish roe, particu-
larly that of herring, is collected in great quantities, dried, and eaten
with oil.

Sea grass, berries, and roots are gathered by the women. The sea
grass is cut, formed into square cakes, and dried for winter use. The
same is done with several kinds of berries, which when used are dis-
solved in water and eaten mixed with fish oil, Crab-apples are boiled
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 319

and kept in their juice until Jate in the winter. They are also eaten
with fish oil. The food is kept in large boxes which are bent of cedar
wood, the bottom being sewed to the sides.

In winter, deer are hunted. Formerly bows and arrows were used in
their pursuit, but these have now been replaced by guns. The bow
was made of yew wood or of maple. The arrows had stone, bone, and
copper points. Bows and arrows were carried in wooden quivers. Deer
are also captured by being driven into large nets made of cedar bark,
deer sinews, or nettles. Elks are hunted in the same way. For smaller
animals traps areused. Deer and bears are also caught in large traps.
Birds were shot with arrows provided with a thick blunt point. Deer-
skins are worked into leather and used for various purposes, principally
for ropes and formerly for clothing.

The natives of this region go barelegged. The principal part of
their clothing is the blanket, and this was made of tanned skins or
woven of mountain-goat wool, dog’s hair, feathers, or a mixture of
both. The thread is spun on the bare leg and by means of a spindle.
Another kind of blanket is made of soft cedar bark, the warp being
tied across the weft. These blankets are trimmed with fur. At the
present time woolen blankets are most extensively used. At festive
occasions “button blankets” are worn. Most of these are light blue
blankets with a red border set with mother-of-pearl buttons. Many
are also adorned with the crest of the owner, which is cut out in red
cloth and sewed on to the blanket. Men wear a shirt under the blanket,
while women wear a petticoat in addition. Before the introduction of
woolen blankets, women used to wear an apron made of cedar bark and
a belt made of the same material. When canoeing or working on the
beach, the women wear ljarge water-tight hats made of basketry. In
rainy weather a water-tight cape or poncho made of cedar bark, is
used.

The women dress their hair in two plaits, while the men wear it com-
paratively short. The latter keep it back from the face by means of a
strap of fur or cloth tied around the head. Ear and nose ornaments
are used extensively. They are made of bone and of abalone shell.
The women of the most northern tribes (from about Skeena River north-
ward) wear labrets.

A great variety of baskets are used—large wicker baskets for carry-
ing fish and clams, cedar-bark baskets for purposes of storage. Mats
made of cedar bark, and in the south such made of rushes, are used for
bedding, packing, seats, dishes, covers of boxes, and similar purposes.

In olden times work in wood was done by means of stone and bone
implements. Trees were felled with stone axes and split by means of
wooden or bone wedges. Boards were split out of cedar trees by means
of these wedges. After the rough cutting was finished, the surface of
the wood was planed with adzes, a considerable number of which were
made of jade and serpentine bowlders, which materials are found in
Several rivers. Carvings were executed with stone and shell knives.
320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Stone mortars and pestles were used for mashing berries. Paint pots
of stone, brushes, and stencils made of cedar bark formed the outfit of
the Indian painter. Pipes were made of slate, of bone, or of wood.

Canoes are made of cedar wood. The types of canoes vary some-
what among the different tribes of the coast, depending also largely
upon whether the canoe is to be used for hunting, traveling, or fishing.
The canoe is propelled and steered by means of paddles.

The houses are made of wood and attain considerable dimensions.
The details of construction vary considerably among the various tribes,
but the general appearance is much alike from Comox to Alaska, while
farther south the square northern house gives way to the long house of
the Coast Salish. <A detailed description of the house will be given
later on.

The tribes comprising the North Pacific group speak a great many
different languages. From north to south we find the following lin-
guistic families, which are subdivided in numerous dialects, as follows:

I. Tlingit, inhabitating southern Alaska.

II. Haida, inhabiting Queen Charlotte Islands and part of Prince
of Wales Archipelago.

IU. Tsimshian, inhabiting Nass and Skeena rivers and the adjacent
islands.
1. Nisqa’, on Nass River.
2. Gyitkea’n, on upper Skeena River.
3. Ts’E/mecian, on lower Skeena River and the adjacent islands.
IV. Wakashan, inhabiting the coast from Gardiner Channel to Cape
Mudge, the region around Dean Inlet excepted; Vancouver
Island, except its southeastern part, from Comox to Sooke
Inlet; and Cape Flattery.
A. Kwakiutl group.
1, Xa-isla, on Gardiner and Douglass channels.
2. He/iltsuq, from Gardiner Channel to Rivers Inlet.
3. Kwakiutl, from Rivers Inlet to Cape Mudge.
B. Nootka group, inhabiting the west coast of Vancouver Island
and Cape Flattery.

V. Salishan, inhabiting the coast of the mainland and the eastern
part of Vancouver Island south of Cape Mudge, the southern
part of the interior as far east as the Selkirk Range, and the
northern parts of Washington, Idaho, and Montana; also the
region of Dean Inlet.

A. The Coast Salish.
1. Bi/lxula, on Dean Inlet and Bentinck Arm.
2. QGaLo/ltx, at Comox and Toba Inlet, formerly north of
Cape Mudge.
3. PE’nLatc, at Comox.
4. Si/ciaL, on Jervis Inlet.
5. Sqxo/mic, on Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet.
6. Qau/etein, on Cowichan River and lower Fraser River.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. BPA:

7. Lku’/igEn, on the southeastern part of Vancouver Island.
This dialect is nearly identical with the S’a/mie,
SEmia/mo, XLu’mi, and La/lam, the last of which is
spoken south of Fuca Strait, while the others are
spoken east of the Gulf of Georgia.

8. Nsqoa’li and affiliated dialects of Puget Sound.

9. Twa/nuX, at Union City, Puget Sound.

10. Sqau/elitsk, on Cowlitz River.

11. Sa/tsEpe, on Chehalis River.

12. Tsxé’lis, on Greys Harbor.

13. Kwi/naiuL, north of Greys Harbor.

14, Tile’muke, south of the mouth of Columbia River.

B. Salishan languages of the interior.

1. Nuak-a’/pamuX, on the canyon of Fraser River and the
lower course of Thompson River.

2. Sua/LiumX, on Douglas and Lillooet lakes.

3. SExua/pamuX, from Ashcroft to the northern extremity
of Okanagan Lake, the Big Bend of the Columbia,
and Quesnelle.

4, Okina/qén, with the closely related Kalispelm, Spokane,
Flatheads.
VI. Chemakum, south of Cape Flattery and near Port Townsend.

VII. Chinook, on Columbia River.

Among these languages, Tlingit and Haida on the one hand, Kwakiutl,
Salishan, and Chemakum on the other, show certain similarities in form
vhich induce me to consider these groups as more closely related among
hemselves than to the other languages.

The physical characteristics of the Indians of this region show also
hat they are by no means a homogeneous people. So far as we know
iow, we may distinguish four types on the coast of British Columbia:
The northern type, embracing the Nisqa’/ and Tsimshian; the Kwakiutl
ype; that of Harrison Lake; and the Salish of the interior, as rep-
‘esented by the Okanagan, Flathead, and Shuswap. The following
neasurements show the differences of types:

322 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The types expressed by these figures may be described as follows:
The northern Indians are of medium stature. Their arms are relatively
long, their bodies short. The head is very large, particularly its trans-
versal diameter. The same may be said of the face, the breadth of
which is enormous, as it exceeds the average breadth of face of the
North American Indian by 6mm. The height of the face is moderate;
therefore its form appears decidedly low. The nose is very low as
compared to the height of the face, and at the same time broad. Its
elevation over the face is also very slight only. The bridge is generally
concave, and very flat between the eyes.

The Kwakiutl are somewhat shorter, the trunks of their bodies are
relatively longer, their arms and legs shorter than those of the first
group. The dimensions of the head are very nearly the same, but the
face shows a remarkably different type, which distinguishes it funda-
mentally from the faces of all the other groups. The breadth of the
face exceeds only slightly the average breadth of face of the Indian,
but its height is enormous. The same may be said of the nose, which
is very high and relatively narrow. Its elevation is also very great. |
The nasal bones are strongly developed and form a steep arch, their
lower end rising high above the face. This causes a very strongly
hooked nose to be found frequently among the Kwakiutl, which type
of nose is almost absent in all other parts of the Pacific Coast. This
feature is so strongly marked that individuals of this group may be
recognized with a considerable degree of certainty by the form of the
face and of the nose alone.

The Harrison Lake type has a very short stature. The head is
exceedingly short and broad, surpassing in this respect all other forms
known to exist in North America. The face is not very wide, but very
low, thus producing a chameprosopic form, the proportions of which
resemble those of the Nass River face, while its dimensions are much
smaller. In this small face we find a nose which is absolutely higher
than that of the Nass River Indian with his huge face. It is, at the
same time, rather narrow. The lower portion of the face appears very
small, as may be seen by subtracting the height of the nose from that
of the face, which gives an approximate measure of the distance from
septum to chin.

The Salish of the interior have a stature of 168cm. Their heads are
shorter than those of the tribes of Northern British Columbia or of
the Indians of the plains. Their faces have the average height of the
Indian face, being higher than that of the northern type of Indians,
but lower than that of the Kwakiutl. The nose is high and wide, and
has the characteristic Indian form, which is rare in most parts of the
coast.

The social organization of the tribes of the coast shows considerable
variation. The tribes of the northern parts of the coast have a mater-
nal organization, while those in the south are purely paternally organ-
ized. The central tribes, particularly the Kwakiutl, show a peculiar
transitional stage.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. S20

The Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Héiltsuq have animal totems.
The first of these have two phratries, the raven and wolf among the
Tlingit, raven (Q’oa/la) and eagle (G-itkna’) among the Haida. The
Tsimshian have four totems—raven (Qanha‘da), eagle (Laxskiyek),
wolf (Laxk-ebo’), and bear (G-ispawaduwE'da); the Héiltsuq three
raven (Q0/ix'tenox), eagle (Wi'k’oaqx'tén6dx), and killer whale (Ha/1x’-
aix'ténox); the Xa-isla’ six—beaver, eagle, wolf, salmon, raven, killer
whale. Animal totems in the proper sense of this term are confined to
these five groups or tribes. They are not found among the Kwakiutl,
although they belong to the same linguistic stock to which the Xa-isla
and Héiltsuq belong. The clans of the northern tribes bear the names
of their respective totems and are exogamous.

It must be clearly understood, however, that the natives do not con-
sider themselves descendants of the totem. All my endeavors to
obtain information regarding the supposed origin of the relation
between man and animal have invariably led to the telling of a myth,
in which it is stated how a certain ancestor of the clan in question
obtained his totem. The character of these legends is uniform among
all the peoples of this region; even farther south, among the Kwakiutl
and the northern tribes of the Coast Salish, who have no animal
totem in the restricted sense of this term. The ideas of the Kwakiutl
regarding these matters will be described fully later on. As these
legends reveal the fundamental views the natives hold in regard to
their totem, I shall give abstracts of a few of them.

The following is a legend of the Tsimshian:

The Bear Clan.—An Indian went mountain-goat hunting. When he
had reached a remote mountain range, he met a black bear, who took
him to his home, taught him how to catch salmon, and how to build
canoes. For two years the man stayed with the bear; then he returned
to his own village. The people were afraid of him, because he looked
just like a bear. One man, however, caught him and took him home.
He could not speak and could not eat anything but raw food. Then
they rubbed him with magic herbs, and gradually he was retransformed
into the shape of a man. After this, whenever he was in want, he
ealled his friend the bear, who came to assist him. In winter when
the rivers were frozen, he alone was able to catch salmon. He built a
house and painted the bear on the house front. His sister made a
dancing blanket, the design of which represented a bear. Therefore
the descendants of his sisters use the bear for their crest.

It is evident that legends of this character correspond almost exactly
to the tales of the acquisition of manitows among the Eastern Indians,
and they are evidence that the totem of this group of tribes is, in the
main, the hereditary manitow of a family. This analogy becomes still
clearer when we consider that each man among these tribes acquires a
guardian spirit, but that he can acquire only such as belong to his clan.
Thus, a person may have the general crest of his clan and, besides, use
as his personal crest such guardian spirits as he has acquired. This
accounts partly for the great multiplicity of combinations of crests
which we observe on the carvings of these people.

324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The more general the use of the crest in the whole clan, the remoter
the time to which the elan legend is ascribed. In many cases the inci-
dents are considered comparatively recent, and are then confined to the
descendants of the person whom thé legend concerns. The extreme case
is the narrative of acquisition of one of the crests of the clan by a single
person.

These ideas necessitate that we find the clans or phratries subdivided
and that there exists a multiplicity of crests for each phratry. As an
illustration of this phenomenon, I will give a list of the crests and clans
of the Stikine tribe of the Tlingit:

Orests of the raven phratry: Raven, frog, goose, sea lion, owl, salmon,
beaver, codfish, skate.

Crests of the woif phratry: Wolf, bear, eagle, killer whale, shark,
auk, gull, sparrow hawk, thunder bird.

The phratries of the Stikine tribes are subdivided as follows:

Families of the raven phratry:

Qasx’ague‘de. Crest: Raven.

K-iks’a/dé. Crest: Frog.

Qate’a‘dé. Crest: Raven.

Tir hit tan (=bark house clan). Crest: Beaver.
DeéLqoe/dé (=people of the point). Crest: Raven.
Qagan hit tan (=sun house clan). Crest: Raven.
xéLqoan. Crest: Beaver.

Families of the wolf phratry:

Nanada’ri or siknax’a/dé (corresponding to the Kagonta/‘n of other
Tlingit tribes), subdivided as follows:
Hara’‘e hit tan (=porch house clan).
Tos hit tan (=shark house clan).
Q’et go hit tan.
xuts hit tan (=bear house clan).
Xoge/de. Crest: Killer whale.

The list is probably not complete, but it shows the character of these
subdivisions. Similar subdivisions, although less numerous, are found
among the Tsimshian.

The crest is used for ornamenting objects belonging to a member of
the clan; they are carved on columns intended to perpetuate the mem-
ory of a deceased relative, painted on the house front or carved on a
eolumn which is placed in front of the house, and are also shown as
masks in festivals of the clan. It is impossible to draw a sharp line
between the pure crest and figures or masks illustrating certain inci-
dents in the legendary history of the clan. In order to illustrate this
point, which is of great importance in the study of our subject, | will
describe a few examples observed among the Nisqa’ Indians.

The G-ispawaduwe’da, the bear clan of the Nisqa’, use a headdress
representing the owl (maskutgunu’‘ks) (Plate 1),-surrounded by many
small huinan heads called gyad Em Laqs (claw men). This is worn in
potlaches, and commemorates the following tradition :

A chief at T’Emlax’a/mt had a son who was crying all the time. His
father became impatient and sent him out of the house, saying, “ The
EXGReAIN AT NO NOI PAE alr

The headdress is made of maple; eyes, tougne, eye ornainent on wings, and orna-
ment at base of the wing feathers inlaid in Haliotis shell. Wings and eyebrows of
owl, and eyebrows, eyes, and noses of the surrounding men painted black; margin
of beak and body of the owl except knees and talons, mouths, arms, and legs of
¢he surrounding men, and the broad band surrounding the owl’s body painted red.

white ow] shall fetch you.” The boy went out, accompanied by his sis-
ter. Then the owl came and carried the girl to the top of a tree. The
people heard her crying, and tried to take her down: but they were
unable to climb the tree. After a while she ceased to ery, and married
the owl]. They had a son. When he grew up, she told her husband
that.she desired to send her son home. Then the owl made a song for
him. His mother told him to carve a headdress in the Shape of an
owl for use in his dance, and to sing the song which his father had
made for him. She bade him farewell, telling him that her husband—the
owl—was about to carry her to a far-off country. The owl carried both
of them to the old chief’s house. When the wife of the latter saw the
unknown boy, she was afraid; but her daughter reassured her, and told
her that the boy was her grandson. Then the old woman took him into
her house, while the owl and the boy’s mother disappeared. When the
boy was grown up, his mother’s brother gave a festival, and before pres-
ents were distributed among the guests the boy danced, wearing the
owl headdress and singing the following song which his father had com.
posed for him:

326 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

When the G-itxq’ad6/q branch of the Qanha’da have a festival, three
masks make their appearance, one of which has a mustache and rep-
resents a young man named G-itgod/yim (Plate 2, upper figure), while
the other two are called Ca‘ca (Plate 2, lower figures). They represent
the following tradition:

While the people were staying at the fishing village Gulg-é/uL, the
boys, under the leadership of a young man named G-itgo6/yim, made a
small house in the woods behind the town. They took a spring salmon
along and played with it until it was rotten. They caught small fish
in the creek and split and dried them. They made small drums and
began to sing and to dance. For four days they stayed there, dancing
all the time. Then they became supernatural beings. G-itgo0’yim’s
hair had turned into crystal and copper. The people were about to
move to another camp and went to fetch the boys, whom they heard
singing:

That is: Where the copper hair, where the ice hair is spread out, is

As soon as the people approached them they disappeared and were
seen at once dancing and singing at a distant place. The people were
unable to reach them. Then they returned, and since that time the
G-itx'q’ad6’q have used the song and dance of these boys.

As an example of the use of the crest, viz., of the legend of the clans
in the erection of memorial columns, I will give the following: A man
had the squid for his protector. After his death his son gave a festival,
in the course of which the ground opened and a huge rock which was
covered with kelp came up. This was made of wood and of bark. A
cave was under the rock and a large squid came out of it. It was made
of cedar bark and its arms were set with hooks which caught the blan-
kets of the audience and tore them. The song of the squid was sung
by women who were sitting on three platforms in the rear of the house:

Qagaba/xskk laxha/ hayai, qagaba/xskkE laxha’ hayai.

After the squid and the rock had disappeared again, a man wearing
the sun mask appeared in the door, and when the people began to sing
his song, a movable sun which was attached to the mask began to turn,
The sun belongs to the G-ispawaduwE’da; the squid commemorates the
misfortunes of one of the ancestors of the deceased, who, when hunting
squids at ebb tide, was captured by a huge animal. His friends tried
to liberate him, but were unable to do so. When the water began to
rise, they pulled a bag of sea-lion guts over his head, hoping that the
air in it might enable him to survive, but when they looked for him at
the next tide they found him dead.

After the festival a memorial column was erected. It represented,
from below upward, first four men called Loayo’qs, or the commanders,
These are a crest of the Gispawaduwk’da. Tradition says that one
night some men for some purpose dug a hole behind a house near a
grave tree. They saw an opening in the woods and a fire in the middle
of it, around which ghosts were dancing. They were sitting there as
though they were in a house, but the men saw only a pole where the
door of the house would have been. Four men called Loayo’qs were
standing at the door, and called to them nagwi’t! (to this side). Since
that time the G-ispawaduwE’da have used these figures.

On top of the four men was the sea bear (mEdi’ek Em ak:s) with three
fins on its back. Hach fin has a human face at its base. The tradition
of the sea bear tells how four brothers went down Skeena River and
were taken to the bottom of the sea by Hagula’q, a sea monster, over
whose house they had anchored. His house had a number of platforms.
Inside were the killer whales, Hagula’q’s men. He had four kettles
called Lukewarm, Warm, Hot, Boiling, and a hat in the shape of a sea
monster, with a number of rings on top. The name of his house was
Helaha‘idkq (near the Haida country). He gave the brothers the right
to use all these objects and with them their songs, which are sung at all
the great ceremonies of the clan. The song of the house is as follows:

Hagula’q also gave them two cradle songs, which are sung for the

children of the clan, and also at funerals:

ALgwa/sEm guna’‘t, aLgwa/sEm guna’/t, aLgwa’/sEm guna’t.

II. THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE KWAKIUTL.

The wakiutl are divided into a great many tribes, which are in

their turn subdivided into septs and clans. Each clan of the Kwakiutl
proper derives its origin from a mythical ancestor who descended from
heaven, arose from the under world, or emerged from out of the ocean.
Their crests and privileges, which will be discussed later on, are based
upon the adventures of their ancestors, from whom they are supposed
to have descended.

13e. Q’o’m’enox.

This list is not quite complete, but very nearly so. A number of the
clans are subdivided into smaller groups, but it is very difficult to
ascertain these subdivisions. Thus the Naq6/mg-ilisala embrace a sub-
division called Mé/Emaqaua, who are, however, not considered a separate
clan. The Laa-uiLEla of the La/Lasiqoala are divided into two divi-
sions—the G”’ég’’0/te, the descendants of G-’0/te, and the Ha‘heqola,
the descendants of Ha/qolaL. The La/alaxsEnt’aio of the Kwakiutl
proper consist of three divisions: The La/alaxsEnt’aid proper, the
A‘Ik’unwéE (=lower corner, speakers of the first division), and the
Hé/ha’mé'tawé, the descendants of Ha’me’tawe. The Ts’E/nts’Enx-qaio
of the Wa‘las Kwakiutl are divided in two divisions—the 'Ts’E/nq’am
and Hai/maaxsto. These divisions are given merely as examples, as I
have not been able to discover all the subdivisions of the different
clans and tribes.

The recent history of these tribes and clans explains the develop-
ment of this exceedingly complex social system. Historical tradition
has it that the Gué/tEla and the Q’o/moyué, both septs of the Kwakiutl,
not very long ago formed one tribe. At one time a quarrel arose
between them, in which La/qoagvila, the head chief of the Gue’txla,
was killed. Then they divided, and since that time form two septs.
There is a saying indicating the close relationship of the two, to the
effect that the Gue’trla and the Q’6/moyué are twins—the former suckled
at the mother’s right breast, the latter at the left.

Still another tribe, which, however, I have not included in the above
list on account of its recent origin, has branched off from the Kwakiutl.
These people call themselves Ma’tilpe, i. e., the highest Maa/mtag-ila,
and include the septs Maa/mtag-ila, G-e/xsEm, and Haai’/lak-Emae, all
of which are found among the Gue’tEla and Q’0’/moyue.

While in these two cases new tribes were formed by a process of
division, in one other case, at least, a tribe has recently become a clan
of another tribe, namely, the Laa/luis of the Le/kwilt6q, who have
joined the Kué/xa of the same group and form a fourth clan of the
latter. The event happened during the great war with the southern
Salishan tribes, which was waged in the middle of this century, the
cause of the amalgamation being the great reduction of the tribe.
The Q’o'/m’énox have become entirely extinct. Another tribe which
lived near the Qo’sqémox, of which, however, we have only traditional
reports, the Xoya‘les, have been exterminated by the Qo’sqemox.

These few authentic facts show that the numbers of tribes and of
clans have undergone considerable changes during historical times.
This conelusion is corroborated by the distribution of clans among
various tribes, and by the meaning of their names. We may distinguish
three classes of tribal names and of clan names, viz, such as are
collective forms of the name of the ancestor, names taken from the
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 333

region inhabited by the tribe or clan, and names of honor. There is a
decided tendency to substitute names of the last class for others.
Thus the name Q’o’moyue (the rich ones) is new. The Xa/xamatsEs
took the name Wa/litsum (the great ones) only twenty-five or thirty
years ago. I presume that the names G-i/g:ilqam (those who receive
first), G-é/xsEm (chiefs), TE’/mLtEmLEIs (those under whom the ground
shakes), were adopted in a similar way. Other changes of names
occur. Thus the Nimkish call themselves recently Lao/koatx, which
is the name of one of the tribes of the west coast of Vaneouver Island,
and the Lau/itsis are adopting the name T's’a’/mac, which is the name
of the Songish in the Comox dialect.

The geographical names are more suggestive. We find among the
Nimkish aclan called Ne/nélk’énox, the people from the head waters of
Nimkish River. This would seem to indicate that the head waters of
the river was their ancient home, and that they have joined the rest
of the Nimkish. The same may be said of the O/manits’én6x clan of
the 1’a/sq’enox, the Qoe’qoaainox of the T’Ena’xtax, and the Né/nélpae
of the Qoe/xsot’enox,

In all cases where the clan name or the tribal name is a collective
form of the name of the ancestor, we may assume that the group
formed at one time a single community. How this unit may be broken
appears in the case of the Ma/‘tilpé. We observe that quite a number
of such clan names are common to several tribes. Thus the Si/sinLaée,
the descendants of Si/nLaé, are found among the Goasi’la, Na/q’oaqtoq,
Gue’tEla, Lau/itsis, and Nimkish. The Yaai’x‘-aqEmac, the descend-
ants of Yix-a/qEmae, are found among the Q’o’moyué and T’Ena’xtax.
I believe that in all these cases part of the original clan has drifted
away from its original home, keeping its old name. This view is sus-
tained by the tradition that the clans were divided at the time of the
great flood, one part drifting here, another there.

Still another case that gives evidence of the gradual development of
the present system of clans and tribes is furnished by the Ma/maleéle-
qala and Wi’weqae. Both these names are the collective forms of the
names of the ancestors. Nevertheless the Ma‘maléleqam and Wi/wéa-
qam, the Ma‘léleqala group, and the We’qaé group appear as subdi-
visions of these tribes. It seems to me that this proves that these
subdivisions must have formed the original stock, which the other clans
joined in course of time.

All this evidence proves that the present system of tribes and clans
is of recent growth and has undergone considerable changes.

The traditions of the clans show clearly what we must consider the
original unit of society among the Kwakiutl. Each clan derives its
origin from a mythical ancestor, who built his house at a certain place
and whose descendants lived at that place. Ina great many cases these
places prove to be old village sites. In some, large accumulations of

’ shells are found, which show that they have been inhabited through
Jd4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

long periods. We conclude, therefore, that the clan was originally a
village community, which, owing to changes in number or for pur-
poses of defense, left their old home and joined some other community,
retaining, however, to a certain degree its independence. This corre-
sponds exactly to the social organization of the Salishan tribes of the
southern portion of Vancouver Island, and of all the coast tribes of
Washington and Oregon. The simple division into village communi-
ties which seems to have been the prevalent type of society along a
considerable portion of the Pacific Coast has, among the Kwakiutl,
undergone such changes that a number of tribes which are divided
into clans have originated.

While it would be natural that in the former stage the child should
be considered a member of the village community to which his father or
mother belonged, we may expect disturbances in the organization which
developed among the Kwakiutl. Among the village communities of
Oregon, Washington, and southern Vancouver Island the child belongs
to the father’s village, where the married couple generally live, and it
seems that among many of these tribes the villages are exogamie.
Among the Kwakiutl the clans are also exogamic, and certain privi-
leges are inherited in the paternal line, while a much larger number
are obtained by marriage. The existence of the former class suggests
that the organization must have been at one time a purely paternal
one. Three causes seem to have disturbed the original organization—
the development of the more complex organization mentioned above,
the influence of the northern tribes which have a purely maternal
organization, and the development of legends referring to the origin of
the clans which are analogous to similar traditions of the northern
groups of tribes. Taking up the last-named point first, we find that
each clan claims a certain rank and certain privileges which are based
upon the descent and adventures of its ancestor. These privileges, if
originally belonging to a tribe which at one time has been on the paternal
stage, would hardly have a tendency to deviate from the law govern-
ing this stage. If they have, however, originated under the influence
of a people which is on a maternal stage, an abnormal development seems
likely. In the north a woman’s rank and privileges always descend
upon her children. Practically the same result has been brought about
among the Kwakiutl, but in a manner which suggests that a people
with paternal institutions has adapted its social laws to these customs.
Here the woman brings as a dower her father’s position and privileges
to her husband, who, however, is not allowed to use them himself, but
acquires them for the use of his son. As the woman’s father, on his
part, has acquired his privileges in the same manner through his mother,
a purely female law of descent is secured, although only through the
medium of the husband. It seems to my mind that this exceedingly
intricate law, which will be described in detail in the course of this
paper, can not be explained in any other way than as an adaptation of —
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 335

maternal laws by a tribe which was on a paternal stage. I can not
imagine that it is a transition of a maternal society to a paternal soci-
ety, because there are no relics of the former stage beyond those which
we find everywhere, and which do not prove that the transition has
been recent at all. There is no trace left of an inheritance from the
wife’s brothers; the young couple do not live with the wife’s parents.
But the most important argument is that the customs can not have
been prevalent in the village communities from which the present
tribal system originated, as in these the tribe is always designated as
the direct descendants of the mythical ancestor. If the village com-
munities had been on the maternal stage, the tribes would have been
designated as the descendants of the ancestor’s sisters, as is always
the case in the legends of the northern tribes.

Names and ail the privileges connected with them may be obtained,
also, by killing the owner of the name, either in war or by murder.
The slayer has then the right to put his own successor in the place
of his killed enemy. In this manner names and customs have often
spread from tribe to tribe.

It remains to substantiate what I have said by telling the legends of
a few clans. I shall give a fuller account of these legends later on,
while at this place I will merely refer to such passages as are of impor-
tance in our present consideration. The clan O/manits’énox of the
L’a/sq’enox derive their origin from Ts’i/lqoaloLEla, the husband of
L’ée/sElaqa (=Sun woman). The former came down from heaven while
his wife stayed there because she had to attend to the moving sun.
He was accompanied by his children Sé/paxaés (=Shining down),
Ya/q@EntEmaé (=First speaker), G-e/xdEn, and Da/doqanaqésEla
(=Seeing from one corner to the other). From these the clan origi-
nated (Appendix p. 665).

The following genealogy of the clan La/la-uiLEla of the La/Lasiqoala
is a still better example:

Nomasb/nxélis (descended from heaven).

A great number of examples of this kind might be given. It is true
that these traditions are probably not very old, and have been modified
with the changing social life of the people; but from what we know of
the development of myths we should expect to find in them traces, at
least, of the old maternal institutions, if they had ever existed. The
fact that they invariably and always are explained by genealogies, such
as the above, seems to my mind conclusive proof that a paternal
organization of the tribe preceded the present one.
336 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

I referred several times above to the fact that the clans have certain
rights in which the others do not share. These are mainly the use of
certain crests and of semi-religious performances. All of these are
acquired by marriage, as described above. In the village communities
of the southern tribes we find no trace of a crest, while among the
Kwakiutl it is not strictly hereditary, but descends through marriage
in the female line, in a similar way as the crest of the northern tribes
descends. ‘The legends of the acquisition of the crest are also similar
to the northern legends on the same subject, and I conclude, therefore,
that the present stage has developed through contact of these two eul-
tural areas. I do not mean to say that the ideas have been bodily bor-
rowed by the Kwakiutl, but that their manifestation in the social
organization of the tribe is largely due to suggestion on the part of the
northern tribes. The American idea of the acquisition of the manitou
was evidently also fundamental among the Kwakiutl, as all their tales
refer to it, and, as we shall see later on, the whole winter ceremonial is
based on it. But it hasassumed a peculiar form inso far as the manitou
was acquired by a mythical ancestor and is now handed down from gen-
eration to generation, and the connection has in many cases become so
slight that the tutelary genius of the clan has degenerated into a crest.
This degeneration, together with the descent through marriage, I take
to be due to the influence of the northern totemism.

I give a few stories illustrating the acquisition of the crest through
the ancestor, which will bring out the close analogy with the acquisi-
tion of the manitou, and also show the manner in which the crest is
used for adorning persons and utensils.

The legend of the O/manits’én6x, which I quoted above (Appendix,
p-665), goes on to tell how G-e/xdEn fell in with a number of killer whales,
which had assumed the shape of men, and were mending their canoes.
Their chief gave him the quartz-pointed whaling harpoon, his names,
and the right to use the painting of the killer whale on his house front.

Another good example is the following tradition of the clan La’xsé of
the Q’o/moyué or Kué’/xa. I give here a translation :

The first Kue’/xa lived at Tsa’/Xoyo. Their chief, Yé@/iqoLalasame,
we .t bear hunting up the river of .LiXsi/wé until he came to Sa/x-sox:,
After he had been away four days, he saw the Ho/Xhoq (a fabulous
bird, supposed to be similar to the crane) and heard its ery. It was
larger than aman. Then Ye/iqoLalasamé hid. The Ho/Xh6q tried to
find him, and finally discovered the place where the chief was in hiding
at one side of a cedar tree. It tried to peck him with its beak, but
missed him. Yé/iqoLalasamé merely jumped to the other side of the
tree, and the Ho’/Xh6q could not kill him. He came home at night.
Then he carved the crane out of yellow cedar, and now it is the
carving of his clan (Plate 3). He invited all the tribes, and gave away
cedar-bark blankets, all kinds of skins, canoes, and slaves. Then he
placed the ...age of the HO/Xh6q on top of a pole outside of his house.

Later on, a chief of the Qoé’xsot’éndx wanted to have the carved
Ho’Xhoq. His name was LEk-ama’xot. He tried to find out how to
obtain it, and learned that he had to marry the daughter of Y@/iqo-
Lalasamé in order to obtain it. Then he engaged himself to marry
Ma/xalayuqoa, that chief’s daughter. Ye/iqoLalasamé agreed, and they
were married. Still later NEqa/p’Enk:Em, chief of the K"kwa/kum of
the Gué/tEla, obtained the H6o’/Xh6q from the Qoe’xsot’endx by mar-
riage.

The first part of this legend shows again the close analogy to the
acquisition of the manitou; the end shows how the privilege of using
the carving was acquired, first by one tribe, then by the other.

It is not necessary to multiply these examples. There exists, how-
ever, another class of traditions, according to which the crests or
emblems of the clan are not acquired in this manner, but brought
down by the ancestor of the clan from heaven or from the underworld
or out of the ocean, wherever he may have derived his origin. This is
the case with the Si/sinLaé, whose emblem is the sun (fig. 1). Here
also belong the numerous tales of ancestors who came down from
heaven, took off their masks, and became men, for in all these cases
the mask has remained the crest of the clan. To this class belong the
traditions of the G-i/g:ilqam of the Q’o’/moyué, of the Ts’E/nts’Enxqaio,
and many others.

There is still another class of privileges connected with these tradi-
tions, to which, however, I will only briefly refer at this place, as I have
to treat them more fully later on. I mean the membership in secret
societies. Many ancestors, when obtaining their manitous, were given
the right to perform certain dances, or they were given secret songs, or
the power to eat human flesh. These rights havealso become hereditary,
but they differ from the crest in so far as the character of the initiating
spirit (the manitou) has been more clearly preserved. Hach individual,
who by descent or marriage is entitled to membership in one of the
secret societies, must nevertheless, be initiated by its presiding spirit
before joining the society.

In all festivals references to these traditions are very frequent, and it
is quite necessary to be acquainted with them in order to understand
the proceedings and speeches, as will appear in the further progress of
this description.

Summing up the preceding considerations, we may say that the
Kwakiutl consisted in olden times of a series of village communities
among which descent was counted in the paternal line, and the mem-
bers of each community were considered descendants of one ancestor.
These communities combined in groups, but the composing elements of
the groups kept a certain degree of independence and continued to be
considered as relatives. Each clan, as we may call the composing ele-
ments of the tribe, developed a clan tradition, which was founded upon
the acquisition of a manitou by the mythical ancestor, the manitou

becoming hereditary in the clan. Owing
to the influence of the northern tribes,
this manitou became attenuated to a
crest, which, in consequence of the
same influence, no Jonger descends in the
male line, but may be given in mar-
riage, so that it descends upon thedaugh-
ter’s children.

So far we have
considered the
clan as a unit.
The individu.
als composing
the clan do not
form, however,
a homogeneous
mass, but differ
in rank. Atl]
the tribes of the Pacific Coast are divid-
ed into a nobility, common people, and
slaves. The last of these may be left
out of consideration, as they do not
form part and parcel of the clan, but
are captives made in war, or purchases,
and may change ownership as any
other piece of property. The clan of the
Kwakiutl is so organized that a certain
limited number of families are recog-
nized. The ancestor of each of these
families has a tradition of his own aside
from the general clan tradition, and,
owing to the possession of the tradi-
tion, which almost always concerns the
acquisition of a manitou, he has certain
crests and privileges of his own. This
tradition and the crests and privileges
connected with it descended, together
with the name of the ancestor, upon his
direct descendants in the male line, or,
as indicated above, through marriage
of his daughter, upon his son-in-law,
and through him upon his grandehil-
dren. But there is only one man at a

the tribe. The number of noblemen is therefore fixed. They are not
equal in rank, but range in the manner in which their ancestors were
supposed to range. At all festivals they sit in the order of their rank,
which is therefore called the ‘* seat” of the person (7a’qoe). The legend
says that the order of seats was given by the deity at a festival of the
tribes, at the time when animals were still able to speak. The noblest
clan, and among them the noblest name, is called the “ eagle” (kue/k")
of the tribe. In order to show the complexity of this system, I givea

Ill. THE POTLATCH.

Before proceeding any further it will be necessary to describe the
method of acquiring rank. This is done by means of the potlatch, or
the distribution of property. This custom has been described often,
but it has been thoroughly misunderstood by most observers. The
underlying principle is that of the interest-bearing investment of
property.

The child when born is given the name of the place where it is born.
This name (g-i/nLaxLe) it keeps until about a year old. Then his father,
mother, or some other relative, gives a paddle or a mat to each member
of the clan and the child receives his second name (na/map’axLéya).
When the boy is about 10 or 12 years old, he obtains his third name
(SomiatsExLi’yé). In order to obtain it, he must distribute a number
of small presents, such as shirts or single blankets, among his own
clan or tribe. When the youth thus starts out in life, he is liberally
assisted by his elders, particularly by the nobility of the tribe.

I must say here that the unit of value is the single blanket, now-a-
days a cheap white woolen blanket, which is valued at 50 cents. ‘The
double blanket is valued at three single blankets. These blankets form
the means of exchange of the Indians, and everything is paid for in
blankets or in objects the value of which is measured by blankets.
When a native has to pay debts and has not a sufficient number of
blankets, he borrows them from his friends and has to pay the following
rates of interest:

For a period of a few months, for 5 borrowed blankets 6 must be
returned (Le’k-0); for a period of six months, for 5 borrowed blankets 7
must be returned (ma”’Laxsa Le/k-oyo); for a period of twelve months or
longer, for 5 borrowed blankets 10 must be returned (de‘ida or g’é/La).

When a person has a poor credit, he may pawn his name for a year.
Then the name must not be used during that period, and for 30 blankets
which he has borrowed he must pay 100 in order to redeem his name.
This is called q’a’q’oaxo (selling a slave).

The rate of interest of the Lé/k-6 varies somewhat around 25 per
cent, according to the kindness of the loaner and the credit of the
borrower. For a very short time blankets may be loaned without
interest. This is designated by the same term.

When the boy is about to take his third name, he will borrow
blankets from the other members of the tribe, who all assist him. He
must repay them after a year, or later, with 100 per centinterest. Thus
he may have gathered 100 blankets. In June, the time set for this act,
the boy will distribute these blankets among his own tribe, giving
proportionately to every member of the tribe, but a few more to the
chief. This is called La’/X’uit. When after this time any member of
the tribe distributes blankets, the boy receives treble the amount he
has given. The people make it a point to repay him inside of a month.
342 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Thus he owns 300 blankets, of which, however, he must repay 200 after
the lapse of a year. He loans the blankets out among his friends, and
thus at the close of the year he may possess about 400 blankets.

The next June he pays his debts (qoana’) in a festival, at which all
the clans from whom he borrowed blankets are present. The festival
is generally held on the street or on an open place near the village.
Up to this time he is not allowed to take part in feasts. But now he
may distribute property in order to obtain
a potlatech name (p’a’/tsaxLiiye). This is
also called La/ Nuit.

At this time the father gives up his seat
(La’Xoe) in favor of hisson. After the boy
has paid his debts, the chief calls all the
older members of the tribe to a council, in
which it is resolved that the boyis to re-
ceive his father’s seat. The chief sends
his speaker to call the boy, and his clan go
out in company with the speaker. The
young man—for henceforth he will be
counted among the men—dresses with a
black headband and paints long vertical
stripes, one on each side of his face, run-
ning down from the outer corners of the
eyes. The stripes represent tears. He
gives a number of blankets to his friends,
who carry them into the house where the
council is being held. The speaker enters
first and announces his arrival. The
young man follows, and after him enter
his friends, carrying blankets. He _ re-

Berlin. (No’matseiL). The blankets given away

at this feast are repaid with 100 per cent interest. In this manner the
young man continues to loan and to distribute blankets, and thus is able,
with due circumspection and foresight, to amass a fortune. Sometimes
it happens that the successor to a man’s name (Lawu’Iqame) already has
a name of his own. In all such eases (also when the name is acquired
by inheritance) the successor gives up his name and his property to his
own successor.

Possession of wealth is considered honorable, and it is the endeavor
of each Indian to acquire a fortune. But it is not as much the posses-

sion of wealth as the ability to give great festivals which makes wealth
a desirable object to the Indian. As the boy acquires his second
name and man’s estate by means of a distribution of property, which
in course of time will revert to him with interest, the man’s name
acquires greater weight in the councils of the tribe and greater renown
among the whole people, as he is able to distribute more and more
property at each subsequent festival. Therefore boys and men are
vying with each other in the arrangement of great distributions of
property. Boys of different clans are pitted against each other by
their elders, and each is exhorted to do his utmost to outdo his rival.
And as the boys strive against each other,
so do the chiefs and the whole clans, and
the one object of the Indian is to outdo
his rival. Formerly feats of bravery
counted as well as distributions of prop-
erty, but nowadays, as the Indians say,
‘rivals fight with property only.” The
clans are thus perpetually pitted against
‘each other according to their rank. The

something (for instance, a basket). This ok Sai
means that by the amount of property given the name of the rival is
flattened.

There is still another method of rising in the social scale, namely, by
showing one’s self superior to the rival. This may be done by inviting
the rival and his clan or tribe to a festival and giving him a consider-
able number of blankets. He is compelled to accept these, but is not
allowed to do so until after he has placed an equal number of blankets
on top of the pile offered to him. This is called dapEntg:ala and the
blankets placed on top of the first pile are called da/pEno. Then he
receives the whole pile and becomes debtor to that amount, i. e., he
must repay the gift with 100 per cent interest.
344 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

A similar proceeding takes place when a canoe is given to a rival.
The latter, when the gift is offered to him, must put blankets to the
amount of half the value of the canoe on to it. This is called da/g-6t,
taking hold of the bow of the canoe. These blankets are kept by the
first owner of the canoe. Later on, the recipient of the canoe must
return another canoe, together with an adequate number of blankets, as
an ‘“‘anchor line” for the canoe. This giving of a canoe is called sa/k-a.

Still more complicated is the purchase or the gift, however one
chooses to term it, of a “‘copper.” All along the North Pacific Coast,
from Yakutat to Comox, curiously shaped copper plates are in use,
which in olden times were made of native copper, which is found in
Alaska and probably also on Nass River, but which nowadays are
worked out of imported copper. The typical shape of these copper
plates may be seen in figs. 2 and 3 and Plate 4. The T-shaped part
(qa’la’s), which forms two ridges, is hammered. The top is called ‘the
face” (0/nuXLEMe), the lower part the hind end (0‘nutsExste). The
front of the copper is covered with black lead, in which a face, repre-
senting the crest animal of the owner, is graven. These coppers have
the same function which bank notes of high denominations have with
us. The actual value of the piece of copper is small, but it is made to
represent a large number of blankets and can always be sold for
blankets. The value is not arbitrarily set, but depends upon the
amount of property given away in the festival at which the copper is
sold. On the whole, the oftener a copper is sold the higher its value,
as every new buyer tries to invest more blankets init. Therefore the
purchase of a copper also brings distinction, because it proves that the
buyer is able to bring together a vast amount of property.

Each copper has a name of its own, and from the following list of
coppers, which were in Fort Rupert in 1893, the values attached to some
of them may be seen:

Ma’xts’olem (— all other coppers are ashamed to look at it), 7,500 blankets.!

L’a/xolamas (= steel-head salmon, i. e., it glides ont of one’s hands like a salmon),
6,000 blankets.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 345

The purchase of a high-priced copper is an elaborate ceremony, which
must be described in detail. The trade is discussed and arranged long
beforehand. When the buyer is ready, he gives to the owner of the
copper blankets about one-sixth of the total value of the copper. This
is called “‘making a pillow” for the copper (qé/nuliLa); or ‘*making
a feather bed” (ta/lqoa) or ‘* the harpoon line at which game is hang-
ing” (do‘xsEmt), meaning that in the same manner the copper is
attached to the long line of blankets; or ‘‘ taken in the hand, in order
to lift the copper” (da’g:ilélEm). The owner of the copper loans these
blankets out, and when he has called them in again, he repays the total
amount received, with 100 per cent interest, to the purchaser. On the
following day the tribes assemble for the sale of the copper. The pre-
scribed proceeding is as follows: The buyer offers first the lowest
prices at which the copper was sold. The owner declares that he is
satisfied, but his friends demand by degrees higher and higher prices,
according to all the previous sales of the copper. This is called g-i/na.
Finally, the amount offered is deemed satisfactory. Then the owner
asks for boxes to carry away the blankets. These are counted five
pairs a box, and are also paid in blankets or other objects. After
these have been paid, the owner of the copper calls his friends—mem-
bers of his own tribe—to rise, and asks for a belt, which he values at
several hundred blankets. While these are being brought, he and his
tribe generally repair to their house, where they paint their faces and
dress in new blankets. When they have finished, drums are beaten in
the house, they all shout “hi!” and go out again, the speaker of the seller
first. As soon as the latter has left the house, he turns and calls his
chief to come down, who goes back to where the sale is going on, fol-
lowed by his tribe. They all stand in a row and the buyer puts down
the blankets which were demanded as a belt, “to adorn the owner of the
copper.” This whole purchase is called “putting the copper under the
name of the buyer” (La‘sa).

In this proceeding the blankets are placed in piles of moderate
height, one pile close to the other, so that they occupy a considerable
amount of space. In Fort Rupert there are two high posts on the
beach bearing carved figures on top, between which the blankets are
thus piled (Plate 5). They stand about 40 steps apart.

On the following day all the blankets which have been paid for the
copper must be distributed by the owner among his own tribe, paying
to them his old debts first, and, if the amount is sufficient, giving new
presents. This is called ‘“‘doing a great thing” (wa’lasila).

Coppers are always sold to rivals, and often a man will offer his cop-
per for sale to the rival tribe. If it is not accepted, it is an acknowl-
edgment that nobody in the tribe has money enough to buy it, and
the name of the tribe or clan would consequently lose in weight.
Therefore, if a man is willing to accept the offer, all the members of
the tribe must assist him in this undertaking with loans of blankets.
346 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Debts which are repaid in the wa/lasila were mostly contracted in this
manner.

In order to better illustrate this curious proceeding, I will describe
the sale of a copper which took place in the winter of 1894-95.

First, a feast was celebrated, in which the Ma/maléleqala offered the
copper Ma/xts’oleEm for sale to the Kwakiutl. Ma’Xua, chief of the
clan Maa/mtag-ila, invited all the tribes to his house. Then he spoke:

“Come, tribe, to my house. This is the house of the first Ma’Xua
at G-agaxsdals.

“This is the feast house of Ma’Xua here.

“This is the house to which Ma/Xua invited at Eg-isbalis.

“This is the house to which Ma/Xua invited at Qalo’gwis.

“This is the feast house of Ma’Xua at G:a/qis.

“This is the house to which my father invited at Tsa/xis.

‘“‘T take the place of my father now. .

‘‘T invited you, tribes, that you should come and see my house here.

‘“‘T am proud to speak of my ancestor, the chief who in the beginning
of the world had the name Ma/Xua.”

Then Ma/Xua turned to his own tribe and said: “ Yes, K’esoyag:ilis.
Yes, Ma’/Xuag-ila. Let me speak of my ways, Wa, wa! thus I speak,
my tribe.” Then he turned again to the other tribes and told them
to sing, saying, ‘‘Go on, tell the whole world, tribes! go on and sing;
this was given to our ancestors in the beginning of the world by
Kuekuaxa’oé.!”

Now Ma/Xua stopped speaking, and Qoay0o/Llas, chief of the Ma’mal-
éleqala of the clan Wa‘las, spoke: ‘‘ Yes, Chief! it is true what you said.
I thank you for your words, Chief! Our ways are not new ways. They
were made by our chief (the deity) and marked out for us when he made
our ancestors men. We try to imitate what our ancestors were told to
do by the creator. Keep in your old ways, Kwakiutl; keep in the ways
of your grandfathers, who laid down the custom for you.” Then
he turned to his own tribe and said: “That is what I say, Wa/k:as.
That is what I say, NEg-e’. The word of the chief shall not hurt
me.” Now he took the copper (Plate 6) and said: ‘‘ Now sing my
song!” His tribe sang, and after they had finished Qoayo’Llas spoke
again: ‘Yes, my tribe! I can not help how I feel; I have nothing
against the way, Kwakiutl, in which you treat me and my tribe. Now
I will promise blankets to you, Kwakiutl, blankets to you, Gué’tEla,
blankets to you, Q’o’moyue, blankets to you, Q’o’mk-utis, blankets to
you, Walas Kwakiutl; this copper belongs to Ts’a’/xts’agits’Emqa, the
son of Walas NEm0/gwis. Now take care, great tribe! This great
copper has a high price; its name is Ma/xts’olem (the one of whom all
are ashamed). Now I am going to lay it down before you, Kwakiutl.
Do not let me carry it myself, La/bid! Take it to the chiefs.”

Then La’bid arose and spoke: “Say this again, my chief! Now look
out, chiefs of the Kwakiutl, this is Sé/xitg-ila Ma/xts’dlmm,' This I will
bring to you.”

Then he stepped toward the Kwakiutl, and put the copper on the floor
where they were sitting. Now Owaxa’lag-ilis arose, took the copper, and
spoke: “Thank you, Walas NEm0/gwis. Come now, salmon, for which
our forefathers have been watching. This is Ma/xts’olmm. I will buy
this Ma/xts’olEm. Now pay me, Kwakiutl, what I loaned to you, that
I may buy it quickly, in order to keep our name as high as it is now.
Don’t let us be afraid of the price of Ma/xts’olkm, my tribe, wa, wa!
Now put down the dishes, that our tribe may eat.”

Owaxa‘lag‘ilis sat down, the young man distributed the dishes, and
all the tribes ate. Now Ma/Xua stepped up again and spoke kindly to
the eating people. “Go on,” he said, “eat, Walas NEm0/gwis; eat,
He’Lamas; eat, NEg-e’; eat you, Ma’maléleqala; eat, La/qoLas; eat,
G’oté, you NE/nqic; eat, Sé’wit’é; eat, E’/wanuX; eat you, Lau’itsis;
eat, Wa’/k-as; eat, Po’tLidé, you, Ma’t’ilpé; eat, Wats’e; eat, He’ was, you
TEna/xtax. Eat,all you tribes. Now itis done. I have already told
you of my grandfather. This food here is the good will of our fore-
father. It is all given away. Now, look out, Kwakiutl! our chief
here is going to buy this copper, and let us help him, wa, wa!” Then
spoke Ha/mEsk-inis and said: ‘* Your words are true, Chief! how true are
your words. I know how to buy coppers; I always pay high prices for
coppers. Now take care, Kwakiutl, my tribe, else you will be laughed
at. Thus I say, O’ts’éstalis; thus I say, Wa/nuk"; thus I say, young
chiefs of the Kwakiutl; thus I say, Tso/palis; thus I say, O’gwila; thus
I say, O/mx“it, young chiefs of the Q’0/moyué; thus I say, Qoée/milasty’é ;
thus Isay, Yéqawit, chiefs of the Q’o’mk-utis; thus I say, Qoayo/Llas;
thus I say, Wa‘kidis, young chiefs of the Walas Kwakiutl. This is
my speech for our children, Ma’/Xuag-ila, that they may take care,
wa, wa!” Then Qoayo’Llas stood up again and said: “Thank you;
did you hear, Labid? Ho, ho, ho, ho, uo, u6, uo. [The ‘‘ho” means the
lifting of the heavy copper from the ground; the “uo” is the cry of the
Ts’0/noqoa.|? Now let me invite them, Ma/maleéleqala; I believe they
want to buy my copper. Now I will invitethem.” Then his tribe said:
‘“‘Do it, do it,” and he continued: ‘“ Now, Gue’tEla, behold the dance of

see the dance of AomoLa, the daughter of Walas NEm0/gwis. Now,

NEm0’/gwis. Now, Walas Kwa‘kiutl, see the dance of Ma/Xualag‘ilis,
the son of Walas NEm0’gwis. ‘These are my words, wa, wa!”

Then all the guests went out. Later on Owaxa/lagvilis invited all
the Kwakiutl, Ma/maléleqala, N&/mqic, Lau/itsis, T’Ena/xtax, and
Ma’tilpé, because he intended to buy the copper Ma/xts’olem that

morning on the beach. Then all the tribes assembled. Owaxa‘lagvilis
stood on the beach and spoke. He said:

“Now, come, chiefs of all the tribes. Yes, you come, because we
want to do a great work. Now, I am going to buy the copper
Ma’xts’olem, of Walas NEmo/gwis. Only don’t ask too high a price
for it. And you, young chiefs of the Kwakiutl, take care and help me.
Go now and bring the blankets from my house.”

Then the young men went and piled up the blankets on the beach.
Ma/Xua and O’ts’estalis counted them. One man of the Ma/maleleqala,
one of the Nimkish, one of the Lau‘itsis, kept the tally.’

Ma/Xua spoke: “It is my office to take care of the property of our
chief. It was the oftice of my forefathers. Now I will begin.” Then
he counted one pair, two pairs, three pairs, four pairs, five pairs, six pairs,
seven pairs, eight pairs, nine pairs, ten pairs. As soon as ten pairs
were counted, he said aloud, “ten pairs,” and the counters repeated,
“twenty blankets,” and put two stones aside. When Ma/Xua had
counted another ten pairs, the counters said, ‘forty blankets,” and put
two more stones aside. They continued to put aside two stones for
each ten pairs of blankets (Plates 7 and 8). Twomen. kept on piling up
the blankets, and when they had piled up 1,000 blankets, Ma/Xua said
aloud, ‘One thousand blankets.” The blankets were piled up along-
side of a carved beam standing on the beach (Plate 5). When the pile
was high enough, a new one was begun right next to the first pile.

Then Owaxa/lag‘ilis arose and spoke: “Tribes, I buy the copper
Ma’xts’olEm with these 1,000 blankets. I shall not give any more
unless the chiefs of all the tribes should ask for more, wa! That is
my speech, chiefs of the Kwakiutl.” Now he sat down and Walas
NeEm0/egwis arose. He said: “Ya, Owaxa/lag-ilis! are your words true?
Did you say it was enough?” Then he turned to his tribe and said,
“Ya, Olsi’wit! Now rise. chief, and speak for me. That is what I say,
La’‘bide.”

Then Olsi/wit arose (see Plates 9 and 10) and said: “Are those your
words, Kwakiutl? Did you say this was all that you were going to give
for the copper? Ave there 1,000 blankets?” The counters replied, “ Yes,
there are 1,000 blankets.” Olsi/wit continued: ‘Thank you, Owaxa’-
lag ilis, Chief. Do you think you have finished? Now take care,
Kwakiutl! You, Chief, give twenty times ten pairs more, so that there
will be 200 more.” Then he turned to his tribe and said, ‘Chiefs of the
Ma’maleleqala! Now, i have said my words, Chief Walas NEm0/gwis.”

Then Owaxa/lag‘ilis arose and said: “ Your speech, Olsi/wit, is good.
It pleases my heart.” And he said to the young men: “Go and bring
200 blankets from my house.” They went at once and brought those
blankets.

Then Ma’Xua arose and counted the blankets. He ealled out how

‘Every tribe has « man to count blankets. This office is not hereditary. When
coppers are traded, the song makers count blankets.

many there were. He said: “There are 1,200 blankets in a pile here,
chiefs of all the tribes, wa, wa!”

Now Olsi/wit arose and said: “Thank you, Kwakiut!. Verily, I got
all I asked for in my speech and we Ma/maléleqala are pleased,
wa, wa!”

Again Walas NEm0/gwis arose and spoke: “Thank you, Owaxa/-
lag-ilis, thank you, Chief. It will not be my desire if all the chiefs of
my tribe ask for more blankets. I am satisfied.” Now he turned to
his tribe and said: ‘“ Now we must speak, my tribe. Arise, G-é/g-msLmEn.
Speak, Chief! Speak more strongly.”

Then G-:é@’g-ESLEn arose and said: “ How nice it is, tribes! I thank
you for your words, Owaxa‘lag-ilis. Yes, Chiefs, that is our way, to
which you must conform. You were not provident when you resolved
to buy this great copper. My heart is well inclined toward you, Chief!
You have not finished; you will give more. The price of the copper
must correspond to my greatness, and I ask forty times ten blankets,
that is 400 blankets more, Chief. That is what I mean, forty. Wa,
Chief. I shall not speak again if I get what I ask from you.” Then he
turned to his own tribe. “Chief Walas Nem0o/ewis, I have done what
you asked of me. Youasked me to speak strongly to that chief, wa, wa!”

Then Owaxa/lag:ilis arose and spoke. He said: “ Yes, Chief, your
speech was good. You have no pity. Have you finished now asking
for more, if I am willing to give your chief 400 blankets more?) Answer
menow!” Now G-é’g:ESLEn spoke: “I shall not try to speak again.”
Owaxa‘lag-ilis sent two young men. They brought the blankets and
put them down. Again Ma/Xua took the blankets and spoke:

‘Ya, tribes! Do you see now our way of buying? The Kwakiutl, my
tribe, are strong when they buy coppers. They are not like you. You
always bring the canoes and the button blankets right away. Now
there are 1,600 blankets in this pile that I carry here.” He turned to
the Kwakiutl and said: “That is what I say, Chiefs of the Kwakiutl,
to those who do not know how to buy coppers. Now I begin again.” He
counted the blankets and went on in the same way as before. As soon
as ten pairs of blankets were counted, they said aloud, ‘ten pairs,” and
the counters said aloud how many tens of blankets had been counted.
When he had counted all, Ma’/Xua spoke: “‘Wa, wa! Now I say to
you, chiefs of all the tribes, it is really enough! I have pity upon my
chief. That is what I say, chiefs.”

Then Owaxa‘lag-ilis arose and spoke: ‘‘Wa,wa! I say it is enough,
Ma/‘maléleqala. Now you have seen my name. This is my name; this
is the weight of my name. This mountain of blankets rises through
our heaven. My name is the name of the Kwakiutl, and you can not do
as we do, tribes. When you do it, you finish just as soon as you reach
the 1,000 blankets. Now, look out! later on I shall ask you to buy
from me. Tribes! I do not look ahead to the time when you will buy
from me. My chiefs! that is what I say, O’ts’éstalis; that is what 1
350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

say, Wa’kidis; that is what I say, Ma/Xualagvilis; that is what I say,
Ma/Xuayalisame. That is what I say for all of you from whom cop-
pers may be bought, by the chiefs of these our rivals, the Ma/maleéleq ala,
Wa, wa!”

Then Walas NEm0/egwis arose and spoke: ‘“ Yes, Chief, your speech
is true, your word is true. Who is like you, Kwakiutl, who buy coppers
and who give away blankets. Long life to all of you, chiefs of the
Kwakiutl. I can not attain to your high name, great tribes.” Then he
turned to his tribe and said: ‘That is what I said, chiefs of the
Ma/maleleqala, that we may beat these Kwakiutl. They are like a
large mountain with a steep precipice. Now arise, Ya/qaLEnlis, and
speak, Chief! Let me see you that I may look up to you, Chief! Now
call your name, T's’0/noqoa, you, Chief, who knows how to buy that great
copper. You can not be equaled by anybody. You great mountain
from which wealth is rolling down, wa, wa! That is what I say, my
tribe!”

Then Ya/qaLEnlis arose and uttered the cry of Ts’0/ndqoa: “ho, ho,
ho, ho!” and he acted as though he was lifting the heavy weight of the
copper from the ground. “You all know, Kwakiutl, who I am. My
name is Ya/qaLEnlis. The name began at the time when our world was
made. Iamadescendant of the chiefs about whom we hear in the ear-
liest legends. The Ho’X hog camedown to X0’xop’a, and took off his bird
mask and became aman. Then he took the name Ya/qaLEnlis. That
was my ancestor, the first of the Qoe’xsot’énox. He married La/qoag:i-
layuqoa, the daughter of Walas NEm0’egwis, the first chief of the great
clan WéewamasqEm of the Ma/maleleqala. That is the reason why L
speak. I know how to buy great coppers. I bought this copper
Ma’‘xts’olem for 4,000 blankets. What is it, Chief? What is it, Owa-
xa/lag:ilis? Come! did you not give any thought to my copper here?
You always say that you are rich, Chief. Now give more, that it may
be as greatas Iam. Give only ten times 100 blankets more, Chief Owa-
xa'lagilis. It will not be much, give 1,000 more for my sake, wa, wa.
This is what I say, Ha’wasalaL; that is what I say, Hé’/Xuayus; that
is what I say, Wawilapalaso; that is what I say for all of you, chiefs
of the Ma’maleéleqala, Wa, wa!”

Then Owaxa/lag-ilis arose and spoke: ‘Yes, yes, you are feared by
all, Great Chief! Do not show mercy in your speech. Now I am going
to ask all of you, chiefs of the Ma’maléleqala, will you stop talking if I
give you these 1,000 blankets in addition to the 1,600 blankets on this
pile? If you say it is not enough after I have added the 1,000 blankets,
then I will not force the purchase of the copper.

‘‘Now answer me, Walas NEmo/gwis. I have seen no one giving
1,000 blankets more. I should tell a lie if I should say I had ever seen
it done, as you demand, wa! That is what I say, chiefs of all the
Kwakiutl.”

Now Walas NEmo/gwis arose and spoke: “Chiefs, it is not my desire;
it is the desire of all those chiefs who asked for more; I have enough.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. oo

Bring now the 1,000 blankets for which Chief Ya/qaLeEnlis asked, wa,
wa! That is what I say, Ma/maleleqala, wa!”

Now Owaxa’lag-ilis sent the young men to bring these 1,000 blankets.
They brought them and Ma‘’Xua arose. He counted the blankets and
called out every ten pairs. Then he made a speech: “Ya! tribes,
have all the blankets here been counted?” The people*replied, ‘“ Yes,
yes. Do not maintain, Chief, that we lost run of the number of blan-
kets.” Then Ma’Xua continued: ‘‘ There are 2,600 blankets. I ama
Maa/mtag-ila, whose strength appears when they buy coppers. Take
care, Chief Owaxa‘lagvilis, else we shall be laughed at. Do not give in!
Do not weaken, else you will not get that copper.”

Then Owaxa’lag:ilis arose and spoke: ‘ Your words are good, Ma/Xua:
It is good that you strengthen my heart. Now speak, Walas Nemo’-
gwis! Speak, Chief, and tell me your wishes, else [ shall be too much
troubled. Now say your price and I will take it. That is what I say,
Wa’kidis; that is what I say, Tsopa’lis, wa, wa!”

Owaxa‘lag-ilis sat down, and the tribes were silent. Nobody spoke,
and Walas NEmo’gwis lay down on his back, covering his face with
his blanket. For a long time nobody among all the men spoke. Then
Yeqok’ua‘lag‘ilis, the younger brother of Walas NEm0/’gwis, arose and
said: “Chiefs of the Kwakiutl, | know what makes my brother here
sad. Try, chiefs, that your speech may please the heart of my chief
here. That is what I say, chiefs of the Ma/maléleqala, Wa, wa!”

Then Ha‘mts’it arose and spoke: ‘“‘Kwakiutl, I am afraid of the way
in which my chief here is acting. He is making us asleep and all the
tribes are asleep. That is always the way of the great chief. Now,
Owaxalag“ilis, try to please him!”

Then Owaxa/lagvilis arose and said: ‘“‘Ha/mts’it! you said enough.
Too many are your words. Let only him speak who knows how to buy
that copper, Walas NEmo’gwis! Do not let these children speak. That
is what I say, Kwakiutl, Wa, wa! Now look about in my house, if you
find something to please the heart of this chief. Go! young men.”
They went, and soon they came back carrying blankets, which they
put down. Owaxa/lagilis arose at once and asked the young men
how many blankets they had brought. They replied: ‘Six hundred
blankets.” He continued: ‘Is it true what you said? Now, chiefs of
the Kwakiutl, [ thank you for your words. Ma/Xua! Chief! count
them!” Ma/Xua arose and counted the blankets. Then hesaid: “Ya!
tribes, have you counted these blankets, also? There are now 3,200.
Look out! chiefs of the tribes! for I shall ask you to buy our coppers
also! That is what I say, NEg’é’; that is what I say, K’/wanuXts’,
wa, wa! that is what I say, chiefs of the Kwakiutl, wa, wa!”

Now Walas NEm0/gwis arose and said: ‘Now take care, Ma/male-
leqala! Now, I take that price for our copper. Now give the boxes
into which we may put the blankets. We need 50 boxes, and each
will be worth 5 pairs of blankets.”

Then Owaxa/lag:ilis arose and spoke: “Thank you, Walas NEm0’gwis,
352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

for your speech. You say you take the price. Now go, chiefs of the
Kwakiutl, and bring the boxes! They will be 500 blankets’ worth, to
be paid in canoes.” Then the young men went and brought short split
sticks. They brought 5 sticks. Ma/Xua took them and spoke: “Ya!
tribes! truly, you do not think that your words are hard against Owa-
xa/lagilis? Truly, you get easily what you ask for, chiefs of the Ma’ma-
leleqala. This canoe counts for a box worth 150 blankets. This canoe
counts for a box worth 150 blankets. This canoe counts for a box worth
100 blankets. This canoe counts for a box worth 60 blankets. This
canoe counts for a box worth 40 blankets, wa, wa! Enough, chiefs of
the Ma/malélegala. Now take pity on our chief here. That is what I
say, Kwakiutl.” Then Owaxa/lag-ilis arose and spoke: “Ya, son Walas
NEm0/ewis, I think your heart is pleased. Now there are 3,700 blan-
kets. There are 700 of the fourth thousand. Come, Walas NEm0’ewis,
and you, chiefs, arise, that I may adorn you.” Then Walas NEm0/gwis
arose and spoke: “Come, Ma/Xmawisaqamayé! Come, La‘bid! Comme,
Kwa’‘xilanodkumeée! Come, NEm0‘/kwagvilis! Come, Ha’wasalaL! Come,
Xua/x'sistala! Come, Olsiwit! Come, G:e/g-EsLEn! Come, Ya/qaLEnlis!
Come, Wa’k-asts’e! Come, Ha’misalaL! Come, Ts’0’xts’ais! Let him
who brought our copper look at us! Come, chiefs of the Ma/maléleqala.”
Then all the thirteen chiefs stood in a row, and Walas NEm0/ewis spoke:
“This, Kwakiutl, is the strength of the Ma/maléleqala. These whom you
see here are yourrivals. These are the ones who have the great coppers
which have names, and therefore it is hard work for you to rival them.
Look out! chiefs of the Ma/maléleqala! in case they should bring us the
copper Ma/xts’olem, which we now sold, that one of you may takeit up
at once, or else we must be ashamed. That is what I say, chiefs of the
Ma/maléleqala, Wa, wa! Now go on! Chief Owaxa/lag-ilis!” Then
Owaxdlagilis arose and spoke: ‘Yes, Walas Nemo/gwis, and you
other good chiefs who are standing over there. Now, chiefs of the
Kwakiutl, scurry about in my house for something with which I may
adorn the chiefs.” Then the young men went. Soon they came back,
earrying 200 blankets and two split sticks, on which five straight lines
were marked with charcoal.

Then Ma/Xua arose, took the split sticks, and said: “Thank you,
chiefs of the Ma/maléleqala, for the way in which you act. It must be
true that you are pleased with the way of our chief here. Now listen,
chiefs! Adorn yourselves with this canoe, which is worth 50 blankets,
and with this canoe, which is also worth 50 blankets, and with these
200 blankets here. Now there are 4,000 blankets in all, Wa, wa! Let
me say, it is done!”

Immediately Walas NEm0o’gwis made a speech, and said: “I take
this price, tribes! Thank you, Chief Owaxa’lag-ilis; thank you, Chief;
thank you, Kwakiutl.”

Now Owaxa/lag‘ilis arose and spoke: “Ya, Walas NEm0’gwis. Have
you taken the price, Chief?” Walas NEmo’gwis replied: ‘I have taken
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 353

the price.” “Why, Walas NEm0’gwis,” said Owaxa/lag-ilis, ‘you take
the price too soon; you must think poorly of me, Chief! I am a
Kwakiutl; I am one of those from whom all your tribes all over the
world. took their names. Now you give up before I finished trading
with you, Ma’maléleqala. You must always stand beneath us, wa, wa!
Now go, young men; call our chief here, that he may come and see the
tribes. Bring La/qoagilak".”. Then the young men went, and soon
they returned. The sister of Owaxa‘lag:ilis followed them, carrying
200 blankets. Owaxa’lag-ilis spoke: “Ya, tribes, come here! This is
La/qoag:ilak". That name comes from the oldest legends. Now, take
her clothes and you, Ma’ Xua, give them away!” Now Ma‘Xua counted
the blankets. There were 200 blankets of the fifth thousand. There
were 4,200. ‘‘Wa, wa! Chiefs of the Ma/maléleqala,” said he. Then
Walas NEm0o’gwis spoke: ‘“‘Thank you, chiefs! Now, Ma’maléleqala,
we will divide the property to-morrow, wa, wa!”

It was described above how a boy is introduced into the distributions
of property going on among the tribe. It remains to state how he
acquires his first copper. When the young man has acquired a certain
number of blankets, one of his older friends invites him to take a share
in the purchase of one of the cheaper coppers, which may have a value
of, say, 500 blankets. The boy contributes 200 blankets as his share
and the other man purchases it, announcing the young man as his part-
ner in the transaction. The copper is delivered to the young man, who
becomes a debtor to his partner for the amount of blankets contributed
by the latter. He announces at once that he will sell the copper the
following year, but that he is willing to deliver the copper on the spot.
With these words he lays it down before the tribe. One of the chiefs
of a rival tribe takes the copper and pays as a first installment 100
blankets. Then the boy promises a distribution of blankets (tso/Xua)
for the following year and loans out the 100 blankets which he has
received. Thenext year he calls in his outstanding debts and invites all
the neighboring tribes to a feast, to which his own tribe contributes food
and fuel. In the course of the festival he pays the chief who took his
copper 200 blankets, being the value of the 100 blankets received the
previous year, together with 100 per cent interest (see p. 341). Then
the purchaser pays the sum of 750 blankets for the copper, including
boxes and belt, as described above. Of this amount 700 are distributed
on the following day in the prescribed fashion among the neighboring
tribes. Now the young man proceeds to loan out his blankets until
within a few years he is able to repay the share of his partner who first
helped him to buy the copper. When the time has come for this trans-
action, his partner pays him double the amount of what he (the partner)
has contributed, and the young man returns to him double of this
amount.

The rivalry between chiefs and clans finds its strongest expression
in the destruction of property. A chief will burn blankets, a canoe, or

NAT MUS 95 23

354 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

break a copper, thus indicating his disregard of the amount of property
destroyed and showing that his mind is stronger, his power greater,
than that of his rival. If the latter is not able to destroy an equal
amount of property without much delay, his name is ‘‘broken.” He is
vanquished by his rival and his influence with his tribe is lost, while
the name of the other chief gains correspondingly in renown.
Feasts may also be counted as destruction of property, because the
food given can not be returned except by giving another feast. The
most expensive sort of feast is the one at
which enormous quantities of fish oil (made
of the oulachon) are consumed and burnt,
the so-called ‘grease feast.” Therefore it
also raises the name of the person who can
afford to give it, and the neglect to speedily
return it entails a severe loss of prestige.
Still more feared is the breaking of a valu-
able copper. A chief may break his copper
and give the broken parts to his rival. If
the latter wants to keep his prestige, he
must break a copper of equal or higher
value, and then return both his own broken
copper and the fragments which he has
received to his rival. The latter may then
pay for the copper which he has thus re-
ceived. The chief to whom the fragments
of the first copper are given may, however,
also break his copper and throw beth into
the sea. The Indians consider that by this
act the attacked rival has shown himself
superior to his aggressor, because the latter
may have expected to receive the broken
copper of his rival in return so that an
actual loss would have been prevented.
See ee In by far the greater number of cases
The order in which the sections are Where coppers are broken the copper is

one part after the other until finally only
the T-shaped ridge remains. This is valued at two-thirds of the total
value of the copper and is the last part to be given away. The order in
which the parts of the copper are usually broken off is shown in the
accompanying illustration (fig. 4). The rival to whom the piece that
has been broken off is given, breaks off a similar piece, and returns both
to the owner. Thus a copper may be broken up in contests with
different rivals. Finally. somebody succeeds in buying up all the
broken fragments, which are riveted together, and the copper has
attained an increased value. Since the broken copper indicates the
fact that the owner has destroyed property, the Indians pride them-
selves upon their possession (see Plates 11 and 12).

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 355

The rivalry between chiefs, when carried so far that coppers are
destroyed and that grease feasts are given in order to destroy the
prestige of the rival, often develop into open enmity. When a person
gives a grease feast, a great fire is lighted in the center of the house.
The flames leap up to the roof and the guests are almost scorched by
the heat. Still the etiquette demands that they do not stir, else the
host’s fire has conquered them. Even when the roof begins to burn
and the fire attacks the rafters, they must appear unconcerned. The
host alone has the right to send a man up to the roof to put out the fire.
While the feast is in progress the host sings a scathing song ridiculing
his rival and praising his own clan, the feats of his forefathers and his
own. Then the grease is filled in large spoons and passed to the rival
chief first. Ifa person thinks he has given a greater grease feast than
that offered by the host, he refuses the spoon. Then he runs out of
the house (g-e/qEmx’it=chief rises against his face) to fetch his copper
“to squelch with it the fire.” The host proceeds at once to tie a cop-
per to each of his house posts. If he-should not do so, the person who
Jefused the spoon would on returning strike the posts with the copper,
which is considered equal to striking the chief’s face (k-i/lxa). Then
the man who went to fetch his copper breaks it and gives it to the host.
This is called ‘‘squelching the host’s fire.” The host retaliates as
described above.

The following songs show the manner in which rivals scathe each
other.

First NEqa/pEnk-Em (=ten fathom face) let his clan sing the follow-
ing song at a feast which he gave: !

1. Our great famous chief is known even outside of our world, oh! he is the
highest chief of all. [Then he sang:] The chiefs of all the tribes are my servants,
the chiefs of all the tribes are my speakers. They are pieces of copper which I have
broken.

[The people:] Do not let our chief rise too high. Do not let him destroy too
much property, else we shall be made like broken pieces of copper by the great
breaker of coppers, the great splitter of coppers, the great chief who throws cop-
pers into the water, the great one who can not be surpassed by anybody, the one
surmounting all the chiefs. Long ago you went and burnt all the tribes to ashes.
You went and defeated the chief of all the tribes; you made his people run away
and look for their relatives whom you had slain. You went and the fame of your
power was heard among the northern tribes. You went and gave blankets to every-
body, chief of all tribes.

2. Do not let us stand in front of him, of whom we are always hearing, even at
the outermost limits of this world. Do not let us steal from our chief, tribes! else
he will become enraged and will tie our hands. He will hang us, the chief of the
tribes.

[Neqa/prnk:Em sings:] Do not mind my greatness. My tribe alone is as great
as four tribes. JI am standing on our fortress; I am standing on top of the chiefs of
the tribes. JI am Copper Face, Great Mountain, Supporter, Obstacle; my tribes are
my servants.

At another feast he let his people sing :?

1. Do not look around, tribes! do not look around, else we might see something
that will hurt us in the great house of this really great chief.

‘See Appendix, page 667, 2See Appendix, page 668.
356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

2. “Do not look around, tribes! do not look around, else we might see something
formidable in the great house of this really great chief. His house has the
Ts’o/noqoa.! Therefore we are benumbed and can not move. The house of our
double chief,? of the really great chief, is taking our lives and our breath.”

3. “Do not make any noise, tribes! do not make any noise, else we shall precipi-
tate a landslide of wealth from our chief, the overhanging mountain.”

4. [Neqa’penk‘Em sings:] ‘‘Tam the one from whom comes down and from whom is
untied the red cedar bark? for the chiefs of the tribes. Do not grumble, tribes! do
not gru.uble in the house of the great double chief, who makes that all are afraid to
die at his hands, over whose body is sprinkled the blood of all those who tried to
eat in the house of the double chief,‘ of the really great chief. Only one thing
enrages me, when people eat slowly and a little only of the food given by the great
double chief.”

While these songs are merely a praise of the deeds of the singer, the
following reply by Hé/nak-alaso, the rival of NEqa/pEnk-Em is bitter to
the extreme. In it the singer ridicules him for not yet having returned
a grease feast.’

1. I thought another one was causing the smoky weather? I am the only one on
earth—the only one in the world who makes thick smoke rise from the beginning *
of the year to the end, for the invited tribes. °

2. What will my rival say again—that ‘spider woman;’ what will he pretend to
do next? The words of that ‘spider woman’ do not go a straight way. Will he not
brag that he is going to give away canoes, that he is going to break coppers, that
he is going to give a grease feast? Such will be the words of the ‘spider woman,’
and therefore your face is dry and moldy, you who are standing in front of the
stomachs of the chiefs.

3. Nothing will satisfy you; but sometimes I treated you so roughly that you
begged for mercy. Do you know what you will be like? You will be like an old
dog, and you will spread your legs before me when I get excited. You did so when I
broke the great coppers ‘Cloud’ and ‘Making Ashamed,’ my great property and the
great coppers, ‘Chief’ and ‘Killer Whale,’ and the one named ‘Point of Island’ and
‘The Feared One’ and ‘Beaver.’ This I throw into your face, you whom I always
tried to vanquish; whom I have maltreated; who does not dare to stand erect when
Iam eating; the chief whom even every weak man tries to vanquish.

4. Now my feast! Go to him, the poor one who wants to be fed from the son of
the chief whose own name is ‘Full of Smoke’ and ‘Greatest Smoke.’ Never mind;
give him plenty to eat, make him drink until he will be qualmish and vomits. My
feast steps over the fire right up to the chief.’

In order to make the effect of the song still stronger, an effigy of the
rival chief is sometimes placed near the fire. He is lean, and is repre-
sented in an attitude as though begging that the fire be not made any
hotter, as it is already scorching him (Plate 13).

Property may not only be destroyed for the purpose of damaging the

prestige of the rival, but also for the sole purpose of gaining distine-
tion. This is done mainly at the time when houses are built, when
totem poles are erected, or when a son has been initiated by the spirit
presiding over the secret society of his clan, to which ceremony refer-
ence has previously been made. It
seems that in olden times slaves were
sometimes killed and buried under
the house posts or under totem posts.
Later on, instead of being killed, they
were given away as presents. When-
ever this was done, the inverted figure
of a man, or an inverted head, was
placed on the pole. In other cases
coppers were buried under the posts,
or given away. This custom still con-
tinues, and in all such cases coppers
are shown on the post, often in such
a way that they are being held or
bitten by the totem
animals(Plate14). At
the time of the initia-
tion of a member of
the clan slaves were
also killed or coppers
were destroyed, as
will be described in
greater detail later on.
The property thus
destroyed is called the
o’mayt, the price paid
for the house, the
post, or for the initi-
ation.

the suecessor to the
naine. In all such cases the latter stands during the festival next to the
host, or, as the Indian terms it, in front of him, and the chief states that
the property is distributed or destroyed for the one “standing in front of
him” (Lawu’Iqamé), which is therefore the term used for the chief’s
eldest son, or, in a more general sense, for the heir presumptive.
358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

At all these festivals masks are occasionally worn which represent
the ancestor of the clan and refer to its legend. I will give one exam-
ple: In the potlatch of the clan K*kwa‘kum of the Q’o’/moyue, a mask
representing one of the forefathers of the present clan (not their first
ancestor), whose name was NOo’lis or Wa/tsé appears,—a double mask,
surmounted by a bear (fig. 5). The bear broke the dam which pre-
vented the property of No/lis going up the river. The outer mask
shows NO/lis in a state of rage vanquishing his rivals; the inner side
shows him kindly disposed, distributing property in a friendly way.
His song is as follows: !

1. A bear is standing at the river of the Wanderer who traveled all over the

worid.

2. Wild is the bear at the river of the Wanderer who traveled all over the world.
3. A dangerous fish is going up the river. It will puta limit to the lives of the

people.
4, Ya! The si/siuL? is going up the river. It will put a limit to the lives of the
people.

5. Great things are going up the river. It is going up the river the copper of the
eldest brother of our tribes.

Another song used in these festivals is as follows:*

. The heat of the chief of the tribes will not have mercy upon the people.
. The great fire of our chief in which stones‘ are glowing will not have mercy
upon the people.

3. You, my rival, will eat what is left over when | dance in ny grease feast, when
I, the chief of the tribes, perform the fire dance.

4. Too great is, what you are doing, our chief. Who equals our chief! He is giv-
ing feasts to the whole world.

5. Certainly he has inherited from his father that he never gives a small feast to

the lower chiefs, the chief of the tribes.

toe

The clan Haa‘naLino have the tradition that their ancestor used the
fabulous double-headed snake for his belt and bow. In their potlatches
the chief of the gens appears, therefore, dancing with a belt of this
description and with a bow carved in the shape of the double-headed
snake. The bow is simply a long carved and painted stick to which a
string running through a number of rings and connecting with the
horns and tongues of the snake is attached. When the string is pulled,
the horns are erected and the tongues pulled out. When the string is
slackened, the horns drop down and the tongues slide back again
(Plate 15).

IV. MARRIAGE.

Marriage among the Kwakiutl must be considered a purchase, which
is conducted on the same principles as the purchase of a copper. But
the object bought is not only the woman, but also the right of member-
ship in her clan for the future children of the couple. I explained

before that many privileges of the clan descend only through marriage
upon the son-in-law of the possessor, who, however, does not use them
himself, but acquires them for the use of his successor. These privi-
leges are, of course, not given as a present to the son-in-law, but he
becomes entitled to them by paying a certain amount of property for
his wife. The wife is- given to him as a first installment of the return
payment. The crest of the clan, its privileges, and a considerable
amount of other property besides, are given later on, when the couple
have children, and the rate of interest is the higher the greater the num-
ber of children. For one child, 200 per cent of interest is paid; for
two or more children, 500 per cent. After this payment the marriage
is annulled, because the wife’s father has redeemed his daughter. If
she continues to stay with her husband, she does so of her own free
will (wule’L, staying in the house for nothing). In order to avoid this
state of affairs, the husband often makes a new payment to his father-
in-law in order to have a claim to his wife.

The law of descent through marriage is so rigid that methods have
developed to prevent the extinction of a name when its bearer has no
daughter. In such a case a man who desires to acquire the use of the
crest and the other privileges connected with the name performs a
sham marriage with the son of the bearer of the name (Xue’sa; New-
ettee dialect: da/xsitsEnt=taking hold of the foot). The ceremony is
performed in the same manner as a real marriage. I case the bearer
of the name has no children at all, a sham marriage with a part of his
body is performed, with his right or left side, a leg or an arm, and the
privileges are conveyed in the same manner as in the case of a real
marriage.

It is not necessary that the crest and privileges should be acquired
for the son of the person who married the girl, but they may be trans-
ferred to his successor, whoever that may happen to be.

As the acquisition of the crest and privileges connected with it
play so important a part in the management of marriages, references
to the clan traditions and dramatic performances of portions of the
myth are of frequent occurrence, as may be seen from the following
descriptions:

I will describe first the marriage of a Ma/maléleqala Chief.

NeEm0‘kulag:ilists’e called all the young men of all the tribes to
come to his house. After a second call all the young men came. Then
he arose and spoke: ‘Thank you, my brothers, for coming to my
house. You know what is in my mind—that I want to marry to-day.
You know that I wanted you to come that I might ask my brothers to
invite all the people. Now dress yourselves; there is the paint and
the eagle down.”

The La’g-us arose and spoke: * Yes, NEmo/kulagilists’é, these are
your words. I and my friends will go now to make war upon the daugh-
ters of all the chiefs all over the world. Now take care, my friends!
360 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

young chiefs of all the tribes; paint yourselves and put down on your
heads.” Then the young men painted themselves and put down on
their heads, and went out to the north end of the village. First they
went into the house of Hii‘masaqa. As soon as they had entered
they all said, “Listen!” and La’g-us spoke: “‘ Hear me, tribes! go and
help to bring my bride into my house.” Here he stopped, and one of
the men living in the house said: ‘‘We will do so.” Now they went
from house to house and spoke in the same way. Then they all went
back into the house of NEmo’kulagilists’e. Then they went at once
to call the tribes, and they all came. Now Walas NEm0/gwis spoke:
‘““Come, chiefs of all the tribes, to hear the words of our chief. We
will make war upon the tribes. Something great is in the door of the
house of our future wife. That is all.” Then Walas NEm0’gwis
counted the blankets and the counters kept tally. When 200 were
counted, he said: “We pay for our wife these 200 blankets here.”
Then he counted 100 blankets more, and said: ‘*With these 100 blan-
kets we will lift her. We must lift a heavy weight for the son of
LaJawigvila.” All the men replied: “True, true are your words, chief.”
Walas NEmo/gwis counted 100 blankets more, and said: ‘These are
intended for calling our wife. Wa, chiefs! there are 400 blankets here,
by means of which we are trying to get the daughter of La‘lawig-ila.”

Then Hé/Lamas arose and spoke: “ Yes, son, your speech is good.
All our tribes heard what you said. Now take care, else a mistake
might be made. Thus I say, chiefs of all the tribes. Now arise,
Ta/qoLas, and you, Ma/Xmawisaqamaé, and you, Ya/qaLEnlis, and you,
Ma‘Xuayalits’é; we want to go to war now. Now ask if it is all
right.” They gave them each a single blanket to wear. Then these
four men arose and went to the house of La/lawig:ila. They sat down
in the doorway, and ‘ya/qoLas spoke: ‘*We come, chief, to ask you
about this marriage. Here are 400 blankets ready for you. Now we
are ready to take our wife. That is all.”

Then spoke La‘lawigrila: “Call my future son-in-law, that he may
come for his wife; but let him stay on the beach. You all shall stay
there; only the blankets shall come into my house.” Then Ya/qaLEnlis
spoke: ‘Thank you, Chief, for your words. Now let us tell our chief.”
Then they went to the house of NEmo’kulag-ilists’e. They went in, and
rra/qoLas told the answer of La/lawig-ila to the chiefs of all the tribes,
saying: ‘He told us to come soon to take our wife.” Then all the
young men took the blankets. They put them on the shoulder of other
young men and all walked out. They put the blankets down on the
beach. Then Hé/Lamas arose and spoke: “All the tribes came; I
came, La‘lawigvila, to take from your arms your daughter to be my
wife. Now count the blankets which we brought.”

Then Walas Nrm0’gwis arose. He took the blankets and spoke:
“Yes, chiefs of all the tribes, I am not ashamed to tell about these
blankets. My grandfather was a rich man. Therefore I am not
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 361

ashamed to speak.” ‘True, true!” said all the men, ‘‘who would gain-
say it, Chief!” Walas Nrmo/gwis counted the blankets. When five
pairs of blankets were counted, he put them on the shoulder of one of
the four men, who carried them into the house of La‘lawig-ila. Thus
they did until 200 blankets were counted and carried into the house.
He said: ‘ With these blankets they are married. Now we will try to
lift our wife from the floor.” He took the blankets and said: ‘* With
these we lift her from the floor.” He counted again five pairs, put
them on the shoulder of one of the young men, who carried them into
the house, until 100 were counted. Then Walas NEm0/gwis said:
‘‘There are 100, as we told you, chiefs! Now we will call our wife.”
He took a blanket and said: ‘* We call her with these,” and counted in
the same manner as before. When 100 blankets had been counted, he
said: ‘There are 100 blankets here.” When the four men had carried
all into the house of La/lawig-ila, he came out and said: ‘“ That is what
IT wished for. All the tribes came to marry my daughter. Let my son-
in-law hear it. He shall come into my house if his heart is strong
enough, wa wa!” As soon as his speech was finished, eight men
brought burning torches of cedarwood. Tour stood on the right-hand
side of the door and four on the left-hand side. They put the burning
ends of the torches close together, just wide enough apart for a man to
pass through.

Now Ma/Xua arose. He was to pass through the fire. He ran up
to it, but as soon as he came near it, he became afraid and turned back.
Now he called NEmo’kulag-ilists’é: “Hear it! his heart must be strong
if he wants to accomplish what I attempted in vain.” Nermokula-
g-ilists’e arose and said: “ Yes, Ma/Xua, your word is true. Now look
out, chiefs! else we shall not get my wife and I shall be ashamed of it.
That is the legend which my father told me, how the daughter of
Nu’nemaskqa was married at oa/Saxsdalis. <A fire was at the door of
her house. Now arise, La/LiliLa, take two pairs of blankets and give
them to him whose heart is strong, else our friends will try in vain to
get my wife.” Then La/LiliLa arose, took the blankets and carried
them to Walas NEmo’gwis, who spoke: “Tribes! Let him whose heart
is strong go up to that house. These two pairs of blankets are for him
who will go there.” Then Ma/Xuag-ila the Koskimo arose and spoke:
“Tam notfrightened. [am LEIpéla. This name comes from the oldest
legend. He knew how to jump into the fire. Now I will go, you beat
the boards!” As soon as the men began to beat the boards he ran up
to the fire, and although the torches were close together, he ran through
them into the house. He was not hurt. When he got into the house,
NeEm0‘kulagvilists’é said: “Ho, ho, ho, ho. He has succeeded! Thank
you, my tribe.” As soon as MaXuag-ila had entered the house the fire
disappeared. La/Lawig-ila came out and spoke: ‘Come now and take
your wife, sonin-law!” They brought out blankets and La/Lawigvila
said: “Now I give youasmall gift, son-in-law. Sell it for food. There
362 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

are 200 blankets.” Then Walas NEm0/gwis arose: ‘‘ Don’t sit down,
tribes. Let ussing a song of joy! Take care, chiefs of the Ma’male-
leyala, we will make fun of the Kwakiutl. My chief has again given
blankets. The name of my tribe is Ma/maléleqala, who vanquish all.
I am feared by all the tribes. i can not be lifted. I know how to buy
ereat coppers. I make chiefs out of poor men. Whenever I give
away blankets, I do so in Tsa/xis on account of the legend of Ma/léle-
qala, who was first transformed into a man at this place.”

Thus spoke Walas NEmo/gwis and all arose and sang:

1. The deer went on the water, and tried to make war on his younger brother.

2, Kuékuaxa’oé gave up the chase, trying to make war on his younger brother.

3. Only I do this way. Only I am the great one who takes away the daughter of

chiefs, the younger brother of Kuckuaxa’oe.

When they stopped singing, NEmo’kulag-ilists’é said, *‘ Ho, ho, ho,
ho,” and he promised to give away blankets. He said: “These are
blankets for you, Guée/tEla; blankets for you, Q’o’moyueé; blankets for
you, Walas Kwakiutl; blankets for you, Q’o’/mk-utis. They belong
to 1a/qoaqa, the daughter of NEmo/kulag“ilists’,” and he said, ‘ Now
go to take my wife and the blankets.”

Then the men went to the house of La‘lawig-ila, and after a short
time they came back. Ts’a’ts’alkoalis, his daughter, was among them.
Then all the men went home. He did not give away the blankets at
once. She went to live with her husband.

Hereis the description of another marriage: The successor of Ma/Xua,
chief of the Gua/ts’éndx, was engaged to marry He/nEdemis, daughter
of Ya/qaLasame, chief of the Qo’sqémuX. Then Ma/Xua sent four
men—Kasa/lis, A’/wite, NeEme’malas, and Ya/side—to ask if Ya’qaLa-
samé agreed to the marriage. As soon as the four men entered his
house, Kasa/lis spoke: ‘I come, chief! sent to you by the son of Ma‘Xua.
He has 400 blankets ready to be given to you to buy in marriage your
daughter, and also to take home your daughter, Ya/qaLasame. We
beg of you, O, Chief! to bend your heart to our wishes, for you have
nothing to complain of. We all are of one descent. Weare sent by
your uncle, chief, and by your great-grandson, the successor to Ma’/Xua.
Thus Lsay, NEme’malas. Now we have said our speech, A/wite, Ya/sidé.
Now, A/wité, you speak to our uncle here.” Then A/wité spoke: “Let
me speak next, Kasa/lis. I came, sent as a messenger by your uncle.
Let us try to get our relative. Now, Ya/sidé, you speak next.” He
said: “I am the double-headed snake.! There is nothing in the world
that I am unable to obtain. Now move your tongue, and give us an
auswer.”

Then Ya/qaLasameée spoke: “You have finished your speeches that
you were to deliver to me, chiefs of the Gua’ts’énéx. Only let your
tribe take care, A’wité. Now you may have my daughter. Come here

1 See page 371.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 363

that I will show my legend—the fire in the house. If you do not run
away from the heat of my fire, you may have my daughter. Now go,
masters !”

Then the four men left the house. They went and reported the
words of Ya/qaLasamé to Ma/Xua, who prayed his tribe not to fear
the fire.

As soon as they had left, Ya/qaLasame carved a large mask repre-
senting the “Sea Bear,” the mouth of which opened, and attached it
to a bearskin which his dancer was to wear. Then he took a basket
and went to the graveyard, where he took seven skulls and other bones,
which he carried home in his basket. Then he opened the mouth of the
bear mask and put the skulls and the other bones into it. Next he
prepared the seats for Ma’Xua and his friends close to the fireplace.
He poured several bottles of grease into a wooden box and built up a
high pyre, on top of which he placed the box containing the grease.

On the following day Ma’Xua ealled his tribe, and all prepared to go
to Ya/qaLasame’s house. When they entered, Ma/Xua said: ‘ Now be
very careful, my tribe! Do not forget how kindly I feel toward all of
you. If ever you ask me to help you, I do not spurn you, but I feel
proud of your kind feeling toward me. Now chiefs! A‘wite, and you,
NEmé’malas, and you, Ya/sidé, do for me as I have done toward you.
T fear he will show his great fire, then let us take care, my tribe! The
first Gua‘ts’6nox were never afraid; they never fled from anything.
Therefore we, our present generation, must not fear anything, wa!”

Then Ya/sidé spoke: ‘Let us stand by our chief, Gua/ts’éndx! Let
us stand by our chief! The name Ma’/Xua comes from the time long
before our grandfathers. Now our generation is living. Take care,
Ma’Xua, and you, my grandson, ya/SaxidalaLe, for the people of our
tribe have seen your kind heart, wa!”

Then they loaded four canoes with the blankets, for it is a long way
from the village of the Gua/ts’én6x to that of the Qo’sqémuX. They
paddled, and when they arrived at the village of the Qod’/sqémuX,
A‘wité arose in the canoe and said: “Now, show yourselves, QO/sqi-
muX! lam of the Gua’ts’éndX tribe and come to get Hée/nEdemis, the
daughter of your chief, Ya/qaLasame, as wife for my grandson, »ja/Saxi-
dalaLe. Now, NEg-é’tsé and A/wité, count the blankets!” Now they
counted the blankets. As soon as there were five pairs of blankets,
A‘wité said: “Ten I am paying for my wife,” and when another five
pairs were counted, he said so again, and so on until all the blankets
were counted. Then Ya/qaLasamé went out of the house and said:
“Come, Gua‘ts’endx, come up from the beach into my house.” Then
they all went ashore and entered Ya/qaLasamé’s house. When all were
in, Goax:i‘lats’é spoke: “Welcome, Gua/ts’én6x! Come, Ma/Xua; come,
Ya/side; come, NEmé@’malas; come, A’wité; come, Ka/salis. Thank you
for coming, Chief L’E/nk-alas. Now take care, Gua/ts’endx, for here is
the Q’o’moqoa, a sea monster, who swallows everything, and there in —
364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the rear of the house is he who devoured everyone who tried to marry
the daughter of Ya/qaLasamé, and this fire has hurt everyone who
tried to marry He/nEdemis. Now, Chief Ya/qaLasamé, light your fire
and let the chief get our daughter here.”

Then Ya/qaLasame lit the fire and all the Gua/ts’énéx sat down
close to it. When the fire was burning, Ya/qaLasamé spoke: ‘ Now
take care, Gua’‘ts’énox, for I intend to try you. You said you were not
afraid of Ts’0/noqoa? Now I will try all of you, chiefs of the Gua/ts’enox.
On account of this fire nobody can get my daughter.”

When the grease began to burn, all the Gua/ts’én6x lay down on their
backs and their blankets were scorched. Now the fire died out, and
then Kasa‘lis spoke: “Ya, QO’/sqemuX! This ismy way. I am afraid
of nothing. Even if you should begin to murder us, I should not run
away. Now, Gua/ts’énox, we have our wife. Here, Chief Ya/qaLa-
samé! Look at our blankets which we are giving you.” Then Ya/qaLa-
samé spoke: ‘Chiefs of the Gua/ts’éndx, I have seen you are really a
savage people, and everyone fears you. I am afraid of you, for you
are the first ones who have not run away from my fire. If you had
run away, you would not have obtained my daughter for your wife.”
Then he shouted: ‘*Take her, Gua‘ts’enédx! Now you. devourer of all
tribes, step forward, that Ma’Xua and xya/saxidalaLeé may see who has
eaten the suitors of my daughter. Now look, NEmé’malas; look,
A/wite; look, Ya/sidé; and you, Kasa/lis, and see the devourer of the
tribes.” Then Ya/qaLasamé took a pole and poked the stomach of the
devourer of the tribes who had come forward. Then the mask vom-
ited the seven skulls and the other bones and Ya/qaLasamé continued:
“Now look at it, Gua/ts’éndox. These are the bones of the suitors
who came to marry my daughter and who ran away from my fire. The
devourer of tribes ate them. That is what he vomited. Now come,
Hé’/nEdemis, and go to your husband!”

Then she came and went into the canoe of the Gua/ts’endox. They
all went into the canoe and returned home.

I will give still another example, namely, the marriage ceremony of
the L’a/sq’enodx, which is founded on the following tradition: A chief of
the L’a/sq’énox speared a sea otter which pulled his canoe out to sea,
He tried to cut the line, but it stuck to the canoe. Finally the moun-
tains of his country went out of sight. After a long time he saw a
black beach, and when he came near, he saw that it was the place where
all the coal of fires goes when it drifts down the northward current of
the sea. He passed this place and came to the place where all the dry
sand is drifting to and fro. The sea otter continued to puli him on, and
he arrived at the place where the down (of birds) is drifting on the
water. He passed those and came to the place where the toilet sticks'
are going. Finally he discovered a village on a beach. The sea otter
jumped ashore and was transformed into a man, who entered the chief’s

1 Cedar splints used in place of toilet paper.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 365

house. The chief’s speaker invited the man to enter, and asked him
what he wanted. The person who sees peoples’ thoughts sat to the
right of the door and said: ‘He comes to get a magical treasure.” Then
the chief of the sea otter, for it was he whose house he had entered,
gave hima harpoon and said: *‘ You will be the chief of the world. Do
you want anything else?” “Yes,” replied the man, “I want to marry
your daughter.” She was sitting on a platform in the rear of the house.
He married her, and the chief gave him four men to show him the way
home. The girl’s names were Tsé@/saqa (sea otter pup woman) and
G-a’laxa-is (first to receive gifts). When they approached the village of
the L’a’sq’enox, Tse’saqa commanded her husband to throw the man who
was sitting in the bow of the canoe into the water. He made him lay off
his mask and threw him into the water. His name was Xa’ya‘la (sound
of stones rolling on the beach). Then the sea began to roll in heavy
waves. The woman ordered him to throw the three other men into the
water. He did so, and they
were tranformed into three
islands, which protect the
beach of the L’a/sq’énox
village. Since that time the
L’a’‘sq’endox use four masks
representing these men in
their marriages,

they go back into the canoe and take their masks off. Figure 6 rep-
resents the mask of Xa’ya/la. I have not seen the three other masks
belonging to the ceremony. The broad band on top of the mask repre-
sents the head ornament of cedar bark which Xa’ya‘la is said to have
worn. The four men receive in payment of their dance a blanket each
from the bridegroom.

At this place I can deseribe only a portion of the ceremonial pre-
scribed for the return of the purchase money and the delivery of the
crest to the son-in-law, as it is in most cases performed as a part of the
winter ceremonial and must be treated in connection with the latter
subject. (See p. 421.) The return of the purchase money is called
qaute’x-a, and the particular manner of return, which will be described
here, LENE’m Xs’a.

The people are all invited to assemble in the house of the wife’s father.

366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

When all the guests have assembled, the father-in-law of the young man
enters, accompanied by his clan. Four of them are carrying the mast
of a canoe, one holding it at the top, another one at the butt, and two
at intermediate points. They walk to the right and stand on the right-
hand side of the door on the front side of the house, facing the middle.!
Then the wife’s father calls his son-in-law, who steps forward and stands
in the right-hand rear corner of the bouse. The other speaker tells
him that the mast represents lids of boxes (g'1/sExstala, see p. 421) tied
together (LEnk"), and that they contain everything that he owes his
son-in-law. The latter replies, asking if the coppers, house, its posts,
and his father-in-law’s names are init also. Even if the old man should
not have intended to give all of this, he must comply with this demand
and promise to give it all to his son-in-law. Next, the young man’s wife
is sent by her father to fetch the copper. She returns, carrying it on
her back, and the young men of her clan bring in blankets. All of this
is given to the young man, who proceeds at once to sell the copper off-
hand. This is called ‘holding the copper at its forehead” (da/g-iue),
In such a case less than one-half of the actual price is paid for the
copper. If it is worth 6,000 blankets, it will bring only 2,500 blankets.
The buyer must pay the price on the spot, and the blankets which the
young man obtains in this manner are distributed by him right away.
By this distribution he obtains the right to live in the house which his
father-in-law has given to him.

Although in most marriages the house and name of the bride’s father
are promised to be transferred to the young man, this is not necessarily
the case. The dower agreed upon may consist only of coppers, canoes,
blankets, and the like.

J learned about a curious instance how a man punished his father-in-
law who had long delayed the return of the purchase-money and was
evidently evading the duty of giving up his name and home to his son-
in-law. The latter carved an image representing his wife and invited
all the people to a feast. Then he put a stone around the neck of the
image and threw it into the sea. Thus he had destroyed the high rank
of his wife and indirectly that of his father-in-law.

V. THE CLAN LEGENDS.

It appears from what has been said before that, in order to fully
understand the various ceremonies, it is necessary to be familiar with
the clan legends. In the following chapter I will give a selection of
legends which will make clear their connection with the carvings used
by each clan and the ceremonials performed on various occasions.

It seems desirable to introduce at this place a fuller description of

the plan of the house than has heretofore been given. The houses of
the Kwakiutl form a square, the sides of which are from 40 to 60 feet
long. (Figs. 7 and 8.) The door (D) is generally in the center of the
side nearest the sea, which forms the front of the house. The latter
has a gable roof, the ridge of which runs from the front to the rear.
The walls consist of boards, which are fastened to a framework of poles.
The sides of the door are formed by two posts (A) from 6 to 8 inches in
diameter and standing about 4 feet apart. Over the door they are con-

nected by a crossbar (B). (Fig. 8.) Sometimes the framework of the
door is made of heavy planks. The framework of the house front con-
sists of two or three vertical poles (C), about 3 inches in diameter, on
each side of the door. They are from 8 to 10 feet apart. Their length
diminishes toward the sides of the house according to the inclination of
the roof. These poles are connected by long crossbars (I), which are
tied to their outer side with ropes of cedar bark at half the distance
between the roof and the ground. The framework of the rear part is
similar to that of the front, but that of the sides is far stronger, as it
368 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

has to support the roof. Two heavy posts (I*), about 9 inches in diam-
eter, are erected. Their heads are cut out and a beam of the same
diameter is laid over them. At the joints it is cut out so as to fit into
the heads of the posts. On both sides of the door and in the corre-
sponding part of the rear side, about 3 feet distant from the central
line of the house, the supports (U) of the roof are erected. These form
the principal part of the framework, and are the first to be made when
the house is built. They stand about 3 feet from the wall, inside the
house. These uprights are about 2 feet in diameter and are generally
connected by a crosspiece (G) of the same diameter. On each side of
the crosspiece rests a heavy beam (H), which runs from the front to the
rear of the house.

ELEVATION AND SECTION OF KWAKIUTL HOUSE.

Sometimes these beams are supported by additional uprights (U’),
which stand near the center of the house. The rafters (R) are laid
over these heavy timbers and the beams forming the tops of the sides.
They are about 8 inches in diameter. Light poles about 3 inches thick
are laid across the rafters. They rest against the vertical poles (C) in the
front and rear of the house. After the heavy framework which supports
the central part of the roof is erected, a bank about 3 feet in height is
raised all around the outlines of the house, its outer side coinciding
with the lines where the walls are to be erected. Long, heavy boards
4 or 5 inches thick are implanted lengthwise along the front of the
house, their upper edges standing 24 or 3 feet above the ground. Then
the earth forming the bank is stamped against them, and thus a

platform is made running along the front of the house. Later on this
is continued all around the house. The framework of the front is the
next to be erected. The poles (C) stand in the dirt forming the plat-
form. The upper edges of the front boards which were implanted into
the ground are grooved, and in this groove the boards forming the
front wall stand. They are tied or nailed to the crossbar (I) and to the
foremost rafter, which is connected with the framework of the front.
The next thing to be done is to make the rear wall and the sides. The
former exactly corresponds to the front, the door only being wanting.
The boards forming the side walls are implanted in the ground, stand-
ing vertically, their upper ends being tied to the beam forming the top
of the framework. The platform running along the inner sides of the
walls is finished by stamping the earth against the side walls. The
roof consists of a peculiar kind of boards, which run from the gable to
the sides of the house. They lap on their edges like Chinese tiles.
This arrangement has the effect that the rain runs from the roof with-
out penetrating into the house. The house front is generally finished
by cutting the boards off along the roof and by finishing them off with
amolding. <A few logs are placed in front of the door, forming steps
(T) that lead to the platform. Steps of the same kind lead from the
platform to the floor of the house. The board forming the inner side
of the platform slopes slightly inward. The house has no smoke
-escape, but several of the boards forming the roof can be pushed aside.
During the night these openings are closed, but in the morning one
board over every fireplace is pushed aside by means of a long pole.
As it is necessary to look after the roof from time to time, a stationary
ladder is leaned against the side of the house. It consists of one-half
of the trunk of a tree or of a heavy board, into the upper side of which
steps are cut.

The house is inhabited by several families, each of whom has a fire-
place of its own. The corners belonging to each family are divided off
from the main room by a rough framework of poles, the top of which
is used for drying fish or other sorts of food. On each side of the fire
stands the immense settee (fig. 11), which is large enough for the whole
family. It hasno feet, is about 7 feet long and 4 feet deep, and its sides
Slope slightly backward, so as to form a convenient support for the
back. Boards are laid along the base of the rear and front platform and
on the side of the fire opposite the settee. The arrangement is some-
times made a little different, the settee being wanting, or in some
instances standing on the rear side. Often long boards are placed
edgewise near the fire, serving as a back support. They are supported
by plugs which are rammed into the floor and Jean slightly backward,
thus forming a convenient back support. The bedrooms have the form
of small houses which are built on the platform running around the
house. Most of these bedrooms have gable roofs, aud their fronts
are finished off with moldings. The section c—d (fig. 8) explains the

arrangement better than any description can do. Sometimes these
rooms are enlarged by adding a low extension to the house, the floor
of which is elevated as high as the platform. In the center of such
rooms there is a small fire-
place. The plans of the
houses of the separate
gentes show slight differ-
ences. In some instances
the heavy beams (H) rest on
the uprights (U), the cross-
piece (G) being wanting
(fig. 9). In other instances
there is only a single timber
resting on the crosspiece
(G). When festivals are
celebrated, all the parti-
tions, seats, and fires are
removed, and one large fire
is built in the center of the
house. For such occasions

The houses generally face the beach and are builtin arow. (See fig. 26,
p. 391.) In front of the town there is a street, which is carefully leveled,
the lower side being supported by an embankment of heavy logs. From
here steps lead down to the beach, where the canoes are lying. Oppo-

platforms; summer seats, on which the Indians pass most of their time,

I proceed now to a discussion of the clan legends.

First of all, it is necessary to describe and enumerate a number of
supernatural beings who may become the supernatural helpers of man,
as they appear over and
over again in the clan
legends. Besides a num-
ber of animals, such as
wolves, bears, sea lions,
and killer whales, which,
however, do not play a
very important part as
protectors of man, we
find principally a num-
ber of fabulous monsters
whose help was obtained
by the ancestors, and
who therefore have

clan. THE SI'SIUL.

From a painting by a Kwakiutl Indian.

Perhaps the most
important among these is the si/siut, the fabulous double-headed
Snake, which has one head at each end, a human head in the middle,
one horn on each terminal head, and two on the central human
head. (Fig. 10.) It has the power to assume the shape of a fish.
To eat it and even to touch or to see it is sure death, as all the
joints of the unfortunate one become dislocated, the head being
turned backward. But to those who enjoy supernatural help it may
372 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

bring power; its blood, wherever it touches the skin, makes it as
hard as stone; its skin used as a belt enables the owner to per-
form wonderful feats; it may become a canoe which moves by the
motions of the si’siuL fins; its eyes, when used as sling stones, kill
even whales. It is essentially the helper of
warriors.

I give here a few forms in which the si/siuL
is represented (figs. 11,12. See also, figs.
166-169, pp. 514, 515, Plate 15). In fig.
12 only one-half of the
si’siuL is Shown. The ter- p
minal head, with its horn
laid backward, is plainly
seen. The upper line be-
hind the head designates
the body, from which down-
ward and forward extends

central horns is shown
over the point of attachment of the leg.

Another being which figures largely in the clan
legends of the Kwakiutl is the Ts’0/noqoa, a wild
woman who resides in the woods. She is repre-
sented as having enormous breasts and as ecarry-
ing a basket, into which she puts children whom
she steals in order to eat them. Her eyes are
hollow and shine with a wild luster. She is asleep
most of the time. Her mouth is pushed forward,
as she is, when awake, constantly uttering her ery,
“a, hn, ti, a.” This figure belongs to a great many
clan legends, and is often represented on house posts
or on masks (figs. 13, 14).

The following tradition describes this spirit quite
fully:

The first of the L’A/sq’éndx lived at XanX. On
the one side of the river lived the clan W1’sEnts’a.
One day the children went across the river to play
there. They made a house of fir branches and played
in it. One of the boys went out of the house and occ. posr in xur
he discovered a giantess who was approaching the = 14/srE_ RePRESENT-
house. He told his friends, who came running ‘°™™ ™°*0R%
out of the house. The giantess was chewing gum
which was as red as blood. The children wanted to have some
of the gum. Then she called them and gave them some. They
asked her: ‘‘Where do you get your gum?” ‘Come,” she replied,

Fig. 14.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 313

“J will point it out to you.” Then the children crept into the basket
which she carried on her back and she went into the woods. She was
AO’/xLaax (or Ts’0‘noqoa). She carried them far into the woods. Then
she put the gum on their eyes and carried them to her house. She was
a cannibal. Among the children were two sons of the chief of the
Wi'sEnts’a; LO/pEk”’axstEliL' was the name of thechief. His wife was
LE/wag-ilayugoa. Then she cried, and sometimes she would blow her
nose and throw the mucus on the ground. Suddenly she discovered a
little boy lying on his back on the floor. He had originated from the
mucus of hernose. She took the boy up and carried him into the house.
He grew very quickly; after four days he was quite strong. Then he
asked for a bow and two arrows. Now he was called LE/ndEqoayats’E-
waL. When he had received his bow and arrows, LE/wag-ilayuqoa
asked him not to go across the river, but he did so against her re-
quest. He followed the trail which he found on the other side. He
came toa houseand entered. There he saw children sitting on the floor,
and awoman named L’0/pEk’axstEliL, who was rooted to the floor. The
latter spoke: “Don’t stay long, Chief! Sheis gone after water; if she
should come back, she will kill you.” Then he went out and followed the
trail. All of a sudden he saw the Ts’0’‘noqoa coming. She carried a
bueket in each hand. The little boy climbed a tree, in order to hide in
its branches. The Ts’0/noqoa saw his image in the water and made love
to him. She looked up and discovered him. Then she called him to
come down. Now he came down to her and that woman asked him:
“Tow does it happen that you look so pretty?” The boy said: “I put
my head between two stones.” She replied: ‘‘Then I will take two
stones too.” He sent her to fetch two stones and soon she came back
carrying them. She put them down. The boy said: ‘ Now lie down
on your back.” Then the boy put the one stone under her head and
told her to shut her eyes. Then he took the other stone and dropped
it as hard as he could on her head. Her head was smashed and her
brains were scattered. She was dead. The boy broke her bones with
the stones and threw them into the water. Then he went into her
house. As soon as he had entered, the woman who was rooted to the
floor said: ‘Now do not stay long. I know that you have tried to
kill the Ts’0/noqoa. It is the fourth time that somebody tried to kill
her. She never dies; she has nearly come to life. There in that cov-
ered hemlock branch (knothole?) is her life. Go there, and as soon as
you see her enter shoot her life. Then she will be dead.” She had
hardly finished speaking when the Ts’0/‘noqoa came in, singing as she
walked:

I have the magical treasure,
I have the supernatural power,
I can return to life.

That was her song. Then the boy shot at her life. She fell dead to the
floor. Then the boy took her and threw her into the hole in which she

was going to roast the children. He washed their eves with urine and
took them home to XanX. They were all alive again. Then LE/ndE-
qoayats’EwaL went back to heaven.

Of less frequent occurrence is the spirit of th esea, Q’0’/modqoa, the
protector of the seals, who kills hunters. There are a number of tales
relating how he took the ancestor of a tribe to the bottom of the sea
and gave him his crest. I will give here a legend of the clan G:éxsEm,
of the La/Lasiqoala, which shows how they came into the possession of
the Q’o/moqoa carving: O”’meaL, the Raven, the ancestor of the clan
G-e/xsEm, had a daughter named Ha/taqa. One day the crow, who was
O”’meatL’s sister, and Ha/taqa went down to the beach to gather sea
urchins. Soon they had filled their baskets. The crow carried them
into the woods, broke the shells, and prepared them. Then she offered
some to Ha/taqa, who refused them, for fear of her father. The crow,
however, promised that he would not tell on her, and prompted Ha/taqa
to eat of the sea urchins. She had hardly begun to eat when the crow
jumped upon a log of driftwood, shouting, ‘““Qax, qax, qax, qax!
Ha/‘taqa is stealing sea urchins.” Ha/taqa asked her, ‘‘ Please stop, and
I will give you my blanket.” The crow, however, did not cease shout-
ing, although Ha‘taqa offered her her bracelets of abalone shells. But
already O”’meaL had heard what the crow said. He was enraged, and
ordered his tribe to load their canoes and to extinguish the fires. Then
he and his whole tribe left Ha/taqa all alone in the deserted village.
Ha‘taqa’s grandmother, however, had pity upon the girl, and before
she left she had hidden some fire in a shell. A dog and a bitch were
the only living beings that were left in the village besides Ha’‘taqa.
As soon as the canoes were out of sight, the dog, by dint of scratching
and howling, attracted her attention to the shell. She found the glow-
ing embers and started a fire. She built a hut of cedar twigs, in which
she lived with her dogs. The following morning she sent them into the
woods and ordered them to fetch withes. They obeyed, and Ha/taqa
made four fish baskets. At low water she placed them on the beach,
and at the next tide she found them full of fish. But on looking more
closely she discovered a man in one of them, Aik-a’a’yolisana, the son
of (’d’mogoa. He came from out of the basket, carrying a small
box. He said to her, ‘Carry this small box to your house. I came
to marry you.” Although the box was small, Ha’/taqa was unable
to lift it, and he had to carry it himself. When he arrived in front of
the house, he opened it, and, behold! a whale was in it. Aik-a’a/yoli-
sana built a large house and married Ha’taqa. Then he invited all
the tribes and distributed the whale meat. His descendants use his
mask (fig. 15), and when it is shown, sing as follows:

It is a tale which came down to us from the beginning of the world.

You came up, bringing the house of Q’o/moqoa, you ‘Growing rich,”

“Wealth coming ashore,” ‘‘Covered with wealth,” ‘‘Mountain of property.”
“Really great Mountain.” It is a tale which came down to us from the beginning
of the world.!

“Whatever the tradition of the clan may be, the figures with which
house and implements are ornamented refer to this legend. I am not
familiar with all the legends, which often are quite trivial, merely stating
that the ancestor met such and such a being. I give here a number of
figures, which willillustrate the connection between the clan legend and
the ornamentation of various objects. Fig. 16 shows the house front of
the clan G-é/xsEm of the La/Lasiqoala. It represents the thunder bird
squatting over the door, and
thesun ateach side. While
the former belongs to the
G-ée/xsEm, the sun was ob-
tained from the clan Q’o‘m-
k-utis of the Goasi‘la. Fig.

each side of the door are the
crest of this clan, which was
obtained by their ancestor

Kue’xagvila, the son of Ha/‘taga. (See p. 374.) Around the door is the
crest of the mother of the house owner, who belonged to the Goasi’la tribe.
It represents the moon, G-a‘loyaqamé (=the very first one), and inside
the ancestor of the clan, LE/Inakulag:ilak-as’0, who was taken up to the
moon by G-a/loyaqame. The feet of this figure are drawn like frog’s feet,
but I did not learn any particular reason for this fact. Fig. 18 shows
the house front of the clan G-i/g-ilqam of the Nimkish. It represents the

thunder bird lifting a whale, which is its food, from out of the water.
According to the clan tradition, the G-i’g:ilqgam are the descendants of
the thunder bird. This house front was excellently painted, but has been
whitewashed, owing to the misplaced zeal of a missionary. The beak
was carved and fastened to the house front. The owner had one of his
coppers tied te the pole on ton of the house. In fig. 20 is shown a house
post which represents a sea lion. I was not able to learn to what clan it
belongs. It is found in a house at Xumta/spé with the post shown in fig.
36,p. 414. Theowner belongs to theclan G-e’xsEm, of the Naq6/mgvilisala.
The carving is said to have come from Ya/qaL’nala (Hope Island), which
is the territory of the La/Lasiqoala. When the Naq6/mg-ilisala moved

explanation. It belongs to the subdivision Mé/Emaqiaé (Mée/Emaqaua
in the Naq6/mgvilisala dialect) of the Naq6’mg-ilisala. These are the
descendants of Le/laxa (=coming often from above) the son of Q’e’q’a-
qaualis, whose legend will be found below (p. 416). Their original
home is the island G-ig-é/LEm, one of the small islands southeast of
Hope Island. Lela/k-kn was a later chief of the clan. His daughter
was Lao/noquméqa. They moved to the island Q’oa’/sqEmlis and built
a village. The chief made a statue like the one represented here. It
is hollow behind and its mouth isopen. In the potlatch the chief stands
behind the mouth of the statue and speaks through it, thus indicating
that it is his ancestor who is speaking. L#Ela’/k-En had one dish repre-

shape of a bear. As the man who made the
present statue was too poor to have all these
carvings made, he had them carved on the statue
instead.

Figure 21 represents a totem pole, which was
standing until a few years ago in front of a house
in Xumta/spe (Newettee). The crest belongs to
the subdivision G@’ék’’o’té of the clan G-i’g-ilqam.
According to the legend, these people are the
descendants of G’ote, the son of K-épusaladqoa,
the youngest daughter of Kué/xag-ila, the son of
Hataqa, the daughter of O’meaL. (See p.374.)
They have the Ts’0/noqoa, a man split in two,
another man, wolf, beaver, and the sea monster
ts’e’qie for dishes. A man named NE’mqkEmalis
married a daughter of the G’eg’0’té chief, and he
had allthese dishes made. Lateron, aman named
Qoayo/LElas married NE/mqkEmalis’s cousin.
Then he was told to unite
the dishes and to carve a
totem pole. He did so.
The second figure from
below is placed upside
down because the dish
was in the back of the
man, while all the others
were in the bellies of the
carvings. This history
may also explain the fact
that all the figures are
separated on this column,

poles they overlap, one

given by Q’a/nig-ilak", the great transformer, who, it is said, made two
houses of dirt, one for himself, one for his brother NEmo’gwis. He blew
upon them and they grew large. He called the first Qoa/qoak-imlilas

four men of cedar wood, and called them T’oxtowa’lis, QaLqap’alis,
K’etoqalis, and Bebekumlisi/la. He made them alive and they lived
in his house. Three of these men are represented on the posts. There
was another post, on which the fourth one was carved, but it was so
rotten that the owner of the house removed it. Post No. 1 (fig. 22)
represents on top QaLqap’alis, below a Ts’0‘noqoa, which the owner

sold for the post (0’ma’yu), its price. The figure underneath is a
bear (nan), which belongs to the clan
La‘lauiLEla of the same tribe. Figure

the same house. On top the figure of
of Bebekumlisi/la is seen. The bear

put his copper under the stone. Therefore the stone
received the name ‘“‘copper under it.” Then he said
he had received the stone as price for his copper.
Now they arrived at Ts’a’wate. Then he used his staff
with a copper on top. A hand was on top also. Then
he gave a feast to many tribes, and changed his name
and took the name Kuax-‘ilano/kumeé. 1’a’/qoag-ila-
qEmaeé was now the nameof his successor; Ts’Ama was
the name of another child of his. That is the end.
(Appendix, p. 673.)

There is one legend which is of importance in this
connection, because the rank of the various names and
the laws governing potlatch and feast are derived
from it. I give here a version of the tale, which,
however, is not quite complete and requires some ad-
ditional remarks. It is the legend of O’maxt’a/laLé,
the clan legend of the G-1’g‘ilqgam of the Q’o/moyue:

A bird was sitting on the beach at TE’/ng‘is. He
took off his mask, and then his name was NEm0/gwis.
He became aman. Then he moved to K’a’qa. He
had a son whom he named O’maxt’a/laLe. The child
grew up fast; he became a real man. He was very
strong. He walked with his uncle Lo’La’watsa on the
beach of Tsa‘xis and clubbed seals. They were walk-
ing back and fro clubbing seals. Then NEm0/gwis
spoke to his younger brother LO/La’watsa: “ Friend,
don’t let us go on in this manner. Let us try to ar-
range that our son may go out to sea.” He desired
to have more game than the sea otters and seals
which they were able to club on the beach of T'sa/xis.
Therefore they wanted to go to the islands. Then
NEm0’egwis and his younger brother burnt the inside
of a cedar and burnt its ends, thus making a canoe.
They finished it. Then they launched the canoe that
they had made for the child. They tried the canoe
that the child was to use when going to Deer Island.
O’maxt’?aaLeé was annoyed, and when he came back,
his canoe was full of sea otters and seals. He kept
on going out every day and caught many sea otters
and seals. Then he said: “Let us try to discover
how many tribes there are. Let someone go and eall
them.” Then NEm0/gwis’s younger brother LO/La’-
watsa paddled. He was going to La’la’/té to eall
Hai/alik‘awae. Then he arrived at Qag’axstE’Is and
called Ma‘tagla. HearrivedatG”’otaqa’laand called

L’a/xLaqoaXLa the Lau‘itsis, who, it is said, was aman. He arrived at
Séatvé and called Ma‘leleqala. He moved on and came to La’L’a-
quxta. There he called TX’E/nXq’aid. He arrived at Ta’yaxqoL and
called La‘laxsEnt’aio. Then he went to the town at Q’0/quée’taxsta’yo
and called Wa/xap’alaso. Then he went up the bay to A’g-iwa’laa and
called Nu’mas. Then he went up the Sound to LiXsi/wae and called
Sa/e-iye. He came to XutsEtsa’lis and called YiXa’qEmae. Then he
went to the right side of the river of LiXsi/wae and called SH/niaé.
Then he paddled to O’s’eq and called He‘ilik-inakula; then to Na/lax-
Lala near the mouth of Ts’a’wate and called Ya’/xLEn.

Meanwhile the child of Nemo’gwis was clubbing and harpooning
seals for his father’s feast. His house was already full of sea otter
furs, which were used for blankets by the people of old. They were
sewed together. Now the tribes gathered. He met his guests and
distributed seals among them. He gave them their seats and gave his
gifts to the chiefs. Nemo’gwis kept for them the belly part. He gave
the hind legs to the chiefs of another tribe. He gave the flippers to
the second-class chiefs, and the bodies to the common people. He gave
each clan its place. He gave the bellies to the highest chief. He bit
off these parts and had messengers to pass them on to his guests. It
is said he bit off whatever he gave to his guests. Then he was
called Walas Nemo’gwis and he called his successor O’maxt’a/laLe.
Then he gave out the blankets to all the clans, giving the law for later
generations. Some of the guests stayed with him and became his
tribe.

Now O’maxt’a/laLé said to his father: “I shall goa little farther this
time. Do not expect me; but first I will go bathing.” Then
O’maxt’a/laLé went in the morning. After he had bathed he heard the
sound of adzes. He made up his mind to look where the sound came
from, because the sound was near when he first heard it. But it moved
away as he followed it and O’maxt’a/laLé came to a pond. He bathed
again and the sound came still nearer. He followed the sound, which
was going before him. He came to another pond and bathed again.
Then the sound of adzes came still nearer. He followed it as 1t went
before him. Now he found still another pond. He bathed, and the
sound came still nearer. He went toward it and now he saw a canoe.
A man was sitting in the canoe working on it with his adze. In the
bow of the canoe lay a harpoon shaft and two paddles. O’maxt’a’/laLé
stood behind the man. Hewas the grouse. Then O’maxt’a/laLé spoke:
“Thank you, that I have found what you are working on.” The
grouse looked at him and disappeared. Thus O’maxt’a/laLe found the
canoe, the harpoon shaft, and the paddle.

Then he put his nettle line into his canoe. He and his uncle
1’0/L’awatsa went out. He went across the Sound trying to reach
Noomas Island. Then he saw a canoe coming from YaaiXugiwano.
They met at Noomas Island, and held the sides of each other’s canoe.
384 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

‘“Good day, brother,” said O’maxt’a‘laLé to Qa/watiliqala, “I do not
come without purpose. My father sent me, because you are the only
one whose daughter I will marry.” Qa/‘watiliqala replied: “Paddle
behind me and follow me to my house.” O’maxt’a/laLé said: “I will
give you my harpoon line, friend, my nettle line, my harpoon shaft, and
my mat.” Qa/watiliqala then gave his leather line to his brother and
they exchanged their canoes and everything in the canoes that they
used. Then O’maxt’a’laLé said: “Let us go back. That smoke
belongs to our house.” ‘ No,” replied Qa‘watiliqala, ‘‘Let us go on to
my house. You said you wanted to be engaged to my daughter.”
Then the two paddled side by side together. They reached the lower
part of the river at Gua/é. ‘Take care, brother, when we enter my
house. When we enter my house, follow close on my heels,” said
Qa/‘watiliqala. He told his brother that the door of his house was dan-
gerous. They walked up to the door together. The door had the
shape of a raven. It opened and they jumped in and the raven
snapped at him. All the images in Qa’watiliqala’s house were alive,
the posts were alive, and the si/siuL beams. Then O’maxt’a/laLé mar-
ried Wilx:stasilayuqoa, the daughter of Qa‘watiliqala. The house and
the images and all kinds of food were given him in marriage, and blan-
kets of lynx, marmot, wolverine, mink, and dressed elk skins. Then
his father-inlaw and his tribe brought him home. They brought
everything, also the house. He built a houseat K’a’qa. That is why
the place is called K-’a’qa, because logs were placed all around for the
foundation of the house which he had obtained in marriage. Then
Omaxt’a/laLé invited all the tribes with what he had obtained in mar-
riage from his wife. (See Appendix p. 675.)

In the feast referred to in the preceding legend NEm0/gwis is said to
have given each of his guests his seat, which their descendants have
retained. He also arranged how the parts of the seal with which he
fed his guests were to be distributed. The chest was given to the head
chief, the next in rank received the hind flippers, and the young men
of the nobility the fore flippers. He also instituted at the feast the
laws according to which blankets are given away and returned later on.

This legend is so important that I will give another version which I
obtained at Fort Rupert:

NeEm0/ewis lived in a village at Wékawayaas. He was the ancestor
of the G:i/gilqam of the Q’o’moyue. He wore the sun mask on his
face. He hada slave named ‘7o’yatsa and hada boy. This son was
growing up quickly and he came to be aman. Now NEmo/’gwis took
a walk and saw a village at Ta’yaguL. There he saw a man who wore
a bird mask sitting on the ground. The mask had a small hooked nose.
Then Nemo/gwis spoke to him: “O brother! thank you for meeting
me here. Who are you?” The other one replied, ‘1 am Ts’E/nXqaio,
brother.” Then NEm0/gwis asked Ts’E/n Xqaio: ‘ Who is living in the
house beyond!” Ts’h/nXqaio replied: “I do not know him.” N&rmo’-
gwis walked on to the east end of Ta’yaguL, where the other house was
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 385

standing. He discovered an old man sitting outside the house. He
wore a bird mask. NEm0/gwis spoke: ‘O, brother! thank you for meet-
ing me here. Who are you?” The old man replied: “I am La‘laX-
sEnt’aid.” Then NEmo/gwis asked him: ‘‘ Who is living in the house at
the river?” lLa/laXskEnt’aid replied: ‘“‘I do not know him.” Then
NrEm0‘ewis walked on and arrived at Tsa’/xis. There he beheld a man
sitting on the summer seat outside the house, and NEm0’gwis spoke to
him and said: “‘O, brother! thank you for meeting me here, Who
are you?” The man replied at once: “Iam Kuax-ilano/kumé and my
tribe are the G-i’g-ilqam.” And he asked NEm0/gwis: ‘* Who are you,
brother? Where is your village?” Nk&m0/gwis replied: “I am NEm6/-
gwis. My younger brother is Bo/nakwala. We and my son, we three,
live in my village, Wekawayaas.” Then spoke Kuax:-ilano/kumé:
“Thank you, brother, for meeting me here.” And NEm0’gwis went
home to Wékawayaas. When he arrived there, he told his younger
brother and his son what he had seen.

He spoke to his son: ‘ O, child, see the sea otters, the seals, and the
sea lions on Shell Island.” Then his son wanted to go there. Bo/na-
kwala and o/yatsa rolled a driftloginto the water. The son of NEmo’-
gwis was to use it in place of a canoe. They brought it to the beach in
front of NEm0/gwis’s house and showed it to the young man. He sat
on top of it and went to the island in order to club sea otters and seals.
When he arrived at the island he began clubbing the sea otters and
seals. He finished, and put them on his drift log. Then he went home.
Bo‘nakwala and yo’yatsa met him on the beach and they unloaded the
log. NEmod/gwis spoke: “O, child, now your name is O’maxt’a/laLé on
account of your game.” He invited Ts’E/nXqaio and La/laXsEnt/aid
and Kuax‘iland/kumeé and Ma/tag:ila. The four men came to the house
and satdown. Then Bo/nakwala put stones into the fire and singed the
seal. When he had done so, he cut it up. He filled the kettle with
water and then threw the red-hot stones into the water until it began to
boil. Then he put the pieces of seal meat into the boiling water and
added more red-hot stones. After a short while the seal was done.
Bo/nakwala took the meat out of the water, and NEm0/gwis took the
breast piece first. He bitit and gave it to Ts’E/nXqaio, saying: “You
shall always be the first one to receive his share, and you shall always
have the breast piece.” Next he took the hind leg and gave it to
Kuax‘ilano/kumé, saying: “ You shall always have this piece, and it
Shall be given to you next to Ts’E/nXqaio.” Then he took up the
foreleg of the seal, bitit, and gave it to Ma’/tag-ila, saying: ‘‘ You shall
always have this piece.” Then he gave a whole seal to Ts’hnXqaio,
Kuax-ilano/kumeé, and Ma/tag-ila, and told them thename of his son. He
said: “I invited you to show you my son. This is O’maxt’a/laLé.”
Bo/nakwala now addressed the guests. Therefore the people nowa-
days make speeches in their feasts, because NEm0/ewis began making
speeches and distributing blankets and canoes among all the tribes.

After the feast they all left the house. Bo/nakwala looked for a good
log of cedar wood. He found one and brought it to the beach in front
of NEm0/guis’s house. When the tide had fallen, he burnt its ends and
the middle, thus hollowing it out. It was to be the canoe of O’maxt’a’-
late. As soon as it was completed, he gave it to O’maxt’a/laLé. The
latter went at once to Shell Island and clubbed sea otters. He did not
club any hair seals. When he came home, Bo/nakwala and ‘yo/7atsa
skinned the sea otters. Then Bo/nakwala spoke: ‘O, child! O’maxt?-
alae! I will go now. Do not feel uneasy if I should stay away long.”
O’maxt’alaLe replied: ‘‘Go on, but take good care of yourself.” His
uncle Bo/nakwala went and came to Ga/yux. At night he bathed in
water and rubbed his body with hemlock branches. On the following
morning he went on and heard the sound of an adze close to where he
was. He went up to the sound. Then it stopped, and reappeared a
long ways off. Then Bo/nakwala went again, and bathed in the water
and rubbed his body with hemlock branches. He went on and again
he heard the sound of an adze near by. He went to see what it was,
and again the sound stopped and reappeared a long ways off. He
went at once to the water and bathed again and rubbed his body with
hemlock branches. He went on and heard again the sound of an adze
near by. When he went up to the sound it stopped, and reappeared a
long ways off. Again he bathed and rubbed his body with hemlock
branches. When he had finished, he went on and suddenly he beheld
a pretty hunting canoe lying on the ground. He went up to it and
pushed it into the water, into the river of Ga/yux. He went in it down
the river. In the canoe were two paddles anda harpoon. He rested
at the mouth of the river and then paddled home to Wékawayaas.
When he arrived at the beach of NEm0/gwis’s house, O’maxt’a/laLé came
down to meet him. Then Bo/nakwala spoke: ‘‘O, child, I obtained a
eanoe for you.” O’maxt’a/laLé made ready at once to go to Shell
Island and asked the slave o’yatsa to steer the canoe. ‘They started,
and when they arrived at Shell Island, O’maxt’a/laLé clubbed the sea
otters. Then he loaded his canoe, which was full of sea otters. When
they were going home, the slave said: ‘O, master, let me see how you
spear a sea otter with your harpoon.” Then O’maxt’a/laLé said: “Steer
toward that sea otter and I will spear it.” The slave turned the bow
of the canoe toward the sea otter and O’maxt’a’/laLe threw and hit it.
Then they returned home. When they arrived at the beach, Bo’na-
kwala came to meet them. They unloaded the canoe, and bo‘nakwala
and o’/yatsa skinned the sea otters and stretched the skins. After
that they ate. Then O’maxt’a/laLé spoke: ‘“O, father! I will go and
see who lives east of us.” NEm06/gwis replied: ‘Child, beware of
storms when you cross the sea. Go, and take ‘jo/7qatsa along.” Early
the next day O’maxt’alaLé and ‘yo’ratsa started. They spread the
sea-otter skins over the bottom of their canoe and paddled straight
across to the north end of the island at the mouth of Knight Inlet.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 387

When he approached YaaiXugiwano, he saw a canoe with two men
coming up. O’maxt’a/laLe paddled toward this canoe. When the
canoes were side by side, the men took hold of each other’s gunwale
and O’maxt’a/laLé said: ‘‘Where are you going, brother?” The one
in the bow of the other canoe replied: ‘*‘ Brother, | am hunting among
these islands here. I thank you for meeting me here. I am Qa/wati-
liqala. Who are you, brother?” O’maxt’a’/laLe replied: “Thank you,
brother, for meeting me here. I am O’maxt’a/laLe. Let us go to my
house, the smoke of which we see there on the other side. It is not far.
Come, take my canoe; it is yours now.” Then Qa/watiliqala spoke:
‘Brother, now this my canoe is yours and everything that is in it.”
He meant the mountain goat skins with which it was covered and his
harpoon. But O’maxt’a‘laLe’s canoe was all covered with sea-otter
skins. His blanket was made of sea otter and his harpoon line of the
guts of the sea lion, while Qa/watiliqala’s line was of cedar bark and
his blanket made of mountain goat skin. O’maxt’a/laLé spoke: “Thank
you, brother. Now come across to your canoe and let me go into the
canoe you gave me.” Qa/watiliqala arose and went into O’maxt/a’-
laLé’s canoe, and O’maxt’a‘laLé arose and went into Qa/watiliqala’s
canoe. This was as though they had exchanged their hearts so that
they had only one heart now.

Then Qa’‘watiliqala spoke: ‘“‘That is done. Now, brother, come to
my house. It is beyond this point.” They paddled on, and when they
had nearly reached Qa/watiligala’s house, he said: ‘* Brother, take care.
When I jump into my house, you and your slave must jump in at the
same time.” Now they arrived at the beach in front of the house of
Qa’watiliqala. They went ashore and walked up to the house. When
they arrived in front of the house, the mouth of the door of Qa/watili-
qala’s house opened. They jumped in all at the same time and it bit
only a corner of Lo/Latsa’s blanket. Then tbe posts at the sides of the
door spoke, and the one to the right-hand side said: ‘“ You made them
come to your house, Qa/watiliqala;” and the post on the left-hand side
said: ‘* Now spread a mat and give your guests to eat, Chief.” It is said
that the cross-beams over the rear posts were double-headed snakes
(si’siuL), which were constantly playing with their tongues. The posts
in the rear of the house were wolves, and a grizzly bear was under each
of the wolves. Carved images were all round the house. O’maxt’a/laL
and Lo’/Latsa were sitting in the house and were given mountain goat
meat to eat. When they had finished eating, the speaker of the house
said: “What do you want here?” Now O’maxt’a/laLe beheld the
daughter of Qa’watiliqala, who was sitting in the rear of the house.
He thought: “I will say that I came to marry her.” Then the thought
hearer of the house spoke: “Chief O’maxt’a/laLé came to marry Qa/wa-
tiliqala’s princess.” Qa/watiliqala said at once: ‘“O, brother! thank you
that you want to marry my daughter. It has been my desire that
you should marry her, brother O’maxt’a/laLé. Now you marry ny prin-
cess and you shall have this house for your house as a gift from your

Thus spoke Qa‘ watiliqala to O’maxt’a/laLée. The latter replied: ‘Thank
you, Chief Qa’watiliqala. Iam glad on account of your speech, father-
in-law. Now teach me the songs of the dance Walas’axa’, for I will at
once invite all the tribes when I reach home.” Thus spoke O’maxt’a’-
laLe.

The speaker of the house said: “O, Chief Qa/watiliqala! Let us
have the winter ceremonial to-night, that our son-in-law may see our
ways.” Qa’‘watiliqala answered: “My speaker, your advice is good,”
and, turning to the wolf posts of the house, he continued: ‘‘ Now take
care, friends, you, QEm0’ta’yalis, and you, QEmotilElag:ilis. Howl, that
our friends G-alalaLila and his children may come.” When he had
finished, O’maxt’a/laLé said: ‘O, father-in-law! I now invite you and
your tribe to bring my house, myself, and my wife to my place. I can
not withstand your words, father-in-law! I say, thank you! Now let
me watch your supernatural dances to-night, else I shall not know
what you are doing in this great dance.”

At night the speaker of the house said: ‘‘Now, magicians, howl!
that G-alalanila and his children may come.” Then QEm0’ta’yalis and
QEmOtilElag‘ilis, the posts of the house, howled four times each. At
once a howl like theirs was heard back of the house. Then Qa/watill-
qala called his tribe, the ancestors of the Ts’a’/watHenOx. They entered
their chief’s house, and as soon as they had assembled the wolves came
in. All the men cried: ‘ Yihii, hu, hu, ha, hu, hu!” Four times they
did so, and then they sang:

These are all the songs I know. If you will go to the Ts’f/watkén6dx
you can learn all the forty songs of the Walas’axa’.

When the dance of the wolves was at an end, Qa/watiliqala said :
“‘O, friends, I invited you, my tribe, that you may know that I give my
daughter in marriage to O’maxt’a‘laLé, chief of the G-i’g-ilqgam on the
other side. Now let us go and take our son-in-law, his wife, and his
house home. And he shall take this great dance. Let us go to-
morrow !” Then the people left the house and the next day they made
ready to start. They went across, taking the house and Qa/watiliqala’s
daughter. They stopped at Ga/yuX. They built a foundation of drift
logs. In four days they finished the house.

Then O’maxt’a/laLé went to tell his father Nemo/gwis. He entered
the house and said: ‘*Come, father! let us go to my house at Ga/yux.
I have married the daughter of Qa/watiliqala. I brought my father-
in-law and his tribe, and also the house and the great dance Walas’-
axa’, and a great box and three baskets. I do not know what is in
them.” Nermo’gwis replied: ‘Let us invite Ts’E/nXqaio and La‘laX-
sEnt’aid and Kuax:ilano’kumaé, that they may see your house.” And
he sent Bo’nakwala to invite the tribes. Then O’maxt’a/laLé and his
father went, and O’maxt’a‘/laLé said: ‘Take care, father! As soonas I
jump through the door of my house you jump with me.” When they
arrived at the house, the mouth of the door opened and the father and
son jumped in. Then the posts said: “Goon! greet them who come
into your house, Chief!” NEm0‘gwis spoke: “ Welcome, Brother Qa/wa-
tiliqala. Ihave heard about you. I thank you for having given your
daughter and your house to my son.” Qa/‘watiliqala replied: “O,
brother, I am glad that I have seen you. From now on your name
will be Great NEmo’gwis (Wa‘las NEmo’gwis). This box filled with
eurried skin blankets is for you, and the basket filled with marten
Skins, the one filled with mink skins, and this one filled with lynx
blankets.” Then O’maxt’a’/late left his house, because he heard men
speaking outside. He saw his uncle Bo/nakwala and the guests whom
he had invited. Then O’maxt’a‘laLe said: “Now let us jump into my
house all at the same time.” When they were all ready, the door
opened and they all jumped in. Then the posts spoke: “Go on! greet
them who come into your house, Chief!” The guests sat down, and
were given to eat. When they had finished, they performed the winter
ceremonial. O’maxt’a/laLe showed the Walas’axa’. Afterwards he
gave Sea otters to Qa’/watiliqala’s tribe, and he gave blankets made of
curried leather, marten blankets, mink blankets, and lynx blankets to
Ts’B/nX qaiod, La/laxsEnt’aio, and Kuax‘ilano/kumaé. His winter dance
lasted four days. He was the first who gave away blankets to all the
tribes, and who gave a seal feast. That is the end.

Before leaving this subject I must mention that all the clans authen-
ticate the claim to their rank and to the greatness of their ancestor by
telling of a meeting between him and one of the two deities which
prevail in the mythology of these tribes, Q’a/nig-ilak" in the Newettee
390 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

group, and Kueékuaxa/oeé among the other tribes. The La/lauiLeEla of
the La/Lasiqoala, for instance, say that their ancestor, NomasE/nxeélis,
knew that Q’a/nig:ilak" was coming. Then he told his son LExx:a/lix‘i-
la’yu to go to Xu/spalis (Newettee Bar) and there to await Q’a/nig-ilak”’s
arrival. He himself remained, and was transformed by Q’a‘nig-ilak"
into a stone, which may still be seen on Hope Island. LExx:a/lix-ila’yu
went to Xu/spalis, but Q’a/nigilak" did not molest him, because he was
afraid of him.

The G-i’gilqam of the same tribe say that he met O”’meaL, who
pointed his forefinger at him when he sawhim coming. At once his head
was perforated. Q’a/nigilak" retaliated, and
they saw that they were equally strong.

Ido not need to enter into these legends
any farther, because they are all of the same
character and are merely intended to show
that the ancestors of these clans were pres-
ent at the time of the transformation of men
into animals, and that they were as strong
as the deity himself. For the details of the
(Q’a/nigilak" legend I refer to my book.'

With this I will leave the clan legends and
their connection with the crest and the pot-
latch. Incidentally I will mention here that
figures commemorating . distributions of
property, the breaking of coppers, and
grease feasts are often placed on top of the
house or on the poles. To this class belongs

a housein Alert Bay (fig. 25). Other statues
of the same class are shown in Plate 18,
representing a chief who gives away coppers in a feast, and Plate 19,
representing a chief breaking a copper. This last figure is placed on
top of the house at the time when the father-in-law refunds the purchase
money with which his daughter has been bought.

In order to convey a better idea of the arrangement of the whole vil-
lage, I give here a sketch of the village of Newettee as it appeared in
1886 from a sketch taken by myself at that time (fig. 26). The names
printed in Roman letters designate the names of the houses, those in
Italics names of mountains on Galiano Island, and the one in Italic capi-
tals is the name of the bay. The house Wa/‘tsuxiioa will be recognized
as fig. 17 (p.377). The post in front of it is shown in fig. 21 (p. 380).

I have referred several times to the fact that the clans also have
peculiar carvings which are used as dishes. A few of these are repre-
sented on Plates 20 and 21 and in figs. 27-34. The dish shown in the
upper figure of Plate 20 represents the Ts’0/noqoa (see figs. 13 and 14,

p- 372). That shown in the next figure on the left of the same plate
represents a man and a snake.

From the fact that so many carvings have reference to the clan totem
we must not conclude that each and every animal or human figure found
on any implement has the same
meaning. It seems to me that the
strong impulse which the art of
these people received from the devel-
opment of totemistic ideas must
have resulted in the general appli-
cation of animal designs for decora-
tive purposes. That this is the case

to which the Kwakiutl belong are
the seal and the canoe. The seal is not a totem animal, but merely the
symbol of plenty, as no animal of its size furnishes a larger amount of
meat and fat. Therefore the seal feast is also reserved for the highest
tribes of the Kwakiutl. The seal

design is used by each and every
tribe and by each and every clan.
The same is often the case with
the sea-lion design. I have
selected a number of the most
characteristic seal dishes (figs. 28,
29, 30), and also a sea-lion dish

place in the extreme north, begin-
ning at Yakutat. The deep, round forms become flatter and wider
and the carving is less elaborate. The idea underlying the canoe dish
is evidently that a great abundance of food, a canoe load, is to be given
to the guests (figs. 32, 33, 34). The
canoe dish develops into a number
of animal forms, mainly through the
influence of canoe decorations.
The canoe is often painted so as to
represent -a whole animal. This
ornamentation was transferred to

mal forms have necessarily a totemistic origin. I think, however, that
in the course of the development of this culture the preponderance of
animal designs which were originally founded on totemism must have by

VI. THE SPIRITS PRESIDING OVER THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIAL
AND THEIR GIFTS.

It is a common feature of all the legends referred to heretofore that
the supernatural powers which were obtained by the ancestors became
the crest of a clan, and that there is no mention of an immediate rela-
tion between the descendants of the ancestor and his crest. We have
to deal only with legends commemorating the early history of the clan.
They do not indicate that the being which helped the ancestor con-
tinues to protect his descendants.

We have now to deal with another class of legends which relate
entirely to spirits that are still in constant contact with the Indians,
whom they endow with supernatural powers. In order to gain their
help, the youth must prepare himself by fasting and washing, because
only the pure find favor with them, while they kill the impure.
Every young man endeavors to find a protector of this kind. It is
clear that this idea corresponds
exactly to the manitou of the
Algonquin Indians, and that we
have to deal here with the ele-
mentary idea of the acquisition
of a guardian spirit, which has
attained its strongest develop-
ment in America. Its specific
character on the North Pacific
Coast lies in the fact that the

Fig. 31. ard anes e
ie rion Distt: guardian spirit has become he-
W.)S. National Museum. reditary. This is the case

among the northern tribes of British Columbia. It is also the case
among the Kwakiutl and among the Chinook. When the youth pre-
pares to meet a guardian spirit, he does not expect to find any but those
ofhisclan. This is probably the reason for the relatively small number
394 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

of such spirits—for among the Indians of the plains, among whom each
man has his individual spirit, their number is unlimited—and it has
also given occasion for the development of a more elaborate mythology
relating to these spirits.

I shall give a list and brief desecrip-
tions of these spirits and of their gifts.

over the earth). The descriptions of
this being are very indefinite. He is
a warrior and lives in the far north.

other carvings. By obtaining his pro-
tection a youth may acquire one of the following powers. He may
become a—

(1) T’O’X’uit, who is invulnerable and has power over the si’siuL,
which assists him and his friends on war expeditions.

(2) Ma’maq’a. The ma/maq’a
has the power to catch the in-
visible disease spirit, which is
constantly flying through the air
in theform ofaworm. He is able
to throw it into his enemies, who
die from its effects at once.

(3) Hawi‘nalaL (=war dancer),
whoby the help of Wina‘lag“ilis is
insensible to the pain of wounds
and can not be killed, may he be
ever so severely wounded.

Il. Baxbakualanu Xsi’wae (the first one to eat man at the mouth of the
river, i. e., in the north, because the ocean is considered a stream running
northward). He is a cannibal living on the mountains who is always in
pursuitofman. Red smokerises
from his house. His servant (or
wife) is Q’o/minoqas (=the rich
woman), who procures food for
him. He has a female slave,

IV. The ghosts who bestow the power of returning to life after the
person has been killed.

I will not enumerate here, because iv many eases it is difficult to
396 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

describe in what the gift of the spirit consists. This difficulty appears
even in the preceding list of the most important spirits.

Owing to the fact that these spirits are hereditary, their gifts are
always contained in the legend detailing their acquisition by the ances-
tor of a clan. The principal gifts in these tales are the magic har-
poon which insures success in sea-otter hunting; the death bringer
which, when pointed against enemies, kills them; the water of life which
resuscitates the dead; the burning fire which, when pointed against an
object, burns it; and a dance, a song, and cries which are peculiar to
the spirit. The gift of this dance means that the protegé of the
spirit is to perform the same dances which have been shown to him.
In these dances he personates the spirit. He wears his mask and his
ornaments. Thus the dance must be considered a dramatic perform-
ance of the myth relating to the acquisition of the spirit, and shows to
the people that the performer by his visit to the spirit has obtained
his powers and desires. When nowadays a spirit appears to a young
Indian, he gives him the same dance, and the youth also returns from
the initiation filled with the powers and desires of the spirit. He
anthenticates his initiation by his dance in the same way as his mythi-
cal ancestor did.

The obtaining of the magical gifts from these spirits is called
LO‘koala, while the person who has obtained them becomes nau/alak",
supernatural, which is also the quality of the spirit himseif.

The ornaments of all these spirits are described as made of cedar
bark, which is dyed red in the juice of alder bark. They appear to their
devotees only in winter, and therefore the dances are also performed
only in winter. For this reason they may conveniently be called the
winter ceremonial. JI shall revert to this subject more fully later on.

The following legend of the origin of the ha/mats’a (told by the
Na’q’oaqt6q) will make clearer what I have said:

The first of the Awi’k’en6x lived at Wa/waLala. Their chief was
Na/nwagawe. He had four sons who were mountain-goat hunters.
At one time the members of his tribe were disappearing one after
the other and he did not know what became of them. Na/nwaqawe
wanted to eat mountain-goat meat. His sons offered to go out hunt-
ing. These are the names of the sons of Na’nwaqawe: Ta/wix:amayé
and Qoa’qoasililag-ilis, and Ya/qois, and the name of the youngest
was Ni/Lilokue. The young men made themselves ready, and then
Na‘nwaqawe advised them. He said: ‘Do not enter the house the
smoke of which looks like blood, else you will never return home.
It is the house of BaxbakualanuXsi’waé. The smoke of the house
of the goat is white; go there when you see it. Do not go to the
house the smoke of which is grey on one side; it is the house of
the grizzly bear. Else harm will befall you. Now go, my sons, and
mind what I told you.” Ta/‘wix:amayé replied: ‘‘We will try to avoid
misfortune.” The young men left early in the morning. About noon
they discovered the grey smoke of which their father had spoken.
Ta/wix'amayeé spoke: “Now let us see if our father’s advice is good.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. aby

Only take care, dear brothers, that no harm may befall us.” They
went on and soon they met the grizzly bear. They fought with him
and he almost killed them, but finally they overcame the bear and
killed him. The brothers went on. At night they slept. In the morn-
ing Ya‘qois awakened his brothers. They went on for a long time;
then Ta/wix‘amayeé said: “My dear brothers, do you see that smoke
over there? That is what our father meant when he spoke of the
bloody smoke of the house of BaxbakuidlanuXsi/wace. Let us go
there!” They walked on and came to the door of the house. It was
open and the brothers entered. As soon as they came in, a woman
called them. ‘T'a/wix-amayé stepped up to her and the woman said:
“TJ am rooted to the floor. Iwill help you. This house into which you
eame belongs to BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. Now do as I tell you and
take notice of what you will see. Dig a deep hole in that corner of
this house. Then put stones into the fire, and when they are red-hot
put them into the hole.” When the brothers had done so, she con-
tinued: ‘‘Now cover the hole with boards. As soon as Baxbakua-
lanuXsi/waé comes home he will dance, wearing his mask on his
forehead.” As soon as the brothers had finished their work a whis-
tling sound was heard. Then the woman said: **Nowsit down. I will
say that I found food, that he may not see what we have planned.”
BaxbakualanuXsi/wae entered crying “bap.” Then the ho’/Xhok"
and QoaxqoaxuaianuXsi/waeé began to shout. BaxbakualanuXsi/waé
lay on his back. His body was covered all over with mouths. Then
he arose. He became excited and went four times around the house
crying *“‘hap.” Then he went into his bedroom (ma/wiL). As soon
as BaxbakualanuXsiwaé had gone in there, the raven with feathers
on his head which reached down to his waist came out and danced,
going around the fire. The raven went back into the bedroom. Then
QoaxqoaxualanuXsi’waé came out crying “hap, hap, go/u, go!” and
danced around the fire. Then he went back into the bedroom and out
came BaxbakualanuXsi/wae crying, “hap.” He danced around the
fire and went back into his bedroom. Then came the ho/Xhok" crying
“Hap, hap, ho, ho.” He danced around the fire and went back into his
bedroom. Now BaxbakualanuXsi/waé and his four k-i/nqalatala, and
the four q’o/minoqa came out. ‘Hap, hap,” said Baxbakualanu Xsi’wae.
The k-i‘nqalaLala sang and said “hoip,” and sometimes the q’0/minoqa
sang “hai, hai, hai, hai.” BaxbakualanuXsi/waé danced. As soon as
he came to the hole which the men had dug, 'l'a/wix-amayé pulled away
the boards with which it was covered. BaxbakualanuXsi/wae was
looking upward while he was dancing. Then he fell into the hole
upon the red-hot stones. Then they covered the hole up. Now he was
dead. As soon as he died all the k-i/nqalatala and q’0/minoqa died
also. The singers also fainted. While they were unable to see,
Ta‘wix'amayé took off all their ornaments of red cedar bark. He took
the masks and the ha/mats’a pole and the whistles. The old woman
told him what todo, She taught himthesong of BaxbakualanuXsi’ wae,
398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

When Ta/wix-amayé came home, he told his father Na/nwaqawée what
had happened. Na/nwaqawe went at once to see Baxbakualanu Xsi’-
wae’s house. He followed hissons. When they arrived at the house, the
woman who was rooted to the floor gave them food and spoke: ‘My
dear, Na/nwaqawe, you shall dance and keep the ha/mats’a mask, the
raven mask, and the ho/Xhok" mask, and the BaxbakualanuXsi/waé
mask, and all the different kinds of red cedar bark. The q’0’minoqa
shall have red and white cedar bark mixed, and the “ Bear inside the
door of this house” shall have whistles. The no/nutsistalaL shall have
two whistles and red and white cedar bark. You shall also see how
the bedroom (ma/wiL) and the ha/mats’a pole are made. You see it
there, extending through the roof. Here, take the whistles of Bax-
bakualanuXsi/wae.” Thus spoke the woman to Na/nwaqaweé. Now the
woman taught them the songs. She sang the song of the head mask.
This is the song:

1. The ha’mats’a mask of the forehead, the ha’mats’a mask of the whole world, the
pretty mask of that real BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. The ha’mats’a mask of the
forehead, the ha’mats’a mask of the whole word, the pretty mask, a ma ma ma
mé ha me.

2. The ho/Xhok® mask of the forehead, the ho’Xhok" mask of the whole world, the
pretty mask of that real BaxbakualanuXsi/wac. The ho’Xhok" mask of the
forehead, the ho’Xhok" mask of the whole world, the pretty mask, a ma ma ma
mé ha mé.

3. The raven mask of the forehead, etc.

4, The cannibal mask of the forehead, etc.

Then the woman spoke: ‘These are the songs of the ha/mats’a mask
of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. Now listen to the song of q’0’/minoqa. You
shall know that she always goes to get food for BaxbakualanuXsi’wae.
This is the song:

1. Q’o’‘minodqa goes with me around the whole world. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiai.
Q’o/minoqa walks all around the world. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiat.

2. We are afraid of Q’0/minoqa’s body which is covered with blood. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai,
hiai, hiai. Q’o’minoqa is feared by all because her body is terrible. Hiai, hiai,
ai, ai, hiai, hiai.

3. Q’O/minoqa’s cedar bark is tied on to you. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai, hiai. The red
cedar bark of the whole world is making you voracious. Hiai, hiai, ai, ai, hiai,
hiai.

Then the woman spoke again: “That is the song of q’o’/minoqa.
Thus you shall do whenever you initiate a ha’mats’a; then the q’o/mi-
noqa shall carry a corpse on her arms and she shall feed it to the
ha/mats’a.” Then Na/nwaqawé spoke: ‘“ My dear, go and teach us all
you can. Tell us what BaxbakualanuXsi’waé was doing, and tell us
all his names.” Then the woman spoke: ‘ Now listen, these are his
names: Qoa/lamk-aslag-ilis (eating alive on earth), and NoXdana (eat-
ing one man), and Ta/nis (ha’mats’a) and Na/wik" (having eaten one),
and La/wéek" (having swallowed), and LaxLaweék" (swallowing while
standing), and Ho/kwétaso (wishing to be tamed), and xoqamgasa‘lag:i-
lis (swallowing skulls on earth), and x0’/qamé@La‘lag:ilis kaso Bax-
bakualanuXsi/waeé (the real BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, swallowing skulls

on earth), and Qédana (eating many). And these are the names of the

q’o’minoqa: Na/wis (alone on earth), and Lawis k-aso Baxbakualanu-

Xsi/waé (the real BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, standing on earth).

‘ All red shall be the cedar bark of the ha/mats’a, and white and red
shall be the cedar bark of the q’0/minoqa.

“And this is the song of the k*i/nqalaLala.” Then the woman sang:
1. Oh, how nicely you heal your ha/mats’a by your song, by your magical means of

healing, ma mé hama hame.

2. Oh, how nicely you sing your secret song for your ha/mats’a, your magical secret
song, ma mé hama hame,

3. Oh, how nicely you sing your winter ceremonial songs for your ha’mats’a, your
magical winter ceremonial sung, ma mé hama hame.

Then the woman stopped singing and spoke: ‘This is the song of
the k-i/nqalaLala.” Then Na/nwaqawe asked the woman: ‘My dear,
now tell me who you are?” Then she laughed: ‘Do you not know who
lam? Iam your daughter. Therefore I resolved to teach you all the
secrets of the ceremonial of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae.” Then Na/nwaqawe
spoke: “O, my dear! ‘Thanks, that I have seen you again. Now letus
gohome.” Then the woman spoke: ‘It is impossible for me to go home,
because I am rooted to the ground from my backside. I know it is
impossible for me to get up from this floor, but you must come some-
times to see me.” Then Na/nwaqawé replied: ‘Do not say that, child,
for I can not leave you behind.” Na’nwaqawe tried to dig out the
root, but it became the thicker the deeper he dug. Then Na/nwaqawe
gave up digging and thought he would cut the root, but the woman
said: “Do not do that, my dear, else I must die. It is best that you
come sometimes to see ine.” Then Na/‘nwaqawe gave it up and the
woman spoke: ‘Now let me sing the song of the no/nLtsistalaL.”
Then she sang:

1. You frightened everyone by your gifts, magical No’/nitsista dancer, hia, hia, hia, ya.

2. You made everyone feel uneasy by your wild cry, magical No‘nutsista dancer, hia,
hia, hia, ya.

3. You go all around the word, magical No‘nttsista dancer, hia, hia, ya. You drive
away everyone by your gifts, magical No’nLtsista dancer, hia, hia, hia, ya, ya, hia,
ya, ya, hia, hia, hia, ya.

The woman stopped singing and spoke to Na/nwaqawe: ‘As soon as
you get home, give a winter dance. Let Ta/wix-amayé disappear, he
Shall be ha/mats’a; then four days later Qoa/qoasililag‘ilis shall dis-
appear. He shall be q’0’/minoga and get food for that ha/mats’a. Four
days later Nu/Lilogoe shall disappear. He shall be no/nutsistalaL, and
you, Na/nwaqawe, shall be the ‘bear of the door of your house” You
shall have two whistles. And the dancers shall wash every fourth day,
and after they have washed four times every fourth day they shall wash
every sixth day. After they have washed four times every sixth day
they shall wash every eighth day. After they have washed four times
every eighth day they shall wash four times every twelfth day. For
four years the Ha’/mats’a shall do no work, else he will die early. Now

you know the names of all your dancers. Now go home and take the
name of the house of BaxbakualanuXsi/waé. This is its name: ‘Place
of red cedar bark’ (La/qakwatsé). That shail be the name of your
house.” Now Na/nwaqaweé and his sons went home. When they
arrived, he invited his tribe, and after they had eaten Ta/wix-amayé
disappeared. Then Na/nwaqawe’s tribe tried to find him who was to
be a ha/mats’a. Na‘/nwaqawe did all the woman had told him. He
and his sons were the first to celebrate the winter ceremonial. That
is how we know about the dances and the different kinds of cedar bark.
That is the end.

There exist several versions of this important legend, and [I will
record here another which I obtained from the Awi/k’én6x. The
beginning is the same as that of the preceding version; but when they
reach the cannibal’s house, it continues as follows: They met a woman
who was rocking her baby. Opposite her a boy was sitting whose
head was enormously large. The four brothers went near the fire and
sat down on a box. When they did so, the eldest one hurt his leg so
that the blood oozed out of it. Then the boy nudged his mother and
said: ‘‘Mother, I want to lick the blood,” but his mother restrained
him. The boy began to scratch his head and finally commenced licking
the blood notwithstanding his mother’s order. Then the eldest of the
brothers nudged the youngest one and said: ‘Oh, why did we not follow
father’s advice?” The boy coutinued to lick the blood. Then the
eldest brother took his bow and shot an arrow out of the house through
the door. Heasked his youngest brother to go and bring it back. As
soon as he had left the house he ran homeward as fast as he could.
Soon the eldest brother took another arrow and shot it through the
door. He asked his next youngest brother to fetch it, and he also took
the opportunity and escaped. Finally he shot a third arrow, and the
next brother went to fetch it. He also ran homeward as fast as he
could. Then the boy began to ery. The woman asked the only
remaining visitor: ‘Are not your brothers coming back?” and he
replied: ‘‘They only went to fetch my arrows.” Then he shot a fourth
arrow and went himself to fetch it. As soon as he had left the house he
ran homeward. When after some time the brothers did not return, the
woman knew that they had escaped. She stepped out of the house and
called her husband: “ BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, I have allowed our good
dinner to escape.” Baxbakualanu Xsi/waé heard her, although he was far
away. He pursued the boys, erying “ham, ham, ham” (eating, eating,
eating). The four brothers heard him crying, and ran as fast as they
could. The eldest brother carried a whetstone, a comb, and a bottle of
hair oil. When BaxbakualanuXsi/waé had come near them, he threw
his whetstone over his shoulder, and behold! it was transformed into a
mountain which compelled the pursuer to go round about it. But soon
he drew nearer again. Then the young man poured the hair oil over
his shoulder. It was transformed into a lake and the pursuer had to
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. AO1

go around it. But again he came near the flying youths. Then the
young man threw his comb over his shoulder. It was transformed into
an impenetrable thicket. The pursuer had to go all around it, and mean-
while the three brothers came home. Their father let them in and
bolted the door. Soon BaxbakualanuXsi/waé arrived and demanded
admittance. No/aqaua killed a dog, cut it to pieces, and gathered its
blood ina dish. Then he invited BaxbakualanuXsi’wace to come to a
knot hole in the wall of his house and offered him the full dish, saying,
“This is the blood of my sons. Take it and carry it home to your wife.
Come back to-morrow and 1 will feed you.” BaxbakualanuXsi/wae
took the dish and went home. Then Tso/éna, No’aqaua’s wife, made a
deep ditch and built a huge fire. She put stones into it which when
red-hot, she threw into the ditch. Then a skin was stretched near the
fire so as to conceal the ditch. Soon BaxbakualanuXsi/wae and his
wife arrived. He had brought his four children. When they went
into the house, he left his youngest child on the beach to watch the
canoe. There Tso/éna made them sit close to the fire, their backs
turned to the skin which concealed the ditch.

Then BaxbakualanuXsi'waé spoke to No/aqaua: * You know how
everything happened in the beginning of the world. Tell me!”
No’aqaua replied: “TI shall tell you. What shall I tell you about what
happened in the beginning of the world, grandchildren? A cloud was
on the mountain. Soon you will be asleep.” When he had sung so
twice, BaxbakualanuXsi/waé and his whole family were asleep. Then
No/aqaua and Tso/éna drew the back of their seat and they fell into
the ditch. They threw the red-hot stones on top of them. Twice
BaxbakualanuXsi/waé cried “ham, ham!” then he was dead. After
some time they pulled out the bodies. No/aqaua cut them to pieces and
seattered them in all directions, singing: “‘ BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, you
shall pursue man.” They were transformed into mosquitoes.

Here is another legend explaining the initiation of the Oe/alitx, a
subdivision of the Hé/iltsuq.

A woman named Ts’u/mkwalaqas came to the Stikine River, There
she gave birth to a boy who was at once transformed into a stone. It is
now a large mountain at the Stikine. It has aname, but I do not know
it. She had two brothers whose names were Wa’k-as and Do’kwa-
lesala living in a village at Goose Island. She wanted to go to see her
brothers. She went on in her canoe and came to the Skeena River.
There she gave birth to a boy. He was also transformed into stone. It
isnowa large mountain at Skeena River named Kuga. Again she was
with child. She came to Xa/exaés. There she gave birth to a boy,
who was also transformed into stone. It is now a large mountain at
Xa/exaés named Gugasp’its’awé. Again she was with child. She
started in her canoe and came to Da’/yasiowé. There she built a house
of cedar bark. After four days she gave birth to dogs.

Then she used to go digging clams on the beach in front of her house

NAT MUS 95——26
402 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

to get food for her children. Now the young dogs began to grow up.
At night when it was low water, she went down to the beach carrying
a torch, and dug clams. Then she heard a sound like the singing of
many children. Ts’u‘mkwalagas wanted to know who the children
were. She put her digging stick into the ground, took off her cape, and
hung it over the stick. Thus she made it look like a person. Then she
went to see who was singing. She looked through a hole and saw now
that her children were all boys. Then she was watching them and
learned their song, and the song is sung in the Hé/iltsug language:

1. Spread on the floor. Aiha!
2. Down the stream of the world. Aiha!

Now she jumped into the house and said: ‘‘ You have no father and
you are men. I must always work hard to gather food for you.” Only
the youngest one put on his dogskin in time before the woman had
taken the skins and thrown them into the fire. Then the eldest spoke:
“ Don’t let us sit like fools; let us begin to work and help our mother.”
He continued: ‘“‘ What work shall I do for my mother? I shall be a
wood carver.” The second brother said: ‘TI will be her canoe builder.”
The third brother said: ‘‘ What work shall I do for my mother? I will
be the killer of monsters.” Then the dog spoke: “TI will be her dog
and watch that no sickness comes near her. I shall bark when an
invisible spirit approaches.” Now it grew dark. On the following
morning the wood carver carved figures of men and he carved house
posts of different forms—in the shape of all kinds of fish and land ani-
mals. Itis said the posts were as long as a forefinger. He made eight
houses, and then he made one more house. He made it pretty; it had
a front carved in the shape of araven. He built another one with the
front carved in the shape of Wiganx:tx, and he made still another one—
eleven houses in all. And the canoe builder built toy canoes. He
made many.

At night the wood carver took the houses and put them on the ground
on each side of his mother’s house. The large house was in the middle
of that village. Then the canoe builder put his toy canoes in front of
the houses. In the morning Ts’u’mkwalaqas went out. What should
she see but many people and large canoes. Now she was rich. The
wood carver went to the small river near by and made a salmon trap.
He carved salmon of alder wood. Therefore the flesh of the salmon is
red. On the following day he went to look after his salmon trap. He
found one fish in it and gave it to his mother, who cut it open and dried
it. On the following day he went again to look after his salmon trap.
He found eight salmon. He went home, carrying them on his finger,
and gave them to his mother. Then he told his mother to look after
the trap from time to time. The killer of monsters had killed by this
time all the monsters living in the sea near the coast.

Then the brothers said they would go into the woods. In the morn-
ing they went, and the wood carver was the leader. At night they
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 403

rested under a cedar tree. It had not been dark very long when they
heard a sound far away, ‘* Wamo-mo-m0-mo0-wamo-mo-mo0-mo.” That
means: River, river, run, run,run,run. The three brothers were fright-
ened. Now the sound came closer, closer, and closer. They heard it
four times, and every time nearer. They did not know what made the
sound. Then they heard another noise, ‘habit, hi, hi, ahi, hahi, hi, hi,
ahi, hi, hi, bi, ahi, hi, hi, hi.” (This is the ery of Q’o’minogqa.)
They heard the cries four times, and they came nearer every time.
Then the wood carver said: ‘¢I wonder what produces this sound,” and
the canoe builder said: ‘Do not talk too much; are you not afraid?”
Then they heard a sound again, ‘‘hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap, hap.”
(This is the ery of BaxbakualanuXsi’wae.) They heard the sound four
times, and it came nearer every time. Now the sound stopped close to
the place where they were sitting. Then the killer of monsters said:
“Let us go and see what makes the noise.” They all went, and after
a short time they saw a large house. Sparks were coming out of the
roof. They entered, and a man came and told the brothers to sit down
on the right-hand side of the house. Then the speaker of the winter
ceremonial said: ‘‘ Now watch, brothers; now you will get a magic
treasure.” Then the NoO‘nLEmg:ila came in and danced. It was he
who always said “wam6-m6-mo-mo.” As soon as he had finished, the
speaker of the winter ceremonial said: ‘Watch his dance. We call
him No/nLEmg-ila. It shall be your dance.” Next Q’o’/minoqa came
and sang “hahi, hi, hi, hi, ahi, hahi, hi, hi, ahi!”
Then she danced. When she had finished, the speaker of the winter
ceremonial said: ‘It shall be your dance. Her name will be GaLgi-
yots’enox, or invisible spirit. Now take care of that dance.” Thus
spoke the speaker of the winter ceremonial to the brothers: ‘* White
and red is her dancing ornament.” Then the brothers heard far off
the ha/mats’a’s ery “hap, hap.” Now it sounded near the door of the
dancing house. BaxbakualanuXsi/waé came in and cried “hap” in the
doorway of the house, and the people sang for him. This is his song:
1. The whole world speaks of the strength of the mouth of BaxbakualanuXsi’wae.
Hamai, hamamai, hamai, hamamai.

2. Frightened is the whole world of the mouth of BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. Hamai,
hamamai, hamai, hamamai.

3. For four men searched the strength of the mouth of BaxbakualanuXsi’wae.
Hamai, hamamai, hamai, hamamai.

I do not know the song of No/nLEmgcila and Q’6’/minoqa. Now the
brothers came home. Then the wood carver disappeared. He was
taken away by BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. After four days thecanoe builder
disappeared. He was taken away by No/nLEmg‘ila. That is how the
winter dance of O@/alitx originated. That is the end.

I will give still another legend of an initiation by Baxbakualanu Xsi’-
wae. It belongs to the clan G-é’xsEm of the T’Ena/xtax.
The first of the T’Ena’/xtax lived at Lé’/kwadé. Their chief was
404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

La/wag'is. He was in love with a girl. Once upon a time she went up
the river to pick berries, and La/wag‘is followed her. He walked along
the bank of the river, while she had gone up in her canoe. When it grew
dark, he heard cries in the woods. Then he jumped into a pond and
rubbed his body with hemlock branches. He went on. He heard the
cries all the time and bathed in another pond. He walked on. Now
the cries were close to him. He bathed again. Now the cries came
quite close to him. - He bathed the fourth time. As soon as he had
finished, he saw a woman with a large head and matted hair and with
a face which was full of scratches. La/wag:is went up to her and put
his arm around her waist. As soon as he had done so they both fainted.
He recovered first, but he put his arms around her waist only tighter.
Then the woman with the great head recovered and spoke: “I am the
crier of the woods. Now let me go and I will help you to obtain every-
thing easily. I will be your magical helper. You shall obtain easily all
kinds of property.” La‘wag-is only held her more tightly. Then she
spoke again: ‘“T will raise property for you.” Bvt he held her still
tighter. Then she spoke again: ‘“f will give you the water of life. Let
me go.” But he held her still tighter. She spoke again: “Let me go.
Take my name, it shall be yours. You will be Qoa’‘dasgamals. I will
give you the aprou that burns everything.” Then he let her go. She
disappeared at once. She only left the four gifts, which she had given
him, on the ground. Then La/wag-is took his magical treasures. He
went on and tried his apron against the trees of a mountain. Imme-
diately they were burnt, and you can see even now that the mountains
of Ts’a/wate are burnt. Now he was glad. He hid his magical treas-
ures under a cedar tree and went on. He arrived at the village where
his sweetheart was living. She asked him: “Why did you not come
sooner?” He replied: “I lost my way.” That night they went to bed
and played together. After a short time he was poked in the side
through a hole which was in the boards of the house. He arose and
went to look. As soon as he went out his face was covered and he was
led away bya man. He did not dare to speak and to ask, but he knew
that he was led three times up a mountain and three times down. Dur-
ing all this time his face was not uncovered. Then he knew they were
going up.a mountain again, and he heard a ery, “hap, hap, hap; hao, hao;
gad, gad” (the cries of the ha’mats’a, the ho’Xhok", and of the raven.)
Then the man spoke: ‘‘My dear, do not be afraid. I want to give you
magical power. This is my house. I am BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. You
shall see everything in my house.” They entered, and he uncovered the
faceof La’wag'is. ‘“ Nowlook, friend!” said BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. You
shall have my name, Wilgasa/lagilis, and your name shall be Ha/mats’a.
Now watch the dance of the ha/mats’a.” Then he heard the cries, “hap,
hap, hap; hao, hao; gad, gad.” Then the raven that was painted on the
front of the ha/mats’a’s secret room opened its mouth and the ha/mats’a
came out, vomited by the raven. Then he danced. La/wag-is did not
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. A05

see the singers. After the first song the ha’/mats’a went back and the
ho/Xhok" came out and danced. After one dance he went back and the
raven came out and danced. With the next song the ha/mats’a came
out carrying a corpse in his arms, which he ate. When he had eaten it,
he danced again and went back. He had four songs. BaxbakualanuX-
si/waeé spoke: ‘This shall be your ha/mats’a, your name shall be Wil-
gasa/lagilis, and Hamiga‘lagalits’ak" and Naxnawisa‘lag-ilis. Don’t
forget the head masks of the ho’Xhok" and of the raven and the paint-
ing of the secret room. He called La/wag"is to see a ditch that was in
the rear of the house. Then he went and saw it. Something like a
rainbow was standing in the hole. La’wag-is looked down and saw all
kinds of animals and fishes in the hole. BaxbakualanuXsi’/wae spoke:
“This is the cannibal post of the dancing house. This shall be your
magical treasure. Then he taught him his song:

1. You are the great BaxbakualanuXsi/waé, to whom every one looks up, aho, 6, 6, 6,

hem, aem.

2. This is the way of the true BaxbaknalanuXsi’ wae, aho, 6, 6, 6, hem, aem.

3. O, nobody can live before the great BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, abo, 0, 6, 6, hem, aem.
4. Who came out of the woods to me, aho, 0, 6, 0, hem, aém.

Now he had learned the one song and BaxbakualanuXsi’/wae taught
him the second song:

1. You are looking for food, you great magician, mahamai, hama, hamamai; yi
hama ma mai hama.

2. You are looking for men whom you want to eat, great magician; mahamai,
hama, hamamai; yi hama ma mai hama.

3. You tear men’s skins, great magician, mahamai. You try to eat many men, great
magician, mahamai, hama, hamamai; yi hama ma mai hama.

4, Everybody trembles before you, you great magician. You who have been to the
end of the world, mahamai, hama hama mai; yi hama ma mai hama.

After the song BaxbaknalanuXsi/waé called La’wag'is and asked
him: ‘Don’t you want this harpoon shaft? It kills everything. Now
it is yours, and also this red cedar bark and the fire with which you may
burn everything, the water of life, and the quartz for killing your ene-
mies.” Then La/wag-is went home. That is the end.

The following legend belongs to the Nimkish:

There were two friends. One of them had gone into the woods to be
initiated by the spirits of his clan, while the other one was not yet pre-
pared to meet these spirits. Nevertheless he went to search for his
friend and after four days he found him. When he returned, his father
asked him where he had been, and he told him that he had found his
friend who was being instructed by thespirits. Then his father struck
him, saying: ‘‘Do you not know that it is forbidden? I shall be killed
on account of you.” Then the youth became sad. At night he put on
his ornaments, which were made of abalone shells, and went into the
woods. He went up the river and washed with hemlock branches.
The following morning he went on, and the next day he washed again.
Then he heard the voice of BaxbakualanuXsi/waé. At the end of the
406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

fourth day he came to a precipice and lay down at its base to rest.
Early in the morning he saw the rock open and out came Baxba-
kualanuXsi/wae. He hid, and the spirit flew away over his head. His
body was all covered with red cedar bark. Four days the boy stayed
there. On the fifth morning when BaxbakualanuXsi’/wae came out
again, he followed him, and saw how he took off his cedar bark orna-
ments on the bank of a pond and went to swim in it. When he dived,
the youth jumped forward and put on the cedar bark ornaments. Now
the spirit emerged. When he saw the boy decked with his cedar bark
ornaments, he said: ‘You have done well to take my ornaments. Now
I can do you no harm.” He took him along to his home inside the
rock. There he asked him: ‘What do you want to have? Do you
want this harpoon? Do you want the water of life? Do you want the
death-bringer? Do you want my ha/matsa?” He gave him all of
these. The youth stayed with him for four days. Then he was able
to fly. Then BaxbakualanuXsi/waé instructed him to fly to a place
where his father was accustomed to fetch water for cooking. Soon his
younger brother came, and when he saw him, he discovered that he
had been away a long time. What had seemed to him four days were
actually four years. Heasked the young boy: “ How is father? Iam
your elder brother. Go and ask father to clean his house.” The boy
went back and told his father, who beat him for speaking of his dead
son. Then the boy ran back and complained to his brother that his
father had beaten him for carrying the message. The elder brother
sent him back to the house, asking him to repeat his request. The boy
obeyed and when his father had heard the message again, he went out
to see by himself. As soon as his eldest son saw him he grew excited.
He flew across the river to the graveyard, tore corpses out of their
coffins and devoured them. Then he flew into his father’s house and
bit everyone whom he saw.

There are a number of tales referring to the acquisition of the
ho/Xhok". The Naq6/mg-ilisala have the following legend on this
subject:!

A number of women went to theisland Yu’Lé to dig fern roots. They
put some dried whale meat over the fire and a red-breasted owl came
and picked up some of it. It is said that there are many red-breasted
owls there. Then all of a sudden came the ho/Xhok" and alighted on
top of atree. He came downward, pecking the tree. He came down
to the bottom of the tree, but it was hard on his beak. Now he walked
up to the women. He covered his nose and was transformed into a
man. He reached a woman who put some dry whale on the fire. She
laid a mat before him and put the whale meat on it. The ho/Xhok"
said: “J do not eat whale meat, I eat only man’s brain.” So saying, he
pecked the woman’s head, broke her skull, and ate the brain. One of
the women had hidden when he came down. She went home and told
the tale. Then the Naqé/mg-ilisala resolved to make war upon the
ho’/Xhok".. Q0o/mg:ustals and Waxalalaa took the blood of a woman

| Appendix page 680.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. AQT

and washed themselves. Then they made war on the ho’/Xhok". Now
they went to where the women had been. They put whale meat on the
fire. At once many owls came there and the ho’/Xhok" alighted on
the tree. Now he came downward, pecking the tree. When he came
to the foot of the tree, he jumped. His beak stuck in a crack of the
tree. Then Qo’mg-ustals and Waxalalaa ran up to him and broke off
his nose and pushed him into the fire. He was dead. That is the end.

The following tradition of the Awi/k’enox referring to the ho/Xhok#
is of interest because it indicates the ceremonial or dance performed
by every novice initiated by this being:

A young man named Q”’o/mkilig‘a went into the woods to fetch cedar
bark. There the ho/Xhok" scented him. He found that the youth was
clean, and therefore rushed down upon him in order to abduct him.
When Q’-o/mkilig-a heard the spirit coming, he trembled with fear. He
hoped to master his fears by smoking, but he failed. He fainted and
lay like one dead. The ho/Xhok" came down to him and imbued him
with his powers.

When the youth did not return, his friends went into the woods to
search for him. They found him lying in a deep swoon. They sprin-
kled him with cold water, but he did not awake. They carried him
back to the village. When his father saw him, his heart was sad. But
soon he noticed that he was still alive. He called a shaman and bade
him heal his son. The shaman ordered the house to be swept and the
floor to be strewn with sand. He took the youth into the woods and
stayed there for four days. Then he returned. After four days more
Q’o’mkilig-a also returned. He had received the name QoaLqoa’oé.

He sang of the ho/Xhok", and suddenly he jumped up in order to
devour his father, who was sitting on the opposite side of the fire. He
had the cedar-bark ornaments of the ha/mats’a around his neck and head.
His head ring slid down and fell right over his mouth, so that instead
of biting his father he bit a piece out of hisring. His grandfather took
a large black blanket which he wound around the youth’s head. He
tore it with his teeth. Then the people wound a rope over his mouth; he
tore it. Nobody was able to subdue him. All the people fled out of
the door for fear. They heard him singing in the house and looked
through the chinks and through the knot holes to see what he was
doing. They saw him climbing the posts and pushing the roof boards
aside. He wanted to pursue the people. Then they stationed two
men at the doors, and others held the roof dewn so that he should not
escape. Others entered and threw a bearskin over him. But he crept
about in the house and his skin was so slippery that nobody could
hold him. In the evening he quieted down and lay so still that the
people thought he might be asleep. They made a jacket of cedar bark
in which they tried to catch him. But as soon as they approached he
jumped up and ran out of the house. On the island Nalkuitxoi’as there
were a number of women engaged splitting salmon. He scented them
and jumped into the water to devour them. They escaped in their
canoe when they saw him coming.
408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

At last QoaLqoa‘oe recovered his senses. He spoke to his father:
‘‘When I grow excited again, do not try to defend yourself, I shall do
you no harm.” After a short time he fell again into a state of ecstasy.
He lay flat on the floor, his face downward. ‘The people threw a net
made of cedar bark over him, in order to catch him. Sometimes they
succeeded in placing a foot on his neck, but they were unable to hold
him, not even by winding his long hair around their hands. He
escaped, and nobody knew what had become of him. He ran about in
the woods and when he came back to the village he bit whomsoever he
met. When he recovered his senses, he asked his father to boil oulachon
oil and to give it to him as soon as he fell into a renewed ecstasy, as
this would restore his senses. Once when he was excited, he scented
the mussels in a canoe which was approaching the village, but which
was still far away. He ran down to the beach and as soon as the canoe
landed he ate all the mussels that were in it. Then he became quiet.

Another group of initiating spirits are the ghosts; their protégés
are the ghost dancers. Following is a legend of the L’a’/sq’enox regard-
ing the origin of the ghost dance:!

Goa’xLa and his children lived in a village in heaven. His sons
were Qo/masdox, the eldest one, Hai’aqoalaL, the next, No/‘lak-as the
following, and A/nqgolak-as. His rival was TsilqoaloLEla. He had
three sons, Sepa’/xis and YaqanLamayé and G:e/xdEn. Then Tsi/lqoalo-
LEla wanted to come down to our world. He made a copper ladder
on which he was going to climb down with his children. His rival
wanted him to pay for it.(?) Now Goa/xta heard what Tsi/lqoaloLEla
had said. Then he walked and walked for four days. All of a sudden,
he saw a mountain growing up from this our world reaching up to the
sky. Then he went home and told his sons. They got ready and came
to the place where he had been before. After a little while they saw
the mountain rising up again. As soon as it reached heaven Goa/xLa
said to his sons: *‘I shall not follow you. Go now and call your tribe
the Pé’pawiLenox. You shall take my dancing implements.” Thus
he spoke to his sons. Then Qo’/masdox and Hai‘aqoalaL and No‘lak-as
and also A/nqolak-as came down to Raspberry Beach. Then they went
on looking for a river. They were walking in the woods and came to
Cape Cook. There they found a pole at the point of Cape Cook. Then
Qo/masd6x and Hai/agoalaL went back, keeping close to the beach.
They came to Ots’0/lis and went to the head of the bay. There they
saw smoke. They came up to it and saw a house, which they entered.
There were two women who were roasting clams. Then Q0/masd6x
and Hai/aqoalaL asked the women: ‘“‘ Where do you come from?” ‘The
women replied: ‘We came from the upper world and we have no hus-
bands.” Then Qo/masd6x said, ‘‘*We have no wives. How did you
come down?” Then Wi’yoleneqa, one of the women, spoke: ‘These
geese brought us down here and we came to be your wives.” ‘The
brothers were glad on hearing this and they went home with their

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 409

wives, Wi/yolenega and Wiyotasoguilak". When they came to Rasp-
berry Beach, the women were with child. They gave birth to boys,
and Qo/masd6x gave his son the name La‘qoasqEm. The boys grew
up quickly. One day the children were playing at the river at one
end of Raspberry Beach. Then La‘qoasqEm fainted on that side of
the river. The other boy went back to tell Qo’masd6ox. He came at
once to look after his son, and really, he was dead. He buried him
immediately. In the evening the boy returned to life, but what could
he do? He was inside the coffin box. At night he heard people talk-
ing to each other. Then he was able to open the cover of the box.
Right away he was called and they went to a house in which beating
of boards was heard. Three ghosts were asked to take care of the
boy. Then they led him into the dancing house, but they did not go
to the rear of the house. They sat in the middle of the right hand
side. Now they spoke to La/qoasqem: ‘Now take care, remember
what you see and the songs which you will hear. Don’t eat of the
food they offer you.” There was a chief standing in the house holding
a rattle. His name was Ha‘mamaxayals. He was chief of all the
ghosts. He said, “Come, let my boy go to the rear of the house.”
But the three ghosts replied, “He isalive.” They finished their dance.
The boy felt uneasy. Then Ha’mamaxayals said: ‘‘Take care, my
tribe. We will take that little boy to his house.” Then all the ghosts
took some moss and pat it on their heads. Then the little boy also
put some moss on his head. At once he sat on the ground of our own
world. A shaman named Hé/Lilalag-ilis was told to take some urine to
wash the people. Then all the ghosts cried ‘hamama’” where he was
sitting. Qd/masd6x and his wife were eating when they heard the
sound, “hamama/, hamama’.” He ran out of his house to look, and
there he saw his son sitting on the ground. He called his wife,
“Come.” His wife came to see and recognized her own son. Then
La/qoasqEm called his father, ‘Go and take some urine to sprinkle
your people with.” Qo/masd6x brought his chamber. Then the
whole tribe came. But the ghosts opened their mouths. As soon
as a person passed their mouths while they were saying “hamama’”
he died. Then La/qoasqem shouted, “Sprinkle some urine on the
people.” As soon as it was done all those who had been dead resur-
rected. Then he entered his father’s house and with him came the
noise of the ghosts. The boy was singing their song and the tribe
learned it from him. Thus they learned the song of the ghosts. Now
listen to the song of the boy! His name was Neénuaxstals, now that
he was ghost dancer. No other kind of dance and carving came to
him. This is his song:
1. Ya xamamé, ya xamameé, ya xamame ya.
Now ghosts, go all to that upper world!
2, Ya xamamé, ya xamame, ya xamame ya.
For great is your wealth in the ground, ghosts!
3. Ya xamameé, ya xamameé, ya xamame ya.
For great is your fire and many your hot stones, ghosts!
410 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The origin of the sunrise dance is given as follows:

Kuexala/lag-ilis and his tribe, the first of the G-o’p’enox, were living
at G-e/damis. At that time it was always dark and it never grew day-
light. The first G:0’p’enox were sad. Then Nag:éisilakua invited his
tribe. As soon as they had all assembled in the chief’s house he spoke:
“G-o/p’enox! I did not invite you to eat. I will talk about our world.
It is not good that it never gets daylight. Now deliberate, councilors
of the G:0/p’endx, how we can obtain the daylight for our world. That
is what I wanted to say.” He stopped speaking and an old man named
Yaqantayig:ilak", the father of Kuéxala‘lag-ilis, said: ‘‘ Ya, G-0’p’énox,
let us try to find where Nénalaats’éqa is living and let us go to her.
Then another old man said: ‘ My tribe, she is living at Xua’tis; and it
is said that she keeps the sun in her box. Let us go and make war
upon the Koskimo, for Nénalaats’eqa is of their tribe. Let us take
away the daylight that she is keeping in her box.” With this the old
man stopped speaking. Then Kuéxala‘lag-ilis, who had magical powers,
said: ‘My tribe, you all know I am Kuéxala‘lag:ilis; I have magical
powers. Do not make war upon the Koskimo, for I will go to Néna-
laatvéqa with my friend Ts’eqaxsdo‘kuilak". Now, make yourself
ready, my friend! Let us go to Xua/tis. But you, my tribe, take care
lest misfortune should befall me.” Then all the people said: ‘* We
are gladdened after having been downcast, because you have magical
powers and therefore you always succeed in your undertakings.” Now
Kuéxalalagilis and Ts’eqaxsdo/kuilak" started. The former said to
his friend: ‘‘ We will not go right to Xua/tis. I will go to the woods and
try to find a really supernatural power. Do not get out of patience
if you have to wait for me for a long time, else we shall not con-
quer Nénalaats’éqa. Hide here and do not let anyone see you.” Then
he left the canoe and went into the woods at night. After a short time
he discovered the squirrel. Kuéxala/lag-ilis. spoke to him and asked:
“What are you doing here, friend?” The squirrel replied: ‘Iam pick-
ing crab apples.” He asked in his turn: “What are you doing here?”
Kuéxala/lag‘ilis replied: ‘+I am trying to bathe in that lake, that I may
obtain possession of the box in which is our sun, and which Néna-
laats’eqa is keeping.” The squirrel said: ‘* Do you not know how to
transform yourself into a baby and enter Nénalaats’eqa’s womb?
Then, when you are born, you must cry for the box.” Then Kuexa-
la‘lag-ilis was glad to have the advice of his friend the squirrel. He
went to his canoe and told his friend: “You may go home. fam not
going with you, and do not worry if I stay away long.” He pushed
the canoe into the water and Ts’éqaxsdo/kuilak" paddled home to
G-é/damis. He told the G:6’p’endx what had happened.

Then Kuéxala‘lagilis walked until he saw the village at Xua/tis.
There he saw Neénalaats’éqa sitting in her house, eating salmon.
Then he transformed himself into a baby and entered her womb. She
vomited at once. Her belly swelled rapidly and after four days she

gave birth to a boy. When he was one day old, he was able to walk,
and the following day he began to talk. When the child was four days
old, it began to cry for the box. Then Nénalaats’éqa gave it to the
boy. He stopped crying at once. On the following day the child went
playing in the canoe. Then Nénalaats’éqa told her speaker to push
the hunting canoe into the water. The boy went aboard the canoe and
then he began again to ery for the box. His mother told her speakers
to put the box into the canoe. Then the boy stopped crying. He
pushed off the canoe and went far away from the shore with the tide.
Then an old man said to Nénalaats’eéqa: ‘* What have you been doing?
Is that the box in which the day is that is now in the bow of the canoe
of that child? Do you not know him? That is Kuéxala/lag-ilis.”
Thus spoke the old man. As soon as Kuéxala/lag-ilis had rounded
the point, he opened the box. Then he took out the sun and removed
his si/siuL mask. It grew light at once. The sun spoke: “O, friend!
do not keep me! Let me go to the upper world, for now I will try
to benefit our world. It will be day now. You have my si’siun
mask.” Thus spoke the sun. Then Kuéxala/lag:ilis replied: ‘Do not
go just yet, friend! You may go to the upper world when we arrive
among my own tribe at G-é/damis. They all will praise you.” Then
he paddled home. The sun said: ‘My friend! treat my si/siuL mask
well. You may show it during the winter dance, and also the sunrise
mask. Its name shall be EXts’umatusHlag-ilis (abalone shell from
one end of the world to the other). That is all.” Thus spoke the sun
and bid farewell to Kuéxala‘lag-ilis. Then he went to the upper world.

In this manner the G:0’p’enéx obtained the sunrise mask (na/xnak-a-
qEmL) and its red cedar bark. It was inside the box. That is the end.
(See figs, 129-133, p. 484.)

The Ma’‘trm ceremonial derives its origin from the following legends
of the Nimkish:

At Papék-in, above Nimkish Lake, lived a young man named O/mea-
LEmaée. He was always playing with other children, One night he was
very hungry. He took salmon roe out of a box and roasted it. When
the roe burst, some of it jumped against the neck of the boy’s father,
who was sitting near the fire warming his back. He grew angry and
struck Ma’‘teEm with a stick. The boy became sad and went into the
woods. After walking a long time he came to a place where there was
a jam of driftwood in the river. He wanted to die, and he jumped into
the water above the jam, but he came up again below, none the worse
for his long dive. He came to a second jam and jumped into the river
above it, but he came up below hale and well. Then he arrived at a
steep cliff. He climbed up and flung himself down the precipice, but
he did not hurt himself. He went on and soon he arrived ata mountain
which was resplendent with light. It was the cliff Na/oalakoa. There
it was raining quartz all the time. He took up four erystals and placed
them in a row on the medial line of his head. He climbed the moun-
412 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

tain and his whole body was covered with crystal. Soon he became
aware that with the crystal he had attained the power of flying. Then
he flew all through the world. He believed that he had been absent
for four days, but in reality there had been as many years. Finally he
returned to his village. His clan happened to be at Ne’nélk-as fishing
on the lake by the light of torches.

Then he appeared in the shape of a white eagle and quartz was rain-
ing down where he was seen. He alighted on a tree and sang—

“on oN Oo

sy as ae oe eld ere Sa ee eee |
S22 SS eee ee eae 2S SS
Ha-a ha a ha a ha ha-a na a, Gy Bh née.

Then the people knew that he had returned and that he had obtained
magical power from Ma/teEm. They bathed and went down to the shore,
each carrying a staff to which a crystal had been fastened. But
O/meaLEmaé, whose name was now Ma‘tEm, smelled them and did not
allow himself to be caught. When it grew dark, he was soaring over
thehouses. In vain the people tried to catch him. One of his old play-
mates was very anxious to catch him. He made a loop of cedar bark
rope and succeeded in throwing it over the bird’s head. The latter
continued soaring about. The youth, who now received the name
Ma’‘taanoe, followed him. He asked the people to sweep the house
and to place a plank on the roof. When they had done so, Ma‘tEm
alighted on the plank. Three times he flew up again, but the fourth
time he came down into the house, accompanied by Ma‘taanoe.

Later on Ma/trkm went out with his slaves to cut wood. His canoe
capsized and he descended to Bé’benaqaua. There he saw many
dances and he received the 10]0/LalaL, the ghost dance, and the name
Lo/LEmae.

I obtained another version of this tale from a Kwakiutl, although
the tale belongs also to the Nimkish:

A youth was in the habit of spending his time with his sweetheart
and notwithstanding the urgent appeals of his mother he refused to
marry. Late one night he came home and asked his mother to prepare
food for him. She was angry and said: ‘‘Go back to the place where
you came from and get your-feed there. I shall not give you any-
thing.” Then the youth was sad. He lay down and remained in bed
four days without partaking of any food. His mother began to worry
and asked him to rise, but he did not listen. Then she called the
youth’s sweetheart to call him, but he did not listen to her either. At
last, after four days, he arose and went into the woods without knowing
where he went. He had lost his senses. Hecametoa lake. There he
threw off his clothing and swam and dived in the lake. He remained
under water for along time. When he came up again, a totem pole
rose with him. He said, “I do not want you,” and thought, ‘I will go
-THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 413

on.” After some time he came to another lake. Again he swam and
dived. When he came up, a seal harpoon came up with him, but he
did not want to have it. He was trying to find the bird Ma’/tem. He
came to athird and toa fourth pond, and after having bathed he knew
that he would find the bird. He put on his blanket and went on.
Soon he saw the bird, which was flying ahead of him. He threw off
his blanket in order to be able to follow him more rapidly. Suddenly
the bird turned and called, ‘‘ What do you want of me?” The youth
replied, ‘‘My mother maltreated me. Now I came to find a magical
treasure.” The bird retorted: ‘Do you see you mountain? That is my
abode. Let us climb it!” He flew ahead and the youth followed him.
When they had arrived at Ma‘tEm’s house, the bird gave him quartz
and other things, the water of life, the fire of death, and the seal har-
poon. He put the quartz crystals into the youth’s joints and thus he
obtained the powerof flying. He sent him to the mountain Ts’ilk-impae
(feathers on top) in the far north, in order to get eagle down for his
dances. The youth started on his journey. When he approached the
mountain, it was snowing, hailing, and raining. ‘The people who lived
near the mountain keep great fires burning in order to see and to catch
everyone who comes to the mountain wanting to get eagle down. But
by the help of the quartz the youth passed them without being seen.
He gathered the eagle down, and thus obtained the power of assuming
the shape of a bird. Then he returned to his own village in the shape
of a bird. When his younger brother saw the bird approaching, he
laid a snare to catch it. The bird put the snare over its own neck and
resumed his human shape. He sent word to his father, asking him to
clean his house. . When this was done, he came home in the evening
and danced as Ma/tEm. On the following morning the bird Ma/tmm
brought a totem pole and threw it down in front of the youth’s house.

The Mé‘ina is a legend which belonged originally to the Hé/iltsuq
and Awi’k’en6ox. I obtained the following tale from the Awi’/k’én6x
regarding its origin:

A young man named Mé@/iLa went ten times inside of one year up to the
Sky. On his first visit he found a gull, which he brought down. On his
second visit he found a puffin (?); on his third visit the salmon berries,
then a diver (a bird) and the bird xé/xexe. After his sixth visit he
brought the bird atE/mkuli. But when he had gone up the tenth time
he did not return again. His mother, Léelaiaqs, and his father,
(Q’omxto-is, mourned for him. Finally they fell asleep. His mother
thought that in her dream she saw a beautiful house, but on awaking
she recognized that what she believed to have been a dream was real.
The house was near by, and her son M@‘ita was sitting in front of it.
She awakened her husband that he might see him. They jumped up
and ran toward the house. But it retreated from them, and finally they
saw that it was in reality up in heaven. Then they sat down and cried,
singing “Our son is in heaven playing with Nusni/sElis (the moon).

Never will he return to us.” When they
were thus singing, their niece passed by
them, and they told her that they had
seen M@‘iLa playing in front of the moon’s
house. Their niece said, ‘‘ Let us make
him appear in our dances.” The parents
of the boy agreed and let their niece
(Yoqomé’tsEmqa perform the Mé/ita
dance. They gave her his name.

In a number of cases the dance or the
powers obtained by the ancestor are also
represented onthe totemearvings. Iwill
give a few examples of this kind:

There werethefirstof the Qoé’/xsot’énox
at Hé’qams. Lalilitax came to be their
chief. Now, he said he wanted to go to
the river of Ga’yux to see if the sockey-
salmon went up the river. He went far
up, but did not find a single salmon.
Then he forgot why he had gone up the
river. Hefelt dizzy. Allofasudden he
saw a pretty man sitting ona stone. His
face was like that ofa bird. The man did
not see La‘lilitax. The latter went up
to him and stood behind him while the
other was not turning hishead. He said,
‘‘Friend, what are you doing here?”
Now the man turned his head and spoke:
“Thank you, friend, that you came so
that I could see you. Iam the one who
thunders from the one end to the other
end of the world.” wLa/‘liliLax replied:
‘‘Q, master, I came here for your sake.
Now give me a magic treasure.” Then
the man spoke: ‘‘ Make a house and in-
vite all the tribes.” He showed him the
carving of the thunder bird, with two
spread legs. They say it was as long as
a forefinger. The man spoke: ‘“ Its legs
are the door of the house. This is my
ornament of red cedar bark around its
head. The heads on it were given tome
by my father that I should eat them.
This image of a man you shall place in
the rear of your house. It is the image
of my father, (Plate 22.) In the coming

Then the man disappeared. La/lili-

give him food, but he did not take
it. His tribe thought that he had

he sang his secret song. He was glad that he had received this house,
because all had come what the man had told him. ‘This is the secret
song of La’liliLax:

My name will be: property drifting toward me on account of my property-bringer.
Yao, yao, yao, ha, yao, ha, yao.

The coppers all drift to me on account of the copperbringer. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, oh, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, oh, oh.'

Then La‘lilitax told his tribe to invite all
the tribes. The speakers went out between
the legs of the thunder bird, which formed the
door of the house, and he gave a winter cere-
monial. He was the thunder dancer. He
owned the red cedar bark of the thunder
bird and his name was Ya/qaLEnlis. All
the tribes who were invited came, and he
gave away sea-otter blankets, lynx skins,
bear skins, marten skins, mink skins, and all
kinds of skins. His clan were the G:e/xsEm

Ye/qug:alag-ilis invited all the tribes to a feast which he gave with what
he had received from his father-in-law; the coppers, canoes, slaves, boxes,
covers, and names. Now Yé’qug-alagvilis took the name La/liliLax and
the name for the winter ceremonial that belongs to it. That is the end.

The following legend belongs to the
subdivision Mé/Emaqaaé of the Naqo’-
mgvilisala and explains the post shown
in fig. 36 (see also pp. 332 and 376):

grave, and a sun was painted on it.
After four days it began to thunder. Lé‘laxa thundered. He came
down to the beach early in the morning in the shape of the thunder bird.
He took off his mask, and they recognized Lé/laxa. Then he showed his
magical treasures; the thunderbird mask, the two-face mask, and the
morning ask. He wasma/maqa. He threw the worm against his ene-
mies (see p.485). He was ts’é/kois'

The clan »’a/ms’amtElaL of the

qilak" was going to make a flood. She and her sister finished closing
the chinks and holes of the house. Qa/niqilak" spoke: ‘Is it true that

tell the thunder bird what he had heard. Now the thunder bird arose
and went into his house. He put on his eagle dress and came out again.

VII. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TRIBE DURING THE SEASON OF
THE WINTER CEREMONIAL.

In.the preceding chapter I have described a number of spirits which
appear to the Indians and are supposed to bestow supernatural powers
upon them. From the legends which I have told, it appears that these
spirits appeared first to the ancestors of the clan; and I have stated
that the same spirits continue to appear to the descendants of these
mythical ancestors. The number of spirits is limited, and the same one
appeared to ancestors of various clans of different tribes. But in these
cases he gave each of his protégés his powers in a slightly different
form. In fact each name of the nobility (as described on p. 338) has a
separate tradition of the acquisition of supernatural powers, and these
have descended upon the bearers of the name. Asindicated in some of
the traditions, the spirits give new names tothe men to whom they appear,
but these names are in use only during the time when the spirits dwell
among the Indians—that is, in winter. Therefore, from the moment
when the spirits are supposed to be present, all the summer names are
dropped, and the members of the nobility take their winter names.

It is clear that with the change of name the whole social structure,
which is based on the names, must break down. Instead of being
grouped in clans, the Indians are now grouped according to the spirits
which have initiated them. All those who are protected by Baxbaku-
alanuXsi/wae form one group; those who stand under Wina’lag-ilis
form another group, ete., and in these groups divisions are made
according to the ceremonies or dances bestowed upon the person.

Thus,-at the time of the beginning of the winter ceremonial the
social system is completely changed. The period when the clan sys-
tem is in force is called ba’xus, which term also designates those
who have not been initiated by any spirit, and might be translated
“profane.” The period of the winter ceremonial is called ts’e’ts’aeqa,
the secrets, which term designates also the ceremonial itself. It is
also called ts’e’qa (singular of ts’e’ts’aeqa); aik’e/gala (making the
heart good); and g*a/xaxaak" (brought down from above). The In-
dians express this alternating of seasons by saying that in summer
the ba’xus is on top, the ts’e’ts’aeqa below, and vice versa in winter.

During this period the place of the clans is taken by a number of
societies, namely, the groups of all those individuals upon whom the
same or almost the same power or secret has been bestowed by one of
the spirits. Thus the ha/mats’a, nu/Lmat, bear dancers, etc., form each
one society, which consists of a limited number of names, because the

°
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 419

members of the society derive each their membership from the initia-
tion of one of the ancestors of the nobility.
each only one representative at a time.

together, as will be presently described.

It follows from these facts that a new member of a society can be
admitted only when another one is dropped, whose place he then takes.
The custom is analogous to the transfer of a position in the nobility to
a youth; the old member transfers his rights to a young man and drops
out of the ranks of the society.

The dancers (or societies) are arranged in two principal groups, whose
names among the Kwakiutl proper are the seals (mé/émqoat) and the
que/qutsa. The former embrace a number of dancers and societies
of dancers—the ha/matsa, ha/mshamtsEs, k-inqalaLala, no/ntsistalaL,
qoe/qoasElaL, q’0/minoga, na‘ne, nu/Lmat. They are the highest in
rank. All the others are qué/qutsa. These are subdivided in smaller
groups according to age and sex, as follows:

These ancestors have

bo

The number of these societies has undergone frequent changes, but
the Maa’mx’éndx, D’0/d’opa, W’e/L’éxEn, and Qoe/qoim have always
remained. The present societies of the women are quite new, as is
shown by their names—hens and cows. The former were called until
about twenty years ago wa/xwaxoli.

The La/Lasiqoala are divided in the following way: The group cor-
responding to the seal group is called q’a/q’anas (a small black shell-
fish). They embrace the ha/mats’a, ma/maq’a, t?0/x’uit (0/lala), hai’a-
lik-ila, ts’e/koise, sé/lies, ts’é’koa’ta’, yiya’‘Lalat.

The societies corresponding to the qué/qutsa divisions are the
following:

Males. Females.

x'il/x'itpa (puffins), little boys.

Laa‘/1k'o (mallard ducks), boys.

3. Kv’ik’iné/La (sea anemones), sick and
lame people.

4, Gagimola (halibut hooks), young
chiefs.

5. Ne/ntsae (red cod), third-class chiefs.

6. L’é/L’axan (sea lions), men about 30
years old.

420 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The Na’‘q’oaqt6q are divided as follows: The group corresponding to
the seals are called wu’‘n’awunx‘is, the troublesome ones. They em-
brace hamats’a, bear, and ma/maq’a. I have not a complete list of the
subdivisions of the quée/qutsa.

L’0’L’Epana (cormorants) are the chiefs, ésElalittsawé qoayi’m (the
whales for whom one waits), are the young men, ts’e’ts’eg-inaqa (gulls),
the elder boys.

The group corresponding to the seal group is called among the
Koskimo ts’E’qolag'ilis, and embraces wolves and ha/mats’a. The chiefs
among this tribe are called t’0/topa (rock-cods), and the higher chiefs
na/né (bears). The middle-aged men are called gué’guso (pigs).

The que’‘qutsa groups of all these tribes embrace those individuals
who, for the time being, are not possessed by the spirits. A member
of the qué/qutsa may at any time be initiated by a new spirit and then
he or she leaves their ranks. Or he may become possessed of his
spirit and show his dance or ceremony. Then he is for the time being
not considered as one of the que’qutsa, but simply as one of these
dancers. Therefore the que/qutsa correspond very nearly to the group
of people who have resigned their places in favor of younger ones, as
these also may reenter the ranks of the nobility by marEy ie and thus
obtaining a new name.

Theseal society are subdivided in two groups: The la/xsa(goneinto the
house), those who have gone through the house of BaxbakualanuXsi/waé
and learned all his secrets, and the wi’xsa (not gone into the house),
those who have only ‘‘leaned against its walls.” All the dancers who
are instructed by BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, the ha/mats’a, ha’/mshamtskEs,
BaxbakualanuXsi’wae’s grizzly bear, ki/nqalaLala and q’0/minodqa
belong to the la’xsa; the others are wi’xsa.

Each dance (lé/da) has two names belonging to it—the dance name
(lélaenexLii/ya) and the que’qutsa name (que/tsEXxLa/ya) which latter
the individual assumes when giving up his dance in favor of a younger
man, or which he has when not performing his dance or ceremony.

The two groups, the seals and the qué’qutsa, and the corresponding
ones among the other tribes, are hostile to one another. The seals
when excited attack and torment the que’qutsa; the latter, on the other
hand, tease and torment the members of the seal society. While most
of the dancers join during the greater part of the ts’é’ts’aéqa season
the que/qutsa and perform their dances only at certain occasions, the
members of the seal society, particularly the highest ones, the ha’mats’a,
must stay with their society, and even when they intend to give up
their dance the qué/qutsa try to prevent them by all possible means.

It will be noticed that most of the subdivisions of the que/qutsa
have animal names. For this the Indians give the explanation that
the ceremonial was instituted at the time when men had still the form
of animals; before the transformer had put everything into its pres-
ent shape. The present ceremonial is a repetition of the ceremonial
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 421

performed by the man animals (nu’/xnémis) or, aS we may say, a drama-
tization of the myth. Therefore the people who do not represent spirits,
represent these animals.

As might be supposed from the laws governing the clan system, the
“dance” is principally acquired through marriage. Together with
the house, the carvings, and names of the father-in-law, the young man
obtains his dance name and que/qutsa name, but not for his own use.
They are given to his successor (Lawu’/Iqame), who is initiated in the
prescribed way and then performs the ceremony. But the son-in-law
of the former owner controls the dance. It can be shown only with
his consent, and, when another man marries his daughter, he may take
it away from his successor and give it to this person, who then owns
and controls it.

By means of marriages with the Awi‘/k’enox and He/iltsuq the num-
ber of dances of the Kwakiutl has been materially increased.

T can now describe the manner in which these privileges which are
obtained by marriage are transferred by a man to his son-in-law. I
stated previously (p.
359) that according
to the number of
children of the couple

interest. As the time approaches when this money must be returned, the
father-in-law calls in all his outstanding debts and gathers all his prop-
erty, until he has a large stock of food, blankets, boxes, dishes, spoons,
kettles, bracelets, coppers, and the ceremonial box lids (g‘I/sExstala or
koqgétaya’no). These are old lids of boxes, some evidently of very great
age. Their shape is the same as that of the lids whichare still in use, but
the front part is much higherand painted with designs representing faces
and set with sea-otter teeth (fig. 41). The bracelets are tied to sticks, ten
to each stick; besides the large coppers, small ones, about an inch or two
in length, areused. Four of these are tied together and to the end of a
stick. When the father-in-law has collected the necessary amount of
property, he isready for the ceremony of the return of the purchase money
(qaute’x-a), This may be done either in the ba’/xus season or during the
ts’e’ts’aeqa. The ceremonies at both seasons are much alike. I will
describe here the former, as the latter form a part of the winter cere-
monial. The father-in-law calls his clan together.! They all come, and

1 Saying to his messengers, Haga Lé/lala XEns nf’mé/muta.

422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

at this meeting he informs the people what amount of property he is
going to give to his son-in-law, and what names the latter is to receive
from him; also if he is going to receive his house, his carvings, and
his dance. The clan offer the father-in-law their help if he should
not haye enough property. On the following morning the father-in-law
and the son-in-law each call their clan. The young man assembles his
people in his house and tells them what he expects his father-in-law to
give him, and requests the people to dress as nicely as they can.! They
put on their button blankets and down and paint their faces. They
remain in front of their house while the father-in-law’s people take
the ceremonial box lids and place them on the beach in the form of
a square, the sides of which are about 100 feet long. This is called
the canoe (ma/wa), and all the property that is to be given to the son-
in-law is placed in this inclosure. From one or two corners of this
“canoe” cedar bark ropes are stretched to the front corners of the
young man’s house. All the spoons and dishes which the father-in-law
is going to give away are tied to them. They are called the anchor
line of the canoe. The father-in-law calls his clan inside the square.’
They all carry staffs. One of them sings out “hu, hai, ha!” and all
respond, wu! This is repeated four times. The clan of the son-in-law,
who are on the summer seat in front of the house, repeat the cries.
After this each party sing ten songs in turn. Then the wife of the son-
in-law steps out of the canoe dressed in her best. She wears a blanket
set with abalone shells. A large abalone shell is fastened to her nose by
strings which pass over her ears, as the shell is too heavy to be worn
suspended from the septum. For the same reason her earrings are worn
suspended from the hair. She performs a dance, after which her orna-
ments are given to her husband.

The mother-in-law is also in the “canoe.” It is customary that dur-
ing the time preceding this festival people of her own and other tribes
send her small presents of food or help her carry water. In return,
she gives those who have been kind to her bracelets from out of the
‘¢ canoe.”

Now the speaker of the father-in-law calls the son-in-law, saying:
‘‘Come, take care of yourself, else you will have bad Iuck.”* He calls
four men of his own clan and says to them: ‘Come! take hold of our
property that we have in our canoe.”* Then turning again to the son-
in-law, he continues: “I made an anchor line of spoons.’ I pay you

son-in-law! This is food for your feast. Your name will be (Méana-
kula). When we turn to the ts’é’tsaeqa your name will be (Hé/ittsa-
qolis).”?

When enumerating the blankets, grease, and food, the speaker
does not point at them, but takes up sticks which represent these
presents.

Then the speaker takes up a box in which the badges and whistles
of the winter dance are tied up. The box must be hidden under
the blanket, because it is ba/xus season and nobody must see it.
He says: “Come, son-in-law, and take my box.”” The young man
takes it and hides it at once under his blanket, saying: “TI shall
hide this. Thank you.”* He carries it to his house at once. ‘Then
the father-in-law’s speaker takes up the copper. If the father-in-law
has, at the time when he married, given as many as four coppers, he
will sing out:

Ee pee siaree

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hu,

The speaker holds up the copper and says: ‘Son-in-law! Now I
give you the mast of my canoe (the copper). Its name is (Ma/‘mo-
kulélag-a).4 The son-in-law carries it to his house, and when he comes
back, the speaker says: ‘And now I give you boxes from out of my
canoe.” °

After all the presents have been given, the son-in-law and a few of
his friends go to his house. The rest of his friends go up behind the
houses and walk secretly up to the end of the village. When they
have assembled there, they suddenly rush down to the “canoe” and
with an ax split one of the box covers forming a corner of the canoe.
While they are doing so the men who went into the house are beating
time and the members of the secret societies utter their cries, although
it is ba’xus season. This is called “sinking the canoe” (tso’/kunsa).
The man who split the box cover says: ‘‘ Now our loaded canoe is

broken;”! and the son-in-law replies; “Let us be glad.”* Then he
sings the following song of joy:

I will go and tear to pieces Mount Stevens, I will use it for stones for my fire,

I will go and break Mount Qa’tsta’is, I will use it for stones for my fire;

Wealth is rolling down to him from the great chiefs,
Wealth is rolling down to him from all sides; all the chiefs go to him for protection.

The breaking of the canoe indicates that all the property given to
the young man will be at once distributed among the tribe. This is
done on the subsequent day.

There is still another way by which a dance may be obtained—the
same as the crest and ba/xus (clan) names—-namely, by killing its
owner. It is said that many dances were introduced among the
Kwakiutl and related tribes in this manner. I will give a few exam-
ples of this custom, to which I briefly alluded at a former place, but
which I could not treat fully there, because the custom is so intimately
connected with the winter ceremonials. The first instance about which
J learned is the following:

Formerly the Ma/tilpé had no ha/mats’a, but only ha/mshamtsEs,
and the other tribes would not allow them to obtain one through mar-
riage. At one time a canoe of northern tribes passed near the village
of the Ma’tilpé. Two young men observed it, and they saw that there
were four nen and two women in the canoe, one of whom wore the
badges of the ha’mats’a. Then the two Ma’tilpé youths determined to
kill the ha/mats’a in order to obtain his danee. They paddled up to the
strangers, who asked the two young men to direct them to a camping
place. They did so. Then they hid their guus in the bushes near
by, and told the strangers that they were on their way to look after
their traps. They asked for the loan of the strangers’ guns. When they
had received them, they went to the place where they had hidden their
own weapons, loaded them and shot the four men and the two women.
One of the youths took the cedar bark ornaments of the ha’mats’a.
He found his whistles in a bag. At once he began to utter the
ha/mats’a’s ery “hap, hap,” for now he had the right to use the dance
owned by the man whom he had killed. He also took two coppers
which he found in the canoe. This method of obtaining a dance and
other objects is called kué/xankEm, obtained by killing.

It is the same when a novice who is being initiated is found in the
woods—the person who finds him may kill him. The murderer then
obtains his dance, and the relatives of the novice are not allowed to
take revenge.

The following very characteristic descriptions were given to Mr.
George Hunt in the summer of 1895. He tells them as follows:

I was walking on the street of the Nimkish village when I saw
He’/x‘hak-En, who was sitting on his summer seat. He called me and
said: ‘“‘O, my dear! Your days, young men, are good. But our past
ways were evil when we were all at war against each other. I mean
you have no trouble nowadays. I was three times pursued by north-
ern Indians at the time when we were still naked.” Then I asked
Heé’x-hak-En, ‘Where did this happen?” And he said, “ At Ga/widé.
We were 1n two canoes harpooning porpoises. I was in the one, my
friend, NEmoXtsaXqo‘lag-ilis, was in the other one. I had killed two
porpoises. When it got day, I saw four canoes, and I told my friend,
He said to me: ‘I will go to the island Ga/wide’; and I said, ‘I will
go to O’gwamalis. Take good care of yourself. Good bye. Then I
paddled away. My canoe was flying like a bird. Two of the canoes
pursued me, but they could not overtake me. Then I looked back and
I saw that they could not catch up with my friend, who had nearly
arrived at Ga/widé. Then I watched them and I saw how the warriors
were looking for my friend. It grew night and I felt badly, for I saw
that the warriors had a fire on the beach. I asked my steersman:
‘What do you think? Shall we look after my friend and see if they
have enslaved hin?’ He agreed, and we paddled to theisland. When
we arrived there, I took my gun and went ashore. I went to where the
fire was burning on the beach and saw that the warriors had unloaded
their canoes. I said to my companion: ‘Take care, my dear, I am
going to shoot them.’ We hauled up our canoe and hid. As soon as
we reached there, we sat down close to them. They were eating.
There were five men in line from my seat and my friend said that there
were three in line from his seat. We put thirty balls of buckshot
each in our guns and fired both at the same time. I had killed three
and wounded the two others. My friend had killed two and wounded
the third man. And I saw two more men running away. Then we
ran to the wounded ones and killed them. One man and four women
we took alive and made them our slaves. We took the property of the
northern people. I looked into a large box, and when I opened it I saw
much red cedar bark and abalone shells which were attached to if, and
whistles of a ha’/mats’a. I asked one of the women: ‘What is that in
this box?’ She only replied: ‘Hom, hom, hom, hom, hom, ham, ham,
ham, hu, hu,’ and she bit her own arm. Then I knew that one of these
men whom we shot had been a ha/mats’a. I cried hap right away.
There were also two coppers in the bottom of that box. Then we came
here to Alert Bay in the canoe of the dead men. Here we were met by
our tribe, the Nimkish. We were invited at once by Chief Koax-ila-
no/kume, together with our slaves. He gave us dried halibut to eat.
As soon as we had eaten, the chief spoke and said: ‘My dear, tell us
where did you get these women?’ Then | spoke to him and told what

had happened. But first I asked: ‘Has my friend NEmoXtsaXq0’-
lag-ilis come yet? He was pursued by these northern people and some
others whom I killed, toward Ga/wide. Then I saw these people land-
ing and thought they might have caught my friend. We went to
Lasig‘alis and watched them. We saw them making a fire on the
beach. As soon as it was night I went to Ga‘widé, because I was
troubled on account of my friend who was on the island. Then we
paddled to the east side of Ga/wide, for the northern people were stay-
ing on the north side. I went ashore and secretly went up to where
they were staying. They were just getting ready to eat. Then I went
back to my canoe and told my companion that they were just getting
ready to eat. Isaid: ‘What do you think? Letus kill them. Let us
have our own way with them and shoot them from a distance. I do
not see any danger in it... He agreed. Then we shot many of them.
I have done well.’ Thus I spoke to the Nimkish. And I said: ‘ Now,
there is some more red cedar bark for us; this box is full of various
kinds.’ I took up the coppers and said: ‘I obtained these two coppers.
The name of the one shall be Kué/xankEm (obtained by killing), and that
of the other Na/lgEmala (day on its face)? Then L’umx-ilag-ilis arose
and spoke: ‘Thank you, cousin! Now you obtained by killing this red
cedar bark and what is in this box. Now take care, Chief! You must
show it in the coming winter ceremonial. Now you know what we
have done. You may tell it when a person asks where we obtained
these dances. Now let all the profane go out of the house that you
may see the red cedar bark, else you might say that I invented it.
Now you shall know it, chiefs of the Nimkish, and you, young men of
the Nimkish.’

“Then La/gesawa spoke: ‘Truly now I believe that our chief has
done well. Now you, young men, go out of the house! Only our chiefs
shall stay here.’ Then all the men went out and only six chiefs stayed
in the house. Then we bolted the door of my house and I opened the
box. I put around my neck the ring of red cedar bark and I put the
headring on my head. Then I took the whistles and showed them to all
the chiefs and I cried ‘hap’ as the ha’mats’a cries now-a-days. Ispoke:
‘Now look at me, Nimkish chiefs. This cedar bark ornament I obtained
by killing its owner. Therefore you must not say anything against
me. Examine it closely, else you will say later on when I give my
winter dance that I invented it’ Then 1’a’qoLas said: ‘Chief, what
can we say against you since you killed these men? You have obtained
this ornament from the man whom you have killed, therefore it is called
obtained by killing. It is the same as though you had obtained your
ha/mats’a through marriage. Now go on and give a winter dance.
Why should we not do it in the right way?’? Then my brother’s son
disappeared right away, and when he came back in winter he was my
ha/‘mats’a. That is what I did in the past. Now you know it.”

It is stated by the testimony of all the older Indians that the whole

ha‘mats’a ceremonial was obtained in this manner by killing a great
number of He/iltsuq. The war in which this happened is one of the
most famous ones in the history of these tribes. I give here a version
obtained by Mr. Hunt.

The Bilxula made war upon the Qoe/xsovéndx. It was autumn.
They landed above the village Qoa’yastEm and hauled their canoes
ashore. Late in the evening they sent spies out to examine the village.
About midnight, when all the (Qoe/xsot’endx were asleep, the Bi'lxula
launched theircanoes and divided. One-half went to the east end of the
village, and one-half to the west end. They stayed in their canoes not
far from the beach until it was almost daylight. It was foggy. As
soon as it grew daylight they landed and many men went to the rear
of the houses. As soon as they were ready the most courageous war-
riors broke into the doors of the houses and speared men, women, and
children. Whoever tried to escape through the rear door was speared
by the men stationed there. Others of the Bi/lxula looked after the
valuable property and put it into their canoes. Now the Qoe’xsot’?enox
were all killed. Only seven men and five women were left. Then the
Bi/lxula set fire to the houses. Their canoes were deeply loaded with
men’s heads. They wenthome. At that time people of different tribes
had stayed at Qoa/yastEm; Ma/maléleqala, Lau/itsis, Nimkish, and
Na‘qoaqtoq, all guests of the Qoe/xsotendx. They were all slain by
the Bi/Ixula and also some who belonged to the Kwakiutl. Then
four men came and told what had happened to Neqga’/p’Enk-Em, chief of
the Kwakiutl, who was Qoe’/xsot/enox by his father’s side. Then he
called the Kwakiutl and asked them to go to war against the Bi/lxula.
Then four men were sent to ask the Ma’maleleqala, Nimkish, and Lau’-
itsis to go to war also. And they also asked the La/Lasiqoala and the
Na/qoaqtoq. Four very strong men were selected, and after six days
they came back again. When they came back to Tsaxis, NEqa’p’-
enk-Em invited them and when they were seated in his house, he called
all the Kwakiutl to hear the reports of the messengers. When the
people had come, he asked them to be silent and to listen to the words
of the messengers. One of them said: * In four days they will all be
ready to come, men and women. All decided to go to war against the
Bi/lxula.” Then Ya’/xLEn said: ‘‘ Now go, Kwakiutl! Prepare to go,
that we may not stay another night when they come. And let our
wives wash for four days that we may have good luck. After they had
eaten, the men who were going to war took seaweed and blew into it
until it nearly burst. Then they made neck rings out of it. When they
had done so, Neqa’/p’Enk-Em invited all the men and women to his house.
He told them what to do, for he knew all the customs of ancient times.
He spoke: “Thank you, Kwakiutl, thank you and your beloved wives.
Now Kwakiutl, we will soar up and catch in our talons the Bi/lxula. We
will be the great thunderbird. We will revenge our fathers, our
mothers, our uncles, our aunts, our sisters, and our younger brothers,
428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and also the chiefs, our grandfathers, Ya/qaLanlists’e and LEk:amaxot
Therefore, I call you to make war upon the Bi’lxula, for they have our
names and our red cedar bark. Now, take great care, else we shall not
get back our dancing masks. Now we will go and take back the names
of our dancing masks. For these we will fight against the Bi/Ixula.
Now go to-morrow morning and rub your bodies with hemlock branches.
You men go altogether to one place. And you women go to another
place and rub yourselves also with hemlock branches, for we shall meet
later on as though we were fighting. Do not laugh, you women, but
carry your kelp in which the breath of your husbands is enclosed.
Throw it at your husbands, and when we finish, go into the water.
When a kelp tube bursts, its owner must not accompany us, for he
would never return.”

Then YéqaLalasame arose and spoke: “ My tribe, I am glad on
account of your speech. I heard it said that we are going to war.
What tribe are we going to make war upon?” He pretended not to
know. ‘Then Ya/xLEn replied: “Chief, we are going to make war upon
the Bi‘lxula.” Then the great warrior uttered the ha’mats’a ery and
said: ‘*That was my desire, for that is the only tribe in whose blood I
did not dip my hands. Thank you, Kwakiutl, but take care! You
must arise in the morning before the crow cries. Do not wear blankets,
but you women wear the kelp rings. That is all I want to tell you.”
Then the men left the house and went to sleep. On the next morning
the great warrior YéqaLalasame himself awakened them before the
crows were stirring. Then all the men and women arose. Only those
who were menstruating were not allowed to go. First the men went to
get hemlock branches, then the women did the same. Then they all
went into the sea and sat down erying, “hi, hu, ha.” They rubbed their
bodies with hemlock branches. When they came out of the water, their
bodies were all red. They wiped themselves and then men and women
met. Now the ha/mats’a, bear dancers and ni’/LmaL, and all the other
dancers, became excited. The women did the same, and then men and
women pretended to fight. The women threw the kelp rings at their
husbands, who tried to catch them. When a man missed his kelp ring
or when it burst, he was not allowed to go on the war expedition. For
four days the men and women continued to do this. When they had
finished, they prepared their weapons. After five days the Ma‘maleéle-
qala arrived in four canoes, the Nimkish in six canoes, the Lau‘itsis in
two canoes, the Ts’a/watEénox in eight canoes. Then NrEqa’/p’Enk‘Em
invited all the tribes. When they were in his house, he gave them
dried salmon and afterwards clover root. Before they finished this
course Neqa’p’Enk'Em arose and said: “Fathers, uncles, brothers,
children, thank you that you have come. Now let us go and look for our
exterminated tribe, the Qoe/xsot’éndx, who were eaten by the Bi/lxula.
Let us make them vomit our tribe.” And all repeated his words and
said: “ You have said it. Wewill doit.” But NEqa’p’Enk’Em did not
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 429

stop speaking. He continued: ‘Therefore I called you to make war
upon the Bi/lxula. My tribe, the Kwakiutl, have eight canoes; the
Q’o’moyué have four canoes; the Walas Kwakiutl have two canoes;
the Q’o‘mk-ttis two canoes. We have sixteen canoes. Nobody whom
we meet hereafter shall live. That is all.” Then Ma’Xnua, chief of the
Ma/maléleqala arose and spoke: ‘You are good, you are great, Kwa-
kiutl What is it you are saying? Do you say we intend to go to
war?” Neqa’p’Enk:Em replied: “Yes; we will go to war.” Then
Ma/Xua said: “Thank you, friend. Thank you, Kwakiutl. Look at
the tears on my face which I wept for the Qoé/xsot’énox, for our lost
names. Now take care, warriors of the Ma’maléleqala, and you Nim-
kish, Lau/itsis, Maa/mtag-ila, and Ts’a/watkenox, else we shall not get
any heads. Let us start early in the morning. And I will be your
guide, for my ancestor was the killer whale. Therefore I am not afraid
of anything, neither of war nor of distributing property.” Then they
left the house.

Early the following morning they started. When all the tribes had
come to the island opposite Gua/ts’e, NEqa/p’Enk‘Em and Ye’qatala-
samé arose and the former spoke, ‘ Iriends, now our season will change
from ba’‘xus to ts’é’/ts’aéga as soon as we cut off the head of a man.
Then our ha/mats’a, bears and ntiLmaL, the hawi/nalaL, and all the
other winter dancers, will become excited. Now let spies go ahead in
four canoes. Now we are no longer men, we are killer whales. When
you see a canoe, fire a gun that we may know it. Then take hold
of the canoe, but do not hurt them until we come.” N&qa’p’Enk‘Em
finished speaking and sat down. Then one canoe of the Kwakiutl, one
of the Ma/maléleqala, one of the Nimkish, and one of the Lau‘itsis went
ahead. They steered to G:isg‘iltEm. When they had passed the
island, the other war canoes followed. At night they stopped at
Nux'sagoit. Early the next morning YéqaLalasamé sneezed. Then
he awakened all the men and said, ‘Slaves! I sneezed with my right
nostril. To-day we shall stain our hands in blood.” Then the four
spies started again. They did not see canoe nor smoke and all the
warriors became sorry. Now they arrived at the mouth of Rivers Inlet.
Then MaXua, chief of the Ma/maléleqala spoke, ‘ Listen to me, friends.
My heart feels badly, because we have not yet seen anyone whom we
might slay. Let us play with the Awi’k’endx, the tribe of this place,
to gladden my heart.” The warriors did not want to do it, and while
they were still talking the report of two guns was heard. ‘Now,
slaves, paddle. Those were our spies.” Then all the men paddled on.
The Kwakiutl came to a place where six canoes of Hé/iltsuq were lying
and the four canoes of their spies. The Nimkish were the next to
arrive. Then came the Lau/itsis, and far behind the others the Ma’ma-
leleqala. The He’iltsuq were telling about their voyage and also that
the Bi‘lxula had barricaded their houses. Then Yé/qaLalasame said,
“ Friends, ask the Hé/iltsuq who is their chief.” Then Kalam asked
430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

for the chief of the He‘iltsuq. One man by the name of Yéimats’alis
replied, ‘All these men are chiefs of the O’yala-itx. That is the custom
of the He/iltsuq when they distribute blankets, all their chiefs go
inviting. Now I will give you the names: This is O/mx~it, this Wa’k-as,
this Ha/mts’it, this GOxsEmna/kula, this La‘qoag-ila, Wa/waxamis,
Do’koaya-isala, Hii’/masilak", Ya/kaL’Enala, Hana/yus, Quina, Gue’l-
tok", Ga/ide, La/Lilila, and Kala’/guyuwis; they are all chiefs.” Then
La/LaLanam spoke; ‘How do you feelnow? You said before you would
not have mercy even on your relatives. Now here are all the chiefs
of the Hé/‘iltsuq.” Then O/mx”it untied the cover of his box and took
out his whistles. He gave them to his son Wa/k-as, and O/mx”it him-
self took the Lao/laxa! horn and blew if four times, and Wa/k-as blew
the ha/mats’a whistles. Then Ya/xLEn arose and said, ‘“‘ Don’t let the
voice of the ts’etsaeqa sound too loud. You heard it. We cannot
hurt the red cedar bark that sounded before all of you. Let us meet
them with our ts’e/tsaéqa at the dancing season. We will rival with
the dances of our brother O’ts’e’stalis, O’mx”it, Wa/k-as, and Quina.
We cannot kill the He‘iltsuq. Let us go to war against the Bi/lxula.”
He was just speaking so when the Ma/maleleqala came in sight around
the point of the bay. They saw the canoes drifting, and MaXua arose
at once and said: ‘* Why do you let your canoes drift about?” And
Ya/yaqadalaL took up his lance and killed the steersman of one of the
He‘iltsuq canoes. As soon as he had done so he eried, “hup, hup, htp.”
Then all the tribes attacked the Hée/iltsuq. Only O’/mx”it was not killed.
As soon as the ha/mats’a killed a man he cried, “hap, hap, hap,” the
bear growled, and every dancer became excited as soon as he killed a
man. When all the He/iltsuq were dead, they took their freight and
divided it. But the red cedar bark and the whistles of the ha/mats’a
and of the Lao/laxa were given to the war chiefs. Al the chiefs of the
Hé/iltsuq were ha/mats’a. Now, O/mx”’it was a slave of Ma/Xua, the
chief of the Ma/maléleqala. Then NEqa‘p’Enk:Em said: “ Friends, what
do you think? Shall we go on to the Bi/lxula? Think of it, friends!
We have done a great thing. The chiefs O’ts’e’stalis, Ba‘salaL,
Wixwaqoqamaya, and Wa’yats’uLa have not come here. They are
near relations of those whom we killed. Are you not afraid of them?
Then there are all the sons of O/ts’e’stalis. I think we ought to go
home.” Then they all returned. They had obtained all the names and
all the dances of the dead chiefs of the He/iltsuq. Since that time the
tribes have the cedar bark ornaments of the He/iltsug and their names.
They obtained them by spilling the blood of these men in war.’

I have given these reports in some detail, as aside of the light they
throw upon the acquisition of names and dances by war, they show

also that the societies are recognized on war expeditions. I shall
revert to this subjeet later on.

Notwithstanding the fact that each and every dance must be obtained
by means of a marriage or by killing its owner, there are a number of
offices connected with the ceremonials of the societies which are strictly
hereditary in the male line and remain, therefore, always in the same
clan. To this class belongs the office of the master of ceremonies, the
officer who has charge of the drum, of the batons, of the eagle down,
and others which will be set forth in the description of the ceremonial
(Chapter 1X). This is another argument in favor of the theory expressed
above that the institutions of the Kwakiutl were at one time paternal,
but were later on modified by the influence of the northern tribes, who
are on a maternal stage.

VIII. THE DANCES AND SONGS OF THE WINTER CEREMONIAL.

The object of the whole winter ceremonial is, first, to bring back the
youth who is supposed to stay with the supernatural being who is
the protector of his society, and then, when he has returned in a state

of ecstasy, to exorcise the spirit which possesses him and to restore
him from his holy madness.

These objects are attained by songs and by dances. In order to
bring the youth back, members of all the secret societies perform their
dances. It is believed that they will attract the attention of the absent
novice, until finally one of the dances may excite him to such a degree
that he will approach flying through the air. As soon as he appears
his friends endeavor to capture him. Then begins the second part of
the ceremony, the exorcising of the spirit; or, as the Kwakiutl call it,
the taming of the novice. This is accomplished by means of songs
sung in his honor, by dances performed by women in his honor, and by
the endeavors of the shaman. After the novice has thus been restored
to lus senses, he must undergo a ceremonial purification before he is
allowed to take part in the ordinary pursuits of life. The strictness
and severity of this purification depend upon the character of the
dance. Novices must drink water through the wing bone of an eagle,
as their mouths must not touch the brim of the eup; they must suck

no more and no less than four times, They must not blow hot food,
else they would lose their teeth.

The songs mostly consist of four verses. Each novice, viz, member
of a society, has his own songs. They open with a burden which
varies according to the society to which they belong. This burden is

sung in order to indicate the tune. Then follow the words, which,
however, are interspersed with repetitions of the burden. The words
are called “the walk of the song” (or, as we should say, the words go
this way). Each song is accompanied by beating of time with batons,
and by a drum. The beating is sometimes so loud that it almost

drowns the song. The rhythm of the tune, as well as of the beating,
is exceedingly complex; but the most striking characteristic is the fact
that the beating is always syncopated. The arm is raised when the
tone is uttered and falls quickly afterwards. In all songs of the win-
ter ceremonial the beating begins several bars before the singing. It

{

is the reverse in profane songs. The beating is an intrinsic part of
the songs and can not be separated from it.

The dances of the various societies differ in character, and will be
described in the course of this chapter. They have all this in common,
that the dancer on entering the door turns once to the left at a place
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 433

between the door and the fire. Then he dances toward the right, leay-
ing the fire at his left. In the rear of the fire he turns again to the
left, and after having made a complete turn continues his course.
Every time he reaches the front or the rear of the fire, he makes a turn
and then continues his way in the same direction. Each dance con-
sists of four circuits around the fire. The motions of the feet follow
the rhythm of the beating, not of the song.

When a mistake is made in these songs or dances which are intended

to pacify the novice, the effect is not only a renewed ecstasy of the
novice, but it also excites all the older members of the various societies
and thus produces a general ecstasy.

Errors in rhythm, turning the wrong way in a dance, smiling, and
chewing gum are counted as mistakes. The error must be atoned for by
an initiation of the person who made the mistake. When the members
of the seal society observe a mistake, they jump from their seats and bite
and scratch the person who made the mistake. He drops down at once

and pretends to faint, and while the excited dancers surround him he
disappears. This means that a spirit has taken him away in order to
initiate him. The members of the seal society sit on the platform of
the house or stand during the dances, that they may be certain to dis
cover mistakes. The seal society attack and maltreat throughout the
ceremonial the qué’qutsa. At the close of the winter ceremonial they
must pay an indemnity for all the damage that they may have done.
No greater misfortune, however, can happen than for one of the

to give the new festival, it is said that in former times the unfortu-

The view taken by the Kwakiutl is evidently that the falling of a
ha’mats’a or of another dancer is an indication of either ill will on the
part of the spirit, or as a defeat of their spirit by that of another tribe.
Thus I was told that at one time the Kwakiutl had invited the

their own.

When one of the dancers of an inferior society falls, he disappears
also to be initiated, but his father does not need to go to the expense
of a complete festival, as these initiations are much less expensive.

The paraphernalia of the dances consist largely of ornaments made
of cedar bark, which is dyed in the juice of
alder bark; of masks, whistles, and carvings of
various kinds. All of these must not be seen UM
by the profane. If any of these happened to see pe i
them, they were killed without mercy. As an ex- fai

because it is emptied of everything that is profane. Only when
dances are performed, are the uninitiated or the profane allowed to
enter the house. They must stay at the left-hand side of the entrance.

Most of the dances are performed in connection with feasts. Others
are shown in connection with distributions of property. As during
the ceremonial the clans are suspended, the order of seats which pre-
vails in Summer is also Suspended, and a new
arrangement takes place. The seal society
have the seats of honor in the rear of the
house, and among them the highest ha/mats’a
has the first seat, in the middle of the rear
of the house. At both sides of the ha/mats’a
society sit the bear dancers and other mem-
bers of the seal society. At the extreme
ends of this society sit the nu/LmaL, the mes-
sengers of the ha/mats’a. The killer whale
and rock cod societies sit in front of the seal
society. They are the singers.

The hée/mEIk and the whale society sit next
to the ni’‘LmaL—the former to the left of the
ha’‘mats’a, the others to his right. The Kos-

of the house. The women sit all along the

sit in the middle—first those of the Kwakiutl, at each side those of the
Ma/maléleqala, at their sides those of the Nimkish and Lau/itsis. The
other groups arrange themselves in the same manner, the Kwakiutl
members sitting in the rear row nearest the rear of the house; then
toward the door follow the Ma/maleleqala, continuing in the next
row nearer the fire. Then follow the Nimkish and Lau‘itsis.

The singers sit so arranged that the rear rows are facing the fire while
the front rows face backward. In their midst sits the song leader
(na/qate) and his two assistants (gua/nuLEmMé¢=sitting at his sides). It
is the duty of the song leader to make new songs, to compose new words
to old tunes, to learn quickly the
songs of the returning novice,
and to teach them to the singers.
He also gives signals for changes
in rhythm and starts the tunes.
His office is hereditary in the
male line. His assistants call out
the words for each verse. The
singers are so seated that in front
of the board which serves for their
back support they can spread
their mats, and, when kneeling
on these, have in easy reach long

them roughly smooth one end, which is used as a handle. They either
beat downward, holding the baton in their hands stretched forward,
or they hold it like a pestle and thump the plank with it. In former
times when wood was not easily split on account of lack of steel axes,
they kept the batons, which were in conse-
quence also more nicely finished. Nowadays
only the song leader and his assistants have
carved or painted batons. (Figs. 42-50.)
The ordinary crude batons are generally
split up at the end of the festival and used as
torches for lighting the way home through
the darkness of the street. It is a very pretty
sight to see the numerous guests going home,
each carrying his torch and lighting up the

swinging rattles, tue sound of which is supposed to pacify the ua/mats’a.
This office is hereditary in the male line, and either four or six of them
must accompany the ha/mats’a whenever he isin an ecstasy. They sur-
round him in a close circle in order to prevent him from attacking the
people and utter the pacifying cries ‘“hoi’p, hoi’/p.” The rattles of the
hée'lig-a are always carved with a design which originally represented a
skull. Figures 51 and 52 show this design clearly, but it often degen-
erates into the representation of a conventional face, and in some cases
it has simply a rounded shape, and an animal is carved on its face.
(Figs. 53-59.) Ido not knowif the beautiful rattles which are used by
the hé/lig-a of the Kwakiutl, but which were made by the He‘iltsuq and
represent the thunder bird on a round rattle (fig. 60), had originally ¢
different meaning. In olden times, when the ha/mats’a was in a state of
ecstasy, slaves were killed for him, whom he devoured. The following
facts were observed by
Mr. Hunt and Mr. Moffat
in the early days of
Fort Rupert: When a
ha/mats’a had returned
from the woods, a slave,
a man of the Nanaimo
tribe, named Xu/ntEm,
was shot. They saw
him running down to
the beach, where he
dropped. Then all the

tribe went down to the
beach carrying knives

The nw’/LmaL cut the
body with their knives and lances and the ha/mats’as squatted down
dancing and erying “hap, hap.” Then the bear dancers took up the
flesh and, holding it like bears and growling at the same time, they
gave it to the highest ha/mats’a first and then to the others.' In mem-
ory of this event a face representing Baxbakualanu Xsi/wacé was carved
in the rock on the beach at the place where the slave had been eaten.
The carving is done in sandstone, which was battered down with stone

1Mr. George Hunt, who told me this story as reported to him by his father, who had
been an eyewitness, added the following remarks, which are of interest as clucidat-
ing some of the views of these tribes. The slave’s wife was at that time in the fort.
She went out on the gallery and called out to the ha/mats’a: ‘‘I will give you five
years to live. The spirit of your winter dance ceremonial is strong, but mine is
stronger. You killed my husband with gun and bullet, and now I will kill you with
the point of my tongue.” After five years all those who had taken part in the murder
were dead.

During the fourth night they were taken out of the

Near this rock carving there are a number of

The Indians have
no recollection of the incidents

They say that they were made
at the time before animals were
transformed into men.

I received another report of the
killing of a slave. A female slave
was asked to dance for the ha’-
mats’a. Before she began dan-
cing she said: ‘ Do not get hungry,
do not eat me.”! She had hardly
said so when her master, who was
standing behind her, split her
skull with an ax. She was eaten
by the ha/mats’a. This happened
in Newettee, and Q’omumna/kula,
who participated in the perform-
ance, was living until a couple of
years ago. He told me that it
is exceedingly hard to eat fresh
human flesh, much more so than
to eat dried

that if they were buried they would

When the ha/mats’a had bitten a piece
out of the arm of one of his enemies, he
drank hot water after having swallowed
the flesh. It was believed that this would
result in the inflammation of the wound.
Nowadays, when the ceremonies have
lost much of their former cruelty, they do
not actually bite the piece of flesh out of

the ear until after the dance, when it is returned to the owner, in order
to assure him that it will not be used against him for purposes of
witchcraft.

Besides devouring slaves, the ha’mats’as also devour corpses. When
a new ha/mats’a, after being initiated, returns from the woods he will
sometimes carry a corpse, which is eaten after his dance. The bodies
are prepared for this ceremony. The skin is cut around the wrists and
ankles, as they must not eat the hands and feet. It is believed that
else they would die immediately. The ha’mats’a must use for this cere-
mony the corpse of one of his deceased relatives, which the he/lig-a
must prepare. The wakiutl used to bury their dead on trees. The
body was placed in a box, and these
boxes were placed on branches a
considerable distance up a_ tree.
There the boxes were piled one on
top of the other (Plate 27). The
bodies, when so exposed to the ac-
tion of the freely circulating air,
mostly mummify. A corpse is taken
down from the tree and is soaked in
salt water. The he/lig-a takes hem-
lock twigs, the leaves of which have
been removed, and pushes them un-
der the skin, gradually removing all
the decayed flesh until nothing
but the skin remains. After this is
done the body is placed on top of
the small hut in which the novice
(gi’yakila) is living while he is
staying in the woods. The hands
of the body hang down. Its belly
is cut open and spread with sticks.
The ha/mats’a keeps a fire under it
and smokes it. Four days before
he returns to the village he sends for all the old ha/mats’as. When
they come, he tells them: “These are my traveling provisions, which
I received from BaxbakualanuXsi/wae.”! He asks them to point out
what shares they desire to have when he will return. They take
the body down and place it on a clean mat. Each points out what
he desires to have. His return will be described later on (p. 527).
His k-i/nqalaLala returns with him. She carries the corpse which has
been prepared. She goes backward, facing the ha’mats’a. When she
reaches the right side of the fire, the ha/mats’a enters the house. He
stoops so that his face is close to the ground. On entering, he turns
four times, descends to the middle of the house, and when he is four
steps away from the door, he turns again four times. When the

is placed in the middle of the rear of the house, bottom up. The
k-i/ngalanala pretends to put the corpse on the drum, but walks past
it, the ha/mats’a following her. At the door she turns again, pro-
ceeds around the fire, and when she reaches the drum a second time,
she turns again and
pretends to put the
body down. At this
time all the old ha’-
mats’as, who have
been outside the
house, jump down
from the roof and
rush in through the
doors. They are all
naked and follow the
k-i/nqalaLala in a
state of high excite-
ment. When they
have run around the
fire four times, the

The master of cere-
monies (see p. 501) begins to cut it and distributes the flesh among the
ha’mats’a. But first the k-i/nqalaLala takes four bites. The people
count how many bites each of them sv allows. They are not allowed
to chew the flesh,
but they bolt it.
The .ki/nqalatala
brings them water
to drink in between.

of the ceremony is
finished, the hé/ligra

head, and they drag
them to the salt
water. They go into
the water until it
reaches up to their
waists, and, fac-
ing the rising sun, they dip the ha/mats’a four times under water.
Tivery time he rises again he cries hap. Then they go back to the
house. Their excitement has left them. They dance during the fol-
lowing nights. They look downcast and do not utter their pecu-
liar cries, hap, hap. They do not dance squatting, but in an erect

position. After the close of the ceremonial the ha/mats’a by the pay-

The ceremonial of the return of the

other when he is becoming pacified.

His first dance and sometimes part of the second are danced in the
former position, the others are danced in the second position. The
first dance represents him as looking
for human flesh to eat. He dances
in a squatting position, his arms
extended sideways and trembling
violently (fig. 62). He first extends
them to the right, then to the left,

from time to time from the slow trembling movement to the long leaps. |
During this time his k-i/nqalaLala—if he is a novice—dances backward
in front of him. She stands erect and holds her hands and forearms
extended forward as though she was carrying a body for the ha’mats’a
to eat. Then his eyes are directed to her hands, which she keeps mov-
ing up and down a little with each step. Her open palms are turned
upward. In his second dance the
ha’mats’a dances standing erect.
While in his first dance he is naked,
he is now clothed in a blanket.
Now he holds his forearms upward,
the elbows being near his flanks, the
palms forward, the fingers lightly
bent. His hands are still trembling
violently. His dance consists of
rhythmical steps coincident with
the beats of the batons. He takes
very high steps, so that his knees
almost touch his chest. When rais-
ing one foot, he bends at the same
time the knee of the
other leg, and thus
drops his trunk consid-
erably without chang-
ing his position (Plate
28). He always puts
down the whole sole
of his foot.

When hefirstreturns
from his initiation, he
wears a head ring, neck
ring, waist ring, brace-
let, and anklets made
of hemlock branches.
The form of these rings

origin. While most of
them have plain hemlock rings, one ha/mats’a of the Koskimo has his
set with small rings of white peeled twigs, which set off clearly against
the dark green ring of balsam pine (see p. 595).

The painting of the face of the ha/mats’a also depends upon the
legend from which he derives his origin. Most of them have their faces
painted black all over, while others have two curved red lines on each
cheek running from the corner of the mouth to the ear in a wide curve

are living on blood. According to the legend, the various ha/mats’as
become excited by seeing certain objects or by hearing them mentioned.

or maggots or x‘a/wayu (open door). Whenever any of these words
occur in a song, or when a dance, figure, or painting is shown repre-
senting these objects, the ha/mats’a who, according to his legend, is
affected by them falls into a state of ecstasy.
446 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

If the dancer is not a novice, he dances the first dance with his cedar
bark ornaments, which the new ha/mats’a does not wear until his
fourth dance. These consist of a heavy crown of plated cedar bark
and a neck ring to correspond, anklets, and bracelets (figs. 63-68).

The head ring fig. 63 is set with four crosspieces. These crosspieces
designate the gifts of the spirits who have initiated the cannibal. The
front piece represents the milky way, the cannibal pole of Baxbaku-
alanuXsi/waée, the two lateral pieces represent the ho/Xhok*. The
rear crosspiece is said to be merely an ornament. Some ha/mats’as
wear a bear skin which is set with the scalps of the slaves whom he
has eaten or of the enemies whom he has slain. The symbolic meaning
of a number of crosspieces
will be described in detail
further on (p. 449).

During the dances of the
ha’mats’a whistles are
heard (figs. 69-74), which
represent the voices of the
spirits. Most of these
whistles are small. They
are made of red cedar. A
few are made of: bone.

After his first dance, the

house. It is called the ma/wiL, and is supposed to be the house of
BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. Its front is painted with designs which repre-
sent either the face of BaxbakualanuXsi’waé himself or that of his
servant the raven. The top of the front is set with fringes of red
cedar bark (fig. 75). The room is always so arranged that when the
ha/mats’a reappears, he comes out of the mouth of the painting on its
front. Plate 29 shows the ha’mats’a coming out of the secret room,
which is painted with the design of the raven. His attendants, as
soon as he appears, run up to the secret room and hold the ha/mats’a
at his neck ring. Then he comes forward and performs his dance.

This room is used only by the novice. For him also a high pole is
erected in the middle of the rear of the house. It is called the
ha/msp’eq, the cannibal pole. It is a mast from 30 to 40 feet high,
which is wound with red cedar bark. At the top is a short crosspiece
about 4 feet in length. The cedar bark extends up to it so that it
forms a triangle at the top of the pole. Sometimes a triangle painted
with the face of Baxbakualanu Xsi'waeé is fastened to it instead.

As mentioned before, the novice after his first dance disappears into
his secret room. Soon his cries are heard again, and he is seen coming
out backward at the side of the ma/wiL. He wears the mask of the
raven, Qoa‘qoaXualanuXsi’wae (fig. 76), which it is supposed is growing

somebody else who dances in his place. He crouches so that the long
beak of the bird is close to the ground and turns his head with sudden
jerks to the right and to the left. Both his hands are hidden under
his blanket and with them he pulls strings which make the jaw of the
mask open and shut very rapidly, thus producing a loud clappering

‘noise. As soon as the mask
appears, the singers begin
the following song:

It will be noticed that some of these masks are set with skulls carved
of wood. These have various meanings. They may indicate that the
mask was obtained in war, or that as many slaves were killed for
the novice as there are skulls attached to the mask, or finally they may
belong traditionally to the particular ha’mats’a. Throughout these
ceremonies it must be borne in mind that the different ha/‘mats’as have

Heis carrying the ha’mats’a head mask which he obtained from BaxbakualanuXsi/ wae
all around our world.)

After he has danced around the fire four times he disappears, and then
the ha/mats’a comes again from out of the ma/wiL dressed in his orna-
ments of red cedar bark and dances in an erect position,

When an old ha/mats’a performs these dances, the masks donot appear,
but he dances
four times in
succession, first
in the squat-
ting position,
then the latter
part of the sec-
ond dance and
his third and
fourth dances
erect.

the raven mask; then the dancer performs
his second dance, wearing the ornaments

The raven mask (fig. 82) belonged orig- a
inally to a ha/mats’a of the Heé/iltsuq, from whom the Kwakiutl
obtained it by marriage. When in use, a sleeveless waist of eagle
skins which reaches down to the hips is attached to it. The arms of
the dancer are tied with red cedar bark above the elbows and at
the wrists. He wears an ordinary neck ring. He also wears bands
around knees and ankles and a waistband, all made of red cedar bark
similar to those worn by the dancer represented in Plate 31. The
legend from which the mask derives its origin is as follows: A chief

was deserted on an island by his slaves. He thought he would
have to die of hunger. He sat down and covered his face with his
blanket and cried. Then he heard his name being called. He looked
up, but did not see anyone. He covered his head again. Soon his
name was called a second time, but he could not discover anyone. The
same hap-
pened a third
time. Then
he bit a hole
in his cedar
bark blanket
and peeped
through it.
Soon he saw
a mouse com-
ing out of a hole and calling him. He
threw off his blanket and spoke to the

mouse, who invited him to enter. She

warned him, however, to take care of the
door. The chief followed her. She led
him down the rock to Q’0’moqoae’s house.
The door of the house was the raven,
Qoa/qoaXualanuXsi/waé, who snapped
at everybody who entered the house.
The chief jumped through the door
when it opened. Q’o’/maqoaé gave him
the ha/mats’a dance and the raven mask.

In order to explain the meanings of
the crosspieces on the head rings and
of the attachments to the neck rings of
the ha/mats’a, I must insert a few tradi-
tions referring to this subject:

Following is the legend of the origin
of the G-agg-aénox:

The first of the A’wa-iLala lived at
Ts’a’wate. Their chief was Gu/mg-ila.
His sons were Qoa/wiLpé and Xa/niats’-
amgilak". They were always very happy,
because their tribe was numerous. One
night they were attacked, and Gu’/mg-ila
and his two sonsalone were saved. When
the day came Xa/niats’amg-ilak" felt very ill at ease and told his father:
“JT will go into the woods. Do not try to see me, my dear!” His father
replied: “Only take care, my son, lest something might happen to
you. Do nothing that is wrong, because you intend to go and obtain a
magic treasure. Rub your body for four days with hemlock branches,
else you will smell like man.” Then they separated. The young man

went into the woods at once and rubbed his body with hemlock
branches for four days. He did not speak to anybody. Then he walked
up the river Ts’a/waté and came to a lake. A loon swam to the shore
and asked him: “What are you doing here?” Xa/niats’amg-ilak"
replied: “Iam looking for a magic treasure.” ‘Take my name,” said
the loon. “Your name is now Ta’l-

Xa/niats’amg‘ilak" left the lake and
went up the river. He arrived at the
next lake and sat down on the shore.
Now he saw a seal coming ashore.
The seal said: ‘‘What are you doing

himself. For four days he stayed there and washed and rubbed his body
with hemlock branches. Then he went to the top of the mountains.
He came to the top of the great mountain Da’duqola. He did not see

see anything there. Therefore he felt badly and was about to turn
homeward. Then he discovered steam rising halfway down the moun-
tain. He went to that place. It was evening when he arrived there.
He saw a lake with steep precipices all around it, like to a washtub.
He tried to find a way 'to go down to the lake. He slept during the
night. In the morning he twisted
cedar twigs. He made four long
pieces so that the end reached down
to the water. Now he saw a small
island floating on the lake. He
climbed down the cedar rope and
came to the lake. Then the fishes
in the lake covered his whole body
and sucked at it. After he had
bathed he climbed up the rope
again. The fishes had sucked at
his body so that it was all covered
with blood. In the evening he
climbed down again. The fishes
tormented him in the same manner.

canoe on the lake with fifteen men in it. Fourteen were paddling and
one was standing in the bow of the canoe. He carried a spear in his
hand. They kept close to the island. Three times they went around it.
Then Xa/niats’amg-ilak" climbed down his rope. As soon as he reached

raised his head. After a short time the canoe came to the place where
he was in hiding. He took hold of the canoe under its bow. Then the
men became afraid and rushed.to the stern of the canoe. The chief
of the men said: “Look what stops our canoe!” One of the men saw

into the canoe. Then he took the canoe
and squeezed it in his hands, so that it
became small, and he put his cedar bark
ornaments on the head of Xa/niats’amgi-
lak". Then the harpooner told him what
todo. He said: ‘‘Take care! Sprinkle
the water of life on him whom you want
to resuscitate. If you show your fire
whatever you point at will be burnt,
however far it maybe; and when you go
to war, take the death bringer, and all
your enemies will die. And you will kill
all the sea monsters and all kinds of
animals. When you want to go any-
where in your canoe, just put it into the
water, go aboard, and say, ‘paddle.’
Thenits paddles will move by themselves,
Its name is ‘ Paddle side canoe.’ ”

Then the man disappeared_.and Xa/ni-
ats’amgvilak" went home. When he was
near his home, he took the fire and tried
it on the mountains on the one side of
the house of Gu/mg:ila. They burnt
right away. Then he was glad. Now
Gu/megvila saw the mountain burning
and spoke to his other son: ‘¢O dear!
your brother has done well,” for he

thought that it was he who made the mountain burn. Not long after
Xa/niats’amg-ilak" entered his father’s house. They gave him to eat

the names. After he had told his father, he said: ‘‘ Now let us make
war upon all the people of the world. Take a good canoe. We want
to find them who killed all our friends.”

His father said: “Yes, my son; I think you have obtained magic
power. Let us go to-morrow. Only take care of the sea monsters.”
Then Gu’mg-ila cleaned a good canoe and put the mats and paddles
into it in the evening. The next
morning he launched the canoe.
Then Xa/niats’am g-ilak" made him-
self ready and went aboard. He
called his brother Qoa/wiLpé, and
he went aboard also. Gu/mgrila
stayed ashore. Then Xa/niats’-

do not like our canoe, and I will

He jumped into it and called his

his cedar bark ring and took out the wood carving in shape of a beaver.
He said to his canoe “yiii,” and he pointed the fire bringer to the
upper end of the village and it caught fire; then to the lower end of
the village, and it also caught fire. Now he told his canoe: “ Paddle!”
and it paddled. Then Gu’mg-ila
was glad to see that his son was
a magician. They were going to
Ga’yux, and there they met the
monster sea otter. He struck it
with the death bringer, and it was
transformed into a stone. He ar-
rived at Ga/yux. Then he saw the
village and went ashore. Hewas

brothers.. After they had eaten,

Then Xa/niats’amg-ilak" said: “Thank you, my brother. I am Xa/ni-

replied: “We will go up this river.” “ Don’t do that, master, else you
will have bad luck, because there are monster herrings there.” Xa/ni-

brother and said: “Now I will change your name.” He took his broth-
er’s hands and rubbed the death bringer over them. They were turned
into stone, and he spoke: ‘‘ Now your name shall be T’étesumx:stsana.”
Nena‘lag-ila said: ‘‘O, master! you are not a common man. Now I see
what kind of a man you are. You will make war upon the monster
herrings of whom we are
afraid; but be careful.” The
canoe paddled, and he ar-
rived at that lake. When
they were in the middle of
the lake, the monster her-
rings came. He struck his
fire at them, but it did not
killthem. They jumped into
the canoe and it foundered.
Then Xa/niats’amgilak® and
his brother were dead. That
is the end.

Figures 83 to 91 represent
the cedar bark ornaments of Xa/niats’amg-ilak". In fig. 83 is shown the
head ring which he wears in his first dance. The upright piece in front
represents the magic canoe which he obtained in the lake, as related on
page 452. The upright pieces at both sides of his second head ring (fig.
84) represent the fire bringer.!| The crosspiece on the forehead of his
third head ring (fig. 85) represents the
death bringer. Figure 86 shows his
first neck ring, which has four rings at-
tached to it. By these the attendants
hold him when he is dancing the ha’-
mats’a dance. The front crosspiece of
his second neck ring (fig. 87) designates
that he has the powers of a shaman, the
other one that he was made a ha’mats’a
by encountering the spirits. Figures

season. There are still two other rings eae
worn by the dancer which refer to a por-
tion of the legend not contained in the preceding version. The crosspiece
on the head ring (fig. 90) represents the death bringer which he obtained
in the lake, while the crosspieces and the front of the neck ring (fig. 91)
represent the si/siuL which he obtained from Ts’a/eqame.

to tradition, Nomasr/nxelis, an ancestor of the Naq6/mg-ilisala had
a son named LExx:a/lixilagtt (p. 335), who obtained his dances from
the si’siuL and from the wolves. His first head ring (fig. 92) shows six
crosspieces in front. These are the death bringers, and the upright
piece on top is the fire bringer, while the square behind represents the
bucket containing the water of life.
In his second head ring (fig. 93)
only four death bringers are shown.
This ring is worn in his second
dance. As will be described below,
the Naq6‘mgvilisala and La/Lasi-
qoala take off some of the symbols
which designate the supernatural
powers of the dancer after each
dance. The ring shown in fig. 94
is stripped of all these crosspieces
and is worn by the dancer in feasts.

twocrosspieces on the sides. These

symbolized by the attachments in
front and in the back.

Another ha/mats’a of the La/Lasiqoala, on returning from the woods,
dances four nights with wreaths of hemlock branches; the following
four nights (the fifth to the eighth) without any ornaments; then
four nights (the ninth to the twelfth) with ornaments of red cedar
bark. He wears eight bundles over his forehead, which are called
k’a/siwé, and four on
each side. The next
night, after he has fin-
ished dancing, one ot the
k’a/siwé is taken off,
which is publicly an-
nounced the following
morning. The four-
teenth night two more
of these bundles are
taken away; the next,
two more; and finally,

a black line is drawn over his face from the left side of his forehead
to the right side of his chin, and then he rises to bite people. Later
on he is excited by mistakes and by songs of the ghost dancer. The
head ring is meant to symbolize the moon, and the decrease in the

size of the ring is said to signify the waning of the moon. When the
ha‘mats’a returns, a bloody line runs over his face, beginning on the
cheeks, curving up toward the nose, which it crosses in its upper por--
tion. It is said to designate the moon. The line is made by rubbing
the face with dogfish skin. It is said that this line indicates the effect
of Wina/lag-ilis’s canoe, which rubbed against the face of the novice.

Each ha/mats’a has eight songs of his own, which are composed for
him by the na‘qate at the time of his return from the woods, and are
sung whenever he dances.

A young man who first becomes a member of a secret society can not
join the ha’mats’a until after a number of years. For seven years he
must have been a member of societies of lower rank. Then in the
eighth year he may become a
ha/mats’a.

The ha’matsa’s first initia-
tion is called g:i’/yak-ila.
After four seasons he may be
given another ha/mats’a by
his father. This is called ta.
After he has been initiated
four times (vuduXp’Ena ta=
three times gone into it), he
may leave the ranks of the
ha/mats’a and become a qué’-
qutsa. This is called ‘lock-
ing the whistles into the box.”

cating everywhere; ‘‘ Baxbaku-

I did not see the dance of the

the gestures of the third line, I
must give a literal translation:

‘“T went, you cried ‘hap’ for
me, BaxbakualanuXsi/waée, at

went,” gesture as above, ‘“ you
cried ‘hap’ for me, BaxbakualanuXsi’waé,” both hands bent inward
move to the mouth, as above, designating the cannibal spirit; then
the arms are stretched far backward, the palms turned downward,
and the head is lowered, this being the cannibal spirit’s attitude
when crying hap. The same attitude is taken by the dancer wear-
ing the mask (fig. 77) when he clatters with its movable jaw, at the
sametime crying hap. “At

The presents given away at the time of the initiation of the ha/mats’a
and at his later dances are said to be swallowed by him. The song
means, therefore, that through his ecstasy his father was compelled to
give away much wealth.

HA/MATS’A SONG OF THE KOSKIMO.!

1. You will be known all over the world; you will be known all over the world,
as far as the edge of the world, you great one who safely returned from the
spirits.

2. You will be known all over the world; you will be known all over the world,
as far as the edge of the world. You went to BaxbakualanuXsi’waé, and there
you ate first dried human flesh.

3. You were led to his cannibal pole in the place of honor of his house, and his house

is our world.

You were led to his cannibal pole, which is the milky way of our world.

. You were led to his cannibal pole at the right-hand side of our world.

oe

This song was sung for a youth who had taken the place of another
one who had died. Therefore the song says that he safely returned
from the spirits. The text says: ‘You returned from Ia‘lag:ilis,” which
is another name for the spirit of the winter dance. The milky way is
the cannibal pole of BaxbakualanuXsi/waé; in other cases (see p. 405)
it is the rainbow.

his enemy, and, holding it with his teeth, he said: That is the way

of BaxbakualanuXsi/waé! And turning to his dead enemy he mocked
him, who had also been a ha/mats’a, saying: ‘“‘ Do you think you were
the real BaxbakualanuXsi/wae?” thus implying that he was more
powerful.

FEAST SONG USED IN A FEAST GIVEN IN HONOR OF THE HA/MATS’A.!

3. The ha’mats’a’s voice is heard all over the world. Assemble at your places, men!
at the edge of the world.

HA’/MATS’A SONG, LA’LASIQOALA.?

1. Truly! He goes around the whole world, the great ha’mats’a, looking for food every-
where, the great ha’mats’a, on both sides of the world.

2. Truly! He wants to eat plenty, the great ha’mats’a. He is trying to eat all himself,
the great ha’mats’a, but he did not reach the food that he was going to obtain
at the edge of the world. ;

3. He wants to eat with both hands, the great ha/mats’a, at the house of the one who
is trying to eat all himself all over the world; but he did not reach the coppers
that he was going to obtain at the edge of the world.

This translation is not quite certain. The song refers to the Goasi’la
who in olden times had many dances and did not want to give them to
the other Kwakiutl tribes, who desired to obtain them through mar-
riage. The La/Lasiqoala heard that the Goasi’/la intended to invite
them to their winter dance. They were invited and started to go, but
their chief was afraid, it seems, and returned back without attending
the feast.

K*?‘NQALALALA SONG.!

1. Begin! You whose eagle down which is strewn all over her body, fills the house,
who brings all the people together from all over the world.

2. Begin! You who make the people weak, tempting with food those who ate too
much, whose body makes the people of the whole world oversatiated.

3. Begin! You who pile the red-hot stones up to the roof of the house all over the
world.

The girl who danced this k:i/nqalaLala was a prostitute in her tribe.
She is scourged in this song. The composer meant by the eagle down
and the piles of red stones the young men who came in crowds to her
house. The meaning of the second verse becomes also clear from this
point of view. ‘

K'i/NQALALALA SONG.2

1. BaxbakualanuXsi’waé cries hap forme; he utters the ha‘mats’a cry forme. Ihave
the great supernatural power.

2. BaxbakualanuXsi’waé and his companion have thrown the sound of whistles, the
sound of the magic power into me. I have the great supernatural power.

3. I reached the place where the exciting cry of BaxbakuaélanuXsi/waé and his com-
panion is heard. I have the great magical power.

K'l’NQALALALA SONG.?

1. The sounds of the winter dance are heard wherever you are, great one.

2. Ha‘mats’a cries are heard wherever you are, great one.

3. You went right up to the raven, and the sound of fighting ravens is heard wherever
you are.

4. You went right up to the shutting mouth, and the sound of the ho’/Xhok is heard
wherever you are.

5. You went right up to him who carries one corpse on each arm for you.

The ha/mats’a ery “hap” was obtained by the Kwakiutl through
intermarriage with the Awi/k’endx. The dancer was by descent partly
Awi’k’enéx. Therefore the song says that he carried the ha/mats’a
cry through the world. (Line 4, shutting mouth=the ho’ Xhok*.)

K'i/NQALALALA SONG.4
1. I have the winter dance song, I have magic powers.
2. Ihave the ha’mats’a song, I have magic powers.
3. I have BaxbakualanuXsi’ wae’s song, I have magic powers.
4. Your magic power killed the people, and therefore they all hide before you, fear-
ing your great power.

This song belonged to a man who had killed a chief of the Qoe/xsot’-
enox, and the song refers to this fact. Later on he was killed by a
Qoe’xsot’éndx, who now owns the song.

K'f/NQALALALA SONG OF THE NIMKISH.*

+Appendix, page 695,
462 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The k-i/nqalaiala to whom belonged this song, used the rattles shown
in figs. 96,97. Each rattle represents a raven with a skull on its back;
a fish is shown on its stomach. The skull indicates that the ha/mats’a
is filled with the desire of eating
skulls. The form of the rattle
is evidently suggested by the
beautiful northern raven rattles.
(See pp. 623, 629.)

This song was also made for a
girl of ill repute who had spread
the syphilitic contagion among
her tribes. To this refers the re-
mark: ‘I cut the veins of the
wild monster.” The singers
mean that she is infecting every-
body, even the wild monster.

the tribe, her hair is falling out, and her head is covered with blood,
because it is torn by BaxbakualanuXsi/waé. She is carrying a skull in
each hand. As soon as she is seen,
the ha/mats’as begin to cry hap and
dance squatting with trembling
hands up to her, full of desire to de-
vour the heads which she is carry-
ing. The other q’0/mindqas and

as though they were carrying heads.
Thus she dances into the house, al-

By the La/Lasiqoala the q’0/mindqa dance is sometimes called yiai’-
atalaL. Among them she has the ornament shown in fig. 98. One of
her songs is as follows:’

1. Truly, the people join your dance.

2. Because you are carrying a rattle in your hand while you dance, they join in your
praise.

3. On account of all that you are carrying in your hand, they join in your praise.

THE HA/MSHAMTSES.

The Kwakiutl state that before obtaining the ha/mats’a from the
Hé‘iltsuq they had only the ha’/mshamtsEs, who is also initiated by
BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. Nowadays he is considered as inferior to the
ha’mats’a, and the dance belongs almost
exclusively to women. The ceremonial fol-
lowing the ha‘mshamtsEs’s return from his
or her initiation is the same as that of thé
return of the ha’mats’a. The ornaments
are also of the same description, except
that his cedar bark is not twisted and
plaited, but simply wound around his head,
neck, wrists, and ankles. He does not use

a ma/wiL. His cry is not hap, but wip. Fig. 98.
He does not dance in a squatting position, HEAD RING OF Q’0/MINOQA.

forward, the elbows close to his sides. His ‘Y* No St), Rov! Bim
handsare trembling. After his first dance,

which, as all others, consists of four rounds, he reappears wearing a
mask. This is either a head mask, similar to the QoaqoaXualanuX-
si/waé mask described on page 447 or it is a full face mask. Almost
all of these represent animals, the protectors of the dancer. It has
not become clear to me why it is that so many different animals may
become the protectors of the ha/mshamtsks.

I will describe a few of these masks and give the songs which belong
to them. Figure 99 is a ha‘mshamtskEs mask, the outer figure of which
represents the grizzly bear. The inner face represents Baxbakual-
anuXsi’/waé. The red rim around the mask is blood, which is shown
because the bear is cut popens in order to make the inner face visible.

464 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The painting of the face represents parts of his body. The chin tuft
is at the same time the uvula. It is the opinion of the Kwakiutl that
the uvula is the cause of hunger, and that BaxbakualanuXsi’wae has a
very large uvula, which is the cause of his voracity. The mustache
represents his legs; the green blots on the cheeks, his body. The ears
are painted over the eye, and have the shape of a raven’s ears. The
blue ornament on the forehead is merely painting, intended to fill a
gap that did not please the artist. The peculiar shape of the nose is
called “voracious nose,” and is meant to indicate that he can scent
man along distance off. The name of the owner of this mask, as a
member of the ‘seal society,” is always Na’wis. After he joins the

with this mask is as follows:

3. You went to the end of the world, led by your supernatural power.

the first one into whom BaxbakualanuXsi/waeé threw his power. Your power is
desired even at the edge of the world. Everybody desires to possess your
powers.

In connection with the mask shown in fig. 103 (p. 468) the following
song is sung:!

1. “I went all around the world with my protector, looking for food on the beach.”

2. “Thus I went and he took his cedar bark ornaments from his body and hung
them on to me.” Therefore everybody wishes to have your power, but nobody
in the whole world can imitate you.

NO/NTSISTALAL.

This dance is also said to have
been obtained comparatively re-
cently by marriage from the Awt’-
k’endx. The novice is also initi-
ated by BaxbakualanuXsi’waé, and
has the power to handle fire with
impunity. In his eestasy he takes
up glowing coals, puts them into
his mouth, and throws them upon
the people. At the end of the
dancing season he must pay for all
the damage done in this manner.
His ornaments are made of red and
white cedar bark. Following is a

While all the preceding ones belong to the laxsa, they are wi’xsa.’
Therefore at the time of the initiation they are not taken away by the
spirit, but are only hidden in a corner of the house, whence they come

forward when they are ready, to show that they have been initiated.
They are perhaps the most dreaded helpers of the ha’/mats’a, as it is
their duty, in conjunction with the nt/LmaL, to punish all transgres-
sions of laws referring to privileges of the ha/mats’a, or to the winter
ceremonial in general. I stated before that the penalty of some mis-
takes was death. The unfortunate ones were killed by the grizzly
bears and nu’/Lmat. They are also the watchers of the dancing house,
and often with the other members of the seal society assemble on the
roof, and by their wild cries and threatening attitude frighten away
everybody. They always. wear bear’s claws on their hands, and some-
times appear clad in bearskins. Their faces are painted in imitation
of an immense mouth of a bear. Their head rings and neck rings are
made of red and white cedar bark. Each of these is twisted in a tight
rope. Then they are twisted around each other and tied at their ends

(figs. 111, 112, pp. 473,474). Their circuit around the fire can hardly
be called a dance. In the first and the third dances the dancer wears
his cedar bark ornaments. The dances consist in violent motions of
the body, imitating the actions of a bear who sits on his haunches.
Every now and then the dancer growls and scratches the ground with
his paws. In the second and fourth dances he appears clad in a bear-
skin, walks on hands and feet, and paws the ground, imitating the
motions of an angry bear. .

SONG OF A BEAR DANCER NAMED WALAS NA‘NE (GREAT BEAR),!

THE NU‘/LMAL.

The noo/nLEmata (pl. of nii’‘LmaL) or “fool dancers” are also mes-
sengers and helpers of the ha/mat’sa, who help to enforce the laws
referring to the ceremo-
nial. Their method of
attack is by throwing
stones at people, hitting
them with sticks, or in se-
rious cases stabbing and
killing them with lances
and war axes.

The no0o‘nLEmaLa are -
initiated by a fabulous
people, the A/Lasimk:,
who are believed to live
near a lake inland from
LiXsi’waé. Their village
is believed to be on an is-
land floating on the lake.
They haveenormous noses
and their bodies are coy-
ered with snot. In olden
times a man went beaver
hunting and fell in with
these people. He came
back exhausted and
“crazy.” His nose was
running allthetime; heate

a long time did the people succeed in restoring him to his senses.
From him the no0/1LEmata are said to derive their origin. They are
supposed to be out of their senses and to have long noses. They are as
filthy as the first nt/LmaL is said to have been. Some of them when
initiated are taken away by the A/Lasimk-, others are initiated in the
house. The noo’nLEmata are wi/xsa. Those who are to be initiated in
the house will all of a sudden begin to seratch their heads and bodies.
They scratch more and more violently. This indicates that they are

possessed by the winter dance spirit. After four days they are confined
in the corner of the house, and appear as noo/nLEmaLa at the time of
the next dance. When a young man is to be initiated in this order,
the old no0/nLEmatLa will throw mucus from their nose on to him and
thus “throw the spirit of the winter ceremonial into him.”

The nt’/LmaL, according to what was stated above, is filthy and acts
as though he was out of his senses. His cry is we, we, we. Paintings
of fool dancers are shown on Plate 33. They do not dance, but, when
excited, run about like madmen, throwing stones, knocking people
down, and crying. They turn
to the right instead of to
the left, and make the cir-
cuit of the fire turning to
the left. Then the que’qutsa
try to correct them, but they
grow only the more excited.
They dislike to see clean and
beautiful clothing. They tear
and soil it. They break ca-
noes, houses, kettles, and
boxes; in short, act the mad-
man in every conceivable
way. At the close of the
dancing season they must in-
demnify the owners for all the
property destroyed.

475,476). Many of these lances are carved and painted with the design
of the raven. The noo’/nLEmaLa wear rings of red cedar bark, which
is simply tied around their heads and hung around their necks. It is
not plaited.

When they first appear after their initiation, and also when per-
forming their ceremonial dance they use masks. All these masks are
characterized by long noses of curiously round shape. The face is
surrounded by a red ring which represents the red cedar bark. The
type of these masks has not changed during the last century. There
is one in the U. S. National Museum that was collected by the Wilkes
Expedition (fig. 117, p.477). Another old specimen is in the British
Museum (Plate 34). The similarity of this type of mask and of the
newer ones collected of late years will be noticed (figs. 118-122, pp.
477-479). Any mention of a long nose excites the ni/LmaL. He does
not allow his nose to be touched.

to be initiated as a nii/LmaL once more, and when
he came back, he distributed an immense amount of
property, sea-otter skin blankets, canoes, slaves, cop-
pers,etc. As he was unable to bring all this property
into the house, he scattered eagle down, which sym-
bolized the property, all over his guests. Since that
time ‘property is the lance of the G-é/qaméq’0LEla,”
and the father of a new G:é/qaméqoLEla must dis-
tribute all his property at the time of the initiation
of the novice.

The dance of the Na/naqaualiL consists in very rapid motions of the
body from right to left, according to the rhythms of the song. The

sewed all over it at regular intervals of about 10 inches, and a head mask
with a long beak surmounting his forehead (figs. 124 and 125, p. 479).

The dance is sometimes also called “the dance of the wind.” The lively
motions of the blanket are supposed to be caused by the winds of
the higher regions of the atmosphere (Plate 35). The dancer is initiated

in the woods. The novice who is to acquire this dance disappears in
the woods. When he returns, he bites the people, not like the ha’mats’a,
but imitating the voracious ha”maa. His cedar bark rings are like
those of the bear dancer, but smaller. His cry is “hup! hup!” When
returning from the woods, he does not wear hemlock, but red cedar
bark ornaments. The dancer’s name as member of the seal society is
K’@/k:aLElayu (of whom allare afraid); his qué/qutsa name is ALtsala
(coming ashore from the middle of the lake). His song is as follows:
1. There is ha’maa. We shall not live, for he is there.

2. Where he is, there is danger.

3. Where shall we hide?

4. Let us hide underground. Let us cover ourselves with dirt, for the terrible

people hide all the eagle down, the symbol of wealth,
but put it on when he enters, indicating that the salmon
brings affluence. He is greeted with the ery “haioho’.”
The amount of property distributed by the dancer’s
father is as large as that needed for initiating a ha’-
mats’a. His dance is intended to imitate the motions
of the jumping salmon. He holds his head sideways
and dances with stiff legs, the feet remaining at the
same spot, the body turning first to the right then to
theleft. His forearms are bent upward, the open palms
stretched forward. Following is his song:

1. Many salmon are coming ashore with me.

2. They are coming ashore to you, the post of our heaven.

3. They are dancing from the salmon’s country to the shore.

. I come to dance before you at the right-hand side of the world,
overtowering, outshining, surpassing all; I, the salmon.

SONG OF A SALMON DANCER.!

. The salmon came to search for a dancer.

3. You have supernatural power. Therefore the chief of the
salmon came from beyond the ocean. The people praise you,
for they cannot carry the weight of your wealth.

THE SALMON WEIR DANCE.”

The weir in the legends of the Kwakiutl is a toy of
the salmon. The salmon weir dancer is initiated by the
salmon. The dance belongs at present to the Maa/m-
tag:ila, who obtained it by marriage from the Awi’-
k-enox. The novice remains in the woods for about
one month. When he returns, he is naked. His body
is smeared with the juice of a plant, which makes it
very slippery. His cedar bark ornaments are similar
to those of the ha‘mats’a, but much smaller. The
dancer first rests on one leg, his body bent almost hori-
zontally at one side, the other leg extended to the other
side. Then he changes to the other leg, bending his
body to the other side and extending his other leg.
Here is his song:

1. I went to work at my salmon weir. When I took out the sal-
mon, their eyes were picked out by the crows.

2. (Speaking to the chief of the tide:) Stand still, chief! You
who makes the tide rise, who causes whirlpools where the
tides meet, whose skirt of seaweeds makes the tide rise.

3. (Chief of the tide says:) Cry hap! supernatural one! Cry
hap!

According to the legend, this dance belongs originally to the
Ts’E/nts’Enx'q’ald, to one of whose ancestors the chieftainess of the
Wasps appeared. There is only one person at a
time owning this dance. I obtained only one line
of the song:

WALAS’ AXA’?

The Walas’axa’ is a peculiar wolf’s dance. It belongs to the legend
of O’maxt’a/laLé (see p. 382), who obtained it by marrying the daughter
of Qawatiliqala. The Walas’axa’ is danced in
the following way: All the men of the tribe
dress in blankets and headdresses representing
the wolf. They hide behind a curtain which
stretches across the rear of the house, and when
the singers open their song, come forth from the
right-hand entrance of the curtain. There two
criers are stationed, who hold staffs and an-
nounce their arrival. As soon as a dancer ap-
pears, he turns and proceeds on a march around
the fire. The fists are held forward, the
thumbs erect (Plate 36). When the dancers
arrive in front of
the door, they

type of these masks has taken place during the last century. The teeth
of the mask (Plate 37) are made of dentalia, and
the trail is carefully worked of cedar bark.

THE LO/KOALA.

There is still another wolf dance, which is derived
from traditions of the initiation of men by the wolves.
The tradition underlying this dance is that of Mink
and the wolves. The sons
of the chief of the wolves

The Ia/k‘im (badness) is a water monster which obstructs rivers, and

AO/MALAL, OR CHIEFTAINESS DANCE.

I did not see the dance and do not know any details as regards initi-
ation, etc. I received the following description: The Ao/malat is said
to sit on a stage in front of the ma/’wiL. She has the chieftainess’s
ornaments of abalone shells in her ears and attached to her nose. She
does not move, but is merely shown behind the curtain while the people
sing her song.' It is probable that this dance is a recent introduction
from the north. In the winter ceremonial of the Tsimsshian the dancer
appears in the manner here described on a stage, and after the song
the stage is hidden again behind a curtain.

SONG OF AO/MALAL.

1. We are told that our great chief lets his daughter dance as chieftainess.

2. Great is the song of the chieftainess, great is the ha’mats’a song of the super-
natural chieftainess.

3. At the place of the great supernatural chieftainess is heard the sound of copper,
the ringing of copper.

GHOST DANCH.

I stated in Chapter VI? how the ghost dance of the L’a/sq’én6dx
originated. There are a number of traditions of similar character ex-
plaining the origin of the ceremony among various tribes. All these
traditions contain descriptions of a visit to the world of the ghosts,
which is believed to be located under our world. Then the visitor was
given the secrets of the ghost dance and other magical gifts. This
dance is a mimnical representation of a visit to the lower world.
The dancer wears the head ring and neck ring, figs. 146, 147* which
are set with skulls, indicating that the ghosts have initiated him.
Elaborate preparations are made for this dance. During the days pre-
ceding it the members of the seal society hold close watch that nobody
enters the dancing house in which they remain assembled. Then a
ditch is dug behind the fire, and speaking tubes made of kelp are laid
under the floor of the house so as to terminate in the fire. The ghost
dancer appears, led by a rope by one attendant. He goes around the
fire four times, summoning the ghosts. After he has made the fourth

1 Appendix, page 713. » He will destroy them. 5’Page 408. 4Page 497.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 483

circuit he slowly disappears in the ditch near the fire. The people try
to hold him by the rope, but apparently he sinks out of reach. Then
many voices are heard coming from out of the fire—actually the voices
of people hidden in the bedrooms who speak through the kelp tubes. It
is announced that the ghosts have taken the dancer away, who will
return after a certain number of days. When the time of his return is
at hand, another dance is held. A
carving representing a ghost is seen
to rise from out of the ground car-
rying the dancer.

SONG OF THE GHOST DANCER.!

the chief of the ghosts. Therefore I

MA/TEM.

I have told the legend of the Ma’tem in the preceding chapter.2. The
dancer, when his song is sung, appears first on the roof of the house,
perfectly naked. Five pieces of wood, which are covered with micz
and cut in the form of hexagonal prisms in the shape of quartz crytals,
are fastened along the medial line of his head. They are attached to
a thin wooden frame, which is shaped according to the curvature of the
head and hidden in the hair. The frame consists of a medial piece
which is attached to a ring and held by two crosspieces. All of these

1 Appendix, page 714. 2? Page 411,
A484 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

are given their proper shape by means of steaming. As the song pro-—
ceeds, the dancer jumps down from the roof to the top of the bedrooms
in the rear of the house, and from there to the floor. He holds his
hands close to the back of his thighs and runs with short steps around
the fire.

2. I was taken to the foot of the mountain from where the quartz came rolling down

to me.
3. It flew with me and took me to the end of the world, the cloud, the child of Ma‘tem.

The following song of the clan Ts’é/-

partly to Ma’tkm, although the connee-
tion has not become clear to me.

The Na/xnak-aqEmL wears an immense mask, the mouth of which is
made so that it can open wide. Therefore it-is also called ha‘x-ilaqam
(the yawning face). The opening mouth means that the day is yawning
when the dawn appears. A mask of this kind was among the collec-
tions at the World’s Columbian Exposition, and has been transferred
to the Field Columbian Museum. The song belonging to this mask is
as follows: !

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. A85

The opening phrase of this song means that the dancer for whom the
words of this song were modified had taken the place of her deceased
brother, who, therefore, in her had resurrected.

Finally, I will describe the dances instituted by Wina’lag-ilis, namely
the ma’maq’a, t’6’X’uit, hawi/nalaL, and a’mlala. All of these wear
ornaments of hemlock; no red
cedar bark. They are all con-
sidered war dances.

MA/MAQ’A.

The ma/maq’a, or thrower, per-
forms a dance in which he is sup-
posed to throw disease into the
people. He enters the house naked
except for a head ring, neck ring,
waistband, bracelets, and anklets of
hemlock. His hands are laid flat
to his haunches. Thus he runs with

short, quick steps around the fire, a er

then to the left. When doing so, Cat. No. 175496, U.S. N. M. Collected by F. Boas.

he is looking for his supernatural power to come to him. All of a
sudden he claps his hands together and holds the palms flat one to
the other. Thus he moves his hands somewhat like a swimmer, up
and then in a long circle forward, downward, and, drawing them close
to his body, up again. Now heis holding his supernatural power, “the
worm of the ma/maq’a,” be-
tween his palms. During all
this time he is continuing his
circuit in short, quick steps,
but he no longer looks up-
ward. Gradually he takes his
palms apart, and between them
is seen the “ ma/maq’a’s worm.”
This is either a small carved
si/siuL, or snake, or it is a stick
which is covered with bark.

; so that thedancercan lengthen
and shorten it. While the worm is thus seen to increase and decrease in
size, the ma’maq’a resumes his motions of throwing, moving the closed
palms in circles, as described above. Suddenly he seems to throw the
implement which he is holding. At once all the people stoop and hide
under their blankets. The implement has disappeared. He repeats
the performance. The second time when he throws the worm, it is

seen to fly in the air. Actually there is a second one of the same
shape as the implement that was seen in the ma/magq’a’s hands. This
is attached toa long string, which is stretched across the rear of the
house where the seal society are sitting. Two men are holding the
string, one on each side of the house, and hiddenin the bedrooms. By
pulling the rope and tightening and slackening it the worm is seen to
fly up and down and from the right to
the left. While it is flying there the
ma/maq’a moves to the right and to the
left in front of it, his hands stretched
forward, the palms upward, the elbows
to the side, always moving with short,
quick steps. I inally the flying worm
disappears and the ma’maq’a catches
it again. Then he resumes his motions
of throwing and finally seems to throw
it into himself. He almost collapses,

Ee seen to flow from his mouth and down
his whole body. This is sometimes pro-
cured by biting the inside of the cheek or by breaking a small bladder
containing blood which the dancer holds in his mouth. After pro-
longed efforts he vomits the worm. At once he is hale and well and
proceeds in his dance. Now he throws the fourth time. The worm flies
into some of the people, who at once jump up and rush toward the fire,
where they fall down lifeless.
Blood is streaming out of their
mouths. The ma/maq’a con-
tinues to dance around them,
blows upon them until finally
they are carried away like
dead. The ma/maq’a follows
them and either he or the
shaman restores them to life.
During all this ceremony the
singers beat the boards rapidly
and silently, only stopping

he has finished his dance. At the close of the dancing season the
ma/maq’a indemnifies his victims by the payment of a few blankets.
Sometimes instead of throwing the disease, he throws a harpoon head.
There are also two of these used in the ceremony. One is held and
shown by the ma/maq’a. It is a real point of a sealing harpoon. The
other has no blade, but is provided with two hooks to hook it to the
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. A87

skin. The person with whom the ma/maq’a has an understanding,
hooks this second harpoon head to his skin and opens at the same time
a small bag containing blood, which seems to flow from the wound.
Later on the ma’/maq’a pulls it out and exchanges it quickly for his own
harpoon head.

There are still other performances of the ma/maq’a, one of which
consists in throwing a number of ducks into a kettle that is filled with
water. Lam told that wooden carved ducks are tied to the bottom of
the kettle and released by a helper as soon as the ma/maq’a throws.

MA/MAQ’A SONG.!
1. Go and look everywhere for his supernatural power, for his supernatural power.
Among the La/Lasiqoala the ma/maq’a wears cedar bark ornaments
as shown in figures 151, 152, pp. 502, 503. His dance is the same as that
of the Kwakiutl ma/maq’a. Following is one of their ma/maq’a songs:!
1. Behold his great supernatural power; iii.
2. Be careful in swinging your sacred implement.

3. Truly it kills the people, so that they have no time to escape.
4. Truly the supernatural power cuts short their lives.

TO'NWUIT.

The t’o’X’uit is almost always danced by women. The dancer is
decorated in the same way as the ma/‘inaq’a. She enters singing the
t’o’X’uit ery:

FS Saree Sees

Ya ya ye ya ya yé

She holds her elbows close to her sides, the forearms forward, palms
upward. She walks around the fire limping, raising both hands
slightly with every second step, as though she was trying to conjure
something up from underground. She is followed by four attendants.
Her spirit is in most cases the si/siuL, and him she is conjuring. She
moves around the fire four times, and now the ground opens in the rear
of the house and out comes a huge si/siuL. Its horns are moving and
its tongues are playing. This carving is either raised by means of
strings which pass over the beams of the house or by men who lift it
from underneath. A carving of this sort was exhibited at the World’s
Columbian Exposition, and has been transferred to the Field Columbian
Museum. Assoon as it appears there is a great commotion in the rear
of the house so that it can not be seen very distinctly. After it has
disappeared again the singers begin its song, which is as follows: !

x Let us show what we gained by war!

2. (Wina’/lag‘ilis says:) I did not turn my face backward to look at those who were
bothering me when I went to make war on you, friend.

‘Appendix, page 715.
488 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

3. Throw your power that is killing everybody, throw your fire of death, throw what
makes them turn their faces downward, throw it against them who went to
make war upon you.

4. I surpass them, they are the lowest of the whole world.

5. I pulled them into my canoe to be my slaves, that they may bail out the war canoe.!

Another t’0/X’uit will take
a stick, a lance, or a paddle,
and, after having conjured up
the si’siuL, split it in two.
This is done with a smaller
carving, which consists of two
parts that can be separated
and joined again by means of |
strings. <A si/siuL of this kind

yas collected by Mr. Hunt for the
Anthropological Department of the
World’sColumbian Exposition, and
is now in the Field Columbian Mu-
seum. Its song, which is four gen-
erations old,is as follows :?

1. I have been on the other side of the
world, I, the great supernatural
being.

2. There I obtained all the supernatural
power.

3. I bring with me all the supernatural
power.

Still other t’?6/X’uit will conjure up

a small si/siuL, which flies through

the air like that of the ma’maq’a.

Atother times the t’0’ X’uit will suc-

ceed in bringing the si/siuL up just

far enough for its horns to show.

'This song is a modified form of an older song belonging to the Si’sintae of the
Kwakiutl. It was given this form at a time when the Nimkish had invited the
Kwakiutl to a feast. Itis aimed against the Nimkish. The references to war mean
here only the rivalry in distributions of property, and the song intimates that the
Kwakintl are superior to the Nimkish. The dancer is called ‘‘friend” because when
the song was sung first he had not received his new name yet. In line 3, ‘‘makes
them turn their faces downward,” means that the Nimkish are lying flat on the
ground and the Kwakiutl are stepping over their backs. Line 4, ‘‘the lowest of the
whole world,” means again the Nimkish, exaggerating their inferiority.

be carried all through the house by the woman who is moving under-
ground. He is plowing the floor with his arms. This is done by bury-
ing a stout rope about 8 inches below the surface and covering it with
loose dirt. The man pulls himself along this rope (see p. 604),

Still other to’ X’uit invite the people to kill them. The dancer says
“hup, hup,” moving the edge of her palm along her throat, meaning,
“Cut my neck!” or she moves the tips of the fingers of both hands
down her stomach, meaning “Open my belly!” or she moves them
along her head, shoulders, or other parts of her body. Finally, she is
placed on a seat behind the fire and one of her attendants complies
with her request. He will appear to drive a wedge through her head
from one temple. to the other. The wedge is first shown to the people
and then secretly exchanged for another one, which consists of two
parts attached to a wooden band that is slipped over her head and
covered with hair. Thus it seems that the butt is standing out on one

side, the point having passed through her skull. At the same time
bladders containing blood, which are attached to the band, are burst,
and the blood is seen to flow down her face. She also bites her cheeks
or bursts a small bag containing blood which she holds in her mouth,

her hair and let down over her own eyes when the wedge is driven in,
so that it looks as though her eyes were coming out of their sockets.
Then she rises and walks around the fire to show the wedge sticking in
her head. After one circuit she is seated again, the wedge is removed,
and she is hale and sound. On other occasions the head or shoulder
is struck with a paddle which seems to split it, and on being with-
drawn leaves a bloody line, which looks like a wound. In this case the
paddle is secretly exchanged for another one which is so notched as to
fit her head or shoulder. She walks around the fire showing it, and
then it is removed.

Other to/X’uit request their attendants to kill them with a spear.

She is seated in the rear of the house, and the spear which has been
shown to the people is secretly exchanged for another one the point of
which can be pushed into its shaft. The spear is put under the arm of
the to’ Nuit, and apparently pushed slowly into her body. As it enters,
blood is seen to flow from the wound. The blood is in this case also
kept in a small bladder, which is attached to the skin. When it seems

to have entered the full breadth of the body, the skin on the opposite
side is seen to be pushed out by the point, and blood flows also from
that point. Asa matter of fact, a hook which is attached to the hem-
lock ring on the dancer’s arm is fastened to the skin, which is pulled up
by a slow motion of the arm. At the same time the hook breaks a
bladder containing blood.

In some dances the head of the dancer is cut off, and the person who
cuts it shows a carved human head bearing the expression of death,
which he holds by its bair. These heads are as nearly portraits of the
dancer as the art of the carver will permit
(figs. 153, 154, pp. 503, 504),

Sometimes the t’o’X’uit is burnt. A
box which has a double bottom is pre-
pared for this performance. The dancer
lies down flat in the rear of the house and
the box is laid down sideways, so that
she may be pushed into it from behind.
At the place where she is lying down a HeUHiNGL Gahes ine Meni eat

the box which stands in front of her. After the pit has been covered
again, the box is raised, closed, and thrown into the fire. Before the
box is brought in, a skeleton has been put between its two bottoms.
While the box is burning, the song of the dancer is heard coming from
the fire. From the pit in which she hides a speaking tube of kelp is laid
under the floor to the fireplace, and through it she sings. When the fire
has died down, the charred bones are found in the ashes. They are col-
lected, laid on a new mat, and for
four days the people sing over
them. The mat is so placed that
it lies over the mouth of another
speaking tube. The shaman tries
to resuscitate her, and after four
days avoice is heard coming forth
Q a from the bones. Then they are
covered with amat. The woman
crawls up from out of a ditch,
into which the bones are thrown,
while she lies down in their place.
She begins to move, and when
the mat is removed, she is seen
to have returned to life. In
many of these dances, after the
performer has been killed, the

or three points on top, and mica is glued on its painting. It is intended
to represent the si/siuL, but I am not able to interpret the carving in
detail. The characteristic figure of the si/siuL certainly does not appear
on it.

Other t’0/X’uit, instead of conjuring the si/siuL, bring up the no/n-
LEmg‘ila (making foolish) (figs. 156-158),! a small human figure with
movable head and arms. It dances about, and then one or two birds
are seen to fly down from the roof and alight on its head. In fig.
158 the bird is seen sitting on the figure’s head. Fig. 159 represents
a bird which is let down by means of strings, at the same time flapping
its leather wings. Often the bird takes hold of the figure’s head and
carriesit away, to return it after a while. The face of the no/nLEmg-ila
is always painted in the same manner. It is white, and two black lines,
on to which mica is glued, run downward from the eyes. The head is
set with tufts of human hair. The figure is also worked from under-
ground. In some dances only the head of the no/nLEmgvila is used
(fig. 160, p. 510). It is worn by a
dancer who wraps a blanket over his
head and carries the head in front of
his stomach.

The La/Lasiqoala eall the t’o/X’uit olala, and have special names for
the various performances. They use ornaments of red cedar bark. The
ring of the 0‘lala is shown in fig. 161 (p. 510). The o’lala, when return-
ing from the woods, has many bloody lines on his cheek, “the rubbing
of Wind’‘lag-ilis’s canoe.” Four horizontal lines run over each cheek,
nearly reaching the nose. Above them is one just under the eyes cross-
ing the bridge of the nose, and two short vertical lines run down the
temples outside the eyes. Another painting of the 0’/lala consists of
one pair of parallel black lines running from one cheek over the upper
part of the bridge of the nose to the other cheek, and of a pair running
horizontally across the middle of the forehead. Following is one of the
0'lala’s songs :?

up so that it grows out of his mouth like the tail of a snake. His orna-
ments are shown in fig. 163 (p. 511). Following is his song:!

The people sing: How great is our famous one!
How great is his name!
The dreaded spirit is coming in his canoe!
How great is his name!
Silis sings: Do not be troubled! Do not be afraid on account of the storm
caused by my great protector.
My protector the si’/sinL goes right up to the greatest chiefs.
The people sing: How great is our famous one!
Si‘lis sings: He said to me: “You will take counsel with Wina‘lag:ilis.
He said to me: ‘‘ You will be friend to Wina’lag-ilis.
The people sing: How great is our famous one.

The A’mlala is also initiated by Wina‘lag-ilis. He is not counted as
a member of the t’0’X’uit, but performs a separate dance. His head
ring and neck ring are made of hemlock. He wears a club, the end of
which is set with long thorns (fig. 164, p. 512). After several circuits
around the fire, he presses these thorns into his head, and blood is seen

to flow freely. Then he presses them into his neck. His rings are made
of hemlock branches, in which a tube of kelpis hidden. The tube is filled
with blood. The thorns are pushed into
the kelp, out of which the blood runs over
the face and down the body.

The last of the dances, the origin of
which is ascribed to Wina/lag-ilis, is the
hawi/nalaL, the war dance. The legend
of this dance belongs to the clan Maam’-
tagrila. In the beginning of the world
there was a man named W1i/naXwina-
g-im, who was a great warrior. He wanted
to go on war expeditions all the time.
The people who desired to have peace
tied him with strong ropes. He, how-
ever, broke them without difficulty. He
held a knife in his hands, the handle of
which represented the si/sinL, and ran

people finally took hold of him again, cut errte ste:

holes through his thighs and through his back, and pulled ropes through
them. Thus they hung him onto the beam of the house and began to
sing songs which they hoped would appease him. While he was swing-
ing from the beam he still held his knife, and as he could not cut any-
one else, he cut his own head. His wounds did not hurt him; on the

contrary, he enjoyed them. After a while he became quiet. Then they
took him down. Later on, whenever he came back from war, he asked
the people to pull ropes through his back and to haul him up to the roof.
496 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

They tied to his back a si/siuL carving to which ropes were fastened,
stretched a heavy rope from the beach to the roof of his house, and
pulled him up. They carried him around
the roof and let him down again.

The performance of the hawi/nalaL is
a repetition of the deeds of this man.
When he is being initiated, he fasts in
the woods until he grows very thin.
When he comes back, he wears orna-
ments of hemlock branches. Small thin
slabs of wood carved in the shape of
paddles (fig. 165, p. 513) are sewed along
his arms and legs, across his chest, and
down his sides. Then a rope of red cedar
bark is stretched from the roof of the

ropes pulled through the holes, which are held by two men. The paint-
ing on a bedroom (Plates 40,41) shows
this very well. The hawi/nalat pulls on
the strings as hard as possible, so that his
flesh is pulled far out. He stretches his
arms backward, crying ‘ai, ai!” which
means that he desires his leader to pull
onthe ropes. Then he looks upward and
points up with his first fingers, crying
‘Cai, ai!” which means, ‘ Hang me to the

Over the door is the si/siuL being attacked by birds. To the left the crane is
represented, and below this the thunder-bird. The upper right-hand figure repre-
sents the eagle, and the lower figure on the same side the raven. Two men whom
the si/sinL has killed are shown near the bottom of the door.

Here is a song of the hawi’/nalaL:

I also give (figs. 170, 171, p. 516) the mask of the earthquake dancer
(Xoa/exoe). He wears a rattle consisting of a ring on which perforated
shells are strung (fig. 172, p. 516). His dance is believed to shake the

After the mask has disappeared, the people sing: !

It may be that the following song belongs to the same mask: !

1. Aia haia! Sing Haialik-alaL, sing winter dance songs, great supernatural spirit!

2, Aia haia! Then the people will ask you to fulfill their desires, great supernatural
spirit.

3. Aia haia! Then they will take the cedar bark ornaments out of your hair, great
supernatural spirit.

4, Aia haia! Then they will ask you to give them plenty to eat, great supernatural
spirit.

The dance Hai/alik-auaé of the various tribes belongs here, but I have
not been able to collect any of the songs belonging to it. Figs. 173-177
(pp. 517-520) show the ornaments of the Kwakiutl dancer; figs. 178-
180 (pp. 521-523), the ornaments of Hai’alik-auaé of the Nimkish; and
fig. 181, p. 524, the L’a’sq’énox.

The ring of the shaman (fig. 182) is figured on page 525.

The La/Lasiqoala embrace all those who are for the first time initiated
as winter dancers in one group, who are called wa/tanEm, the lowest
grade of the winter dance societies. Their head ring is shown in fig.
183 (p. 525).

The same type of ring, but somewhat larger, is used by the chief of
the killer whale society of the Kwakiutl (fig. 184, p. 526).

Following is a wa/tanEm song:?

1. You do not go into Wina/lay‘ilis’ canoe, you who are known every where.

2. You do not go into Wina’lag:ilis’ canoe, you whose name is known everywhere.
3. You, who will be feared by all the supernatural beings

4, You, great one, who will be feared by all the supernatural beings.

The head ring worn by the qué’qutsa is shown in fig. 185 (p. 527),
When a person is to be initiated for the first time, he receives among
the Kwakiutl the rings shown in figs. 186, 187 (pp. 527, 528).

It remains to give alist of the dances according to their rank. There
are many among them, about which I have no further information than
that contained in the following list. I also give the number of songs
which belong to each dancer, his whistles, and secret songs, which are
sung by the dancer himself. This order has reference, of course, only
to the Kwakiutl proper:

1. Awi'/loLlaL, four songs; four whistles; secret song. Hemlock rings. (Dancers
who have acquired ha/mats’a, hai‘alik-ilaL, t’o’X’uit. )

2. Ha’mats’a, eight songs; four whistles. Red cedar bark.

3. Ha’mshamtsEs, two songs. Red cedar bark.

4. No/ntsistalai, four songs; two whistles. Red and white cedar bark. (Obtained

The classification and order of dances varies considerably among the

Kwakiutl, Ma/maléleqala, Nimkish, and Law‘itsis.
500 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The Ts’a/watEenox, Guau’/aéndx, Haxua/mis, T’Ena’xtax, and A‘wai-
LEla have the following order so far as I have been able to learn:

1. Ma’maq’a.

2. Ha'mats’a.

3. Hai/aq’antElaL (speaker dance).

4, Hawe’/xaqulaL, who induces chiefs to destroy property, coppers, etc.
5. Walas’axa/aL.

6. Haua/‘iadalat (a fool dance).

Among the Koskimo, G:0’p’enox, L’a/sq’énox, and Gua/ts’éndx the
t’o/X’uit is first in rank. Next is the ma/maq’a, and then follows the
ha‘mats’a.

The La/Lasiqoala, Naqd/mg-ilisala, Na’qoaqtoq, and Goasi/la do not
include all the dances enumerated above in the winter ceremonial
(ts’e/ts’aeqa). A large number, particularly the fool dancers, the hawt’-
nalaL, and all the animals, are included in a ceremonial called 10/nLEm,
which is neither ba‘xus (secular or profane) nor sacred. Songs belonging
to both seasons are used in this ceremonial. I shall discuss this cere-
monial more fully later on (Chapter XII, p. 621). The number of mem-
bers of the ts’é’ts’aeqa is consequently small. They are arranged in
the following order, beginning with the highest:

1. Ma’maq’a.

2. Ha'mats’a.

3. Ha/mtsretsoe. Thisisa ha/mats’a whois not taken away by BaxbakualanuXsi’ wae,
but only dreams of him. Consequently his initiation is performed in the
house. He has neither the ha’mats’a cry (hap) nor the ha’/mshamtsrs cry
(hwip). Hissong has words only. His badges are like those of the ha‘mats’a,

4, Ts’e’kois.

5. Ts’e/koa’ta.

6. H-ai/alik-auae.

7. Olala (corresponding to the t’6’X’uit).

8. Lolo’/talan.

9. YiaiatalaL, or Q’O’minoqisaL.

10. Pa’/xalalaL, shaman dance.

11. Wa‘tanrm. These are the novices who have just entered the ts’é’ts’acqa. After
the ha’mats’a has been initiated four times he is wa’‘tankm—that means,
pulled ont of the dancing house. He becomes a que/qutsa. During this
transitional period he is waLaweé, i. e., wa’‘tanEm ina transitionalstage. When
a ba’xus offends the q’a‘q’anas, which include the above dancers, he is made
wa‘tankem. He dances in four houses and becomes a novice. The following
year he will be initiated in one of the higher societies.

IX. THE WINTER CEREMONIAL OF THE KWAKIUTL.

I can now proceed to describe the ceremonial at which all these
dancers perform their ceremonies. Generally it is connected with the
refund of the purchase money for a wife, the qauté’x-a, as described on
page 421.

J will describe first the great ceremonial which is the same for all the
laxsa, but most elaborate for the initiation of a ha/mats’a. The whole

ceremonial is in charge of a master of ceremonies, whose name is
Nia’‘xnemis and LE/mwala, while his profane name is O/mx’it; the win-
ter name of his speaker is Ho/LElité. A number of further officers

will be described in the course of this chap-
ter. All these officers and the names of the
officers derive their origin from a myth telling
‘how the animals held their first winter cere-
monial. Ishall relate the myth later on (page
538). Plate 42 represents the present master
of ceremonies and his speaker.

At the time of marriage the bride’s father
has promised to transfer his membership in
one of the secret societies to one of his son-
in-law’s children. When a son of the latter
has reached the age of 10 or 12 years, or even
earlier, he is initiated in one of the lower
secret societies, through which he must

the ha‘mats’a
society. As soon as he is entitled to
become a member of this society, his
father invites the three principal chiefs
of the tribe to his house and informs
them that he desires his father-in-law
to make his son a member of the secret
society. The celebration of this event
is exceedingly expensive, and for this
reason the three chiefS investigate the
debts and the property of the man and
of his father-in-law, in order to make
sure that they can meet the expenses in-
cidental to the ceremonies. If they find
the amount of property sufficient, they
give permission for the celebration of
the festival. In this case they order the
father to invite all the chiefs of the tribe
to meet on, the fourth day. When they
assemble, the three head chiefs inform
the young chiefs of the plan, and the
latter give their consent.

At this meeting, the man who gives

the dance notifies his father-in-law that he desires to have the blankets
which he paid for his wife returned, and that he wants to have the box:
containing his father-in-law’s dance.
502 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Then the chiefs order the man to invite the whole tribe to a meeting
which is to be held four days later. The three head chiefs inform the
tribe, in a speech made in a low voice, of their intention to hold a winter
dance, and the young chiefs request all to prepare themselves for this
festival. In particular, they are asked to clean themselves, and to
refrain from intercourse with women, as the spirit Wina/lag‘ilis, who has
his home in the north, but dwells among the Indians during the dancing
season, dislikes people who are unclean, or such as have had inter-
course with women. The young man who is going to give the winter
ceremonial is called the ye’-
wix'ila.

At this meeting, the father-
in-law calls one of his speak-
ers, who must step into the
middle of the house, holding a

Bie; Lele: pole, which is from 6 to 8 feet
pone yet enn long. It is called the winter-

eae The speaker delivers a
speech, in which he sets forth the amount of property represented by
the pole, and announces the intention of the father-in-law to give it to
the young man. He asks the latter to step up to the pole and touch it,
as a sign of acceptance. The whole assembly join in this demand, and
the young man, accompanied by a chief—who is paid for this service
later on—steps up to the pole. The chief who speaks for the young
man asks the father-in-law what the pole represents, and the latter’s
speaker sets forth once more the amount of property, such as blankets,
copper bracelets, food, and grease, which is to be used in the dance.

Fig. 151.

IV A, No. 6864, Royal Ethnographical Museum, Berlin. Collected by F. Boas.

Then the chief representing the young man takes the pole, lays it over
his shoulder, and runs around the fire, stooping and crying, ‘‘ Whoo!
whoo! whoo!” The meaning of this action is that the weight of the
property represented by the pole is too heavy for him to carry. Then
he sings the following song:!

The Spirit of the Winter Dance came down,

The Spirit of the Winter Dance came down and stays here with me.

Then the master of the ceremonies rises and orders everyone to
bathe early in the morning for four days before the crows begin to ery,

and thus to prepare to meet Wina‘lag-ilis. At this time the winter-
dance whistles are heard for the first time. These whistles represent
the voices of the spirits of the winter dance. When first heard, they
appear to be far away from the house in a northerly direction. The
second time they come nearer the
house, and thus they are heard four
times, nearer and nearer. ‘This in-
dicates that the spirit approaches
the village from the north. Finally,
the whistles of the spirit of the
cannibal society are heard near the
house. Then the sound is heard on
the roof and moves around it four
times. At this time the son of the
man who gives the festival suddenly
disappears (x-is’e’t), and a few min-
utes later he is heard to ery in the
woods “hap, hap, hap,” the sound
which is ascribed to the cannibal
spirit BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. The
master of ceremonies asks the people

young man to his house to initiate him in the cannibal ceremonies. To
this the master of ceremonies replies that after four days the people
are to assemble again, to receive the orna-
ments of cedar bark. He asks them to sing
their summer songs during this time, to use
their summer names, and to make merry, be-
cause as soon as the four days are over they
will be forbidden to use their summer names
and to sing their summer songs. On the fol-
lowing morning when the crows begin to cry,
everybody, young and old, takes a bath in
the sea. They rub their bodies with hemlock
branches, in order to clean themselves prepara-
tory to the advent of the spirit Wina‘lag:ilis.

following day. They receive in payment a button blanket from the
master of ceremonies, which is not returned. Their offices are not
hereditary. Persons who have good voices are selected to act as
messengers. They carry in their hands staffs about 8 feet long.
504 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

When they come to a house, they open the door and invite the people,
the women first, one of the inmates of the house prompting the
speaker. When they call the names, they stand in the door and strike
the threshold with their staffs.' After the women, the ha/mats’a is
called, and then the other men, the qué’quts’a last. Then the speaker
of these twelve men says,’ “Is that all?” The people reply,’ “ That is
all.” Then they call a certain relative of the master of ceremonies who
has the name Ts’ix-ii/xtolsE’las.4 All the property given away by the
master of ceremonies is given in honor of this relative, who consequently
is of high rank. Heor she receives this name anew every year. After
the messengers have called the people by their winter names, they are
not allowed to use their summer names again until the ceremonies are
ended.

By this time the people begin to ar-
range themselves in groups, which are _
divided according to sex andage. These
take the place of the clans, as described
before.

On the following morning before day-
light, the same twelve men visit all the
houses and call to everybody: “ Don’t
sleep! Go and bathe in the sea. We
are walking around again to call you.”®

Then they go to the house of the mas-
ter of ceremonies, which is called the assembly house." The house has
been prepared for this purpose. A heavy cedar plank has been laid
along the rear wall of the house, and another one along each side.
These are used for beating time. The door is surrounded by a ring of
hemlock branches which is covered with eagle down, so that everyone
who steps into the house must pass through it. When passing through
it, the people turn to the left, step through it with the right foot first,
and then turn again.

The members of the seal society’ do not enter the house, but assem-
ble in another house. During this day the people sing and make merry
until after dark. Then the master of ceremonies rises and calls four
officers to go and invite the seal society. These offices are hereditary,
and the men who perform the ceremonies have certain names which

'They say, laqoisexai’ (follows the name).

of the Walas Kwakiutl tribe; Loxsa’, of the Ha/ialik-auaé clan, and
A’‘LOo’'lsEla, of the Q’o‘moyué tribe. The last is their leader. They are
called pii/paxameé (head paxalas). One of these men must be a “ paxala”
(shaman). When starting each takes a round rattle. They blacken
their faces, put on their head rings and neck rings of red cedar bark,
and cover their heads with eagledown. Then their speaker, A/LO’lsEla,
says, ‘We are going to fetch our friends.”! Then they go around the
fire four times, singing as follows:?
O friend, O friend, O supernatural friend (meaning Wina’‘lag‘ilis).

Then they go to the house in which the seal society is waiting for
them. Meanwhile, the master of ceremonies calls up four other officers
to invite the highest members of the seal society, the ha’/mats’as. These
offices are also hereditary. The names of the officers are: K:a/qauLéx,
of the Kué’xa tribe; Mé’goatExstala, of the same tribe; K-éx-, of the
Maa/’intag-ila clan; and Na/wulqalag-ilis, of the Kue’xa tribe. The first
three names are qué/qutsa names, the last is a ha/mshamts’ES name,
He is the leader of these four messengers. They are also called pii/pa-
xamné (head paxala), and there must be one “ paxala” (shaman) among
them.

The master of ceremonies gives them tallow. The ha/mshamts’ES
puts some of it into his mouth, chews it, and then rubs it all over his
face, while the others simply rub it on their faces without chewing.
Each is also given a cedar bark ring, charcoal, feathers, and a round
rattle. They all wear que’qutsa rings. After they have received the
ornaments, they say, ‘* We will go and fetch our great friends.”> They
walk four times around the fire, singing :+*

You said, Wina/lag-ilis, that I should capsize in rough weather. Your friend

stayed here long in my canoe near the beach. You said that I should capsize in
rough weather, but your friend capsized sleeping while it was rough weather.®

Then they walk around the fire, go on their errand, and after about
fifteen minutes the eight men who were sent to fetch the seal society
and the ha’mat’sas return, and A/LO’IsEla sings:°

BaxbakualanuXsi’waé told me about the great supernatural means of killing people

*This song refers to a man named Eix’ag‘ida’lag‘ilis who met Wini/lag‘ilis. The
latter asked him: “Are you a shaman?” He replied in the affirmative, and con-
tinued: ‘Can you cross here without upsetting your canoe?” “Yes,” retorted
Wina'lag‘ilis. ‘Then let me see,” said the former. “If you suceeed, I will cross
next.” When Wina/lag‘ilis tried to cross, he capsized. Then Fix’’ag-ida’lag-ilis
sang the above song. A translation is very difficult, and the sense is by no means
certain.

506 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The four men who went to fetch the seal society enter first. Those
who went to fetch the ha/mats’as follow them. Before they enter, the
people who are assembled in the house clear their throats, as they are
not allowed to cough or to laugh after the seal society have entered.
When the messengers enter, A/Lo’lsEla says, “Our friends are coming.”!

Now Nawulqa‘lag-ilis says, ‘Take care,
our great friends are coming.””

Then the four men who called the seals sit
down in the left-hand front corner of the
house, the others in the right-hand front
corner. Now everybody looks at the door
where the fool dancers (n00‘nLEmaLa) enter
first. They strike the door with their swords

Their faces are blackened, they wear torn and
soiled clothing. Their heads are strewed
with eagle down. If anyone laughs or
coughs, the fool dancer steps up to him and
threatens him with his sword or lance. Then
the fool dancers turn one by one, go to the
right around the fire, and sit down on their
seats. Their places are at both ends of those
of the seal society, as they are the guards
of the society. Then all the other mem-
bers of the society enter, each group by
themselves, and each dressed in their proper
ornaments of red cedar bark. They stand
in the doorway for a short time, and then
go to their places, turning to the right and
going around the fire. The ha/mats’as are
the last to enter. They are preceded by the
grizzly bear dancers, whose faces are black-
ened. They wear blankets, and bear claws
on their hands. If there happens to be an
odd number of these, one of their number

forming two rows, one on each side of the
door. Now the ha/mats’as enter and pass between the two rows of bear
dancers, which close behind. The ha’mats’as step up to the fire and,
standing side by side, face the rear of the house. There they stand for
about ten minutes, during which time nobody is- allowed to move.
Then the master of ceremonies rises and makes a speech in a very low
voice, in which he warns the people to be careful and not to offend
the ha‘/mats’as. The latter turn to the right and walk ses to the rear

of the house, holding their blankets in a fold over their arms, which are
held at some distance from their chest. If any one coughs after the
ha/mats’as have entered, the bear steps up to him and threatens him.
The offender must give a feast to the seal society; sometimes also to
the qué/qutsa. The ha’mats’as sit down in the middle of the rear of the
house. Next to them on both sides sit the bear dancers; next to these
the other groups of the seal society. Then
the master of ceremonies asks the four mes-
sengers who went to invite the members of the
lower grades of the seal society to fetch tallow
and white cedar bark. The four men rise
together and A’/LO’lsEla says: ‘We go to lift
our grandfather from the floor.”!

All the ceremonial objects which are ac-
quired by inheritance are called ‘grand-
father.” They are kept in four boxes in the
right-hand front corner of the house. When
the men lift them, the ts’a’eqa spirits enter
them, making them hungry. This is ex-
pressed in their song, which they sing while
walking around the fire and carrying the
boxes containing the tallow and cedar bark :”

This is what makes us confused.

They carry these boxes four times around
the fire and then stop in frontof the ha/mats’as,
to whom they give sometallow and cedar bark.
They continue to distribute it, two men going
tothe right and two going to the left until they
meet at the door.

Then the master of ceremonies calls the same
messenger who went to fetch the ha/mats’as:
“Come, friends, and lift from the floor your
grandfather.” *

They rise, walk around the fire four times,
and, standing close to the door, the speaker
says, ‘Weare going, friends, to lift our grand-

father,”* which means in this case the drum. Saas ‘

They remain standing near the doorway, then turn to the right and
go four times around the fire, and put down the drum. <As soonas they
do so, the small (ts’e’/tsaéqa) winter dance whistles are heard to blow.
The men say, ‘ That is a good sign for us, friends.”!

The master of ceremonies next calls the four men who called the seal
society, saying, ‘Come, friends, go and fetch our batons.”? They do
not reply, but begin to sing their secret song, going around the fire four
times and swinging their rattles:*

I am the only one who owns the winter dance.

They walk out of the
house and continue to sing
until they come back, car-
rying the batons on their
leftarms. They goaround
the fire and put the batons
down in front of the people,
beginning with the ha’-
mats’as, and continuing on
both sides until they reach
those who sit nearest the
door.

Then the master of cere-
monies calls upon the four
men who fetched the ha/-
mats’as, saying, ‘‘Come,
friends, take up our red
cedar bark here.”* They

Then they walk out singing, and come back singing the same song
and carrying the red cedar bark under their Jeft arms. They bring it
in a long bunch, about 12 feet in length and more than a foot thick.
One man carries it in front, two in the middle, one at the end. They
carry their rattles in their right hands. On entering, they turn round

together so that the cedar bark makes a full turn, go round the fire to
the right, and turn again in the rear of the fire. Thus they go around
the fire four times. They stop in the right-hand front corner of the house.

The master of ceremonies now proceeds to prepare the floor of the
house for the ceremonies, or ‘‘to put the naualak into the floor.” He
gives slow jerks downward with his round rattle, say-
ing with each movement, ‘‘Op,” and stooping down to
the floor. This is the song of Hai‘alik-auae, the first
shaman. Thus he goes around the fire once, and then
he sings his secret song:!

After he has finished his song, Na/wulqalag-ilis
stretches his hand backward, and somebody puts,
unnoticed, a knife into it. This he gives to the
master of ceremonies, who steps up to the four
men who hold the cedar bark. Three times he pre-
tends to cut it, and after each cut makes one turn to

lowed by the four men, who carry the

dishes with down. In the rear and in the front of the fire they all

turn once. Then the master of ceremonies
returns the dish to the four men and orders
them to distribute the feathers: ‘‘Go and
feather our great friends.”?

The men begin again with the ha/mats’a
and feather the heads of the people, begin-
ning in the middle and proceeding toward
both ends. Then they distribute tallow and
batons in the same way.

Now the master of ceremonies puts on his

head ring, which consists of a flat strip of

cedar bark, to which a long trail of the same
materialis attached. Again he sings his se-
cret song and goes around the fire four times
swinging the rattle, which he holds approxi-
mately at the height of his head. During
this song the people bend their heads down
and move on their seats in order to gain a
convenient position. They hold their batons
ready for use. After the master of ceremo-
nies has gone around the fire four times, he
stops in front of the ha/mats’as and says

signal the people look up and begin to beat the boards for about ten
minutes, during which time the master of ceremonies shakes his rattle.

Then he swings the rattle in a wide circle, thus giving a signal for the
people to stop. During the following minutes not a sound is heard
except from the shamans, who utterfrom time to time the sound ‘“h,h,”
deep from the throat. This means that they are watching to see if the
people make a mistake or transgress any of the rules. After about ten
minutes the master of ceremonies gives a new signal for the people to beat
the boards. After ten minutes more they stop again. Then everyone

begins to sing his own secret song, all at the same time, which is a sign
that the spirit of the winter dance has entered the house. Then all the
qué’qutsa divide according to their societies.

After this the master of ceremonies gives another signal and all the
men begin to beat the boards again as hard as possible and at the same
time the bear dancers utter their cries. The fool dancers are heard to ery
‘twai! hai! hai!” throwing stones and swinging their swords and lances
at the same time. The master of ceremonies gives a new signal, and
all the people stop at once beat-
ing the boards. Then the bear

all the ha/mats’as, bears, and fool dancers rise and drive the people
before them. While they are doing so they take hold of a child of
the second ye/wix-ila; the child drops his cedar bark ornaments and
blankets and disappears in the woods. Then the members of the
Seal society go out of the house followed by the people. Now the

batons among them. At the same time trumpet whistles are heard to
blow in his bedroom. When the people have assembled in his house,
the master of ceremonies says, ‘Let us try, friends, to drive away the
supernatural being. He has carried away enough of our number.”!
The people reply, “‘Come, friend, no one is stronger in
supernatural power than you are.”” Then all the other

VY men say one after the other, ‘Let us go on the floor

iV children) get ready to sing the old song which is sup-

posed to drive the spirits away. They cry “ye heee
hu hu hu ye heee!” This is the song of the wolf.
After this song the master of ceremonies says, ‘That
is wrong.”! Now they utter the bear’s cry: ‘‘ Hamama
ma ma, hamamai.” Again he says, ‘That is wrong.”
The people next utter Hai‘alik-auae’s sound, “ wo-ip
kf w6-ip kf w6-ip” (kf blown upward). They continue
this for about five minutes. The whistles continue to
blow, and the master of ceremonies says again, ‘‘ That
is wrong! Thatis wrong! Let us sing another song.”

Just before the end, the master of ceremonies joins the chorus, crying
“oO hu,” and all the people shout “wa!” hitting the boards together,
which is believed to be a means of driving away the spirits. This song
is sung four times. Then the speaker of the second yé/wix‘ila says:
“Friends, be happy. I received the name t—— from the supernatural
being.” &

Then all the people reply: ‘‘ You received your great name from the
supernatural being.”? After this the speaker continues, saying that

have I been made by the supernatural being. I shall give dried

In this feast he gives a new name to his relative who had been taken

according to the societies enumerated above, go to every house, and
keep on feasting and singing until morning.

During this time the ha/mats’as are in a state of excitement, and
occasionally bite some of the people. On the following morning the

meal until they have learned that the ha/mats’as have eaten. For the
whole dancing season this rule must be adhered to.

During all this time the father-in-law of the first yé/wix-ila has been
gathering all his property, principally food, blankets, boxes, dishes,
spoons, kettles, bracelets, coppers, and box lids, in order to refund
(qauté’x-a) to his son-in-law the amount promised at the marriage of
his daughter (see p. 421).

When he assembles his clan to announce his plans, the members of
the seal society must not come. This is the only time when the clans
are recognized during the winter season. He informs the people what
amount of property he is going to give to his son-in-law, what names he
is going to have, and how many songs he has had made for him. The
son-in-law assembles his clan
in the dancing house (lObEK*),
and lets them paint their
faces with charcoal. Mean-
while the canoe of g-1/sExstala
is built, as described on p.
422. All the speakers’ staffs
which are carried at the fes-
tival are ornamented with red
cedar bark. The dances that
are sung all belong to the
winter dance, only ha/mats’a
songs are not used. When
the daughter of the father-in-
law dances, she is also dressed
in cedar bark ornaments.

monial will be found at the

father-in-law calls the master
of ceremonies and, pointing to the box containing the winter dance
implements—masks, whistles, and ornaments of red cedar bark—he
says, ‘‘Come, I am afraid of this box here; you are the only one who is
not afraid of it, because you went through the whole ceremonies of the
winter dances.’ To this the inaster of ceremonies, who carries a small
cane, replies, ‘Let me go there. Yes, your word is good, friends.

It is good that you say I am the highest among you.”' With this he
lifts the box, hides it under his blanket, and begins to sing his secret
song, as follows: ?

O friend, O friend, O supernatural friend.

Then he calls the son-in-law, saying, ‘Stand up; it may be that this
box is intended for you.”* The young man rises and replies, ‘ Hold it
awhile until I dress up.”* Then he goes to the house, and after a few
minutes returns without blanket, having his face blackened. He pre-
sents himself to the master of ceremonies: ‘‘ Here I am, friend;”* who
asks him once more to be ready: ‘‘Go on, get ready, son-in-law.”®
Then he gives him the winter names which belong to the contents of the
boxes. He receives both the mé/emgoat name and also the queé/qutsa
name. He asks him to step near.* The young man turns to the left
and walks slowly down to the beach where the master of ceremonies is
standing. The latter takes his neck ring off and, holding it, sings his
secret song:

1. My mind is not strong enough (to lift it).
2. My mind is afraid of it.
3. I have seen the winter ceremonial.®

Then he turns around and gives the young men the neck ring to
which the arm rings and leg rings are tied. He turns again and takes
off his head ring. The young man’s wife, who stands next to the master
of ceremonies, gives her dancing apron to the latter, who turns once
and puts it onto her husband. Last of all, he gives him the box.
Then the master of ceremonies says “hop op” four times. (This is
the sound of Hai/alik-auae). The master of ceremonies continues :”

‘Wait a while, son-in-law, you have no name for your k-i/nqalaLala,
but I have seen what carried away our son. Her name is ———.”
With this he secretly puts a whistle into the hand of the son-in-law.

unseen to the songs, as they must dance to them when they first appear
in the house. The people sit arranged in a square. At some distance
from each corner a fool dancer is placed, to watch that no uninitiated
person comes near. If, nevertheless, one of these should see what is
going on he is captured by the fool dancer, taken into the square, and
he is initiated.

After all have learned the new songs, they scatter and go home singly
in order not to attract the attention of the other people. Each family
takes supper alone, then they get ready for the dance. When it gets
dark, the yé’wix-ila sends four messengers to invite the people to the
dance. He gives each of these
a button blanket, a head ring
and a neck ring of red cedar
bark, and eagle down to strew
on their heads. They walk out
of the house to one end of the
village and go into the door of
the last house, in order to invite
the people. Each of them has
a set speech. The first says,
“Let us try shamaps!” The
second, ‘* We shall try in vain
to bring back what makes us
remember our friends!” The
third, “Bathe, G’épLalai!

the whole village, they return to the house of the yée/wix‘ila saying:

Then the yé’wix-ila asks four other people to act as his messengers.
Again he gives each a button blanket, a head ring and neck ring of red
cedar bark, and eagle down for the head. They go to all the houses and
invite the people to come at once. They go to each house and say,
‘Walk back.”!

As soon as the people begin to enter the house, the yé/wix:ila beats
time on a board, in quick measures, concluding with a sharp rap and

the call, ‘‘hai, hai.”

After the Koskimo have entered, the maa/mx’énOx come in. Pieces
of board representing dorsal fins are attached to their backs. They
carry wreaths of hemlock branches in their hands. Their arms are
stretched back and they make the motions of swimming, blowing from
time to time like whales. They drop their wreaths in the rear of the
house, go out again, take their fins off, and reenter. Then the people
beat time, and the maa’/mx’end6x, holding their blankets stretched out
backward, enter. They take up their wreaths, and call the name of the
copper or other property that they are going to give away. Then they

throw the wreaths into the fire. This means that they are going to rival
the other tribes in the amount of property that they will give away.

The wives of the Koskimo, the qau’qotsaxsEm (?), are the next to enter.
Each of them carries a number of sticks, which represent the amount
of property which they are going to give to their husbands. Each
says what amount of property these sticks represent. They are fol-
lowed by the qa/qao and k-e’k-exalaqa, the wives of the maa/mx’enox.
-They also carry sticks and state how much property they are going to
give away.

Last of all the mEse’q, or Sea-egg, enters. Sharp sticks about 3 feet
long are fastened to his clothing. Two men accompany him. When
he comes to the rear of the house, all the sticks are pulled out from his
clothing, and at the same time the
names of all the coppers which were
given away during the past year
are called. Everyone who has given
away blankets has one stick con-
tributed to the ornaments of this
peculiar dancer. The sticks are then
thrown into the fire, while all sing
out, “ye!”

the singers slip out singly through

the secret door. Then suddenly they all reenter the house with great
noise, and the people say: “The great maa/mx’éndx have become
excited.”! They go around the fire slowly, holding their blankets
spread out. Sometimes they are led by one of the mée/émqoat. Then
they pretend to pursue the latter.*. If the member of the seal society
should happen to be a fool dancer, they endeavor to hit his nose, and
as soon as they succeed in doing so he gets excited and stabs the
people. During all this time the singing master remains in his place.

524 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

After the singers have rearranged themselves in the rear of the fire,
two of their number are sent to the door. Each has a rattle. They
are the heralds who announce the dances which are to be performed
that night in order to bring about the return of the novice. When
the singers and the members of the seal society are in their places, the
people slip out singly and return to perform their dances. On this
evening they do not show the highest dances which they possess, but
those which they owned when they were children. On the whole the
lower grades of dances come in first, the higher ones later on, but there
is no strict order. As soon as one of them approaches the house, the
heralds shake their rattles, and upon this signal the singers begin to
beat the boards rapidly, and continue to do so during the dance, at the
eud of which they sing one song of the dancer. The character of these
dances was described in the preceding
chapter.

When about one-half of all the dances
have been shown, and particularly after
a dance that has been well performed, two
messengers (ho/Laq’is, listeners) are sent
out by the speaker of the master of cere-
monies to listen if nosign of the ha’mats’a’s
nk os return can be heard. They go out, listen,
iS aie

dM and come back saying that they have not
heard anything.
While the people are waiting for the
dancers to come in, railleries are going
Fig. 181. on. The speaker of the yée/wix-ila sends

BCE dancer) and see if he has not washed.”!
Cat. No, 175522, U. S.N.M. Collected by F. Boas

The herald goes out, after turning in the
door. When he comes back, and the next dancer is to be a woman, he
may say: “She will not come; she is fighting with her husband ;” or,
“She will not come; she and her husband are kissing each other.”
The dances continue until early. in the morning, when the ghost
dancer appears. As soon as the people sing his song, all the old
ha/mats’as, who have not entered the house so far, get excited, their
whistles are blown by the hé/lig:a, and they enter the house from all
sides—through the roof, through the front door, and through the secret
doors in the rear of the house. They jump down on the floor, squat,
and, looking up, cry ‘‘hap hap!” They jump around the fire four times,
looking up and crying “hap!” all the time. Their cries are supposed
to be heard by the novice in the woods, who is heard all of a sudden
on the roof of the house. He runs around four times. Three times
he panna the boards of the roof aside, and then he ese down. The

people surround him and try to hold him. He runs around the fire
four times, but all of a sudden he has disappeared again, having made

his exit through the secret door in the rear of the
house. Only the hemlock branches with which he
was adorned remain in the house. As soon as the
people see that he has disappeared, they say that
somebody has made a mistake which angered the
ha/mats’a and caused him to leave the house again.

Not always is the ha’mats’a induced to return in
the manner described here. Sometimes the xoa/exoeé
dances and the earthquake that is thus produced
brings him back, or the dance of the t’0/X’uit may
bring him back.

In some instances a particular officer, the Lelé/L’-
alenox, must try to call the novice. Heis considered
the chief of all the que’qutsa. He wears a rough
head ring and neck ring of red cedar bark which is
twisted four times. His face is blackened. He enters

carrying a baton and stops in front of the fire. If

anyone should laugh, he points at him, and the per-
son who is-thus singled out must look downward.
He goes around the fire singing his secret song, as
follows:!
Ah, ah, supernatural power! Ah, ah, ah, supernatural
power! Hoo!

In the rear of the house he turns once, cries “hu!”
and stoops down to listen. Then he continues his
circuit and repeats this action in front of the house.
While he is doing so the ha’mats’a appears on
the roof, in the rear right hand corner of the house,

runs around the roof, and opens a hole on the left hand front corner
and looks down into the house. From here he rushes to the rear left

corner of the house.

Then he runs to

the rear right corner, and to the front
right corner, pushes the boards aside,
and looks down into the house. Then
the people take a number of blankets,
spread them out tight, and hold them
under the place where the ha/mats’a is
looking down. Finally he jumps down
into the blankets in the front right cor-
ner of the house. They try to hold him,

and slowly go around the fire trying to lay their hands upon him, but
he disappears again. Only his hemlock branches are left in the hands

of the people.

' Appendix, page 724,

526 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Then the LEIlé@/L’alenox says that the laughing of the person whom
he pointed out in the beginning was the cause of the disappearance
of the ha/mats’a. The laugher must call his daughter to dance,
and he must take a staff (the feast pole qa‘sop’eq) in his hands and
promise to give a feast after her dance.

If any other mistake should have been
made, the LEIé’L’alénox points it out in a
similar way. When, for instance, a woman
has brought her uninitiated children into
the house, he will say on entering, ‘‘ I smell
someone who is profane;”! and the people
will reply, ‘“‘Important is your word.”’
Then he asks for red cedar bark, which
is given to him. He makes a neck ring
and a head ring (figs. 186, 187, pp. 527,
528). He asks one man to beat time.
Then he sings his secret song, and sud-
denly the voices of birds (whistles) are
heard on top of the house. He holds the
red cedar bark in front of his face, push-
ing it forward with every step and crying,
“6, 0, Op, Op.” Then he puts the cedar
bark on the child’s head. The birds’ voices
suddenly disappear, and are heard on the
roof of the house of the child’s father.
Then that child must disappear, it being
supposed that he has been taken away by
these spirits.

After the novice has disappeared again,
the chief’s speaker asks all the people to
make themselves ready to expect the nov-
ice on the following morning. All this
time his whistles are heard in the woods.

The k-i‘nqalaLala lead the way, each singing her secret song. All the
people follow them toward the beach. The first k-i/nqalaLala sings:!

Yiya ham yiyaha. I pull the red cedar bark from BaxbakualanuXsi’waé’s back.

Then the second one sings:!

They go westward, and as soon as they come to the place called
Nau/alak’uas (place of supernatural power), about one-eighth of a mile
west of the village, four sons or
relatives of the ye/wix‘ila are sent
out to gather hemlock branches.
During this time the singers sing
the new songs which were made
on the preceding day in the woods,
in order to enable the other people
to learn these songs. Now, the
boys return, bringing the hemlock

the other members of the seal society go before them. Then all of a
sudden the new ha/‘mats’a appears, and is surrounded by the people,
but he disappears again. It is not the novice himself who appears at
this time, but some other man who looks like him, and who while being

people catch him and lead him toward the house, singing the new
songs. (Plate 44.) The he’lig-a sing their secret songs, and the unini-
tiated ery “hoi’p.” By this means they attempt to tame the ha/mats’a.
The people lead him to the house of the yé/wixila, who, on their
approach, steps out of the house with his whole family, dressed in red
cedar bark ornaments and button blankets. Their faces are marked
with biack spots. Their heads are covered with down. They dance in
front of the house, accompanying the new songs. Some of the ye’wi
x‘ila’s relatives go down to the people, who lead the ha‘mats’a, and
hold boards in their hands for the people to beat time on. Then the
latter begin to sing as follows: ‘‘Woe! you are making your parents
poor, naualak!”' Then they walk into the house. After they have all
entered, the new k-i/nqalaLala who returned with the ha/mats’a from
the woods, and who, during the
ceremony, is entirely naked, be-
gins to sing her new song. She
enters the house going backward,

desires to lead into the house.
The ha/mats’a, however, is appar-
ently unwilling to enter, and stays
for about half an hour in the door,
where heturns four times, the hé’-
lig’a surrounding him all the
time. During this time the peo-
ple raise the ha/msp’éq and the
ma/‘wiL. As soon as it is com-
pleted, the ha/mats’a leaves the
door, goes to the right until he
comes to the rear of the house,
and climbs the ha/msp’eq. He

his arm. He goes around the fire once, holding him in this way.
Then he climbs the ha/msp’éq again, runs around the roof, and after
he comes down again bites another man. This is repeated four times.
The people during this time sing the new songs, and the ha/mats’a
dances around the fire, but not properly, as he is supposed to be still
out of his senses. After he has danced around the fire the fourth
time, he goes into the ma/wiL. Then all the people take off the hemlock
branches and throw them into the fire. This is called smoking the
wildness of BaxbakualanuXsi’waé out of the ha/mats’a. Then they
arrange themselves according to the societies to which they belong.

coppers.”! The name by which he calls himself here is the one which
he assumes at this festival. Then the members of the society to
which he belongs take the brass bracelets and the coppers out of the
box and give them to him. He says: ‘I obtained this property from
my father-in-law, and I am going to distribute it now according to the
laws of the winter dance.”

The ye/wix-ila turns everything over to the master of ceremonies or
to one of his own relatives, who in their turn distribute the property
among the assembly, giving the women first, then the ‘seals,’ and
lastly the qué’qutsa, each person receiving one stick of bracelets and
one stick of coppers. After the property has been distributed, the
people go home and take their breakfast in their own houses.

In the evening the yée’wix ila again requests four messengers to invite
the people. He tells them the names of the new ha/mats’a and k-i/n-
qalaLala, and tells them to call the people to come to his house, in order
to tame the new ha’/mats’a and k-i/nqalaLala. Each of these messen-
gers receives ope button blanket. They go to the various houses and

Let us go into the dancing house before dark!”

After they return to the dancing house, the ye’wix-ila calls four
more messengers, who also receive a button blanket each in payment
for their services. They must go to the end of the village, and begin-
ning at the last house they must say: ‘“We come back to call you.

people follow them at once, and all enter the dancing house.

530 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

During the whole day the whistles of the ha/mats’a were heard in the
house. Then the speaker of the ye/wix-ila says as follows: ‘Friends,
do as I desire! Try to pacify our friend! Let all the women dance!”!
This is a request to the women to dance with the ha/mats’a in order to
tame him. The master of ceremonies calls upon all the ha/mshamtsEs,
the hai/alik‘ilaL, the t?o/X’uit, and the k-i/nqalaLala to dance with the
ha/mats’a. They blacken their faces, put eagle down on their heads,
and begin to dance. Then the ha’mats’a shakes the ha’msp’eq and
comes out of the ma/wiL. At once the people begin to beat the boards,
but do not sing. The ha/mats’a goes around the fire once and disap-
pears again in the ma’wiL. The master of ceremonies says: ‘Some-
body must have made a mistake,” and calls up the paxa/lalat—that
means the shaman dancer. He steps forward, calls for a round rattle,
and as soon as the master of ceremonies has given it to him he begins
to sing the song of the paxa/‘lalaL.’ “You took me around the world,
BaxbakualanuXsi’wae.” He goes around the fire and then enters the
ma/wiL at the same place where the ha’mats’a went in. He stays
there for about ten minutes and then reappears, saying that the people
have made too much noise, and that they did not have enough down on
their heads, and that the ha/mats’a had disappeared again for these
reasons. The master of ceremonies calls for four dishes of eagle down.
Then four men come out of the right hand front corner of the house
carrying the dishes and saying that they were waiting for the orders
of the master of ceremonies. He sends the four men to feather the
heads of the people, beginning with the ha‘mats’a, continuing with the
other “seals,” and finishing with the qué/qutsa. Then the master of
ceremonies says that the eagle down brought into the house super-
natural power (which is not supposed to be present where there is no
down).

Now the ha/mats’a is seen to leave the ma/wiL again. He jumps
down, goes around the fire once, and disappears again. Again the
paxa’/lalaL is sent to discover if a mistake has been made which
induced the ha’mats’a to leave again. He sings the same song as
before, enters the ma/wiL, where he stays for some time. He reappears
and says that the ha’/mats’a was displeased because the hé‘iig-a did
not sing their secret song. Then four hé’lig-a are sent into the ma/wiL.
The yé’wix‘ila gives four button blankets to the master of ceremonies
and requests him to do with them whatever he pleases. The master
of ceremonies gives them to the he’lig-a, who then begin to sing: ‘* Wa

ha wa ha wa ha wa ha wa ha hai ya yé he ya yé ya ya wa ha wa ha hai
ya yé he ya yé ha yé ha, hoip.”

Now they enter the mawiL, and after a short time bring out the
ha/mats’a, who bites the arm of one of them. As soon as they approach
the door of the house, the ha/mats’a lets go his hold, turns around,
and bites a second one in the same way. They continue their way, and,
when they reach the ma/wiL, the ha’mats’a disappears once more. The
hé/lig-a follow him, and soon he reappears, biting the third one. As
soon as they come to the door, he lets go his hold and bites the fourth
one. When they reach the rear of the house again, the he/lig-a do not
allow him to reenter the ma/wiL. The people beat lane rapidly. Dur-
ing these ceremonies the ha/mats’a is entirely naked, with the exception
of a wreath of hemlock branches which he wears around his neck, one
around his head, one around the waist, and bracelets and anklets of the
same material.

Now the people begin to sing the new songs which were made for
the ha’mats’a. After the first song has been sung, he disappears in
the ma/wiL, and immediately the mask of QoaqoaXualanu Xsi/wae, the
raven, appears. After the mask has disappeared, the ha/mats’a appears
again, entirely naked. When he has finished his dance, the mask of
Baxbakualanu Xs!’ wae comes out (see p. 446). The mask disappears in
the ma/‘wiL, and the ha/mats’a comes out again dancing slowly. He
Wears a crown of red cedar bark on his head, a wide neck ring of the
same material, anklets, bracelets, a dancing apron, and a bear skin.
Then the people continue to sing the new songs which were made for
him. The master of ceremonies spreads a new mat in the middle of the >
rear of the house in front of the singers. After his dance the ha/mats’a
sits down on this mat, facing the rear of the house. Then the k-i/nqala-
Lala comes out of the ma/wilL singing her new secret song. After she
has finished, the people sing the new songs which were made for her in
the woods. She dances until the two songs are finished. Then the
master of ceremonies calls up a man named Ts’e/qameé (que/qutsa name) ;
“Come, friend, try if you can reach our friend.” ! This is the request to
him to tame the ha/mats’a. T's’é’/qamé asks for four pieces of white
soft cedar bark, which are given to him by the ye/wixila.2 Ts’@/qamé
takes them, crying “hoip, hoip.” That means that he is putting the
secret of the winter dance into the bark. He asks for a pole (about 6
‘feet long), which is given to him by the ye/wix-ila, or by the brother of
the latter, who is looking after the fire. Ts’/qamé ties the four pieces
of cedar bark to the end of the pole. Each piece is about 8 feet long.
He tells the people to be ready to beat time when the signal is given.
He asks one of the k-i/ pomenalait to take off the clothing of the ha/mats’a.

532 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The k-i/nqalaLala goes around the fire saying “‘hoip, hoip, hoip, hoip,”
and then takes the h i/mats’a’s clothing and cedar bark ornaments off.
Then Ts’é/qameé gives the signal to the people to begin beating time, and
as soon as they begin he puts one end of the cedar bark into the fire. He
runs around the fire until he comes to the place where the ha/mats’a is
sitting. Here he swings the burning bark over the ha/matsa’s head, and
at the same time the latter turns around squatting and crying “hap,
hap, hap.” ‘Ts’é/qamé goes around the fire once more, and keeping
his eye on the ha/mats’a until he reaches him the second time he swings
again the burning cedar bark over his head. ‘This is done four times.
This is called nawa/qama. Then the hé/lig:a lift the ha’mats’a, lug him
around the fire, and take him into the ma/wiL. The master of cere-
monies now calls the ye’wixila and asks him to pay Ts’e’qamé for his
work. The ye’wixila goes into his bedroom and brings out a button
blanket, which he gives to him. Then the yé/wix-ila asks the master
of ceremonies or one of his relatives to distribute the rest of the brass
bracelets, coppers, and button blankets among the people. Each
person receives one stick of bracelets, one stick of coppers, and one
button blanket.

Now all the profane must leave the house. The door is closed and
the purification of the ha/mats’a begins. Four men must take part
in this ceremony,—the kué’ts’én6x or the washer, the qa’néndx or
the rubber, the ts’é’silaénox or the tongsmaker, and the t’a/mtse-
nox or the time beater. Whatever these men ask for incidentally
to the ceremony must be given to them, and they retain it as their
personal property. When everything is quiet, the ts’é’silaénox asks
for a piece of cedar board about 6 feet long, for a wedge, and for a
stone hammer. After this is brought to him, the t’a’/mtsénox sits
down in his place ready to beat time. Then the ts’é/silaénéox asks for
a belt. After he has received it, he puts it on, goes around the fire
four times, carrying a rattle in his hand, while the t’a/mts’énox is beat-
ing time. He does not sing, but says “‘hoip, hoip.” After he has gone
around the fire four times, he stops, puts his rattle down, and stoops
three times, as though he was going to take up the hammer and wedge,
but he does not really take it until he stoops down the fourth time.
Every time he stoops the t’a/mtséndx gives a short rap on the board.
Then the ts’é/silaeénéx goes around the fire until he comes to the place
where the board is lying on the ground. He steps up to it, turns once
to the left, puts his wedge against the board, and pretends to drive it
in with his stone hammer, but he takes it off again, turns once more to
the left, and places it a second and third time against the board.
The fourth time he really, with one hard blow, drives the wedge into the
board and splits it. Then he asks the yé/wixila for a knife, and after
it is given to him he makes a pair of tongs out of the cedar board.
Then he asks for a clean mat and for a piece of soft white cedar bark.
He takes it up with his tongs, goes around the fire, and gives it to the
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 533

qa’nenox. Every time these men go around the fire the t’a/mtséndx
must beat the boards.

Then the qa’nénox takes the mat and spreads it on the floor at the
left-hand side of the door, and lays the cedar bark on it. He begins to
rub the bark and to cut it. When cuiting, he draws his knife three
times, pretending to cut, and every time he does so he turns to the
left. The fourth time he really begins to cut the bark. One of the
pieces which he cuts is about 6 feet, and two other pieces about 2 feet

longeach. <A knotis tied in the middle of the long piece, which is then
tied in shape of a ring, the ends crossing each other and leaving about
1 foot free. The two shorter pieces are tied near the middle of the long
piece, so that the whole forms a ring with two ends on one side and two
ends near the middle. The ring represents the body, the knot the head,
the upper ends the arms, and the lower ends the feet of a person.

Now he rises and gives a signal to the t’a’mtsen6x to beat time. He
goes around the fire once and stops near the tongs which the ts’é’si-
laenox made. Then he puts the ring down. Now the ts’e’silaendx
rises. He spreads the tongs with a small stick. Three times he pre-
tends to take them up, turning each time. The fourth time he really
takes them and goes toward the ring of white cedar bark, the qa’na/yu.
At this time the t’a’/mtsénox begins to beat time again. The ts’e’sila-
enodx goes around the fire with the tongs in his hands and keeps his
eye on the qa’na‘yu all the time. When he comes to the mat on which
it is lying, he pretends to take it up with the tongs, but he does not
touch it. Then he turns around to the left and extends his arms
toward the place of the rising sun. Every time he does so the t’a’/m-
tsénox gives a hard rap on the board, and the people cry “wa!” This is
repeated three times; the fourth time he takes the qa’na/yu, and goes
around the fire four times until he arrives at the east side of the house.

Then he pushes up the tongs three times. The fourth time he turns
them around and places the handle under the roof of the east side of the
house. He goes around the fire four times. Then he pretends to take
up four stones with his tongs. He does not really take them until the
fourth time. During this time the t’a’/mtsén6x beats again. Then the
kuéets’enox asks for a new dish, which is put on the floor. He asks for
water, which is brought to himin a bucket. When he takes the latter,
he gives a signal to the t’a’/mtsénox to beat. He walks around the
fire with the water, while all the people say “wa wa wa.” Every
time he comes to the point where he started, either opposite the door
or in the rear of the house, he turns and lifts his bucket toward the sun.
Every time he does so the t’a/mtséndx stops with a loud rap. After
he has done so four times, he goes to the dish, which is standing at the
left-hand side from the door. Three times he pretends to pour out
water, and the fourth time he empties it into the dish. After this has
been done, the new ha/mats’a is called. to come out from the ma/wiL.
He and the k-i/nqalaLala come out entirely naked. A new mat is put
534 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

down for them next to the dish. The qa’nénox holds the mat in his
hands, turns, and pretends to put it down. After he has done so three
times, he really puts it down. Every time he turns he says, “ hoi’p.”
The fourth time, after putting down the mat, the k-i/nqalaLala sings
the hé/lig-a song.! The k-i/nqalaLala goes four times around the fire
singing. The ha‘mats’a must follow her, and every time the k:i/nqala-
Lala turns he must turn too. They turn whenever they reach the point
opposite the door and in the rear of the house. After they have made
four circuits, they sit down, the ha/mats’a looking wild all the time, as .
though he wanted to bite the people. The qa’néndx rises and goes
around the fire after signaling the t’a/mtsen6ox to beat tine. He takes
a small stick, and places it in the wall of the house a little below the
tongs on which the qa’nayu is hanging, but before really placing it
there he pretends to make the motion three times, turning after each
motion. Then he attempts to take the qa’nayu from the tongs, but he
really does not take it.down until after he has made the motion three
times. As soon as he really takes it, the t’a’/mtsenox gives a loud rap,
and says ‘“‘ya.” Then the qa’nendx turns once and puts the qa’nayu
on the short stick. Again he goes around the fire while the t’a/mtsé-
nox is beating time. He goes to the tongs, turns around once, and
takes them down.

He goes around the fire holding the tongs downward. During this
time the t?a/mtsenox beats time. The qa’nénox stops at the door and
holds the tongs toward the door. Then the kué’ts’én6x rises, and with
a common baton he strikes the small stick which spreads the tongs,
thus throwing it out of the door. If the stick should happen to strike
the walls of the house and not hit the door, it forebodes short life for
the ha’mats’a. Then the ts’é’silaenox turns and goes around the fire.
Three times he pretends to take the stones out of the fire, every time
extending the tongs towards the sun. The fourth time he really takes
the stones up. Then the people cry “wa wa.” He turns, goes around
the fire four times, and stops near the dish containing the water. Three
times he pretends to throw the stones into the water, and every time
he does so the t’a‘mtsénox beats time. The fourth time he throws them
into the water.

This ceremony is performed with each stone singly. Then he goes
again around the fire and puts the tongs back under the roof in the
same place where they were before.

Now the kué’ts’én6x rises. He goes around the fire stretching his
right hand backward and shaking it. This is the signal for the t’a/m-
tsendx to beat the board as hard as possible. Every time he reaches
the east and the west side of the fire he turns around and the beater
gives one short rap. Every time he comes to the turning point he
extends his hands toward the qa’na/yu as though he was going to
take it down. His hands are shaking all the time like those of Bax-

1 It is my power to pacify you (see page 527).
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 535

bakualanuXsi’wae. The fourth time he really takes the qa’na/yu down.
Its “head” is in his left hand, its lower end in his right hand. He
holds his left hand stretched forward. He goes around the fire, and at
the turning point extends the ring toward the sun. Every time he
does so the t’a/mtsénox gives a short beat.

He walks around the fire four times, and finally stops near the
ha‘mats’a. Then the qa’nenox calls the kuéts’enox to come to the
ha/mats’a. The kuets’enox goes aroung the fire four times, stops at
the dish holding the water, and stoops down three times, intending to
dip water out with his hands. He does not really take it until the
fourth time. He holds the water in his two hands, goes around the
fire, lifts it toward the sun, turns around, and puts it on the head of
the ha‘mats’a, softly stroking the latter. Then he takes more water,
puts it again on the ha/mats’a’s head in the same manner. This cere-
mony is also repeated four times. The k-i/nqalaLala sits next to the
ha/mats’a. The kue’ts’endox turns around and puts four handfuls of
water on her head in the same way as he put it on that of the
ha/mats’a. Then the qa’nenox rises again and the t’a’‘mtsén6dx beats
time. He goes around the fire carrying the ring, and on the west side
he extends it toward the sun. Then he walks around to the ha/mats’a,
turns slowly, and puts the ring over the ha’mats’a’s head, doubling it
up and wiping his whole body. The ha’mats’a first extends his right
arm, then his left arm, through the rng. When the ring comes down
to his feet, he raises his right leg first, puts it down outside the ring,
turns all around on his right foot, then takes up his left foot, and sits
down on the mat, facing east. The qa’néndx takes the ring up, turns
around, and drops his left hand and raises his right hand alternately.

Again the ha’/mats’a extends his right arm, and he rubs him in the
same way as the first time. This is repeated four times. Then the
qa’nenox goes around the fire and performs the same ceremony with
the k-i/ngalaLala. Then the people sing: ‘In olden times you went
all around the world with the supernatural being.” !

The qa’nenox takes the tongs down from the roof and takes up the
qav’na’‘yu, while the t’a/mtsenox is beating time. He goes around the
fire swinging the ring, turns in the front and in the rear of the house,
raising the ring toward the sun. After he has gone around the fire
four times, he swings the ring over the fire until it ignites. ‘Then all
the people say ‘‘wa wa.” He walks out of the house, and burns the
ring on the street. Then he burns the tongs in the house. Then all
the people are allowed to enter the house.

After the song has been sung, the ha/mats’a gets excited, leaves the
house, and runs around the village.

The ye/wix-ila now brings all his dishes and kettles, spoons and mats,
and distributes them ainong the people of his tribe, the people going to
the pile and each taking one piece. This celebration lasts until it is
nearly daylight.

‘Appendix, page 724.
536 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

About this time the four officers, the kué/ts’en6x, the qa’nenox, the
ts’é/silaénox, and the t’a/mtsenox, leave the house, the last named car-
rying the baton. Then they say:' ‘ Here is food for you que’qutsa.”

This is the notice for the last great feast in the winter dance cere-
monies. At this time they count up all the mistakes made by the
ha‘mats’a.?

For four days after this the ha/mats’a runs about biting the people.
On the fourth night the yé/wix-ila calls his society and tells them that
the ha‘msp’éq is to be burnt. A messenger belonging to his society is
sent out to call all the people together. He is given a button blanket
and a new head ring and neck ring. This messenger goes to every
house and says :* ‘Friends, we will tame our great friend Bee
Then the whole tribe, men, women, and children, assemble. They sing
the ha/mats’a songs, and during the ensuing day the ye’wix-ila pays
them for their bites, the price being one canoe for each bite. The
women who danced receive bracelets; the men who sang, button blan-
kets. These presents must be returned with interest when the receivers
give a festival another year.

All the qué’qutsa must now leave the building. The fool dancers
and bears are also required to go out. Only the ha’mats’a, ha/msham-
tsEs, nO/ntsistalaL, qoe/qoasElaL, na/ne of BaxbakualanuXsi’waée, and
k‘inqalaLala; the laxsa, stay. They nail the door up and close all
the chinks and holes in the walls. The k-i/nqalaLala take the batons,
then all the ha/mats’as begin to cry “hap, hap.” The ha/mshamtsEs cry
“wip, wip, wip,” and all the others utter their peculiar sounds. The k:i/n-
qalaLala beat time, and each sings his own song. During this time the
ha‘mats’a gets excited, goes around the fire and around the ha/msp’éq
four times. Then they lift the ha’msp’eq and pull it down, laying it so
that it slants down from the roof. During this ceremony all the ha’ma-
ts’as are naked. Four times they go up and down the ha/msp’éq while
it 18 in this position, erying “hap, hap.” Then the ha’msp’éq is taken
down entirely. The ha’mats’as cut it into four pieces, while the k:i/nqa-
laLala and the others who are present make as much noise as possible.
Then four ha/mats’as carry each piece. They carry it around the fire,
turning in front and in the rear of the house, and crying “hap” all
the time. Then they throw the pieces into the fire. Next, the ma/wiL
is pulled down and burnt with similar ceremonies. For four days they
remain in the house singing the new ha/mats’a songs. On the fourth
day they dress in red cedar bark, strew their heads with feathers, and
blacken their faces. Then the wi/leqa—the first meal of the ha/mats’a

after his return from the bush—is celebrated. The k-i/nqalaLala leaves
the house, followed by the ha/mats’a, each singing his own song. They
go into four houses and are fed by the people. The ha/mats’a must
eat all that is given to him. Then they walk into the next house, where
they are fed again.

Now the whole tribe assembles again in the house of the yé/wixila,
A canoe mast is put up in the middle of the house, and the master of
ceremonies asks, ‘‘ Who will take the red cedar bark off from the people
and keep it until next winter?” Whoever intends to give a winter
dance the following winter must step up and take hold of the stick.
' Then all the people take their rings off and throw them into the fire.
Four only are kept until the next year. The people tie handkerchiefs
around their heads in place of the cedar bark.

Then ‘‘the sound of the batons is driven out of the house.” The
people beat time four times and then throw all the sticks into the fire.
This is the end of the winter dance.

After biting persons, and particularly after eating slaves or bodies,
the ha’/mats’a must observe a great many rules. Immediately after they
have eaten of a corpse, the he’lig-a brings them salt water, of which
they drink great quantities in order to produce vomiting. If they do
not vomit aS many pieces as they have swallowed, their excrements are
examined in order to ascertain if all the pieces of human flesh have
passed the body. The bones of the body that they have eaten are kept
for four months. They are kept alternately four days in their bedrooms
on the north side of the house where the sun does not strike them, and
four days under rocks in the sea. Finally they are thrown into the sea.

The ha/mats’as are not allowed to go out of the house door, but they
must use the secret door in the rear of the house only. When one of
them goes out to defecate, all the others must go with him, each ecarry-
ing a small stick. They must all sit down together on a long log.
They must rise again three times, and do not sit down until the fourth
time. Before sitting down they must turn four times. Before they
rise they must turn four times. Then they go back to the house.
Before entering they must raise their feet four times. With the fourth
step they really pass the door. They go in, the right foot first. In the
doorway they turn four times and walk slowly into the house. They
are not allowed to look back.

For four months after eating human flesh the ha/mats’a uses a spoon,
dish, and kettle of his own, which are thrown away after the lapse of
the prescribed time.

He must wear soiled cedar bark. He must stay alone in his bedroom.
A grizzly bear dancer is placed in the doorway to see that no one
enters.

Before taking water out of a bucket or before dipping it out of a
brook he must dip his cup three times into the water. He must not
take more than four mouthfuls at one time.
538 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

He must carry a wing bone of an eagle and drink through it, as his
lips must not touch the brim of his cup. He also wears a copper nail
toscratch his head with, as his nails must not touch his skin, else they
would come off. For sixteen days after he has eaten human flesh he
must not eat any warm food, and for four months he is not allowed to
blow hot food in order to cool it. For a whole year he must not touch
his wife, nor is he allowed to gamble or to work. When the dancing
season is over, he feigns to have forgotten the ordinary ways of man,
and has to learn everything anew. He acts as though he were very
hungry all the time.

The whole ceremonial of bringing back the novice is, according to
the ideas of the Kwakiutl, a repetition of the same ceremonial per-
formed by the wolves who attempted to bring back their novices; and
the following tradition, which, however, is not complete in all its details,
is made to account for its origin:!

Mink made a salmon trap back of Qa/‘logwis, the village of the
Kwakiutl. The different tribes held a winter ceremonial, and the sons
of the chief of the wolves had disappeared in the woods. While there
they spoiled Mink’s salmon trap. For three days they did so. Then
Mink became angry. He made up his mind to watch who was tamper-
ing with his salmon trap. He went there in the evening and hid near
his salmon weir. Now the four sons of the wolf, who had disappeared
in the woods, came. They went right up to the salmon weir and took
out the salmon that had gone into it. Then Mink said to himself,
‘You are the ones who tampered with my weir.” They sat down and
ate the salmon raw. Mink crawled up to them from behind and killed
them with his club. He cut off their heads, and went home carrying
the four heads. Nobody knew that he had killed them; even his mother
did not know it.

Now the wolves were going to bring back their novices after two
days. When the time came for bringing the novices back, Kue/kuaxaoe
was master of ceremonies. Mink closed all the holes and chinks of his
own house, and tied ropes of cedar around it to strengthen it.

Before daylight Mink went in his canoe to Mé/mk-umlis. He made a
salmon weir of stones. Then he went and sat down on arock. He
looked at his weir. “ What fish isin my trap?” hesaid. ‘A small bull
head,” replied the trap. Then he scratched his head. “Oh, that is
pretty; lam working hard looking after my trap! Throw it into the
water!” He asked again, ‘What fish isin my trap?” It replied, ‘A
small flounder.” He threw it into the water, and then the trap had
caught first an eel, then a dogfish, a perch, a silver perch, a cohoes sal-
mon, a dog salinon, a humpback salmon, a steel-head salmon, a spring
salmon, and finally a si’siuL. Then he said, ‘* That is it; that is it!”
and he was glad. He took the si/siuL out of his trap and put it down
on the reck. He broke off hemlock branches, laid them into his canoe,
and put the fish on top of them. Then he went home to his house at

' Appendix, page 725,
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 539

Qa‘logwis. He went ashore to his house. His mother was lying down.
Then Mink spoke: ‘ Don’t stay here, grandmother, but carry my fish
into the house.” His mother went down to the beach. She went to
the canoe and looked in vain for the fish. Her body became contorted;
her head looked backward, because she had seen the si/siun. Mink
waited for his mother a long time. Then he arose and went to look
for her. He found her, and saw that her whole body was contorted.
“That is the way, grandmother! Are you so glad?” He took her and
straightened her body. He earried the si/siuL himself from the beach
to the house. He put it into a box. It became evening. The people
intended to bring back the novices that night. In vain they beat the
boards for the expected ones. They had been killed by Mink.

The people were still singing in the house. One of the chiefs said,
“Let us try, dancers, to bring back our novices.” But when they did
not come after numerous attempts, one of them spoke: ‘ Dancers, we
are not going to succeed in bringing back our novices.” One of them
replied, ‘‘ Wash yourselves, friends.” Then the last one spoke: ‘¢ You
who are not initiated, turn your faces toward the rear of the house.
We will go im before dark.” Then the people thought they would have
to give up trying to bring back their novices. They listened, but did
not hear the arrival of the supernatural power.

Up to this time Mink had not made his appearance. Then the people

‘said, “ What is the matter with our chief K-éx- (mink)?” They went
to fetch him. Now Mink, and his cousins the raccoon, the killer whale,
and the squirrel, did what they had planned. His sister Ts’E’staytkoa
and the raccoon went and pulled out a board in the rear corner of the
dancing house. The raccoon sat down in that corner. Now K-éx:
came in. He danced a little while and went out again. Then he came
in and danced again with his sister. He sang,—

Spread your legs, Ts’E’stayikoa,
Spread your legs, Ts’E/staytkoa,—
and jumped through between the spread legs of his sister.

Then he came in again. He wore the heads of the wolves for his

mask. But he was hiding them behind his blanket. He sang:

Mink is wearing the middle of the face of the sons of the chief of the wolves.

He went out again; and when he came in, the heads of the wolves
were attached to his blanket. Now the people tried to kill him,
because they saw that he had killed the sons of their chief. Then he
went out of the doorway in the rear while his friends the squirrel and
the raccoon were beating the drum. He came in again wearing the
si/siuL mask. As soon as he entered the door he uncovered the mask,
and all the people died in convulsions when they saw it. Then K-éx-
selected all his relatives and the people whom he liked and resuscitated
them. That is the end.

The initiation of members of the lower grades of the ts’é@/tsaéqa
is not attended with as elaborate ceremonies as that of the la’xsa.
540 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Their initiation is called kue/xalak". Those who are initiated by the
kué/xalak" ceremonies are called g-ixség:i, that means, leaning against
the wall of the ma/wit. In most cases they return from their initia-
tions during the festivals celebrated to bring back a novice of the
la‘xsa. Sometimes, however, while the people are assembled at a
feast, the wi/xsa or kue/xalak" novice is taken away by the spirits, and
then his father announces that four days hence he will be brought
back. He calls the master of ceremonies of the kue/xalak", who wears
a head ring ornamented with five feathers,—one in front, one on each
side, and two in the back. His face is painted red. He enters
and begins to go around the fire, swinging his baton from the elbow.
When he reaches the rear of the house, he turns around, swinging his
stick, and then gives one rap on a board, crying at the same time
‘‘cha/mamamama” (very rapidly). As soon as he does so, all the peo-
ple strike the boards. Meanwhile the master of ceremonies turns
around, strikes the board again, crying “‘hamamai’.” Again all the peo-
ple strike the boards together and cry ‘“ha/mamamama.” These cries
represent the sounds made by the ghosts. The master of ceremonies
continues his circuit, swinging his baton all the time. When he reaches
the door, he turns again and proceeds. When he reaches the rear of
the house the second time, the same ceremony is repeated. He con-
tinues his circuit in the same way as before. When he reaches the rear
of the house the third time, he turns and cries “ yéhee’” and gives a °
rap on the boards; then all the people ery “ yehée’ho000.” This repre-
sents the sound of the wolf. While the people are beating time the
master of ceremonies turns again and then strikes the boards, crying
“yehee,” drawing out the last syllable as long as possible. Then the
people strike the boards all at the same time and repeat his cry.

The master of ceremonies goes around the fire the fourth time, and
when he reaches the rear of the house, he turns and cries ‘‘ wow0w0” or
‘“woe’p.” Then the people beat time and say ‘‘kf” (the f drawn out
very long). This is the sound of Hai‘alik-ila. During this time the
whistles of the ghosts are heard continuously.

When the master of ceremonies turns the last time, he smiles at the
people, strikes the board, and cries ‘‘ wo,” to which all the people reply
“hii.” The ceremonies of this evening are called 1OL.

Now the chief steps forward and says, “This is finished, friends;
bring in your boxes.”' While he remains standing, those people who
are willing to bring boxes leave the house and soon return carrying
them on their shoulders. The lids and ropes of the boxes are thrown
into the fire. The boxes are placed in a row in the rear of the house, the
openings turning backward. Then the yée/wix-ila asks one of his rela-
tives or his daughter todanece. He holds a large staffin his hand, which
is called qa/sop’eq or “ feast staff.” He promises-to celebrate the winter
dance; and calling up his father-in-law says that he was compelled to

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 541

celebrate the winter dance without having had previous knowledge of
what was coming, and requests his father-in-law to repay him for the
property with which he was presented at the time of the marriage of
his daughter. The father-in-law rises, asks the young man to give
him the staff, which he grasps in the middle, holding it horizontally.
Then he calls his friends to take hold of the staff with him. By doing
so they pledge themselves to help the old man to repay his son-in-law.
He says how much he is going to pay to his son-in-law and returns the
staff to him. Then the latter takes it and carries it, pretending that it
it is exceedingly heavy, saying, ‘6, 0, 6,6!” It is supposed that the
property is attached to the staff.

The father-in-law asks: ‘* When will you want me to pay you all this
property?” And the young man says that he wants it by the third day.
The following days the people are invited to feast and to dance in the
chief’s house. A sail is stretched across the rear of the house. The
seal society have their seats close to this sail.

Now the master of ceremonies rises and calls one man (the ma/mn-
nats’eénox), whose office it is to look after the drum. This office is
hereditary. The master of ceremonies says: “Go and bring your
inheritance.” The man rises, steps up to the fire, goes around it, leaves
the house, and soon returns carrying the drum on his shoulder. He
stops in the doorway, turns around silently, and walks around the fire
four times. He stops finally in the left-hand rear corner of the house,
where he puts down the drum on its flat side. He carries a small
whistle in his mouth and every time he pushes the drum he blows the
whistle. It is of course supposed that this sound is produced by the
drum. Then he says, “It is done; I have brought my inheritance.”
The master of ceremonies asks, ‘“‘ Did you bring the baton with you?”
To which the man replies, “‘My grandfather has been dead so long
that I forgot this part of my inheritance.” He is sent to fetch it, and
walks out of the house and returns in the same way as the first time.
He deposits the batons in the middle of the rear of the house, and
every time he moves them he blows another whistle.

Then the master of ceremonies calls another man, whose office it is
to look after the eagle down. This office is also hereditary. He goes
out in the same way as the other officer, and soon returns, carrying a
painted bag filled with down. He says, ‘‘Here is the bag which my
grandfather left for me to take care of.” He walks around the fire
four times, turning in the front and in the rear, and finally deposits it
in the right hand front corner of the house. Then four men take four
dishes, each takes one handful of down out of the bag, and puts it into
the dish. The down is pulled apart so that it fills the dishes entirely.
The owner of the down shakes his bag, which then appears to be
quite full again, and carries it back. It is supposed that the bag
always remains full. Then the master of ceremonies takes up one of
the dishes and asks his brother, who is chief of the qué/qutsa, to take
542 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

another one. The name of this office is da/sqamé xa kué/xalak", holder
of the kue’xalak". The officer has the name Q’E’mtq’atas.'_ Two other
men take the other two dishes and they walk around the fire once.
Then they begin to strew the down on the heads of the people. The
master of ceremonies begins either with the ha/nshamtsEs or with the
bear-fool dancers (1E/nq’oLEla) (see p. 499 No. 16). Then he gives eagle
down to the fool dancers and to all the other dancers.

Then the master of ceremonies goes around the fire again, swinging
the baton. He stops in the rear of the house and strikes a box. All the
people imitate him. Then a number of women, who are hired for the
purpose, begin to dance. The people sing one song for each of the
women. After this dance the chief of the qué/qutsa promises a feast
for the next day, and the people go home.

The next morning a number of que’qutsa go around trom house to
house to invite the people for the feast. The same women who danced
the first night, dance this evening. Again a feast is announced for
the following day. On this day all the dancers who are allowed to
wear masks enter first and arrange themselves behind the sail, wearing
their masks. Then the people enter, last of all the master of cere-
monies, wearing his cedar bark ring, his face painted red. Again he

swings his stick from the elbow, turns in the house, and says *‘ w6i woi,”

and strikes the box. Then all the people beat the boxes for about ten
minutes. Suddenly the master of ceremonies stretches out his arm
and swings the baton slowly all around. The people stop beating time
at once. He continues swinging his baton, and swings it faster and
faster. Finally he beats the box again, and again all the people begin
to beat time. Now the dancers are heard behind the curtain, each with
his peculiar sound. The curtain begins to shake and is lowered, all
the masks standing behind it. This is the end of the celebration of
the third night. Again a feast is promised for the next day. This
evening the same ceremony is repeated, but after all the masks have
appeared in the rear of the house, the young person who had disap-
peared in the beginning of the ceremonies comes out from the right
hand rear corner of the house. He sings his new song and dances.
Then his father brings out all the property given to him by his father-
in-law and distributes it among the people. Bracelets, coppers, and
Spoons are given to the women and children. Silver bracelets, kettles,
and box covers are given to the men. Before the people go home the
chief promises another feast.

he following day the people assemble again, and a feast is cele-
brated, in which everybody takes part. Before they begin to eat, the
host brings all the button blankets which he has received from his
father-in-law and distributes them. The women receive white blankets.

‘According to tradition, the first man of this name invited the people to a feast,
but, instead of feeding them, only taught them four songs. The name means, eating
songs.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 543

This is called a present to wipe the mouth with (da/yaxstano). Each
person receives one dish and spoons, which they take home after the
feast. After this feast the novice receives his name. Then the people
leave the house. The purification of the novice is performed in the
same way as described above (see p. 532).

Sometimes the kue’xalak" begins with a curious contest between the
ts’é’‘tsaeqa and the profane. This ceremony is used by the Kwakiutl,
Ma/maleéleqala, Nimkish, Lau/‘itsis, T’Ena/xtax, T's’a’watEénox, Axua/-
mis, Qoe’xsot’enox. The tribes forming the Newettee and Koskimo
group use the ghost dance in its place. Mr. George Hunt told me the
following instance of the performance of this ceremony:

The Q’o‘mk-iitis, Walas Kwakiutl, and Kué’xa had celebrated the
ts’é‘tsaéqa without inviting the Gue’tEla, the highest of the Kwakiutl
tribes. Then the chief of the last-named tribe called all his people
together into his house. He put up a long pole, the ‘“‘ winter dance pole,”
leaning it against the beam of his house, and asked his people, ‘Are
you glad to hear the winter dance going on at the other end of our vil-
lage while you are asleep in your houses? If you want to remain
ba‘xus, do so. If you want to join the winter dance, then one of you
step up and touch this pole.” As nobody stepped up to touch the pole
he put his hand on it himself and said: ‘‘ I will be the ye/wix-ila; but
first let us all turn ourselves into dogs” (wa/tsé; in the ordinary lan-
guage, wao’tsé). Then all his people took off their clothing, even their
earrings and anklets, the women keeping only a small petticoat.
They blackened their faces and hands and painted men’s and dogs’
faces all over their bodies. Then they cut the winter dance pole in
pieces about a fathom in length each. The chief ordered them to cut a
hole in the rear wall of the house. After this was done, they went out
secretly and from the rear approached the house in which the other
tribes were celebrating their winter dance. Then they barked like dogs,
broke through the rear wall of the house, and drove out all the dancers,
including even the ha’mats’a. They broke the canoes and all the
belongings of the dancers. This was their revenge for not being
invited to the festival. This ceremony is called wa’ts’axt, which means,
dogs running from one house to the other.

Now the ts’ét’/saéqa assembled on one side of the street, while the
“dogs” or the ba’/xus assembled opposite them. The chief of the
Gue’tEla, standing in front of his tribe, asked the ve’wix-ila of the other
tribes, ““Can you throw the supernatural power among us?” Then the
ts’e’tsaeqa began to beat time, the qué/qutsa and me’emqoat all stand-
ing together. Then the t’6/X’uit with the frog stepped out from among
the ts’e’tsaéqa and danced like the ma/magqa, trying to catch his super-
natural power. After some time she apparently caught it in her hands
and threw it against the “dogs.” The first throwing is called the
daElk" (dEda/LElaL, Newettee dialect), which means laughing. The
dogs laugh and bark all at the same time.
544 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Then the ts’ét/saéqa beat time again. Again the dancer caught his
supernatural power, went four times forward and backward, turned
around, and threw it against the dogs. Then they sat down, still laugh-
ing, and began to scratch their heads. Again they barked. The
ts’e/tsaeqa beat time for a third time, and the dancer caught the super-
natural power again. She went forward and backward with quick steps,
turned around, and threw it again. Then the dogs rushed into the
water, scratching and rubbing their bodies, which means that they are
removing the ba/xus from their bodies. They barked and came out
again.

Now the qué/qutsa of the other tribes assembled in a group by them-
selves and sent four men to the dogs, apparently to send some message,
but actually in order to carry to them some red cedar bark. After they
had returned, the dogs in their turn sent four of their number to fetch
some more cedar bark. This is repeated four times, and is called
ts’a/ts’éxsila—that is, pretending to carry messages.

Now the chief of the qué’qutsa spoke to his people: “Take care; don’t
give in, and remain what you are.” All his people arose. Then the
que/qutsa beat time again, and the dancer continued her dance. Sud-
denly she was seen to hold red cedar bark in her hands. Four times
she went backward and forward holding the cedar bark and moving her
hands up and down. She turned four times, and every time stretched
her hands out as though she was going to throw the cedar bark against
the “dogs.” The fourth time she really threw it. Then all the people
stooped, and when they arose again they had cedar bark rings on their
heads.

Then the hamats’a, ni/LmaL, na‘né, and the other mé’emqoat of the
Gue’tEla began to get excited. The chief pushed his son toward them.
They surrounded him and dragged him around until all of a sudden he
disappeared. Then it was said that the supernatural power had taken
him away from the ha/mats’a. This novice was now kue’xalak". The
chief next invited all the “dogs” and the ts’é’tsaéqa into his house and
annou..ced that after four days he was going to try to bring the novice
back. This is called wa/sdana qap’e’k", or short assembly, and takes
the place of the qap’e’k" ceremony described above. The kué’xalak"
then continues as described before. -

X. THE WINTER CEREMONIAL AT ForRT RUPERT, 1895-96.

In the preceding chapter I have given a general description of the
ceremonial of the initiation of a single novice. When the ceremony is
actually in progress, there are several novices to be initiated, feasts are
being held, and numerous incidental ceremonies are performed which
depend upon circumstances, such as atonement for mistakes, rivalry
between chiefs, and so forth. In order to make clear the character of
the ceremonial, I will describe in the present chapter the ceremonial as
it actually took place and so far as I witnessed it in the winter of
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 5AD5

1895-96. At that time three tribes had assembled at Fort Rupert
(T'sa’/xis)—the Kwakiutl, the Koskimo, and Na/q’oaqtog. The Kos-
kimo ineluded also the G:0’p’enox, L’a/sq’éndx, and Gua/ts’éndx. I
reached Fort Rupert on November 15, 1895, and shall record here what
I saw.

On the 16th of November one of the Na‘q’oaqt6q gave a feast. The
Kwakiutl had their seats in the rear of the house, the Koskimo at the
right hand side, the Na‘q’oaqt6q on the left hand side. When all had
assembled, the chief speaker of the Na/q’oaqt6q said: ‘ Welcome,
friends. Now that you have all come in, take the handles of your
batons and sing.”' Then the batons were distributed. Planks were
laid for beating time. While the people were still coming in, one of
the que’tsEm (que/qutsa) began to tease a fool dancer, who intended
to give up his dance and to become a qué’qutsa. He pulled his nose,
rubbed it with snow, and threw snowballs at it. As stated before,
the fool dancer is supposed to have a long nose, and to resent all allu-
sions to the nose. He does not allow it to be touched. The que’qutsa
tried in this manner to excite him so as to prevent him from leaving
the seal society and becoming a qué/qutsa. Finally, a number of
qué’/qutsa joined the first que/tsEm. They pulled the nose of the fool
dancer, spat on it, and smeared it with grease, notwithstanding his
endeavors to escape them. Finally, they tied him to one of the house
posts and continued to maltreat his nose. Now the Kwakiutl sang
two songs. They were followed by the Koskimo, who sang two songs
in their turn. Meanwhile the meal, which consisted of soap- berries,
had been prepared, and the speaker held up a dish which was intended
for the first ha/mats’a. He shouted: “This is the dish of Yaqois.”?
The dish was carried to him. The members of the seal society re-
ceived their shares in order, next the women, and finally the que’-
qutsa. Now the host turned to the fool dancer who was tied to the
post, and whom the people were teasing again. He said: “I will ask
your friends to stay at their places for a little while because I am
cooking for you, and wish to feed you.” Then several of the fool dan-
cers came to his assistance. They licked the grease off from his nose,
untied him, and took him back to his seat. As soon as the dishes were
distributed, the host’s assistants began to prepare the second course,
which consisted of rice. While the people were eating, the different
societies uttered their cries:

“The hens are pecking !”?
“The great seals keep on chewing.” *

“The food of the great killer whales is sweet.” !

‘The food of the foolish boys is sweet.” ”

“The great rock cods are trying to get food.”

“The great sea lions throw their heads downwards.” +

The Mosmos said: ‘ It will be awful.” ®

When uttering these cries, the members of the societies lifted their
spoons and seemed to enjoy the fun. Next, the Koskimo (tribe) lifted
their spoons and all cried “yu.” Then they ate as quickly as they could,
and all the different qué’qutsa societies vied with each other, singing
all at the same time.

Next, a man arose who acted as though he was a Haida. He
delivered a speech, during which he made violent gestures, imitating
the sound of the Haida language. An interpreter who stood next to
him translated the pretended meaning of his speech, which was sup-
posed to be of the nature of thanks to the host for the soap berries,
because they were one of the principal food articles of the Haida, and
because the speaker was pleased to eat the kind of food to which he
was accustomed in his own country. He continued, saying that he
carried a box filled with food which he was going to give to the person
who would pronounce his name. Then the host’s daughter was called
upon, and was asked to say his name. He began, G-a’/ts0, which she
repeated; Se’as, which she also repeated; then followed, spoken very
rapidly, Qoaga’ni Gustate’n Gusgitate’n Gusoa/t Qoagé/ns Qaqa’xsla.é
Then she said: ‘“‘I can not say this; I must go to school in order to
learn it.” The Haida asked her to go to school with him for four
nights; then she would know it. The girl’s father interrupted them,
Saying that he wanted to wash his daughter before she went to school
with him.

Now the Kwakiutl and the Koskimo sang two songs each, before the
rice was dished out. After the songs the host’s father-in-law, who had
contributed the rice for the feast, spoke as follows: ‘O, friends! I have
not finished giving food for the marriage of my son-in-law to my
daughter;” and turning to his son-in-law, he continued: ‘Don’t say
that word. Don’t refuse my kind offer, else I shall be ashamed. I do
not do the same as other people, who only pretend to give feasts, giv-
ing only to those who have to buy my property from me.”7

While the rice was being eaten a man arose and announced that he
was going to buy a copper from E/wantXtse. The latter replied, but
in his speech he made a mistake, naming the summer name of a person.
He was interrupted at once and compelled to sit down.

November 18.—In the morning the Kwakiutl assembled in their
secret meeting place in the woods. A new bear dancer and fool dancer
were to be initiated in the evening and the plan of the festival was
laid out. At the same time the song makers taught the people the
four new songs which the father of the new bear dancer had bought
from them, and which were to be sung in the evening. Then ga/lsaxola,
who was going to give the dance, made the following speech:

“Now come, my tribe, come Nu’/xnémis, come HO0/LEIité, come
LE'me-ala, x‘i/xak-ala, aud Nénau’‘alakuéla. NowlI will make my speech
on this place of my friends. I will let you know my heart, friends.
We will begin to beat the boards this night. You shall begin the
songs, Dé’/mis, and you Waxssanulisax, and you NaXualisax, you
song makers. That, Ts’a/qamé and Go’koayi, is all that we say to our
friends.”

Then NE/msqemiit arose and answered: “I am the one who was
struck by the words of our friend.” All the men who were sitting on
the ground, said: ‘“‘Go on!” He continued: “Now come! Listen to
the speech of our friend on this ground and take care else the secret of
our song makers will be known. I say this, Nu’/xnémis and HO/LElite.
Take care, friends. I say this, LE’/mg:ala, I say this, x‘l/xak-ala.”

Then the song makers sung and put words into the old songs. Now
the song maker finished. Then the men who gave the ceremonial told
how many dancers there were to be and how many songs. Now he
finished. Then the song maker took as many sticks as there were to
be dancers, and gave them to him. Then the man who gave the cere-
monial named each dancer and said: ‘This will be the song of Ga‘yax-
stalasas,” and pushed one stick into the ground. Then he called the
name of another one and put a stick into the ground. He put down as
many sticks as there were women who were to dance.

When he had spoken, LE’mg-ala arose and asked his tribe: *‘ How
will you dress?” The chief of the killer whales, Qa/quLayi, arose and
said he would go with his friends, and the chief of the policemen, Gu’-
kwayu, arose and said he would go with his men and they would dress.
LE/mg:ala was standing all the time while the people were speaking.
After they had finished, he said: Now, Qa/quLayi, now Gu’kwayu,
you have finished your speeches. [thank you. Why should you be

ashamed, friends? We do not need to be ashamed of what we are
doing here in the woods.”

He continued: ‘Now take care, members of the seal society! put on
your painting of charcoal. Take good care of what we are doing in the
house; if anything should happen to one of our masks you must get
excited. Wa, wa!”

After their return they were invited by one man of the tribe to a seal
feast in which the Na/q’oaqt6q and Koskimo did not take part, because
seal feasts are considered a privilege of the noblest tribe, namely, the
Kwakiutl. The seal was singed and boiled. Then the skin with the
adhering blubber was cut spirally all around the body, and handed to
the men who stood up all around the house. They received about a
yard of blubber each. Then the host made a short speech; and after
the four feast songs were sung, they all fell to. After the blubber was
dispatched, the meat was distributed in dishes and eaten.

In the evening the father of the new bear dancer gave a feast. The
Kwakiutl sat in the rear of the house, the Koskimo on the left hand
side on entering, the Na/q’oaqt6q on the right hand side. When all
had entered, the members of the seal society came in—first the bears
dressed in button blankets. They had bears’ paws on their hands, put
on likemittens. They remained standing in the door and looked around
wildly. The next to enter was the Ts’0/noqoa, who, according to the
tradition, is sleeping all the time. She had her eyes closed and attempted
to go to the rear of the house, turning to the left, while the customary
circuit is to the right. One of the messengers who was stationed in the
door took her by the arm and led her to the right. A rope was stretched
from the door to her place, along which she walked to her seat in the
rear of the house, feeling her way by means of the rope. The next to
enter were the fool dancers. While they were going to the rear of the
house a loud noise was heard outside. They pretended to be afraid,
hid their faces among the people, and hastened to their seats in the
rear of the house. The noise came nearer, the door opened, and in
came the killer whales, young men and boys, dressed in blankets and
having long carved fins attached to their backs. Someof theseconsisted —
of a sheath in which a carved board was placed so that it could be pulled
out and dropped back by means of strings, thus giving the appearance
of a fin which was alternately lengthening and shortening. The men
came in stooping down low, so that the fins stood upright. They blew
like whales, turned in front of the fire, and slowly went to the rear of
the house, leaving the fire to their left, stopping and blowing on their
way. After they had made one circuit they disappeared again. Next,
a number of people came in, spreading their blankets and imitating
motions and voices of ducks. They went to the rear of the house. As
soon as all had assembled the people began to sing. Suddenly a man
holding his young son on his arms rushed out of the right hand rear
corner of the house, ran around the fire uttering the cries of the nu’L-
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 549

maL “hi, hi, hi, hi!” and pushing right and left with a dagger which
he was carrying. At the same time he smeared his son’s face with the
mucus of his nose, thus ‘“‘imbuing him with the sacred madness of the
ni’/LmaL.” The poor child was frightened, and cried piteously during
the ceremony. This was his initiation in the nu’/LmaL society. It
happened during an interval between the four songs which were sung
before the meal.

After the people had eaten, the bear rushed out of the same corner
whence the fool dancer had come. He was dressed in a bear skin and
came out on all fours, pawing the ground, growling, and looking wildly
upon the spectators. The people began to sing the first of his new
songs, and eighteen women danced accompanying the song, in order
to appease his holy wrath. The songs pacified him, and he disappeared
again in the corner of the house from which he had come and where
he is supposed to be initiated. After this the second course was served,
and then the people dispersed, each lighting his torch and wending
his way home along the dark street or down along the beach and up
the narrow bridges which cross the stream Jeading from the beach to
the street. Soon the glimmering lights disappeared in the houses,
where the fires were tended before everybody went to his bedroom to
enjoy the rest.

On the 19th of November the first ha/mats’a gave a feast of salmon
and berries. Early in the morning he himself, accompanied by the seal
society, went from house to house, their faces blackened, and dressed
in their various ornaments—the fool dancers with their lances, the
bears with their enormous paws. The fool dancers knocked at the
doors with their lances. Then they entered and invited the people with
the same words as are used at ordinary occasions. But they did not
raise their voices; they uttered the invitation in a low growling tone.
Whenever the name of a person was mentioned the meaning of which
in some way offended the bears, they pushed the speaker—one of the
fool dancers—so that he almost fell down. While the names were
being called, the members of the seal society looked around angrily.

Generally four calls are necessary to convene the people, but the
seals do not allow them to tarry. After they had called the first
time, they went around apparently offended by the tardiness of the
people. They carried a long rope, entered the houses, and the fool
dancers pushed the people from their seats with their lances. The
bear dancers scratched them and drove them towards the rope, which
was stretched tightly. Then the members of the society who held the
rope pushed the people out of the house on to the street. After hav-
ing arrived on the street, they drove them before the rope until they
reached the dancing house. Thus it did not take very long to bring
the people together. About 3 o’clock in the afternoon they began their
second call, and at 4.30 p.m. all the people were assembled. As the
host belonged to the Kwakiutl tribe, the Koskimo and the Na/q’oaqt6q
550 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

had the seat of honor in the rear of the house where the seal society
is generally sitting. The Kwakiutl sat to the right and to the left of
the door. The members of the seal society and the relatives of the
host were standing near the door tending the fire and preparing the
food. As soon as all the people were assembled, the seals placed two
logs in front of the door, over which they laid a plank. The ha/mats’a
and two fool dancers took their seats on the plank, thus preventing
any of the guests from leaving the house.

About this time HO/LElite, the speaker of the Gué’tEla, arose and
asked his debtors to pay his debts.' He said: “Now I beg you to
please me and to pay my humble debts ;? then calling the names of
those whose debts were due. One of the latter arose and promised
that all would pay on the following day. These debts had been con-
tracted a year before the feast, and therefore became due by this time.

Ho/Lelité continued speaking. In behalf of the seal society he
thanked the people that they had come to the feast. He called up four
men to distribute eagle down. Then they took up the down, which was
placed in four dishes, and put it on to the heads of the assembly. Now
he asked the people to sing and to beat time, and four young men
distributed the batons. The seals continued preparing the food, while
the Koskimo and Na/q’oaqt6q sang two songs each. The bears had
their paws on; the fools carried their lances while they were prepar-
ing the food. One of the bear dancers was being led by a rope which
was held by one of the fool dancers, in order to prevent him from get-
ting excited and attacking the people. During their songs one of the
Na/q’oaqt6q women danced in the rear of the house.

After they had finished singing, the speaker of the Na/q’oaqtoq arose
and said: ‘**The Kwakiutl do not look properly after the winter cere-
monial, But now they shali see that we know well how to arrange our
ceremonials.” He took off his head ring, called his cousin Qa/snomalas,
and gave him the ring, asking him'to go around the fire and to look
for someone who had no red cedar bark ornaments. Qa/snomalas took
the ring and went around the fire, turned once in front of the door, and
continued his way to the rear of the house. There he put the ring
around the neck of his cousin, NE’/msqemk-ala, who had just arrived
from the Na/q’oaqtoq village, and who therefore had not taken partin the
opening ceremonies, when everybody received his ornaments of bark.
As soon as he had received the neck ring, he arose and danced as

1ya/Xts’Alit qoqu’na— standing in the middle of the house asking for payment of
debts.

ha/mshamtsEs. After he had danced, his father, T’e’/t?ésumx:tsana, arose
and promised to distribute blankets. NE/msqEmk:ala’s wife asked her
speaker, Qoé/neqoiL, to speak for her. He held a silver bracelet in his
hands and promised in her behalf that she would give to her husband
four sticks of silver bracelets, ten bracelets to a stick, and button
blankets as many as were needed for a festival which he was going
to give. Then Qa’/snomalas took the blanket and T’e’t’esumx-tsana took
the bracelet. The latter spoke: “This is my way. No other clan can
equal mine; no chief can equal me. I always distribute all my prop-
erty.” Then Qa/snomalas interrupted him and said: ‘ Don’t say too
much! You have mademe your speaker and taught me not to mind others
in what I am doing. You have made me happy. Therefore I shall
sing.” Then he sang two songs which expressed his happiness. After
his songs he said: ‘That is enough. I sing two songs for what you
have promised me to-day. I shall sing four songs when you will
promise me a copper.” He thanked his uncle’s wife for considering the
noble position of her husband and helping him to keep that position. He
announced that he would distribute the bracelets and button blankets
among the four tribes of the Kwakiutl. ‘ Ya Koskimo,” he said, “ fol-
low this way, follow my way. Don’t lock up your boxes; keep them
open as I do. Thus I have become higher than any other man. I
always put my property into a box with red-hot bottom.' Let both our
tribes strive against the Kwakiutl, so that we may take off two finger
widths of their highness.” ”

By this time the salmon was done and was put into long flat dishes
and fish oil poured. upon it. The fool dancers and bear dancers
distributed the dishes and the wooden spoons, every three or four
people receiving one dish. The Koskimo and Na/q’oaqt6q were given
first, the Kwakiutl last. Etiquette demands that the guests eat as
quickly as possible. Whenever the bear dancers and fool dancers saw
a person eating slowly, they went up to him and pushed and scratched
him. During all this time a huge fire was being kept up in the middle
of the house and grease was poured into it. The flames leaped up to
the roof of the house, which every now and then caught fire, so that a

-man had to be sent up to extinguish it. It is considered improper for
the guests to mind sueh fires, and apparently no notice is taken of
them until the host deems it proper to send up to the roof. He some-
times disregards the fire until it has attained quite considerable dimen-
sions.

As soon as the people had finished eating, the chief fool dancer, who
is the eucekeye of the ha/mats’a, tried to deliver a speech. But it is

?The Kwakiutl are counted as high as four finger widths, as they consist of four
tribes. The other tribes are each only one finger width high. Of these, the Na‘q’oaqt6q
and Koskimo wanted to have each one, in order to become as high as the Kwakiutl.
552 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

customary to interrupt him. Whenever he made an attempt to speak,
the people raised a great din, which compelled him to stop. He pre-
tended to get angry and threw stones at the people. At this time he
ordered the members of the seal society, of which he himself is a mem-
ber, not to eat of the salmon, as a number of fish were set aside for
them. When a number of fool dancers and bears began to eat, not-
withstanding his commands, some of the other members of the seal
society took the food away and pulled them back. After all the guests
had eaten, a large dish was placed on the plank which was laid in front
of the door. The ha/mats’a ate out of the dish, while the other mem-
bers of the seal society ate out of large kettles which were standing
near the fire. Then all the people laughed at them because they ate
after the others had finished, although they are the highest in rank
among the whole tribe and ordinarily receive their share first. When
the people were teasing them, the friends of some of the members of
the seal society stepped before them, spreading their blankets, thus
hiding them from view, so that the people should not see them eating.

Now Ho/.eElité arose again and spoke: ‘This is the way of my chief.
He gives a large feast on account of the nobility of my tribe.” He
asked the people to take the batons and to sing. The Na/q’oaqt6q
commenced and sang two songs. The Koskimo followed with four
songs. In the fourth song the word “ raven” occurred. As soon as it
was heard, one of the ha’‘mats’as of the Koskimo became excited. He
jumped up, crying “hap, hap, hap,” trembling all over his body. His
attendants rushed up to him, the people beat time violently, and the
drummer beat the drum, while the ha/mats’a tried to rush up to the
people and to bite them. But he was held back by his six attendants.
Slowly he moved to the rear of the house, where he went once to the
left, once to the right, then continuing his course around the fire.
When he came to the door, he went out, followed by his attendants.
Then the Koskimo called four times, ‘“ yu!”

While this was going on, NEg-é’ts’é, speaker of the Koskimo, arose,
and as soon as quiet was restored, he spoke: ‘‘Take care, my tribe;
the supernatural power has entered our ha/mats’a Nau/aqis;” and turn-
ing to the Kwakiutl, he said: “ Be ready, friends, you on both sides of
the house; we will try to tame our ha/mats’a.” This was said at the
moment when the ha/mats’a ran out of the door. His attendants
returned after an absence of about ten minutes.

Now a number of large carved dishes were brought in, one repre-
senting a bear, the other a sea lion, and others other animals. They
were placed in a row in front of the fire. Then Ho/LElité arose again
and with him Ama/x-idayu, an old speaker of the Gué’tEla. Ho0/LElité
spoke, calling the host’s ba/xus name, NEm0/gwis, and pointing to the
bear dish said: “This is Nem0/gwis’s dish, which was used by the first
NkEm0’gwis when he gave a grease feast. Heused a dish like this one.
He also used this second bear dish and a wolf dish and a killer whale

—E—————
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 553

dish.” Then he called up NOo/La’auLEla, the father of NEm0’gwis.
“Speak yourself regarding your own dishes.” No/Lq’auLeEla called up
his mother, Mo’/sqEmXtLala. He asked her to give to his son some of
her father’s dishes. Then she pointed out a bear dish and a dish repre-
senting the sea lion’s stomach. He continued, asking her for some of
her mother’s dishes. Then she pointed to a killer whale dish and to a
wolf dish. He spoke: ‘*“‘ Friends, my mother has some more carvings,
but I do not want to give them to my son as yet. First I want to give
another feast; then I shall give them to my successor. That is all.”

Then HO’/LElité spoke again: “ Did you hear what my chief said?
He said that he wants to use the dishes before giving them to his son.
That means he is going to give another feast. Hu, hu, hu, hu, hu,”
and all the people repeated this cry. The fool dancers and bear dancers
took the dishes and carried them to the guests. H0/LElite called:
“This is the dish of the troublesome ones.'! This is the dish of Ts’E-
qolag-ilis.2. This is the dish of the cormorants.’ This-is the dish of the
rock cods and bears.‘ This is the dish of the whales for whom one
waits.’ This is the dish of the gulls.°. This is the dish of the pigs.”?

After all the large dishes had been distributed, the small dishes were
carried to the women and to the young people. While all were eating,
Ho’/LElité remained standing and asked the Kwakiutl to sing. They
assembled in the door, and after having placed a plank on two logs
they sang, standing, the feast song of the winter dance. As NEmog’wis
had no daughter, his grandmother and his father danced, accompanying
the song. |

After they had finished singing, HO/LElité spoke: ‘“ Ya, friends, this
is the way of my chief. He does so not only this time to show his great-
ness, but he always acts this way. Eat and swallow what is given to
you as well as youcan; eat it all. Bring our food and we will feed the
chiefs.” Then the members of the seal society brought a barrel filled
with berries and placed it in front of HO’/LElite. While carrying it they
cried, “U, U, U, U, U,” indicating that the barrel was exceedingly heavy.
Then they brought a number of large wooden ladles. Ho0/LElite dipped
berries out of the barrel, and said, ‘‘ Now sip, NE’/msqEmk:ala,”® and the
ladle was taken to him. He drank, and when he was unable to empty
it he poured the rest of the food into his dish. Thus the ladles were
carried to all the chiefs. After all had received their share, HO/LELiteé
spoke: ‘Oh, tribes! I do not do so once only; I often give feasts of this
kind. That is why we are called Kwakiutl—that means the smoke of

1Wu'n’awunx‘is, the society of the Na‘q’oaqt6q, which embraces the secret socie-

the world. All the tribes try to imitate us, but I have not seen anyone
who has been able to do as we do.” Then all the people said, ‘“ True,
true!” Next NEm0/gwis’s father, No’Lq’auLEla, spoke: ‘ Look at me;
look at my son! You shall not call me chief on account of what I am
doing, but call my son chief, because I am doing it for his sake. I am
working for him; I want to make him heavier all the time.”' Then he
asked one of the Na’q’oaqt6q chiefs, who had expressed his intention to
leave, ‘Is it true that you are going to leave? If you intend to do so,
wait four days longer, because my brother is going to give away
blankets within a few days,” and he continued: ‘ Ma/maléleqala! my
son isready for you. Heintends to give blankets to you. My brother-
in-law KuL&’m is also ready for you, and Aa/listalitsa intends to give
blankets to you.” Then the Na’q’oaqtoq, who intended to leave, arose
and said: ‘I wish there were two men like you in Tsa’xis (Fort Rupert).
You are the first who treated me well; you who asked me to stay here.”

November 20.—In the afternoon the Koskimo sent their messengers to
invite to a feast. About 6 p. m. the people had assembled in their
dancing house. First a Na’q’oaqt6q distributed blankets among the peo-

ple, and then one of their number arose, holding a copper in his hands.°

He spoke about its value, and said that he was going to buy it. Sud-
denly whistles and noise were heard outside, and the Koskimo ha/mats’a,
who had disappeared the preceding night, entered, accompanied by his
attendants. He danced around the fire once and disappeared again.
Then the speaker of the Koskimoasked the Kwakiutland the Na’q’oaqtoq
to sing. The Kwakiutl sang their two songs. The Na/q’oaqtoq followed,
but when in their first song they got out of time Ya’qois, the principal
hamats’a of the Kwakiutl, got excited. He jumped up, crying “hap,
hap, hap.” His nine attendants rushed up to him, and while he was
trembling violently they moved once to the right, once to the left behind
the fire, then around the fire, and when they reached the door, they
went out. During all this time whistles were heard proceeding from
the circle of the attendants. While the Koskimo chief was continuing
his speech the whistles and the howling of the ha/mats’a was heard on
the street. Soon he returned, dressed only with a dancing apron, two
rings of cedar bark worn crosswise over his shoulders, and a heavy ring
of red cedar bark worn on his head. The first circuit he danced in a
squatting posture. When opposite the door, he was for a short time
carried by his attendants. In the rear of the house he turned once.
The second circuit he danced standing, and the songs which were sung
during this time were in a five-part measure. His feet were put down
with the beats of the batons. The knees were lifted high up for each
step, while the trunk moved downward at the same time. After he
had gone around the fire twice, his father dressed him with a fine Chileat
blanket and an apron and leggins of the same make, with which he
made two more circuits around the fire. Then he disappeared, utterly

1That means he wants to make his ornaments of red cedar bark more valuable.

‘

exhausted, in one of the small bedrooms. During the dance he had
apparently become quieter and quieter as time went on. Then Ya/qois’s
father arose and distributed a few blankets which had been fetched
during the dance of the ha’mats’a. They were given as an earnest of
the blankets with which he promised to pay for the ecstasy of his son.

Now at last the Koskimo began to prepare the feast. While they
were engaged in this work, one of them shouted, all of a sudden:
“Listen! What is going on outside?” Everyone was quiet, and sud-
denly the roof of the house shook violently. At the same time a boy
was seen in the entrance of the house being wafted up and down. He
‘hung perfectly limp while he was flying to and fro. Then the people
pressed up to him and placed themselves so that the boy was in the
dark. Suddenly he had disappeared. After a short time his bloody
clothing and his head ring of red cedar bark fell down through the
roof, and a short time after the bloody clothing of a girl also fell down.
Then the speaker of the Koskimo said: “Three of our youths have
been taken away by the spirits. Now our winter ceremonial shall be-
gin.” Great excitement prevailed, as this was quite unexpected to the
other tribes. Then food was distributed, during which time speeches
of welcome and of thanks were made. This was the end of the festival.

November 21.—Early in the morning the old ha’/mats’a of the Kos-
kimo, with three attendants, was seen on the beach pursuing a number
of women. It appears that they had taken some of the food that was
intended for him, which had excited his wrath. He ran after them,
trying to bite them, and they escaped into the water, which the
ha’mats’a is supposed to dread. There he kept them for a long time;
whenever they made an attempt to escape, he tried to bite them and
drove them back.

In the evening the father of Ya’qois gave the promised feast, in
which he was going to pay for the ecstasy of his son. The blankets
which he was about to distribute actually belonged to his mother.’
When the people were assembled in the dancing house of the Kwakiutl,
she came in first, crying “hi, hu, ha,” which indicates the weight of
the blankets which she was going to distribute. She was followed by
the father of Ya’qois, who entered singing his secret song.! He was
followed by his son Ya’qois, the ha/mats’a, and by his sister La/stosalas,
who is the k-i/nqalaLala of the former. Then the members of his clan
followed, carrying the blankets which he was going to distribute.

The speaker of the clan Si’sinLaé axose and said: ‘Look at me,
friends, look at me well. This is my way of acting for my children.”
Then he turned to the Kwakiutl and said: ‘ Yes, my friends, here I am
again. I can not let you rest, for we must try to pacify our great

to the Na/‘q’oaqt6q and Koskimo, he asked them to help pacify the

ha/mats’a. He said: ‘We have tried to tame him, but we can not doit.

I am too insignificant as compared to him.” “True, trus,” said all the

people. Then they began to sing:

I have been all around the world eating with BaxbakualanuXsi wa

I give nobody time to escape me, going around in the house with BaxbakualanuX-
si/wae.

You BaxbakualanuXsi’waé, center of the earth, you were crying hap for me;

You BaxbakualanuXsi/wae, post of the world, you were crying hap for me.!

Ya/qois and his k-i/nqalaLala danced, accompanying the song. First
two songs were sung for the ha/mats’a, then two for the k-i/ngalaLala,
one of which was as follows:

I keep down your wrath, Great, real Cannibal!

I keep down your whistles, Great, real Cannibal!

I keep down your voraciousness, Great, real Cannibal!
You are always looking for food, Great, real Cannibal!
You are always looking for heads, Great, real Cannibal!
You are always devouring property, Great, real Cannibal!

Thon the speaker of the Koskimo arose and said: ‘“‘ Ya, Koskimo!
Ya, Kwakiutl, Ya, Na’q’oaqt6q. This here is my ha‘mats’a.? I sold a
copper for 1,000 blankets and he swallowed it.* I sold a copper for
1,200 blankets and he swallowed it. At another time I bought a cop-
per for 1,200 blankets and threw it into the fire for the sake of his
name. Now look out! I may do the same again this year. I want to
make him as heavy as I can on my part. His father is doing the same
for him.” Then Ya/qois’s father arose and the people shouted: ‘Speak,
Chief; speak yourself; not througha speaker.”> Thenhesaid: “Friends,
look at me; look at me well, because I want to tell you who I am!
This is my way of doing. Five years ago you heard much about what
I was doing. Then I gave my ha/mats’a first to Ya/qois. Ten times I
gave blankets to the Koskimo. I want you to come to my house ten
times this year, so that I may reach to the beams of my house. This is
not my way of doing. Chief Nrqa’penk’Em, my father,® and A’wate
taught me this way and I followed them. My name is 7a/qoag-ila on
account of the copper which I had from my grandfather. My name is
Qo/moqoe on account of the ermine and abalone shells which I have
from my grandfather. Do you want to know how I obtained my
ha’mats’a? I opened my box and took out my dances, which I received
from my brother-in-law, Q’uli’s.7 Therefore I am not ashamed of my
ha/mats’a. Now [ask you one thing—do not call me Gue’telabido.* It

is well when I live like one of you, and it is well if I act like one of the
northern tribe, because my mother was of high blood among her tribe.
I do not give this festival that you may call me a chief. I give it in
honor of these two who are dancing here, that the words of their ene-
mies may not harm them. Tor this purpose I build an armor of wealth
around them.” Then his speaker continued: ‘ You have finished. I
am proud of you. Yours is the right way of speaking. There is
nothing wrong in what you said.” Then he turned to the Na/q’oaqt6q,
addressing their chief, K-ak-xi/laso: “Did you hear what my chief
said? He did not speak against you; he did not speak against the
Koskimo, and he did not speak against us. He shall be the speaker
of the clan Se/nuEm.' Do not speak behind our backs, calling us
sons of northern tribes.?, Our ha/mats’a is making us tired. Now
take care! Look after your batons and speak carefully, and see that
food is given in the proper way to our great friend. He has many
fathers. If one of them has not enough property at hand, another
one is ready to pay for his ecstasies. Ho/LElite! Come and do what
you like with these blankets here. They fell from the red cedar bark
of Ya/qois.”

Ho’LeElité arose and with him Ama/x-idayu. He praised No’Lq’au-
LEla, the father of Ya/qois, and said: “ O Na/q’oaqtoq. This is the first
time that such athing is done. His property runs from him in streams,
and if one of his rivals should stand in the way he would be drowned
by it.” ;

Then he began to distribute the blankets, beginning with the ma’
maq’a of the Na/q’oaqt6q. Sometimes he did not know the proper
order and rank of the different names. Then he inquired of the people,
and they called to him, trying to help him. Some even threw stones at
him in order to attract his attention. After the first pile of blankets
had been distributed among the Na/‘q’oaqtoq, he took up the second
pile and distributed it among the Koskimo, beginning with their ha’
mats’a. After he had distributed all, he said once more: ‘“ Be careful;
the supernatural power never leaves our ha/mats’a; if you should make
a mistake, he will become excited again.” After his speech, the Na/q’-
oaqtoq and Koskimo sang a song on account of the distribution of
blankets, and one of the Koskimo said: “I begin to be afraid of the
manner in which we are being treated here. The property which is being
distributed here reaches up to my throat. I willnot blame No’/Lq’auLe#la.
My grandson is a ha/mats’a, and neither he has received a blanket nor
have I received one.” It so happened that his name had been forgotten
in the distribution. Then NO/Lq’auLela took the button blanket which
his mother was wearing and gave it to the speaker, who thanked him for
it. Next a Na/q’oaqt6q arose and said: ‘No clan has ever been known
to do what you have done to-day, and I am afraid of you. Kwakiutl,

558 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

you had a chief before this time, but now you have no chief.”! Upon
this all the Kwakiutl said: “True, true; we can not deny ‘t.”?

After these speeches were finished, food, which consisted of crab
apples mixed with grease, was distributed among the guests.’ When
the people had almost finished eating, one of the Na’q’oaqtoq gave a
button blanket to his son-in-law as a promise of a great number of
blankets which he was to give him at a later time. Then the recipient
thanked his father-in-law. He took his staff, which he held horizontally
on his shoulder, and which he carried as though he was loaded down
with the gifts of his father-in-law. Slowly he went around the fire
singing his secret song—a t’0/X’uit song, as he was a member of that
society. He turned when he came to the front of the house and when
he reached the rear of the house. While he was still singing, ali the
Na/q’oaqtoq singers assembled near the door. They held a plank to
beat time on and began to sing. The man danced while they sang.
After the second song, he put on the button blanket and danced,
accompanied by the third song. During the fourth song he took up some
burning coals and laid them before one of the men. This was to indi-
eate that he had power over the fire. Then he took another piece of
burning coal between his hands, rubbed it, and, swinging his closed
hands forward and backward, he all of a sudden threw them forward,
and as they parted the coals had disappeared. He had ‘transformed
the coal into a supernatural object which was to fly around the whole
world to see if there was a chief greater than his father-in-law. In
four days he said it should return and bring him answer. Then he
announced that he would keep the blanket which he had received,
and that he would not give it away, and the people replied: ‘‘Do as
you say.”

In the evening the Na’q’oaqtoq held their kue’xalak". When all the
people had assembled, the speaker thanked them that they had come,
and turning to his own tribe, he said: ‘‘Keep your batons in readi-
ness!” As soon as he had said so, the door opened and two men came
in wearing large blankets and imitating the motions of cormorants.
They entered by twos and threes and gathered in the rear of the house,
standing in a row. When all had come in, the speaker asked the first
of the birds: ““What is in your stomach?” He replied: “ Kwakiutl.”
Then he asked the next one: ““What is in your stomach?” He replied:
“Wour tribes,” meaning the four tribes of the Kwakiutl. Turning to
the third one, he asked: “What is in your stomach?” He replied:
“The Kwakintl, the Koskimo, and all other tribes.” When he asked
the next one, he acted as though he was vomiting. This means that he
was vomiting the property that was to be distributed at night. The
fifth one said to the epbeaiser that he had bgoue from tribe to tribe through

the whole world swallowing the tribes.'. After the speaker had asked
every one in this manner, he thanked the cormorants for coming, and
said: “I am glad that you are not light cormorants, but that ~ou are
heavy with property.”

Another signal was given to the singers to beat time, and in came
the killer whales. Thcy also entered by twos and threes. They had
fins made of wood tied to their backs, and came in blowing. They
moved in a bent position, so that the fins stood upright. Blowing, they
went around the fire, where they remained standing next to the cor-
morants. Now the speaker said: ‘‘Do you know why we open our
ceremonial with the entrance of the cormorants and of the killer
whales? In olden times, when Kuékuaxa/oe traveled all over the world
in his canoe Da/dana, he came to Goa/LgoaL’a‘lalis, where the village
of the Na/q’oaqtdq is standing. There the Na/q’oaqtoq and the killer
whales were living at that time. Kuekuaxa/oé left them and went to
Ya/xoestEm. After he had left, difficulties arose between the Na‘q’oaq-
toq and the killer whales. When Kuekuaxa’oé heard of this, he trans-
formed part of the whales into birds, others into sand. For this reason
the sand of the beach Goa/LgoaL’a/lalis is sounding when it is stepped
upon.”

After he had finished his speech, the women came in, dressed as birds.
They danced around the fire and stopped next to the cormorants and
killer whales. Then the speaker continued: ‘Do you know what this
means? The birds were living at Ya/xoestEm when Kuekuaxa/oe
arrived there. They were living inacave. Kuékuaxa/oé painted them
different colors. The crows and the cormorants wanted to be made
prettier than all the others, and waited until the last, but then they found
that Kuékuaxa/o0é had used all his paint and had only some charcoal
left, with which he painted them. Therefore they are black. After the
birds had been painted, they came dancing out of the cave. At that
time Kuékuaxa/oée’s canoe was burned. If you do not believe what I
said, Koskimo, come and visit me and I will show you the place.”
After this speech, the Na/q’oaqt6q distributed their blankets among
the Kwakiutl and Koskimo.

After this was done, a messenger entered the house and said: ‘‘Some
strangers are on the beach.” The speaker of the Na’q’oaqt6q sent a
man out, who took a torch and went down to the beach. Soon he
returned and informed the speaker that some white men had landed
and asked to be permitted to enter. The speaker sent for them, and the
inessengers came back leading a young Indian girl, who was dressed up
in European costume, with a gaudy hat, a velvet skirt, and a silk blouse.
Then they asked NO/Lq’auLEla what he thought of her; if he thought
she was wealthy. They asked him to send her back if she should be
poor. He looked at her and said: “I can easily distinguish rich and
poor and I see she is wealthy. Let her stay here.” Then the speaker

called swallowing the tribe.
560 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

looked at her and said: “Oh, that is Mrs. Nu‘le.” They led her to the
rear of the house and asked her if she carried anything in her pocket.
She produced a roll of silver quarter dollars, which the speaker took
and distributed among the people. By this time it was near midnight.

Now the speaker said: ‘‘Let us take up the object of our conven-
tion.” The festival was to be the initiation of a new q’0/minaqa.
About a fortnight before the festival the host’s daughter, who was a
q’o/minaqa, had died, and he wanted to let his niece take her place.
The festival was to be her initiation. She had been hidden in a secret
room in the rear of the house, and when the singers began the songs of
the dead girl she appeared wearing a blanket, dancing apron, a round
neck ring, and a high head ring which was covered all over with down.
She danced very slowly around the fire, accompanied by two attendants.
Her hands trembled. They were held horizontally forward, lightly
bent, her elbows resting on her sides. When she appeared, three
women began to dance in the rear of the house in order to appease her.
After four circuits she disappeared in her room, followed by her two
attendants and the three dancers. When the second song was struck
up, She reappeared and danced in the same manner as before. At the
end of the song she went back to her room. During the third and
fourth songs she grew quiet and danced like other women. When
she appeared for the fourth time, she wore a huge round head ring. She
was accompanied by an old woman, the aunt of the deceased girl, who
wore no ornaments, and whose disheveled hair hung loosely over her
face. This indicated that she was in deep mourning.

Soon after the end of the ceremony the song of a man was heard in
front of the house. He approached slowly. Now the door opened and
a naked person, wearing only an apron, and a head ring of red cedar
bark, arm rings, and anklets of the same material, appeared. He
Stayed in the doorway for a long time, singing his secret song. Then
he came forward, looking upward, his hands laid flat to the back side of
his thighs. With short quick steps he ran around the fire. The audi-
ence became restless, because they feared him, the ma/maq’a, the
thrower of sickness. When he entered, all the ha/mats’a had to leave
the house. As soon as he began his circuit, a man holding a rattle ran
up to him and followed all his movements. As soon as the ma/maq’a
came to the rear of the house he gavea high jump. The drummer beat
the drum rapidly and all of a sudden the ma/maq’a had caught his mag-
ical stick, which he held between his palms, drawing it out long and
Shortening it again. Suddenly he threw it into himself. The staff had
disappeared and he fell backward in frightful contortions. Blood came
pouring out of his mouth and out of his chest. After some time, he
pulled the stick out of his mouth, recovered, and continued his dance.
He tried to catch the stick again, looking upward and holding his
hands close to his thighs. As soon as he had caught it all the people
arose, and when he threw it, they stooped down, hiding in their
blankets and crying, ‘“‘wa.” The first time he threw his stick it did not

hit anyone, but when he threw the second time two young Na/q’oaqt6q
rushed forward, blood pouring out of their mouths. After some con-
tortions they lay there dead. The man who had accompanied the
ma/maq’a’s dance with his rattle was acting as though the stick had
entered his throat and was suffocating him. As soon as the ma/maq’a
had thrown the second time, he disappeared in the secret room in the
rear of the house. Soon he reappeared, singing over the dead, who
were carried into the secret room. Shamans were called, who sang over
them and cried “hoip,” while the ma/maq’a danced a third and a fourth
time, catching and throwing his stick, without, however, hitting anyone.
This was the end of the ceremony.

November 22.—In the morning the Koskimo held a secret meeting,
at which it was decided that Q’é’q’anqoala was to show the dance
Ba’baqoayuL (soul catcher). In this dance, which will be found
described on page 575, the dancer pretends to capture the soul of
one of the audience; but a certain amount of property is made. to
symbolize the soul. When therefore a dancer catches a soul, it means
that he takes away from the owner a certain amount of property, which
is to be distributed among the guests. Therefore the speaker asked at
this meeting: ‘Q’e’q’anqoala is going to show his dance. I want to
know if anyone wants him to catch his soul.” Whoever intended to dis-
tribute blankets offered his soul, saying: ‘ Q’é’q’anqoala, catch my soul,
for I want to give away blankets to our rivals.” The speaker thanked
them for their,offer. The soul is represented in the dance by a small
ball of eagle down, which is attached to a string. As many balls are
attached to the string at equal distances as there are men who offered
their souls to be captured.

In the afternoon the Kwakiutl held a meeting at the assembly place
in the woods, in which they laid out the plan for the kué/xalak", which
was to take place on the same evening. The Koskimo intended to have
a festival on the same day, but finally gave it up on account of the one
to be held by the Kwakiutl. The people assembled in the evening.
The Kwakiutl sat in the rear of the house—the Koskimo on the right
hand side on entering, the Na/q’oaqt6q on the left hand side on enter-
ing. The last to enter were the members of the seal society, who
took their seats in the last row in the rear of the house. The singers
sat in front of them, while the old chiefs occupied the front row. When
all had assembled, the speaker of the Kwakiutl arose and said: ‘“‘ Wel-
come, friends, on both sides of the house. We are all in our dancing
house.” And turning to the members of the seal society: ‘*Do not
go too soon, great friends.” Now turning to the Kwakiutl, he said:
‘Now be ready with your batons.”! As soon as he had finished his

speech, the two messengers who stood in the doorway said: ‘ K-éx:
and his sisters are coming.”' Then the door opened, and the members
of the killer whale society entered, surrounding the dancer, whose name
was K-éx:. He represents the Mink, and performs the dance which,
according to the legend, Mink danced after having killed the son of
the wolves. He had a red cireular spot surrounded by a black ring
painted on each cheek. He danced holding his palms downward and
raising them alternately to his eyes, as though he was hiding his face
behind his blanket. Another man, whose name was also K-ex-, who
was sitting in the rear of the house, began dancing when the singers
commenced K-éx’’s song:

That is, “* Mink put on his head the middle of the face of NoLq’olsElas.”

With the word ‘‘Qapama‘lo” of the song the dancer put his palms
vertically to his nose, indicating the long nose of the fool dancers.
They inserted in the song first the name of the fool dancer NOLq’olsElas,
who, as soon as his name was mentioned, tried to strike the dancer and
to stop his song. After his name they inserted those of No/L’it and of
Wa’xsqEmlis.

Then QElqéx:Ala, speaker of the G-é/xsEm, arose and said: ‘This is
done in rivalry with what the Na/q’oaqt6q did lastnight. They showed
us their legends; these are our legends. I do not need to tell them to
you; you all know how K-éx:, the Mink, killed the son of the wolves.”

Now the door opened, and four men dressed as policemen entered.
They were KuLb’m, MEsx:a’q, xE/lpatosEla, and G-:0/koya.

The last of these acted the judge and carried a book. He sent the

1G-a’xLig'a K-ex'ik: LO’/gwas wis’ waqoak:.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 563

policemen around asking if everybody was present, and KuLE/’m asked,
“Areall here?” The people replied, ‘‘ Yes.” Then the two other police-
men went around, looked at everybody, and stated that one person was
missing. They went out, and soon returned leading the old woman
Gudo’yo, whose hands were fastened with handcuffs. Then they pre-
tended to hold court over her on account of her absence. The judge
pretended to read the law on the case, and fined her $70. She replied
that she was poor; that she was able to pay in blankets, but had no
ready money. KuL&E’m, who acted the interpreter, pretended to trans-
late what she said into English, and the payment of 70 blankets was
accepted. Then the friends of Gudo’/yo turned against the judge and
said: “That is always your way, policemen. As soon as you see any-
one who has money, you arrest him and fine him.” She was unchained,
and the policemen went back to the door.!

They called K-éx: and his friends, the killer whales, and told them
to fetch the 70 blankets. The cousin of the old woman, who was the
speaker of the Maa/mtag-ila, told them where to go, and soon they
returned. Gudo/yo’s sister, Lé/mElxa/lag-ilis, followed them, dancing.
All the people were singing a ha’mshamtsEs song for her. The blan-
kets were distributed in her name. The ma/maq’a of the Na/q’oaqtoq
received his share first; then the other members of his tribe, and after-
wards the Koskimo, beginning with the ha/mats’a. While this was
going on, button blankets and bracelets tied to sticks were being carried
into the house. A G-e/xsEm, whose daughter had married Le/Lelalak",
a G-i’g:ilqam of the Kué’xa, was going to repay the purchase money of
his daughter. This ceremony is called “the brief qaute’x:a.” The
speaker of the G-e/xsEm, QE/Iqéx‘ala, arose and shouted: “Get ready,
Le’Lélalak",”? and called all the chiefs of the clan G:i/g:ilqam. Le/Le-
liilak" was sitting at the left-hand side of the door. Hearose and said:
“Did I hear you call my name?” “Yes,” replied the speaker, “your
father in-law is going to repay you.” ‘I wish it were true what you
said,”* remarked Le’Lelalak".

Then the speaker counted 39 button blankets and gave them to him,
saying that the fortieth was not quite finished yet; and he added:
“Here are 120 blankets; if your button blankets should not be enough
for all the guests, you may use these.” After he had spoken, K-a/qoe,
a speaker of the G-i/g:ilqam, arose, holding the speaker’s staff in his
hands, and said: ‘‘I will go and take the blankets.” With quick steps
he ran around the fire, turning in the rear and in the front of the house.
That meant that he was treading on all the tribes, because the Kwakiutl
rank highest of all. Then he struck the pile of blankets with his

staff. That meant he broke the canoe in which the blankets were
stored so that they fell into the sea, the sea meaning the other tribes.
Now he turned angrily to the Na/q’oaqtoq, and said: “Tam Le’Lelalak’,
who promised to give blankets to the Na/q’oaqtoq.”! After he had fin-
ished, QEIgéxala spoke again and gave Le’/Lelalak" the name which
was promised to him at the time of his marriage by his father-in-law.
He said: “Your name shall be G:a/lqEmalis;? your name shall be
QEm0’ta’yalis? (howling over all the tribes), and your name shall be
VemElxElag‘ilis* and SEDE‘Ixalag:ilis.”

Then Ne/msqEmiut, an old chief of the G-1’g:ilqam, spoke: ‘“* Now
you will be Walas’axa/ak".”* Immediately x‘1’x-eqala, chief of the
G-i/g-ilqam, interrupted him: “I am the only one who has the
Salis axa/ak". Do you want to know where I obtained it? Walas
Nemogwis and O’maxt’a’/laLé lived in K’a’qa. There he first came
down from heaven, there he had his dancing house, and since that time
it is called ‘ K-a/qa,’ or built on a rock. Come! Wa/xsqEmis, that we
may express our joy.” Wa/xsqEmis is a fool dancer, and as soon as he
was called he became excited, and ran around the fire in the fashion of
the fool dancers, crying “hi, hi, hi.” Then the people sang his song.
Now x‘i/x-éqala continued, turning to the other tribes: ‘TI will tell you
how strong my clan is: Here is the copper Ma’xts’olEmtséwuL lying
dead in the water off our beach. Here is the copper Ya/xyaxaqau’-

everybody expected that the ha/mats’a would get excited, and looked
at him anxiously, but everything remained quiet. X-i/x-éqala continued:
“That is the strength of my clan. None among all the other Kwakiutl
clans ever broke as many expensive coppers as we did.” With every
copper that he named he put his staff down violently, bending his knees
at the same time. Then he turned to the G-é’xsEm and said: “I thank
you for the button blankets and for the 2,000 bracelets,” and promised
at once to distribute the blankets among the Na/q’oaqtoq.

After he had spoken, Le’Leéelilak" asked his brother-in-law, ‘“¢‘ What
became of the 40 blankets which I gave you at the time of my mar-
riage to your sister? If you do not want to pay them, say so; but if
you do intend to pay them, let me know. Do as you have a mind to;
I do not care.” Then his brother-in-law replied that he was going to pay
in course of time. Lé/Léliilak" then promised to give the 40 blankets
to the Koskimo.

Now HO’LEIité arose and said: ‘“‘ You have finished. Now let us take
up the object of our convention.” The blankets were put aside. As
was stated before, the festival was to be a kue/xalak"—that means the
initiation into one of the lower ranks of the secret societies. The per-
son to be initiated was the son of Se’g-ag’ila, who had arranged this
feast. He gave his membership in the fool dancer society to his young
son. The people began to sing a fool dancer’s song. Then suddenly
a fool dancer rushed out of the right hand rear corner of the house
carrying his young son in his arms and crying, ‘wie’, wie’.”. At the
same time he cleaned his nose and put the mucus on the boy’s face.
This is done because it is supposed that the power of the fool dancer
is seated in the mucus. After he had run around the fire once he dis-
appeared again behind the curtain which was drawn in the rear of the
house. Ho0’LElité arose again and said: “This is NuLt’aqa/lag-ilis,”
thus naming the place which the boy was to occupy. The people sang
again, and a woman wearing the headdress of the Na/naqaualiL came
out. Another woman danced backward in front of her. A man carry-
ing a rattle accompanied her. This dance was not an initiation, but
only a representation of the dance which X:1/x-éqala had obtained from
his wife by marriage. After this dance was finished, a young boy was
to perform another Na/naqaualiL dance. He came out and danced once
around the fire, accompanied by one man carrying a rattle and three
others who watched him. He wore a head ornament with four horns.
After this dance he disappeared behind the curtain, and when the
second song commenced, a large mask representing the sunrise Na/x-
naik-émL appeared in the rear of the house, coming from behind the
curtain. It was a double mask, which in the course of the dance was
to open. When the wearer of the mask opened it, one side of the
cover broke. Although the attendants rushed up to the mask imme.
diately, trying to cover it, the ha/mats’a had seen what had happened
566 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and became excited at once, crying “hap, hap, hap.” The fool dan-
cers and the bears joined him. The ha/mats’a rushed down into the
middle of the house, the fool dancers struck and stabbed the people
and pelted them with stones, and the bears scratched them. The great-
est excitement prevailed. After a very short time the members of the
secret societies of the other tribes became excited too. The ha/mats’a
of the Koskimo jumped up trembling and erying “hap, hap.” The
Na/q’oaqt6g ha/mats’a followed, and so did the pa’/xala, who jumped
about the fire squatting and crying ‘‘mamamamamama,” which is the cry
of the ghosts. He took burning coals and firebrands and threw them
among the people. The women ran screaming into the bedrooms.
The Koskimo accompanied their ha/mats’a out of the house, and the
Na‘q’oaqt6q were driven out by their ha’mats’a. While this was going
on, some of the Kwakiutl were trying to rearrange the fire. According
to the rules, the members of the seal society ought to have broken the
right-hand side of the house first, the left-hand side next, and ought
to have driven out the people in this manner, the ha’/mats’a biting
the people, the fool dancers striking, and the bear dancers scratching
them. But it seems that there was some misunderstanding in this
case, and the house was not broken, although the excitement which
prevailed was very great. While the Kwakiutl were trying to rear-
range the fire, T’ét/ésumx‘tsana, uncle of the Na/q’oaqtoq pa/xala, ran
around the fire shouting “ naualakwai’!”! drawing the word out as long
as his breath would allow. As the people left the house, the noise
subsided, although the members of the seal society continued to rave
in the house.

After a while the Koskimo returned into the dancing house, four
men going first, each carrying a staff held in a horizontal position, and
each singing his own song.

They were Wina’lag-ilis. They led a young girl, who wore a head
ring. She was just initiated into a secret society.” Then two of the
speakers spoke at the same time. So far as it was possible to make
out what they said, they spoke about as follows: “This girl has been
the game of Wina’‘lag-ilis, who is hunting novices.” They led her
around the fire once and guided her behind the curtain. While she
was going around the fire, the Na/q’oaqtoq pa/‘xala pointed his staff
at the Koskimo. This, it is said, meant that he would kill them if
they did not bring a novice.

Now the Na/q’oaqtoq entered, first a ha/mats’a and two t’0’X’uit,
who held each other by the hand. When they came, the pa/xala, who
was all the time standing with bent knees, dropped down still lower.
Next, two ma/maq’as entered carrying a dead child in their arms.
T’o'péwa, speaker of the Na/q’oaqtdq said: ‘ Na/q’oaqt6q and Kos-

‘Spirit of the winter dance.

been wa‘tanEm four times they become members of the higher societies, the la/xsé.

kimo, you have a hard task; you must kick against a high moun-
tain.' Wina‘lag-ilis or Hai’aLilaqas has killed this boy, the son of
XExua/nElq’ala, the pa/xala. The supernatural power came and took
him away. Heis dead. We will try to resuscitate him.”

As soon as he said so, the ma’maq’a tried to throw the body into
the fire.” T’e/t’esumx-‘tsana and T’0’péwa pushed them back and
asked for assistance. Now they put the body down on top of a box
and T’o’/pewa asked the highest pa‘xala of the tribe to try to resusci-
tate the boy. Lo/Xoaxstaak" came and sang his secret song. Then
he spoke to the Kwakiutl: “Friends, if you have a mask for the
winter ceremonial which you want to show, do not let a stranger use
it; teach your own people to show it, that no mistake may occur.
Only because a stranger showed your mask a mistake happened and
brought about our great difficulty. Isay so, T’o’péewa.”* Then he went
around the fire singing. After he had made one circuit, the women
joined his song and a deep sounding whistle was heard, which repre-
sents the breath of the pa’xala. He sang four songs, and after every
song the whistles were heard. Every time it sounded the Kwakiutl
beat time and cried “hi, ha, hii, hi.” Then the boy began to move
again and pretended to come to life. This was the end of the festival.

When all was over, the ha/mats’a of the Koskimo appeared once
more and ran around the fire, followed by his assistants. Then he dis-
appeared again.

November 23.—Karly in the morning the Koskimo dressed themselves
to meet their novice. Two messengers went through the village and
asked the people to clear the floors of the houses and to sweep them.
They arranged themselves in two groups—first the wi/xsa, then the
la/‘xsé. One of the former carried a skin drum. The men walked
first. They were followed by the women, among whom was the new
wa/tanEm, who was initiated the preceding night. The men were
singing while the women were dancing. The wa/tanEm danced, raising
her hands alternately, her elbows close to her sides, the palms of the
hands upward. She had four feathers on her head ring. She did not
dance with the first song, but joined the dance during the second, third,
and fourth songs. The 1a‘xsa followed the wi/xsa at a short distance.
The men were singing, a woman beat a skin drum, and others, among
them another wa’/tanEm, were dancing. Thus they walked from one
house tothe other. A few hours after this the ha/mats’a was heard all of a

‘Meaning that they had to strive against the Kwakiutl.

2As all of this was quite unprepared, the ceremony was not carried out as it is in
other cases. If the performance has been planned beforehand, the maé’maq’as would
have provided themselves with a skeleton, which they would have carried in their
arms instead of the child. They would have threwn the bones into the fire, and
after the charred remains had been seen by the people they would have made them
disappear in a ditch made for the occision, and the boy would have risen at the
place where the charred bones had been seen before.

3He spoke in behalf of the latter and therefore used his name,

sudden on the beach west of the village, but soon he disappeared again.
Then the Koskimo walked behind the village, where the “breathing
hole” of the ha/mats’a is supposed to be. During this time he is believed
to be in the underworld. They went behind the village, thinking that
he might come up from underground. About 11 a. m., a man who had
gone into the woods west of the village to gather alder bark, was
attacked by the ha/mats’a of the Koskimo. In order to save himself
from the attack, he ran into the sea and walked home in the salt water,
pursued by the ha/mats’a. His cries soon attracted the attention of
the people. They ran up to the ha/mats’a and surrounded him. He
was naked, except that he wore a head and neck ring of hemlock
branches and a belt and apron of the same material.

After he had been caught, the Koskimo‘’sat down, and the song maker
taught them his new songs. After they had learned the songs, they
arose. The men took a long plank and beat time on it, while one was
carrying the skin drum. They sang the first two of the new songs.
The women went ahead, dancing in honor of the ha’/mats’a, who was
dancing in a squatting position. Thus they approached the village
slowly, going along the beach.

Finally they entered the dancing house, where the ha/mats’a danced,
accompanied by the first and second songs. Then he disappeared in
his bedroom with his attendants.

Now Lo/Xoaxstaak" arose and said: ‘ Now, friends, I will ask you
to help me and dance to-night with the new ha/mats’a which was given
to you, Toqoamalis, chief of the Koskimo, by the giver of the winter
ceremonial. I follow his law. All the ha/mats’as shall dance with our
new ha/mats’a. I do not know yet what his name is going tobe. I ask
you, Ts’a’qoalag-ilis; and you, Ta’/nisk-as0; and you, Qoa’ts’amya; and
you, LemElxa’‘lag‘ilis; and you, Na/noqois; and you, WéqoamiLa’lag-ilis.
Now you all must go and wash in the water of Baxbakualanu Xsi/wae
and put on the dress of the BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. That is all.”

Then T0’qoamalis arose and said: ““O my ebildren. I am glad to see
that you are obeying the laws that were given to our ancestors. You
know that if we make a mistake in this ceremonial, it means that our
lives will be cut short. When I was a young man, I have seen my
grandfather kill a man who broke the rules of the red cedar bark.
Thus I tell you A’Labala, and you LO’/Xoaxstaak". That is all.”

Most of the people now left the dancing house. All day whistles
were heard proceeding from the room of the ha/mats’a. The people
prepared for the dance that was to be celebrated that night.

The members of the seal society of the Kwakiutl had remained
in their dancing house since the preceding night. They were not
allowed to leave it until the approaching k-ik-i/Inala. The fool
dancers and bears however, were sent out every now and then to
get food. At other times they ran out of the house with their lances
and struck and scratched the people or threw stones at them. Some-
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 569

times the ha’mats’a, accompanied by some of the fool dancers and bears,
would leave the house and attack the people. In the afternoon all the
members of the seal society appeared on the roof of the house.
Every society howled its peculiar cries, the fool dancers throwing stones
at the people. During all this time the people were forbidden to pass
in front of the house. Whenever anyone approached the house, the
members of the seal society frightened him away. While they were on
the roof of the house, all standing at the front edge of the roof, a man
approached. Immediately the ha’mats’a and bears jumped down and
pursued him. The fool dancers climbed down the sides of the house,
and all went in hot pursuit until the man escaped into one of the neigh-
boring houses. Whistles of the different societies were heard in the
house all day long.

About half past six in the evening, Lagula’g:aliL and Lo’ Xuals black-
ened their faces, put on blankets and belts, head rings and neck rings
of red cedar bark, and strewed eagle down on their heads. Then
they left the dancing house and opened the door of the neighboring
house. There they stood,and Lagula’g-aliL cried: “Now, qué/qutsa
men and women, let us go into the house;” and Lo’Xuals added: ‘‘ We
will pacify our cannibal.” Thus they went from house to house. When
they had returned from the round, four young men went and called the
people, saying: ‘‘Now we come to make you rise.” While they were
still going around, some of the Koskimo gathered in the dancing house,
beat the boards, and cried “ya” twice, giving a short final rap with each
ery. As soon as the Kwakiutl heard the beating, they all went to the
dancing house. There the beating and the cries were repeated twice.

About 8 p.m. all had assembled in the dancing house. The men of
the Koskimo tribe were sitting in the rear portion of the house. Then
LoXuaxstaak", a Koskimo, arose and spoke: ‘Come, friends, that you
may see the manner in which I perform the winter ceremonial. This
was given to us byethe creator of our ancestors. Your ways, Kwakiutl,
differ greatly from ours. They were given to you in the beginning of
the world. Take care and do not change your old customs, Kwakiutl!”
Then he turned to his tribe and asked them to hold their batons in
readiness. While he was speaking he held his staff in a horizontal
position. Then Ho’LElite, chief speaker of the Kwakiutl, replied:
‘Your speech is good, friend. It is true what you said. I am glad to
see that you are adhering to the customs that were given to you;” and,
turning to the Kwakiutl, he continued, ‘‘ We must answer our friends.”

Now the rest of the qué’qutsa of the Koskimo entered—first G-a/loiL,
the chief speaker of the dancers. He held a speaker’s staff in his
hands and carried a number of blankets over his shoulder. He was
singing his secret song while the others were singing outside the house:
He sang as follows:

1. I tried to tame them by the power of my magic, friends.
2. I blew water upon them to tameethem, friends.
570 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

A second speaker followed, carrying his staff. His name is Ma/a.
He is the highest in rank of all the que’qutsa. When he entered,
G-a‘loiL stopped singing and Ma’/a commenced his secret song. At the
same time G-a/loiL addressed the people and said: ‘ Now look at me
and at my friend. Look at us, friends, at the other side of the house”
(meaning the Kwakiutl). And,turning to his own tribe, he continued:
‘Now take care, friends!” To which A’Labala, another speaker, who
stood next to LoXuaxstaak", replied: “Yes, friends, let us keep in
readiness. If we should make a mistake, we shall not escape the power
that will kill us.” During these speeches Ma/a sung his secret song, as
follows:

1. Ah, I have everything; I have all the dances of my enemy.
2. Ah, I have all the death bringers of my enemy.

Now a third man, a wolf dancer, entered. Two white feathers were
attached to his head ring of red cedar bark and his head was strewn
with white eagle down. His name was NaqwaLaye. As soon as he
entered, To/qoamalis and Lagulag:aliL, the chiets of the Koskimo, who
had been sitting in the rear of the house, arose, and with them their
speaker, Qoa‘lx:ala.

NaqwaLaye’s head ring belongs to the descendants of Ya/xstaL of
the Naq6/mgi lisala. According to tradition, the XOya/lEs (see also
p. 332) had killed all the G-ig-e/LEm, except Lé0Exmut and his three
sons, the eldest of whom was Ya/xstaL. In order to make his sons
strong, Léo1Exmut dragged them over the beach around the island of
G-igé/LEm, so that the sharp shells cut their backs. Only Ya/xstaL
survived this ordeal, and came to be of supernatural strength. Then
they went to make war upon the Xoya/lEs. When they had reached
Ta‘tsolis, a wolf came to their camp while they were asleep, threw
Ya/xstaL on his back, and carried him away. From time to time he
put him down, in order to see if he was still alive. When he felt his
breath, he took him up again and continued his course. Finally he
reached the village of the wolves. He threw Ya‘xstaL down in front
of the chief’s house and, having assumed human shape, he whistled.
Then many people came out of the houses to see who had come. They
mistook Ya/xstaL for a sea otter, carried him into the house, threw him
down, and began to cut him up. When they had cut down his chest
and were about to open his belly, he jumped up and asked: ‘ Will you
help ne to take revenge upon the Xoya/lEs?” The wolves promised
to help him, and asked him: ‘What did you come for? Do you want
to have this wedge? It will help you to build canoes in which you can
reach your enemies.” Ya/xstaL did not reply, but merely thought he
did not want to have the wedge. WiLaqa‘latit, chief of the wolves,
knew his thoughts at once. He asked: “Do you want the harpoon?
It will enable you to kill seals enough at atime to fill your canoe.”
Ya/xstaL thought that he did not want to have the harpoon, and Wita-
qa‘latit knew his thoughts. Then the wolves offered him the water of
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 571

life and the death bringer. He thought: “That is what I came for.”
Witaqa‘latit knew his thoughts and gave them to him. Then he
ordered the wolves to devour Ya/xstaL. At once they tore him to
pieces and devoured him. They vomited the flesh, and when Winaqa’-
latit sprinkled it with the water of life, Ya‘xstaL arose hale and well.
He had become exceedingly strong. Then they carried him home. He
was standing on the back of the largest of the wolves.

After he had come back, he and his father continued their journey.
While they were traveling, Ya/xstaL tried his death bringer. He moved
it in the direction of the woods. At once they began to burn. Now
they met the Xoya/les, who were coming up to them, many canoes full.
Lé01Exmut said to Ya/xstaL: “Now use your death bringer, but do
not kill them outright; burn them.” Then Ya/xstaL pointed the death
bringer at the Xoya’/lEs while his father was singing. They were
stricken with terror and jumped into the water, their canoes caught
fire, and they were all transformed into stones.

The two feathers on the head ring of the dancer represented the
death bringer of Ya/xstaL.

Next two couples entered, each couple hand in hand. The first couple
were ya/La (a man) and Po/wig-ilis (a woman); the second couple were
G-a/sa (a man) and G-o/qoadé (a woman). G-a/sa was carrying a cop-
per. The faces of these four persons were painted red.’

When they had reached the rear of the house, Ga‘sa spoke as follows:
“Oh, friends! turn your faces this way. Look at me! Treat me and
my cedar bark ornaments in the right manner. In former times I and
my people have suffered at your hands, Kwakiutl. We used to fight
with bows and arrows, with spears and guns. We robbed each other’s
blood. But now we fight with this here” (pointing at the copper which
he was holding in his hands), ‘‘and if we have no coppers, we fight
with canoes or blankets. That is all.”

To this the speaker Qoa/lx-ala replied: ‘True is yeur word, friend
G-a/sa. When I was young, I have seen streams of blood shed in war.
But since that time the white man came and stopped up that stream
of blood with wealth. Now we are fighting with our wealth. Thatis
all.” Then he said, turning to his tribe, ‘‘ Now, my singers, take your
batons and be ready to sing.”

Then they all began to beat time and cried “he.” They continued
with a song, for two women, Me’xas and Tsa/uLala, came in dancing:

,

Ah, magician, ah, ah, ah, magician, magician, magician. (Repeated ad infinitum.)

When the dance ended, G-i/sa spoke again: ‘‘ You have seen our two
friends dancing on account of this copper. Its name is ‘ Killer Whale.’
It is the property of my tribe, of the Koskimo. Now I will sell it to

1Up to this year the Koskimo, Na‘q’oaqt6q, and La’/Lasiqoala never used red paint
during the winter ceremonial. The qué/qutsa of the Kwakiutl have been using red
paint, and this has been imitated by the other tribes.
572 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

you, Kwakiutl. I promise to give its value to you Gué’tEla, and to you
Q’o’moyué, and to you Walas Kwakiutl, and to you Q’o’/mk-itis.
This is ‘Killer Whale.’ I want to sell it at once.” Thus speaking, he
gave it to Q’éq’anqoala and said: ‘‘Go on! Place this copper before
our friends.” He did so. Then a Kwakiutl chief, No’Lq’auLEla, arose
and spoke to Q’é/q’anqoala: ‘Bring the copper to me.” He did so,
and No/Lq’auLEla continued: “Oh, my tribe! my friends! Look at me.
I, No/Lq’auLEla, took the copper for the sake of your name, Kwakiutl,
because your name is above those of all other tribes and I do not want
to see it derided. Now, brother-in-law Nu’xnémis, look at me. I have
nothing with which to pay for this copper to which I have taken a
liking. Therefore I ask you and my wife La’msitaso to buy the copper
forme. That is all, friends!”

To this speech Ma‘a, the Koskimo, replied: “There is no chief like
you, No’Lq’auLEla. You are the first one to treat us well. You carry
your tribe on your back by the strength of your wealth.”

When he had finished, T0’qoamalis, chief of the Koskimo, took a pair
of blankets and spoke: ‘True is your word, Ma’/a! No’Lq’auLEla is
our chief, for he gave us more property than any other chief of the
Kwakiutl Go on, No’/Lq’auLEla! buy our copper,” and, turning to his
tribe, he concluded: “‘Thus I speak for our chief, Koskimo.” Now he
held up the pair of blankets and said: ‘Look at this, friend! This is
our good will to our friends on the other side” (meaning the Kwakiutl).
‘““T want you to do as our friend G-0/qoadé did who brought the copper
into our dancing house. Sell it for blankets and give them away! This
pair of blankets served to keep our copper warm. I took it off in
order to put it onto some of our friends on the other side. This is for
Ya/qois, Se%x, and HO’/LElite. Itis given by G-0’qoade, the daughter
of Ko’‘kwitala. That is all.”

Then Ma’‘a and G-a‘/loiL went out, and immediately the que’qutsa
began to beat time and cried “ya!” allatthe same time. When they had
done so, the whistles of the ha’/mats’a were heard on the roof of the
house. Then Ma/a returned, carrying a staff to which an imitation of
a scalp was attached. He was followed by G:a‘loiL. Both remained
standing at the door, one on each side, and Ma/’a said: “Friends, did
you hear that noise? If I am not mistaken, something dangerous is
near us. Keep your batons in readiness.”

While he was speaking the door opened and the ha/mats’a Ya/xya-
k-alag-ilis appeared, crying “‘ hap, hap, hap.” His face was blackened.
He wore a head ring and a neck ring of red cedar bark. His neck
ring was thin and set at two places with long fringes, indicating that
this was the first initiation of the new ha/mats’a. He wore no blanket.
He was accompanied by two attendants, who carried rattles. One of
them wore a large head ring of red and white cedar bark, the ring of
the ma’maq’a of the hélig-iliqala of the La/Lasiqoala tribe.‘

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 573

As soon as he entered the Koskimo began to sing:

. Your dance does not equal mine, for I am the giver of magic, hamé.

. I have been in the secret room of BaxbakualanuXsti' wae, the giver of magic, hamé.
3. In high eestasy was BaxbakualanuXsi’waé, the giver of magic, hame, when I was
near him and uttered his cannibal cry, BaxbakualanuXsi/wae, the giver of
magic, hame.

od

The second song was as follows:

1. Tam known here and all over the world, I the supernatural one.

2. Iam renowned here and all over the world, I the supernatural one.

3. You are the great one who gives coppers, who gives property, the supernatural
one.

While the people were singing, the ha/mats’a danced in the doorway
in a squatting position, turned around, and danced toward the rear of
the house. Two women danced for him, one to the right, one to the
left of the door. When he had reached the left hand rear corner of
the house, Ma/a and G-a‘loiL stepped forward and followed him, saying
now and then: “Great is your magical power. Do not be too violent
in your fury,” and the attendants cried “ hoip, hoip.” Whenever the
singers came to the end of a line, the ha’/mats’a stopped dancing and
cried “hap.” The attendants gathered around him while the sound of
whistles was heard.

After these two songs had been sung, Ma/a spoke: ‘“ Friends, we can
not pacify the great ha/mats’a with these two songs and by means of
the dance of these two women. Now arise, women, and dance with
him. If we should not succeed in pacifying him, we should always be
troubled by him. We should not be able to eat in our houses on account
of him. Therefore, friends, sing again.” While he was speaking, the
sound of the whistles continued to be heard. The ha/mats’a was cry-
ing “hap.” Then A/Labala stepped up to him and dressed him with a
black blanket and an apron and strewed eagle down on his hair.

Now the singers commenced the third song:

1. You are looking for food, great magician, you are looking for men, ma ha.

2. You are trying to eat as much as you desire, great magician, you tear off their
skins, ma ha,

3. You go close to the secret room, great magician, you have been inside the secret
room, ma ha.

During this song the ha/mats’a was dancing in a standing position.
His movements were becoming less violent and the sounds of the
whistles were becoming fainter. The cries “hoip” of his attendants, the
singing of the men, and the dances of all the women were beginning
to pacify him. At the end of the song the women took a rest. They
had been dancing, their backs turned toward the fire, with the excep-
tion of two who were standing at the sides of the door and who stood
turned toward the fire.

Now the speaker G-a/sa joined Ma’a and G-a/loiL, who were standing
near the door. Then the singers began the fourth song:

1. The chief cannibal of the whole world cried hap; mé, hama.

2. Now eat, chief cannibal of the whole world, mé hama,
3. Do not try to hide from me, mé hama,
574 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The ha/mats’a was dancing still more quietly, first to the right and
then to the left in the rear of the house, then around the fire. In front
of the fire he squatted down, crying “hap.” His attendants gathered
around him and shook their rattles, crying “hoip.” Then, with the
beginning of the next line of the song, he continued his dance, and |
after four circuits he disappeared behind the curtain which was
stretched in the left-hand rear corner of the house.

Then Ma/a, who was still standing near the door with his two com-
panions, spoke: ‘“‘ Friends on the other side of the house! Now our
great friend is pacified.” While he was speaking, KO0’/kwiLala, the
helper in the winter dance, swept the floor with hemlock twigs, in
order to prepare it for the following dances. ’

Then A’/Labala, who was standing in the right-hand rear corner of
the house, spoke: “Take care, friends on the other side of the house.
Watch my customs, for they were given to my tribe, the Koskimo, and
to the L’a’/sq’endx and G:0’p’éndx, and to you Gua’ts’endx, by the
Maker of the world. . Your customs, friends on the other side of the
house, differ from ours. They were given to you. I am glad to see
that you as well as we are observing our old laws. Now Tabala,
Ha/nk-ala, Tsa/xis, and LoXuals, go and fetch our chief’s blankets.”

The four men left the house, and soon they returned carrying the
blankets. G-a’sa took one pair and said: “ Ho’/LElité and Nu’xnémis,
look at these blankets. That is the power of our winter dance. The
ha/mats’a who just finished dancing is Ya/xyak-a‘lag-ilis, and these
blankets will be given away in honor of his name and of his dance.”
Then he gave the first blanket to Ya/qois, the chief ha/mats’a of the
Kwakiutl, and then to the other men in order. When all were dis-
tributed, Ho/LElite spoke: “ Friends, did you hear what G:a/sa said?
Everything he said is true, except one remark, in which he is mis-
taken. You said that your customs in regard to dances and festivals
differ from ours; remember, we are all of the same name. That is all.
Thank you for this red cedar bark that you gave us (meaning the
blanket). Now I have finished.”

Then Qoa/qoaxst’ala walked around the fire, apparently without any
purpose, but in fact as a signal for the dancers, who were standing out-
side the house, to enter. The door flung open, Ma/a, G-a/loiL and
G-a’sa, who remained standing near the door, gave a signal to the
singers, who began to beat time very rapidly. A song was heard out-
side the house, and now a dancer, K’ue/daqala by name, entered with
quick, short steps, his hands stretched backward under his blanket,
his face blackened. He was both ma’maq’a and ha’mshamtsEs. As
soon as he had come to the rear of the house, the singers ceased beat-
ing the boards. Ma/a said: ‘‘ Thank you, friend, for coming to this
dance.”

Then G-aloiL gave another signal, and a female dancer, T’é’La by
name, entered, her hands stretched forward, Again the singers stopped

beating the boards. G-a/loiL gave another signal, and a second
woman, G-a’/lg-amqas by name, entered, and danced in the same man-
ner. She stepped up to T’e’La, and the singers stopped beating the
planks.

Then G:-a/sa spoke: “ Friends, look at these two women. They are
the mothers of my tribe. They carry all the winter dances. Whenever
these two appear, we must be on the alert, for they are always followed
by other dancers.” When he had finished, LoXoaxstaak" told the
people to be careful, because he had heard the voice of Q’é’q’anqoala, the
Ba’/baqoayutL (soul catcher).!

As soon as he entered, all the dancers stooped down as though they
were trying to hide, for fear that Ba/baqoayttL might take their souls.
His aunt, Po’sqaas, took a position to the left of the door, and while he
was walking around the fire she danced the ha’mshamtskEs dance.
When he came back to the place in front of the fire, all the people
arose and he lifted his hands, the palms being held close together.
This was repeated four times. When he stopped the fourth time in
front of the fire, he opened his palms and the “soul” was seen between
them. The speaker told the singers to stop beating the boards, and
Ma/a went about among the people in order to find whose soul the
dancer had caught. After a short while he turned to the people and
said: “My friend Q’é’q’anqoala has captured the soul of our chief
La/qolag‘ilis.” Then the latter stepped forward and asked the singers
to sing the song of Q’e’q’anqoala and of his aunt PO/sqaas.

They sang as follows:

1. I go to obtain your cedar bark ornaments, ha, your cedar bark ornaments, hamé
me, hamé, hamé, hamé hé hama he hé hama.

2. Now your dance will shine throughout the world wherever a winter dance is held;
Giver of light, hamé me, hama.

During this song the Ba/baqoaytL was dancing on one spot in
the rear of the fire in a bent position. Po’sqaas was dancing the
ha/mshamtsEs dance to the left of the door, and G-a’/sa and G-a‘loiL,
the greatest ma’/maq’a among the Koskimo, danced around the fire,
their elbows held close to their sides, forearms held forward, hands
closed, and thumbs stretched upward.

At the end of the dance La’qolag-ilis spoke to Q’e’q’anqoala: “Come,
my son! I thank you for bringing back my soul, for I am saved now.”
Then he called the two chief speakers, A’/Labala and L0/Xoaxstaak",
They followed his summons, and he gave them a stick about 2 feet
long. Lo/Xoaxstaak" held it up and said, ‘“‘ Oh, friends on the other

1This is a t’0’X’uit dance of the G'0/p’én6x. The dancer is supposed to be able to
catch the absent souls of people. He dances, his palms held close to the body, like the
ma/maq’a. (See p. 560.) A string is fastened to his middle finger and a small ball of
eagledown is fastened to the middle of thestring. When he opens his hands, the ball
is seen in the middle between them, the ends of the string being tied to the middle
fingers. It represents the soul that the dancer has captured. The details of this
dance are described in the text. (See also p. 561.)

side. I am glad that we have someone who can catch our souls when
they fly away from us. Now I will pay you, Kwakiutl. Thus I speak
for La/qolag-ilis. Here are blankets for you, Gue’tEla. Here are blan-
kets for you, Q’O/moyué; blankets for you, Walas Kwakiutl; blankets
for you, Q’o/mk-utis. This is a canoe worth 100 blankets, given by
Q’e’q’anqoala, the son of La/qOlag“ilis.

To this La’‘mg:ala, a Walas Kwakiutl, replied: ‘‘Thank you for your
good words, A’/Labala. Did you say that you have someone who under-
stands to catch the souls of men?” “Yes,” shouted many of the
Koskimo. He continued: “Thank you. We might need your help.”
Then, turning to the Kwakiutl: “‘ Friends, I ask you to keep yourselves
in readiness, for the Koskimo are like to a vast mountain of wealth, from
which rocks are rolling down all the time. If we do not defend our-
selves, we shall be buried by their property. Behold, friends! They
are dancing and making merry day after day. But we are not doing
so. Remember, this is our village and our battlefield. If we do not
open our eyes and awake, we shall lose our high rank. Remember,
Kwakiutl, we have never been vanquished by another tribe. That is
all.”

Now a loud clapping was heard outside the house. The walls were
beaten with sticks, and Ma/a gave a signal to the singers to beat the
boards. The door opened and a man entered, the chief gué’/so, fol-
lowed by four other members of the group.' They hopped into the
house holding their feet close together. When they had reached
the rear of the house, Ma’a, who was holding a gun in place of a
speaker’s staff, spoke: ‘Friends, why should you not come to join our
dance?” and, turning to the Kwakiutl, he continued: ‘Friends on the
other side, these are our friends the ‘Pigs!’ Formerly they were
‘Sea Lions.’ Thisis toinform you.” Next, LoXoaxstaak" said to the
chief singer, Qoa/qoaxst’ala: ‘Look out! our friends are very merry
and they wish to dance.” The maa/myaénox” commenced a song, which
was taken up by the singers:

1. What is on the enemy’s blanket? Wiée.
2. War is on the enemy’s blanket. Wieée.

The women arose and danced, raising their forearms and holding up
their first fingers. This song and dance were repeated four times. At
the end of the song the singers beat time very rapidly and then the
ha’mats’a’s ery “hap” was heard in the secret room.

This song and dance were given by the wolves to Ya’/xstaL, and are
used by his descendants to excite the ha/mats’a and warriors who go
out to battle.

When the singers commenced the song for the third time, G-a/loIL, who

gué’guso (pigs) while formerly they were called L’é’LéxEn (sea lions).

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 517

represented Ya/xstaL himself, joined the dance of the women. He
jumped about in a circle in the wildest fashion. Then the ha/mats’a’s
cries “hap,” and the quieting calls of his attendants, “ hoip,” were
heard.

After the song and dance had been repeated a fourth time, Xule/qulels,
a G:6/p’énox, and his speaker, Hé/g:ilaxse’k-a, arose. The latter took
up some blankets and spoke: ‘Yes, friends on the other side!
Kwakiutl! I have my ways of celebrating the winter ceremonial, and
you have your own, different from mine. Thus it was given to you by
the Giver of Dances. I should like to have your dances, but I am
afraid to change my ways, for they were given to me in the beginning
of the world. This song which we just sang was given by the wolves
to Ya/xstaL at 9a/yaiL when he received the death bringer with which
he was to burn his enemies or to transform them into stone or ashes.
Weare of Ya/xstaL’s blood. But instead of fighting our enemies with
his death bringer, we fight with these blankets and other kinds of prop-
erty.” Then he distributed the blankets among the Kwakiutl.

Next, two young men whose faces were blackened stepped forward,
and one of them said: ‘‘I am going to look for my friend.” He went out
and brought an old woman to the middle of the house, where she sat
down. Qoa’qoaxst’ala said: “Take care, friends! this woman is going
to dance. Prepare to sing her song.” Then the singers beat the boards
rapidly and eried ‘“‘yu.” The beating and the cry were repeated at a
given signal. As soon as the second cry died away, another ha/mats’a
was heard outside the house.

A‘Labala, who had left the house a short while ago, reentered, stood
in the doorway, and spoke: ‘Look at me, friends! Nowtakecare! I
have seen something outside the house that looks as though it was not
going to have mercy upon anybody. Thus I tell you. Now beat the
boards!” Then the singers began to beat time, the door opened, and
the ha‘mats’a entered crying “hap, hap, hap.” At once everybody
commenced to sing his or her secret song. A/Labala went up to the
ha‘mats’a with short quick steps and then back again, saying: ‘‘Come
friend, that this great tribe may see you.” Then he turned around
and said: “This is Ts’a/qoalag-ilis, our chief ha/mats’a. Take care,
friends; he devours property, not flesh of men.”

Now the ha/mats’a came down to the middle of the house. He wore
a head ring of red cedar bark, to the back and front of which branches
of balsam pine about six inches long were attached crosswise. His
neck ring was worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm. It
was made of red cedar bark wound with branches of balsam pine. The
women began to dance for him. He danced, squatting, toward the
rear of the house, and was joined by the old ha/mats’as, Ta/nisk-aso,
Qoa’ts’Emya, LémElxalagilis, Na/nogois, and WeqoamiLaag-ilis, who
entered one by one, crying “hap.” Finally they reached the rear of the
house, where they remained standing in a row, their backs turned

toward the fire. Then the door opened and the new ha/mats’a, who
had been brought back in the morning, entered, crying “hap, hap,
hap.” He’wore a head ring made of balsam pine, to which a long
plaited trail of the same material was attached. The trail reached
down to the small of the back. Three white rings about one inch in
diameter, made of cedar withs, the bark of which had been stripped
off, were attached to the ring over his forehead and one on each side,
allon the same level. Another ring of the same material was attached
to the trail. He wore an apron made of balsam pine; his neck ring,
arm rings, and anklets were made of the same material. He was held
by one assistant.

As soan as he entered, the singers began to beat the boards, and con-
tinued until he had come down to the floor. Then they began to sing
his first song:

. He cried hap for me, the only great being in our world.

. BaxbakualanuXsi/waé cried hap for me, the great cannibal of our world.
. BaxbakualanuXsi/wae taught me to devour lives, the great cannibal of our world.

Cb

He danced to this song, and Ts’a/qoalag-ilis, the chief ha/‘mats’a,
danced forward to meet him, cried “hap!” and attacked the people.
After this song Lo Xuaxstaak" arose in the rear of the house, holding.
a copper, and a woman named Ayagqa, brought a strip of calico about
40 yards long, which was unrolled and spread in a circle around the fire.
Then the singers began the second song:
I give you to eat, I give you to eat, good cannibal.
. L pacify you with property, I pacify you with property, good cannibal.

3. I push down your wildness, I push down your wildness, good cannibal.
4. I give you lives to eat, I give you lives to eat, good cannibal.

Ne

The ha’mats’as were dancing between the calico and the fire in a
squatting position. Their attendants tried to pacify them with cries of
“hoip,” and women danced for them. Then A/Labala stepped forward
and asked the singers to wait before beginning the third song. He
called his speaker, T0’/qoamalis, who took his position in the rear of the
house, and addressed the people as follows:

“Yes, my children, I am the storage box of your thoughts, for I
remember all the old tales, and in my young days I have seen things
which you young people never heard of. It is good that there is one
old man who can show you all these things. Now I will go to this
ha/mats’a and take off the dress that BaxbakualanuXsi/wae put on
him.” He stepped up to the ha/mats’a, who was standing in the rear
of the house, and took off his head ring first, then his neck ring. He
cut off the arm rings and anklets and gave them to LamaLa. Then he
asked Nau/agaia to bring blankets and ornaments made of red cedar
bark. Nau‘aqala went to fetch them from his bedroom, and when he
had returned, To’qoamalis proceeded to dress the ha/mats’a. He put the
blue blanket over his back and cedar bark ornaments on his head,
his neck, his arms, and around his ankles. He also tied a dancing

apron around his waist and strewed eagle down on his head. Then
he said, ‘‘It is done.”
The young ha/mats’a cried “hap, hap, hap,” and attacked the people.
Now the singers began the third song:
. The cedar bark of the winter dance is all around the world.
. The eagle down of the winter dance is all around the world.

. The songs of the winter dance are most powerful all around the world.
For me cried hap, BaxbakualanuXsi wae, the great magician.

ran

During this song all the ha’mats’as were dancing in standing pos-
ture and the women were dancing for them. At the end of the song
they all stood in the rear of the house.

After a short while the singers beat time again and commenced the
fourth song of the ha/mats’a:

1. Nobody can imitate your cries, great BaxbakualanuXsi wae, great magician,
hama ma,

Nobody ean imitate your aance, great BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, great magician,

hama ma.

2, Twas taken into the room of BaxbakualanuXsi wae, the great magician, hama ma,

’ T received the red cedar bark of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae, the great magician,
hama ma.

3. He put into me all the dances, BaxbakualanuXsi’wae, the great magician,
hama ma.

3. The cannibal pole is shaking, the pole of BaxbakualanuXsi’ wae, the great magi-
cian, hama ma.

When the song was nearly ended, the ha/mats’as disappeared in their
secret room, led by Ts’a/qoalag:ilis.

Then Lo/Xuaxstaak" stepped forward, still holding his copper, and
spoke: ‘Now that is the end, friends. You have seen my way. This
is my way.” With this he pointed to his copper. ‘This is the price
of a ha/mats’a. I donot mean you, Kwakiutl; | mean my rivals in my
own tribe. They all want to have ha/mats’as, but they want to show
them cheaply without giving away a copper.” The Kwakiutl inter-
rupted him now and then with cries: ‘That is true! your words are
true,chief!” Lo/Xuaxstaak" continued: “Our ha/mats’a touched some
of you, Kwakiutl, in his excitement and hurt you. This copper, the
face of which is engraved with the design of the grizzly bear, is worth
500 blankets. It is to pay those whom our great friend has bitten.
You, La/msitaso, were bitten this morning. Here are 50 blankets of
this copper for you; and you, Ho/lelité, 50 blankets of this copper tor
you; and you, G-a/lg-alX6la, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and
you, No/Lq’auLkla, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and you, K-ex-,
50 blankets of this copper for you; and you, Qa/wiqam, 50 blankets
of this copper for you; and you, Nu’xnémis, 50 blankets of this cop-
per for you; and you, Mé/qoadaxstala, 50 blankets of this copper for
you; and you, K-a/qoe, 50 blankets of this copper for you; and you,

ha/mats’a, for the tribes say we own neither ha’mats’a nor otner dances.
That is all.”

Then Qoa/yuqoalag-ilis came forward. The Koskimo placed a box
for him in the rear of the house. He sat down and began:

‘Be quiet and listen to me, for I am going to tell you the story
of this ha/mats’a, which will show you that we, Koskimo, G-o’p’endx,
L’a/sq’enox, and Gua‘ts’endx, do not steal winter dances from you,
Kwakiutl, nor from other tribes. All the winter dances were given to
us by the Maker of Man in the beginning of the world. ‘The ha‘mats’a
whom we have seen to-night comes from Hai/alik-awe. All the clans
Hahai/alik-awé of all the tribes in the whole world have aright to a
ha/mats’a with raven whistle, for Hai/alik‘awe had a ha’mats’a with a
raven whistle at the place which we name Lala’t’e, and his ha/mats’a’s
name was Qa/yuL and Qalama‘lagvilis. We may use either of these
names for our ha/mats’a. We will call him now Qa/yut, and if he
should be taken away again by Baxbakualanu Xsi/wae, we will call him
Qalama‘lag-ilis. You, Kwakiutl, you always use hemlock branches for
your ha/mats’a, for it was given to you in this manner by the Maker
of Man. It was given to us to use balsam pine for our ha’/mats’a and
for all other dances. The white rings you saw on the head ornaments
of our ha/mats’a are the same as worn by BaxbakualanuXsi/wae when
he was excited. The attendants passed ropes through these rings to
tie him down, that he might not leave his house and devour his people;
and the trail of his ornament served for his attendant to hold hin.
You also saw the streaks of blood running from the corners of his mouth
to the lobes of the ears. They indicate that BaxbakuaélanuXsi/wae
lives on nothing but blood. ‘That is all.” :

He had hardly finished when Lo/Xoals, a Koskimo, came forward
from the rear of the house holding a single blanket. He spoke: ‘‘ Look
at me. See this single blanket! I am tired of waiting so long at this
place for one solitary single blanket. Now I will show you that I do
not care for a single blanket.” He tore it, threw it into the fire, and
continued: “Now you who saw it in the fire take good care to keep
it warm. All single blankets will go there hereafter. We are too
great a tribe to receive only a single blanket each.” Then LamaLa
went up to him and stopped him. He held six button blankets and
said:

“Friends on the other side! Each of us has something to say.
Lo’/Xoals has had his way when he wanted to burn this blanket.
Kwakintl, he did not mean you. Do not feel offended by it. I have
rivals in my own tribe and I must wake them up from their sleep, for
they do not see that it is hard work for us to fight you with property.
We are the Koskimo, who have never been vanquished by any tribe,
neither in wars of blood nor in wars of property. Now I will ask you
one thing: Treat me well. Of olden times the Kwakiutl illtreated my
forefathers and fought them so that the blood ran over the ground.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 581

Now we fight with button blankets and other kinds of property, smil-
ing at each other. Oh, how good is the new time! That is all. Now
to these button blankets. Son-in-law, come and stand where I can see
you.” Then Nau/aqala stepped to the front of the house and said:
‘Here I am.” LamaLa continued: ‘I understand that you have no
button blankets. Therefore, I thought I might bring you some. Here
are six button blankets. I took them from your wife’s back. Now
come and take them, and do with them as you please.”

Nau/‘aqala asked: “What did you say, my father-in-law?” Then
Lamata repeated: ‘I told you, son-in-law, that I had taken six button
blankets from the back of your wife and I give them to you. Now
come and take them.” Nau/‘aqala spoke: ‘IT will go, for I am not afraid
to go and take them. Ihave given away button blankets three times,
and this will be the fourth time. Now I will go and take them.” Then
he went back to his place and said, turning toward the people: “Oh,
my tribe! look at these button blankets and see what I am going to do
with them. One of you shall tell me what to do with them.”

To this the old woman who was standing near the door replied: “ My
tribe, | want to say a few words to you, and particularly to my son, who
asked to be told what to do with these blankets. Iriends, you all
know my name. You knew my father and you know what he did with
his property. He was thoughtless and did not care what he did. He
gave away or killed slaves; he gave away or burnt his canoes in the
fire of the feast house; he gave away sea-otter skins to his rivals in
his own tribe or to chiefs of other tribes, or he eut them to pieces. You
know that it is true what I say. This, my son, is the road your father
laid out for you and on which you must walk. Your father was no
common man; he was a true chief among the Koskimo. Do as your
father did. Hither tear up these button blankets or give them to our
rival tribe, the Kwakiutl. That is all.”

Lo’Xoaxstaak" arose when she had finished and asked: “Did you
hear what our aunt said? I will not block the road my father laid out
for me. I will not break the law that my chief laid down for me. I
will give these button blankets to my rivals, the Kwakiut]. The war
that we are having now is sweet and strong.” Then he gave the but-
ton blankets to the Kwakiutl; first to Ya/qois, then to the old chiefs.
After they had been distributed, Lo’ Xoaxstaak" said: ‘These button
blankets are the red cedar bark that I have taken from the head of my
ha/mats’a. Next the men brought him 40 white blankets, and he said:
“These white blankets are the red cedar bark that I have taken from
the neck of my ha/mats’a and Lam going to give them to you, Kwa-
kiutl.” He distributed them among the next in rank. Then he took
the calico and said: “¢This is the red cedar bark that I took from the
arms and from the legs of my ha/mats’a. I will give it to the women
and children of the Kwakiutl.” They tore it up, and gave the pieces

to the Kwakiutl—first to Ya’qois, then to the others.
582 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

With this the festival ended, and the people went home. It was
about 1 a. m. when the calico was distributed.

About 7 p.m., November 23, HO/LELité sent two messengers, NOLElag’-
ilis and KuL&’m, to call all the men of the Kwakiutl tribe to a secret
meeting to be held in his house. The messengers went into all the
houses and called the Kwakiutl, whispering into their ears. They
slipped out at once and went to Ho’LElite’s house. Great care was
taken that the Na/q’oaqt6q and Koskimo should not know what was
going on. As soon as the men were assembled, Ho’/LEIité arose and
spoke: “Indeed, friends, you have gratified my wishes, for you all
have come as soon as I sent for you. Iam glad that you are keeping
the laws that were handed down to us from the times of our grand-
fathers. You will have observed that the Koskimo are likely to beat
us in our war with property. Therefore I ask you not to be asleep,
else the Koskimo will surely walk right over us, friends! Wake up
and open your eyes. Do not let the wealth of our rivals blind you.
Our ancestors have never been vanquished. I do not want to see the
Koskimo vanquish us now. I have called you in order to inform you
that my chief Sé’g:ag’ila is going to give a winter dance, and I will ask
you, my friends, how we shall begin it. I want you to decide in regard
to the manner of beginning the ceremonial. That is what I wanted to
say to you, wa, wa.”

The men remained silent for about twenty minutes. Then Nu/xnémis,
the chief of the winter dance of the Kué‘xa, arose and said: ‘Indeed,
Ho’LElité, you are always keeping the rules laid down in the times of
our ancestors, for instead of begitining the ceremonial without notify-
ing us, as others might do, you tell us of your plans and secrets as our
forefathers used to do; and that is the right way.” Then he turned to
his own tribe the Kue’xa and said: ‘Don’t you feel glad that my friend
Ho‘uelite, the great magician, was kind enough not to keep his secrets,
but let us share them? You also, La’mg:ala, ought to feel proud that
he invited us to know of his plans. Do you not think that it would
be best if the clothing of Wina‘lag-ilis were brought out by this secret
meeting? You all know what I mean. The clothing of Wina‘lag-ilis
consists of hemlock branches, and his play is AmE/lk" or NuLanuLdeEls.
The AmE‘Ik" must be shown at daybreak, and the Nunanttdels may
be shown at any time of the day. I think it would be best to surprise
our rivals, the Koskimo. Let us call all the men and women before
daybreak to-morrow and go to the meeting place which our forefathers
used for the AmE’1k", You all know the rules of the AmEk". That
is all. Now I have finished.”

Then Ho’LElite replied: “Thank you, my friends. Thank you,
Nu’‘xnémis, for what you said. You are the only one who wants to
keep the rules that were given to us by our ancestors. Friends, I want
to ask you one favor: Arise before daylight. Tell me now if you are
willing to do so and to follow our friend Nu’/xnémis’s advice. Let the
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 583

women of your households know about this secret meeting and keep it
from our rivals, the Koskimo. I will send two messengers in the
morning to call you by tapping at your bedrooms. That is all. Now
go home and have a short sleep.” After this speech all went home.

November 24.—Karly in the morning HO0’LElité sent NOLElag-ilis and
KuLkE/m to call all the Kwakiutl. They went around and tapped at
the outside walls of the bedrooms. ‘The people arose at once and went
out to the place where the AmE‘1k" is held. This place is about 150
yards from the east end of the village at the edge of the woods. The
men went into the woods and cut off hemlock branches, from which
they made head rings and neck rings; with these they adorned them-
selves, as well as the women. Then Nu/xnemis told the people to get
ready for the first ery, and he himself sung out ‘‘ho” as loud as he
could. Then all the people beat the boards, which were laid down at
the place of meeting, and cried “he.” Next all the ha/mshamtskEs
dancers—all of whom are women—were tied to a rope which was held
by aman. The bear dancers were tied together in the same manner,
and led by another man, one of the old bear dancers. Then the
ha/mshamtsEs began to ery “wip wip” and the bears began to growl.
Now Nu/‘xnémis sang out again, “ho;” the people beat the boards and
responded by the ery “‘hé.” The ha/’mshamtsEs began to ery “ wip,”
the bears began to growl “wo ha,” and the fool dancers cried ‘ wihi’.”
After a short interval, Nu’xnémis sang out “ho” for the third time,
and the people and the dancers responded in the same manner. ‘Then,
while the men were still beating time and while the various cries were
being uttered, Ya’qois, the chief ha’/mats’a, rushed out of the woods,
followed by his six attendants, and erying “hap, hap, hap, hap.” He
ran about among the people in a state of great excitement.

Nu’xnémis spoke: ‘Let me ask you what has happened that Ya‘qeis
should be so much excited?” Ho/LElite replied: ‘** We have not been
in the house of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. But our friend Ya/qois has
passed through it eight times. He knows all that belongs to the win-
ter dance, and he knows all the mistakes that may be made. Ya/qois
has seen that we have no chief t’?0/X’uit among us to throw the super-
natural power among our friends here, and that has made him wild.
Therefore I will call someone who has been t’o’X’uit four times to be
our chief in the AmB/1k".” Then he called a woman, saying: ‘Come,
Wilanqoalag-ilis! Take your place, for you were made t’0/X’uit by your
father four times, so that you are not afraid of anything.” Then he
‘alled all the people to stand in a square, and the woman took her
position in the middle. Upon Ho0/LElité’s command, the men com-
menced to beat the boards. He asked K-éx: to step inside the square,
and to show the woman what to do. He obeyed, and while the people
were beating the boards K-éx: began to dance in a stooping position.
He looked up and down and trembled while he was running backward
and forward with short steps. Finally he turned to the right and

caught the supernatural power of the winter dance between his palms.
Four times he ran backward and forward, swinging his hands, the
palms of which were pressed together, then he threw if upon the peo-
ple, who began to laugh, while some cried “hap” and “ wiht.” Now the
woman was told to try to catch the supernatural power. She went
through the same motions, and when she caught the spirit, the sound
of whistles which she had hidden in her mouth was heard. Tour
times she ran backward and forward, then she threw the supernatural
power among the people, who stooped down at once. Then they began
to laugh and to utter their cries. This continued for a few minutes,
then she caught the spirit again, whereupon Nu‘xnémis sung out “ho”
for the fourth time. The people responded ‘hé.”

Meanwhile the day had broken. The people arranged themselves in
procession, which was led by Ya/qois and his attendants. They were
followed by the bear dancers; then came the fool dancers and the
ha/mshamntsEs, and finally, as a fourth group,.the people surround-
ing the t?o/X’uit who had thrown the supernatural power into them.
Ya/qois first entered the house of Nu’xnémis, followed by the rest of
the procession. Wilanqgoa‘lag:ilis was the last to enter. She was
accompanied by Ho/LElité and Nu’xnemis, who remained standing,
one on each side of the doorway. As soon as she had entered, she
commenced singing her secret song:

1. O friend! T have been made to set everything to rights. O friends! yo, yo, vo,
yei, friend! yo, yo, yo, yéi, friend.
. O friend! I carry in my hands the dances of my rivals. O friends! yo, yo, yo,
yéi, friend! yo, yo, yo, yéi, friend.
3. O friend! They tried to strike me with the death bringer. O friends! yo, yo, yo,
yei, friend! yo, yo, yo, yéi, friend.
4, O friend! And the fire of death has been put into my hands. O friends! yo, yo,
yo, yei, friend! yo, yo, yo, yéi, friend.

fh

She sang this song standing in the doorway, and during this time
G:a/lg-alxola, who was standing among the people, said: ‘I am glad
that you have come, and that you compel us to follow the laws of our
ancestors; but sing louder, that we may know who you are.” ‘Then
he turned to his people and continued: “Take care! Sometimes the
to’ X’uit will come to a house in which there are many people and will
benefit them, but generally they do harm to them.” Then the woman
stopped singing. H06/LElité gave a signal to the people to beat time,
and Nu’xnémis cried “ho,” as before. The people responded ‘ hé,”
but kept on beating the boards. Then the t’o’/X’uit went forward to
the rear of the house, leaving the fire to her left. She moved in a
stooping position, looked up and down, and finally caught the super-
natural power. Then the whistles were heard again. She tirew it
among the people, who first cried ‘‘ ya,” as though she had missed them;
but then they began to utter their various cries. After a few minutes
she took the spirit back again and all were quiet,

YVhen G-a/lg-axola said: “What was the matter just now? I told you
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 585

to take good care and not to yield, and you seemed to have lost your
senses. Take better care the next time.”

Then they walked out of the house in the same order, the t?0/X’uit
with her two attendants being the last. When Nu’/xnémis left the
house, he cried again “ho,” and all the people responded “hé,” but
the ha/mats’a cried ‘hap, hap, hap, hap,” the bears cried ‘wo, ha,” the
fool dancers “ wihi,” and the ha/mshamtsks “wip, wip.” In this man-
ner they visited four houses. In each house the t’o’X’uit caught the
supernatural power and threw it upon the people, as described hereto-
fore. Lvery time she threw it the uproar inereased. The people shook
their blankets to indicate that the power had entered them. They
laughed and cried, and kissed each other’s wives, for during this time
there is no jealousy and no quarreling.

After they had visited four houses, Nu/xnemis led them back to the
winter dancing house of Se’g-ag:ila. They were marching in the same
order as before. Just before they entered, H0/LElité spoke: “ Friends,
I missed one of our number.” The people asked who it was, and he
replied: ‘It is the son of our friend Sé’g-ag-ila. The spirits have taken
him away. Let us go into the house and see what we can do for our
friend.” Then the people entered. As soon as all were in, the whistles
were heard in the ha’mats’a’s room. Then Ho/LElité spoke: “ Enter
this house of our ancestors and observe the rules that were laid down
for the winter ceremonial. Now be happy. I thank you that you all
have come to this morning’s ceremonial, for I do not like to have the
Koskimo or other strangers laugh at us. If any of you should have
gone home before we finished, they might have had cause for doing so.
We have done well, and the spirit of the winter dance is pleased with
our work, else he would not have taken one of our number with him.
Therefore I myself and my friend Nu/xnémis are pleased with you. We
can not do anything without you, for what is the power of a chief
without the help of his tribe? You call me and Nu‘xnémis chiefs of the
winter ceremonial, but we have no power without you. Now I have
finished.” Then Nu’xnémis sang out once more “ho,” the t’0/X’uit
repeated her secret song, and when she had finished HO0/LElité gave the
Signal for the people to beat the boards. She stretched her hands for-
ward and caught the supernatural power in the same manner as de-
scribed before, and threw it upon the people, who cried again. Three
times she caught it and threw it upon the people. The fourth time
after she had caught it she threw it up into the air. Then she sat
down.

Now H0’LElité arose and spoke: ‘O friends! Do you see how I look? I
am almost ready to run away trom this house of the supernatural power.
I was standing near the post and next to me was standing K-éx-’s son.
As soon as our friend Wilanqoa‘lag‘ilis caught the supernatural power
the fourth time and threw it upward, it came and took the son of our
chief K-éx: along. Triends, there was one taken away this morning,
586 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and a second one was taken just now, so there are two of our number
missing to-day. If the supernatural power continues in this manner,
we shall have no children left. Therefore I think I will go home and
hide.” When the people heard this, they cried: “Oh, do not go!
What shall we do without you, the only one who can speak with the
spirit of the winter dance.”

G-a/Ig-axola said: “Indeed, Ho/LElite, your words are true. But
why do you want to run away and leave usin thedark? Your name was
given to our ancestors as a light by which to see the spirit of the win-
ter dance, and you also, Nu/xneémis, were made chief of the winter dance
of the Kue/xa. If you run away, what can we do, for none of us can
speak to the spirits as you two friends do. Take care, and let us stand
our ground, Let us face the spirit of the red cedar bark. Now pass
around the batons and let us sing the songs that our grandfathers
used in order to drive away the birds of the red cedar bark, for I am
afraid of the way in which our people are disappearing to-day. Now
I have finisned.”

Then Nu’xnémis called all the men together, struck the board once,
and cried “wo wo ai.” Then all the people struck the boards together
and cried “ wo wo ai a ai a kas ai,” beating time rapidly for a few min-
utes. Then Nux/némis struck the board with one sharp stroke and
eried “wo.” Then all the people did the same, all striking the boards at
the same time with one short, loud rap. Immediately following this
rap they beat the boards rapidly, crying “he,” drawn out very long.
Then they were quiet, but the whistles continued to be heard.

G:a/lg-axola said: ‘¢ You have failed to drive away the spirits with this
song.” Then Nu/xnémis gave another rap and cried “hama ma ma.”
Then all the people began to strike the boards rapidly, and cried “‘hama
ma ma ma ma,” continuing to beat the boards for a few minutes. This
ery is intended to drive away the grizzly bear. Then Nu’xnémis gave a
short rap, crying at the same time “‘hamam,” and all the people gave a
short rap and cried “hama ma ma,” and then ceased beating. The
whistles were still heard.

Then G-a/lg-axdla said: ‘*You have missed the spirit of the cedar
bark again. Nu/xnémis struck the boards as before and cried
“yvihiiii”” Then the people took up the cry in the same manner as
before, crying “yo hiiiihi att,” and again Nu’/xnémis gave the signal
to stop, as before, by the cry “‘yihi,” and the people finished, crying
“vihbiiiihuun” Still the whistles continued to be heard.

Again G-a’lg-axola said, “ You missed the spirit again, for the whistles
continue to sound. Now try to find a song that will drive them away.”
Now Nu‘xnemis cried ‘‘wup,” as before, and the people repeated “ wup,
wup, wup.” Nu’xnemis gave the signal to stop, as before, crying “‘ wup,”
to which the people responded by erying “kux, wup, wup, wup.” Now
the sounds of the whistles began to grow a little weaker.

Then G-a/lg:axola said: ** Now you have hit the birds of the ceremo-
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 587

nial, for you hear that their cries have changed. Look out, Nu‘/xnemis
and Ho/LElité, and you members of the seal society, and you que/qutsa.”
Then Nu/xnemis gave a new signal and began to sing, accompanied by
all the people, who were beating time very rapidly. The song was ae
follows:

At the end of the song the master of cer- Ga —B8—
emonies cried “hi;”. and when he had fin-
ished, all the people sang

ha he.

This song was repeated four times, and all this while the sound of
the whistles was growing less and less. Finally, at the end of the last
song, the people cried in response to Nu/xnémis’s ery, ‘wo hia/he, wa
wa” and with this the sound of the whistles ceased altogether.

Then G-a/lg-axola said: “Wa, wa! Lean not say much now, for we are
surely all very hungry. But I will thank you for driving away the
birds. Lam afraid of the way in which our children were taken away
this morning. Our friend K-ex: has asked me to invite you, Ya/qois, to
stay and to have something to eat, and all you, members of the seal
society, and you, que’qutsa. Now take your seats.” Then all the people
sat down in their proper places, while Ya‘qois retired to the secret room
of the ha/mats’a in the rear of the house. Then K-ex: and his friends
brought dry salmon and roasted it. They sent a piece to Ya’qois,
and then distributed the rest among the members of the seal society
and the qué/qutsa. They sent a dish of grease to Ya/qois, and then
gave the others in order, one dish to every four persons. After they
had eaten, K-éx: asked them to keep their seats, as he intended to
give another feast. Ho/Lelite, who acted as K-ex’’s speaker, said:
“Now friends, my chief K-éx: is going to give another feast. Let us
sing and let the world know that we are feasting. Pass the batons.
588 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

We have much to do before this night.”. One man distributed the
batons, and now Nu’xnémis began the song of the ha/mats’a Bu/bago-
layu of the Kue'xa, and the latter tribe sang as follows:

1. You are looking for food, great magician, hame.

2. Sweet is what you will eat, great cannibal, hamé.
3. You will swallow men alive, great cannibal, hame.

After the first song was finished, Nu’xnémis began another song of
the same ha‘mats’a, which was also sung by the Kué’xa:
1. BaxbakualanuXsi wae was looking for food for me, hamai.
2. BaxbakualanuXsi’ waé was looking for men for me, hamai.
3. BaxbakualanuXsi wae was looking for corpses for me; therefore you are feared
by all, as you will devour men, hamai.
4. Yes! all are afraid of you, eldest brother! You who empty the houses, great
magician,
After these two songs of the Kue’xa, the song maker of the Walas
Kwakiutl commenced the following song:
1. I want to eat you; Iam a great magician.
2. Your dance is getting greater all the time, you true dancer.
3. Your dance 1s growing greater all the time, you true dancer.

The second song of the Walas Kwakiutl was as follows:

1. He cried hap for me, the great magician, hamamai.

2. He sang the songs of the winter dance for me, the great magician; hamai.

3. I went through BaxbakualanuXsi’ wae’s house, the great magician’s; hamamai.

4. I went to the far end of our world. Iam lhked by all as far as the edge of our
world. All try to imitate me; hamamai.

While the last song was being sung, K-éx: and his friends were prepar-
ing the berries. The dishes were placed in four rows, and two men were
sent around to count the people by threes, while a third one distributed
the spoons. Then K-ex: called H06/LElité to come. He took up a dish
and said: ‘‘ Now friends, we are ready to eat. But I donot want to have
any trouble. I want to keep the weather calm for our great friend
Ya/qois, for if I do not give to him first he will grow as wild as the storm.
This dish is for you, Ya‘qois.”. Then he took up another dish and said:
‘This is for you, seals, and for your friends.” Thus the dishes were all
distributed, one being given to each three persons. Before they began
to eat, a man was sent to Ya/qois, to see if he had commenced eating.
Soon he came back carrying the empty dish and laughing. He said:
“Look at me, friends. Our great friend Ya/qois must have been
hungry, for his dish was emptied before I came to see him. Now eat,
for you must be hungry also.” Then all began to eat.

Ho’LeElite arose, holding his speaker’s staff, and said: “Friends, I
feel happy on account of this day’s work. It seems to me I am seeing
our grandfathers, and that pleases me much; and it must please you
too, La‘ingala; and you, La/LasqEm; and you, NE’/msqEmut; and you,
K-e’qale; and you, Ts’i/lg‘axsta. I know you all feel very happy to-day.
Only do not forget the laws of our grandfathers. But I must not say

that again, for you are keeping them well.” While he was saying so,
some of the old people remarked: “ Yes; it is true.” And he con-
cluded: “I know we are glad to-day. Now eat, for our chief’s food is
sweet.”

Now the people ate, and when they had finished, most of them went
home. The ha/mats’a’s whistles were heard during this time in his
room.

About 2 p.m. the people came to fetch blankets, which were to be
given away in honor of Ya/qois, in payment of his last ecstasy. When
the blankets were being brought into the house, the tally keeper of the
G:o/p’enox came in to look after the proper distribution of the blan-
kets. He gave the names of the clans and the number of blankets which
were to be given to each name in each clan. The blankets were
arranged in such a manner that those intended for each clan were laid
in the same direction, while those of the next clan were placed cross-
wise on top of the preceding lot. Wherever a man was to receive
blankets who still owed some to the giver, a number of sticks corre-
sponding to the number of blankets due were placed in the pile, which
were given to the debtor as canceling the debt, according to the num-
ber of sticks. After the pile intended for the G:0/p’en6x was arranged,
the tally keepers of the other tribes came in and looked after the blan-
kets which were to be given to them. In the evening a feast was given,
the blankets were distributed, and shortly after the beginning of the
feast the ha’mats’a Ya/qois came in and danced three times; the first
and the second time in a squatting position with an ordinary blanket,
but the third and fourth time in a standing position and wearing a
Chileat blanket. As everybody was tired on account of the long cere-
monies of the preceding nights, the feast closed early.

November 25.—Karly in the morning T’0/kuiL, chief of the Koskimo,
sent his two speakers, A’/Labala and WalkaLtsEmt, to the chiefs of the
Kwakiutl, to inform them that on this day the Koskimo intended to
perform their ceremonies, and requesting them to postpone their festi-
vals to another day. They also asked them to keep the matter a secret
from the young men. At the same time the speakers invited the
Koskimo to come quietly to the house of their chief. At 8 o’clock they
were assembled. Then a ha’mats’a was placed at the entrance, in order
to prevent outsiders from coming in, and members of the tribe from leay-
ing the house. A/Labala, the first speaker of the Koskimo, arose and
spoke in a low voice so that he could not be heard outside the house:

_ “Koskimo, you have assembled in the dancing house of our grand-
fathers. Thank you, friends, for having followed the first call of our
chief T’o’/kuit. Listen to me, men, women, and children! You have
the largest cedar bark in the whole world, and you keep the laws of
your grandfathers more strictly than anyone else. We have two chiefs
in our tribe, and therefore we can not be vanquished in our strife with
property. Look out! Do not let the Kwakiutl vanquish you, for they
590 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

are few only. See, how many you are! There are enough Koskimo in
this house to fill the seats all around the walls. The Kwakiutl could
not fill one-half of the seats in this house. Therefore they can not
vanquish us. Take care, friends! As I said before, we have a good
tradition to follow. Therefore we can afford to laugh at them. The
Kwakiutl say that we have no tradition, but our chief T’0’kuiL, who is
going to give the ceremonial, belongs to the family of G-é/xdEn. You
know that he had a ha/mats’a whose name was Nauayolis (the only
one in the middle of the world). Who has a name as great as that?
And if 1 should mention all the traditions and the great names of
our grandfathers, the people would run into the woods, for they have
no names like ours. Therefore, take care, friends! It is not my office
to let you know the plans of our chief. I have said enough.”

All were quiet for about half an hour, Then To’qoamalis, the chief
keeper of the red cedar bark of the Koskimo, arose. He looked up to
the roof and down to the floor, and then said:

““A/Labala, your words are true. You have seen part of my younger
days, for you have seen my father. But you have not seen my grand-
father. I have seen him. His rules were strict, but those of my father
were a little less rigid. Our rules of the winter dance are much less
strict than those of olden times. Thank you, A/Labala, for your speech.
I paid close attention and found that you did not make a single mis-
take. Now, friend A/Labala, look out and take notice of all I say in
the speeches that I make during the winter ceremonial, at marriages,
when the marriage money is refunded, and at summer festivals; for all
these were learned from my great-grandfather. They were given to
my father and to my great-grandfather at the beginning of the world
by the Maker of Dances. Thus I obtained the large box in my house,
in which I keep all the dances and the red cedar bark and the names
and traditions of our great-grandfathers. After I am dead, I want you,
A‘Labala, to take my house and the large box in which I am keeping
the laws of our grandfathers. Next winter we shall have the greatest
winter dance that has ever been known, but I do not want to direct it,
for I will give all my rights to you, friend A/Labala. After this winter
you will have to ask his advice about everything, not mine.

‘¢Now I will speak about our present meeting, for I know you all wish
to know its object. You can not know, for it is the office of the chief
of the winter ceremonial to inform you. You know that lam the chief
of the winter ceremonial. My name is To/qoamalis. It is renowned
among all the tribes all around the world, for I have given blankets to
all of them, and whenever I speak they all hear me. The spirit of the
winter dance even hears me, and you also, my tribe, hear me. This is
a Secret meeting of our winter dance. You are aware that the grand-
son of our chief T’o’kuiL has been taken away by the spirit, and that
0/kuil’s sister was taken away at the same time. Last night Bax-
bakualanuXsi/wae came to me and told me that these two have passed
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 591

through all his customs and rules, and that they are on their way home.
Therefore I have called you into our winter dance house, that you may
prepare for them. They will make their appearance to-day. Keep
yourselves in readiness. The spirit never lies, and BaxbakualanuX-
si/waé does not keep the novices longer than four days, and it is four
days to-day since our children have disappeared. Now I have finished.”

Every now and then the old men would interrupt him, saying: ‘ Your
words are true,” or “Your words are good, chief,” or “Go on! teach
your children how to speak.” He remained standing a short while
without speaking.

Then T’0/kuiL came forth from behind a curtain that was stretched
along the rear of the house, and said: ‘*O Koskimo! I am pleased that
you have come to this house. I did not put it up for myself; I did so
for the greatness of your name. How glad I am, for I believe I heard
our chief T0’/qoamalis say that BaxbakualanuXsi/waé came and told
him that my grandson and my sister are on their way home. Is that
true?” 'To’/qoamalis replied: “It is true.” Then T’0’/kuilL continued:
“Let them come, for I have my property in readiness.” To/qoamalis
said: “I did not finish. Let our leaders prepare to meet the two new
ha/mats’as who are on their way home from Baxbakualanu Xsi/waé,
for they will be excited, and we must not call upon the que’qutsa to
be the first to meet them. We must ask some who have greater powers.
I will ask our friend the great Po’Xuiyalas, and her friend the great
G-a‘loiL, and the great Kokuitala, and the great Q’é’q’anqoala, our
four ma/inaq’as who have passed through the t’6/X’uit ceremonies to be
our leaders. Next shall follow the Hé/meElk, the old ha/mats’as. I
will ask you, Na’/noqois, and you, great Nau/alg-is, and your friend the
great Qoa’ts’amya, and your friend the great Qoa’/yuqoalag-ilis, and
your great friend Qoaxkue’k", and your great friend L’émElxa/‘lag‘ilis,
to follow the ma/maq’as to defend us from the wildness of the new
ha/mats’as. Next I will ask you, Maa/myaank"; you will form the third
group. Dress yourselves as nicely as you can. You have heard the
Kwakiutl say that we do not know how to arrange a winter ceremonial
properly. Send someone to fetch button blankets from your houses
and put them on. Last of all, I] will ask you, queée’qutsa. Two of you
shall carry a plank on which the Maa/myaank" shall beat time to
accompany their song. ‘Two others shall carry a plank on which the
ma/maq’as shall beat time to accompany their song, and you shall also
earry a plank on which you shall beat time to accompany your own
song. And oneof you shall carry a skindrum. Our friends the great
ha‘/mats’as shall not sing, because they have to look after their whistles.
There shall be four attendants for each of the new ha/mats’as, and I[
will name them now. You, Hé/lek-ats’e, K-a/qoneé, ALanudala, and
your friend Hé‘lekamig:alis, keep ready to attend the new ha/mats’a,
who is going to come back to us to-day. You, Qoa/gis, Nalulala,
X‘i/x-éqala, and your friend, Lela/asnuk", keep ready to attend the
592 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

other ha/mats’a, who is going to come back to us to-day. That is all.
These are the rules of G-é/xdin, who came down from heaven. My
grandfather was of the blood of G-e/xdEn, according to the tradition.
Be very careful, for the Kwakiutl tribes will watch us closely. They
will try to find fault with our laws, for they have ways of their own
which differ widely from ours. They have no winter ceremonial of
their own, and they will try to learn from us. Iam not ashamed to show
our winter ceremonial, for it is derived from tradition. That is all.”

With this he sat down and A’Labala arose. He said: ““O Koskimo!
you have heard the rules of our grandfathers. Try to remember them,
and do not forget what our chief has said, for he might die and I
might die as well, and then one of you must take my place. That is
all, my grandchildren.”

Next La/eulag-ilis, the chief of the painting, arose and said: To’qoa-
malis, it is true what you said. We have traditions which teach us
our laws. Weare not like our rivals, the Kwakiutl. I tried to dis-
cover the origin of their names which they use in the winter ceremo-
nial, but no one could tell me, for they have no traditions. Therefore
you, Koskimo, my tribe, may laugh at the little Kwakiutl; fer each of
our clans has a tradition, or even two, and we may justly be proud
of it. Look at meand myname. According to the tradition that was
told me by my grandfather, the first La’gulag-ilis was the chief of the
paintings for the winter ceremonial. That is now my name. It
belongs to the tradition of my clan, the G-e’xsEm. And my name has
existed from the beginning of the world. When the Kwakiutl desire
to discover the true history of our ceremonials, tell them the tradition
of G-e/xdEn, for our chief, T’o’/kuiL, is giving his winter ceremonial.
Now take care, my tribe. You are aware that I am the chief of the
paintings and of the ornaments of the que’qutsa. We are all pre-
pared now, for we are painted with charcoal that we obtained from
Ya/xstaL, according to the legend of the Naq0d/mg-ilisala. You know
how he obtained the fire of death from the wolves at yayaiL. You
also remember how he burnt his enemies to ashes and transformed
them into stone by means of his fire of death. Our paint is that of
Ya/xstaL, therefore we use only black paint and no red paint. The
other tribes use very little charcoal and much red paint, because they
have no traditions to guide them. I do not allow any red paint to be
used in the winter ceremonial, because our traditions do not say any-
thing about the use of red paint. Only the clan NakE/nsx:a are allowed
to use red paint, for their chief, Néna/laats’éqa, used red paint in the
dance no/nLEm, to indicate the blood of the tribes whom he had
killed. ‘Therefore they use no charcoal, but red paint only. They
also use white paint in the no‘nLEm dance, because Néna/laats’eqa
brought this ceremonial down from heaven, and the white paint sym-
bolizes the white clouds. All our ceremonials are founded on tradi-
tions which our ancestors were careful to preserve. Now I have
finished my speech.” (See p. 410 and figs, 129-133, pp. 484-486.)
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 593

Then G-a/sa arose and said: “ Did you hear the speech of our old
chief? I made me feel proud and happy, for [am a young man and
did not know how we obtained our winter ceremonial. Let us remem-
ber the speeches and traditions of our ancestors. Take care, ma/maq’as,
ha/mats’as, maa/myaank", and you, qué/qutsa of the Koskimo, Gua’ts’e-
nox and L’a‘/sq’énox, for we are all one tribe now. Do not fall and do
not laugh, that the Kwakiutl may not sneer at us. I am going to watch
you carefully, and if I should see anyone breaking the laws of the win-
ter ceremonial, he will be made a wa‘tanEm. He will have to wear a
long white feather and dance in all the houses of the Kwakiutl. After
his dance he will have to distribute at least one hundred blankets. This
will be the punishment for any transgression of the rules of our
ancestors.”

When he had finished, two men, Na’kuaLeé and Walx:aLtsamt, entered,
and the latter spoke: ‘‘ Be quiet, slaves of the red cedar bark! I have
seen our two chiefs who were taken away by G:e/xdEn’s Baxbakualan-
uXsi/wae. They look dreadful, dressed in ornaments of balsam pine.
I narrowly escaped them.” G-a‘sa asked, “Is that true?” When he
said so, a man who was standing on the roof of the house secretly gave
a signal to the two new ha/mats’as, who were waiting in the woods at
the west end of the village. They rushed down to the beach, crying
“hap, hap.” When the people who were assembled in the house heard
them, To’qoamalis sent G-a/sa to the roof of the house to look around.
He came back and said: “Slaves of the red cedar bark, prepare to meet
our two new ha‘mats’as.”

Then the people left the house, the four ma/maq’as first. They were
followed by the six ha’mats’as, who wore ornaments of red cedar bark
and eagle down on their heads. Cedar bark was wound in four turns
around their arms and legs. Next followed the maa/myaank", tie
young women, who also wore rings of red cedar bark, but no arm rings
or leg rings. They had a belt of cedar bark and wore button blan-
kets. Their faces were painted black. with three horizontal lines (one
over the eyebrows, one over the lower part of the nose, and one just
under the mouth) and four vertical lines (one downward from the mid-
dle of each lower eyelid, and one from the middle of each temple). When
these three groups had left the house, the remaining qte‘qutsa shouted
“yu” four times. Then they all rushed out of the house, and followed,
in a separate group, the three preceding groups. The ma/maq’as were
singing. The ha/mats’as walked on silently. Their heads and arms
were held downward. The maa’myaank" were singing and dancing,
and the que/qutsa cried “yu” every few minutes.

When they had reached the new ha/mats’as, the four ma’/maq’as sur-
rounded them. The six old ha/mats’as formed a circle around the
ma/maq’as. They in turn were surrounded by the maa/myaank", who
held each other’s hands. The que/qutsa surrounded the last in a half
circle, also holding each other’s hands. Only the four speakers, Ma/a,

G-a/La, A/Labala, and Lo/Xoaxstaak", remained standing outside the
circle. The last named shouted from time to time ‘‘we/i, we/1,” stretch-
ing his left hand upward, while with his right hand he heid the speaker’s
staff. The people responded by the ery “yu.”

Then Ma/a spoke: ‘Friends, we have caught the grandson and the
sister of our chief, who were taken away by BaxbakualanuXsi'wae.
We thought they might be dead and they might never return. What
in the whole world can vanquish us? Even Baxbakualanu Xsi/waé is
tmable to overcome us. I thought the Kwakintl might have killed
these two young people, because they can not overcome us in our war
of property. Jam glad that they were taken away by the spirit of the
winter ceremonial. Weare a long way from our village, and I believed
that the spirit of the winter ceremonial had stayed behind, but he is fol-
lowing us wherever we go. Now let us return to the woods and learn
the song of our novices. BaxbakualanuXsi/wae gives four songs to all
the novices who go to his house, and certainly he has given songs to
these two.”

The two novices now ran back to the woods, erying “hap,” and the
peopleran with them. Here they sat down. G-a/loiL and Qoaqoax:st’ala
took their seats in the middle of the whole group. Then Ma’a said:
‘¢ Now listen, Koskimo! I will ask our singing masters to sing four new
songs for these ha/mats’as. Try to learn them as quickly as you can.
Sing! singing masters; and put some words against the Kwakiutl into
your songs, G:a/loiL.” The first singing master of the tribe commenced
his song, and after he had sung one line, he began to beat time. The
people joined him, and after he had sung through the whole song, they
tried to sing it. Next Qoaqoax:st’ala sung his song in the same man-
ner. Then G-a'loiL sang the third song, and finally Qoaqoax:st’ala the
last one. The two singing masters asked the people if they liked the
songs, and T’0 kuil thanked them, saying that they were just what he
had wished for. Then the people arose, and started to return to the
village in the order indicated in fig. 188.

3efore starting they all put on head rings and neck rings made of
hemlock branches. As soon as they reached the village, LO’Xoaxstaak"
shouted “wei, wéi,” and all the que’qutsa responded “yi.” Then the
ha/‘mats’as began to run about and to dance in the circle, and the people
struck up the new songs, beating time on boards that were carried by
some of the qué/qutsa. The maa/myaank" also began to dance, and
thus they proceeded until they reached the dancing house (Plate 45).
The novices were the last to enter the house. There they danced
around the fire. The maa/myaank" danced in their honor, and the old
ha’‘mats’as joined their dance. After the second dance they were
clothed by Ma/a, and then they began to dance more quietly. After
the fourth dance they disappeared into their secret room.

Now the Koskimo, Na‘q’oaqt6q, and the Kwakiutl assembled on the
beach and sat down in a square. A grandson of Wa’las, the Koskimo,

was going to buy a copper. A number of speeches were made, and a
woman danced for Wa‘las, for whom the people sang a song of joy.
During the feast that followed this purchase, the ha/mats’as of the
Koskimo sat on a platform with blackened faces, behind the que/qutsa.
(Plate 46).

The members of the seal society of the Kwakiutl were still confined
to the dancing house, but every now and then they rushed out of if and
knocked the people down. The ha/mats’as hit them, and they broke
canoes, dishes, and other things.

In the evening the Koskimo had their t’E’/msEla. When the four
messengers were sent out to invite the people, the host blew four times
upon them, and their head rings were strewn with down. At this time
the ha/mats’a rushed out of his secret room, ran around the fire, and
out of the door. As soon as he appeared, all the people who hap-
pened to be in the house took up sticks, or whatever they could lay
their hands on, and beat time rapidly. In the evening the people
assembled. The Kwakiutl and Na/q’oaqtoq took up the front corners.

THE RETURN OF THE NOVICE.
Order of procession: (@) The novices; (») the old ha/mats’as; (c) the ma/maq’as; (d) the speakers;
(m) the maa/myaank"; (q) the quée’qutsa; (s) the singing masters.

When all were assembled, the speakers of the Koskimo came in,
their faces blackened. They were followed by a man carrying a ring
to which many small horns were attached. As soon as they entered,
the people beat time and sang while they were going to the rear of
the house. Then the man who carried the ring went to the rear of the
house singing and beating time for himself. Another person, who
held two lances wound with cedar bark, made a speech, which was fol-
lowed by another song of the man wearing the head ring. After this
the speaker took off the head ring and explained the meaning of the
horns. He said: ‘These seven horus have been put on to the ring by
BaxbakualanuXsi’wae. They belong to the ring of No/aqala, the
ha‘mats’a. He obtained it from G-é/xdEn. He had two neck rings
which were held by the k-i/nqalaLala of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. The
white rings which are fastened to his hemlock rings are the stars and
the one in front is the sun. The red lines on his cheek are the blood

which flowed down where BaxbakualanuXsi’/wae rubbed G:e’xdEn.
White cedar bark is flowing down from the rear part of his ring.”

Now people were heard singing outside, but before they entered some
blankets were distributed. Three or four speakers who carried lances
stepped into the doorway. Then a dancer entered singing; his whole
face was blackened. The speaker closed his mouth with his hands,
compelling him to stop singing, and spoke to him. The dancer replied:
‘Nothing is heard.” The speaker left him. He continued his song.
Then he danced forward and raised his hands alternately. His song
was not accompanied by any beating of time. His head ring hada
horn in front. During this time the speakers were talking. Finally
the dancer was taken to the rear of the fire by the speaker who held
the lance. Now the singers began to sing again. QeE‘IdétsEm and
another old man performed a dance, and blankets were given away.
Some blankets were held around the fire while the distribution was
going on. During this time the speaker who carried the lances went
to the door and four womer went out.

Now the speaker ordered the people to sing, and a ha‘mats’a, accom-
panied by one assistant, entered. The beating of time continued for
some time before the singing began. When the ha’mats’a had reached
the rear of the house, seven women entered dancing. One of them
remained standing near the door, while the others danced around the
fire. In the dances of the Koskimo, one woman, whose duty it is to
sing all the secret songs, remains standing in the doorway during the
whole ceremony. At the end of the second dance of the ha/mats’a
some of the women danced out of the house again. After his first
circuit the ha/mats’a danced once to the right and once to the left, in
the rear of the house, and disappeared behind the curtain.

Now blankets were again distributed in honor of the preceding
dance. Again the women were heard singing outside. They entered,
dressed in blankets, and imitating the motions of birds, and thus they
danced to the rear of the house, where they remained standing. They
were followed by the speaker, who carried the lance. One of them sang,
while the others danced in the rear of the house. Then blankets were
distributed among the Na/q’oaqtoq. Next a speaker whose face was
blackened went out.

Then the ma/maq’a entered, wearing a blanket. Men and women
were talking to him. He put his hands on a baby that was sitting
in the lap of its mother, and blew on it. Then he spoke in front of
the curtain, and the people replied “wo.” Next Qu/ldetsEm appeared
from behind the curtain, dancing. He was followed by the speaker
carrying a lance and a man who carried his child on his arms. The
child wore a ha/mats’a head mask. After they had gone around the
fire once, the singers began their song and the women danced. Some —
speeches followed.

Now the arrival of new dancers was announced. <A ha/mats’a entered

with his assistants. The people sang for him. After he had danced
around the fire once in a squatting position, he danced a second cireuit
standing. He wore a short blanket and dancing apron, a thin round
neck ring, and a flat head ring with small white rings on the front and
sides. During his dance he squatted down every now and then and
danced a few steps in long leaps. Finally he disappeared behind the
eurtain. His mother remained standing in the doorway and danced for
him. Again the speaker delivered a speech and began to distribute
blankets. By this time it was half past eleven.

The women had become hungry, and were eating in the rear of the
house, and uttering the calls of their societies every now and then.

A new dancer was announced. The singers began to beat time, and
a woman, a t’o’X’uit, entered dancing, her palms stretched forward
and upward. <A second woman, and two men who carried guns and
blankets, followed her. She was painted black in the following man-
ner: Her right cheek was all black, while on the left cheek two vertical
lines extended down the whole face near the nose. Two horizontal
lines ran from the lips to the ear, one a little above, the other a little
below, the mouth. A long conversation developed between herself
and the speaker. The people beat time twice. They divided into
two parties and discussed how they would try her. One party went
to the door and fetched weapons, saying that they would kill her,
to see if her guardian spirit would protect her. Others said they
would much rather split her. Then the mother-in-law of the t’0/X’uit
stepped between the two parties and asked them rather to kill her;
but when she was beginning to strip off her blanket and shirt they ridi-
cued her, asking if she was not ashamed to strip in front of so many
people, and led her away. The young woman spoke again. Then the
men went out. The speakers who held their lances talked, and after a
short time the three men returned. Some men holding paddles and
staffs were standing in the front row in the rear of the house. Then a
woman and a girl ran out of the door and great excitement prevailed
among the people in the rear of the house. One man cried: ‘+I am
the si/siuL.” Now the t’?o’/X’uit took off her blanket and shirt and sat
down. Then they led a girl around the fire to the rear of the house.
The girl carried a knife. During this time one of the Koskimo women
was singing. Now the speaker, whose face was blackened, took a
paddle out of the hands of one of the men. The woman sat down in
the rear of the fire,in front of the singers. He stepped up to her
while the other woman was dancing, her hands raised and trembling.
Four times the man went around the woman. Every time he stood
behind her he raised his paddle as though he was going to strike her.
The fourth time he really struck her and the paddle entered deeply
into her shoulder and blood was seen to flow down. Now grease was
poured into the fire, so that the house was lit up, and the woman arose
and turned slowly, that everybody might see the paddle sticking in ber
598 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

shoulder. The singers were beating time, and she sat down again.
The paddle was pulled out, apparently with great difficulty. The
shamans stepped up to her and cried “hoi, hoi, hoifff,” and blew upon
her. Now the people began a song, during which the shamans con-
tinued to sing over her. QrE‘IdétsEm also put his hands on her head
and chest and shoulders, erying “hoi, hoi, hoifff.’” While this was
going on, Some of the women arose from their places and danced. —
Then the two shamans who had been working over her, raised her to
her feet, and led her around the fire. The blood had ceased to flow,
but a deep cut, beginning at the right breast and going across her
shoulder far down the back, was clearly visible. Then all the people
eried “hu,” and she went out. Nowa Na/q’oaqt6q spoke, and blankets
were distributed.

At 12.30 a new dance began. The girl who in the preceding dance
had earried a knife came from behind the curtain and danced. <A
number of women danced in her honor, and the same old woman who
had stayed in the doorway continued dancing there. One old woman
was dancing, holding her pipe in her mouth. A song was sung, and
then one of the Koskimo delivered another speech, holding a short staff
in his hands. Whenever a name was called, he raised the staff high
and held it so that the ends rested against his palms.

As the people became hungry by this time, a woman threw dried
salmon among the people, first to the members of the secret society of
the Koskimo, then to the others. When they were eating, the societies
again uttered their calls.

Now a new dance was announced. A woman entered, wearing a flat
ring, the front of which was set with feathers. She carried a bundle of
red cedar bark in her hands. Her eyes and cheeks were painted black.
When she was shaking the bundle of bark, it gave arattling noise. ‘The
people gave her a pipe, a stick, and other things, and whatever she
carried gave a rattling noise. The people took it from her again, but
were unable to produce the same sound. Then they beat time again.
She went once around the fire, looking upward and shaking her bundle
of bark, and holding it as though she was going to throw it. Then she
stood in the rear of the fire and sang her song. She gave her cedar bark
toone of the messengers and took a staff in its place, which she carried
around the fire and made it rattle; another person tried it, but it did
not give asound. Next she took a pipe of one of the Na‘q’oaqtoq and
made it rattle in the same manner. Then she disappeared behind the
curtain.' After some speeches, four young men went out, and several
old people followed them, bringing food.

Then members of the Wa‘tanEm danced. After their dance more
blankets were distributed. While the people were still eating, whistles
imitating the raven’s cry were heard outside. This was about 1.30a.m.
The speaker asked the people to beat time. Then the ha/mats’a entered

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 599

with four assistants, who, however, had norattles. Two women danced
in his honor, During the second song a great many women were
dancing for him. Two bloody lines were painted on each cheek, run-
ning in a wide circle downward from the corners of the mouth to the
eyebrows. He came in, in a great state of excitement, and attacked
his assistants, who were in front of him. After three songs he was led
out of the house. This dance ended at 2 o’clock, and more blankets
were distributed.

A new dance was announced, and a ha/mats’a eutered, his face
painted all black. A hemlock branch was fastened in front of his
head ring. The front of his blanket was adorned with small white
rings. QE/‘IdétsEm pointed out the blanket and said that it was the
blanket of G-é’xdEn. He danced four times. At his third dance he
wore a blanket which showed the si’siuL around its border, In the
middle of the back was painted a squatting man whose palms were
represented by carved wooden skulls which were sewed onto the blan-
ket. The knees and the head were represented in the same way. One
carved skull was also sewed onto the blanket on each side, outside the
figures. He also wore a carved skull in front and one in the back of his
cedar bark head ring. When he came in, five old ha/mats’as danced for
him, while three stood in the door in order to prevent people from going
out. Six songs were sung for him. During the first and second songs
one woinan was dancing for him, After his dances he was led out of
the house. The speaker addressed the people, who beat time and said
“hu.”

Now the sound of whistles and the cries of a ha’mats’a were heard
outside. The same ha/mats’a reentered, and danced one cireuit and a
half around the fire, while the women were dancing in his honor. His
k-i/nqalaLala danced in front of him. When they stopped in the rear
of the house, both squatted down, and their attendants stood around
them. After the fourth dance they disappeared behind the curtain.
Then more blankets were distributed.

At 3.15 women were heard singing outside. A man entered singing,
followed by a woman. Two pairs of bloody lines were drawn on her
cheeks, running downward in a wide circle from the mouth to the ear.
She sang her secret song. She danced as t’0/X’uit, trying to catch her
supernatural power. As soon as she moved her hands upward, trying
to catch it, the women began to dance in her honor. Now she caught
it between her hands and threw it forward. At once a flying si/siuL
Was seen in the rear of the house, moving rapidly to the right and to
the left and trembling all the time. As soon as the si’siuL disappeared
again, all the dancing women put their palms together as though they
had caught the supernatural power. Then blankets were distributed.

At 4 o’clock a woman came from behind the curtain, singing. She
was followed by a ghost dancer, who had a large thick ring of cedar
bark with an enormous horn in front, set with feathers, which were
600 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

waving to and fro on long shafts. It had a long trail behind. The
speaker followed her. The people sang and women danced in her honor.
She disappeared behind the curtain, and blankets were distributed
again.

Now a song was heard outside. The speaker asked the singers to
beat time. A man entered singing. His body was naked, but he wore
a dancing apron and had cedar bark rings around his arms and wrists.
He was a Ba’/bakuauLa, at’o’X’uit. After some speeches there was sing-
ing, and a woman and a man danced. They held their elbows close to
their sides, stretched their hands forward, the palms upward, and moved
the hands up and down in jerky motions. The Ba/bakuauLa was then
placed on a seat behind the fire in front of the singers and the speaker
was asked to pierce him with his lance. The singers beat time, the
speaker took up the lance and threw its point against the floor, to show
that the lance was solid, and showed it around among the people. Then
he took up the lance and walked around the Ba/bakuatLa. After
each circuit he put the point against the left side of Ba’/bakuatiLa, and
then continued his circuit. After he had gone around him four times,
he once more put the lance against his left side and began to push it
in. Apparently the point entered the body, blood was streaming out
of his side, and as the point penetrated farther the Ba/bakuatLa appar-
ently collapsed. Finally the whole length of the lance had pierced the
body and the point was seen to come out on the right side a little below
the arm pit.! He was raised so that the people could see his body.
Then the lance was pulled out again slowly. The shamans were called,
and blew and sang over his body, while the singers continued their
song. Then he was. led behind the curtain. After this, cloths were
distributed among the women; the singers beat time and cried “hua.”

This was the last dance of the night. The Koskimo did not allow
their guests to go home, but invited them to stay for a feast. The
ha/mats’a still remained sitting in front of the door, preventing anyone
from going out. They continued to eat and to make speeches until 10
o'clock, when everybody went home to take a rest.

On the 26th of November everything was quiet, as the people were
exhausted by the preceding festivals.

In the afternoon of the 27th, the Kwakiuti held a secret meeting in
order to determine what to do. The seal society was still confined to
the dancing house. K-ex:, whose mask had broken a few days ago
during the dance, was going to initiate his son in atonement for this
mishap. His elder son had died a few years before, after he had been
made a member of the ha/mats’a society. Referring to this, he spoke

'The Ba‘bakuatLa had a small hook attached to his right arm ring by means of
which he pulled up the skin of his chest below the right arm pit, piercing at the
same time a small bag filled with blood which was fastened to the skin, so that the
blood was seen flowing down his side. This scene seems to be the same as that of
the dance deseribed on p. 575.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 601

in the secret meeting about as follows: “Kwakiutl, give my son long
life! Once I tried to make my son a ha/mats’a, but the deadly Bax-
bakualanuXsi/wae struck him and he died. When he died, I resolved
not to make another child ha/mats’a, but now since the mask broke you
all request me to initiate my younger son. I shail do so, but do give
him long life.” At this point Si/wite, an old blind man, interrupted
him, saying: ‘*‘ Don’t be overbearing and don’t let him have more than
two songs,” meaning that if he gave him four songs the boy should die.
Then all the people scolded and blamed him on account of his merciless
words. Now it was arranged what dances were to be shown and who
was to pay for them. In the evening of this day, K-€x’’s wife disap-
peared all of a sudden. Her clothing was found on the beach, and it
was announced that she was to return as q’0/minoqa on the following
day. In the evening the Kwakiutl held their k-ik-iInala in order
to bring back their novices. I will give only a brief description of
their festival, as the details resemble that of the Koskimo. In the
beginning the societies came in one after the other—first the killer
whales, then the birds, etc. One man came in alone carrying a staff as
though he was shooting with it, and crying “hu.” The people sang
when he came in. Then they tore blankets and distributed the strips.
About 11 o'clock in the evening IK-ex: appeared carrying several spread
tongs, while others followed him carrying staffs which they held
stretched forward. They wore plain head rings. The spread tongs were
given away. They designated gifts of canoes. At this time La/g-us
delivered a speech. Now all had assembled except the members of the
seal society. They came in last and stepped to the rear of the house,
while Ho’/LEIlté made a speech.

Now began the dances. The fool dancers were heard outside, and
they entered wearing masks and enormous noses. One of them had
his face painted black and red. The people sang and the women
danced. After this dance Hii/misilak" gave away a gun and blanket.
A nan carrying a rattle was stationed in the doorway, and announced
with his rattle the arrival of every new dancer. After every dance,
blankets were distributed or other presents were made, but I shall not
describe this every time. The distribution of blankets occupied by far
the greater portion of the night.

The next dancer was an old woman, bent by age, who came in. Her
face was painted red and black.

After a speech, made by La’g-us, a bear dancer came in. His face
was all black. He wore an enormous head ring. Two men followed
him and carried the blankets which were given away after his dance.
As soon as these blankets were distributed, a young bear dancer
appeared from the corner of the house and scratched the ground while
the people were singing and women were dancing for him. Then he
disappeared again.

About midnight a new fool dancer entered, led by a blanket which
602 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

was tied around his waist, and the people sang. After his circuit he
disappeared behind the curtain. Hii/masaqa delivered a speech for him.
He said: ‘The time of fighting has passed. The fool dancer repre-
sents the warriors, but we do not fight now with weapons; we fight with
property.” These words referred to the fact that the man whose place
this dancer had taken had killed a chief of the Nanai‘mo and many
others. Then Hii/masaqa turned to the Koskimo and said: “It is not
right that in your kik-iInala you distributed many blankets. It is
not customary to do so, but now I will show you what we can do.”!

Next a bear dancer entered, wearing a copper around his neck. He
was followed by two men who carried blankets. Women danced for
him. Now E/wanuXts’é took the copper and spoke. He gave it to the
Na/q’oaqt6q. This copper had been given by a Na/q’oaqtoq to his Kwa-
kiutl wife. Now the Na’/q’oaqt6q had to redeem it by a payment of 700
blankets. In his speech E/wanuXts’é held it by its lower end, thus
indicating that he was going to take not more than half the price of
the copper as payment in full. After this La’g-us, who was now stand-
ing in the doorway, delivered a speech. He said: ‘* What is the matter
with our house? It is shaking.”?

Next another bear entered. Ho was caught by K:ex: and led to the
rear of the house while the people were singing. After a speech made
by Hii/masaqa, another bear dancer entered, followed by a woman who
earried a copper. Her mother danced, and during her dance a fool
dancer was heard outside. La/g:us spoke, holding the copper. Then
he gave it to HO/LELité, who replied. K-éex: handed a number of bun-
dles of sticks to Ho/LElité, who spoke about them and distributed them.
Then he returned the copper to La’g-us, who took it to a fool dancer.

About 1 o’ciock another fool dancer entered, who was brought to the
rear of the house by K-éex:.

By this time a man carrying his baby appeared as fool dancer, coming
from the rear corner of the house.

Next another fool dancer entered, and then a bear, who was led by a
blanket which was tied around his waist. The man who led him wore
a large neck ring of hemlock branches, which represented a copper that
was to be given away for the bear dancer. A speech was made, and
the ring was thrown into the fire.

At this moment the whistles of the ha/mats’a were heard. All of a
sudden Ya’qois became excited and jumped down from his seat. His
assistants and two k:i/nqalaLala rushed after him, and after he had
danced around the fire once they all went out of the house. é

At 2 a,m. another fool dancer wearing a large nose entered. After
one circuit he ran out and came back without a mask while the people
were singing.

Next a boy who was to be a pa/xala dancer was brought forward

from the rear of the house. The man who carried him turned once in
the rear of the house, and once in front. The boy was said to see some-
thing supernatural coming, and was carried out of the house.

After blankets were distributed the ha/mats’a reentered, the k-i/n-
qalaLala dancing before him.

Next a bear dancer entered, dressed in a complete bear skin, to which
a mask was attached. The women danced for him, holding their hands
close to the body, not raised, as is usually the case. After one circuit
the bear left the house again.

About 3.30 a.m. two women entered, the first wearing a wide ring
of cedar bark. The following dancer was a ha/mshamtsEs, who danced
with short, quick steps without moving her body. She worea head ring
set with ermine, and a button blanket ornamented with a thunder bird
and a killer whale. She had two heavy black lines running down her
face, and two horizontal ones crossing them. She left the house after
one circuit.

The next dancer was a girl, who was ushered in by her father. The
people were singing and the girl’s mother stepped up to her, encour-
aging her to dance, but as she could not induce the child to do so,
she danced herself, wearing a red blanket. Now Hii’masaqa made a
speech.

About 5 oclock in the morning two ha/mshamtsEs entered. They
were followed by the ha/mats’a, accompanied by four assistants.

The next dancer was hai/alik-ilan. She cried “sh, hoip, hoip.”
She wore a large ring of red cedar bark having four vertical horns, which
extended downward in long tassels of bark. She had a large round
neck ring. Her blanket was set with tassels made of red and white
bark. Attached to the back part of her rings was a tie looking like a
cross. The two messengers who stood at the door led her around the
fire once. Then she went out again. After a short time she reentered.

At 5.15 a.m. a ha/mshamtsEs, wearing a round neck ring set with
four tassels, danced. The two messengers led her around the fire, then
she went out again. They returned and spoke to Ho/Lelite. After
this the people beat time and the dancers disappeared.

At 5.30 a new dancer appeared, wearing hemlock branches around
his head and neck. He danced with short, quick steps, and was led by
the two messengers to the rear of the house. He wore a blue blanket
and a dancing apron set with shells. He was the pa/xalalat., He
danced in the rear of the house without moving from his place; his
whole body was shaking. Two songs were sung for him and the women
danced. After a speech made by Ho/LElité he left the house again.

The next dancer was a T's’0/ndqoa, who entered dressed in a bearskin,
which was attached to her mask. She rubbed her eyes and shouted
‘ou, ou.” Then the people sang, and she went out again.

A new song which was heard at the door, was taken up by the
604 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

singers in the rear of the house. <A t’o/X’uit woman, wearing a head ring
of hemlock branches, but no neck ring, appeared. She held her elbows
to her sides, and her hands forward, palms upward. She raised them
and lowered them alternately. The song was ina three-part rhythm, and
she walked limping, one step being on the quarter mora of the rhythm,
the second step on the half mora of the rhythm, while she was singing
her secret song. After each line of her song the chorus continued it.
She sang: “Ya, ya, ye.”

Now Ho/uelité stepped up to her and spoke. She replied with the
exclamation ‘‘up, up,” pointing to her chest, meaning that the people
should split her. Then she moved her hands in the same way along her
neck, meaning that they should cut off her head. H0/LElité proposed
to throw her into the fire, but after some talk this idea was abandoned.
The people beat time again. She began to dance, and caught her super-
natural power between her palms. Aiter she had done so twice, she
said again “up,up,” touching her stomach with her palms several
times, meaning ‘“‘take out my intestines.” Then she tried again to catch
her supernatural power, and during this time H0/LElité walked around
her, shouting ‘‘up.” Now she tried the fourth time to catch her super-
natural power. At once whistles were heard. A bird was seen flying
down from the roof, and a no/nLEmg-ila figure arose from underground.
The fourth time a feather, which represents the horn of the si’siuL,
came up from underground and moved trembling along the rear of the
house. She went up to it, and all of a sudden she began to disappear
in the ground. One man took hold of her, trying to rescue her, but
his hands and forearms disappeared in the ground down to his elbows.
Several men took hold of him in order to rescue him. Then he was
apparently dragged through the whole house by the t’0/X’uit, who
had disappeared underground. He passed by circuitous movements
through the whole house, plowing up the ground. Finally he seemed
to lose the woman, and fell backward.!

After the t’?6/X’uit had disappeared in the ground, a second one
commenced to dance. The underground motions of the first were led
by the dancing woman, who, with the movements of her hands, tried
to bring her up again. This second t70/X’uit was followed by one man.
Finally she left the house, and blankets were distributed while Ho’LE-
lite delivered a speech. Now a song was heard on the beach outside

This performance had been prepared during the preceding days, when the mem-
bers of the seal society kept everybody away from the house. A deep ditch had been
dug in the rear of the house, in which the t’o’X’uit disappeared. A shallow ditch had
been dug all through the house. <A heavy rope had been placed in this ditch, which
was filled with loose dirt. The man who seemed to hold the t’o’/X’uit pulled himself
along this rope. Unfortunately the rope had been laid too near the fireplace and
was burnt. Thus it happened that the man had to let go. The original plan was to
pursue the t’0’X’uit to the front right corner of the house, where she was to appear
again from out of another ditch which was connected with the ditch in the rear of
the house where she had disappeared.

the house. A messenger ran around the fire, went out of the house,
and returned.

Next La’g-us entered, holding a broken copper in his teeth. He was
followed by a girl. Then one man entered who wore a neck ring. He
had two companions who carried rattles. Another man carrying a
copper plate, and two more men, followed. The people sang a ha/mats’a
song. The girl wore a head ring with ermine trimmings and large
abalone shells. She moved her hands like a ha/mats’a. She was clad
in a button blanket with ermine trimmings. Now La/g-us broke off a
piece of the copper and.threw blankets into the fire. All this time her
mother carried the rattle. The girl went out again.

Next Ho/LElite took a rattle, turned, and went around the fire twice.

Then he listened to see if the new ha/mats’a was coming back. He
listened three times. Now whistles were heard, and the noise of a man
running round the roof of the house. Suddenly the roof boards were
pushed aside. A boy jumped down with a head ring of hemlock and
quartz crystals attached along the median line of his head. He had an
apron of hemlock branches. He jumped first upon the roof of the bed.
rooms in the rear of the house, and from there down to the floor. He
danced, his hands close to the rear side of his thighs, running with short
quick steps and bending rhythmically. Then he ran out. He was the
Ma‘tem. As soon as he left the house the ha/mats’a eried “hap.”
Nu’xnemis then made a speech. The whistles of the ha/mats’a were
Leard in the door, where the k-inqalaLala appeared singing. The
assistants surrounded the ha/mats’a and ran with him around the fire.
Then they went out. Now blankets were carried into the house, and
the new ha/mats’a appeared naked, and danced. His ki/nqalaLala were
singing and dancing before him. This ended the festival.
_ December 5.—The Kwakiutl gave the dance Walas’axa’. The people
assembled in the evening in the dancing house of the Kwakiutl. A
curtain was drawn right across the rear of the house, behind which
the members of the seal society first disappeared. After one of the
Koskimo had given away some blankets, a fool dancer came out at
the rear right-hand corner of the curtain and danced around the fire.
A few women danced for him. Then he disappeared again behind the
curtain. E/wanuXts’é and his speaker remained standing during this
dance and the following ones, facing the curtain in front of which the
singers were sitting. The next dancer was a bear, who also appeared
from behind the curtain. Then the people sang and an old woman
danced for him.

After some blankets had been distributed, a ha/mshamtskEs song
was struck up, and a woman, accompanied by two assistants, appeared
from behind the curtain. She wore the ha/mshamtsEs head ring and
neck ring. The same old woman who had danced before and several
others danced tor her. Her movements were similar to those of the
ha‘mats’a, but she did not tremble. During the first line of the song
606 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

she raised her hands and danced in the same manner as the other women
do. She disappeared, and after some speeches a new song was sung
and she came out again with three assistants.

Now the Walas’axa’, the dance of the clan G-1'g-ilgam, commenced.
Nu‘xnémis and two messengers stood at the right-hand rear entrance
of the curtain. He gave a signal for the singers to beat time and to
sing, and out came a great many of the members of the Kwakiutl
tribe, wearing wolf headdresses. They were about fifty in all, and as
soon as they had stepped out from behind the curtain they turned
around and began a procession around the fire. In front of the fire
they turned again and continued their circuit. They held their fists
in front of their bodies, the thumbs turned upward. While they were
walking, they cried “you, hou.” After they had gone around the fire
they disappeared again behind the left entrance of the curtain. La/g-us
made a speech, and then they began a second circuit in the same
manner as before. When they had made their fourth circuit, they
stopped before entering the partition again. They kneeled around the
fire, resting on their fists and knees. Now Nu’xnemis began a song,
which was accompanied by rhythmical motions. They made another
circuit and disappeared behind the curtain (Plate 36),

XI. CEREMONIALS OF THE OTHER TRIBES OF KWAKIUTL LINEAGE.

The winter dance of the Koskimo begins in the month of November.
In the evening, before the ceremonies are to begin, a number of boys are
sent out to gather kelp. They return during the night and enter the
village at the south end, blowing on the tubes of kelp, and produ-
cing a noise like that of large horns. At the same time a drum is
placed in the river so that the wooden band is in the water while the
skin is held just above the surface. The beating of this drum pro-
duces a very loud sound. As soon as the young men have passed
through the village, they stop blowing their kelp horns and the drum
stops at the same time. Then all the people in the houses begin to
sing their secret songs, and continue to sing until the morning, when
they come out of the houses. Then the chiefs go from house to house
and ask the people if they know what produced the noise of the pre-
ceding night. Some will reply that they did not hear it, others that
they heard it, and still others that they had seen one of their dead
relatives, who told them that he and the other ghosts came to take
the son or the daughter of one of the inhabitants away. The chiefs
continue to go from house to house until they come to that of the
young manor young woman who is to be initiated during the following
ceremonies. When they enter his room, they see that he has dis-
appeared. Only his shirt and blanket remain. These are covered
with blood. The chief seizes the garments, takes them out of the
house, and calls all the people together, asking for the murderer of the
youth. A great commotion ensues, all the people running about. At

.

last they begin to blacken their faces and take their weapons, ready
to fight among themselves.

Now all of a sudden a person is heard a ery on the point of land at
the west end of the village, ‘“‘hamamamama.” The people at once go
to see who is there. Now the master of ceremonies of the winter
danee, whose name is Ama’k, rises, and begins to call all the people by
their winter names. The people are surprised at his doing so, and
object. He, however, does not listen to them, and merely warns them
not to be bitten by the Ha’/maa. Then he calls four men whose names
are Loakwaxsta6k, WalkaLtsumt, A/Labala, and Hena/wa, and asks
them to go in a canoe to the point of land where the sound was heard,
in order to ascertain what produced it. The four men rise and enter
the house, in which the ha/mats’a assemble at the same time. Soon
they come out again, their faces blackened, rings of red cedar bark
around their heads and around their necks, and paddles in their hands.
The people inquire why they are dressed up in this manner, to which
they reply that it is a protection against the lurking danger at the
point of land to which they are going. They go down to a canoe and
paddle slowly to the point of land. As soon as they approach it, the
sound “hamamamama” is heard again. Themen pretend to be scared,
and paddle back to the beach. They ask some of the 10]0/LalaL, or
ghost dancers, to go with them.

Then the master of ceremonies asks four of the 1010/LalaL to accom-
pany the four men. The 1016’LalaL dress up and sit close together in
the middle of the canoe while the four men are paddling toward the
point. As soon as they approach it the same sound is heard. Then
the men in the bow of the canoe paddle backward while the steersman
paddles forward and brings the canoe up to the point of land. As
soon as they touch the land the four 1olo’/LalaL jump ashore and run
into the woods, where they stay for a few minutes. Then they come
back to the canoe and sit down in the same place as before. The other
four men appear to be scared, but not a word is said. They paddle
back to the village, and when they come to the shore, they inform the
master of ceremonies that they shall not go back again, because they
are too much scared. Upon a question of the master of ceremonies
they say that they did not see anything, but that the sound seared
them. He compels them to return and to investigate the cause of the
noise. The 1olo/LalaL have stayed in the canoe all this time, waiting
for the other four men toreturn. They paddle back to the point of land,
and the four 101l60/LalaL jump ashore again and run into the woods,
where they stay a few minutes. They come back, sit down in the
middle of the canoe, and the four men paddle back again to the village.
Now the four Jolo’/LalaL jump ashore and go into the house of the
father of the young man who had disappeared. The four paddlers rise
and say that they have seen the missing youth among the ghosts at the
point. The people all go into the house of the master of ceremonies
608 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and take their seats. ‘The master addresses them, asking them to get
ready to fight the ghosts. He calls four ya/lakuen6ox (men who have
secret songs), and bids them to stand in their places—that is, one in
each corner of the house. Now the master of ceremonies takes a raven
rattle and steps to the singer standing in the right-hand front corner
of the house. He gives him the rattle and asks him to sing the ghost
song: ‘Lo ho ho ho lo ho ho ho hé hama ma.” When he has finished this
song, the singer turns to the right, says “ hamamamama,” and returns
the rattle to the master of ceremonies, who goes diagonally across the
house to the left-hand rear corner. He gives the rattle to the man
standing there, who repeats the same song, turns around, says ‘“ hama-
mamama,” and returns the rattle to the master of ceremonies, who goes
to the left-hand front corner of the house and repeats the same ceremony
there. Last he goes across to the right-hand rear corner of the house
and gives the rattle to the fourth singer, who repeats the same song,
singing, however, louder and turning faster than the others. After
this has been done, the four men sit down again.. Now the master of
ceremonies requests the people to get their ornaments of red cedar
bark and to dress up. The people take them out from under their
blankets and put them on. Then he asks the father of the novice to
get some eagle down and to strew it on the heads of the people.
After this has been done, he orders the 1010’/LalaL to assemble in one
place in the house. He makes the ha/mats’a assemble in another place;
the hai‘alik-ilaL, pa’xalalaL, ya’/yatalaL, na/naualaq, sé/ilis, ts’e/kois,
xoe/LxoeLawatala, ha/winalaL, 1o’kwasola (or lalaxs6la) all assemble.
Then he asks the people to prepare to fight the ghosts. All of them
leave the house and go down to the canoes, each society in a canoe by
themseives. Only the ha/mats’a and the hé/lig-a stay ashore. They
paddle toward the point where the ery of the ghosts was heard, and as
soon as they reach there, they hear again somebody calling ‘‘ hamama-
mama.” The people look frightened. Some jump into the water, others
faint, and all pretend not to know what they are doing. Only the
canoe in which the 10lo’LalaL are assembled goes on undisturbed.
They go ashore and take the novice, who had disappeared, from among
the ghosts. They bring him down to their canoe and paddle slowly
back toward the village. During this time all the other canoes are
drifting with the tide, as the people have not recovered from their
fright. As soon as the 10]0/LalaL land, the ha/mats’as, who are expect-
ing them, begin to get excited and run down to the beach. Then the
master of ceremonies orders a man, whose name is LaliLqotsastala, to
bring the other canoes back. He takes a small canoe, paddles out
toward the canoes, and brings them back one by one. As soon as they
land, the lolo‘LalaL go down and carry the people up to the house as
though they were dead. Then the 1610’LalaL shamans try to restore
them to life, while at the same time the ha/mats’as are running from
house to house excited, driving the people out as soon as they have

a el

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 609

been restored by the efforts of the shamans. This continues until the
ma/‘maq’a rises and sings his song, dancing around the fire. He is con-
sidered more powerful than the ha/mats’a, and by his song compels
him to leave the house.

Then all the people go to their houses and have their breakfast. In
the evening the ye/wix-ila invites the tribe to his house. Then they
begin to sing the song of the ghosts, as follows: ‘* Lo ho ho i, lo ho
ho 0, 10 ho ho a hu omama.” This song is repeated four times. As
soon as they stop, the master of ceremonies addresses the people, saying
that they will try to restore the youth who had been taken away by
the ghosts. While he is talking, somebody is heard to ery “ hamama-
mama” outside the house. They look about as though they were fright-
ened, and ask each other what may be the cause of the noise. The
sound is heard four times; then an old man jumps into the door and
informs the people that the Jolo/LalaL are approaching, and requests
the people to have their batons ready to beat time. As soon as he has
finished speaking, the door opens and the 1J6lo/LalaL enter crying
“hamamamama.” The people repeat the cry and begin to beat time.
The ghost dancers enter and dance in a stooping position. They wear
rings of cedar bark on their heads, from which a veil of split white
bark is hanging down over their faces. They go around ‘the fire until
they come to the left-hand corner of the house. Here they sit down in
a circle crying again “‘hamamamama.” When they become silent, the
master of ceremonies asks La/HiLqotsastala to see if the ghosts have
come with the dancers. As soon as he approaches them, they begin to
ery again ‘“hamamamama,” but he does not stop. He steps up to them,
sits down among them and looks for the ghosts. After a short while,
he returns to the master of ceremonies and says that he has seen some
of his dead relatives in a hole in the ground, and that the 101l0/LalaL
were sitting around the hoie and talking to the ghosts. He asks the
master of ceremonies for a strong rope. The latter calls a man whose
name is Tsaksta/laqoals to get the rope which his grandfather left
him. This means that this office is hereditary. Tsaksta/laqoals goes
and brings the rope into the house. He also brings twenty blankets,
which are called the weight of the rope of the ghosts. The master of
ceremonies gives one end of the rope to one of the 161l0’/LalaL. The
latter pretends to tie the end of the rope arouud the waist of the new
1610’LalaL in order to prevent his being taken away by the ghosts.

As soon as this is done, the tribe divide into two groups, the clan
of the yée/wix ila and their rivals. The latter sit close to the door.
Then the master of ceremonies gives the twenty blankets to the rivals.
After this he calls up all the ba’akwas—i. e., those who belong to
the clan of the ye/wixila. As soon as they take hold of the rope, the
ye’wixila distributes blankets among his rival clan. Then he calls
upon the people of his clan to touch the rope. They come one after the
other and distribute blankets among the other clan. Last of all the

610 ' REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

chief comes, who gives away twenty blankets. The blankets which are
given away are supposed to be a weight attached to the rope, and the
last gift of twenty blankets breaks the rope.

Then one of the members of the rival clan jumps up. He takes hold
of the broken rope, and while he is holding it calls the chief of his own
clan to fetch the rope which he inherited from his grandfather. The
chiefreturns with the rope and twenty blankets. He ties the two broken
ends together with his rope and says that he will be able to bring the
ghost out of the ground. He calls his clan to leave the door and to come
to the rear of the house. Now the ye/wix:ila’s clan take their seat near
the door. The other clan goes through the same ceremony, and last of
all the chief brings forty blankets, which cause the rope to break. This
means that the clan whose rope did not break until forty blankets were
attached to it is more powerful than the other one. After the rope
breaks, the whole tribe sings as follows:!

Look up to our world, look up to our world! Chief! Procurer of wealth!

This song is repeated four times. The ye’wix-ila distributes more
blankets among the people, who then go home. On the following day
the 1010/LalaL are seen to walk about the village with rough rings of
cedar bark on their heads, the latter being strewn with down, and their
faces blackened. About midnight of this day a number of men secretly
climb the roofs of the houses of the village and begin to whirl the whirr-
ing sticks””’ (fig. 189). The noise of these sticks is supposed to be
the voice of Hai‘aLilaqas or Wina/lag-ilis, who comes to take away
another novice. This noise is repeated four times, each time for about
ten minutes. Then the people must sing their secret songs in the
houses. When the noise stops, a ha/mats’a is heard to shout in the
bush, and on the next morning a blanket is found in front of one of the
houses. The people gather around it and try to discover whose
blanket it is. After they have ascertained the owner of the blanket,
they say, ‘** It was certainly he whom we heard in the woods,” and his
father adds that Hai/aLilaqas probably eame and has taken his son
to BaxbakualanuXsi/wae. The people request him to clean his house
and prepare for the return of the novice. The man goes into his house
at once, cleans it, and as soon as he is ready, the people enter. He asks
them to be ready for the return of the ha/mats’a, as he might come back
unexpectedly. The master of ceremonies asks the singing master to
sing the new songs for the ha/mats’a, of which there are four. After
the singing master has sung these songs, the master of ceremonies
requests the new ye’wix‘ila to prepare a feast. The people take-their
places and begin to sing the four songs cf the old ha/mats’a. After
these are sung, the feast is spread. When the people have entered, the
old ha/mats’a comes out of his room and drives them out of the house

and into the water, where he keeps them until the ma/maq’a appeals
and drives the ha’mats’a back into the house.

During these days the second ye/wixila is collecting all the debts
which are due him, and on the following morning the new ha/mats’a
is seen on the same point of land where the first one was recovered.
The people go up to him, catch him, and bring him to the singing
house (kekoalela/tse), Then they all- begin to sing the four new songs,
the first two accompanied by fast beating, the last two by slow beat-
ing. After these songs the ha/mats’a is led back into his bedroom.
About 8 o’clock in the evening he leaves the house,
returns to the woods, and stays there until his father
has invited all the people to his house to sing for
him. As soon as they are assembled they begin to
beat time. After they have done so for about five
minutes, one man cries “yau.” The people repeat
this cry four times. They have hardly done so when
the ha/mats’a enters and they begin to sing. The
ha/‘mats’a dances around the fire and at the end of
the last song disappears in his bedroom. This night
all the dances are shown in a festival similar to the
kik-i/Inala of the Kwakiutl.!

On the following morning the ye/wix-ila invites all
the people to his house, and gives a feast to the men,
women, and children. At the end of the feast every-
body receives a blanket ‘‘to wipe the mouth with.”
After this the ha’mats’a is allowed to bite four times,
once every fourth day. During this time he is
purified in a way similar to that of the ha/mats’a of
the Kwakiutl.

After the last night of the winter dance, the ye’. Fig. 189.

house. They are covered with balsam pine branches, “7”
and blood is dripping from their bodies. They are called the Wina’-

suddenly take the cedar bark rings from the heads of several men.
They then leave the house again as suddenly as they entered. The
men whose cedar bark rings they have taken will give a winter dance
the following year. After this, the rest of the people take off their
cedar bark ornaments, tie handkerchiefs around their heads, and begin
to sing summer songs.

612 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

During a feast the young man who is to be initiated suddenly faints.
At once a number of newly initiated shamans are called to investigate
the cause of his sickness. They are unable to ascertain what ails the
young man, and send for the older shamans. ‘They feel all over the body
of the youth, and finally declare that the spirit Wina‘lag-ilis has taken
possession of him. Then a sail is stretched across the rear of the house
and the patient is placed behind it. Tle house is cleaned, and every-
body is invited—men, women, and children. Henceforth this house
will be the dancing house. The q’a/qanas, who correspond to the
me/émqoat of the Kwakiutl, must stay in this house after they have
once entered it until the end of the whole ceremonial. The profane
are not allowed to pass the front of the house above high-water mark.

The master of ceremonies asks the people to sing the following song,
which is supposed to have the power of restoring the patient to life:

Hayas ahono lalii ya hono hanii hiiu.
Do not cry, you will come back safely.!

An old shaman stands by the patient, feeling his body. The song has
no effect upon the young man, and the master of ceremonies requests
the people to try another means of restoring him to life. Boxes are
placed in front of all the assembled people, and at a signal they beat
time rapidly with their batons, ending with a loud rap. This is repeated
four times.

The above song belongs to the clan Naa/nqaenox (always staying at
home), while the beating of time belongs to the clan La‘lauiLEla, who
obtained it from the Awi’/k’énox. The shaman says that the beating
of time had the desired effect upon the patient. After this the people
assume their winter names and rearrange themselves in groups as
enumerated on page 419.

On the same night the festival called qap’é’k" is celebrated. In the
morning of this day a number of young men were sent out to collect
alder bark and to make red cedar bark, which is distributed among the
people in the evening. In payment for their services they receive a
special allotment of fod. When the people assemble for the qap’e’k",
the highest ha’mats’a is first led to his seat. The other ha/mats’as are
placed at his side. They are followed by the ts’é/kois and by the
haialik-alaL. The que’qutsa take their seats last. They sit on each
side near the door. As many que/qutsa as there are ha/mats’as are
charged with the making of the head rings of the latter. These que’-
qutsa all stand on the right-hand side of the door, each holding his
ring. They have a leader, whose office is hereditary. They walk around
the fire four times, singing. ‘Then they step in front of the ha/mats’as,
and on a signal they all put the neck rings around them. Ata sec-
ond signal they put the head rings on the heads of the ha/mats’as,
and finally they strew their heads with down. Then the ha/mats’a’s
whistle is heard, and the people distribute quickly the red cedar bark

among the others. The que/qutsa blacken their faces. The ha/mats’a
begins to get excited and bites the people. He must bite a certain
man first, whose duty it is to offer himself to the ha/mats’a when he
gets excited for the first time. his office or duty is hereditary. The
ha/mats’a carries a stick and drives the people around the fire. During
the ensuing excitement another novice disappears, leaving his blood-
covered blanket behind. It is found, and under great excitement
inquiries are made as to who is missing, until finally the father exclaims
that his child has disappeared. Then the ha/mshamtsks dances.

Sometimes the disappearance of the novice takes place in a different
way. Four men go on the roof of the house during the night and,
running about, ery “‘himhmhm.” This noise is taken by the people to
signify the approach of Wina‘lagvilis. On the following morning it is
found that one of the young men has disappeared, leaving his blanket
behind, which is covered with blood.

Still another way of beginning the Lé’xalak" is the following: The
ma/maq’a dances in his house, and suddenly throws his magie stick,
which is believed to fly through the walls of the house and to hit the
person who is to be initiated and who lives in another house. The
youth falls down, and then the parents call the shaman to cure him.
The ceremony continues as described above.

To return to the festival. After the ha/mshamtsEs has finished his
dance and has bitten a person, the people begin eating. They do not
feed the ha’mats’a first, as is done by the Kwakiutl. Then they sing
four times the song of the Naa/nqaénox ;' three times they sing the
burden only, the fourth time they sing the words:

Do not ery, you will come back safely.

This is the end of the ceremonies of the first night. On the second
and third night the same songs are repeated. Every night the shaman
visits the novice, who is hidden behind the curtain. He reports that
he is feeling better, and the third night he says that he is shaking
violently.

The fourth night the same songs are repeated. The shaman visits
the novice again, and when he returns, he says, “ Listen; he is singing
his secret song.” Now nobody is allowed to speak or to cough. Then
they hear, as though from a great distance, the sound of a new song,
which is growing Jouder and louder. The secret song is sung four
times. The singing master must listen attentively, because after the
fourth time he must repeat it. Two new songs are heard that night.
On the following night the same ceremony is repeated, and two more
songs are learned by the people. Twelve que/qutsa women dance this
night. Their faces are blackened and they wear red cedar bark.
Their dance is accompanied by the beating of batons. One man and
one woman are stationed at the entrance to the secret room in which

614 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

When the twelve women are about to finish their dance, the novice
is seen to come out of his secret room. He does not wear any orna-
ments of red cedar bark.

He dances on the four following nights. On the following day there
is an intermission of the ceremonies. The next day the ye/wix-ila
invites all the people to his house and asks them to prepare for the
purification of the novice, which will take place on the fourth day.
He also requests three officers whose offices are hereditary to pre-
pare themselves for this ceremony. These officers are the man who
makes the tongs, his naine is Q’aqia’s; the one who uses the tongs,
his name is NE/msqEmg:ala; and the one who calls the people to the
washing. Early in the morning of the fourth day the last-named
officer must go to every house, and, beating the doors with his baton,
he must ery, “Yau, yau, listen, listen. There is food for you from
(Qoa/yukolax‘ilis), from (7a/xus’EmL).”!' The first is the q’a’/q’anas
name, the second the queé’qutsa name, of the novice. In the evening
all the people assemble in the dancing house. Then the first of these
men makes a pair of tongs, which are wound with red and white cedar
bark and put up on the west side of the house. A ladder which has
only four steps is placed against one of the rafters on the left-hand
side of the fire (that is, to the left when facing the rear of the house).
The man who made the ladder climbs it, and puts his head through the
roof. When he comes down, the people beat the boards and the drum.
At midnight he ascends the ladder again. He goes up a third time
between midnight and dawn, and the fourth time when the day begins
to dawn. This is to secure good weather. Every time when he comes
back, he sings:

Ha, ha! you do not give me a favorable answer, you who are to bring the southeast
wind by washing our novice.?

The officer who made the ladder is given a dish in payment for his
work. The one who made the tongs receives a knife and a hammer.
The one who carries the tongs receives a belt; another belt is given to
the officer who invited the people. Sometimes paddles, canoes, or
blankets are given to them, but these are always called dish, knife, or
belt, as the case may be.

After the man has come down the ladder the fourth time, NE/msqEm-
gala takes the tongs down and goes around the fire four times, hold-
ing the tongs stretched forward. He calls a man to open the door, and
strikes the stick which is spreading the tongs four times. The fourth
time he hits it sothat it flies out of the door. Then hetakes two stones out
of the fire, one after the other, repeating the motion three times in each
‘case before actually taking them up. He throws them into the water in
the same way, and dips them up also after having repeated the motion

three times, really dipping up the water the fourth time. The novice
sits right next to the bucket in which the water is kept. He has no
rings of red cedar bark. Then he is washed.

Then NE’msqEmgala places the tongs vertically into the fire, the
open end downward. The cedar bark with which they are wound
catches fire, and then he lets them go. It is expected that the wind
will blow in whichever direction they fall. Then the officer who made
the tongs makes head rings of red cedar bark for all the people, who
put them on. ‘The singing master makes a new song, and singing it
they go around the fire, and leave the house, led by the yiai/atalaL, who
carries a small rattle. This office is also hereditary. They go through
the whole village, and inform the people that the purification of the
novice has been performed that morning. The people put their masks
in order, and gather the property which they are going to give away at

‘the festival which is to be held that evening. This.night the people

are not arranged according to the groups described above, but accord-
ing to their clans. In the morning a man is sent around to call the
people. He says, ‘Let us go into the house and beat the boards, for
we have purified him. Let us go at once.”!

First the boys enter the house and begin to beat time. Then the
various groups enter one after the other, each carrying the property
which they are going to give away during the festival. Whenever a
group enters, the boys beat time. They imitate the movements of the
animals which they represent. Then each group gives presents to
the others, and at this time the ha’mats’a, ma/maq’a, and the other
q’a’/q’anas, pay for the damage they have done. Next, three men
are called up,—ME‘IxmEk*, a Naqo’/mgvilisala; Ts’E1é, a G-é/xsEm; and
Tsau‘xstalag-ilis, a G-i/g-ilqgam,—who each sing a song, accompanied by
the people. M&’IxmEk"’s song is as follows:?

I will listen to the old tale to which this refers.
I will listen to what is told about it.

After they have finished their songs, a man named Wiyo’tsEm is
called up. He puts on a canoe sail like a blanket, and goes around
the fire dragging the sail behind him. This means that he is sweep-
ing the house for the dancers, who will enter next. The first dancer to
enter is the wa/tanEm. He is followed by the ghost dancer, the 0/lala,
hai’alik-aue, ts’e/kois, wi/x:sa ha/mats’a (= hamtsEtsoe), and ha/mats’a.

While the ha‘mats’a is biting the people, the ma/inaq’a enters and
drives the ha’/mats’a away. Then the new dancer comes out of his
secretroom. If he has a mask, he returns to his secret room and dances
again. Four women dance with him, two in each corner in the rear of

the house, while the novice is dancing in the middle of the rear of the
house. The dance is accompanied by two new songs and by the two
songs that were used at the ceremonial of purification. While he is
dancing, the ye’wix-ila distributes his presents among the people. On
the following day another man gives a feast in the house of the
ye’wixila. When all the people have entered the house, the novice
is called to come out of his secret room. The people sing one song,
and he dances alone and sits down. Again his father distributes pres-
ents among the other clans. The novice is allowed to take part in the
feast. During the four following days the novice wears head rings
of red cedar bark. After four days, another man gives a feast in the
same house. When all have entered, the novice is called out of his
secret room. He wears a smaller head ring now. Two more feasts are
given in the same way at intervals of four days. Every time the dancer
wears a smaller head ring.

At the end of the last night the q’a’q’anas, who have stayed in the
dancing house right through the whole ceremonial, are led home by
their wives.

It will be noticed that in these ceremonials the festival corresponding
to the k-ik-i/Inala of the Kwakiutl is celebrated after the return of the
novice. Among the La/Lasiqoala when the novice has disappeared in
the woods (being a la/xsa), his whistles are suddenly heard on the roof
of the house or behind the houses. At night, while the people are
assembled, he is heard on the roof of the house, but disappears again.
On the following morning he is seen on a point of land. Four canoes
are lashed together and connected by planks. Thus the people paddle
up to him and bring him back. The same night all the dances are
performed.

The winter dance ceremonies of the Ts’a/watEenox differ from those
described heretofore. I have received from Mr. Hunt detailed informa-
tion only in regard to the closing ceremonies, while the progress of the
ceremonial seems to be much like that of the Kwakiutl. The beginning
is as follows:

The ye/wixila invites all the people to his house, where they sit down
according to their clans. Then he asks his wife to bring food. While
the food is being prepared, the people sing. In the middle of the third
song the whistles are heard on the roof of the house. The people
stop singing. They group themselves at once according to their
dances and societies. They burn the salmon, because it was prepared
before the beginning of the winter dance. That night they begin their
ceremonies.

On March 14, 1895, they concluded their ceremonies as follows:

Pa’xalats’e, chief of the T’Ena’/xtax, gave away blankets during the
winter ceremonial. At night two men went into every house, and said
at the door: “Now we will tame your dancer, Ts’a’/mqoagaLe. Now
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. Gila

we will tame your dancer, Na’/nts’e. Now we will see the dance of
Laqoasalag‘ilis. Now we will see the dance of Yakamansa/lag:ilis.”

Then the otner one said, ‘‘ Be quick now, dancers! We will assemble,
friends, while it is day,” and they went back to the dancing house.

After some time the two men went again to every house, and the first
one said: ‘*We come back to call you.” The second one said: ‘ Now
let us go to the house, dancers. It is late in the evening. We have
no fuel, friends. Let us all go together.” Thus they said at every
house, and went back to the dancing house.

Then the two men went again and looked about in the house and
said: ‘Now all our friends are in;” and when they discovered that
some one was missing they went to him and said: ‘“ You are the only
one who is still missing.” ‘

When they were all in, Pa/xalats’é arose and spoke: I thank you,
my great friends, that you have come to our dancing house. Remain
here in the dancing house of ya’mtalaL, the great shaman, who van-
quished our Master, Q’aniqilak", at Ts’a/wate. This is the winter dancing
house of Nau/alagumqa, the great shaman at Ts’a’/wate. This is the
winter dancing house of Ba/Lalag-ilak", who gained victory over
We’qaé of the Le/kwilt6q (see p. 416). Those whom I named had
large cedar bark ornaments. Thus we say, La‘ingal; thus we say,
Nu’/xnemis. Therefore I gain the victory over the chiefs of all the
tribes, for in the beginning they were vanquished by ya’mtalaL and
Naw alagumqa and Baxia‘lag:ilak". Now take care, my friends!” He
turned to his tribe and said to them, “I say so, Ta’/mXuak-as; I say
so, Xu/gamsila; I say so, P’a/Ixalasqam; I say so, Lé’/na; I say so, my
friends. Now take care, my great friends; give me my rattle that I
may call the spirit of the ceremonial. Therefore I tell you to be care-
ful, friends.” They gave him the rattle; he shook it and sang “hoip,
Op, Op, Op.” He stopped and looked upward as though he was expect-
ing the spirit. The chiefs said: ‘‘Take care, friend, else you might not
get the spirit of the winter ceremonial.” Again he shook his rattle
and sang the secret song of Ts’awata/lalis:

1. Now listen! ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Hawo.
2. Now sing! ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Hawo.
3. Now sing your song, ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Hawo,

d d

4. Now he comes to me, ya, ya, ya, greatest of all dancers! Hawo.

Then he ended his song, and the cries of many ha/mats’as were
heard among the trees. They cried ‘wip, wip, wip, wip,” like the
ha/mshamtsEs.

As soon as the cries ceased, Ta/mXuak-as spoke: “Friends on the
other side of the house, did you hear what we obtained from our grand-
fathers? You heard that it belongs to the earliest legends of the
world. Now take care, friends, we do not need to be frightened of
anything, because, as you heard, my great cedar bark ring came to me
from my grandfather.” Then Pa/xalats’é shook his rattle again and
618 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

sang the same song as before. When he stopped singing, the cry of
the ha/mshamtsEs was heard again near the house.

Now Pa/xalats’é shook his rattle again and sang his secret song.
When he stopped, the ery “wip, wip, wip” was heard just behind the
dancing house. He sang his secret song a fourth time. Then the cry
‘wip, wip, wip” was heard at the door of the house. The first of the
dancers entered and sang his secret song. They were all dressed in
hemlock branches, which were wound around their heads and necks.
This is the secret song of their leader:

1. Now listen, ani’ ana’ to my shaman’s song. Ana’, ana’ hamamama, hamamama’.
2. Now listen to the cry of the ha/mat’sa, because I am a cannibal, because Iam a
shaman, ana, ana, hamamama, hamamama, hamamama.

Then the leader, Ts’é/koa by name, stopped singing. When he came
near the fire, to the middle of the house, he turned, and at the same
time said “hoi’p, hoi’p, hoi’/p.” Thus forty men came into the house,
while the old men who were sitting in the rear of the house began to
beat time. They went around the fire in a squatting position. Next,
a woman came. Her name was Ya/kusElagvilis. She had hemlock
branches around her neck. She sang the secret song of Nau/alaguingqa:

i. Hama! I was made a magician by the greatest of the dancers.
2. Hama! I was filled with magic by the greatest of the dancers.

When she stopped singing, she turned and all cried “wip, wip, wip,
wip.” Forty women were standing in the house. The old men began
to sing the song of ya’/mtalaL, which he sang in his contest with
Qa/nigilak" at Ts’a’wate, according to the tradition, when he gained
the victory over Qa/niqilak", at the time when they tried each other.
This is the song which he made against Qa/‘niqilak":

1. A small magician was he as compared to me.

2. The small magician was afraid of me.

3. I called his name, the name of the small magician.
4, And he tried to tame this greatest of all dancers.

When she stopped singing, T's’e’koa repeated his secret song. After
this song all the men and women turned to the left and cried ‘“ wip,
wip, wip.” Then the old men repeated ya/mtalaL’s song. When they
stopped, Ts’e’koa repeated the song of Ba/Lalag-ilak, the same which
he had sung when entering the house. When he had finished his
song, all the men and women turned to the left and said “hoi’p, wip,
wip, wip.” Once more the old men sang the song of ga/mtalaL. After
their song, Ts’e/koa repeated Ba/Lalag-ilaks song. All the men turned
to the left. The old men repeated the song which een sang in
his contest with Qa/‘niqilak".

Then All the men and women who had danced went out of the house,
and Ta/mXuak-as spoke: ‘¢ Wa, wa, friends. Did yousee this? What
you have seen, friends, on the other side of the house, that is what
we are afraid of; that is what makes life short; that is our Lord; that

is what we inherited from our grandfathers; that is our history; thatis
the great magician; that is »a’mtalaL, the great magician; the woman
is Nau/alagumqa. Thatis Ba/Lalag-ilak"; that is ya’mtalaL, who gained
the victory over Qa‘niqilak" at Ts’a/wate, and that is the cause why all
the tribes are vanquished by us, wa, wa. That is what I say, friends,
for Pa/xalats’é. The songs which you have heard are those of ya/m-
talat. Thatis his dance. . The secret song of the leader is the secret
song of Ba/Lalag-ilak", and the secret song of the woman is that of
Nauw/alaguinga. Ido not use new ways. The other tribes may invent
new things, wa, wa. ”

Now the boards of the house front were struck, and the people said:
“The cormorants are going to dive!” Then Xu’/gamsila entered the
house and said: ‘“‘ Beat the boards, friends.” The oid men beat the
boards, and the young chiefS entered. As soon as they had come in,
Xiti’/gamsila spoke: “These are the cormorants of Ts’a’wate. That is
the only place where they eat nothing but oulachon. Therefore they are
fat.!. Now beat the boards, friends.” The old men beat the boards,
and,the women came in, spreading their blankets. They had red cedar
bark ornaments on their heads, the same as the men. Then Xu/‘gamsila
spoke: “They are the sawbill ducks; they dive for property.” Now
Ta’mXuak-as spoke: “ Friends, what do you think? Shall we discard
the use of the red cedar bark which makes us happy? We shall only
be downhearted if we should discard it. We shall be asleep all the time.
Now, friends, we will finish this night. We will have the last dance of
thisseason. You, Pa/‘xalats’é, shall change our names this night. That
is what I say, P’alxalasqzEm.

Now HO/uElité arose and spoke: ‘This is your speech, Ta’/mXuak:as.
You said we would finish this night. Did you hear the speech of our
friend La/mg‘ala? He says they will take off the red cedar bark. I
will not take it off. That is what I say, KuLe/m; that is what I say,
Ts’a‘lgaxsta. I must accept the words of all our friends.”

Then arose Yu/x:yukwamas, chief of the Nimkish: ‘‘ These are your
speeches, friends. You wish to throw away the red cedar bark. Now
answer ny speech, Ta/m Xuak:as.”

Then the latter answered: “It is true. I said so because our friends
here do not treat in the right way the cedar bark of which we are afraid,
which we inherited from our grandfathers. It is our master, it makes
our life short. It is true I said we would finish to-night.”

Then Yu/x‘yukwamas spoke again: “Did you hear, friends? Did
you hear it, La/qoasqEm? Let them finish now. You finish to-night.
But I am waiting for the repayment of the marriage money to my
friends. Therefore I do not want to take off the cedar bark to-night.
You may change your names to-night, wa, wa. I say this, Nu’/xnemis;
Isay this, HO/LElité; [say this,La/mg-ala; wa. It is a great thing that

620 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

we are talking about, my tribe.” Then Nuxnemis arose and spoke:

“That is your speech, Ta’‘mXuak-as; we are all afraid of your speech,

ereat tribe! It is better that you finish to-night. Keep on in the old

ways of our grandfathers! I thank you, great tribe, keep on in this
way, my children! Do not abuse what we inherited from our grand-
fathers. Your words are true. This cedar bark will make life short
if it is not used in the right way. Now take care, friends! I say this,

K vakiutl, Ma/maléleqala, Nimkish, Ts’a/mas.” Then all the chiefs said

wa, wa.”

Now Ta/mXuak-as arose again and spoke: “Thank you, friends, for
your words. Now I will take off the red cedar bark to-night. Come,
friends, and you women, and let us dance. Let the tribes listen to us
and watch our customs.” Then the men and the women assembled and
sang the old song. Xigamsila carried a long notched pole about 7
feet long. This is his song:

1. Now dance! take off by means of your dance the great head ornament, the head
ornament that you inherited from the mask of the winter ceremonial worn by
the first of our tribe. WO, 6, 0, 0, 0, huwaia, huwaia, w6, 0, 0, 0, 0. (Here
all the people lifted their cedar bark ornaments. )

2. O let us now put away our great head ornaments. The head ornament that you
inherited from the mask of the winter ceremonial worn by the first of our
tribe. W6, 6, 6, 6, 6, hawaia, htwaia, wo, 6, 0, 0, d. (Here the people lifted
the head ornaments again.)

3. O let us now put down our great head ornaments, the head ornaments that you
inherited from the mask of the winter ceremonial worn by the first of our
tribe. WoO, 6, 6, 6, hiwaia, htwaia, wo, 0, 0, 0. (Here they lifted the orna-
ments again.)

4. O now dance and take off this our great head ornament, the head ornament that

you inherited from the mask of the winter ceremonial worn by the first of
our tribe. WoO, 6, 6, 6, htwaia, hiwaia, wo, 0, 6, 0.

No)

With this they lifted the ornaments again and put them in the notch
of the staff which Xa/gamsila was carrying. The song is the same as
the one which yja/mtalaL used when taking off his cedar bark orna-
ments. As soon as they had finished their song, they changed their
names. Now he whose name had been Xi/gamsila was called Ha/mts’it.
Then Neg:é/, whose name had been Pa/xalats’é, spoke: ‘My tribe,
now let some one rise who wants to take these red cedar bark orna-
ments for next winter.”

Then Ya/qoLas arose and spoke: “I come, Nug-e’, in answer to your
speech. I will take this red cedar bark.” Then he spread his blanket,
the cedar bark ornaments were thrown into it, and he hid them in his
bedroom. Then all the members of the T’Ena’xtax tribe tied handker-
chiefs around their heads. They had finished their winter dance.
Walas Nug:é! distributed blankets. They did not give first to the
ha/mats’a, but to the head chief.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 621

eT I et AO AUXeA,

I pointed out at a former place that the La/Lasiqoala group the dances
in two classes—the ts’e’/ts’aeqa and the no/nLEm. The no/nLEm
dances are closely connected with the clans, and during their perform-
ance the ordinary social system remains in full foree. The Kwakiutl
have only a few of these dances which they call Lad/laxa, which name
is also sometimes used by the La‘Lasiqoala. It is difficult to establish
any fundamental difference between a Lad‘laxa dance and a ts’é’ts’aéqa
dance, as in both cases a hereditary genius initiates the novice, and
as in both ceremonials membership is obtained in the same manner—
through marriage, or by killing a person who is entitled to the cere-
monial. The distinction is comparatively clear among the La/Lasiqoala
and the affiliated tribes. Only those dances which derive their origin
from BaxbakualanuXsi/wae and his following, or from Wina‘lag-ilis,
are ts’e’ts’aeqa; all others are no/nLEm. ‘To this class belong all the
animals, and we find that they are much more clearly clan deities than
the former class. At the same time it is stated distinctly that the whole
ceremonial was introduced through intermarriage with the northern
tribes, particularly the He‘iltsuq. This consciousness of an entirely
foreign origin of all the Laod/laxa dances is still stronger among the
Kwakiutl, while many dances which undoubtedly had the same origin
have been incorporated by them in the ts’é/ts’aeqa.

The La/Lasiqoala use in the no/nLEm ceremonial cormorant down
in place of eagle down, white cedar bark in place of red cedar bark,
red paint in place of black paint. They sing both profane songs
and ts’é‘ts’aeqa songs. The celebration takes place in November and
December.

Among the Kwakiutl the Lao/laxa may be celebrated at any time of
the year. The man who desires to give the festival calls his clan or
tribe to his house and informs them of his plans. I am osliged to Mr.
George Hunt for the following description of such a meeting:

Ots’éstalis, a man whose mother was a He/iltsuq, was about to give a
Lao‘laxa. He invited his clan and spoke as follows:

‘““Now come, my tribe, come Ha/mts’it, come Yé/qawité, come G:e/so-
yagilis, come La/qoagila, come Tso’palis; come to hear the words of our
chief. Come Gue/tHla, come Q’o/‘moyue, Walas Kwakiutl, Q’o’mk-utis.
Thank you, my tribe, for coming. I must tell you about my plans. I
will show the dance which came down from heaven, the La0/laxa, the
coming night. Take care, my tribe, take care all of you, you second
class chiefs. I do not mean you, Chief Ila’mts’it. I mean Ma’Xua
and Wa/nuk" and O’ts’éstalis and Ma/mXua and La/lak-uts’a and you
third class young chiefs. Now take care, the supernatural power will
come to dwell among the tribes that are assembled at our camp, great
Kwakiutl! Now I will tell you what I carry in my hands. I will give
away my copper Wa/numeg-ila to the Na/q’oaqtoq, Koskimo, G:0/p’endox,
622 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and Va/sq’enox. Its price is 800 blankets. I think that will be enough
for these eight tribes here, and my other copper Ma/mukoalila shall fall
on the Mamaléléqala, Qoe/xsot7endx, and Nimkish, and the Lau’‘itsis
and Matilpé and T’nna’xtax and A’wa-iLala and Ts’a/watEendx and
Ha/xuamis. I think that is enough! Ma/‘mukoalila’s price is 6,000
blankets. This will be enough for the nine tribes, and I will sell for
food my copper Mau/aga, for which I paid 2,400 blankets at the time
when Lalak-uts’a wanted to sell it quickly at Me’mk-umlis. Else the
tribe might say that they are starving in this great country. But this
way they can find no fault when they come.” Sometimes ore or the
other of the old men said ‘‘yes, yes,” during his speech, and he con-
tinued: ‘Furthermore, such is my pride, that I will kill on this fire
this my copper, Dandalayu, which is groaning in my house. You all
know how mueb I paid for it. I bought it for 4,000 blankets. Now L
will break it in order to vanquish our rival. I will make my house a
fighting place for you, my tribe, wa. Now you know it all, my tribe;
be happy, chiefs! for this is the first time that so great an invitation has.
been issued. There are 9,200 blankets, besides the 4,000 blankets for
the copper that I am going to break. Now count all that the invitation
will cost. It is 13,200 blankets, and besides 250 button blankets, 270
silver bracelets, and 7,000 brass bracelets, 240 wash basins, and I do
not count the spoons, abalone shells, and the Lao/laxa head mask, and
the numerous kettles which I am expecting from my wife. Now you
know all my plans!”

Then Wa/k:as arose and spoke: ‘*Wa,my tribe! Did you hear what
our chief counted up? Are you not afraid of the various kinds of
property which he is expecting? Now long life to you, O/ts’estalis,
you who were made a chief yy your fathers. ‘Take care of our chief,
my tribe. Take care, Gue'tEla, Q’o’moyue, Walas Kwakiutl, and
Q’o/mk-utis. He is vomiting everything that he has in his mind. My
tribe, are you not also glad of our chief? I think you are proud in
your hearts. Thank you, O'ts’estalis. Thank you from my heart, chief.
I wish you long life. You will be the first of all the chiefs of all
tribes. So I say, T's’0’palis, thus I say, Hii/masaqa, G-ésoyag-ilis,
Ma/koayalisame, Da/dants’it, La‘lakanxit, wa, wa. So we Say, our
whole tribe.”

Then arose Ma/mXua: “That is your speech, Chief O'ts’éstalis; that
is your speech, Wa/k-as. Thank you, chief. How pretty is my chief!
Thank you, friend. Now my heart is alive, for I was afraid when I
heard the news of our rival. Ho, ho, ho. Now | lift the heavy weight
of your speech, chief. Thank you, brother. So I say for my whole
tribe.” Then O/mx’it arose and said: “Thank you for your speech,
O’ts’éstalis. Long life to youfor your speech. How well you stand on
our earth. You will be the only post of our world. The chiefs of all
the tribes will be jealous of you, you overhanging mountain, you chief
who can not be equaled. You do not need to fear anything. How

great is your name, chief. Now you made my back strong. Take
care, my tribe, and wish long life to our chiefs.” Kverybody applauded
his speech. Then O/mx”it sat down.

Next Ha’mEsk-inis arose and spoke. He said: ‘My tribe, are you
not ashamed of this young man? He will be your chief, Kwakiutl! I
am half ashamed myself on account of the amounts counted. Go on,
my son, be proud of what you said.” Then he lifted his right hand
and shouted : ‘“‘ Hide yourselves, tribes! never was seen such an amount
of property as our chief has called. Ya, ya, my tribe, do you not con-
sider the great mountain of property of O’ts’éstalis dreadful? He is
still a young man. Take care, my children, that you may have two
men who will give away blankets to the whole world. That is what I
say to the chiefs of the Kwakiutl, wa, wa.”

Now it was growing dark, and O’ts’éstalis arose and spoke: ‘Look

at me, my tribe! Pretty is this young man; he is growing up well.
Now I will sing the secret song and try to call the spirit of my dance.”
The people said: **Go on.” And he sung his secret song, calling

down the spirit of the Lao’laxa:

1. Tam the greatest magician, O hihihi, i, the greatest magician.

2. Talone am full of magic, O hihihi, i, the greatest magic.

4. I am the only one who knows to call down the magical power, the greatest magic.

Come now, magical power, O hihihi, i, greatest magic.

AS soon as he had finished his song the noise of whistles came down
to the roof of the house. Then they called all the women and children.

was glad that the people had come quickly, and said: ‘ Yes, my tribe,
you have done right that you have come to this large house. Make
yourselves comfortable. Dout be in a hurry to go home to your
houses. Thus I say, Wa/k-as. Thus I say, Om’‘x”it, wa, wa.” Then
the songmakers sang, and the people sat around them learning the

songs of the dancer. When all knew the song, O’ts’estalis arose and

sang:
Ya, I am the first, hei, ya, ha.
Ya, my speech is the highest, hei, ya, ha.

He stopped singing and said: ‘+ Ho, ho, ho! Yes, my tribe. Thus I
lift the heavy weight of my wealth. Now we will eall all the tribes
that they may come in the morning. Now go to sleep. That is all,
friends.” Then all the people, men, women, and children, left the house.
The following morning the Kwakiutl went out in their canoes to invite
all the tribes.

As this festival was to be given to a number of tribes, all the Kwa-
kiutl took part in this meeting. When only the Kwakiutl are to be
present, the host announces his intention to his clan alone. Then, after
the meeting is over, he sends word to the chiefs of all the clans, advising
them that the Lao/laxa whistles will be heard that night. Then all
those who have celebrated a Lad/laxa before may go to ask him what
masks he intends to show, in order to make sure that he will not
infringe upon their rights. In the evening the whistles are heard to
blow behind the house of the man who is going to give the Lao’laxa.
After about ten minutes they stop, and then blow again. This is
repeated four times. For four nights the whistles are heard in the
woods behind the house. The fourth night, after they have been
blown in the woods three times, they are heard on the roof, and finally
in the bedroom. Then the man begins to sing his seeret song.

After finishing his songs he Steps out of the door and ealls all the
people, the Gueé’tEla first, then the (’o/moyue, Walas Kwakiutl, and
(’0'mk-utis, in the order of their rank. He informs them that the spirit

of the La0’laxa has come to his house, and requests them to wash and to

his house and sing. Then the young men enter the house and sing, aud

blankets among these young men. This signifies a promise to dis-
tribute food to all the people.

The young men put on the blankets and go from house to house
saying: “‘This is food which you will receive to-morrow. It belongs
to ———.'” They go back to the host’s house and return the
blankets to him. On the following morning all the young men assem-
ble again. They are given red paint to adorn their faces, and they
are sent to call the people to the promised feast. Only the men are
invited. After two calls all assemble and arrange in groups according
to their clans. As soon as all have assembled, the messengers join
their clans. Before the feast begins, four songs are sung, as is cus-
tomary, two by the Gué’tEla and two by the Q’o’moyue. Then the
host fills a ladle with grease and sends it to Hawaxalag-ilis, who is
the highest in rank, and to the others in order. During all this time
the Lao/laxa whistles are heard to blow in the
bedroom. When the grease has been eaten, the
relative of the host who is to be initiated comes out
of the bedroom in which the whistles are sounding
and begins to dance around the fire. He wears a
beautiful carved headdress with long ermine trail
(Plate 47). Allofa sudden he teak his mask off
and runs out. After a short while a dancer wear-
ing the Laod‘laxa mask comes in. His arrival is
ae announced by a relative of the host who is stationed

novice, for so we may call him, comes forward and continues the dance
which was interrupted before. The people accompany the dance by the_
Lao‘laxa song. After he has finished, a few women dance in honor of
the new Lao/laxa. The host joins them, carrying a pole about 6 feet
long on his shoulder. The pole indicates that on the next day he will
give another feast, to which he invites the people, after ending his dance.

In the evening the whole tribe, men, women, and children, assemble
in the host’s house to witness the dance, and the performance of the
morning 1s then repeated.

On the following morning the messengers go out again, dressed up
and having their faces painted red, to call tlie people to the second feast.
The ceremony of the preceding day is repeated, but another Lao‘laxa
dance may be Showa. This is repeated again in the evening, when the

the whole tribe assembles, and when all are seated in the house, the
host sings his secret Lao/laxa song. He is followed by the noviee,

pears and continues his dance. Then the host steps forward, and in a
speech gives the dancer the name belonging to the mask. This is the
end of the Lao/laxa proper, and the whistles are heard no longer. At
some festivals a number of masked persons, who represent speakers,
come in at this moment and take hold of the host. Upon being asked
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 629

what they want, they praise his liberality, saying that he made all the
tribes fat by the amount of grease he had given. Finally they are
taken out of the house. Then the blankets are placed on top of a
drum, which is laid down on its side, The man whose office itis to dis-
tribute blankets in the potlatch (da/qEmayaénox = taking the blanket
at its top edge), of whom there is one in each clan, sits on top of the
drum. His office is hereditary in the male line and considered as very
important. He calls the people’s names, and throws the blankets upon
a mat lying in front of the drum, A man standing next to him carries
the blankets to those who are to receive them. As soon as the blankets
intended for one clan are distributed, he calls, ‘ Let us change!”
This is the end of the Lao‘laxa.

The rattles used by the Lao/laxa dancer differ from those used in the
winter ceremonial. While most of the latter are round (figs. 51-60, pp.
435-440), the former have the shape of birds which carry a number of
figures on their backs (figs. 190, 191, pp. 623, 624). Most of these rattles
represent the raven with upturned tail. ‘The face of a hawk is carved
on the belly of the raven. A reclining figure is placed on its back.
The knees of this figure are raised and grasped by the hands. A
bird’s head is represented on the tail of the raven. These rattles are
undoubtedly copies of similar ones that are used by the Haida and

‘Tsimshian. The primary idea underlying the form of rattle seems to
have been lost, since the only explanation that has ever been given by
the northern Indians is to the effect that it was given to their ancestors
by asupernatural being. The Kwakiutl state that they obtained these
rattles, with the Lao/laxa ceremonies, from the He’iltsuq.

his antlers. Now let us drive him away. Let him jump far over the highest
chief, the one who is famous among all the tribes, the great deer, said by all to

These masks are used in the dance called Adixaneé/sElaL (Tongass

the north and they received the masks as presents (LO/kué) from the
Tongass. They are used by the La‘la-wiLEla in the no/nLEm. The
masks represent speakers; all sing and dance together. The names of
the individual masks are not known.

The Ts’0/noqoa is also used.in Lad‘laxa dances. When she enters,
she wears a large basket on her back, in which she carries coppers.
These are given to the host, who gives them away. In the legend, she
carries a basket into which she puts children, whom she takes to her
house.

As stated before, a number of the songs given in Chapter VIII, so
far as they belong to the La/Lasiqoala, must be counted in this group.

In another dance the sun mask (fig. 197, p. 630) is used. The outer
mask represents the cloudy sky, while the inner mask represents the
clear sunshine.

XIII. THe RELIGIOUS CEREMONIALS OF OTHER TRIBES OF THE
Nortu PAciFic Coast.
THE NOOTKA.

The Nootka speak a dialect distantly related to the Kwakiutl. They
have two ceremonials, which are analogous to the winter ceremonial of
the Kwakiutl. Good descriptions of the customs connected with these
ceremonials have been given by Sproat, Swan, Jewitt, and Knipping,
I will repeat here what I have said on this subject in another place.'
The name of the ceremonial among the Nootka is LO/koala, a Kwakiutl
word, which designates the finding of a manitou. The ceremonial cor-
responds very nearly to the Walas’axa’ and to the LO’koala of the
Kwakiutl (pp. 477, 478). Certain features are, however, embodied in it,
which correspond to other dances, mainly to the ma/tEm and the ha’-
mats’a. The Lo/koala are a secret society who celebrate their festivals
in winter only. They have a chief whose name is Yaqsyaqste’itq.
Anyone who wishes to join the LO/koala can do so, or the society may
invite a man to become a member. Then the friends of this man make
a collection in his behalf and turn over the property collected to the
chief of the LO/koala, who distributes it during a feast among the mem-
bers. Those who are not LO’koala are called wicta’k't, i. e., not being
shamans. The LO/koala is believed to have been instituted by the
wolves, the tradition being that a chief’s son was taken away by
the wolves, who tried to kill him, but, being unsuccessful in their
attempts, became his friends and taught him the Lo’koala. They
ordered him to teach his people the ceremonies on his return home.
They carried the youth back to his village. They also asked hii to
leave some red cedar bark for their own LO/koala behind, whenever
he moved from one place to another; a custom to which the Nootka
tribes still adhere. LKvery new member of the LO’koala must be ini-
tiated by the wolves. At night a pack of wolves—that is, Indians
dressed in wolf skins and wearing wolf masks—make their appear-
ance, seize the novice, and carry him into the woods. When the wolves
are heard outside the village coming, in order to fetch the novice,

’ Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 1890, page 47.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 633

the members of the LO’koala blacken their faces and sing the follow-
ing song: !
Among all the tribes is great excitement because I am LOo’koala,

On the following day the wolves return the novice dead. Then the
LO/koala must revive him. The wolves are supposed to have put
the magic stone hina? into his body, which must be removed in order
to restore him to life. The body is left outside the house and two
shamans go to remove the hina. It seems that this stone is quartz.
The idea is the same as that found among the Kwakiutl, where the
Ma/‘tEm is initiated by means of quartz, which is put into his body by
the spirit of his dance. The returning novice is called t/emak.

After the novices have been restored to life, they are painted red
and black. Blood is seen to stream from their mouths, and they run
at once down to the beach and jump into the water. Soon they are
found to drift lifeless on the water. A canoe is sent out and the bod-
ies are gathered in it. As soon as the canoe lands, they all return
to life, resort to the dancing house, to which none but the initiated
are admitted, and stay there for four days. At night, dances are per-
formed in the house, which the whole population is allowed to witness.
After the four days are over, the novices leave the house, their heads
being wound with wreaths of hemlock (?) branches. They go to the
river, in which they swim, and after some time are fetched back by
a canoe. They are almost exhausted from the exertions they have
undergone during the foregoing days. Novices must eat nothing but
dried fish and dried berries.

Each Lo/koala lasts four days. It is only celebrated when some
member of the tribe gives away a large amount of property to the
LO/koala, the most frequently occurring occasion being the initiation of
new members. Sometimes it is celebrated at the time of the ceremo-
nies which are practiced when a girl reaches maturity. The house of
the iiian who pays for the LO’koala seems to be the taboo house of the
society. As soon as the Lo’koala begins, the ordinary social organiza-
tion of the tribe is suspended, as is also the case among the Kwakiutl.
The people arrange themselves in companies or societies, which bear
the names of the various Nootka tribes, no matter to which tribe and
sept the persons actually belong. Each society has festivals of its own,
to which members of the other societies are not admitted, although
they may be invited. These societies are called t’paLt. Each has <¢
certain song, which is sung during their festivities.®

At night, when the whole tribe assemble in the taboo house, the
societies still keep together. They are hostile to each other, and
railleries between the various groups are continually going on. It

‘Appendix, page 731.

“Xuc‘la, Kwakiutl The x of the Kwakiutl is, in the Ts’Ecid‘ath dialect of the
Neotka, from whom I obtained the word, always changed into h; n and | alternate

SAppendix, pages 731, 732.
634 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

seems that there are no separate societies for men and women, but a
certain division must exist, as they seem to have separate feasts. When
aman, during a LO/koala, brings in any game, and he does not give half
of it to the women, but retains the whole for the use of the men, the
former will attack him and wrest the share due to them from the men.
In the same way the women must share all they get or cook with the men.

Originally each dance belonged to one family, and was transmitted
from generation to generation. Mother as well as father had the right
to transfer their dances to their children. Thus dances which belonged
to one tribe were transmitted to others. The dance was given to the
novice at the time of his or her initiation, and no more than one dance
could be given at atime. At present these restrictions are becoming
extinct. Whoever is rich enough to distribute a sufficient amount of
property may take any dance he likes. I was even told that the chief
of the LO/koala at the beginning of the dancing season distributes the
various dances among the members of the order, and that he may
redistribute them at the beginning of the following season.

It is a peculiarity of the dances of the Nootka that two masks of the
same kind always dance together.

Among the dances belonging to the LO’koala I mention the aai’Lqé
(feathers on head). He is supposed to be a being living in the woods.
The dancer wears no mask, but a head ornament of cedar bark dyed
1ed, which is the badge of the LO’koala. His badge consists of a ring
from which four feathers wound with red cedar bark rise, three over
the forehead, one in the back. The face of the dancer is smeared with
tallow and then strewn with down. The ornaments of each dancer of
the aai’Lqé, as well as of all others, must be their personal property.
They must not be loaned or borrowed. The song of the aai/Lqgé will
be found in the Appendix (p. 732).

Another dance is that of the hi/nEmix:, a fabulous bird-like being.
The dancer wears the head mask shown in Plate 48. In the top of the
mask there is a hole in which a stick is fastened, which is greased and
covered with down. When the dancer moves, the down becomes loose,
and whoever among the spectators catches a feather receives a blanket
from the chief of the Lo’koala. The song of the hi/nEmix: is given in
the Appendix (p. 732).

The A’/Lmaxko is a dance in which two men wearing two human
masks appear. The masks are called A’/Lmaxko, When they appear, the
spectators sing:

5
are eee che
Kwai-as  kwai - as A’L - max-ko

Ie., Back out, back out, A’ imaxko.

A’Lmaxko is a being living in the woods. The first to see him was a
Netcumu/asath, and ever since this sept dances the A’/Lmaxko dance.

The sa/nkk (panther) corresponds nearly to the nuLmat of the
Kwakiutl. The dancer wears a large head mask, like that of the hinE-
mix’, and a bearskin. He knocks everything to pieces, pours water
into the fire, and tears dogs to pieces and devours them. Two canine
teeth in the mouth of the mask are its most characteristic feature. A
rope is tied around his waist, by which he is led by some attendants.

The hi’Ltaq, self-torture, corresponds to the hawi/nalaL of the Kwa-
kiutl The dancers rub their bodies with the juice of certain herbs, and
push small lances through the flesh of the arms, the back, and the flanks.

Other dances are the pu’/kmis dance, in which the dancer is cov-
ered all over with pipeciay; the hu’Lmis dance—the hu’Lmis is

utensils, canoes, and other kinds of property; and dances represent-
ing a great variety of animals, particularly birds. The masks are all
much alike in type (fig. 198). Head rings made of red cedar bark are
worn in these dances.

Plate 49 shows an old bird mask and an old mask representing a
human face. They are from the west coast of Vancouver Island, and
were probably made before the beginning of this century. Plate 50

The tribes north of Barelay Sound have a dance in which the per-
former cuts long parallel gashes into his breast and arms, ‘The
ha/mats’a dance, which has been obtained by intermarriage from the
Kwakiutl, has spread as far south as Nutea‘lath. The killing of
slaves, which has been described by Sproat! and Knipping, may belong
to this part of the Lo/Koala.

Sproat describes the following events:

In December, 1864, the Seshaht Indians, then occupying their village close to
Alberni, put one of their women to a violent death. The day before they commenced

636 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

a eclebration of a peculiar character, which was to last several days, and the
murder of the woman formed, no doubt, a part of this celebration, The woman
was stabbed to death by an old man in whose house she lived, and who probably
owned her as a slave, and offered her for a victim. The body was then laid out,
without a covering, by the water side, about 150 yards from the houses. There
appeared to be no inclination to bury the body, and it was only after the chief had
been strongly remonstrated with that the poor victim’s remains were removed, after
two days’ exposure. I observed that, even after this removal, certain furious rites
took place over the very spot where the body had been exposed. The chief feature
of the celebration, apart from the murder, was a pretended attack upon the Indian
settlement by wolves, which were represented by Indians, while the rest of the
population, painted, armed, and with furious shouts, defended their houses from
attack. The horrid practice of sacrificing a victim is not annual, but only occurs
either once in three years, or else (which is more probable) at uncertain intervals;
always, however, when it does happen, the sacrifice takes place during the Klooh-
quahn-nah (L0/koala) season, which lasts from about the middle of November to
the middle of January. The Klooh-quahn-nah or Klooh-quel-lah is a great festival,
observed annually by all the Aht tribes, after their return from their fishing grounds
to the winter encampment. It is generally a time of mirth and feasting, during
which tribal rank is conferred and homage done to the chief, in a multitude of
observances which have now lost their meaning, and can not be explained by the
natives themselves. I was not aware, until this murder was committed under our
eyes, that human sacritices formed any part of the Klooh-quahn-nah celebration.
I should think it likely that old worn-out slaves are generally the victims. The
Seshaht Indians at Alberni represent the practice as most ancient, and the fact that
the other tribes of the Aht nation (about twenty in number) observe it, favors this
supposition. Their legends somewhat differ as to this practice, some saying that it
was instituted by the creator of the world; others that it arose from the sons of a
chief of former times having really been seized by wolves.!. To some extent itis a
secret institution, the young children not being acquainted with it until formally
initiated. Many of them during the horrid rite are much alarmed; the exhibition
of ferocity, the firing of guns and shouting being calculated, and probably intended,
to excite their fears. Part of a day is given up to an instruction of those children
who are to be initiated, and it is impressed upon them that the Klooh-quahn-nah
must always be kept up, or evil will happen to the tribe. The tendency, no doubt,
and probably the intention of this human sacrifice, and the whole celebration, is to
destroy the natural human feeling against murder, and to form in the people gener-
ally, and especially in the rising generation, hardened and fierce hearts. They them-
selves say that their ‘‘hearts are bad,” as long as it goes on. In the attendant cere-
monies their children are taught to look, without any sign of feeling, upon savage
preparations for war, strange dances performed in hideous masks and accompanied
by unearthly noises, and oceasionally, at least, upon the cruel destruction of human
life. Although I have no direct evidence of the fact, I believe that part of the
course of those to be initiated would be to view, howl over, and perhaps handle or
even stick their knives into the dead body of the victim, without showing any sign
of pity or of horror.

'These Indians imitate animals and birds extremely well, such as wolves or
erows. At this Klooh-quahn-nah celebration they had their hair tied out from their
heads, so as to represent a wolf’s head and snout, and the blanket was arranged
to show a tail. The motion of the wolf in running was closely imitated. More ex-
traordinary still was their acting as crows; they had a large wooden bill, and
blankets arranged so like wings that, in the dusk, the Indians really seemed like
large crows hopping about, particularly when, after the manner of these birds,
they went into the shallow water, and shook their wings and ‘‘dabbed” with their
long bills.
THE KWAKIUTL JNDIANS. 637

The following description may also refer to part of this ceremonial: !

During the song and dance, which at first seemed to present nothing peculiar, a
well-known slave (one, however, who was in a comparatively independent position,
being employed as a sailor on board the steamer Thames), suddenly ceased dancing,
and fell down on the ground, apparently in a dying state, and haying his face covered
with blood. He did not move or speak, his head fell on one side, his limbs were
drawn up, and he certainly presented a ghastly spectacle. While the dance raged
furiously around the fallen man, the doctor, with some others, seized and dragged
him to the other side of the fire round which they were dancing, placing his naked
feet very near the flames. After this a pail of water was brought in, and the
doctor, who supported the dying man on his arm, washed the blood from his face;
the people beat drums, danced, and sang, and suddenly the patient sprang to his
feet and joined in the dance, none the worse for the apparently hopeless condition
of the moment before. While all this was going on, I asked the giver of the feast
whether it was real blood upon the man’s face, and if he were really wounded. He
told me so seriously that it was, that I was at first inclined to believe him, until he
began to explain that the blood which came from the nose and mouth was owing to
the incantations of the medicine man, and that all the people would be very angry
if he did not afterwards restore him. I then recalled to mind that in the early
part of the day, before the feast, I had seen the doctor and the slave holding very
friendly conferences; and the former had used his influence to get a pass for the
latter to be present at the entertainment, to which, probably, he had no right to
come.

In Jewett’s narrative’ the following description of part of the LO‘ko-
ala occurs:

On the morning of December 13, another strange ceremony began, by the king’s
firing a pistol, apparently, without a moment’s warning, close to the ear of Satsat,
who dropped down instantly as if shot dead on the spot.

Upon this all the women set up a most terrible yelling, tearing out their hair
by handfuls, and crying out that the prince was dead, when the men rushed in,
armed with guns and daggers, inquiring into the cause of the alarm, followed by
two of the natives covered with wolf skins, with masks representing the wolf’s head.

These two came in on all fours, and taking up the prince on their back, carried
him out, retiring as they had entered. * * *

The celebration terminated with a shocking and distressing show of deliberate
self-torment.

These men, each with two bayonets run through their sides, between the ribs,
walked up and down in the room, singing war songs, and exulting in their firmness
and triumph over pain (p. 187). ary

The religious ceremonies (in another village) were concluded by 20 men who
entered the house, with arrows run through their sides and arms, having strings
fastened to them, by which the spectators twisted, or pulled them back, as the men
walked round the room, singing and boasting of their power to endure suffering
(p. 192).

Another description of the ceremonial has been given by James G.
Swan:

The Dukwally (i. e., LO’KOALA) and other tama/nawas performances are exhibitions
intended to represent incidents connected with their any theological legends. ‘There

are a great variety, and they seem to take the place, in a measure, of theatrical
performances or games during the season of the religious festivals. There are no
persons especially set apart as priests for the performance of these ceremonies,
although some, who seem more expert than others, are usually hired to give life to
the scenes, but these performers are quite as often found among the slaves or com-
mon people as among the chiefs, and excepting during the continuance of the festiv-
ities are not looked on as of any particular importance. On inquiring the origin of
these ceremonies, I was informed that they did not originate with the Indians, but
were revelations of the guardian spirits, who made known what they wished to be
performed. An Indian, for instance, who has been consulting with his guardian
spirit, which is done by going through the washing and fasting process before
described, will imagine or think he is called upon to represent the owl. He arranges
in his mind the style of dress, the number of performers, the songs and dances or other
movements, and, having the plan perfected, announces at a tama’nawas meeting that
he has had a revelation which he will impart to a select few. These are then taught
and drilled in strict secrecy, and when they have perfected themselves, will sud-
denly make their appearance and perform before the astonished tribe. Another
Indian gets up the representation of the whale, others do the same of birds, and in
fact of everything that they can think of. If any performance is a success, it is
repeated, and gradually comes to be looked upon as one of the regular order in the
ceremonies; if it does not satisfy the audience, it is laid aside. Thus they have per-
formances that have been handed down from remote ages, while others are of a more
recent date. * * ~*

The ceremony of the great Dukwally or the thunder bird originated with the
Hesh-kwi-et Indians, a band of Nittinats living near Barclay Sound, Vancouver
Island, and is ascribed to the following legend:

Two men had fallen in love with one woman, and as she would give neither the
preference, at last they came to a quarrel. But one of them, who had better sense
than the other, said: ‘Don’t let us fight about that squaw; I will go out and see
the chief of the wolves, and he will tell me what is to be done. But I can not
get to his lodge except by stratagem. Now they know we are at variance, so do you
take me by the hair, and drag me over these sharp rocks which are covered with
barnacles, and I shall bleed, and I will pretend to be dead, and the wolves will come
and carry me away to their house.” The other agreed, and dragged him over the
rocks till he was lacerated from head to foot, and then left him out of reach of the
tide. The wolves came, and, supposing him dead, carried him to the lodge of their
chief, but when they got ready to eat him, he jumped up and astonished them at his
boldness. The chief wolf was so much pleased with his bravery that he imparted to
him all the mysteries of the thunder-bird performance, and on his return home he
instructed his friends, and the Dukwally was the result. The laceration of the arms
and legs among the Makahs, during the performance to be described, is to represent
the laceration of the founder of the ceremony from being dragged over the sharp
stones.

A person intending to give one of these performances first gathers together as
much property as he can obtain, in blankets, guns, brass kettles, beads, tin pans,
and other articles intended as presents for his guests, and procures a sufficient quan-
tity of food, which of late years consists of flour, biscuit, rice, potatoes, molasses,
dried fish, and roots. He keeps his intention a secret until he is nearly ready, and
then imparts it to a few of his friends, who, if need be, assist him by adding to his
stock of presents of food. The first intimation the village has of the intended
ceremonies is on the night previous to the first day’s performance. After the com-
munity have retired for the night, which is usually between 9 and 10 o’clock, the
performers commence by hooting like owls, howling like wolves, and uttering a
sharp whistling sound intended to represent the blowing and whistling of the wind.
Guus are then fired, and all the initiated collect in the lodge where the ceremonies
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 639

are to be performed, and drum with their heels on boxes or boards, producing a
sound resembling thunder. The torches of pitch wood are flashed through the roof
of the house, and at each flash the thunder rolls, and then the whole assemblage
whistles like the wind. As soon as the noise of the performers commences, the
uninitiated fly in terror and hide themselves, so great being their superstitious
belief in the supernatural powers of the Dukwally that they have frequently fled to
my house for protection, knowing very well that the tama’nawas performers would
not come near a white man, They then visit every house in the village, and extend
an invitation for all te attend the ceremonies. This having been done, the crowd
retire to the lodge of ceremonies, where the drumming and singing are kept up till
near daylight, when they are quiet for a short time, and at sunrise begin again.
The first five days are usually devoted to secret ceremonies, such as initiating can-
didates, and a variety of performances, which consist chiefly in songs and chorus
and drumming to imitate thunder. They do this part very well, and their imitation
of thunder is quite equal to that produced in the best equipped theatre.

What the ceremony of initiation is I have never learned. That of the Clallams,
which I have witnessed, consists in putting the initiates into a mesmeric sleep; butif
the Makahs use mesmerism, or any such influence, they do not keep the candidates
under it for any great length of time, as I saw them every day during the cere-
monies, walking out during the intervals. The first outdoor performance usually
commences on the fifth day, and this consists of the procession of males and females,
with their Jegs and arms, and sometimes their bodies, scarified with knives, and
every wound bleeding freely. The men are entirely naked, but the women have
on a short petticoat. * * * [The wounds are made as follows:] A bucket of
water was placed in the center of the lodge, and the candidates squatting around it
washed their arms and legs. The persons who did the cutting, and who appeared
to be any one who had sharp knives, butcher knives being preferred, yrasped them
firmly in the right hand with the thumb) placed along the blade, so as to leave but
an eighth or quarter of an inch of the edge bare; then, taking hold of the arm or
leg of the candidate, made gashes 5 or 6 inches long transversally, and parallel with
the limb, four or five gashes being cut each way. Cuts were thus made on each
arm above and below the elbow, on each thigh, and the calves of the legs; some,
but not all, were likewise cut on their backs. The wounds were then washed with
water to make the blood run freely. * * * When all was ready, the procession
left the lodge and marched in single file down to the beach, their naked bodies
streaming with blood, presenting a barbarous spectacle. A circle was formed at the
water’s edge, round which this bloody procession marched slowly, making gesticula-
tions and uttering howling cries.

Five men now came out of the lodge carrying the principal performer. One held
him by the hair, and the others by the arms and legs. He, too, was cut and bleeding
profusely. ‘They laid him down on the beach on the wet sand, and left him, while
they marched off and visited every lodge in the village, making a cireuit in each
lodge. At last the man on the beach jumped up, and seizing a club laid about
him in a violent manner, hitting everything in his way. He, too, went the same
round as the ethers, and after every lodge had been visited, they all returned to the
lodge from which they had issued, and the performances outdoor were closed for
that day. In the meanwhile a deputation of fifteen or twenty men, with faces
painted black and sprigs of evergreen in their hair, had been sent to the other villages
with invitations for guests to come and receive presents. They went in a body te
each lodge, and after a song and a chorus the spokesman of the party, in a loud
voice, announced the object of their visit, and called the names of the invited per-
sons. Anyone has a right to be present at the distribution, but only those specially
invited wilk receive any presents.

Every evening during the ceremonies, excepting those of the first few days, is
devoted to masquerade and other amusements, when each lodge is visited and a
640 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.
performance enacted. * * * The masks are made principally by the Clyoquot
and Nittinat Indians, and sold to the Makahs, who paint them to suit their own
fancies. They are mado of alder, maple, and cottonwood; some are very ingeniously
executed, having the eyes and lower jaw movable. By means of a string the per-
former can make the eyes roll about, and the jaws gnash together with a fearful
clatter. As these masks are kept strictly concealed until the time of the perform-
ances, and as they are generally produced at night, they are viewed with awe by the
spectators; and certainly the scene in one of these lodges, dimly lighted by the fires
which show the faces of the assembled spectators and illuminate the perforniers,
presents a most weird and savage spectacle when the masked dancers issue forth
from behind a screen of mats, and go through their barbarous pantomimes. The
Indians themselves, even accustomed as they are to these masks, feel very much
afraid of them, and a white man, viewing the scene for the first time, can only liken
it to a carnival of demons.

Among the masquerade performances that I have seen was a representation of
mice, This was performed by a dozen or more young men who were entirely
naked. Their bodies, limbs, and faces were painted with stripes of red, blue, and
black; red bark wreaths were twisted around their heads, and bows and arrows in
their hands. They made a squealing noise, but otherwise they did nothing that
reminded me of mice in the least. Another party was composed of naked boys,
with bark fringes, like veils, covering their faces, and armed with sticks having
needles in oneend; they made a buzzing noise and stuck the needles into any of the
spectators who came in their way. This was a representation of hornets. These
processions followed each other at an interval of half an hour,and exch made a
cireuit round the jodge, performed some antics, sang some songs, shouted, and left.
Another party then came in, composed of men with frightful masks, bearskins on
their backs, and heads covered with down. They had clubs in their hands, and as
they danced around a big fire blazing in the center of the lodge, they struck wildly
with them, caring little whom or what they hit. One of their number was naked,
with a rope round his waist, a knife in each hand, and making a fearful howling.
Two others had hold of the end of the rope, as if to keep him from doing any harm.
This was the most ferocious exhibition I had seen, and the spectators got out of
their reach as far as they could. They did no harm, however, excepting that one
with his club knocked ahole through a brass kettle; after which they left and went
to the other lodges, where I learned that they smashed boxes and did much mischief.
After they had gone, the owner examined his kettle, and quaintly remarked that it
was worth more to him than the pleasure he had experienced by their visit, and he
should look to the man who broke it for remuneration.

On a subsequent evening I was present at another performance. ‘This consisted of
dancing, jumping, firing of guns, ete. <A large fire was first built in the center of
the lodge, and the performers, with painted faces, and many with masks resembling
owls, wolves, and bears, crouched down with their arms clasped about their knees,
their blankets trailing on the ground and fastened around the neck with a single
pin. After forming in a circle with their faces toward the fire, they commenced
jumping sideways round the blaze, their arms still about their knees. In this man-
ner they whirled around for several minutes, producing a most remarkable appear-
ance. These performers, who were male, were succeeded by some thirty women with
blackened faces, their heads covered with down, and a girdle around their blankets,
drawing them in tight at the waist. These danced around the fire with a shuffling,
ungainly gait, singing a song as loud as they could screamin, which was accompanied
by everyone in the lodge, and beating time with sticks on boards placed before them
for the purpose. When the dance was over, some five or six men, with wreaths of
seaweed around their heads, blackened faces, and bearskins over their shoulders,
rushed in and fired a volley of musketry through the roof. One of them then made a
speech, the purport of which was that the ceremonies had progressed favorably thus
far; that their hearts had become strong, and that they felt ready to attack their
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 641

enemies or to repel any attack upon themselves. Their guns having in the mean-
while been loaded, another volley was fired, and the whole assembly uttered a shout
to signify approval. The performances during the daytime consisted of repre-
sentations on the beach of various kinds. There was one representing a whaling
scene. AnIndian on all fours, covered with a bearskin, imitated the motion of a
whale while blowing. He was followed by a party of eight men armed with har-
poons and lances, and carrying all the implements of whaling. Two boys, naked,
with bodies rubbed over with flour, and white cloths around their heads, represented
cold weather; others represented cranes moving slowly at the water’s edge and
occasionally dipping their heads down as if seizing a fish. They wore masks resem-
bling a bird’s beak, and bunches of eagles’ feathers stuck in their hair. During all of
these scenes the spectators kept up a continual singing and drumming. Every day
during these performances feasts were given at different lodges to those Indians who
had come from the other villages, at which great quantities of food were eaten and
many cords of wood burned, the giver of the feast being very prodigal of his winter’s
supply of food and fuel. The latter, however, is procured quite easily from the for-
est, and only causes a little extra labor*to obtain a sufficiency.

The final exhibition of the ceremonies was the T’hlukloots representation, after
which the presents were distributed. Fvom daylight in the morning till about 11
o’clock in the forenoon was occupied by indoor performances, consisting of singing
and drumming, and occasional speeches. When these were over, some twenty per-
formers, dressed up in masks and feathers, some with naked bodies, others covered
with bearskins, and accompanied by the whole assembly, went down on the beach
and danced and howled in the most frightful manner. After making as much uproar
as they could, they returned to the lodge, and shortly after every one mounted on
the roofs of the houses to see the performance of the T’hlikloots. First, a young
girl came out upon the roof of a lodge, wearing a mask representing the head of the
thunderbird, which was surmounted by a topknot of cedar bark dyed red and stuck
full of white feathers from eagles’ tails. Over her shoulders she wore a red blanket
covered with a profusion of white buttons, brass thimbles, and blue beads; her hair
hung down her back, covered with white down. The upper half of her face was
painted black, and the lower red. Another girl, with a similar headdress, was naked
except a skirt about her hips. Her arms and legs had rings of blue beads, and she
wore bracelets of brass wire around her wrists; her face being painted like the
other. Asmaller girl had a black mask to resemble the ha-he’k-to-ak. The masks did
not cover the face, but were on the forehead, from which they projected like horns.
The last girl’s face was also painted black and red. I'rom her ears hung large orna-
ments made of the haikwa or dentalium, and blue and red beads, and around her neck
was an immense necklace of blue beads. Her skirt was also covered with strings of
beads, giving her quite a picturesque appearance. A little boy, with a black mask
and headband of red bark, the ends of which hung down over his shoulders, and
eagles’ feathers in a topknot, was the remaining performer. They moved around in
a slow and stately manner, occasionally spreading out their arms to represent flying,
and uttering a sound to imitate thunder, but which resembled the noise made by
the nighthawk when swooping for its prey, the spectators meanwhile beating drums,
pounding the roofs with sticks, and rattling with shells. This show lasted half an
hour, when all again went into the lodge to witness the distribution of presents and
the grand finale. The company all being arranged, the performers at one end of the
lodge and the women, children, and spectators at the other, they commenced by
putting out the fires and removing the brands and cinders. <A quantity of feathers
were strewed over the ground floor of the lodge, and a dance and song commenced,
every one joining in the latter, each seeming to try to make as much noise as possible.
A large box, suspended by a rope from the roof, served as a bass drum, and other
drums were improvised from the brass and sheet-iron kettles and tin pans belonging
to the domestic furniture of the house, while those who had no kettles, pans, or
boxes banged with their clubs on the roof and sides of the house till the noise was

NAT MUS 95 41

642 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

almost deafening. In this uproar there was a pause; then the din commenced anew.
This time the dancers brought out blankets, and with them beat the feathers on the
floor till the whole air was filled with down, like flakes of snow during a heavy
winter’s storm. Another lull succeeded, then another dance, and another shaking
up of feathers, till I was half choked with dust and down. Next the presents were
distributed, consisting of blankets, guns, shirts, beads, and a variety of trinkets,
and the whole affair wound up with a feast.

I presume the following custom belongs here as well. When the
incantations and practices of the shaman are of no avail, the patient is
initiated in a secret society called tsa/yéq. Hvidently this name is
derived from the Kwakiutl word ts’a’eqa, thus suggesting that this cere-
mony also was borrowed from the win-
ter ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. I
obtained the following description of
these ceremonies: The members of the

When dancing, they hold the first
fingers of both hands up, trembling
violently. They enter all houses and
take the patients and all the other peo-
ple who desire to become members of
the tsa‘yéq along, two members of the
society taking each novice between

and all those who desire to become members of the society join the
procession. The circuit finished, they assemble in a house in which
during the following days none but members of the tsa’yeq are
allowed. They sing and dance for four days. After these days the
novice obtains his cedar bark ornament (fig. 199 and Plate 51). Small
carvings representing the crest of his sept are attached to the front
part of the head ring. The dress of the ucta/qyu, the shaman, who is
the most important member of the society, is larger than that of the
other members.

Swan! has described the ceremony as follows:

The other performance is termed Tsiahk, and is a medicine performance, quite as
interesting, but not as savage in its detail. It is only occasionally performed, when
some person, either a chief or a member of his family, is sick. The Makahs believe
in the existence of a supernatural being, who is represented to be an Indian of a
dwartfish size, with long hair of a yellowish color flowing down his back and cover-
ing his shoulders. From his head grow four perpendicular horns, two at the temple
and two back of the ears. When people are sick of any chronic complaint and much
debilitated, they imagine they see this being in the night, who promises relief if the
ceremonies he prescribes are well performed. The principal performer is a doctor,
whose duties are to manipulate the patient, who is first initiated by secret rites into
the mysteries of the ceremony. What these secret rites consist of I have not ascer-
tained, but there is a continual singing and drumming during the day and evening
for three days before spectators are admitted. Irom the haggard and feeble appear-
ance of some patients I have seen, I judge the ordeal must have been severe. The
peculiarity of this ceremony consists in the dress worn alike by patients, novitiates,
and performers. Both men and women assist, but the proportion of females is greater
than of males. On the head of the female performer is worn a sort of coronet made
of bark, surmounted by four upright bunches or little pillars made of bark wound
round with the same material, and sometimes threads from red blankets, to give a
variety of color. |*rom the top of each of the four pillars, which represent the horns
of the tsiahk, are bunches of eagles’ quills, which have been notched and one side
of the feather edge stripped off. In front is a band which is variously decorated,
according to the taste of the wearer, with beads, brass buttons, or any trinkets they
may have. From each side of this band project bunches of quills similar to those
on the top of thehead. The long hair of the tsiahk is represented by a heavy and thick
fringe of bark, which covers the back and shoulders to the elbow. Necklaces com-
posed of a great many strings of beads of all sizes and colors, and strung in various
forms, are also worn, and serve to add to the effect of the costume. The paint for the
face is red for the forehead and for the lower part, from the root of the nose to the ears;
the portion between the forehead and the lower part is black, with two or three red
marks on each cheek. The dress of the novitiate females is similar, with the excep-
tion of there being no feathers or ornaments on the bark headdress, and with the
addition of black or blue stripes on the red paint covering the forehead and lower
portion of the face. The headdress of the men consists of a circular band of bark
and colored worsted, from the back part of which are two bunches of bark, like
horses’ tails. Two upright sticks are fastened to the band behind the ears, and
on top of these ‘sticks are two white feathers tipped with red; the quill portion is
inserted into a piece of elder stick with the pith extracted and then put on the band
sticks. These sockets give the feathers the charm of vibrating as the wearer moves
his head; when dancing or moving in procession, the hands are raised as high as the
face and the fingers spread out.

The doctor or principal performer has on his head a dress of plain bark similar to
the female novitiate. He is naked except a piece of blanket about his loins, and
his body is covered with stripes of red paint. The outdoor performance consists of
a procession which moves from the lodge to the beach; the principal actor or con-
ductor being at the head, followed by all the males in single file, the last one being
the doctor. Immediately behind the doctor the patient follows, supported on each
side by a female assistant. The females close up the procession. All parties, male
and female, have their hands raised as high as their faces, and the motion of the
procession is a sort of shuffling dance. They move in a circle which gradually closes
around the patient, who, with the novitiate, is left seated on the ground in the cen-
tre; songs with choruses by the whole of the spectators, drumming, shaking rattles,
and firing of guns wind up the performance, and all retire to the lodge, where

dancing and singing are kept up for several days. Finally, presents are distributed,
a feast is held, and the friends retire. The patient and novitiates are obliged to
wear their dress for one month. It consists of the bark headdress, having instead
of feathers, two thin strips of wood, feather-shaped, but differently painted. Those
of the patient are red at each end and white in the center, with narrow transverso
bars of blue. Those of the novitiate have blue ends and the center unpainted.
The patient’s face is painted red, with perpendicular marks of blue on the forehead
and the lower part of the face. The novitiate’s forehead and lower portion of face
is painted with alternate stripes of red and blue, the remainder of the face blue; the
head band is also wound with blue yarn and yellow bark. The head band of the
patient iswoeund with red. The tails of bark of both headdresses are dyed red. The
patient carries in his hand a staff which can be used as a support while walking; this
has red bark tied at each end and around the middle.

The Dukwally and Tsiahk are the performances more frequently exhibited among
the Makahs than any others, although they have several different ones. The ancient
tama‘nawas is termed Do-t’hlub or Do-t’hlum,! and was formerly the favorite one.
But after they had learned the T’hulkoots, or Thunder bird, they laid aside the
Do-t’hlub, as its performance, from the great number of ceremonies, was attended
with too much trouble and expense. The origin of the Do-t’hlub was, as stated to
me by the Indians, in this manner: Many years ago an Indian, while fishing in deep
water for codfish, hauled up on his hook an immense haliotis shell. He had scarcely
got it into his canoe when he fell into a trance, which lasted a few minutes, and on
his recovery he commenced paddling home, but before reaching land he had several
of these trances, and on reaching the shore his friends took him up for dead, and
carried him into his house, where he presently recovered, and stated that while in
the state of stupor he had a vision of Do-t’hlub, one of their mythological beings,
and that he must be dressed as Do-t’hlub was and then he would have revelations.
He described the appearance, as he saw it in his vision, in which Do-t’hlub pre-
sented himself with hands like deer’s feet. He was naked to his hips, around which
was a petticoat of cedar bark dyed red, which reached to his knees. His body and
arms were red; his face painted red and black; his hair tied up in bunches with
cedar twigs, and cedar twigs reaching down his back. When his friends had dressed
him according to his direction, he fell into another trance, in which he saw the
dances which were to be performed, heard the songs which were to be sung, and
learned all the secret ceremonies to be observed. It was also revealed that each
performer must have a piece of the haliotis shell in his nose, and pieces in his ears.
He taught the rites to certain of his friends, and then performed before the tribe,
who were so well pleased that they adopted the ceremony as their tama’nawas, and
retained its observance for many years, till it was superseded by the Dukwally.
The haliotis shell worn by the Makahs in their noses is a custom originating from
the Do-t’?hlub. Other ceremonies are occasionally gone through with, but the
description above given will serve to illustrate all those observed by the Makahs.
Different tribes have some peculiar to themselves, the general character of which is,
however, the same. It will be seen that the public part of these performances are
rather in the nature cf amusements akin to our theatrical pantomimes than of
religious observances, though they are religiously observed.

THE LKU/NGEN.

My information on the ceremonials of the Coast Salish is very mea-
ger. 1 obtained the following information from the Lku/ngkEn, the
tribe which occupies the territory near Victoria, British Columbia.
They have two secret societies, the teyiyi/wan and the xEnxani‘tEl
(dog howlers).

! This is clearly the Kwakiutl word no/nLEm.

THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 645

Any member of the tribe may join the teyiyi’wan. When desiring
to do so, he retires into the woods and Stays there for some time, bath-
ing in ponds and washing his body with cedar branches. The intend-
ing novice is called xausa/lokut. Finally he dreams of the dance
which he will perform and the song which he will sing. In his dream
his soul is led all over the world by the spirit who gives him his dance
and his song. Then he returns to the village. According to what he
has dreamed, he belongs to one of five societies which constitute the
teyiyil’/wan: (1) The sqé@/iep, who dance with elbows pressed close to
the body, the arms extended forward and moving up and down; (2)
the nuxsoa/weqa, who jump about in wild movements; (3) the sqii/qoaL,
who dance in slow movements; (4) the sqdie/lec, whose dance is said to
be similar to that of the sqé@/iep, and (5) the teilqtE/NEN (derived from
tea‘log woods). The general name of the dances of the teyiyi’/wan is
me‘iLa, which word is borrowed from the Kwakiutl. When the novice |
returns from the woods, he teaches for two days his song to the mem-
bers of the society to which he is to belong. Then the dance is per-
formed and henceforth he is a regular member of the society.

The xmnxani‘tEl, the second society, are also called Lo’koala and
noNLEM, although the first name is the proper Lku/igEn term. The
Lku’/ngEn state that they obtained the secrets of this society from the
Nootka, and this is undoubtedly true. It appears that the secrets of
these societies spread from the Nootka to the Lku/ngkEn, Clallam, and
the tribes of Puget Sound. The Tc’a/tELp, a sept of the Sanitch tribe,
also have the no/nLEm, while the Snanai/muX, the Cowichan, and the
tribes of Fraser River have hardly a trace of it. The Comox and Pent-
latch obtained it through intermarriage with both the Kwakiutl and the
Nootka.

The right to perform the no‘nLEm is jealously guarded by all tribes
who possess it, and many a war has been waged against tribes who

-illegitimately performed the ceremonies of the society. Its mysteries
were kept a profound secret, and if’ a man dared to speak about it he
was torn to pieces by the quqq’é/IEn, about whom I shall speak pres-
ently. Only rich people can become members of the XEnxani’tEl, as
heavy payments are exacted at the initiation. If the father of the
novice is not able to pay them, his relatives must contribute to the
amount required. The initiation and the festivals of this society
take place in winter only. When a young man is to be initiated, his
father first invites the xEnxani’tEl to a feast, which lasts five days.
During these days mask dances are performed, which those who are not
members of the society are also permitted to witness. They occupy
one side of the house in which the festivities take place, while the
XEnxant’tEl occupy the other. The latter wear head ornaments of cedar
bark and have their hair strewn with down. The faces of all those
who take part in the festival are blackened. At the end of three days
the father of the novice invites four men to bathe his son in the sea.
646 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

One of them must wash his body, one must wash his head, and the
two others hold him. In return they receive one or two blankets each.
During this ceremony the quqq’é/lEn, who are described as wild men,
dance around the novice. They have ropes tied around their waists,
and are held by other members of the society by these ropes. Then
the xEnxani’tEl lead the novice into the woods, where he remains for a
long time, until he meets the spirit that initiates him. It seems that
during this time he is secretly led to the house in which the xEnxani’tEl
continue to celebrate festivals at the expense of the novice’s father,
and there he is taught the secrets of the society. During this time,
until the return of the novice from the woods, the house is tabooed.
A watchman is stationed at the entrance, who keeps out uninitiated
persons. During the absence of the novice, his mother prepares cedar
bark ornaments and weaves mountain goat blankets for his use. One
afternoon he returns, and then his father gives a feast to let the people
know that his child has returned. The latter performs his first dance,
in which he uses masks and cedar bark ornaments. This dance is
called nuxnEi/mEn. On this day the father must distribute a great
number of blankets among the xEnxani’t#l. The initiated are per-
mitted to take part in the feast, and sit on one side of the house. The
new member spends all his nights in the woods, where he bathes. In
the spring the new member, if a man, is thrown into the sea, and after
that is free from all regulations attending the initiation. One of the
principal regulations regarding novices of the xEnxani’tEl is that they
must return from the woods in the direction in which the sun is mov-
ing, starting so that the sun is at their backs. Therefore they must
sometimes go in roundabout ways. They must go backward through
doors, which are sLa/IEqam (supernatural) against them. Frequently
the sio/ua (a female shaman) is called to bespeak the door in their
behalf before they pass through it. Before their dance the si0’/ua must
also address the earth, as it is supposed that else it might open and
swallow up the dancer. It is also sLa‘/Eqam against the novice. The
expression used is that the earth would “open its eyes” (k’u‘nalasEn) ;
that means, swallow the novice. In order to avert this danger, the
sid/ua must ‘give a name to the earth,” and strew red paint and feathers
over the place where the novice is to dance.

THE BI’LXULA.

The social organization, festivals, and secret societies of the Bi/lxula
are still more closely interrelated than they are among the Kwakiutl,
and must be considered in connection. We have to describe here the
potlatch, the sisau’k:, and the ki/siut. The sisau’k: corresponds to
the Laolaxa of the northern Kwakiutl tribes, the ku’siut to the
ts’é/ts’aéqa. The Bi/lxula believe that the potlatch has been insti-
tuted by ten deities, nine brothers and one sister, the foremost among
whom is Xé/mtsioa, to whose care the sunrise is intrusted. He resides
with the others in a beautiful house in the far east, and cries ‘0, 0,”
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 647

every morning when the sun rises. He takes care that he rises prop-
erly. The first six of these deities are grouped in pairs, and are
believed to paint their faces with designs representing moon, stars,
and rainbow. In the ku/siut these deities make their appearance, and
are represented by masks. Xé/mtsioa and Xemxemala‘oLa wear the
design of the full moon, indicated on the mask of Xé/mtsioa by a
double curved line in red and black, the black outside, passing over
forehead, cheeks, and upper lip. Xemxemala/ota has a double curved
line in red and black, the red outside, which passes over forehead,
cheeks, and chin. Aiumki‘lik-a and Aiumali/oLa wear the design of
the crescent, drawn in red and black, with differences similar to those
between the first and second masks. The fifth Q’omq’omki‘lik-a and
Q’o/mtsioa have designs representing stars, both wearing the same
style of mask. The seventh is Qula’/xawa, whose face represents the
blossom of a salmon-berry bush. The next in order, Kule‘lias (who
wants to have blankets first), wears the design of the rainbow in
black and blue. The ninth, A?ama’k, wears on the head a mask repre-
senting a kingfisher, and is clothed in a bird-skin blanket. The last
of the series is a woman called L’étsa/apleLana (the eater), the sister of
the others. Her face is painted with the design of a bladder filled with
grease. She figures in several legends as stealing provisions and pur-
sued by the people wkom she has robbed.

The sisau’/k-, which is danced at potlatches and other festivals of
the clans, is presided over by a being that lives in the sun. A man who
had gone out hunting met the sisau’k: and was instructed by him in the
secrets of the dance. When he returned, he asked the people to clean
their houses and to strew them with clean sand before he consented to
enter. Then he danced the sisau’k: and told the people what he had
seen. He said that the being had commanded them to perform this
dance and to adorn themselves when dancing with carved headdresses
with trails of ermine skins, and to swing carved rattles. The man,
later on, returned to the sun. Tver since that time the Bi/lxula dance
the sisau/k:. Besides this, it is stated that the raven gave each clan its
secrets. Each clan has its peculiar carvings, which are used in the
sisau/k* only, and are otherwise kept a profound secret, i. e., they are
the sacred possessions of each clan. All clans, however, wear the beau-
tiful carved headdresses and use the raven rattles, regardless of the
carving they represent. Every time the sacred objects of a clan are
shown to the people a potlatch is given. The sacred objects, although
the property of the various clans, must nevertheless be acquired by
each individual—that is to say, every free person has the right to
acquire a certain group of carvings and names, according to the clan
to which he or she belongs. Slaves and slaves’ children, also illegiti-
mate children, can not become sisau‘/k-. A person can not take a
new carving, but must wait until it is given to him by his relatives—
father, mother, or elder brother. Nusk’kElu’sta, the Indian, to whom I
648 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

owe my information regarding the clans, and who is a member of the
gens Ial6/stimot of the Talié’mx-, stated that he had received the raven
when he gave his first potlatch. At his second potlatch he received
the eagle. He hoped that his mother would give him the whale at his
next potlatch, and would at the same time divulge to him the secrets con-
nected with it. In course of time, he said, he might get even others
from his brother; but if the latter’s children should prove to be very
good, and develop very rapidly, his brother would probably give his
secrets to hisown children. At festivals, when a person acquires a new
secret, he changes his name. Each person has two names, a ku’siut
name, which remains through life, and a Xe/mtsioa name, which is
changed at these festivals. Thus, Nusk’klu’sta’s (which is his ku‘siut
name) Xé@/mtsioa name was AL/iLEmMnE‘lus’aix:, but at his next pot-
latch he intended to take the name of Kalia/kis. These names are
also the property of the various clans, each clan having its own names.
When a man possesses several sisau’k: secrets, he will distribute them
among his children. When a girl marries, her father or mother may,
after a child has been born to her, give one or several of their sisau’k:
secrets to her husband, as his children make him a member of her clan.
When a person grows old, he gives away all his sisau’k: secrets. After
any secret has been given away the giver must not use it any more.
The crest and the sisau’k: carvings must not be loaned to others,
but each person must keep his own carvings. The only exceptions are
the carved headdresses and the raven rattles, which are not the
property of any particular clan.

The laws regarding the potlatch are similar to those of the Kwakiutl.
The receiver of a present becomes the debtor of the person who gave
the potlatch. If the latter should die, the debts become due to his
heirs. If the debtor should die, his heirs become responsible for the
debt. Property is also destroyed at potlatches. This is not returned,
and serves only to enhance the social position of the individual who
performed this act. It is not necessary that all the property given by
a person in a potlatch should be owned by him. He may borrow part
of it from his friends, and has to repay it with interest. I was told,
for instance, that a man borrowed a large copper plate and burnt it ata
potlateh. When doing so, he had to name the price which he was going
to pay the owner in its stead. Since that feast he died, and his heirs
are now respousible for the amount named at the potlatch.

The kt’siut is presided over by a female spirit, called Anaulikuts’-
ai’x. Her abode is a cave in the woods, which she keeps shut from
February till October, remaining all the while inside. In October she
opens the door of her cave and sits in front of it. A woman is said to
have been the first to find her. Anaitlikuts’ai’x: invited her into her
cave and taught her the secrets of the ku’siut. She wore ornaments
of red cedar bark around her head, waist, and ankles; her face was
blackened, her hair strewn with eagle down. She commanded the
THER KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 649

woman to dance in the same way as she saw her dancing. The people
should accompany her dance with songs, and, after she had finished,
they should dance with masks. She said, ‘‘ Whenever a person sees
me, your people shall dance the ku’siut. If you do not do so, I shall
punish you with death and sickness. In summer, while I am in my
house, you must not dance the ku/siut.”

Ever since that time the Bi/Ixula dance the ki’siut. When a man
has seen Anatlikuts’ai’x: sitting in front of her cave, he will invite the
people toa ki’siut. A ring made of red and white cedar bark is hung
up in his house, and the uninitiated are not allowed to enter it. Only
in the evening, when dances are performed, they may look on, standing
close to the door. As soon as the dances are over, they must retire
from the taboo house. Each ku/siut lasts three days.

The various dances performed by members of the kii’siut are also
property of the clans, and the right to perform them is restricted to
members of the clan. They must not be given to a daughter’s hus-
band, as is the case with the sisau’k: dances, but belong to the mem-
bers of the clan, who have a right to a particular dance, but who do
not own it. Permission to use a mask or dance is obtained from the
owner by payments. The owner may reclaim the dance or the borrower
may return it at any time. Membership of the kwt’siut is obtained
through an initiation. At this time the novice is given his ki/siut
name, which is inherited by young persons from their parents or from
other relatives. Thus a young man who had the name of Po’po until
he was about seventeen years old, obtained at his initiation the name
of Wako/oL. I have not reached a very clear understanding of the
details of the initiation; it seems that the dance is simply given to the
novice in the same way as the sisau’k-, this initiation being connected
with a potlatch. But still it seems possible that he must ‘‘dream” of the
dance which he is to perform. Only the highest degrees of the ku’siut
have to pass through a religious ceremony of some importance. The
highest degrees are the Elaxo’La (the ha/mats’a of the Kwakiutl), the
01Ex (the nu’/LmatL of the Kwakiutl), and the da‘tia (the no/ntsistalaL
of the Kwakiutl). These grades are also hereditary. A ki’siut novice
may acquire them at once at his first initiation.

When the Elaxo’La is initiated, he goes into the forest, where he
encounters his guardian spirit. It is believed that he goes up to the
sun, and formerly he had to take human flesh along for food. The
chiefs held a council the night preceding the beginning of the cere-
monies, and anyone who wanted to show his liberality offered one of
his slaves to be killed in order to serve as food for the Elaxo’/La. The
offer was accepted, and a payment of from ten to twenty blankets was
made for the slave. The latter was killed, and the members of the
Elax0/La order devoured one-half of the body before the departure of
the novice to the woods. There the latter was tied up and left to fast.
He may stay there for twenty or thirty days until the spirit appears

to him and takes him up to the sun, where he is initiated. Early one
morning he returns, and is heard outside the houses. He has lost all
his hair, which, it is believed, has been torn out by the strong breeze
blowing in the higher regions. He is quite naked, and bites everyone
whom he can lay hold of. If he can not catch anyone he will bite his
own arm. It is believed that he has lost his soul, which fled from the
body when the spirit came to him. Therefore the shamans must try
for four days to recapture his soul. The night after they have recoy-
ered it the Elax0/La dances, clothed in a bearskin and wearing a large
head ring, heavy bracelets and anklets, all made of red cedar bark.
Sometimes he appears wearing the mask of the S’a/Lpsta (fig. 200),
the spirit which initiated him. This mask corresponds exactly to that
of BaxbakualanuXsi/wae of the Kwakiutl. Some Elax0’La do not
bite people, but merely
devour raw salmon or
tear dogs to pieces and
devourthem. Those who
bite people will also
devour corpses. The
Elaxo’La has to observe
a number of regulations.
For four years after his
initiation he must not
gamble. He must stay away from his wife for one
year, but this period is being reduced to one month.
For two or three months he must not leave his house.

The 0/leEx (the laugher) and the da‘tia (the thrower)
do not go into the woods to be initiated, but both
must fast three days before their first dance. The
o‘TeEx “‘makes fun of everything” and scratches peo-

it at night when he dances. The 0’lEx and the da’‘tia,
after they have danced, must stay in their houses for one month.

If a person transgresses the laws of the ku’siut, for instance, when
the Elax0’/La gambles, or when a man performs a dance to which he
has no right, also when a person derides the ceremonies or makes a
mistake in dancing, his punishment is death. The chiefs assemble in
council and the offender is called before the court. After his offense
has been proved, he is asked whether he is willing to suffer the penalty
of death. If he is not willing and one of his relatives is found willing
to take the penalty on himself, the guilty party is spared and the sub-
stitute killed in his stead. The execution of the judgment is intrusted
to the shaman, who bewitches the condemned person by throwing dis-
ease into him or by poisoning him in some other (supernatural?) way.
The object thrown by the shaman is a shell, bone, or finger nail, around

the middle of which objects a human hair is tied. If this object
strikes the offender, he will fall sick. Blood is believed to collect in
his stomach, and if it so happens that he vomits this blood, and with
it the disease-producing object, he will recover, and is not molested
any further. The masks (not the whistles and other ornaments) used
in the ku/siut are burnt immediately at the close of each dancing sea-
son. Novices must wear a necklace of red
cedar bark over their blankets for a whole
year. The masks used in the dances repre-
sent mythical personages, and the dances are
pantomimic representations of myths. Among
others, the thunder bird and his servant,
ALxula/tEnum (who wears a mask with red
and blue stripes over the whole face from the
right-hand upper side to the left-hand lower
side, and carries a staff with red and blue
spiral lines), appear in the dances. Prominent
masks are also Xe/mtsioa and his brothers
and his sisters; Masmasala‘/nix and his fel-
lows, the raven and the nusxé’mta, and many
others.!

THE TSIMSHIAN, NISQA’, HAIDA, AND
TLINGIT.

The tribes of this group learned the ceremo.
nial avowedly from the He/iltsuq. Although
I have not witnessed any part of their ceremo-
nials, the descriptions which I received bring
out with sufficient clearness its similarities to
the winter ceremonial of the Kwakiutl. The
ceremonials seem to be almost identical among
all these tribes. It ismost complete among the
southwestern Tsimshian tribes, particularly ASL 8 ee

tribes of the coast. It is said that it reached cat. No. ss0s, U.S. N.M. Collected by
the Haida not more than a hundred years ago. pee

I will tell here what I learned from the Nisqa’. They have six
societies, which rank in the following order: The sEmhalai’/t, mé@iLa’,
1OLE’m, Olala’, naneésta’t, honana/L, the last being the highest. The
sEmhaiai‘t is really not confined to the winter ceremonial, but is
obtained when a person acquires the first guardian spirit of his clan
and performs the ceremony belonging to this event. The tradition of
the origin of these ceremonies localizes the events at Bellabella, and it

Fig. 201.

'See “Indianische Sagen von der Nord—Pacifischen Kiiste Amerikas,”’ page 241, by
F. Boas.
652 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

is added that the G-itxa’La, after having acquired the ceremonial from
the He’iltsuq, transmitted it to the Nisqa’. This report is corroborated
by linguistic evidence. All the names of the societies, with the sole
exception of the first, are of Kwakiutl derivation. (meiLa’/, teasing;
1OLE’‘m, Kwakiutl no‘LEm; Oolala‘, name of a Kwakiutl dance;
nanesta’t, Kwakiutl nontsista/laL; honana’,
dance of ——). The cry of the lala’,
“hap,” is also a Kwakiutl word meaning
eating, and is the same as the cry of the
ha/‘mats’a. The original tradition mentions
three societies only—the second, third, and
fourth. This shows that the first one is not
a secret society, properly speaking, and that
the fifth and sixth are later importations.
The Nisqa’ state that with the ceremonies
came the use of large whistles. I will give
the Nisqa/ tradition of the origin of the secret
societies:

Olala’ crying “hap,” and he fainted. Then his om
soul was taken into the house. In the rear of
the house he saw a large room partitioned off.
The partition was hung with red cedar bark.
It was the secret room of the odlala’. To the
right of the door, on entering, was a secret room
for the méiLa’, and to the left of the door one
for the 1lOLE’m. The chief, who was sitting in
the rear of the house, ordered a fire to be made,

a ring of the same material on his head, and wore a bearskin. He
said: “You must use the same ornaments when you return to your
people.” He took a whistle out of his own mouth and gave it to
Sagaitla’/bEn. He gave him his small neck ring of cedar bark, which
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 653

instilled into him the desire of devouring men (therefore it is called
q’atsx Em ]ox:, cedar bark throat), and he gave him large cedar bark
rings and a small bearskin, which enabled him to fly. He told him:
“You shall kill men, you shall eat them, and carry them to my house.”
And he opened the door. The singers sang and beat time, and Sagait-
la’/bEn flew away. He flew from town to town over the whole world,
erying “hap” all the time. He went from
the country of the Wutsda’ to Skeena
River, and then to Nass River. Some-
times he was seen on high cliffs. He
killed and devoured people whom he
found in the woods.

After three years he was seen near the
village of theG-itfama/t. They attempted
to catch him. They killed dogs and
threw them into a hole, and a number of
Shamans hid under a canoe near by.
Soon he was heard to approach. He
alighted on the top of a dry cedar. He
lay there on his stomach, and. the point of
the tree was seen to penetrate his body
and to pierce it. But it did not kill him.
When he saw the dead dogs, he flew
down, and after he had eaten, the sha-
mans rushed up to him, caught him, and
took him up to the house. They tried to
cure him, and the people sang Olala/ songs
(all of which have a five-part rhythm).
He tried to fly again, but was unable to
get out of the house. Finally he was
tamed and became like other men. Then

back by the help of their spirits. In order to do this, they dance w th
the head ornaments of their clans, their rattles, dancing blankets,
aprons, and leggings, or they use the head ornament representing two
bears’ ears, which is made of bearskin set with woman’s hair, dyed
red. This ornament is used by all clans, or they wear masks repre-
senting their guardian spirits.

As an example of these, I will describe the spirit of sleep, which
belongs to the G-ispawaduwk/da. The owner of this spirit appears
sleeping, his face covered with a mask, the eyes of which are shut (fig.
656 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

214, p.659). Then a chief steps up and tries to awaken him by hauling
the drowsiness out of him with both his hands. Then the eyes of the
mask are opened and roll, while the man who wears the mask rises.
The chief who took the drowsiness out of the sleeper asks if he shall
try to put the people to sleep, and on being asked to do so he opens his
hands. The spirit is supposed to enter the people, and all close their
eyes. After some time he gathers the drowsiness again, and the people
awake and sing:

Oh, how sleepy we are; oh, how sleepy we are,

When the heat of the heaven strikes me, drowsiness comes upon me,

brought by the husband of the sleep,

Oh, how sleepy we are; oh, how sleepy we are.!

In this manner the spirit of sleep proves his presence and is asked to
try te bring back the novice.

Figure 215 (p. 660) shows another mask, which is
used ina similar way. It represents the cold. The
staring eyes, the chattering mouth, express the
extreme cold from which the wearer is suffering.

One dancer after another tries to bring back the
novice. If he does not return by midnight of the
first night, the ceremony is interrupted, and con-
tinued the following night. On one occasion a
member of the loOLE’m was the last to try. He took
his supernatural helper, a small, carved human
image, held it up, and asked it to bring back the
novice. Then he poured a spoon of grease into
the fire and threw the carving after it. At once the
whistles of the novice were heard on the roof. All
the lOLE’m rushed out of the house, but soon they
returned, saying that they had seen him, but lost

expected back on the following day. Early in the
morning a killer whale or some other animal is
seen on the river, carrying the novice on its back. He is crying ‘*‘ma,
ma, ma, ma,” all the time, and the people go to see him. The JOLE’m
take a canoe and paddle singing toward the novice. When they have
almost reached him, one of their number, who stays ashore clad in a
bearskin, drives all the people into the houses. The 1OLE’m take the
novice into their canoe and destroy the whale float which carried him,
and which is manipulated by means of ropes. Then he runs up and
down the street like one wild, and the olala’ follow him and bite any
of the profane who dare to leave the house. The novice catches a dog,
tears it to pieces, and eats it while he is going from house to kouse.

* See Appendix, page 733.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 657

When he thus returns, he is entirely naked. From the time when
he enters his house it becomes tabooed. A rope hung with red cedar
bark is stretched from the door of the house to a pole erected on the
beach, preventing the people from passing in front of the house and
compelling them to go behind. <A large ring of red cedar bark is fas-
tened to the pole in front of the house. These remain on the house for
a day after the return of the novice. On the following day four men
put on bearskins and place rings of red cedar bark on their heads. Thus
attired, they go from house to house inviting the people to see the dance
of the novice and to learn hissongs. When the people have assembled,
the uncle of the novice spreads blankets on the floor, on which the
youth dances. Then his uncle pays the
chiefs who tried to bring him back, and
distributes blankets among the other peo-
ple also. He gives a feast, in which two
kinds of berries are served, each mixed
with grease. Chiefs are given large spoons
filled with grease. Their people help them
to eat the contents, as they must not
leave any of the food that they receive.
After the ceremony the novice is called
Laamg:a’t (a perfect man).

People who want to become members of
the olala’ must have been shamans first.

tion of an olala’ was given by a man who

itiated, his friends pretended to begin a
quarrel. They drew knives and pretended to kill him. They let him
disappear, and cut off the head of a dummy, which had been skillfully
introduced. Then they laid the body down, covered it, and the women
began to mourn and to wail. His relatives gave a feast, distributed
blankets, slaves, canoes, and coppers, and burnt the body. In short,
they held a regular funeral.

After his disappearance, the young man resorted to a grave. He
_ took the body out of the grave and wrapped the blanket about himself
and the body. Thus he lay with the corpse for a whole night. The
other olala’ watched him from a distance. In the morning he put the
body back into the grave. He vontinued to do so for some time, in order
to acquire courage. All this time and for a whole year after he was
not seen by any member of the tribe except by the dlala’.

A year after his disappearance, his hephew invited all the tribes to
bring him back. This was done in the same manner as described
above in the case of initiation of the lOLE’/m. Finally his whistles were
heard, and he appeared
on the roof of the house
crying “a lalalalala!”
He disappeared again,
and in the following
night, after prolonged
dances, he was seen on
the hills dancing in a
fire, which he had built
in such a manner that

from underground, the Qanha‘da on the back of a frog. Sometimes the
hovice appears on a point of land some
distance from the Village, carrying a
corpse in his arms. Then he is said
to walk over the surface of the water
and to come ashore in front of the vil-
lage. This is accomplished by means
of a raft which is covered with planks,
and burdened so that it floats a short
distance under the surfaceof the water.
It is pulled by means of a rope by some
of the other Odlala’ while the novice is
dancing on it, so that the impression
is conveyed that he is approaching on
the surface of the water. When he
reaches the village, he eats of the body
which he is carrying, and one or other
of the chiefs kills a slave and throws
the body to the lala’, who devour it, It

begun. He hasaspoon and adish of hisown. These are wound withred
cedar bark. Those who have formerly been Olala’ are the servants of
the new member of the society and bring him food. When he hears
the word 1olEk (ghost), he grows excited and
begins to bite again. After he ceases to bite
and to devour human flesh, a heavy ring of red
cedar bark is placed around his neck, and he
is led slowly around the fire. The ceremony is
ealled “making him heavy” (sEp’a/lyix), and
means that he is by this weight prevented from
flying away and growing excited again. After
his initiation he must stay in his room for a
whole year. After biting, he must chew the
bark of ‘“devil’s club” (w60/mst), which acts
as a purgative.

those described before are practically identical.

blankets and their faces painted red. The chief wears the amhalait—a
‘arving rising from the forehead, set with sea-lion barbs, and with a
long drapery of ermine skins (see Plate 47)—the others, the cedar bark
rings of their societies. Then the women begin to dance. After a
while a prominent man rises to deliver a Speech. He says: “ All of
you know that our novice went up to heaven; then he made a mistake
and has been returned; now you will see him.” Then he begins the
song; the curtain is drawn and masked dancers are seen surrounding
the novice and representing the spirits which he has encountered in
heaven. At the same time eagle down is blown into the air. After
the dance is over the presents which were strung on the rope are dis-
tributed among the members of the secret society.

The novice has a beautifully painted room set apart for his use. He
remains naked during the dancing season. He must not look into the
fire. He must abstain from food and drink, and
is only allowed to moisten his lips occasionally.
He wears his head ring continually. After the
ceremonies are all finished the festival of « clothing
the novice” is celebrated. He sits in his room
quietly singing while the people assemble in the
house. His song is heard to grow louder, and at
last he makes his appearance. He has put off his
ring of red cedar bark. Then the people try to

throw a bear skin over him, which they sueceed in

The initiations are repeated from time to time, and the rank of a per-
son becomes the higher the more frequently he has gone through the
ceremony; but nobody, chiefs excepted, can be a member of more than
one secret society. The sEmhalai’t are in so far a preparatory step to
the societies, as everybody who wants to enter them must have acquired
the sEmhalai’t first. A member of one of the other societies, namely,
- the méiLa’/, nonLE/m or lala’, can not enter any other society, but
remains in the society in which he has been initiated. Those who have
passed twice through the sEmhalai’t ceremonies are called ts’é/ik.

XIV. THE GrowTrH oF THE SECRET SOCIETIES.

The secret societies of the Kwakiutl, as we know them nowadays,
are undoubtedly a complex growth. We will endeavor to elucidate, so
far as possible, the history of their development by means of the
material presented in the preceding paper.

A comparison of the ceremonials of the various tribes of the North
Pacific Coast, which were brietly described in the last chapter, does
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS. 661

not leave any doubt that they are in the main derived from the same
source. Not.only are the ceremonials much alike, but even their names
are identical. Among all the tribes, the badges of the ceremonials are
made ot cedar bark, which is dyed red in the juice of the alder. Head
rings, neck rings, and masks are worn by the dancers. The perform-
ances themselves are essentially the same from Alaska to Juan de Fuca
Strait. But the most certain proof of their common origin lies in the
identity of name among the various tribes. Among the Haida, Tlingit,
and Tsimshian we find the names olala, mé/iLa, and no/nLEm, which
belong to the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl as well. Among the Bilxula
the names can not be derived from the same words as among the other
tribes, but there the ceremonial itself is almost identical with that of
the Kwakiutl. It certainly does not differ more from the ceremonial as
described here than that of other tribes of Kwakiutl lineage differs
from the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl proper. Besides this, the names
of the dancers, if not those of their dances, are very often borrowed
from the Kwakiutl. Turning to the south, we find the Nootka as well
as the Salishan tribes who practice the ceremonial, terming it by the
two names LO/koala and no/nLEm, both of which are names used for
portions of the ceremonial of the Kwakiutl.

The following table exhibits the terms that are used to designate
parts of the-ceremonial among various tribes:

As all the words which I have enumerated belonged originally to the
Kwakiutl language, there can be no doubt that the ceremonial of the
Kwakiutl has influenced those of the neighboring tribes to a very
great extent. It does not follow necessarily that no secret societies
existed before the Kwakiutl exerted their influence over the people of
the coast. On the contrary, the wide distribution of secret societies
and the general similarity of the underlying principle all over North
America make it probable that such societies did exist. But there can
be no doubt that their present character was attained among the
Kwakiutl, from whom the societies in their present form spread over a
“vast territory.!

The question then arises, How did the societies acquire their peculiar
characteristics among the Kwakiutl? I may be allowed at this place to

It can not be proved that any connection exists between the hawi/nalat cere-
monies described on page 495 and the sun-dance ceremonies of the Sioux and Black-
feet, but their analogy is quite striking.
662 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

refer to what I stated previously (pp. 332, 336) in regard to the growth
of the clan system of the Kwakiutl tribes. I pointed out that this
system probably attained its present development under the impetus
of the clan system of the northern tribes; that the social distinction
connected with the possession of a clan legend gave a sufficient sugges-
tion to the mind of the Indian to turn his imagination in this direction,
and that the hereditary manitou probably became the totem of the clan.

The close similarity between the clan legends and those of the acquisi-
tion of spirits presiding over secret societies, as well as the intimate
relation between these and the social organizations of the tribes, allow
us to apply the same argument to the consideration of the growth of
the secret societies, and lead us to the conclusion that the same psy-
chical factor that molded the clans into their present shape molded the
secret societies.

If this argument is correct, we must expect that the legends of the
secret societies, although belonging to the most sacred myths of
the tribes, show indications of foreign influences, as these must have
offered the material for the suggestions which gave rise to the myths.
I will not at this place enter into a detailed discussion of these tradi-
tions as I have done so in another publication.’ I have shown that
all legends of this region are of complex origin, and that they must
have been carried over enormous distances from tribe to tribe. This is
true as well of the more insignificant tales as of the most important
myths, such as creation legends, and the legends of the origin of the
secret societies. To give only one or two examples: In the tale of the
origin of the cannibal society of the He/iltsuq (p. 401), it is told how a
woman gave birth to a number of dogs, who attained the secrets of the
cannibal society. This tale is found over the whole of the northwestern
portion of North America, among all the Athapascan tribes, among
the Eskimo, and all along the North Pacifie Coast. Only in this sin-
gle instance is it connected with the origin of the secret societies, and I
conclude, therefore, that a foreign story has been embodied in this myth.

While here the foreign portion of the myth forms only a slightly
connected incident of the tale, foreign material is much more closely
interwoven with the whole fabric in the most important one of all
the legends of secret societies, viz, the tale of Baxbakualanu Xsi’wae.-
When we compare this myth with the creation myth of the Chinook’
we find a remarkable resemblance in certain parts of the legends.
The grandmother of the divinity of the Chinook, when a child, was car-
ried away by a monster. Their child became the mother of the culture
hero, and by her help the monster was slain. Among the Kwakiutl, the
cannibal spirit carries away a girl, and is finally slain by her help.
In one version, their child becomes the new cannibal spirit. There
exist several stories on the west coast of Vancouver Island which form

'“Indianische Sagen von der Nord-Pacifischen Kiiste Amerikas,” Berlin, 1895, p.
329.

-“ Chinook Texts,” Bulletin T 20o0f the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1894, p.9.
THE KWAKIUTL INDIANS, 663

probably the connecting links between these two legends. Further-
more, the important incident of the magie flight which figures in the
Kwakiutl legend (p. 400) has so wide a distribution, not only on the
Pacific Coast but also in the Old World, that we must consider it a
foreign element in this myth.!

These instances show that the myths referring to the ceremonial are
of complex origin.

I will point out another peculiarity of these traditions: When we
compare the legends as told by the various tribes of the coast, we find
that the ceremonial is derived from a variety of myths. Some men
obtained it from BaxbakualanuXsi’waé, others from the wolves, still
others brought it down from heaven. The legend of the Tsimshian tells
that a hunter obtained it from a bear who took him into his lodge in
the interior of a rock (p. 652). Traditions which are entirely distinct
in character and origin are brought forward to explain the origin of
the same ceremonial.

What does this prove? We have seen that none of the tales referred
to can be considered as a growth of the genius of any of these tribes
uninfluenced by any foreign sources. All the traditions are full of for-
eign elements which can be traced, step by step, to distant regions.
When we see, therefore, that the same ritual is explained by a variety
of traditions, we must conclude that in this region at least the ritual is
older than the tradition referring to the ritual; that the former must be
considered as primary, the latter as secondary.

I believe the source of the ritual, as well as of the legends which are
connected with it, must be looked for in the advantages and the pre-
rogatives which the membership of secret societies gives. This must
have caused a desire to possess such membership, which either led
men to acquire memberships in existing societies, or, where these were
not sufficient, for the people to invent new ones. Of course, I do not
mean to say that the Indian invented traditions consciously and
intentionally, but that the desire excited his fancy and his whole state
of mind, and that in this manner, after appropriate fasting, the oppor-
tunity was given for hallucinations, the material for which was neces-

sarily taken from the existing ideas, or from the ideas of neighboring

tribes. These are the peculiar phenomena which were set forth by
Stoll in his book on Suggestion, and I think in a deeper manner by
Tarde in his book on the Laws of Imitation.

It is easily understood how the exciting aspect of the ceremonial of
the cannibal society caused a young man who had gone fasting to
believe that he saw in his hallucinations the same spirit under new
conditions, and to tell of his experience after his return. As the
notion had become established that the spirit, after having been seen,
had a tendency to reappear to the descendants, an opportunity was
given for the formation of a new place in the secret society. We may

-
664 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

therefore assume that the psychological explanation for the develop-
ment of the complicated system of the membership in secret societies
lies in the combined action of the social system on the one hand and
the method of acquiring manitous on the other.

While these considerations explain the variety of forms of the secret
societies and prove that the myths on which the ritual is apparently
founded are probably secondary in character, they do not give a clew
to the origin of the secret societies and of the peculiar customs con-
nected with them. There are, however, indications which allow us to
conclude that these customs had their origin in methods of warfare.
First of all, the deity Wina‘lag-ilisis considered the bringer of the cere-
monial. This name means “the one who makes war upon the whole
world,” and he rules the mind of man at the time of war as well as
during the period of activity of the secret societies. For this reason,
also, the secret societies are in action during times of war, in winter as
well as in summer (see p. 429). All the oldest songs of these socie-
ties have reference to war; the cannibal, the bear dancer, and the
fool dancer, are considered as chief warriors, and fall into ecstasies as
soon as they have killed an enemy. All this seems to indicate that
the origin of the secret societies has a close connection with warfare.

But one thing more must be considered. The customs which we
observe nowadays are evidently a modern development of more ancient
forms. The ceremonial of cannibalism, which nowadays is the most
important part of the whole ceremonial, is known to have been intro-
duced among the various tribes recently, although its foundation, the
idea of the existence of a spirit who is killing people, is present among
all the tribes. The Kwakiutl state uniformly that the custom of
devouring men was introduced among their tribe about sixty years
ago, and that it was derived from the He/iltsuq. We also have
conclusive evidence that the custom was acquired by the Tsimshian
not more than seventy years ago, and that they also obtained it
from the Hé/iltsuq. Therefore there is no doubt that the custom origi-
nally was confined to the small territory of the He‘iltsuq. Among the
southern tribes the action of the cannibal was confined to his taking
hold with his teeth of the heads of enemies, which were cut off in war.

The form in which the ceremony of cannibalism of the He/iltsuq
appeared first was the following: A slave was killed by his owner, and
then was torn and eaten by the cannibals, or pieces of flesh were torn
with the teeth from the arms or the chest of people, or, finally, corpses
which were prepared in a particular manner were devoured by the can-
nibal. The first of these customs shows clearly its close connection
with warfare. The slave is the booty of the cannibal or of his relatives,
and by slaying him the victory is once more brought before the eyes of
his admiring friends. It is hardly possible to prove definitely that the
secret societies have developed exclusively from customs relating to
warfare, but I believe my remarks have made clear the close connection
between the two phenomena.

The three part beats are syncopated, the sticks being raised at each
quarter and therefore falling nearly on the second eighth of the three
part bar. The four part rhythm is syncopated in the same manner.
The rhythm of the tune of the second line, Lats’ek-as g-anEMLeé, is not
quite certain. I counted the f of the second bar almost three eighths,
and also in the seventh bar of this part, but there seemed to be
throughout slight irregularities in rhythm of the first seven bars of
this part of the song, though the beating is perfectly regular, five
eighths against three of the tune. The text as sung by my informant
differs slightly from the dictated text.

Honorary Curator. Ethnological Museum, Catholic University of America, Washing-
ton, D.C.

INTRODUCTION.

In the selection of appropriate materials upon which to inseribe
his thoughts, primitive man was governed to a great extent by his
environment.

In a country abounding in rocks and cliffs, it was but natural for
him to portray upon a smooth conspicuous surface the record of an
exploit, or a character to direct his companions on the right trail or
to a convenient camping place. In that portion of the West known
as the “Great Plains,” rock pictures are of seldom occurrence. The
numerous tribes of many different languages were hunters of the
buffalo, and in their frequent movements from place to place found
the skin of that animal, as well as that of the deer, the most con-
venient. Along the shores of the Great Lakes, where the white birch
is of frequent occurrence, the Indians employ the bark of this tree for
their mnemonic and other records. The bark, when fresh, is tough,
and retains permanently the slightest markings indented or incised
upon it by means of a sharply pointed bone or nail.

Various Indian tribes employ, also, other substances, such as bone,
wood, and various arrangements of shell beads, as well as feathers and
textile substances, to convey special forms of information.!

The Innuit or Eskimo of Alaska utilize the tusks of the walrus, and
in occasional instances the horns of the reindeer. The tusks are cut
longitudinally into rods, upon the faces of which delicate engravings
or etchings are made, the depressions or incisions thus produced being
filled with black or some other color so as to heighten the effect.

The Eskimo of Greenland, Labrador, and the remaining portions of
the Arctic regions east of the delta of the Mackenzie River, use flat
pieces of wood upon which to exercise their more primitive skill at art
ornamentation. Although ivory is abundant in some portions of the
Melville Peninsula, yet it appears generally absent in the collections
from that region,

750 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

While the accompanying paper is based chiefly upon the collection
in the United States National Museum, quite a number of valuable
data were found in the interesting collection of ivory records in the
museum of the Alaska Commercial Company in San Francisco, Cali-
fornia.

In addition to these two sources of information, the writer was so
fortunate as to have the services in San Francisco of a native Alaskan
half-caste, who had for a number of years been in the employ of the
Commercial Company. This man had spent most of his life in travel-
ing among the various settlements of southern Alaska, chiefly for the
purpose of securing furs and peltries in exchange for goods desired by
the natives. Vladimir Naomoff, in addition to his thorough familiarity
with the Russian and English language, was fluent in five or six native
dialects. His keen observation of the habits of the people of the main-
land, and their various methods of conveying information by recording
on different materials their thoughts, enabled him to interpret with ease
the numerous records in the museum referred to; and he also prepared a
number of sketches in imitation of records which he had observed, and
which he had been instructed to prepare and deposit at habitations at
which he had called during the absence of the regular occupants or
owners.

The primary studies relating to the subject of the interpretation of
pictographs were begun by the writer in 1871; and but limited prog-
ress was made until the year 1879, when the Bureau of Ethnology was
organized and furnished the facility necessary to officially conduct
investigations among the various Indian tribes of the United States
and British Columbia, and to visit nearly all known pictographs and
petroglyphs in order to make personal investigations, comparisons,
and to secure tracings and sketches thereof.

In addition to these researches in pictography, the gesture language
of the various tribes was also studied, the latter frequently aiding very
materially in interpreting obscure characters, and attempts at the
graphic portrayal of gestures and subjective ideas.!

The collection of gesture signs obtained from Vladimir Naomoff, and
subsequently verified, to a great extent, by a Mahlemut native from
St. Michael’s, is appended hereto,’ in connection with the list of objects
in the National Museum, to which special reference is made.

These gesture signs are of importance in the study and interpreta-
tion of many of the Eskimo records.

Many of these gesture signs are natural, and intelligible to most
people who are known, on account of peculiar linguistic position, to
have knowledge of this mode of communication because of their

inability to comprehend the oral speech of surrounding tribes. Other
gestures were peculiar to these natives because of the unique resources
of their peculiar environment; and others again were highly interest-
ing because of the coneept being hidden in some old custom, shaman-
istic ceremonial, or individual practice of the person having recourse
to a particular idea. ;

In a number of the records will be observed outlines of the human
figure, with hands and arms, and sometimes the lower extremities, in
curious and apparently unnatural positions. Such portrayals are
attempts at illustrating gesture signs pictorially, and subjective ideas
are thus indicated—a step very much in advance of the ordinary sys-
tem of pictography as known to and practiced by most of the Indian
tribes.

It is obvious, therefore, that in order to fully comprehend the inten-
tion of a pictographic record, it is necessary to know the artist’s needs,
his environment and resources, his beliefs and shamanistic observ-
ances, and as much of the gesture language as may be obtainable.

From a careful study of the pictographs of the several Indian tribes
and the numerous petroglyphs and painted records scattered over
various portions of the United States, it is safe to assert that a com-
parison of these with the various artistic materials of the Eskimo show
the latter to be vastly superior to the preceding, especially in faithful
reproduction of animal forms and delicacy of artistic execution.

The portrayal of the reindeer, in particular, serves as an illustration
of the manner in which the Eskimo are close observers as to anatomi-
cal peculiarities, as well as in catching the expression indicated in
various attitudes assumed by these animals in grazing, rising, running,
and in the positions assumed to denote alarm, fear, ete.

In the portrayal of whales the Eskimo artist is also careful as to
specific anatomical features. The peculiar elevation at the spout or
blowhole of the ‘“‘bowhead” is especially indicated, and is character-
istic of the species, as that part of the mammal is used to raise and
keep open the elastic “granular” salt ice for breathing holes or for
spouting.

The smaller whale, designated also as the California gray, the ‘‘mus-
sel digger,” or “devilfish,” is likewise specifically indicated by a more
pointed head and sharp flukes, and I can only call attention to the
sharp flukes and conspicuous fins of the “killer” to illustrate the
result of observation given to it by the native artist in endeavoring
to show graphically the part which, to him, is a specific identification
of the animal.

In a few illustrations the walrus is very carefully engraved, and
although the native result may appear uncouth and cumbersome, yet a
comparison of the etchings with the illustration of that animal will at
once serve to show strikingly careful imitation of the original subject.
As to the portrayal of various other animal forms, they are, generally,

T52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

sufficiently true to nature to admit of ready identification. The imita-
tion of the specific construction of the kaiak and the umiak is usually
excellent, as also the various forms of dog sledges peculiar to certain
localities in Alaska and faithfully represented in a number of etchings.
For the purpose of further comparison between the Eskimo portrayal
and the manufactured vehicle, several illustrations of the latter are
reproduced in figures.

The Eskimo is not an expert in portraying the human form. It is
‘certain that in various instances man is indicated by linear outlines or
incisions very much in imitation of that of the Shoshonian tribes, the
head being a mere circular spot, from which is suspended a line ter-
minating below in two legs, and beneath the head being attached two
lateral lines for arms. These extremities may be drawn: in various
attitudes, but apart from the attitude no further notice would be given
to them. This forms a marked contrast as compared with the same
idea as portrayed by various Algonkian tribes, notably so the Ojibwa,
who devote much artistic attention to the head, dress, and ornaments
of the character intended to represent a human being.

The peculiarity of Eskimo graphic art as compared with that of
other peoples will be treated of farther on. The subject forms the basis
of the present paper, and was made possible through the courtesy of
Doctor G. Brown Goode, Director in charge of the United States
National Museum, and my indebtedness to Professor O. ‘I. Mason,
Curator of Ethnology, is hereby gratefully acknowledged for his val-
uable suggestions and for placing at my disposal every facility for the
careful examination of specimens in his custody, not all of which, how-
ever, were deemed of sufficient importance to illustrate, as such a pro-
cedure would have resulted in considerable duplication.

THE ESKIMO.
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.

The Eskimauan, or Innuit,! linguistic family occupies the greater
portion of the coast of Aretie America, Greenland, the Aleutian
Islands, and a small area of the Chukche Peninsula of Siberia. The
extreme points are about 3,200 miles apart, though to follow the shores
would necessitate a journey of 5,000 miles.

The interior portions of the continent are occupied by various Indian
tribes, belonging to several conspicuous linguistic families, but the
Eskimo, under various designations, have always apparently confined
themselves to the seashore and the country adjacent thereto, not
exceeding 50 miles inland, except in following various river courses in.
pursuit of game.

The easternmost branch of the Eskimo is that represented by natives

1 Although the term Innuit is frequently employed, and may be linguistically
proper, the writer employs the more popular term, viz: Eskimo.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 153

along the north and east coast of Greenland, two families being met
with by Captain Clavering in 1823, north of 74° 30’, Captain Holm
recently found them on the southeast coast between 65° and 66° north
latitude. These are said to profess ignorance of any natives north
of them. On the west coast of Greenland they extend to about 74°
north latitude. General Greely found indications of permanent settle-
ments in Grinnell Land, near Fort Conger, at 81° 44’ north latitude.

Mr. Henry G. Bryant, in his “‘ Notes on the most northern Eskimos,”!
says:

As is well known, the most northern Eskimos were first visited by Sir John Ross
in 1818, and he first applied to them the term ‘‘ Arctic Highlanders.” As the appro-
priateness of this appellation seems quite questionable as applied to a tribe living
wholly on the seacoast, I have preferred to use the term ‘‘most northern Eskimos,”
as being more descriptive and appropriate in its character. This tribe inhabits that
rugged strip of indented coast in northwest Greenland which extends for about
550 miles from Cape York to a point somewhat south of the southern edge of the
Humboldt glacier. Itis a fact well known that the impassible ice walls which occur
at Loth of these points have thus far served as effectual barriers to any extended
migrations of this tribe. It is owing to this enforced isolation that at this late day
we find here the most typical of the Eskimo family groups—a primitive tribe who
are but just emerging from the Stone Age, whose members still dress in skins, eat
raw flesh, and pursue their game with the same sort of rude weapons that their
forefathers used in prehistoric times.

Orn

Doctor Kane, in 1855, noted this tribe as numbering 140, while
Mr. Bryant remarks that Lieutenant Peary places the census at fully
250.

On the Labrador Coast the Eskimo extend southward to Hamilton
Inlet at about 55° 30’, north latitude, though it is not so long since
they were located at the Straits of Belle Isle.

On the east coast of Hudson Bay these natives reach southward to
James Bay; while northward it is on Ellsmere Land and around Jones
Sound that Doctors Boas and Bessels place the northernmost groups
of the middle Eskimo. Several of the northern Arctic islands present
evidence of former occupancy, but for some unknown cause the natives
migrated thence. The western part of the central region of the con-
tinent seems unoccupied, and from the Mackenzie westward the coast
seems to have no permanent villages between Herschel Island and
Point Barrow. This strip of country is no doubt hunted over in sum-
mer, as the natives of the latter locality do not penetrate far into the
interior for game.

The Alaskan Coast from Point Barrow to the Copper River on the
south is practically occupied by Eskimo of various villages or bands,
as will hereafter be more fully described.

‘The Aleutian Islands are occupied to a certain extent by a branch
of the same linguistic family, though the dialects are unintelligible
to the Eskimo proper. Their distribution has been very materially

changed since the advent of the Russians and the establishment of the
fur trade, and at present they are located principally on a few of the
largest islands only.

On the Asiatic side this family is represented by the Yuit, who are
distinct from the Chukche, or Tuski of authors, who are of Asiatic
origin, and of a distinct linguistic group. The Yait are also a coast
people, and, according to Mr. Dall, are comparatively recent arrivals
from the American side. Between the Siberian and the Alaskan
coasts are the Diomede Islands, a convenient stopping place for voy-
agers between the two continental points above mentioned. At these
islands Simeon Déshneff, in 1648, found natives wearing labrets who
were at war with the Tiski. Similar reports were made by Shestakoff,
in 1730. Peter Popoff, who visited the Asiatic mainland about 1711
for the purpose of collecting tribute from the Chukche, describes the
habitations and remarks that ‘che found among the Tiski ten of the
islanders wearing labrets, who had been taken prisoners of war.”!

Mr. Dall? observes that the Tuski do not wear labrets, which
distinguishing feature, compared with the Chukche, was noticed by
Déshneff, as well as all subsequent voyagers. Both sexes tattoo, not
only over the face but all over the body. The women in probably all
instances bear tattooed vertical lines on the chin, a practice which is
not followed by the men. An illustration of tattooing upon the chin
of a Port Clarence woman is given elsewhere.

Concerning the representatives of the Eskimo upon the Asiatie side
of Bering Strait, the following remarks are reproduced from the memo-
randa concerning “the Arctic Eskimos in Alaska and Siberia,” by
John W. Kelly,’ interpreter, who says of the ‘Siberian Eskimos:”

There are settlements of Eskimos at Cape Tchaplin (Indian Point), Plover Bay,
and East Cape. How long they have been there and how much of the country they
have occupied can only be conjectured. Those occupying St. Lawrence Island, Cape
Tchaplin, and part of the shores of Plover Bay, on the mainland of Asia, opposite
St. Lawrence Island, speak a dialect nearer like that of Point Barrow or the Mac-
kenzie River than the dialects of the Diomedes or Kotzebue Sound. That the
Eskimos of Asia have been there a great many years is a certainty. The Deermen
people, whose principal support is domesticated reindeer, have gradually crowded
out the Eskimo or Fishmen, and have almost absorbed them by assimilation. They
wear no labrets, and in dress and tattooing are the same as the Deermen. That
they have lived in underground houses is abundantly proved by the ruins at Cape
Tehaplin of old huts which have been framed with the whole jaws of whales. Now
they live in huts above ground, covered with walrus hides. They are built in the
same manner as those of the Deermen, who use a covering of reindeer robes. From
the Deermen they have also learned to cremate their dead, instead of scattering the
bodies over the plain, according to the custom of the American Eskimos. Like the
American Eskimos, they deposit the personal property of the deceased at his grave.
If he was a great hunter, they also erect a monument of reindeer antlers over his

grave. At East Cape, Siberia, there is a trace of the Arctic Eskimos, but differing
from their nearest neighbors, the Diomede people.

In the vicinity of Kast Cape there are a few ruins of underground houses, and a
few Eskimo words are still used by the people. Twenty miles westward from Cape
Tchaplin is Plover Bay, where both the Eskimo and Deermen language is spoken,
but the Eskimo is on a rapid decline.

SUBTRIBES OR SETTLEMENTS.

The Eskimo of littoral Alaska are divided into a considerable num-
ber of geographic divisions, popularly designated as tribes, and are
here briefly enumerated chiefly according to W. H. Dall’s arrangement,
his orthography being generally maintained.

The accompanying map of Alaskan and Asiatic coasts will serve to
further aid in locating the points occupied by the various native settle-
ments below enumerated. Plate 1.

The Aleutians, properly so called, are divided into two tribes, the
Atkans and Unalashkans. The former belong to the western part of
the archipelago, and the latter were originally confined to the eastern
portion. The original name of these people signified, according to
Humboldt, ‘‘People of the Hast,” and they have been regarded as
having originally come from the continent, a reference to which theory
will be made further on.

The Ugalakmut |= Aigaltiixamiut]! is the southernmost tribe, begin-
ning nearly at the mouth of the Copper River and extend westward to
Icy Bay. Some of the eastern bands have become mixed by inter-
marriage with the Thlinkit. ‘‘The Chugachmuts occupy the shores
and islands of Chugach.Gulf, and the southwest coasts of the penin-
sula of Kenai.” They are few in number, compared with the large
extent of country they occupy.

The Kaniagmuts occupy the island of Kadiak and the greater por-
tion of the peninsula of Aliaska. This is probably the most popular of
all the Eskimo tribes. They extend from Lliamna Lake to 159° west
longitude.

The Oglemuts occupy the Aliaska peninsula along the northern coast,
from 159° west longitude to the head of Bristol Bay, and along the
north shore of that bay to Point Etolin.

The Kiatéqamiut inhabit the coast from near the mouth of Nushergak
River westward to Cape Newenham. They are the Nushergagmuts of
Dall, who remarks of them as particularly excelling in carving ivory,
and that most of their weapons and tools are made of this material.

The Kuskwogmuts “inhabit both shores of Kuskoqtim Bay, and
some little distance up that river.”

The Agulmuts extend “from near Cape Avénoff nearly to Cape
Romanzoff. There are also a number of settlements of the same tribe
on the island of Ntinivak.”

‘All words, or remarks, within brackets are added by the present writer.
756 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The Magemuts “inhabit the vicinity of Cape Romanzoff, and reach
nearly to the mouth of the Yukon. They resemble their southern
neighbors more than they do those to the north of them. The women
wear labrets. The name Magemut signifies ‘Mink people.’ ”

The Ekogmuts “inhabit the Yukon delta from Kipniuk to Pastolik,
and ascend the river as far as Mauki, some distance above the mission-
Those who inhabit the Kwikhpak slough call themselves Kwikhpagmut,
a lame sometimes applied to the whole tribe.” A peculiarity ‘‘in many
of them is the extreme hairiness of their persons. Many of them have
very strong black beards and hairy bodies.”

The Unaligmuts, or Unaleet, “occupy the coast from Pastolik to
Shaktolik.” They have also been designated as the Aziagmut.

The Mahlemuts ‘occupy the coast of Norton Sound and Day north
of Shaktolik and the neck of the Kavidk Peninsula to Selawik Lake.
Their most eastern village is Attenmut, and their western boundary
the river which flows northward into Spavarieff Bay, Kotzebue Sound.”

The Kavidgmiuts occupy the Kaviak Peninsula and Sledge or Aziak
Island. ‘ Many of them pass the winter in the southern part of Nor- —
ton Sound, and there is a large Kaviak village at Unalaklik. * * *
Their principal villages are Nookmut, at Port Clarence, and Knik-
Tagmut, on Golofnina Bay.”

The portrait of a Kaviagmiut man, aged 33 years, is given in in 2.
He is a very intelligent native, and is a clever artisan. Another type
of the same tribe is shown in the person of Suku‘ut, aged 25 years,
from the same locality, plate 3. An interesting ‘abr ation of a girl
aged 17 years is presented in plate 4. She has a remarkably clear skin,
pink cheeks, and bears upon her chin the usual pattern of tattooed
lines, extending downward from the mouth.

In plate 5 is reproduced the portrait of an inhabitant of the village
of Nuwik, at Point Barrow. The features are very much less pleasing
than those shown in the preceding figures. Plate 6 represents a young
man from the village of Utkiavwin.!

The Oke-6gmuts are essentially the same as the preceding, but the
name is applied ‘by the Innuit to the small and energetic tribe who
inhabit the islands by Bering Strait. They carry on the trade between
the two continents, and visit the island of St. Michael every year for
the purpose. I have also heard the same name applied to the inhab-
itants of St. Lawrence Island.”

The Eskimo of the Point Barrow region are located, according to Mr.
Murdoch,’ in the villages of Nuwtk and Utkiavwif. Nuwik signifies
‘“‘the Point,” and is a slightly elevated knoll at the extremity of Point
Barrow, in latitude 71° 23’ north, longitude 156° 17’ west. Utkiavwin
Signifies ‘the Cliffs,” is 11 miles west from Nuwik, at Cape Smyth,
and is also a high ridge. The nearest neighbors to the east are those

at Herschel Island, or Demarcation Point, and on the west at a small
village between Point Belcher and Wainright Inlet. The natives of
these villages are so closely connected, says Mr. Murdoch, “that they
are sometimes spoken of collectiveiy as Sidarunmium” (= Sidarunmiut).
‘“ At a distance up the river, which flows into Wainright Inlet, live the
Kunmiun, ‘the people who-live on the river.” These appear to be
closely related to the first village below Wainright Inlet, which is
named Kilauwitawin.” !

The people at Point Hope, according to Mr. Murdoch, are known as
the Tikera/nmiun, ‘inhabitants of the forefinger (Point Hope).”

The natives along the eoast east of Point Barrow to and beyond the
Mackenzie are often spoken of by the Hudson Bay traders as the Mae-
kenzie River Eskimo. They appear to be identical with those described
by Father Petitot as the Tapeopmeut |=Tayeoymeut} division of the
Tehiglit, and are termed by Murdoch the Kuptinmiun, and inhabit the
permanent villages at the “ western mouth of the Mackenzie, at Shingle
Point and Point Sabine, with an outlying village, supposed to be
deserted, at Point Kay.” Still another tribe is located at Anderson
River and Cape Bathurst, not considered by Petitot as the above
named, as he applies the name Kyagmalit. Sir John Richardson, the
first to meet with them [1826], calls them ‘“ Kette-garrce-oot.” ”

POPULATION.

With reference to the population of the Eskimo of the several divi-
sions, only approximate figures can be given. The Greenland group,
consisting of seventeen villages on the east coast, are stated by Holm,
in 1884-85, to number about 550, while on the west coast the ‘‘ mission
Eskimo” numbered 10,122 in 1886, and the northern Greenland Eskimo,
or Arctic Highlanders of Ross, number about 200,

Doctor Boas estimates the “ Central or Baffin Land Eskimo” at
about 1,100.

The natives along the coast in Labrador are stated by Rink, Packard,
and others, to number about 2,000 souls.°

The Alaskan Eskimo, comprising those of the mainland, as well as
the few (40?) upon Little Diomede Island, together with those on St.
Lawrence Island and the Aleutian Islanders, are estimated by Dall
and others at about 20,000.

This, excepting the Siberian tribe, makes a total of about 34,000
Eskimo. What the former population, before the introduction of liquor
and social vices, may have been it is impossible to conjecture. It is
stated by one author (Dali) that the Aleutians formerly were estimated
at 20,000, but recently numbered only 1,500, which figure has also been
given by others, though according to a still later estimate these
islanders were put down at 2,200.

EARLY EXPLORATIONS.

For reasons which will hereafter become evident, it is necessary to
refer briefly to the several explorations made to eastern Siberia, and
later to the American mainland. In the following historical references
I use freely Mr. Dall’s remarks, published in his work, “Alaska and
its Resources,” of which note has before been made.

In the year 1646, the Russians, under Isai Ignatief, pushed their
explorations to the east of the Kelyma River, the mouth of which is at
about latitude 69° 30/ north and longitude 161° 30/ east, and obtained
by barter from some Chukche specimens of walrusivory. In the follow-
ing year, 1647, four small vessels sailed eastward of Kolyma, the party
being under the command of a Cossack, named Simeon Déshneff. The
object of this expedition was to reach the Anadyr River, of which vague
reports had been received. Other explorers followed, but it was not
until 1648 that the northeast coast of Asia was passed and Bering Sea
entered.

Various explorers continued, from year to year, to visit different por-
tions of the coast of Kamchatka, but it was not until .711 that a Cos-
sack, named Peter Ilitinsen Popoff, arrived at East Cape with the
intention of collecting tribute from the Chukeche. The visit proved
fruitless, but Popoff returned with an account of the Diomede Island-
ers and the Chukche account of a continent which lay to the east and
beyond these islands.

On account of the interest manifested in these discoveries, scientific
men succeeded in obtaining the attention of Peter the Great, and
instructions for an expedition were delivered to Admiral Apraxin. A
few days later the Emperor died, but the Empress, in order to fulfill the
wishes of the deceased monarch, ordered the execution of the instruc-
tions, and Captain Vitus Bering was nominated to command the expe-
dition. Although the original plan was formulated in 1725, it was not
until 1727 that Bering and his companions left St. Petersburg. He
sailed past what is now known as St. Lawrence Island, through Bering
Strait, and, thus proving the separation of Asia and America, returned
to the Kamchatka River on the 20th of September without having seen
either the Diomede Islands or the American Coast. He returned to
St. Petersburg in 1730, but again went on a voyage of discovery and
Janded on Bering Island, where he died December 8, 1741.

In the meantime various other navigators and explorers had been
making considerable progress in exploring the shores of Kamchatka
and approaching the American Coast. In 1731 Pavlutskireached Cape
Serdze Kaman, in the hope of securing from the Chukche some tribute.
This resulted in failure, and in the interim Gwosdeff sailed to the
Chukche Coast; a gale drove him eastward, “where they found an
island, and beyond it the shores of the continent of America. They met
a native in a Kyak, and sailed two days along the coast without being
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 759

able to land. A storm came up and they returned to Kamchatka.
This completed the exploration of Bering Strait, which had been com-
menced by Déshneff and his companions.”!

It was not until July, 1741, that Chirikoff arrived off the American
Coast, near Cross Sound. Boats were sent there upon two occasions,
and several days later two canoes, filled with natives, came near the
ship, but immediately fled to the shore. Various islands were seen by
Chirikoff on his return to Kamchatka. During this visit 21 men were
lost, de la Croyeére, the naturalist, dying of scurvy.

Bering saw land on July 2, and anchored near an island two days
later.

Emilian Bassoff discovered the island of Attu, the westernmost of
the Aleutian group, in 1745. Glotloff discovered the island of Kadiak,
or Kaniag as it was designated by some of the natives, in July, 1763.
These islanders were less disposed to friendliness and gave frequent
evidences of hostility.

About 1764 Lieutenant Lynd was put in command of an expedition
which was organized under the direction of the Empress Catherine.
He did not leave Kamchatka until 1767, sailing from Ochotsk toward
Bering Strait, passing St. Matthew and St. Lawrence islands, saw
Diomede Island, and finally landed on the American Coast south of
Cape Prince of Wales. Further explorations of the peninsula of
Alaska was made by Krenitzin in 1768.

Cook entered Bering Strait in August, 1778, and, on his return,from
a voyage northward, explored Norton Sound and Bay. On October 3
he again touched at Unalashka, sailed for the Sandwich Islands, where
he was killed by the natives in 1779.

As early as 1788, Mares and Douglas, supercargoes, sailed from
Maeas to Nootka and to Cooks Inlet. The Spanish claimed the right
to sail the Pacific on the northwest coast of America.

In 1791 Billings and Sarycheff visited Unalashka, St. Paul, St. Law-
rence, Aziak, and the Diomedes; also touched on the American Coast
near Cape Prince of Wales, and then anchored in St. Lawrence Bay
on the Asiatic side.

In 1793 the Empress of Russia issued an ukase authorizing the
introduction of missionaries into the American colonies, and to the
works of these patient laborers we are indebted for many interesting
and valuable facts respecting the history of the customs and manners
of that time. It is singular, however, that although their accounts
often appear unusually concise and comprehensive, the practice of
engraving upon ivory and bone, seems to have been entirely over-
looked, or more likely may not have been in vogue among them. This
subject, however, will be further treated elsewhere.

The natives of Point Barrow are said never to have seen a white
man until the year 1826, when the barge of the Blossom, under Captain

‘Dall. ‘‘Alaska and its inhabitants,” p. 299.
760 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Beechey, visited their coast. They had, however, received from south-
ern neighbors articles of European manufacture introduced by the
Russians, such as tobacco, copper, and other articles, some of which
were obtained, according to Murdoch’s statement,! by way of the
Diomede Islands and Siberia.

Visits by other navigators were made at long intervals, and it was
not till 1854 that the first whaling vessel came to the Point.

Although the Point Barrow natives are provided with firearms, they
would be unable, by means of these alone, to obtain any seals, ‘as

their own BERD ees for sealing are much better than any civilized con- |

trivances.”! Mr. Murdoch, whom I have here quoted, states furthermore
that “all are now rich in iron, civilized tools, canvas and wreck wood,
and in this respect their condition is improved.” Nevertheless, in so far
as the graphic art is concerned, they appear to be considerably behind
the natives of Bristol Bay and Norton Sound.

The eminent Danish antiquarian, Doctor Henry Rink,’ in his remarks
on the probable origin of the Eskimo, speaks of their former location
in Greenland as follows:

According to the sagas of the Icelanders, they were already met with on the east
coast of Greenland about the year 1000, and almost at the same time on the east coast
of the American continent. Between the years 1000 and 1300, they do not seem to

have occupied the land south of 65° north latitude, on the west coast of Greenland,
where the Scandinavian colonies were then situated. But the colonists seem to

have been aware of their existence in higher latitudes and to have lived in fear of

an attack by them, since, in the year 1266, an expedition was sent out for the pur
pose of exploring the abodes of the Skrielings, as they were called by the colonists.
In 1379 the northernmost settlement was attacked by them, eighteen men being
killed and two boys carried off as prisoners. About the year 1450 the last’ accounts
were received from the colonies, and the way to Greenland was entirely forgotten
in the northern country.

Doctor Rink says that the Eskimos of southern Greenland present
features indicating ‘‘mixed descent from Scandinavians and Eskimo,”
the former, however, not having left any sign of influence of their cul-
ture or nationality upon the present natives.

In 1585 Greenland was discovered anew, by John Davis, who found
it inhabited exclusively by Eskimo.

In the work before cited,’ Doctor Henry Rink remarks:

Recent investigations have revealed differences between the Eskimo tribes which
indicate that, after having taken their first step to being an exclusively maritime
people, they have still during their migrations been subjected to further develop-
ment in the same direction, aiming at adapting them especially for the Arctic coasts
as their proper home. The farther we go back ‘toward their supposed original
country, the more of what may be considered their original habits we find still pre-
served. In the general history of culture these variations must certainly appear
trifling, but still I believe that a closer examination of them will throw light on the
question how the most desolate and Geter ie regions of the Eee could become

peopled. The solution of this problem is facilitated by the fact that the whole
Eskimo nation has been less exposed to that contact with other peoples which else-
where renders such investigations more complicated. These variations are among
the Eskimo more exclusively due to natural influences to which the wanderers were
exposed during their struggle for existence, and which partly gave rise to new inven-
tions, partly led only to the abolishment of former habits. In some instances also
these external influences evidently occasioned decay where the severity of the
climate in copnection with the isolation and the fewness of inhabitants almost
exceeded the bounds of human endurance.

Doctor Rink endeavors to show from this point of view ‘the peculiar-
ities of the tribes in the different domains of culture agree with the
supposition that the original Eskimo inhabited the interior of Alaska;
that apart from the true Eskimo a side branch of them in the farthest
remote period peopled the Aleutian Islands, whereas people of the
principal race later settled at the river mouths, spreading north-
ward along Bering Strait and, hiving off some colonies to the opposite
shore, proceeded around Point Barrow to the east, the Mackenzie River,
over the central regions or Arctic Archipelago, and finally to Labrador
and Greenland. This dispersion may have taken thousands of years;
they can only have proceeded in small bands, very much as still they
are used to move about during certain seasons. Their only way of
procuring subsistence in the vast deserts they passed over, excluded
the possibility of national migrations on a larger scale. While in this
way they continued to discover new countries, some families were
induced to go farther; others remained and finally gave rise to the
present scattered settlements. But, in proposing this hypothesis, I con-
sider it a matter of course that Alaska as the original home of the
Eskimo is not to be taken in the strictest sense, absolutely excluding
adjacent parts of the continent toward the east. But as to the other
theory, that the Eskimo should have emigrated from Asia by way of
Bering Strait and found the Indian territory already occupied by the
same natives as now, this objection must be separately taken into con-
sideration in connection with the facts bearing in favor of the former.”

SHELL HEAPS IN THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS.

The only important researches regarding prehistoric remains in
Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are those of Mr. Dall.! He remarks
that the “shell heaps are found on nearly all the islands of the
Aleutian group. They are most abundant and extensive in the
islands east of Unalashka, and on the few islands from Amchitka east-
ward, which are less high and rugged than the others, or on those
where the greater amount of level land is to be found. The two neces-
saries for a settlement appear to have been a stream of water or a
spring, and a oe where canoes could land with safety in rough

American Ethnology, I, 1877, p. 43.

762 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

weather. Where these are both wanting, shell heaps are never found,
and rarely when either is absent.”

From careful examinations made by Mr. Dall, he deems it proba-
ble that the islands ‘‘ were populated at a very distant period; that the
population entered the chain from the eastward; that they were, when
first settled on the islands, in a very different condition from that in
which they were found by the first civilized travelers,” etc. It is
furthermore suggested by this writer that there was a later wave of
population; that the former people ‘‘were more similar to the lowest
grades of Innuit (so-called Eskimo) than to the Aleuts of the historic
period,” and that the stratification of the shell heaps shows a tolerably
uniform division into three stages, characterized by the food which
formed their staple of subsistence and by the weapons for obtaining
as well as the utensils for preparing the food.

The stages are—

I. The littoral period, represented by the Echinus layer.

Il. The fishing period, represented by the Fishbone layer.

III. The hunting period, represented by the Mammalian layer.

In concluding his impressions respecting the shell heaps, the author
concludes by saying “that those strata correspond approximately to
actual stages in the development of the population which formed them,
so that their contents may approximately, within limits, be taken as
indicative of the condition of that population at the times when the
respective strata were being deposited.”

PREHISTORIC ART.

With reference to specimens of art or ornament, Mr. Dall! remarks:
if ;

The expression of esthetic feeling, as indicated by attempts at ornamentation of
utensils or weapons or by the fabrication of articles which serve only for purposes
of adornment, is remarkably absent in the contents of the shell heaps. Asa whole,
this feeling became developed only at the period directly anterior to the historic
period. It was doubtless exhibited in numerous ways, of which no preservation
was possible, so that the early record, even for a considerable period, would be very
incomplete. We know that great taste and delicate handiwork were expended on
articles of clothing and manufactures of grass fiber, which would be entirely
destroyed in the shell heaps, and of which only fragmentary remains have been
preserved on the mummies found in the latest prehistoric burial caves and rock
shelters.; *) * *

There are some articles used on the kyak which are usually made of bone, and
often preserved in the upper mammalian stratum, and upon which some attempts at
ornamentation were bestowed. These are little pieces of bone or ivory, in general
shape resembling a kneeling figure, with one or two holes, through which cords are
passed. ~ * * The latter were in some cases carved to represent figures of ani-
mals. Another species of ornamentation is elsewhere alluded to in the flat thin
strips of bone which were fastened to the wooden visor worn in hunting. These
were frequently ornamented with typically Innuit patterns of parallel lines, dots,
concentric circles, with zigzag markings between them and radiating lines. All

these were in black, on the white basis of the bone or ivory. * * * The mark-
ings can seldom be accurately described as marks of ownership. I have never seen
any definite mark or ornament of this nature among the Aleuts or Western Innuits.
They readily recognize their own utensils or weapons without any such aid, and I
believe the theory of ‘‘marks of ownership,” ‘‘ batons of command,” and such like,
has been stretched far beyond the point of endurance or accuracy, at least among
writers on the Innuit. Drawings, engravings on bone or wood, and pictures of any
kind, so far as I have observed, are all subsequent to the period covered by the
shell heap deposit. They are invariably quite modern, though the taste for them
is now widely spread among the Innuit, especially those of the regions where ivory
is readily procured. The coloration of wooden articles with native pigments is of
ancient origin, but all the more elaborate instances that have come to my knowledge
have marks of comparatively recent origin.

ESKIMO AND CAVE MEN OF FRANCE.

In his “Alaska and its Resources,” Mr. Dall presents several illus-
trations of drawings on bone, very ordinary specimens and limited
to poorly executed figures of men hunting. These are given merely
to indicate to the reader the general appearance of the etching of the
Eskimo. It is related in this connection, however, that these drawings
are analogous to those discovered in France in the caves of Dordogne.
The numerous specimens of prehistoric art, both incised and carved,
which have been given by Messrs. Lartet and Christy in their work
entitled Reliquiz Aquitanice,! are familiar to most archeologists, so
that no reproduction of plates or illustrations is deemed necessary in
the present instance.

Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins,’ an acknowledged authority on the antiquity
of man in Europe, remarks at length upon the possible and in fact
probable identification between the cave men and the Eskimo. In his
conclusions upon comparisons between the respective arts, forms of
weapons, apparently similar modes of living, ete., he says:

On passing in review the manners and customs of all the savage tribes known to
modern ethnology, there is only one people with whom the cave men are intimately
connected in their manners and customs, in their art, and in their ¥nplements and
weapons. The Eskimo range at the present time from Greenland on the east along
the shores of the Arctic Sea as far to the west as the Straits of Bering, inhabiting a
narrow littoral strip of country, and living by hunting, fishing, and fowling. The
most astonishing bond of union between the cave men and the Eskimo is the art of
representing animals. Just as the former engraved bisons, horses, mammoths, and
other creatures familiar to them, so do the latter represent the animals upon which
they depend for food. On the implements of the one you see the hunting of the urus
and the horse depicted in the same way as the killing of the reindeer and walrus on
the implements of the other. * * * All these points of connection between the
cave men and the Eskimo can, in my opinion, be explained only on the hypothesis
that they belong to the same race. To the objection that savage tribes living under
the same conditions might independently invent the same implements, and that
therefore the correspondence in the question does not necessarily imply a unity of
race, the answer may be made that there are no savage tribes known which use the
same set of implements without being connected by blood. The ruder and more

‘London, 1875, pp. 204. P1.87. Three maps and 132 woodcuts. Quarto.

764 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

common instruments, such as flakes, and in a lesser degree scrapers, are of little value
in classification; but where a whole set agrees, intended for various use, and some of
them rising above the most common wants of savage life, the argument as to race is
of considerable weight. It is still further strengthened by the identity of art. The
articles found in the caves of Britain, Belgium, France, or Switzerland differ scarcely
more from those used in west Georgia than the latter from those of Greenland or
Melville Peninsula.

From these considerations it may be gathered that the Eskimos are probably the
representatives of the cave men, and protected within the Arctic Circle from those
causes by which they have been driven from Europe and Asia. They stand at the
present day wholly apart from all other living races, and are cut off from all both
by the philologer and the craniologist. Unaccustomed to war themselves, they were
probably driven from Europe and Asia by other tribes in the same manner as within
the last century they have been driven farther north by the attacks of the Red
Indian.

The theory that the peoples of the cirecumpolar regions might be the
descendants of the ancient cave dwellers of France has been enter-
tained not only by Mr. Dawkins. Among other arguments employed
are (1) the apparent similarity of environment, and that as the south-
ernmost margins of the receding ice, in glacial times, slowly moved
northward, the ancient cave people continued their migration in that
direction until their present location was reached; (2) the general
resemblance in the caryed weapons and utensils of reindeer horn, and
also some of the portrayals of animal forms which occur thereon.

From evidence based upon investigations by Doctor Rink, and the
archieologic indications noted by Mr. Dall and others, the Eskimo
are believed to have become a littoral people in America by expulsion
from some interior regions of North America, such expulsion having
been brought about through the northward expansion of the Athabas-
can tribes toward the northwest and the Algonkian tribes toward the
northeast. Even within historic times the Eskimo occupied a much
more extensive coast line southward on the Atlantic than at present,
and it is impossible to conjecture what may not have been the southern
limits, in préhistoric times, with reference to the first theory above
named.

It is believed by some geologists that as the glaciers of western
Europe gradually receded, the direction of migration of the prehistoric¢
people was toward the British Isles, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and
Lapland. The theory of their passage across to Greenland does not
appear to be supported by any prehistoric remains, such as one would
hope to discover after the recovery of the great amount of excellent
material indicating a peculiar advancement in the arts of fashioning
weapons and utensils of ivory and horn. Neither does there survive
anything in Greenland but the simplest type of artistic decoration on
ivory or bone, such as lines, dots, ete., which is characteristic of the
Eskimo everywhere, excepting in Alaska, where the greater develop-
ment was due to other causes, which will be mentioned farther on.

Neither is there apparent evidence that the Eskimo came across
Bering Strait, as the survivors of the ancient cave men of Europe.

With regard to the second theory, it would be strange indeed if
there were not some general similarities between the weapons and
utensils of two distinct uncivilized peoples when both used the same
materials—reindeer horn—for such articles; and, furthermore, the
attempted portrayal of animals of like genera would naturally produce
results of very general likeness.

Finally, it has been suggested, and the burden of proof appears to
indicate, that the development of pictographie art among the Alaskan
Eskimo was attributable to their contact with the Russians; and that,
although these natives preserved a limited degree of culture as to
decorating by simple lines and dots their weapons and a few other arti-
cles of daily use, yet the objective representation of any animate or
other forms is believed to have been adopted since the earliest visits of
civilized man to the Alaskan Coast.

Several Alaskan utensils, however, used as arrow and spear straight-
eners are here illustrated in plate 7, figs. 1, 2, and 3, and plate 8, figs.
2and 3, and are apparently similar to some like remains from the caves
of France figured by Messrs. Lartet and Christy.

Upon closer examination it will be observed that besides the simi-
larity of form, due chiefly to the reason that both types are of similar
materials, the representation of animal forms by engraving, or incision,
appears to belong to a different school of artistic work, if such a term
may here be employed; a “sketchy” outline of an animal frequently
consisting of but a few suggestive incisions here and there, as in very
modern nineteenth century art work, producing an effect in several
instances as the reindeer figured by Lartet and Christy in their work
before cited, which artistic products appear “too artistic” for the
culture status of cave men such as are portrayed in the deductions of
the gentlemen above quoted by W. Boyd Dawkins and others who
have followed np the same theme. The work of the cave men is appar-
ently vastly superior in one respect to that of the Eskimo, and again
from another aspect inferior to it—inferior in various ways, as will be
learned by a perusal of the results attained by the Eskimo in the rep-
resentation of both objective and subjective ideas, as well as an
advancement toward conventionalization beyond that practiced by peo-
ples who are apparently further advanced in other respects.

ENVIRONMENT.

So many narratives relating to the life and social conditions of the
Eskimo, as well as to the topographic peculiarities of the countries
occupied by the various subdivisions of this people, have been pub-
lished at various times and by various authorities, that anything
further in this connection would be superfluous, especially in a paper
devoted more particularly to the graphie arts.

The habitations and clothing, such as are required in an unusually
inhospitable climate, are both illustrated in the native pictography.
766 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The forms of habitations are more particularly referred to elsewhere,
and various native representations are reproduced for the sake of com-
parison both as to artistic merit as well as indicating personal or tribal
variations dependent on climatic requirements.

The styles of clothing are not often referred to in Eskimo etchings,
tattooing and labrets being sometimes indicated in carvings, as well
as in incised characters. Some interesting carvings, with delicate
artistic touches to accentuate the effects of tattooing, are given else-
where. ;

ORNAMENTS AND LABRETS.

In some of the etchings are portrayed the outlines of human figures—
in various attitudes, though especially as if in the act of dancing—to the
rear portion of the body of which are attached little tail-like append-
ages resembling tails of animals.

This may be explained by quoting Captain Beechey,' as in his refer-
ence to the natives found northward of Cape Prince of Wales, within
43 miles of Schismareff Inlet, he states that, in addition to certain
described articles of clothing, “‘they have breeches and boots, the
former made of deer’s hide, the latter of seal’s skin, both of which
have drawing strings at the upper part made of seahorse hide. To
the end of that which goes round the waist they attach a tuft of hair,
the wing of a bird, or sometimes a fox’s tail, which, dangling behind
as they walk, gives them a ridiculous appearance, and may probably
have occasioned the report of the Tschutschi, recorded in Muller, that
the people of this country have ‘tails like dogs.’”

Among the trimmings and ornaments attached to the clothing the
Point Barrow Eskimo? also attach at the back the tail of an animal,
usually a wolverine’s. ‘Very seldom a wolf’s tail is worn, but nearly
all, even the boys, have wolverine tails, which are always saved for this
purpose and used for no other. The habit among the Eskimo of western
America of wearing a tail at the girdle has been noticed by many
travelers, and prevails at least as far as the Anderson River,” where it
was noticed by Father Petitot, who, in describing the dress of the
“chief,” remarks ‘“‘par derriére il portait aux reins une queue épaisse
et ondoyante de renard noir.” °

Captain Beechey'* first observed lip ornaments at Schismaeff Inlet, a
Short distance north of Cape Prince of Wales, and thence northward
to Point Barrow, seemingly a common practice along this coast. ‘These

‘ornaments consist of pieces of ivory, stone, or glass, formed with a
double head, like a sleeve button, one part of which is thrust through
a hole bored in the under lip. Two of these holes are cut in a slanting
direction about half an inch below the corners of the mouth. The

incision is made when about the age of puberty, and is at first the size
of a quill. As they grow older, the natives enlarge the orifice, and
increase the size of the ornament accordingly, that it may hold its
place. In adults this orifice is about half an inch in diameter, and will,
if required, distend to three-quarters of an inch.” The same practice
in every respect is also observed at Chamisso Island,! a short distance
from the above locality, and further reference concerning the natives is
quoted from the same authority as follows: “They readily disengaged
these lip ornaments from their lips, sold them, without minding the
least inconvenience of the saliva that flowed through the badly cica-
triced orifice over the chin; but rather laughed when some of us
betrayed disgust at the spectacle, thrusting their tongues through the
hole and winking their eyes.”

ART FACILITY.

Mr. Alfred C. Haddon, in his admirable work on “ Evolution in Art,”?
remarks of the early methods of conveying information between one
man and another, where oral or gesture language are impossible, that
pictorial delineation must be resorted to; and further, that ‘‘ probably
one of the earliest of this needs was that of indicating ownership, and
it may be that many devices in primitive implements and utensils have
this as one reason for their existence, although the nature of the orna-
mentation may be owing to quite a different reason.”

It is not of rare occurrence to find upon the arrows and other pos-
sessions of our native Indian tribes various marks by means of which
individual property may be identified; and among some of the pueblo
Indians decorated pottery bears “maker’s marks” in such manner that,
although the tribe at large may not recognize the maker of any par-
ticular decorated vessel, yet such a specimen will at once be identified
as originating in, or with, a certain family, and when application is
made at the designated abode, the individual will there be pointed
out, or named if absent.

It seems possible that the various markings upon the weapons from
the Alaskan shell heaps may have served as “‘ property marks,” and it
would appear, also, to have been found expedient for the native sea-
going hunters to devise and adopt some sort of a system by means of
which they might be enabled to identify and recover any stray or float-
ing weapon, or the animal in which such weapon might be found, or
possibly both.

Mr. Haddon remarks that “the beautifying of any object is due to
impulses which are common to all men, and have existed as far back as
the period when men inhabited caves and hunted the reindeer and
mammoth in western Europe.”* Apparently the oldest markings thus

768 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

used consisted of simple lines and punctures or perforations, such as
are found at present among the Greenland and Labrador Eskimo,
though among the latter small carvings are also beginning to be more
abundant.

In his reference to the Kaniags, Mr. Ivan Petroff' says they use
whale spears about 6 feet in length, armed with slate points. ‘ Upon
the point of his spear each hunter carves his mark to enable him to
claim his quarry.”

Mr. L. M. Turner informs me that Eskimo property marks are unknown
to him, although each hunter, or maker of weapons, will recognize his
own workmanship, as well as that of others, by different peculiarities
of individual skill. Among the sea-otter hunters of the Aleuts, they
do have marks by which the detachable point of the otter spear may
be known. “This point is often copper, obtained from copper bolts from
a Russian vessel long ago stranded on their shore; and as the spear is
made with exquisite skill, the point is also delicate and of particular
form, so that a difficulty would arise as to whose spear point strikes
nearest the nose of the creature. In its struggles the point is torn
loose from the strong, yet slender, sinew line holding it to the spear.
Another thrower may succeed in striking it and capture the otter, but
he whose point is nearest the nose may claim the skin. <A fair degree
of liberality is usually manifested in such instances.”

The residence in Point Barrow of Mr. Murdoch—extending over a
period of perhaps three years—aftorded him ample opportunity to study
the art of the Eskimo of that northernmost extremity of Alaska. In
his report before mentioned he remarks:

The artistic sense appears to be much more highly developed among the western
Eskimo than among those of the east. Among the latter, decoration appears to be
applied almost solely to the clothing, while tools and utensils are usually left plain,
and if ornamented are only adorned with carving or incised lines. West of the
Mackenzie River, and especially south of Bering Strait, Eskimo decorative art
reaches its highest development, as shown by the collections in the National Museum.
Not only is everything finished with the utmost care, but all wooden objects are
gaily painted with various pigments, and all articles of bone and ivory are covered
with ornamental carvings and incised lines forming conventional patterns.

There are in the collections also many objects that appear to have been made
simply for the pleasure of exercising the ingenuity in representing natural or fanci-
ful objects, and are thus purely works of art. * * * As would naturally be
expected, art at Point Barrow occupies a somewhat intermediate position between
the highly developed art of the southwest and the simpler art of the east. * * *
It will be noticed that whenever the bone or ivory parts of weapons are decorated,
the ornamentation is usnally in the form of incised lines colored with red ocher or
soot. These lines rarely represent any natural objects, but generally form rather
elegant conventional patterns, most commouly doable or single borders, often joined
by oblique cross lines or fringed with short pointed parallel lines. * * *

The only decorative work in metal is to be seen in the pipes and their accompany-
ing picks and fire steel. * * *

Mr. Dall remarks that the forms in general of the Eskimo are very
much alike throughout the entire area occupied by this people; but he
continues in another place, ‘ Similar drawings are common everywhere
among the Innuit, while I have never seen among the Tenneh tribes of
the northwest any similar specimens of art.” !

Since the time of Mr. Dall’s researches in Alaska, however, vari-
ous specimens of Thlinkit art designs have been received by the
National Museum. Several of these, consisting of neck ornaments, are
reproduced in plate 9, figs. 1 to 6, and bear purely Eskimo forms of
ornamentation obtained through the medium of intertribal traffic, to
waich other reference is made in connection with trade routes or culture

/eoutes.
ff - The ornamentation of utensils, articles of personal adornment, and of
weapons is limited among the Eskimo eastward of Alaska to lines and
dots in various combinations. Carvings occur also, small figures, both
flat and in imitation of the animals with which the artist is familiar.
The engraving upon ivory and bone for the purpose of recording hunt-
ing, fishing, and other exploits and pursuits, appears to be entirely
absent in the east, being confined to the natives of Alaska, the Siberian
Eskimo—the Yuit—and recently copied by other neighboring peoples.

In the vicinity of Chamisso Island, a short distance above Cape
Prince of Wales, Captain Beechey” found various kinds of utensils,
weapons, and other manufactures of the natives, upon some of which
were engraved various objects, to which he refers as follows:

On the outside of this and other instruments there were etched a variety of figures
of men, beasts, birds, etc., with a truth and character which showed the art to be
common among them. The reindeer were generally in herds. In one picture they
were pursued by a man in a stooping posture in snowshoes; in another he had
approached nearer to his game, and was in the act of drawing his bow. A third
represented the manner of taking seals with an inflated skin of the same animal as
a decoy; it was placed upon the ice, and not far from it was a man lying upon his
belly with a harpoon ready to strike the animal when it should make its appearance.
Another was dragging a seal home upon a small sledge; and several baidars were
employed harpooning whales which had been previously shot with arrows; and thus,
by comparing one with another, a little history was obtained which gave us a better
insight into their habits than could be elicited from any signs or imitations.

Mr. John Murdoch,’ in quoting Mr. L. M. Turner that the natives of
Norton Sound keep a regular record of hunting and other events
engraved upon drill bows, remarks that ‘we did not learn definitely
that such was the rule at Point Barrow, but we have one bag handle
marked with whales, which we were told indicated the number killed by
the owner.” Several specimens are then referred to as having figures
incised upon them, colored both in red or in black, together with very
small illustrations of the bow, upon which the figures are so greatly

reduced as to be of no value in the study of pictographic representa-
tion of objects, ideas, or gestures. ;
Mr. Murdoch! remarks furthermore:

The only thing that we saw of the nature of numerical records were the series of
animals engraved upon ivory, already alluded to. In most cases we were unable to
learn whether the figures really represented an actual record or not, though the bag
handle already figured was said to contain the actual score of whales killed by old
Yivksina. The custom does not appear to be so prevalent as at Norton Sound, * * *
With one exception they only record the capture of whales or reindeer. The excep-
tion * * * presents a series of ten bearded seals. The reindeer are usually
depicted in a natural attitude, and some of the circumstances of the hunt are usually
represented. For instance, a man is figured aiming with a bow and arrow toward a
line of reindeer, indicating that such a number were taken by shooting, while a

string of deer, represented without legs as they would appear swimming, followed.

by arude figure of a man in a kaiak, means that so many were lanced in the water.
Other incidents of the excursion are also sometimes represented. On these records
the whole is always represented by a rude figure of the tail cut off at the ‘‘small,”
and often represented as hanging from a horizontal line,

We also brought home four engraved pieces of ivory, which are nothing else than
records of real or imaginary scenes.

The above remarks, with the description of the four specimens else-
where reproduced, comprise about all the attention that this interesting
subject appears to have received during a three years’ residence at
Point Barrow among natives who surpass almost any other peoples in
North America in the graphic arts.

It is fortunate that the National Museum has in its possession the
rich collections made by Messrs. Nelson and Turner, both of whom
appreciated the value of such material and availed themselves of the
opportunity of securing it, as well as information pertaining to the
interpretation of many of the pictographic ideas shown.

In his medical and anthropological notes relating to the natives of
Alaska, Doctor Irving C. Rosse? remarks:

Some I have met with show a degree of intelligence and appreciation in regard to
charts and pictures scarcely to be expected from such a source. From walrus ivory
they sculpture figures of birds, quadrupeds, marine animals, and even the human
form, which display considerable individuality notwithstanding their crude delinea-
tion and imperfect detail, * * * Evidences of decoration are sometimes seen on
their canoes, on which are found rude pictures of walruses, ete., and they have a
kind of picture writing by means of which they commemorate certain events in

their lives, just as Sitting Bull has done in an autobiography that may be seen at the
Army Medical Museum.

When we were searching for the missing whales off the Siberian coast, some
natives were come across with whom we were unable to communicate except by
signs, and wishing to Jet them know the object of our visit, a ship was drawn in i
notebook and shown to them with accompanying gesticulations, which they quickly
comprehended, and one fellow, taking the pencil and note book, drew correctly a pair

of reindeer horses on the ship’s jib hoom—a fact which identified beyond doubt the
derelict vessel they had seen. * * *

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 771

The above-named author furthermore refers to natives making pencil
and pen-and-ink sketches, one in particular having taught himself by
copying from the “ Illustrated London News.” These sketches, ‘‘ though
creditable in many respects, had the defects of many Chinese pictures,
being faulty in perspective.” Doctor Rosse concludes by saying:

As these drawings equal those in Doctor Rink’s book, done by Greenland artists, 1
regret my inability to reproduce them here. As evidences of culture, they show
more advancement than the carvings of English rustics that a clergyman has caused
to be placed on exhibition at the Kensington Museum.

Doctor Henry Rink! says:

The art exhibited by the Alaska Eskimo in ornamenting their weapons and uten-

sils is often mentioned in travelers’ reports from the time when they were first
visited by Europeans. To their skill in carving and engraving, we must join this
taste displayed in the same way in making their clothing. Again, when we pass
from Alaska to the east, we see this relish for the fine arts declining, and in western
Greenland proofs of it have been rather scarce. But the latest expedition to the
east coast of this country has discovered that a small isolated tribe here in the vast
deserts of the extreme east almost rivals the Alaska artists with respect to carving
in bone and ornamenting their weapons and utensils. The chief difference is, that
in Alaska, engravings illustrating human life and the animals of the country are the
most popular objects of the artist, whereas the east Greenlanders excel in small
reliefs representing for the most part animals and mythological beings grouped
together and fastened with admirable taste and care to the surface of the wooden
implements.

With reference to the arts of the Eskimo of Greenland, Doctor
Henry Rink? remarks:

Tt must be noticed that though the present Greenlanders appear to have a pretty
fair talent for drawing and writing, scarcely any traces of the arts of drawing and
sculpture belonging to earlier times remain, with the exception of a few small
images cut out in wood or bone, which have probably served children as play-
things. The western Eskimo, on the other hand, displayed great skill in carving
bone ornaments, principally on weapons and tools.

Drawings made by Greenland Eskimo for Doctor Rink greatly
resemble the American schoolboys’ efforts. A recent production of
precisely like character in almost every respect is from the island of
Kolguey, and reproduced herewith in plate, together with the following
explanation:

Some interesting illustrations of Samoyed drawings are given by Mr.
Aubyn Trevor-Battye in his “Ice-bound on Kolguev,” Westminster,
1895. Kolguev Island lies 50 miles north of Arctic Europe, and is sep-
arated from the continent by what is known as Barent’s Sea. It is
abeut midway, in distance, between Waygat Island—immediately scuth
of Novaya Zemblya—and the eastern extremity of Lapland. The
Samoyeds here are entirely isolated, from the fact that they possess no
boats that could venture 50 miles across the sea—an interesting cir-

cumstance, because they are often, from various supposed or accidental
similarities in customs and manners, coupled with the Eskimo, a people
with whom the kayak and umiak are the chief methods of transportation.

The illustrations represent ordinary pursuits, and appear to be made
upon paper by means of a pencil. The peculiarities of drawing are
very much of the same character as the Eskimo sketches obtained by
Doctor Rink in Greenland. One example will suffice. Plate 10 repre-
sents Samoyeds killing walrus. The black dots on the right are heads
of seals, at which a man, lying flat upon the ice, appears to be shooting.
The hunter appears as if placed in the air, though in reality the view
seems to be from above—as a bird’s-eye view—the figure of the man
corresponding, in this particular, to like portrayals in several Eskimo
engravings on ivory, from Alaska.

Captain Parry mentions having charts made by the natives of Winter
Island. A first attempt made ‘was by placing several sheets of paper
before Iliglink, and roughly drawing on a large scale an outline of the
land about Repulse Bay and Lyon Inlet, and terminating at our present
winter quarters. * * * Tliglink was not long in comprehending
what we desired, and with a pencil continued the outline, making the
land trend, as we supposed, to the northeastward. The scale being
large, it was necessary when she came to the end of one piece of paper
to tack on another, till at length she had filled ten or twelve sheets, and
had completely lost sight of Winter Island * * * at the other end
of the table. The idea entertained from this first attempt was that we
should find the coast indented by several inlets, and in some parts
much loaded with ice, especially at one strait to the northward of her
native island, Amitioke, which seemed to lead in a direction very much
to the westward. Within a week after this, several other charts were
drawn by the natives in a similar way. * * * The coast was here
delineated as before, on a very large scale, but much more in detail,
many more islands, bays, and names being inserted. It was observ-
able, however, that no two charts much resembled each other, and that
the greater number of them still less resembled the truth in those parts
of the coast with which we were well acquainted.” !

An interesting illustration of a Greenland map made by natives of
the east coast is given by Mr. G. Holm in his Ethnographic Sketch of
Angmagsalikerne.” This consists of three blocks of wood, along the
edges of which are cut various indentations and curves, leaving pro-
jections, all of which are intended to portray the contour of the shore
lines between various important points on the east shore of Greenland.
Channels, capes, islands, and other topographic features are apparently
well reproduced, at least sufficiently clear to permit of their identifica-
tion when compared with a large chart of the locality referred to.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. Us

Mr. Alfred C. Hadden! says:

All human handiwork is subject to the same operation of external forces, but the
material on which these forces act is also infinitely varied. The diverse races and
people of mankind have different ideas and ideals, unequal skill, varied material to
work upon, and dissimilar tools to work with. Everywhere the environment is
dutterenttsogis a uk

The conclusion that forced itself upon me is that the decorative art of a people
does to a certain extent reflect their character. A poor, miserable people have poor
and miserable art. Kyven among savages leisure from the cares of life is essential for
the culture of art. It is too often supposed that all savages are lazy and have an
abundance of spare time, but this is by no means always the case. Savages do all
that is necessary for life; anything extra is for excitement, sesthetics, or religion;
and even if there is abundance of time for these latter, it does not follow that there
is an equivalent superfluity of energy.

The Eskimo are a peculiarly lively people, and keenly appreciate any-
thing ludicrous. Contrary to the Indian generally, they can enjoy a
practical joke without thought of resenting such if personal. Such
a condition, especially when there is an abundance of food, so that
unoccupied time may be utilized for social enjoyment, is one which is
apt to foster pursuits that lend gratification and pleasure to the sight
and stimulate artistic tendencies. Shamanism prevails extensively and
ceremonials are frequent; and apart from this there are numberless
individual instances where natives consult the shaman for success in
almost every avocation, and also for the exorcism of demons from the
body of the sick, and for “ hunter’s medicine,” i. e., securing the help
of a shaman that game may be directed in the way of the hunter. It
is but reasonable to presume, therefore, that the superstitions and cult
beliefs should, to a certain degree, manifest themselves in the art, as
well as to be the means of developing a symbolism similar in degree to
that found among other peoples living under similar conditions and
surrounded by like environment.

The possible introduction into western Alaska of articles of foreign
art or workmanship may thus have had but little influence upon the
native Eskimo in adopting new designs and patterns, with which he
was unfamiliar and the signification of which he did not comprehend,
but it may have suggested to him a simplification of approaching forms
with which he may already have been familiar.

MATERIALS EMPLOYED.
IVORY.

The material generally used by the Eskimo of Alaska is walrus ivory.
This is both durable and sufficiently hard to retain indefinitely, with
proper care, the most delicate etchings. Its white or cream tint forms
a delicate background for any colored incisions, and in instances where
from age or otherwise the material attains a yellow or orange tint, the
black etching-like pictographs are really improved in appearance.

1“<¥Evolution in Art.” London, 1895, pp. 7-9.
774 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The animal which furnishes this material is represented in Plate 11,
the speciinen technically known as Rosmarus obesus, liger, being most
abundant in Bristol Bay.

The walrus tusks are capable of softening and bending, according to
Captain Herendeen, a gentleman of considerable experience in the
region under discussion. The tusks are divided longitudinally, one
tusk usually furnishing four rods, either by sawing or scraping and split-
ting. The process described below by Mr. Lucian M. Turner, as pur-
sued in former times and with primitive tools, is still practically the
same, though accomplished with modern tools purchased at the traders’
or obtained from whalers.

During his protracted residence in southern Alaska, Mr. Turner
studied carefully the customs of the Eskimo, and for special instruction
in some of the arts the natives worked in his presence, thus affording
every opportunity desired.

In response to my inquiry regarding the primitive methods of pre-
paring the ivory drill bows, and their subsequent engraving with
pictographs, the following communication was kindly sent to me by
Mr. Turner.! He says:

The abundance of walrus ivory in the days prior to the advent of Americans (the
Russians did not encourage the use of firearms by the natives and stringently pro-
hibited the sale of such weapons except in greatly favored instances) permitted the
Innuit to secure the best character of ivory when wanted; hence the selection of a
tusk depended entirely upon the want or use to which it was to be applied. Later
the best tusks were sold and the inferior qualities retained, as is well shown by the
comparison of the older and the more recent implements created from that material.

The tusk selected was rudely scratched with a fragment of quartz, or other sili-
ceous stone, along the length of the tusk until the sharp edge would no longer deepen
the groove; the other three sides were scratched or channeled until the pieces of
tusk could be separated. Sometimes this was done by pressure of the hand, or
effected by means of a knifeblade-shaped piece of wood, on which was struck a sharp
blow, and so skillfully dealt as not to shatter or fracture the piece intended for use.
The other side, or slabs, were removed in a similar manner.

The piece intended for drill bow or other use was now scraped (rubbed) with a
fragment of freshly broken basalt, in which the cavities formed additional cutting
edges and aided in the collection of the bone dust. When this was explained to me,
I suggested the use of water, but the native (Innuit) smiled and continued his
work. I soon saw he knew better than I how to reduce the size of a strip of walrus
ivory. This attrition of the surface was continued until the approximate size was
reached. The holes or perforations in the ends were produced by means of stone
drills after a depression had been made by an angular piece of stone, any stone
capable of wearing away the ivory substance. A few grains of sand were put into
the shallow cavity and the stone drill started by means of another drill or by a
string or thong similar to the manner in making fire.

Various sizes of stone drills were made, and by their use the different holes were
produced. It is unusual to find two perforations of the same diameter in any object.
These stone drills were used in making the long holes in ivory objects of all kinds.

The final smoothing of the surface of the ivory piece was effected by rubbing it
against a fine-grained stone or in the hand where fine sand was held; lastly, two
pieces of ivory were rubbed against each other and thus a polished surface produced.

‘Letter dated December 26, 1894.

PLATE 11.

WALRUS. (Rosmarus obesus, lliger.)
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. U15

The etching was done with sharp edges of fragments of flint. Sometimes these
stone fragments were skillfully fastened into a piece of wood and used as gravers or
even as lancets. In later years files and saws were used to cut the ivory into the
required shape, and pieces of steel were used to make the holes. Often a three-
cornered file was the instrument used to make the holes.

The drill bow or other implement or utensil was not produced in a day or even ina
month, as these articles were usually created for personal use. I have known of
such articles being taken along while on a protracted hunting expedition and there
worked upon to while away the oftentimes tedious hours of watching game. Again
I have known when a native had requested a friend to etch some design, and in their
festivals, commemorating their dead, these articles were often presented and highly
cherished as gifts. Other articles of ivory often passed as a legacy from a relative
to another, and highly valued by the owner.

With respect to the walrus ivory and antler, both of which are
employed by the engraver for the portrayal of various figutes, Mr.
Turner writes: !

You will observe many of the larger objects of ivory and antler have outer or
engraved portions of herder substance than the inner or core portion. You will per-
ceive that in bent or curved affairs the outer part is always the denser portion of
the material. This or these substances warp or curve because of their unequal
density of parts. The native saw that heat would unshape astraight piece of ivory
or antler, and, taking advantage of what the sun did, he laid aside the piece where
it would become moist, and then placed it before the fire, core next to the tire, and
warping was the result.

In the winter the heat of the sun was not sufficient to produce harm, but when the
warm rays began to heat objects, the native was careful to put his ivory or bone
implements of the chase in the shade of a house or on the side of his ey or within
a place where heat could not affect it.

I never saw them dip any such object in hot water or try to bend it by force.

The absence of graphic art among the Eskimo of Greenland, Labra-
dor, and the region between Hudson Bay and the Mackenzie River,
can not entirely be attributed to the lack of horn, bone, and walrus
ivory, aS one or more of these materials appear abundant in certain
localities. By graphic art as here named is not intended the ordinary
ornamentation by means of lines, dots, etc., nor the sketches on paper

referred to by Doctor Rink, but the etching 2s upon the several materials

by means of gravers, to ono graphically records of hunting expe-

ditions, shamanistic ceremonies, and other subjects of which numerous

examples are here given passim. The great supply of ivory in Alaska

comes from near Port Muller, in Bristol Bay, and the more northern

coast and islands. Mr. Dall, who is authority for this statement, adds, °
furthermore, “that the amount of walrus ivory taken annually will

average 100,000 pounds.” ?

Some of the utensils in the National Museum are made of fossil ivory ;
and of this to Mr. Dall remarks, ‘‘that it is not uncommon in many
parts of the valleys of the Yukon and Kuskoquim. It is usually found
on the surface, not buried as in Siberia, and all that I have seen has
been so much injured by the weather that it was of little commercial

value. It is usually blackened, split, and so fragile as to break readily
in pieces. It has also been found on the shores of Kotzebue Sound and
he Arctic coast.” ?

Captain William Edward Parry,’ during his second voyage oe the
discovery of a northwest passage, found the walrus in tolerable abun-
dance in latitude 68° 22’ 21” north, and longitude (by chronometer)
81° 56’ 55’ west, which places the locality on the east coast of Mel-
ville Peninsula. He remarks:

In the course of this day the walruses became more and more numerous every
hour, lying in large herds upon the loose pieces of drift ice; and it having fallen
calm at 1p. m., we dispatched our boats to endeavor to kill some for the sake of
the oil which they afford. On approaching the ice, our people found them huddled
close to, and even lying upon, one another, in separate droves of from twelve to
thirty, the whole number near the boats being perhaps about two hundred. Most
of them waited quietly to be fired at, and even after one or two discharges did not
seem to be greatly disturbed, but allowed the people to land on the ice near them,
and, when approached, showed an evident disposition to give battle. After they had
got into the water, three were struck with harpoons and killed from the boats.
When first wounded, they became quite furious, and one which had been struck
from Captain Lyon’s boat made a resolute attack upon her and injured several of
the planks with its enormous tusks.

The author above cited mentions, furthermore, the occurrence of
reindeer and musk ox, both species of animals furnished with horns
that might readily furnish excellent materials upon which to inscribe
pictorial representations of exploits or events. Great abundance of
the former are killed in the summer time, ‘partly by driving them
from islands or narrow necks of land into the sea, and then spearing
them from their canoes, and partly by shooting them from behind
heaps of stones raised for the purpose of watching them, and imitating
their peculiar bellow or grunt. Among the various artifices which they
employ for this purpose, one of the most ingenious consists in two men
walking directly from the deer they wish to kill, when the animal
almost always follows them. As soon as they arrive at a large stone,
one of the men hides behind it with his bow, while the other, continuing
to walk on, soon leads the deer within range of his companion’s arrows.
They are also very careful to keep to leeward of the deer, and will
scarcely go out after them at all when the weather is calm.”?

HORN.

Quite a number of specimens of Eskimo workmanship, upon which
both simple forms of ornamentation and pictographiec records occur,
consist of pieces of reindeer horn, obtained from the Barren-ground
caribou or reindeer, shaped into the form desired for the purpose. In

tarandus caribou Kerr), a variety found farther south than the Barren-
ground variety, which is believed to be the one best known to the
Alaskan Eskimo. Several utensils employed in net weaving are shown
in plate 13, figs. 1, 2, 3, and several short, stout slabs of horn, neatly
ornamented with animals and short records of hunting exploits, are
represented in plate 14, figs. 2-7.

No specimens of horn of either the mountain sheep or the mountain
goat, both of which are employed by various other and more southern
coast tribes, have as yet been found in the collection of either the
National Museum, or that of the Alaska Commercial Company, in San
Francisco, California.

BONE.

Another article very often met with, inscribed with various kinds of
ornamentation and pictorial work, consists of bone, both the larger
bones of the legs and ribs of reindeer, and the humerus of the swan,
the latter serving as tubes for needle cases or snuff tubes. Specimens
are Shown farther on.

A small piece of bone, rudely incised, is shown herewith in plate 14,
1tfeaie Ie

Some ornamented bone knives will be referred to under the special
class of subjects to which the records pertain. Such weapons are
employed in skinning and sometimes in cutting up animals, and native
portrayals of such avocations are also reproduced in several illustra-
tions. The handles, and sometimes the blades of such knives, some
with steel blades used in working and fashioning the ivory rods and bag
handles, are decorated as in plate 15, fig. 1.

WOOD.

Wood is sometimes used for various articles, such as boxes for tobacco,
small utensils and tools, and women’s trinkets. These are frequently
incised, but the ornamentation is limited to simple figures composed of
straight lines, and perhaps dots.

In the country of the Magemuts—who inhabited the vicinity of Cape
Romanzoff and reach nearly to the mouth of the Yukon River—wood is
reported as very scarce, and is an article of trade.!

Wood is sometimes used for ornaments, masks, and toys, the surface
of which may be whitened, and upon this other designs are portrayed.
Such an instance is shown in plate 16, consisting of a dancing mask.

The Greenland map, before mentioned, may also be noted in this con-
nection. —

The only other examples in the collections of the National Museum
are from Point Barrow, and may here be reproduced, together with the
descriptions given by Mr. Murdoch:

This consists of a toy obtained in Point Barrow and deposited in the

passed the ends of a sinew cord. The specimen is about 3.5 inches in

has a similar border of red. The middle square, 1 inch across, is

tive corners of the tablet. The compartments thus formed are orna-

elevated and the other apparently so curved as to pretend to touch
himself, indicating that he is contemplating something or has performed
some deed; the third space contains the conventional figure of a
whale’s tail to indicate that animal, and in the remaining space, at the
bottom, is a whale with what appears to denote a float attached to a
‘harpoon line.

The other side of the tablet, that bearing the cord, has in the left-
hand space an animal probably intended to denote a wolf; the upper
panel has within it a deer, the horns being turned back, whereas to
denote the reindeer they would be turned forward; the next, like the
first, appears to be a wolf, while the fourth has two animals seated
upon their haunches, facing one another, after the manner of dogs,
although they appear to closely resemble the first and third, which are
believed to denote wolves, as before stated. ;

Fig. 3.

DANCING GORGET OF WOOD; FROM POINT BARROW..

An old and weatherworn mask from Point Barrow is shown in fig. 2.
It is made of spruce wood, and measures 74 inches in length. It is
peculiar in having the outer corners of the eyes somewhat depressed,
and in addition to the mustache and imperial has a broad ‘‘ whaleman’s
mask ” drawn with black lead across the eyes.

Mr. Murdoch! says of the specimen that ‘‘ this mask has been for a
long time fastened to an ornamented wooden gorget, and appeared to
have been exposed to the weather, perhaps at a cemetery. The string
is made of unusually stout sinew braid.”

A decorated gorget is shown in fig. 3. It is from Point Barrow, and
Mr. Murdoch? describes it thus:

It is made of spruce, is 18.5 inches long, and has two beckets of stout sinew braid,
one to go round the neck and the other round the body under the wearer's arms.

780 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The figures are all painted on the front face. In the middle is aman painted with red
ocher; all the rest of the figures are black and probably painted with soot. The
man with his arms outstretched stands on a large whale, represented as spouting.
He holds a small whale in each hand. At his right is a small cross-shaped object
which perhaps represents a bird, then a man facing toward the left and darting a
harpoon with both hands, and a bear facing to the left. On the left of the red man
are two umiaks with five men in each, a whale nearly effaced, and three of the crow-
shaped objects already mentioned. Below them also, freshly drawn with a hard,
blunt lead pencil or the point of a bullet, are a whale, an umiak, and a three- cornered
object the nature of which I can not make out.

A similar gorget, from the same place, is shown in fig. 4, and appears
to have been long exposed to the weather, perhaps at a cemetery, as
the figures are’all effaced except in the middle, where it was probably
“covered by a mask as in fig. 2, which was from the same village.”

big. 4.

DANCING GORGET OF WOOD; FROM POINT. BARROW.

Mr. Murdoch says of this that ‘‘there seems to have been a red bor
der on the serrated edge. In the middle is the same red man as before
standing on the black whale and holding a whale in each hand. At
his right is a black umiak with five men in it, and at his left a partially
effaced figure which is perhaps another boat.” The strings are for
securing the gorget to the dancer’s neck and body.

Mr. Murdoch! remarks of the human figure holding the whales:
“This man or giant, able to hold out a whale, appears to be a legend-
ary character, as we have his image carved in ivory. We unfortu-

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 781

nately did not succeed in learning anything more about him, except
that his name (apparently) was ‘ Kikamigo.’”

“These gorgets appear to have gone out of fashion,” continues the
above-named author, “‘as we saw none which were not very old, or
which appeared to have been used recently.” !

METALS.

Copper, brass, and white metal (consisting of block tin, lead, ete.), as
well as an occasional specimen of iron, will be met with bearing rude
designs in ornamentation. Very little is done also in silver, especially
in the manufacture of bracelets, an art which was imported from the
Thlinkit, who, in turn, obtained their first suggestions and patterns
from the Haida Indians. Mr. Murdoch reports the practice of engrav-
ing iron-pipe picks and flint steels at Point Barrow.

SKINS OF ANIMALS.

Tanned hides of walrus are sometimes used for purposes where a
touch here or there of ornamentation seems to be desired by the native
Eskimo.

reindeer skin and the small peltries used for articles of clothing are
sometimes decorated with designs in color by means of small wooden
tools resembling spoons, of which the back of the bowl is cut into pat-
terns, which are then moistened with the pigments or stains, and
finally impressed upon the skin or fabric. This process is very like
that practiced by the South Sea Islanders in decorating some forms of
tapa cloth.

TATTOOING.

The human skin is also used for the portrayal of various designs, the
practice of tattooing varying among the several tribes or bands of
Eskimo between Alaska and Greenland. Plate 4 represents a Port
Clarence girl with typical tattooing upon the chin. In the female the
designs are usually limited to such vertical bars upon the chin. On
Plate 22, fig. 7, is also shown tattooing by pictography upon a carved
face.

Referring to the Eskimo of Melville Peninsula, Captain Parry?
remarks:

Among their personal ornaments must also be reckoned that mode of marking the
body called tattooing, which, of the customs not essential to the comfort or happi-
ness of mankind, is perhaps the most extensively practiced throughout the world.
Among these people it seems to be an ornament of indispensable importance to the
women, not one of them being without it. The operation is performed about the age
ot ten or sometimes earlier and has nothing to do with marriage, except that, being
considered in the light of a personal charm, it may serve to recommend them as

wives. The parts of the body thus marked are their faces, arms, hands, thighs, and
in some few women the breasts, but never the feet, as in Greenland.

Atlantic to the Pacific. London, 1824.
782 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895. ’

The operation is very expeditiously managed by passing a needle and thread, the ~
latter covered with lamp black and oil, under the epidermis, according to a pattern
previously marked out upon the skin. Several sketches being thus taken at once,
the thumb is pressed upon the part, while the thread is drawn through, by which
means the coloring matter is retained and a permanent dye of a blue tinge imparted
to the skin.

In the absence of needles, says the author, a strip of whalebone is
used as a substitute. It is furthermore stated that the patterns “ are
nearly the same in all,” and that “a little of this kind of mark is on the
back part of their hands; and with them we understood it to be con-
sidered as a souvenir of some distant or deceased person who had
performed it.”

Marks of distinction by tattooing are employed by the men to denote
success in whaling. ‘Those men who are or have been captains of
whaling umiaks that have taken whales have marks tattooed some-
where on their person, sometimes forming a definite tally.”?

Mr. Murdoch refers to an example in the person of a native named
Anoru, who had a broad band tattooed across each cheek, extending
from the corner of the mouth backward toward the lobe of the ear.
These bands were made up of many indistinct lines, which were said
to indicate ‘*many whales.” Another instance was that of a native
who “had the ‘ flukes’ of seven whales in a line across the chest.”

The wife of the former ‘“‘had a little mark tattooed on each corner of
her mouth, which she said were ‘ whale marks,’ indicating that she was
the wife of a successful whaleman.” !

McClure notes that at Cape Bathurst he observed that a successful
harpooner had a blue line drawn across the bridge of the nose,’ and,
according to Armstrong, he has a line tattooed from the inner angle
of the eye across the cheek, a new one being added for every whale
he strikes.’ Father Petitot remarks that in this region whales are
“scored” by ‘tattooing crosses on the shoulder, and that a murderer
is marked across the nose with a couple of horizontal lines.”* It is
interesting, says Murdoch, that one of the “striped” men at Nuwik
told us he had killed a man. In east Greenland tattooing is similarly

INSTRUMENTS AND COLORS.

Various instruments are employed by the Eskimo in preparing for
the reception of pictographs the several substances used for that
purpose. The pigments are now chiefly obtained from the trader,

though in former times they were prepared from mineral and vegetable
substances.

Plate 17 represents two saws used in cutting ivory. The specimen
shown in fig. 1 is from Port Clarence, and appears to be made of a
piece of a steel saw of American manufacture, but from the appearance
of the specimen the teeth were filed into it by the native. It is
hafted to a piece of ivory and secured by means of a niece of metal.
apparently a nail.

Plate 17, fig. 2, represents a saw of a thinner piece of metal with a
very irregularly filed cutting edge. It is attached to a piece of ivory,
and was obtained at Anderson River. This instrument was used in
splitting walrus tusks lengthwise, as well as cutting them into shorter
pieces when necessary. In the bone or ivory comb represented in Plate
22, fig. 4, may be seen the effects of native sawing and an attempt to
make teeth.

Several forms of knives before referred to are illustrated in plate 15,
The upper left-hand figure (fig. 1) is a wood-working kuife, obtained at
St. Michaels, and sent to the Museum by Mr. KE. W. Neison. The handle
is made of a rib, a slot in the forward end being made there to receive
the laterally curved blade, and in this respect resembling to a limited
degree the type used by most of the Indians of the Great Lakes. The
blade is secured by means of a thong.

Upon the back or obverse side of the handle is a depression one-eighth
of an inch deep and five-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, which shows
ample evidence of having been used in holding a fire drill, or some other
variety of drill. Upon the front side of the handle appears the outlines
of three sailing vessels, immediately behind the right-hand figure being
a pit surrounded by a circle with four radiating lines, beyond which are
indications of an attempt to make other concentric circles.

These knives are used in fashioning wood into various forms, and
also, sometimes, in shaving the roughened edges of ivory rods.

The specimen at the upper right hand (fig. 2) is from Kotzebue Sound.
The handle, like the preceding, is made of a rib, while the arrow-shaped
piece of metal constituting the blade is secured by means of two rivets,
one of iron and one of copper, while the anterior, a third one, has fallen
out, leaving only the perforation.

The cutting edge is slightly concave from point to base and may
have been made so intentionally for the purpose of causing slight con-
vexity to the surface operated upon. This style of knife is also some-
times employed in shaving down ivory rods to the desired form and
thickness. ;

The third specimen (fig. 3) was obtained at Norton Sound. This bone
gouge or chisel represents the type of tool used for stripping off birch
bark for canoes before the iron tools were introduced. It is apparently
made of the leg bone of a reindeer and bears ornamentation of peculiar
interest. The transverse bars consist of parallel lines by twos, and
784 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

several times by threes, between which is the alternating dentate pat-

tern, the result of the interlacing, or alternate approximation, of points, —

the intervening surface resulting in a fine zigzag pattern. The simple
zigzag lines occur near the middle of the specimen, while the small lat-
eral ornaments resembling bird tracks are conventional tree patterns.

The incisions are all stained with what appears to be red ocher.
Total length is 12,°; inches; has a sharp cutting edge and shows evi-
dence of much use.

The ivory snow knife (fig. 4) was collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson at
the Chalitmut village, and occupies the bottom place on plate 15. The
specimen is 14} inches in length and 14% inches across the widest part
of the tolerably sharp blade. The bottom of the handle is ornamented
with seven projections representing seal heads, the eyes and mouth of
each being clearly cut and blackened. Along the top or back of the
blade are three parallel creases, crossed at intervals by short lines,
The upper edge of each side of the blade has two parallel iines extend-
ing from the base to near the tip, from the lower one of which extend
short < shaped ornaments resembling the legs on some of the Eskimo
mythic animals. The line, extending almost halfway along the bottom
edge of the blade, has single short lines projecting backward, at a slight
angle, atintervals of about half an inch apart. This is a simpler form
of ornament, though of the same type as that upon the upper side of
the blade.

Along the center, on either side, is a line terminating at the middle
of the blade in a circle within which is another and a central perfora-
tion filled with a hard wooden peg.

The central line on each side has simple, short, oblique lateral
incisions as ornaments, while the outer circle has lines radiating at the
cardinal points.

On plate 18 are reproduced three bone skin dressers, figs. 1 and 3
being obtained from the Thlingit Indians, while fig. 2 was secured at
Sitka, no specific tribe being referred to in the records accompanying
the object.

The ornamentation on plate 18, fig. 1 consists chiefly of three rows of
small squares being arranged in order to resemble a checkered surface,
the one series of squares being plain while the other is specified by
cross lines. At the upper edge, embracing a little more than one-third
of the surface, is a longitudinal surface marked by pairs of diagonal
lines.

The specimen on plate 18, fig. 2, has most of the surface of one side
divided off into three rectangles, all but one of the lines forming the
boundaries, being decorated on the inner side by broken series of small
triangles. This is a common Eskimo pattern, but has not the oppos-
ing fellow so as to form the zigzag. The pattern does not occur on
other specimens of like workmanship from the Thlingit Indians, or
from Sitka, excepting in the specimen on plate 46, fig. 3, in which two

short rows of triangular figures appear near the middle, while at the
left are three large triangular patterns placed so as to form a zigzag,
or V-shaped, design, this being merely an enlarged illustration of the
smaller patterns above noted. At the other end of this specimen is a
group of isolated transverse lines; from the middle of the end is
issuing a continuous horizontal line, 14 inches in length, terminating
in a bifurcation exactly resembling the common Eskimo conventional
tree pattern. In the middle space of the tool is a pair of parallel hori-
zontal lines, also terminating in similar bifurcations; this, however,
may be meaningless, though it resembles a doubletree symbol, or it
might also be taken as denoting a seine shuttle, examples of which
are given in several illustrations.
Mr. L. M. Turner writes:!

Circles are made with a graver; formerly a sharp corner of flint set in a stick.
* x * Jn Jater days a three-cornered file, one worn out, was substituted, and the
manner in which I saw him—an expert ivory worker at St. Michaels—use it was
simply pushing it from him, turning the ivory round as the circle was graved, a
little deeper at each turn.

The straight decorated lines were made as two deep channels at a suitable width
apart; the serrations were made by pushing from the outer edge of the ridge
toward the groove. ‘These sculptures are not made in a day, week, or month; many
objects are not completed in years, as many of them are life histories of the indi-
vidual. The Jnnuit is never in a hurry, and each thinks he has a lifetime before
him.

The Kaniags or Kaniaks, the inhabitants of the island of Kadiak
and surrounding islands, ‘‘ are possessed of great skill in carving
figures and other objects from walrus tusks, the material being
obtained from the Alaska Peninsula.” Mr. Ivan Petroff,? whose words
Tam quoting, remarks furthermore:

They also make very nicely carved snuffboxes of whalebone. Formerly all these
objects were worked with stone implements, but the use of iron has long been
known to the Kaniags, who used it at the arrival of the Russians. The savages
said that iron was occasionally cast upon the beach by the waves [sic!].

Reference has been made to the steel-pointed native-made gravers
used in various processes of engraving. In plate 19 are represented
five instruments, fig. 1 of which was obtained at Kotzebue Sound by
Mr. E. W. Nelson. The handle, a little over 5 inches in length, is
made of bone. A slight slot was cut at the large end, into which was
inserted a short piece of iron or steel, secured by wrapping with thin
cord, apparently of sinew. The point of the instrument is acute, and
admirably adapted for etching or scraping.

The second figure from the top (fig. 2) was secured at Anderson
River by Mr. Rk. McFarlane. The bone handle bears indentations, so as
to admit of secure grasping. The point of steel is inserted in the end

and filed down te a narrower width than that hidden from view. The
point measures ,* of an inch in height and is only about ;; of an inch

thick. The out edge is not at right angles to the sides, and thus

furnishes a better and sharper cutting edge.
The third or middle specimen (fig. 3) is from the same locality as the

preceding. The handle consists of two pieces of bone, so arranged as —

to unite smoothly and also to hold in place a piece of steel, which has
been sunk partly in each half of the handle by means of a slot made
by sawing. The two pieces are finally tied together with a sinew cord.
The apex of the graver is rather more acute than in the preceding
specimen.

The back of the tool is also ground to a cutting edge, to be used
in scraping smooth such surfaces requiring treatment previous to
engraving.

An interesting specimen occupies the fourth place in the series (fig.
4). This is from Port Clarence, where it was obtained by Mr. W. H.
Dall. The two pieces of bone composing the handle are secured to one
another by means of a peg passing vertically through them, and two
wooden pegs, of no special use apparently, are inserted in handle trans-
versely. Like in the preceding, a slot has been made with the front of
each piece so as to secure the flat piece of metal constituting the blade.
The point is neatly finished, and it will be observed has a very acute
tip turned downward so as to afford the best possible means for fine
engraving in hard material. The two pieces of handle are tied together
with a leather or skin thong. The entire length is 4% inches.

The fifth and lower specimen (fig 5) is from Cape Nome, and was
secured by Mr. E. W. Nelson. The handle is composed of two pieces
of walrus ivory; two pegs pass vertically through them to hold them
together, while the broad blade is, as usual, inserted in slots made in
both pieces of handle. The wrapping consists of sinew or hide, being
so covered with a layer of hard grease and dirt as to prevent identifica-
tion. The front edge of the instrument is at an angle sufficient to
furnish an excellent cutting edge. The entire length is 4,3; inches.

In addition to the above remarks concerning the second specimen, it
is of interest to call attention to the fact that upon the right-hand side of
the handle there occurs a rounded cavity, made with a rude implement,
which may have been intended for use in drilling—by steadying the
drill at the top. Such depressions and for such purposes are not rare.

Mr. L. M. Turner, Captain Herendeen, and others to whom reference —
is made elsewhere state that formerly the natives used fragments of ©
flint or quartz with which to engrave and decorate specimens of ivory,
bone, and other materials used for utensils and weapons. The small —
fragments of siliceous material were inserted in the end of wood or bone —
handies, though sometimes they were large enough to use without the

aid of a handle.
After a careful examination of all the engraved specimens of Alaskan
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 187

art work, in the collections of the National Museum at Washington, Dis-
trict of Columbia, and the Alaska Commercial Company in San Fran-
cisco, California, it appears that the more modern specimens of ivory
are engraved in a manner indicating the use of steel-pointed instru-
ments, such as are shown in plate 19. The lines or incisions are fre-
quently very pronounced and represent deep regular channels in which
the two sides converge to a sharp cut beneath or at the bottom, resem-
bling a V-shaped groove of elegant uniformity. In the older specimens
of ivory carving, such as are very much surface worn by frequent and
long continued handling, or have been in the possession of certain
individuals and families for a long time, the creases have become less
deep, and where they are sheltered by lateral ridges they still indicate
an origin of a more primitive kind, being made, perhaps, by less expe-
rienced artists or with ruder instruments. The numerous hair-line
scratches and frequent apparently accidental slips of the point would
indicate the use of a point less acute than the modern steel gravers
made by the natives at this day, and which are herewith illustrated.

In some of the later engravings the grooves are regular, deep, and
pronounced, the cut being sometimes vertical, so as to show the lateral
edges at right angles to the horizontal base of the groove, indicating a
strong hand pressure of a square cutting edge. The greater number of
lines are made, evidently, by using an angle of the graver, the result
being similar to that resulting from the use of a variety of the three-
sided or triangular graver used in wood engraving.

An examination of the ends of short lines, especially those employed
in simple ornamentation, illustrates at once that most of them are made
by cutting from the outside toward the main object or body of the
design. In this manner the very short lines resemble arrow-headed
ornaments or projections, or minute triangles. This is particularly
apparent in some of the specimens referred to in connection with
conventionalizing and to the art of the Polynesians.

Drills and simple borers appear to have been made by securing to
wooden handles rather thin but elongated pieces of chalcedony, or similar
siliceous minerals. Slight depressions or pits apparently made by such
tools are frequent, and it is probable that before the introduction of
metals nearly all perforations in bone, wood, and probably in ivory,
were thus made. In larger cavities in bone and ivory, such as would
serve for steadying the rear or upper end of a fire-drill during rotation
of the latter, the origin thus attributed is often very clear, the rounded
cavity, when not yet entirely smoothed off by use, retaining the marks
of workmanship made by a erude tool or instrument.

That circles were made by turning the specimen to be engraved and
holding firmly the stone-pointed graver and pushing it toward the
specimen has been affirmed by one correspondent; but such instances
were no doubt rare, and it is believed that no example of a circle,
nucleated or otherwise, made in this offhand manner will be found in
the extensive collection of the National Museum.
788

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Captain Herendeen states that sometimes a fragment of flint—though
generally one of iron or steel and consisting of a narrow strip of perhaps
the width of a large nail—was filed at the end so as to receive a
V-shaped notch, one point being a little longer than the other. It is
well known that pieces of hoop iron, nails, and other articles of iron

BARROW.

and steel are similarly employed by our native Indian
tribes, and it would indeed be a strange fact if the Kski-
mo did not seize upon and utilize such a valuable sub-
stance as metal when the opportunity was presented,
and after having seen sailors and others work them
into desired shape by hammering or filing.

The nuclei of many—I might almost say
nearly all—concentric circles are deeper
than the circles surrounding them. This
may be the result of having the longer
point of such a V-shaped notched tool
forced deeper into the material to be dec-
orated, giving the instrument a secure
point for rotation, so that the outer or
cutting end may not so readily slip from
its intended course.

In this manner, and for making concentrie
rings, one such tool would be necessary for
each size of circle required. Reference to
the various illustrations will elucidate this
more clearly.

Accurate measurements of the diameters
of circles upon any particular specimens
indicate the use of a number of such in-
struments with different sized bits, and
varying distances between the points.

Another class of circles, with nuclei,
appear to be made with auger bits, the

central pin being filed to a sharp point, while the
outer vertical cutting edge is also filed so as to cut
toward the surface of the ivory, and to remove the tex-
ture upon which the auger is impressed. The grooves
resulting from such work and with such an instrument

are sharply defined, with lateral sides and a nearly level ep Eee
bottom, while the circles are mathematically accurate ?

in form. An illustration of such work is reproduced in

plate 19, the specimen being from a locality north of Norton Sound.

The smaller and more delicate circles occur on earrings and other like
objects of personal adornment, and upon such articles of frequent need
as sewing utensils, examples of which are given in a number of illus-

trations.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 789

Upon the pipestems also are shown excellent results of such aborigi-
nal work, the ivory stem shown in plate 20, bearing eight sets of
circles, that one nearest the brass-bound mouthpiece consisting of but
a single circle with its central pit or nucleus one-eighth of an inch
deep, while the circle itself is but a mere hair line in comparison; the
next two figures consist of two circles each with the central spot, the
next four having three circles each beside the central point, while
the last, or eighth, has four concentric rings and the central nucleus.

According to measurement, the inner or pri-
mary circle, in all, is three-sixteenths of an
inch in diameter; the next larger one, begin- ;
ning with the second ring, is one-fourth of an 7 s
inch in diameter; the next larger, being the is
outer circle on the fourth figure, measures
three-eighths of an inch, while the outer cir- =
cle of the last figure, having four rings, meas- wey
ures one-half of_an inch in diameter. Miche a see te eet

The central pit or nucleus in each of the
circles, excepting two, is filled with a tightly fitting wooden peg,
smoothed off level with the surrounding surface, and carefully black.
ened to accord in color with the surrounding blackened circles.

This regularity in diameter of the several sizes of circles indicates
the use of a bit, or tool, of foreign manufacture which the natives
obtained probably through barter. The sizes increase by one-sixteenth
of an inch each time a change is made corresponding exactly to the
regulation sizes used by carpenters and other workers in wood.

Drills are used for perforating all kinds of materials, wood, bone,
ivory, and even metals, and are much more common than awls among
the more northern natives. The handles are of wood and sometimes
bone, the point being made
of iron or steel, though before
the introduction of metals
flint and similar siliceous ma-
terials were employed in arm-
ing the tool.

The illustration given in
fig. 5 is a bone pointed drill
from Point Barrow, while fig.
6 represents one with an iron drill mounted ina handle of spruce wood
which was once painted with red ocher. When the natives use the drill
and bow, both hands are necessarily occupied, one in steadying the
object to be perforated while with the other the bow is held and moved
horizontally to rotate the drill.

Therefore, to produce the necessary pressure upon the top of the
drill, the native puts into his mouth a drill mouthpiece in which the
top of drill rotates. Fig. 7 represents a mouthpiece with an iron

Fig. 8.

790 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

socket, while in fig. 8 is another also of wood, but holding a socket of
syenite to withstand the friction of the drill.

Some of the specimens in the collections of the National Museum are
decorated with the usual deep incisions found in Point Barrow bag
handles and tinted with what appears to be red ocher.

In several instances the wooden pegs inserted in the perforations
made to represent eyes, ears, or nostrils, of small animal forms, are
colored, and in other specimens, such as earrings, glass or porcelain
beads are inserted instead.

After the etchings have been made in the ivory or other material,
the creases or incisions are colored so as to bring out the design in
sharp contrast to the surrounding surface.

Mr. Turner informs me that ‘the black substance used to color the
etched lines was from the charcoal prepared from burned grass, then
powdered, mixed with oil, and rubbed into the etching. Afterwards the
begrimed hand of the owner was sufficient to renew the coloring mat-
ter. Some of the etchings are colored with a red substance which (an
innovation in the art) is procured from the traders’ stock.”

Mr. W. H. Dall remarks:

The coloration of wooden articles with native pigments is of ancient origin, but
all the more elaborate instances that have come to my knowledge bore marks of
comparatively recent origin. The pigments used were blue carbonates of iron and
copper; the green fungus, or peziza, found in decayed birch and alder wood; hema-
tite and red chalk; white infusorial or chalky earth; black charcoal, graphite, and
micaceous ore of irons.

A species of red was sometimes derived from pine bark or the cambium of ground
willow. In later prehistoric burial places, the wooden earrings bear the colors
nearly as bright as when first applied.

PORTRAYAL OF NATURAL AND OTHER OBJECTS.

In the following illustrations, which represent selected figures from
various records, will be noted the several styles of illustrating like
species of animals, and the fidelity of expression and outline of some
Specimens in further illustration of the intimate acquaintance by the
aboriginal artist of the subject by which he attempted to portray his
skill.

Plate 12 serves to illustrate the form of the Barren-ground caribou
or Alaskan reindeer, as well as the horns of the male and female, while
in the representation of the form of the walrus similar accuracy 18
attained, aS may be observed by comparing numerous etchings with
the illustration on Plate 11, which represents an exceedingly well-
formed walrus.

In fig. 9 is presented a herd of reindeer shown in various attitudes,
the general execution of the figures being very cleverly done. The
heads of some are turned to the front, thus showing decided success in
an attempt at foreshortening; some of the animals are lying down, as
if resting, while others appear to be browsing.

The animals composing the herd in fig. 10 are engraved so as to rep-
resent them in various attitudes. In No. 1 the animal appears to be
coming up, as out of a depression, or water, while in No. 2 the animal
is grazing. No. 3 is in the act of lying down, as shown in the bent
legs. In No. 4 the animal is lying down, and the head is drawn so as
to make it appear as if looking either toward or away from the beholder.

v7 HERD OF REINDEER.

Foreshortening is of rare occurrence in primitive art, but besides the
preceding instance the animal in No. 6 is also partly portrayed in such
an attitude. No. 5 is not definitely depicted, the horns being in
such relative position with the body as if the animal’s head were turned
around as if it were licking its side. No. 7 is a doe, while No. 8 is a
male, without any indication of action being shown.

HERD OF REINDEER.

Infig.11 the native artist has certainly expressed an intimate acquaint-
ance with the habits of deer. The attitude of the animal in No. 1
seems one of careless interest, if it may be so designated, in what the
rest of his comrades may show more concern. No. 2 is in the attitude
of rising from the ground, while that in No. 3 exhibits a desire to move
away aSif from anenemy. No. 4 is shown, by the position of the legs,

to exhibit more activity in hastening away. The foreshortening visible
in No. 5 seems to place the leader of the herd in the attitude of a pro-
tector, being on the defensive, and showing a disinclination to run
away from those over whom he may have exercised the privileges or
rights of a leader. In this instance, as in the following illustration,
very excellent workmanship and artistic taste are exhibited.

In the illustration shown in fig. 12 the deer have congregated

because of an alarm, their heads being directed forward toward the

beholder, the foreshortening being admirably executed. Four animals ©

are indicated, three being so closely placed as to make identification
rather difficult.

The various attitudes of reindeer portrayed in fig. 13 are readily
discernible, the heads and horns aiding in specifically distinguishing
the sexes, as also the various degrees of interest manifested at an
alarm, caused by the unseen approach of a hunter. The figure at the
right end of the illustration shows the native crawling up behind a
hillock covered with tall grass and weeds, his hand holding an arrow
and bow which he pushes forward before him. Several of the animals
are drawn foreshortened, an attempt in art seldom found among the
aborigines.

Plate 21, fig. 3, is a drill bow, and is from Kotzebue Sound. The
upper or convex side represents a herd of thirteen reindeer in various
attitudes of moving forward and grazing. The fourth animal from the
left end is drawn with its head very gracefully elevated and looking
backward, a fact very unusual in an aboriginal pictograph. The
curves are deep and heavy and quite characteristic of the engravings
of natives of the region from which the specimen was obtained.

Fig. 13.
HERD OF REINDEER.

This illustration is from the same bow of which the reverse is shown
in plate 22, fig. 2.

Plate 21, fig. 6, is also a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound, and is
very yellow with age. The figures portrayed denote reindeer. The
peculiarity of this record is the depth of the incisions forming the
characters, indicating bold, strong work. The under surface of the
bow also bears the outlines of reindeer (somewhat larger than those
upon the opposite side), which are drawn with great fidelity to specific
features, with the exception of the shape of the body. The peculiari-
ties of the horns are carefully noted by the artist, and the various
attitudes are exceedingly natural.

Plate 22, fig.2, represents a drill bow also from Kotzebue Sound,
measuring 14 inches in length along the convex surface. The record
portrays thirteen reindeer and three animals which may belong to the
same species, although because of their shorter necks and stouter
bodies identification is uncertain. The herd seems to be moving for-
ward, some of them engaged in browsing, and some attempt appears
to be made at perspective. The three short lines at the upper right-
hand side of the bow immediately above and in front of the right-hand
figures of the deer are the outlines of three otter. All of these

engravings are characteristic of the crude deeply incised lines of the
work accomplished by the Indians of Kotzebue Sound and vicinity.

Plate 23, fig. 2, is a bone seine shuttle from Cape Nome. This is
ornamented with several almost indefinite lines at the left, probably
representing seals, while the four conspicuous characters represent
well-engraved outlines of the reindeer. The shading or marking upon
the bodies of the animals is indicative of the markings of color upon
the animal, and upon the two middle figures this marking is indicated
by delicate vertical lines very artistically rendered.

Plate 24, fig. 4, represents a triangular drill bow obtained at Cape
Nome. The specimen measures 134 inches in length. The thirteen
figures at the left represent walruses, two of them heading toward a
kaiak occupied by a single hunter who appears to be chased by a
walrus coming from the opposite direction, as if it had been pursued
and probably angered by the five hunters shown in the umiak immedi-
ately to the right of it. The native in the stern end of this umiak has
successfully harpooned a walrus, as is indicated by the delicate zigzag
line connecting his hand with the harpoon which is securely embedded
in the breast of the animal. Now, turning the bow upside down, there
will be seen two walruses being towed along by an umiak occupied by
five hunters. Immediately to the left of this umiak
is another boat of similar construction which has just
been pulled on shore, as the position of the boat indi- ES
cates, as well as the attitude of the six natives walk-
ing along toward the left, each with something in his
hands, which has evidently been taken from the boat,
and which has been captured or secured on the hunt. The remaining
six figures indicate habitations. Again reversing the bow to the origi-
nal position, opposite to the beached umiak is a walrus which has been
captured by the hunters in the umiak proceeding toward the right and
toward another walrus which is there shown. The remaining six fig-
ures indicate habitations and storehouses, while between the former
are shown human figures in various attitudes as if occupied in different
tasks. The under sides of the bow bear hunting records, numbers of
which will be shown in other connections.

On plate 25, fig. 3, is shown a box for fungus ash. This appears to
be made of a piece of bone, is very crude, and bears about the middle
a row of five figures, the larger one representing a whale, the next a
reindeer, while the three smaller ones appear to be animals of the same
species.

Fig. 14 probably denotes one of the water birds, though why it fig-
ures on the ivory drill bow without any other characters, in context, it
is impossible to say. The attempt at engraving a record may have
been abandoned.

The two characters shown in fig. 15, are without doubt deer, as no
other species of the family is found in Alaska in which the tangs of
the horns project from the posterior ridge of the main branch. In the

the Ojibwa. No special information was received respecting the char-
acter, and it is probable that the head was obliterated by erosion,
having originally been drawn. The specimen was copied from an ivory
utensil in the collection of the Alaska Commercial Company in San
Francisco, California, and was obtained from the Aiqalu’/xamut Eskimo.

bow obtained at Port Clarence, Alaska, by Doctor T. H. Bean, formerly
of the United States National Museum.

The portrayal by the native artist of boats, both the kaiak and the

carvings that the photographic reproduction of native-made models
may be deemed of special interest. Plate 27 represents a kaiak, while

abundance, and will be referred to elsewhere and in another connection.
Fig. 28 represents four vessels rigged up with sails, the one at the

extreme left being manned by Americans or mixed bloods, distinguished

by the presence of hats upon their heads. The hulls of the second,

third, and right-hand figures are in imitation of
the native made vessel of that size, which is
adapted to the erection of masts and small sails.
The artist has evidently intended to represent
the different varieties used by him or his family.

Ay ere full sail, within reasonable distance from shore,
as is indicated by the presence of two pines which loom up in the mid-
dle distance. No special motive appears to have prompted the delinea-
tion of the ships, excepting perhaps the record of an unusual event
in the history of the locality where it is supposed to have occurred.
The portrayal of a schooner (fig. 30)
is perhaps only the result of “having
nothing better to do,” as loungers often
whittle or engrave figures or outlines
of such things that create passing in-
terest. It is probable too that some-
thing of greater interest may have been
connected with the arrival of a vessel from civilization. This, however,
could only be cleared up by the artist himself or the person for whom it
may have been drawn.

REPRESENTATION BY SYNECDOCHE.

The representation of part of an object to represent the whole, or vice
versa, is not so common in the etchings of the Eskimo as in the picto-
graphs of the Indians. |

In many instances in the ornamented ivory records, parts of animal
or other forms are portrayed in this manner, and such abbreviated
characters are subsequently utilized and arranged in such order so as —
to serve the purpose of simple ornamentation, the primary object or —
concept having but little if any further connection in its new position. ©

Mr. L. M. Turner! informs me that ‘the marginal engravures, —
resembling the tail of a whale, are intended to represent the number
of white whales { Delphinapterus catodon (Linneus) Gill.] the owner (or
maker) of the ivory article has personally killed or taken in a net.

There are, sometimes, partnership pursuits of these whales (as well as
other creatures), and by mutual agreement the quarry falls to him who
first struck, killed, or otherwise would have secured the whales.”

The spears which are portrayed upon some of the engravings of
natives in kaiaks are placed so as to be upon a rest, similar to that
shown in plate 29, in order that they may be quickly grasped for use. —
These rests are made of ivory, and in many instances are decorated. —

The entire length of the specimen is 84 inches, the distance across
the horns being 44 inches, and across the base, just beneath the figures:
of the whales’ tails, 24 inches.

The tails denote the owner to have been a whale hunter. The top of
the horns is fashioned in imitation of a whale’s head, the long-curved
mouth being carefully indicated, while blue beads are inserted to indi-
cate the eyes. Upon the outer edge of each horn, corresponding to
the back of the whale, is a cross, in the middle of which is a blue
bead. The four loops of thong are for attachment to the boat.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 199 -

In the illustration shown in figure 33, the idea of many and much is
expressed in the same line of thought or conception as in gesture lan-
guage. The herd of animals, instead of being indicated by drawing
the bodies of those in the foreground singly and complete, and only
parts of those beyond being perceivable to the beholder, is represented,
with one individual exception, by a single figure of a long body, the
thirteen heads being subsequently placed at proper intervals above it,
while a certain, though deficient, number of legs and feet are drawn
beneath and extending to the ground. These are all drawn as if escap-
ing from the hunter.

At the extreme end of the engraving is the representation of a
hunter, armed with bow, and indications of arrows. Parts of the figure
have become obliterated by frequent use of the ivory drill bow. The
deer next to the hunter does not face in an opposite direction, as if
escaping, but is drawn with the head lowered and directed toward him.
The attitude has perhaps no special signification, further than that
this deer was secured by being shot with an arrow, whereas the
remainder of the herd which the hunter saw escaped. Compare also
figure of herds in plate 65, fig. 4.

Plate 21, fig. 3, represents the convex side of a drill bow, on the right
half of which are thirty transverse figures representing that number
of wolf pelts. To the right is one otter skin and the outlines of ten
bearskins. As will be observed, these figures are deeply cut and rather
conventionalized. The great amount of coloring matter and deep inci-
sions represent the bold, strong work, characteristic of the natives of
Kotzebue Sound. The lateral edges are ornamented with parallel
longitudinal lines.

The regular order of the outline of pelts and hides is perhaps not only
illustrative of the great number of animals killed, but the regularity and
repetition of specific parts of the animal’s body, and the concavity of
the sides of the bears’ skins, is a tendency toward conventionalizing.
On the whole, the record is a good illustration of synecdoche.

As there will be occasion to refer to another curious subject in pictog-
raphy—the transmission of special characters, or the utilization of
native symbolic characters to serve as substitutes to replace imported
or intrusive forms—it may not be amiss to refer in this connection
to the interesting result noted in British coins, in which the native
Britons copied the obverse and reverse engravings which they found
upon the gold stater of Philip of Macedon. The coins were introduced
into the country of the littoral tribes through traffic with the Gauls,
while the latter obtained possession of them after Greece was plundered
by Brennus, B. C. 279.

The reverse of the typical stater bears a charioteer in a biga, the
two horses in the attitude of running, while behind is the outline of a
wheel, usually elliptical, as the space was not sufficiently large to permit
a circle as large as the extreme length of the ellipse to be recorded.
800 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The Britons in adopting the design for their native coins, and being —
perhaps—I may suggest the word certainly—unacquainted with the
form, or use, of the chariot, and the signification of other characters
and figures found upon the Greek prototype, reproduced in their suc-
cessive issues and recoinings variations in these foreign characters, or
replaced them by symbols with which they were acquainted and of
which they comprehended the signification.

In many of the British coins the horses are reduced to a single
animal, though with legs sufficient for two, clearly representing the
pair by synecdoche, exactly as our North American Indian does in his
records of personal or tribal engagements with the enemy.

Illustrations relating to this peculiarity on the coins named, together
with the substitution of native and familiar characters and symbols
for those of foreign and unknown types, will be presented farther on.!

DECORATION AND ORNAMENTATION.

The importation into Alaska and the adoption by the natives of art
designs which are foreign to their own does not appear at all impossible,
and the subject is one which would seem to offer an interesting field for
investigation with a reasonable hope of interesting developments.

With respect to the probability of the transmission of such art work,
Mr. Hadden,’ whom I have before quoted, remarks:

As decorated objects must be conveyed by man, the means for their dispersal and
the barriers which militate against it are the same as those which operate on human
migrations; but there is one difference. Where men go we may assume that they
carry their artistic efforts and proclivities with them, but decorated objects may be
carried farther than the actual distance covered by the manufacturer, or even than
the recognized middleman or trader.

This brings us to a very important subject, and that is the question of trade routes.
Trade routes are culture routes; and in order to appreciate the history of culture, it
is necessary to know the directions in which it flowed. Until we have a more com-
plete knowledge of the ancient trade routes of Europe, we can not recover the history
of the prehistoric Europe.

This subject is now beginning to receive great attention in the Old
World, and some highly interesting and valuable facts have been.
brought to light.

In North America the study of prehistoric trade routes, or culture
routes, has thus far received but a limited amount of careful attention;
but some instances of curious results of intertribal traffic have been
observed. Frequently designs of a specific character, such as may be
termed peculiar to a special tribe, are carried to remote localities and
there adopted by other tribes of an entirely different linguistic family,
whereas the same design or pattern of the former may not produce the
slightest apparent effect upon the recognized art designs or ornamenta-

‘Special attention is called to the work of Doctor John Evans, D.C. L. The Coins
of the Ancient Britons, London: 1864-1890. Plates A-N., and 1-xxu, together with
figures in text. Map.

tion of an adjoining body of people of a like linguistic family and with
whom there may be frequent social intercourse. This is‘accounted for
in the instances in mind because of the absence of like materials and
resources quite necessary for a faithful imitation of the imported pat-
tern, the original being fully recognized as a cult symbol, and any
alteration however slight would immediately provoke the anger of the
gods. Therefore, a remote body of people whose cult beliefs are differ-
ent, and who would perhaps not recognize the sacred or mystic import
of a symbol, might readily and without any hesitation adopt such pat-

_tern as might suit one’s fancy and subsequently alter it to conform to
the shape of the material upon which it would be imposed by incision,
impressed in color, or otherwise.

The northwest coast of America, between Puget Sound and Kadiak,
is an excellent illustration of a culture route, and the arts of the vari-
ous Selish tribes are traceable over a wide area. The peculiar designs of
the Haida, both in sculpture and in tattooing, have been gradually car-
ried northward into the territory of the Thlinkits, the Kadiak, and have
been even recently adopted, to a limited extent, by the Aigalu/yamut
and Kiate/xamut Eskimo of southern Alaska.

The original patterns of the Eskimo, such as the lines dots, and
herring-bone patterns, do not seem to prevail against the rounded and
curved figures and designs of the Haida art. The origin of the latter
is peculiar, and the alleged development, if not the introduction and
adoption, of the elaborate system of tattooing since about the year 1833,
certainly offers an interesting field for critical research.!

The Haida patterns, as has been intimated, are very different in both
design and concept as compared with the artistic work of the Eskimo.
Both are peculiar to the regions in which they flourish, and no resem-
blance whatever is apparent. The Haida designs originate chiefly in
totemic, mythologic, and cult forms, which have, in many instances,
become so highly conventionalized as to become difficult of identifica-
tion. The Eskimo art embraces chiefly an attempt at personal and
family records of hunting exploits, with occasional ceremonials por-
trayed in little more than simple pictorial form, but there is present an
exhibition of the progress of recording both gestures and signals, to
aid in the explanation of the record, as well as frequent attempts at
the record of subjective ideas, a system of pictography foreign to that
of the Haida, and more nearly approaching the petroglyphs of various
tribes belonging to the Shoshonian linguistic family, conspicuous among
which are some of the pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona; and the
sculpturings found in Owens Valley, California, the authors of which
are unknown but are believed to have been members of the same family,
both because of the typical resemblance of many of the patterns and
the geographic location of the sculptured bowlders.

802 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Another trade route of importance in this connection is that afforded
by the waters of the Yukon River. Eskimo patterns have been car-
ried up into the country of the Kenai Indians, a tribe usually designated
in the northwest as the Tenanah, and of the same linguistic relation-
ship as the Apache, the Navajo, and among many others the Hupa
Indians of California. These designs are made up of straight lines,
dots, and nucleated circles, and occur upon strips of bone with perfora-
tions at one end, and used, it is presumed, as necklace ornaments.
Similar ornaments are found also among the Thlinkit, of which illus-
trations are given on plate 9.

In the National Museum is an interesting relic made of horn, used
as acylindrical box for dentalium shell money, upon which are incised
and blackened lines so arranged between two parallel longitudinal
lines that the original white surface of the specimen is a serrated figure
and not the ordinary zigzag, plate 30. Although the resemblance of
this to some of the zigzag and meander patterns of the Eskimo is very
striking, no connection can be apparently traced between the two peo-
ples, even along the supposed course of migration of the Hupa toward
the coast at the time of the separations of the Apache or Athabascan
tribes, vivid traditions of which still obtain among the Apaches, and
linguistic evidence of which is complete.

A well-known trade or culture route—in fact, one of the earliest to
influence the crude arts of the Eskimo—was by way of the Diomede
Islands, when the natives came in contact with the Cossack outposts in
eastern Siberia.!

The traffic which naturally resulted brought among the American
natives various articles of Russian manuracture, among which, no
doubt, were ikons and other Christian and ecclesiastical objects and
prints, articles which are usually found to be highly decorated in both
design and color. Such objects would most naturally tend to influence
the simple art of a people who were naturally given to the ornamenta-
tion of various utensils and weapons, as also of articles of clothing.

Through this channel were obtained, so Mr. Murdoch informs me,
the Siberian pipes and seal nets, which, together with the native labret,
have extended eastward of Point Barrow to Cape Bathurst, beyond
which locality,it is believed, neither are found. This blank area between
Cape Bathurst and the delta of the Mackenzie forms a barrier, or line
of demarcation, beyond which the several bodies of Eskimo are artis-
tically distinct from one another. In other words, the three objects
named as common to the Alaskan Eskimo are totally absent east of the
locality indicated, as found by Mr. Murdoch during his residence at
the Point.

Mr. Haddon? remarks that although decorated objects pass along

trade routes “and are distributed far and wide, it does not always nec-
essarily follow that the ornamentation itself is naturalized. It is pos-
sible that in many cases a certain style of decoration is associated with
a particular kind of object, and it might not occur to people to transfer
that decorative style to other objects, or at all events the process would
doubtless be slow.”

An interesting example of bone dress ornaments, bearing simple
decorations and common to both the eastern Eskimo and the Nascopi,
as well as the now extinct Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland, was
brought to my attention by Professor O. T. Mason, Curator of Ethnology
in the National Museum.

The specimens are reproduced in colored and plain sketches, and
presented to the National Museum by Lady Blake, of the Government
House, St. Johns, Newfoundland.

The illustrations represent the primitive bone ornaments worn about
the bottom of dresses prior to the use of metal substitutes, such as are
now attainable from the whites. These ornaments are chiefly of a class
which represent an inverted narrow letter V—thus, A—each about 2
or 24 inches in length and decorated with various angular designs.
Some of them have marginal incised lines, within which and attached
thereto are the base of triangular or serrated markings similar to
some Eskimo patterns, shown in various illustrations.

Upon the ends of some other small horn ornaments are similar rude
zigzag patterns, as shown in other illustrations of Kskimo workman-
ship.

The information is obtainable as to the conceptions which gave rise
to the art patterns of the Beothuk. The simple zigzag may have
resulted from an incised imitation of some notched ornaments made by
Nascopi, ornaments such as the Beothuk were undoubtedly familiar
with, as both varieties are shown upon the same plates of illustrations
made by Lady Blake. By laying the Nascopi ornament upon the slab
of horn used by the Beothuk, the incised serrations forming the border
almost exactly fit to the zigzag or serrated ornamentation forming a
border near the edge of the piece used by the latter.

Several patterns occur in Eskimo decorations, however, which, while
not exactly resembling patterns from other parts of the world, appear
to have originated with them, and were suggested to them by original
products or mechanical contrivances, as the Siberian kantag or wooden
buckets, in nests of several sizes, and the peculiar fish trap or run
placed in narrow channels of water, and perhaps the guides to the pit-
fall. To the latter class of ornamentation may be placed the “seal-
tooth” pattern. These two different types of objects may have
suggested the motive for the figure of concentric circles and the rude
zigzag, respectively; or the introduction from without the territory of
the Eskimo of these designs—the former, for instance, through the influ-
ence of the Russians, and the other, perhaps, from the vicinity of
S04 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Torres Straits and adjacent territory—may have been seized upon as
suggesting the outlines or concepts perceived in the native products,
the possible difference in artistic results being dependent upon the ~
difference in material upon which the designs are portrayed and to the
expertness or lack of skill of the Eskimo copyist or artist.

Upon a careful examination of all available materials bearing pic-
torial records or only simple decorative designs, several interesting
facts appear.

First. That the Eskimo east of Point Barrow, including those even
of Labrador and Greenland, exhibit but little artistic expression, this
being confined chiefly to lines, dots, and other similar rudimentary
markings which are employed almost wholly for decorative purposes.
This does not refer to various kinds of carvings and outlined flat fig-
ures in bone or ivory, which are intended to be stitched to clothing, a
custom very much resembling a like practice which obtains in Finland.
Neither does this refer to the custom of stamping designs upon cloth
or buckskin, a practice apparently learned from the several Algonkian
tribes with which some of the Hudson Bay and Labrador tribes of
Eskimo come in contact.

Second. That the Point Barrow natives are apgeeenicie but moder-
ately advanced in the art of recording tribal or individual events, cus-
toms, etc., and that most of their ivory utensils are not decorated; but
that where attempts at beautifying are apparent, only those designs
are adopted which suggest or require the least amount of manual exer-
tion and artistic ability, so that straight incisions, creases, or grooves —
are most numerous, while nucleated circles, and rarely also a few con-
centric rings, are incised, the latter apparently by means of the common
earpenter’s auger bit, properly filed at the cutting edge so as to pro-
duce a scratch instead of an incision, the latter being too delicate and
tedious a process for success in removing the dense resisting particles
of ivory.

Third. That the engravings on ivory and bone from the northern
portion of the west coast of Alaska, embracing the region about Kotze-
bue Sound and northward, and including Diomede Islands and the
opposing coast, as well as the area occupied by the Asiatic Eskimo, are
more deeply and crudely cut, as indicated by the lines being broader
and bolder than in the products from any other area. |

Fourth. That the general results in graphie portrayals are more artis- —
tic among the natives of Bristol Bay and Norton Sound, and improve ~
in delicacy of engraving toward the southward even to and including —
the Aleutian Islands; that the portrayal of animal forms is accom- —
plished with such fidelity as to permit of specific identification; that
the attempt at reproducing graphically common gesture signs become

%
more frequent, and various instances of the successful portrayal of
subjective ideas also occur. ,

WooODEN TABLET. PAPUAN ORNAMENTATION.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 805

Cape Avinoff nearly to Cape Romanzoff, Mr. Dall' remarks that they
have been reported as remarkable for the beauty of their workman-
ship inivory. ‘A kantag or wooden dish,” he continues, ‘‘ which was
obtained at Ntinivak by Captain Smith, was neatly carved and inlaid
with lozenges of white stone resembling gypsum. They were labrets
of the same material. Their food was principally fish and seal, and
they appeared to be very destitute of iron and other articles intro-
duced by traders. Their ivory weapons were of great beauty, and
some specimens of hollow carving would tax the resources of the most
skillful civilized workman to equal.”

In addition to the above named facts there occur other peculiar pat-
terns, two of which are of interest; they are respectively the figures of
concentric circles, and a Papuan-like zigzag design, to which reference
has already been made. The former is frequently a nucleated circle,
frequently regularly incised series of circles one beyond the other, and
occasional instances in which delicate radiating lines are attached to
the outer ring.

The other pattern is like, and yet unlike, that found in Papuan
decorations, in which is a rude wavy or meander zigzag, or even more
sharply defined interdigital lines, or perhaps even triangular projec-
tions so as to form true serrations, resulting in what is sometimes
termed a tooth pattern.

This particular form of Papuan art is usually drawn between or
within parallel lines, and extends transversely across the specimen
decorated. The Eskimo resemblances, if they may be so termed, are
represented on plate 31, figs. 2, 4, and 5.

Plate 32, fig. 4, represents an Eskimo comb, the curves upon which
form an interesting example for comparison with the Papuan designs
upon a tablet of wood, referred to and illustrated by Mr. Stolpe, of
Stockholm.? Plate 33,

Similar parallel lines carrying between them the same style of a
rude zigzag, but in relief, because the alternate triangular spaces have
been removed by cutting, occur upon various other specimens repre-
sented in various plates and illustrations.

The short transverse bars in this type of pattern represent in
some instances, according to an Alaskan informant and pictographer,
Vladimir Naomoff, conventionalized fish traps, such as are placed in
narrow channels of water for catching the migrating salmon. A sym-
metrical trap of such construction is shown on the faces of a pipe in
plate 60. The transverse lines or bars are complete in this illustra-
tion, however, yet the decorative or evolved figure is easily traceable
to the original. A simpler form of the same pattern appears in the
decoration on fig. 4 in plate 31, where the alternate short lines project
inward toward the opposing space between the short lines.

806 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The native drawings of the so-called fish trap or seal tooth pattern
also resemble the approaches to the game trap or inclosure, both
these contrivances being represented by horizontal or oblique or per-
haps even only parallel lines, leading to a trap or inclosure, along
which lines are short etchings or bars to denote the posts or divisions
to sustain the brush of the game drive or the wickerwork partitions of
the fish trap. These short lateral lines simulate the drawings made to
denote the separations or spaces between teeth like those of the seal,
of which examples are given in fig. 00, and, as was suggested by a
native Eskimo, the open mouth of the hunting seal was like the open
fish trap and game drive, ready to take in such prey as came within
reach. The conception of the design may be found in the trap, as
suggested by Naomoff, or in the ‘“seal’s mouth,” as suggested by
Nomikséner, a Kaviagmut Eskimo from Port Clarence, whose por-
trait is Shown in plate 2.

These drawings in ivory are usually placed between horizontal or
parallel lines, interesting because they resemble the chief character-
istics of Celtic art, of which there is no relationship directly except
as showing the like workings of man’s mind under like conditions.
“The Japanese, for instance,” says a writer in Archzologia Cambrensis,!
‘“jonore the margin altogether and make their decoration entirely
independent of it, but in Celtic art the patterns are all designed to
suit the shape of the margin.” This is true of much of the Alaskan art.

The early contact by the Alaskans with art products from the South
Pacific is believed to be pretty generally recognized; and an instance
of the discovery among the natives of Bristol Bay of the cocoanut
suggested an admirable material for engraving which was only sur-
passed in beauty and texture by walrus ivory. Various curios have
also been carried north by sailors, the carvings upon which have sug-
gested, no doubt, possibilities in engraving of which the Eskimo had
previously had no conception. Ilustrated newspapers are seized with
avidity, and reproductions of various cuts attempted, in some known
instances the features of faces being fairly truthful likenesses.

Much of the art of the Eskimo has been influenced, too, by the intro-
duction of articles of Russian manufacture, of which more is remarked
elsewhere. Two fairly good examples of native workmanship of this
are given on plate 34, figs. 1 and 2, and representing wooden boxes
with native ornamentation and Russian symbols of the cross and other
motifs.

The suggestion for engraving concentric circles being accounted for
as to origin and signification by Mr. L. M. Turner, and described farther
on, may also have been introduced through the medium of sailors and
others from the Gulf of Papua, where, according to Mr. Haddon, they
are conventionalized eyes in the ornamental faces carved on wooden
belts.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 807

In Alaska, however, concentric circles and nucleated rings have been
utilized to explain concepts other than the similar patterns which occur
elsewhere in the world, referring to other widely distinct origins and
concepts. (Compare with variants on plate 17.)

The concentric rings, being so generally widespread, survive in the
Kongo region and in Tangier, where the design may owe its origin to
the introduction of Mohammedanism and the Byzantine style of orna-
mentation; upon Roman lamps in the ruined church of St. Louis, in
Carthage; and in numerous localities throughout northern Europe as
rock sculpturings, and in bronze and other jewelry and ornaments.
America has many petroglyphs in which this design is found, the
greatest number being upon the basalt rocks in the arid desert south
of Benton, Owens Valley, California.

By these references to the occurrence in widely separated localities
of like designs, I do not for a single moment desire to convey the
impression that the belief is entertained that this is the result of
migration through the ordinary trade, or culture channels, as Mr.
Haddon designates them, but rather of independent development,
being evolved from very diverse originals and concepts. It is certain,
nevertheless, that in some instances religious symbols are carried
among peoples to whom they are artistically or technically foreign, and
to whom the signification would be meaningless but for the explanation
accompanying them.

In Alaska several different versions are given to account for the
origin of the nucleated circles, plain concentric rings, and rings with
dentations. Reference to like forms in other regions is made elsewhere.

Mr. Haddon! remarks with reference to such figures that ‘‘there is a
great tendency for spirals to degenerate into concentric circles; exam-
ples could be given from New Guinea, America, Europe, and elsewhere.
In fact, one usually finds the two figures associated together, and the
sequence is one of decadence, never the evolution of spirals from cir-
cles. The intermediate stage has been aptly termed a ‘bastard spiral’
by Doctor Montelius—‘that is to say, concentric circles to which the
recurved junction lines give, to a casual glance, the appearance of true
Spirals.’”

Interesting instances in support of Mr. Haddon’s statement are found
in the development of decorative designs among various tribes of
Indians, in which the textile designs were ultimately imitated in a
free hand style, thus gradually converting the angular into curved
figures, aS in the meander patterns so common in the basketry and
pottery designs of the several pueblo tribes.

In northern Europe and elsewhere in the Old World coils of withes,
cords, and other textile strands were imitated in metal, as may be seen
in many of the prehistoric relics of Scandinavia and France.

Associated with these patterns are series of figures consisting of

808 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

concentrie rings, which no doubt owe their origin to the vegetal
prototype.

Thus far no spirals have been observed in the native art designs of
the Eskimo as illustrated in the National Museum, and one reason for
the absence of spirals may be attributed to the difficulty of engrav-
ing the ivory satisfactorily, or perhaps to the absence of particular life
forms which might under other circumstances suggest such motifs.
The general shape of the spaces upon drill bows, being long and
narrow, would otherwise naturally suggest either a meander or a
continuous series of squids aS a most appropriate and convenient
pattern. Instead of these, however, the ornamental “ filling-in”
consists of straight lines of various lengths and at various angles,
together with animal or bird forms in various stages of abbreviation
through conventionalization.

DECORATION CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF LINES, DOTS, AND ZIGZAGS.

The older forms of ornamentation, as already indicated, seem to
consist of straight lines, dots, and <-shaped incisions, while the appar-
ently later ones are the circles, made by metal instruments possibly of
native workmanship, and the rude zigzag or meander. The applica
tion of these several types of designs to the ornamentation of various
articles of use is represented in the next few pages. Some interesting
examples of figure carving, bearing engravings of various types, are
also reproduced.

While the rude zigzag pattern is frequently alluded to as the “fish
trap” pattern—the name being deemed appropriate because the type
originated in that contrivance, according to Naomoff—the designation
‘seal tooth” pattern might be equally appropriate, as the arrangement
of the teeth and spaces between them may have suggested the pattern
among tribes in other parts of the Eskimo territory.

Plate 35, fig. 8, shows a woman’s skin scraper, from Cape Darby.
The specimen appears to be made of fossil ivory and is carved in imi-
tation of a whale’s tail, and rounded so as to fit the palm of the hand.
The front end has a deep incision, in which was placed at one time a
flint scraper, in imitation of other examples in the collection of the
National Museum. The specimen bears beneath a depression, show-
ing it to have been used for holding the top of a drill. The ornamen-
tation on both sides and transversely at the rear portion consists of a
single line to which are attached irregular short radiating or transverse
lines in imitation of the rudest type of the “fish trap” pattern. This
ornamentation is in accordance with the typical ornamentation of the
Eskimo, such as comes from the shell heaps of the Aleutian Islands,
across to the east coast of Greenland, and antedating very likely the
historic period.

In plate 31, fig. 5, is shown an ivory bodkin, here reproduced as of
interest in presenting upon the one side five parallel lines of unequal”

length, between which are the short lateral lines and zigzag, showing
the method of engraving and the artistic evolution of the pattern.

Plate 36, figs. 1-4, represent kantag handles. The specimen shown
in fig. 1 is from Sledge Island, and is ornamented by two parallel longi-
tudinal lines between which are cross lines by threes at intervals of
about an inch. In fig. 2 the sets of cross lines are by twos, but on the
inner side, facing one another, are short lines, as in the ornamental
pattern before referred to as the fish trap or seal tooth, giving rise
ultimately to the zigzag. In fig. 3 is represented a handle, upon the
upper side of which the ornamentation consists of ten whales in relief,
while upon the under side is a very neatly engraved mammal of the
same species, though extending horizontally instead of transversely.

In fig. 4 the upper side represents two horizontal lines with the short
lines extending inward between their opposing fellows, a sort of inter-
digitation, the interior spaces representing a rude zigzag with the outer
angles being removed instead of being shaped to a point, as in the true
Zigzag.

In the next illustration of a bag handle, plate 31, fig. 4, are three
parallel lines extending from end toend. From the outer lines inward
are short lines at intervals of perhaps } of an inch, while extending to
either side from the central line are similar short lines extending out-
ward so as to project between the short lines from without—a sort of
interdigitation, resulting in a double row of the ‘fish trap” pattern or
rude zigzag presented in so many of the illustrations.

Fig. 2 of the same plate also bears a series of like ornamentation, the
concept perhaps also being found in the fish trap.

Plate 37, fig. 3, represents a bow, one end of which terminates in an
animal’s head, while about the neck, the middle, and the rear end are
parallel lines, from the inner side of which and approaching the oppo-
site side are small triangular points so arranged alternately from one
side to the other as to leave an intervening space in the form of zigzag.
This design is very common on work from several particular localities.
It is used as an ornament in filling out blank spaces, as in the illustra-
tion (fig. 6 on the same plate, 37), where it serves to decorate seals’
skins, seventeen of them being placed inarow. This may be compared
with like illustrations in connection with conventionalizing.

Plate 31, fig. 1, represents a bag handle, locality unknown, upon
which is shown a pattern consisting primarily of a central incision
extending from end to end, from which radiate toward either side sev-
eral series of diagonal lines, which appear to be similar in type to that
shown in plate 38, fig 1, and on plate 39, fig. 2.

On plate 34, fig. 1, is a small wooden box obtained at Cape Nome.
It has a sliding lid, while the two lower projections, resembling feet,
are in reality the outlines of bears’ heads. As will be noted, there are
several outlines of flintlock guns shown upon the lid, besides other
characters, while along the margin are short diagonal lines arranged

810 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

in the form of zigzags. A few Russian letters are incised upon the ‘
sides, indicating the natives’ knowledge of, or acquaintance with, char- —
acters of that language.

In plate 34, fig. 2, is represented a box of almost the same form and
from the same locality, the bottom being represented in the illustra-
tion, and upon it a variety of ornamentation very much in imitation of
the patterns before mentioned and found on many of the specimens.
Upon closer investigation, however, it will be observed that the mar-
ginal lines bear between them small arrowheads or <-shaped figures,
while in the remaining spaces the ornamentation consists of parallel
lines, the intervening spaces being ornamented by short diagonal lines.
The two lozenges in the middle bear upon the center a cross, evidently
suggested by Russian ecclesiastical pictures or literature.

Plate 37, fig. 1, is a plain white ivory bow drill from Point Hope.
The ornamentation is visible in the illustration and consists simply of
the wavy exterior produced by filing a series of indentations along the
edge of the triangular bow.

Plate 37, fig. 5, also from Point Barrow, shows two parallel lines
extending from almost one end to the other, between which are diag-
onal lines at short intervals. The bottum edge of the bow is indented
at intervals of a little over an inch, leaving projections upon which
small triangular figures extend from the bottom, presenting an orna-
mental effect. The coloring matter apparently consists of red ocher.

Plate 38, figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, represent bag handles from Norton Sound,
St. Michaels, the Yucon River, and Point Hope, respectively.

In plate 39, fig. 1, the ornamentation upon the upper side consists of a
median horizontal line or crease terminating at one end with three per-
forations, which number occurs also at the other end of the rod. At
right angles to this median line, at either end, are eight nucleated rings.
At the center of the specimen are a like number, in the middle of which
group is inserted a large blue glass bead. Upon the upper side, instead
of a median line, the surface is filled with a continuous row of nucleated
circles. Upon examination, however, it is observed that the circles
consist of two or three different sizes, showing that instruments of
that number of sizes were used. The rings indicate, furthermore, that
the tool was of hard metal, but no doubt fashioned by the artist, a
narrow piece of steel having a crotch filed into the end so as to leave
two sharp points.

Plate 39, fig. 3, represents a very neat bag handle or bow drill nearly
18 inches in length. The top is fluted longitudinally by means of three
deep creases, while in the outer sides are a series of cavities or seal-
lops, also ornamented along the margin by incisions. This specimen is
interesting because of the great number of nucleated circles scattered
along the under side. Each of these circles seems to have been made
with the same instrument, which was apparently a carpenter’s bit,
one-fourth of an inch in diameter.

Plate 39, fig. 4, represents a bag handle marked with a single median
line from which the specimen slopes toward either side of the outer
edge, and it is also fashioned along the outer margin like the preceding
one, though the curves or scallops are longer. Between each curve is
a small V-shaped niche, while at the middle this is replaced by a short
scallop or curve.

The specimen represented in plate 39, fig. 2, is decorated upon the
upper side by a median horizontal line, deeply engraved, to which are
attached, by pairs, short diagonal lines exactly resembling the herring-
bone pattern, each pair of these patterns being about one-half an inch
from the succeeding pair. Upon the lower or concave side is a similar

median line, to one side of which are placed the figures of thirty-seven
geese, or skuas, swimming toward the right. The figures are as nearly
alike as can be nade by the average native artist, and are equidistant
from one another.

The regularity of the arrangement of these bird figures suggests that
ornamentation was aimed at as well as a historic record.

NATIVES ARMED WITH GUNS,

Fig. 34 represents but two of the five panels or spaces decorated,
both of which bear figures referring to canoes in which the men at the
rear are armed with oars, while those at the bow have guns raised as if
about to shoot. The partitions consist of transverse ornamental lines,
an improvement over the pairs or sets of vertical plain incisions shown
on the paneled record in plate 36, fig. 2.

The serrated inner edges of the dividing lines, facing one another,
resemble the conventional figures used to denote fish weirs, and appear
in the present instance to have been used as ornaments. As before
stated, the same pattern has been suggested, apparently, by the arrange-
ment of the teeth of the seal, illustrations of which are of frequent
occurrence in the collections of the National Museum.

In fig. 35 is the rude outline of an ivory harp on head, on which the
teeth of the seal are deeply acised, while in fig. 36 the pattern
approaches more nearly the rude meander, between which and the true
zigzag as made by the Eskimo there are constant gradations and
blending of form.

The native in plate 40, bottom line, is following a herd of walrus. He
is paddling with an ordinary one-bladed paddle, in front of which is

two flippers. Four cross-like characters denote flying birds.

The regularity and sameness of the figures seem to denote an attempt
at ornamentation as well as a hunting record.

Plate 14, figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7, show specimens made of reindeer antler,
and are from Norton Sound. The ornamentation is rude, and in all
but one case consists of the representation of animals. In fig. 4 the -
design is of the “fish trap” pattern, with a median line and short
alternate radiating incisions, the spaces being occupied by crosses,
probably the simplest and rudest form of ornamentation excepting the
simple straight line. At one end
appears to be an indication of eyes
and nostrils, but there is not suf- |
ficient marking toindicate whether —
this was intended for otter or seal.

The accompanying illustration,
fig. 37, represents a tool the use of
which is not known. “It hasa point like a graver,” says Mr. Murdoch,
‘‘and is made of reindeer antler, ornamented with a pattern of incised
lines and bands, colored with red ocher, and was perhaps a marline
spike for working with sinew cord.”?

Plate 41, fig. 5, shows a small ivory wedge, used in splitting small
pieces of wood. The specimen bears upon one side a nucleated circle
with two lateral radiating lines, different from the conventional flower
symbol, though resembling to some extent the circles and lines shown
on plate 29, fig. 5. Along the upper edge are three parallel lines.
From the outer ones, extending inward, are shown very short diagonal
lines, being a rude imitation of some of the “fish trap” patterns.

A general view of the specimen, taking note of the short curve over
the circle to denote an eyebrow, would suggest
the head of a bird, the parallel lines along the INV
lower left side very much resembling the mouth.

series of parallel lines leaving three spaces, the mins ee
central one consisting alternately of black and white squares, while
the lateral spaces bear continuous rude meander or zigzag patterns.
The latter are more neatly indicated by deeper incisions than usually
found in ivory specimens.

Plate 41, fig. 3, represents a bone guard, such as is placed over the
bow of a kaiak to protect it against floating ice. ‘The chief ornamenta-
tion consists of three parallel lineS extending along either side, within
which is the rude meander pattern, while from the outer sides extends —

to have served as a handle, as a small perforation in the middle seems
to have been made for the purpose of inserting a cord. The upper
side or half of this ornament is decorated with zigzag cross lines, while
the lower has the herring-bone pattern, like the ornaments upon one
side of the running figure in the preceding illustration, plate 41, fig. 3.

Plate 41, fig. 6, represents a bodkin, and is elsewhere referred to with
respect to ornamentation.

DECORATION CONSISTING CHIEFLY OF CIRCLES.

The several objects represented on plate 42 are variously ornamented
in simple patterns. Fig. 1 is an ivory ear pendant, which is creased
spirally from end to end by one continuous line. Tig. 2 represents a toy
fish, upon which is incised the figure of a wolf, with another linear
character somewhat resembling a crude representation of the same
species. |

The hair ornament shown in fig. 3 on the same plate is decorated
along the upper half by two pairs of transverse parallel lines, between

which are cross lines to resemble the common portraiture of a sus-
pended seine net, as shown on plate 59, also in fig. 79 on page 565.

The spear guard shown in plate 42, fig. 4, bears a simple vertical line
from which diverge, downward and on either side, three lines, between
which are small punctures. This enlarged figure suggests a like origin
as the ornamented line in the middle of fig. 6, the latter having for its
conception, no doubt, the plant symbol mentioned and figured else-
where, particularly in connection with plate 77, and in fig. 70, page 3635.
Compare also with fig. 11, on plate 77, and other types of circles repre-
sented thereon, which occur upon various types of Eskimo utensils and
ornaments.

Plate 42, fig. 5, is a common hook made for use in suspending various
household articles.

In addition to the lateral diverging lines, the central one is absent,
but in its stead a continuation of perforations from which radiate three
incisions, made by means of a narrow saw or a sharp-edged file. These
incisions serve instead of the narrow or shallow creases noted on figs. 4
and 5. Punctured spots are also added to serve as additional orna-
ments.
814 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The lower figure on plate 42, fig. 7, is an arrow straightener, made of
ivory. The lower longitudinal line has similar, though more frequently
recurring, lateral lines than on fig. 6, while the side bears a continuous
row of nucleated circles, the central cup-like perforations being unusu-
ally large in comparison to the rings surrounding them, clearly indicat-
ing that a one-eighth-inch auger bit was used in their production, as
a smaller instrument made speciaily for incising rings (as the V-shaped
cuts in the end of a piece of metal) would naturally have the two points
equally pointed. (Compare plate 77.)

The reverse of the side bearing the median line bears a similar inci-
sion from end to end, but the lateral, oblique, radiating lines are each
between one-eighth and one-half inch in length, somewhat between the
two sizes noted on plate 8. This is evidently without significance other
than that of ornamentation. |

In a private communication of recent date Mr. L. M. Turner informs |
me, with reference to the circle, that ‘this ornament is much more com-
mon south of Bering Strait, where it is a conventionalized representa-
tion of a flower.” Mr. Murdoch! writes:

Some of the older implements in our collection, ornamented with this figure, may
haye been obtained by trade from the southern natives, but the Point Barrow people
certainly know how to make it, as there are a number of newly made articles in the
collection thus ornainented. Unfortunately, we saw none of these objects in the proc-
ess of manufacture, as they were made by the natives during odd moments of leisure,
and at the time I did not realize the importance of finding out the process. No tool
by which these figures could be made so accurately was ever offered for sale. |

Neither Mr. Turner nor Mr. Dall, both of whom, as is well known, spent long
periods among the natives of the Yukon region, ever observed the process of mak-
ing this-ornament. The latter, however, suggests that it is perhaps done with an
improvised centerbit, made by sticking two iron points close together in the end
of the handle. * * ~* Lines rarely represent any natural objects, but gen-
erally form rather elegant conventional patterns. most commonly double or single
borders, often joined by oblique cross lines or fringed with short, pointed parallel
lines. * * * While weapons are decorated only with conventional patterns, other
implements of bone or ivory, especially those pertaining to the chase, like the seal
drags, etc., are frequently carved into the shape of animals, as well as being orna-
mented with conventional patterns.

Mr. L. M. Turner says, furthermore:

The circles which have smaller ones within represent the so-called ‘‘kantag” (a
word of Siberian origin introduced by the Russians), or wooden yessels, manufac-
tured by Indians and bartered with the Innuit for oil and sealskin bootsoles, ete.
These “‘kantags” are sometimes traded in nests, i.e., various sizes, one within the
other. (See figs. 4, 7, and 10, on plate 77.)

Regarding the ‘circle figures,” Mr. Turner? remarks further:

Iknow from information given by one of the best workers of bone and ivory, also
pipe-bowls, in the Unaligmut (or Unalit) village, near St. Michaels, that the circle
means a flower when it has dentations on the outer periphery, and some that were
unfinished on an old much used handle for a kantag (wooden vessel) were also said
by him to mean flowers.

Those circles also represent the arms; just why I do not know. The spots over a
dog’s eyelid, usually brown in color in the dog, are also called Tuq, and a dog thus
marked is called Tuqoliq. The word refers to the dark colored portion of that
region and has nothing to do with the orifice, but when the cirele is made thus ©,
then it refers to the hole [spot] and the surrounding part.

I have elsewhere shown how the circle, or rather the spiral, may be
drawn to denote mobility, as in the shoulder joint of the figure of a
grasshopper to denote the Nahuatl symbol for Chapultepeec.! The
circle is also used on various figures of seals, and apparently denotes
the shoulder joint, as shown in harpoon head in the collection of the
Museum (No. 43750). Further illustration of the conventional use of
circles is given under the caption of Conventionalizing, with plate 75.

The employment of an iron or steel bit, evidence of which appears
to have been one about three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, is shown
upon a neatly-carved seal obtained in St. Michael’s, here represented as
the lower right-hand figure on plate 45, fig.4. The specimen was used
as a Seal drag, two perforations beneath the reach communicating with a
larger one at the lower part of the abdomen, through which the neces-
sary cord was passed. These bit marks are in the form of decorative
circles, the central holes being in each filled with a wooden peg, the
eyes, though smaller, also being plugged with hard wood.

Plate 37, fig. 4, represents a specimen of bag handle or drill bow
from Point Barrow, showing a number of nucleated rings, only one
nucleus being without the second outer ring, indicating that these
circles are made with different instruments.

Similar nucleated circles appear upon specimens from an entirely
remote locality. In fig. 1 of the remaining specimens upon plate 43 we
have a fetish made of hippopotamus tooth, secured by Mr. Dorsey
Mohun on the Lukuga River, in the Kongo State, Africa. The nuclei
are probably one-eighth of an inch in depth, while the circle surround
ing each one-fourth inch in diameter. The groove clearly indicates
the use of a metal tool in every respect resembling the circles and
respective central pits upon the ornamented drill bow shown in fig. 4
on plate 37.

The specimen referred to is an imitation of the human form, the head
slightly bowed forward, the arms close to the body, with the hands
reaching toward each other before the body. The body is represented
as cut off a little below the umbilicus, and is scooped out below as if
intended to be placed upon a rod.

Another specimen, fig. 2, represents a hair dressing pin, from the same
locality, 23 inches long, with a sharp point below, while the almost flat
top or head is ornamented with five similar nucleated circles, each
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter.

The remaining specimen, fig. 3, from the Lukuga River, Kongo State,
Africa, is a slightly coneave disk, bearing five series of concentric

native manufacture, out of a piece of foreign iron or steel, the end —

of which was filed A-shaped, as mentioned in connection with the
instruments of the Eskimo. |

These African specimens, two made of hippopotamus teeth and one
of ivory, are similar in texture to the materials employed by the
Eskimo, and the process adopted practically the same because of such
texture.

These illustrations are here introduced not with the object of tracing
the migration or transmission of a given pattern, but because of the
interest naturally excited by the independent discovery of a process of
workmanship found to have developed in such widely remote localities.

In northern Africa the same form of cirele, nucleated and as concen-
tric rings, is very much employed for decorative purposes: What the
original signification may have been it is now, perhaps, impossible to
determine, and it may be that in the two localities to be referred to
below the designs were brought from Europe, and probably originally
from the Ottoman Empire.

On plate 44 is shown a leather, brass mounted knife sheath, at the
upper end of which is a tolerably fair attempt at a figure consisting of
concentri¢ rings, while beneath it a series of rectangular figures within
oneanother. The designs are produced by pressure from the under side,
the patterns having been made before the piece of sheet metal was
placed about the sheath. This example is from Tangier, in Morocco.

From an antique subterranean chapel at Carthage was obtained, |
about fifteen years since, a collection of Christian lamps and other evi-
dences of the secret profession of the then new faith, among the orna-
mentation upon some of which relics are many symbols of Christianity
and of monograms of the name of Jesus Christ, but the most interest-
ing in the present connection is the recurrence of the very widespread
figure of concentric rings, as also of squares or rectangular figures
within one another, as will be observed upon the illustration of the
Roman lamp in plate 45.

This illustration is reproduced from an article by A. Delathe on
Carthage Vantique chapelle Souterraine de la Colline de Saint-Louis.!

Upon another lamp of the same general form, from the same locality,
is a cross pattée, the arms of which are severed with nucleated and
concentric rings, exactly like many of those upon Alaskan objects.

The larger rings and square figures upon the lamp shown in plate 45
resemble those upon the brass-ornamented Moorish knife sheath from
Tangier, Morocco (plate 44), where it was secured by Lieutenant A. P.
Niblack, U.S..N. The chief interest lies in the two designs near the

top—one a figure of rectangles within one another, and the other ¢
figure of rude rings surrounding one another.

It is strange that these two designs should be suggested upon the
Roman lamp from Carthage, the latter of an early Christian period,
and from the same quarter of Africa. It is probable that both designs
may have their origin in the peculiar Oriental patterns so freely
employed in Mohammedan countries, in some of which they even ante-
date the birth of Mohammed. The occurrence of like designs in Turk-
estan is also mentioned, and their apparent absence in Hindustan,
as illustrated by the collections in the National Museum, is rather
remarkable.

The delicate zigzag lines on the middle band of the sheath are appar-
ently made in the same manner as like patterns on Polynesian weapons

‘and ornaments, by pressing forward upon the tool, and at the same

time rocking it from side to side, the lateral incised points being made
as the lateral cutting edge is depressed, and again liberated when
turning the tool toward the opposite side to make a similar mark. The
work is performed rapidly, and may be crudely though similarly imi-
tated by means of a very narrow chisel and a piece of hard wood.

The recent discoveries in Egypt by Mr. Flinders-Petrie are of so
high an interest to archeology generally, that a brief reference thereto
may be of interest, especially so because some of the pottery is deco-
rated not only with figures of animals and birds, but a common decora-
tive motive which represents ‘‘a long boat with two cabins, an ensign
pole, and many oars; sometimes the figure of a man is added.” A red
ware, said to have been imported from the Mediterranean region, bears
decorations of “dents de loup,” flowers, and plants.

Of great interest is the discovery of vessels bearing numerous
figures of concentric circles, vases of ruder type than the lathe-made
ceramics of the Egyptians, and recognized to be the workmanship of a
foreign people.

These intruders, the evidences of whose general culture, beliefs, and funeral cus-
toms show them to have been strangers in the Nile Valley. Not asingle detail of
their culture did they hold in common with the Egyptians. Moreover, their num-
ber, which was found to have spread over a considerable portion of upper Egypt,
from Abydos to Gebelen, over one hundred miles, whilst their influence was obsery-
able from Tenneh to Hieraconpolis, i. e., over three hundred and fifty miles, and
absolute control of the region which they assumed and which is shown by the total

absence of any object recalling Egyptian civilization, show them not only to have
been invaders, but invaders who once had swept over the region and who, settling

down, had lived there for a considerable period, borrowing little or nothing of the
people whose land they occupied. !

In connection with the report made by Mrs. Cornelius Stevenson,
whose words I have quoted, Doctor D. G. Brinton remarks that these

1Préceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, Pa., XXXV
1896. p. 57, Plate IV.

NAT MUS 95. 52

818 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

intruders were probably Libyans—that is, Berbers—the ethnography
of which stock has been a special study with him. Doctor Brinton
remarks: ‘This identification, I believe, will finally be established. If
we examine the configuration of the Nile Valley and its surroundings,
no other theory is tenable, providing the Libyan stock extended that
far south of the Mediterranean at a date 3000 B.C. We know they
did, and much earlier, from their very early presence in east Africa.”
It appears to be conclusively shown by Doctor Brinton’s further argu-
ments that the ‘new race” was of the Libyan stock.

The origin of the concentric circles and other incised ornamentation
as decorative motives on this pottery would seem to have come from
the Mediterranean, perhaps north of it, where a near approach is found
in later Neolithic stations in Itaiy, Spain, and in the lower strata of
Hasserlik. Could there have been a prehistoric common center of
development of this very common ornament in northwestern Europe,
from which it was carried into Scandinavia, and the valleys of certain
portions of France, where its occurrence is so frequently remarked in
bronze and other articles of personal adornment?

It has been shown that trade routes existed in prehistoric times
between Italy and the Scandinavian Peninsula and Denmark, the seat-
tered graves en route producing amber for one side and ornaments of
south European manufacture on the other. Similar trade routes, which
were also culture routes, have also been suggested as having existed
between Scandinavia across northern Europe and Asia down into India.
Why could not like routes have been followed in prehistoric times along
the lines of the localities producing so much jewelry and fictile ware
chiefly ornamented with spirals and concentric rings?

That trade routes existed between the countries of the Mediterra-
nean, even as far east as Macedonia, has been well established, and
the following remarks are of interest in this connection:

In the June number of ** The Strand Magazine”! appeared an illus-
trated article devoted to finds of coins in Great Britain, one illustration
in particular attracting my attention because of the presence upon the
reverse of a nucleated ring, which character in this connection appears
to have no apparent relation with the other objects represented upon
the coin and with which it is associated.

Upon reference to the various works on the coinage of the ancient
Britons, several curious, interesting, and apparently new facts present
themselves—facts which may with propriety be here referred to. The
subject seems to me to be closely related to that under consideration in
so far as it relates to trade or culture routes, and the adoption of char-
acters by a people with whose signification or import they may be unac-
quainted, and the ultimate replacement of such characters which may
be of importance in and a necessary part of the prototype, by the sub-

stitution of their own characters or symbols, through which change the
signification of the legend upon the prototype is lost, and would no
longer be recognized by the authors thereof.

I have already referred to the coinage of the Britons, as treated in
the admirable work of Doctor John Evans,! to which the reader is
referred for full details and ample illustrations in support of the sug-
gestions ventured below.

I have had occasion to refer to British coins bearing the figure of the
horse, with additional legs to denote that more than one such animal
was intended. Such practice of representing a part for the whole, or
vice versa, was referred to as synecdoche, and as being common to the
pictographic records of the North American Indians.

On plate 43, fig. 5, is the representation of an uninscribed British
gold coin, upon the reverse ot which appears the outline of a horse,
each leg divided into two, so as to resemble—in fact, give—eight legs,
and suggesting the two horses noticeable upon the obverse of the typical
prototype, as shown in fig. 1 on the same plate. Now, looking at the
legs of the horse on the reverse of fig. 2, there will be seen the same
number of legs, with the exception that the engraver of this piece has
united each pair at the fetlocks, so as to terminate in one hoof, instead
of two hoofs, as in some other examples.

In the specimens of the same series of coins the successive copying
of designs has resulted in solid legs instead of by pairs, thus returning
to a pattern on which but a single animal is portrayed.

But to return from this digression. It is necessary to show how the
original patterns came to be employed by the designers for the British
coins. It has been pretty clearly proven by Doctor John Evans, Mr.
Hawkins, and others, that the ancient Britons were possessed of money
long before the time of Cresar’s visit. The distinct mention of money

Doctor Evans remarks that ‘‘the coins themselves are most inaccurately drawn,”
yet they are interesting as showing a certain degree of evolution and alteration of
characters which the engravers copied or attempted to copy from the prototypes.

occurs in various classic writings of the time of Cesar, and yearly trib-
ute is noted by Dion Cassius, Eutropius, Diodorus, Strabo, and others.
Doctor Evans remarks:
It may indeed be urged that these writers are all of them later than Cesar; but
it is to be observed that the information upon which some of them wrote was derived
from earlier sources, and that not one of them treats the presence of gold and silver

in this country as of recent date, or appears to have had the remotest conception
that in the time of Julius C:esar it was destitute of them.}

Commerce between the Gauls and Britons existed long anterior to
the period of the Roman invasion, and a native coinage existed also
among the Gauls. Theintercourse of the Pheenicians and Britons was
also of an early date, and the founding of the Greek colony of Massilia
(Marseilles)—usually placed at about B. C. 600—also aided in civilizing
that part of Gaul, where the neighboring Gauls no doubt first learned
of the usages of civilized life, the effect of such acquirements gradually
extending toward the channel settlements, and finally across and
among the British tribes. From this center of civilization, says Doctor
Evans, the Gauls became acquainted with the art of coining.

The early silver coins of Massilia (and none in gold are known) were occasionally
imitated in the surrounding country; but when, about the year B. C. 365, the gold
mines of Crenides (or Philippi) were acquired by Philip II of Macedon, and worked
so as to produce about £250,000 worth of gold per annum, the general currency of
gold coins, which had before been of very limited extent, became much more exten-
sive, and the stater of Philip—the regale numisme of Horace—became everywhere
diffused, and seems at once to have been seized on by the barbarians who came in
contact with Greek civilization as an object of. imitation. In Gaul this was
especially the case, and the whole of the gold coinage of that country may be said
to consist of imitation, more or less rude and degenerate, of the Macedonian
Philippus.?

Doctor Evans further remarks :

Another reason for the adoption of the Philippus as the model for imitation in the
Gaulish coinage has been found in the probability that when Brennus plundered
Greece, B. C. 279, he carried away a great treasure of these coins, which thus became
the gold currency of Gaul. This would, however, have had more effect in Pannonia,
from whence the army of Brennus came, than in the more western Gaul.

On plate 46, fig. 1, is reproduced a type of the Philippus, the lau-
reate head upon the obverse representing Apollo (or, according to
some, of young Hercules), while on the reverse is shown a charioteer
in a biga, with the name of Philip below a horizontal line in the
exergue.

The biga on these coins of Philippus II refers to the victories of
Philip at Olympia. The resemblance to Apollo may have been sug-
gested by some relation to that identification of Hercules and the sun
which prevailed in Asia at a later time, and possibly as early as that of

live small dots are introduced in the face, so as to cover the space between
the eyes and hair. Beneath the horse, the helmet, visible in the stater, has
become a circle surrounded by smal] dots. .

The departure from the prototype is still more interesting in this specimen—
a nucleated circle, a plain circle, and a pellet appearing beneath the horse
in place of the helmet. Doctor Evans, from whom these references were
obtained, remarks that this specimen shows “a enrious instance of extreme
degradation from the type of the Phillipus on the reverse.”

The headdress resembles a cruciform ornament, with two open crescents
placed back to back in the center. The reverse bears the horse, with both
a circle and a wheel-shaped ornament in lieu of the helmet.

BRITISH IMITATIONS OF MACEDONIAN STATER.

Philip II.'!. Between the horses and base line is the figure of a helmet,
suggesting the head gear of the slain over which the victor is driving.
On some specimens the helmet is replaced by the fulmen, a A, or the
Greek /’.

Because of the limited space, the wheel of the chariot is rather oval,
suggesting perspective on the engraving, though on later imitations
this can not be claimed for the elliptical form of the wheel or the
‘character substituted therefor. ‘The earliest of the Gaulish imita-
tions,” says Doctor Evans,’ “follow the prototype pretty closely, but
eventually both the head and the biga become completely transformed.”

The earliest British coins showing such imitation of the Philippus
are believed to be of the period of 150-200 B. C., although the death
of Philip Il took place b. C. 336, so that his coins began to be
imitated in Gaul about B. C. 300.

The author whom I have above quoted says also that coins reduce in
weight for the sake of the small gain of the governing power; and
coincident with such reduction in weight, and perhaps size, there is a
remarkable change in types, in each successive imitation, thus depart-
ing more and more from the original prototype. ‘The reduction of a
complicated and artistic design into a symmetrical figure of easy execu-
tion was the object of each successive engraver of the dies for these
coins, though probably they were themselves unaware of any undue
saving of trouble on their part or of the results which ensued from it.”

By reference to the illustrations as figs. 4 and 5, and plate 47, figs. 3
and 8, examples selected from many diverse forms, there will be observed
a most remarkable deviation in engraving from the original type. The
wreath and hair become so strangely altered as to be scarcely recog-
nizable, a few geometric or other simple figures serving in place of the
leaves and locks. These finally result in a cross-like figure, as in plate
47, figs. 1 and 2, while in some still other imitations the head is repre-
sented by an ear of grain, like wheat or rye (designated by Doctor
Evans as corn).

The most interesting changes occur, however, upon the reverse of
the imitations, and it is to these changes that I wish to make special
reference. —

As stated, the typical Philippus bears beneath the horses a helmet,
as shown upon the illustration in plate 46, fig. 1. This article of head
gear may or may not have been known to the Gauls, and if it were, it
is more than probable that the Britons were unfamiliar with it, being
more remote from the peoples by whom such defensive armor was
used, so that even if the helmet was represented upon Gaulish imita-
tions, the British engraver seems to have ignored the exact form and

to have made what he thought may have been intended, or perhaps
even ventured to introduce a British symbolic figure, the signification
of which he did comprebend.

It is probable, also, that, in the absence of good tools for engraving
metals, some of the simpler designs were made by using a pointed
punch or like tool, and punching the patterns or parts of patterns —
desired. The pellet, surrounded by a ring of pellets, was equivalent —
to a ring with its nucleus, as in plate 46, fig. 8. The figure also pre- |
sents itself as a circle with four small pellets arranged in the form of a
cross, and plate 46, figs. 2 and 6, and finally in the semblance of a wheel
with six, seven, or eight spokes, illustrations of which are given in
plate 46, figs. 7 and 8, and plate 47, figs. 1, 2, and 8. Leaving off the
circle suggested a cross, as in the former, and a star, as in plate 47, fig.
3, both without doubt Druidical symbols, as was also the nucleated
ring, of all of which numerous examples occur. This cross or star form
ultimately gave rise to imitations of crab-like objects, which in turn
were interpreted to denote figures resembling the hand. Such gradual
though persistent imitation resulted in some remarkably dissimilar
patterns, as may be noted by comparing the typical Philippus in plate
46, fig. 1, with the illustration, plate 46, figs. 5 and 6, while beneath the
figure of a disjointed horse on plate 47, fig. 3, the star survives; while
the head upon the obverse retains but a few rectangular marks to denote
leaves, while the right-hand upper figure signifies the eye, and the lower
broken circle, bearing a <-shaped attachment, the mouth.

The A, which has been referred to as a variant, and rarely occurring
beneath the body of the horse, has been reproduced as a triangle, the
angles of which consist of nucleated cireles connected by short lines.
This symbol is also an astronomical character, and is of frequent occur-
rence on various petroglyphs located in that area of country formerly
oceupied by the several tribes of Indians composing the Shoshonian
linguistic family.

Again, the saine object figures extensively in the mnemonic records
of the Ojibwa Indians, especially those records relating to the sha-
manistic ritual of the Midé/wiwin, or Grand Medicine Society, elsewhere
described in detail.!. Another symbol found in lieu of the triangle,
though without doubt a variant of it, resembles an Ojibwa symbol to
denote ‘‘ the mystic power of looking into the earth and there discov-
ering sacred objects.” It consists of three rings, or perhaps even
nucleated rings, placed in the form of a triangle, a wavy line extending
around the upper circle and downward to either side toward the lower
ones, denoting “lines of vision.” What the signification of the char-
acter upon the coins may have been it is impossible to imagine, unless
it were merely a variant of the A, which in turn may have been a con-
ventionalized form of the helmet, as shown in the typical Philippus on

BEXIPIEAINATION OF PLATE 47.

Fig. 1. The head ornament on this piece becomes more cross-like than in the preced-
ing, while upon the reverse the appearance of a nucleated circle beneath
the horse is counterbalanced by another with an additional circle of dots
or pellets about it above the animal’s back. Upon the reverse is the name
of a prince, TASCIOVAN, whose Latinized name would be TASCcrlovaNnus, the
exact form in which the name appears upon the coins of Cunobeline, who
proclaims himself to have been TASCIOVANI F.

Fig. 2. On this piece the cruciform ornament becoies still more intricate, while the
circles are in various forms and of various types.

Fig.3. The remains of the wreath are undefined, and the object beneath the horse
has assumed a stellar form instead of a cirele, which in turn was a helmet
in the prototype.

Figs. 4-7. These coins are cast aud not stamped. In some specimens noted by Doctor

{vans the grain of the wooden mold is distinctly visible. The obverse
in all bears a head in imitation of some petroglyphic remains in North
America, though the reverse shows the outline of an animal believed to
be a horse.

Fig.8. This specimen has a laureate bust without any signs of a face; the open
erescents are connected by a serpent line. The reverse bears a horse with
a triple tail and a wheel beneath the body.

plate 46, fig. 1. Very interesting indeed are the coins of tin—or an
alloy in which that metal is in excess—though these are believed to be
Gaulish rather than British, although the head of the Philippus proto.
type is rudely reproduced, while the animal upon the reverse is believed
by Doctor Evans to represent a bull rather than the horse. Plate 47,
figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7.

The human head upon the obverse is the rude representation of that
part of the body, the face being indicated by two crescents, one above
the other, with the concave side outward. The eye consists either of
a simple ring, a nucleated ring, or the latter attached to a stem which
extends down toward the neck. The animal form upon the reverse is
readily determined by comparison with other coins showing variants.

The two characters beneath the animal form on plate 47, fig. 4, appear
to be a remnant of or to have been suggested by the exergual legend
on the prototype on which the name, in Greek characters, of Philippus
occurs.

On some of the British coins no trace of a legend remains, but in a
few instances some apparently meaningless characters appear to have
been introduced, clearly indicating that the engraver was aware of
some legend upon his copy, but being unacquainted with its import or
signification, introduced an equivalent in so far as ornamentation was
concerned, following the custom of geometric decoration. Such an illus-
tration is here reproduced on plate 46, figs. 3, 4, and 7. In other
examples again, this style of zigzag decoration is omitted below the
exergue line and a nucleated circle portrayed instead of a legend or
other character, as in plate 47, fig. 1.

The wheel of the chariot, which is apparent in the prototype, is gen-
erally oval, sometimes elliptical, and in some of the British imitations
a second wheel is placed upon any remaining otherwise vacant spot,
such an illustration being reproduced on plate 47, fig. 3, while in plate
46, fig. 8, two wheel-like characters are introduced, one above the body
of the horse and the other beneath, instead of the common nucleated
ring. In examining the numerous examples of coins one finds too that
the British engraver has introduced, instead of the figure of a char-
ioteer, a number of disjointed pellets or rings, and short straight or
curved lines, making it almost impossible to trace the original in this
jumble of characters. In some instances these segregated dots and
lines again appear to become readjusted, ultimately forming a chari-
oteer in the form of what seems to be a winged figure of victory.

Similar unique and interesting imitations occur on the obverse of
the British coins, in which the engraver’s interpretation of the head
_ of Apollo (or Hercules) is shown, sometimes as a fanciful cross, plate
47, fig. 1, and in other instances as an ear of grain, examples being
Shown in plate 46, figs. 3, 5, and 7.

In this use of the circles, nucleated rings, and other British or Gaul-
ish symbols upon British coins, no evidence appears of the transmission
824 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

of such characters from Macedonia, from which the coins were obtained
and which furnished the designs upon the Philippus for the British andl a
Gaulish engravers. Nevertheless, other of the Macedonian coins bear :
upon the reverse concentric rings, between which are serrations, so as _
to almost appear like circular saws of various sizes laid one upon the
other, diminishing in size toward the upper or last one. On a coin of
Herod I., bearing a Macedonian shield, while upon the obverse of the
same piece is a helmet, with cheek pieces, surrounded by a legend.
The helmet, which appears to form the chief emblem upon the piece,
greatly resembles the smaller headpiece upon the obverse of the stater
shown in plate 46, fig. 1

Mr. Gardner,! in his paper on ‘‘Ares as a sun god, and solar symbols —
on coins of Thrace and Macedon,” shows that the Macedonian shield
is of astronomical pattern, and belongs specially to a deity who is
worshiped as the sun, and the interior device of this shield on the
coins of Herod I. is identical with that adopted as the whole type on
certain coins of Uranopolis of Macedon.

The occurrence of circles to denote ring money is found in the Kgyp-
tian hieroglyphs, and it is barely possible that such characters upon
obelisks, or in other petroglyphs, may have had some reference to ring
money in the various countries with which the Egyptians were in com-
mercial relations, extending possibly to Macedonia, Phoenicia, and other
of the peoples of the northern shores of the Mediterranean.

The Egyptians used rings of gold and silver, and the Hebrew expres-
sion for the heaviest unit in weight, the talent, originally meant a circle.
Gold rings, says Mr. Madden,’ were also used as a means of exchange
in Britain, in the interior of Africa, among the Norwegian sea kings,
and in China disks with central perforations are employed. The brass
cash is an illustration of the latter, and the sacred writings make
frequent reference to rings of metal and strings of gold, the latter
evidently being tied in bundles of certain specified weights and values.

Interesting as this subject may be, it would be inappropriate in the
present paper to continue the study of types of rings and variants
and their signification in the various localities throughout the world
in which they occur as originals, and as the result of intrusion by
intertribal traffic or otherwise.

The wooden tablet represented in plate 33 is reproduced from
Doctor Stolpe’s monograph, published in ‘“‘ Ymer,”* and illustrates one
characteristic type of wood carving found in Polynesia, or, to be more
exact as to location, in the Tubuai Islands. The circles are rather
infrequent, but the triangular decoration is more common, and occurs
upon various ceremonial implements and weapons in various forms and
amb nanons: In some czamules the designs are very complicated

and elaborate, while in other instances, as upon a metal surface, the
result is a mere zigzag, the result of using a narrow graver, and as it
is pushed forward the tool is rotated from side to side.

The character of the material upon which decoration is attempted
greatly influences the artistic result.

Some circles from eastern Turkistan, to which my attention was
ealled by my friend Doctor Walter Hough, of the National Museum,
resemble almost exactly those mentioned by Doctor A. B. Meyer,
who presented some interesting illustrations of shields from the Bis-
marek Archipelago and New Guinea, upon some of which are several
series of concentric rings (four) while some are nucleated with a solid
spot and three surrounding rings.!

In his monograph on the whirring toy or ‘‘ bull-rorer,” Doctor J. D.
HE. Schmeltz? presents a number of illustrations from various localities,
nearly all of which are ornamented. Two specimens from West Aus-
tralia are of peculiar interest, from the fact of the recurrence of two
figures shown on a Roman lamp from Carthage (plate 45, p. 816). The

one specimen of these wooden toys is ornamented with five figures of
concentric circles, the three middle ones having each five rings, while
the flanking or end figures have each but four rings.

The other toy has upon one side three figures of rectangles, each
figure consisting of a nest of five, one within the other, as in the con-
struction of concentric rings. At either end are short curved lines.
Such a coincidence—as it can be nothing more—is truly remarkable,
especially as the Australian designs are not in exact accordance with
the usual type of designs.

The district of Thisted, Denmark, contains many small grave mounds,
from some of which unique finds have been obtained. One clay vessel
covered with a flat stone contained about one hundred small boats, the
ribs and sailing of which are made of bronze bands bent around one
another, while in the middle of these lie sheets of thin plates of gold
whose corners overlap each other at the bottom of the boat and are
bent around the bronze bands above, covering it. In the same manner

the outside covering is effected.1_ Upon the side of the boat illustrated
in fig. 388 will be observed two figures of concentric rings, a design so —
frequently met with in the prehistoric relics of Scandinavia. 4

A wooden dish,? found with other objects in a funeral ship, bears dee-
orations consisting of concentric rings similar to the preceding.

Petroglyphs in abundance representing so-called cup stones, nucle- —
ated circles, and concentric circles of various numbers of rings, as high —
as five and six, and occasionally even more, occur throughout northern —
Europe, from. Ireland, Scotland, and elsewhere in the British Isles, —
eastward throughout Scandinavia, Finland, and Russia, into Siberia.

In a petroglyph at Lokeberg, in Bohuslan, Sweden,* are represented
anumber of manned Viking ships, above three of which are portrayed
nucleated rings, several of which are attached to projections connected —
with the vessel, and resembling uplifted banners or other emblems. In
a number of instances are small spots only, without the surrounding
circle, These circles in contact with vessels resemble very much the

of the vessel is another row of raised concentric
rings, the outer one measuring about five-eighths of an inch across,
while the circles near the base, and extending in a row about it, are
apparently a little less in diameter.

These rows of circles are separated by longitudinal raised lines,
between some of which, both above and below the row of the largest cir-
cles, are short vertical lines presenting what appears like a milled edge.

This style of ornament is very general and, as noted elsewhere, of
widespread occurrence.

strips of cloth, to which are attached “brass disks (about 3 inches in

diameter) and other ornaments, such as brass charms, beads, and but-
tons.” It is probable that these materials are specially made in Russia
for trade with the natives; nevertheless the nucleated circle is an
important feature in ornamentation thereon, the metal pendant, of
which an illustration is given in fig. 59, being not only very similar to
the prehistoric ornaments of Scandinavia, but is decorated in the same
manner.

Mr. Jackson says furthermore: ‘ While I am talking about Samoyad
jewelry, I might mention the vast buckles sometimes used to fasten the
belt. They are made of brass, stamped out with patterns, and are
often 9 inches in diameter. Of brass, too, and copper are their rings;
and they even wear reindeer bells, each weighing at least half a pound,
hanging from their elbows.”

It is but natural to suppose that native art is thus stimulated, and
influenced, by the probable introduction of materials of foreign manu-
facture, such trinkets being gaudily decorated to add to their attract-
iveness in the estimation of the uncultured natives.

DECORATION OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS, UTENSILS, ETC.

The utilization of various figures to apply simply for ornamentation
is very common, and is of later date than the incision of simple lines
and dots. The animate and other characters do not seem to have been
used in any esthetic manner until the system of pictography had gained
a firm foothold. Numerous examples are here given of simple decora-
tion of drill bows, for which no other record was ready, and of the
various styles of decorating articles of primitive jewelry or personal
ornaments, and other objects of daily use.

The following list comprises a number of selections to illustrate the
various methods of decorating articles of personal use or adornment,
utensils of daily use, and other objects.

A number of ear pendants are represented in plate 48, figs. 1-8 and
10. The chief interest lies in the variety of ornamentation, consisting
of drill holes, circles, concentric rings, and in one instance serrations
are attached to the circles.

The cup-shaped specimen shown in fig. 9 is a powder charge, orna-
mented with conventionalized figures of flowers, fruit, etc., to which
special attention is given in connection with conventionalization.

Plate 32, fig. 1, represents ear pendants made of beluga teeth. They
were obtained at St. Michaels, and are ornamented with the zigzag
pattern frequently alluded to as the “fish trap” pattern. This pattern
is quite neatly made and presents an unusually pleasing effect. Upon
the bare space between the two transverse rows of ornamentation is
incised a small cross—a figure quite unusual in Eskimo art.

Plate 32, fig. 2, represents a buckle or ornament used by girls in
securing the hair. The decoration represents a face, the eyes being

indicated by sharply incised lines, while the pupils are perforation
made with a drill. The nostrils are also indicated with delicate per-
forations, and the teeth are well defined. The lips are also well defined |
by means of transverse lines representing the gums and the edges of the ,
teeth, while the other lines drawn vertically denote the spaces between _
the teeth. :

Plate 32, fig. 4, represents a comb from Cape Prince of Wales. This.
is of peculiar interest from the fact that it exactly represents in outline
specimens from Torres Strait. The ornamentation resembles Papuan
art designs, and also the peculiar meander or zigzag pattern referred —
to in plate 35.

On the inner space are three ornaments which represent the conven-
tional tree symbols. The specimen is an old one, as may be observed
from its past usage and discoloration. The teeth are broken and appear
to have been short. They were no doubt made by sawing with instru-
ments such as are shown in plate 17.

Plate 49, fig. 4, represents a pair of earrings secured ina stick. Upon
the front are ornamental incisions representing concentric rings, from
four sides of which extend short lines terminating in perforations. In
one of these, however, the short connecting lines were not inserted—
this part of the operation having evidently been neglected.

Upon the reverse are short projections which are carved so as to
curve downward, forming an [T-shaped hook for insertion in the lobe of
the ear.

Plate 49, fig. 5, shows a similar stick with wrapping so as to secure
a number of earrings which have been inserted, and in which manner
they are transferred from place to place for sale or for barter.

Plate 50 represents a series of carved ivory belt buttons and pend-
ants, as well as two spear guards for attachment to a canoe. On fig. 1
is Shown the crude meander or zigzag so frequently referred to. Upon
the outer surface of these figures appear small tridents which represent
trees, or rather they may be termed the conventional ornamental figure
evolved from the tree figure or tree design. A simple meander*or
triangle is shown upon the button in plate 50, fig. 2, in which, it will
be observed, the meander is produced by the interdigitation of short
lines attached to the parallel lines within which the meander crosses.

Figs. 3, 4, and 6 have circles with various decorations, that upon fig.
4 being perhaps the flower symbol, described elsewhere in detail.

The ivory button shown in fig. 5 is decorated by simple perforations,
each of which is filled with a wooden peg, the arrangement of the
perforations being regular and symmetrical.

Plate 51 illustrates six forms of bone belt fasteners or toggles.. The
Specimen shown in fig. 1 was collected by Mr. L. M. Turner at Norton
Sound, and measures 2} inches across. Within the upper and lower
margins are five horizontal incised lines, while along the vertical edge
there are but four each. Upon the inner line and directed inward are

short incisions, each one-sixteenth of an inch in length. Surrounding
the central perforation is a quadrilateral figure conforming to the out-
line of the ornament, consisting of three incised lines one-sixteenth of
an inch apart. Upon the inner sides of the square are similar short
lines directed upward toward the interior, as upon the inner line of the
outer square.

In plate 51, fig. 2, also from Norton Sound, the ornamentation con-
sists of eight lines running parallel with the four outer borders, the
interior space about the central perforation being blank.

In plate 51, fig. 3, also from Norton Sound, the ornamentation becomes
alittle more complex. The two sets of parallel lines around the inte-
‘rior form a square. Within each set of lines thus drawn are markings

so placed as to form a crude zigzag resulting from the short lines pro-
jecting alternately outward and inward by a process resembling what
might be termed interdigitation. This has some resemblance to or sug-
gests the Papuan patterns, to which reference is made elsewhere. ‘The
interior space about the central perforation is ornamented by two lines
forming a cross.

In plate 51, fig. 4, there is shown a buckle from Pinuit, Alaska, and
both lines and dots are employed in ornamenting the surface. The
squares are present as in the preceding record, while small perforations
occupy the space between the groups of lines.

In plate 51, fig. 5, from Norton Sound, the outer border consists of
two decorated figures, while surrounding the central perforation are six
concentric rings, four short lines diverging from the outer ring toward
the outer angles of the ornament. From the inner angle of the inner
quadrilateral figure are four short lines, each terminating in a V-shaped
figure, or bifurcation, rudely resembling the conventionalized whale tail,
though in this instance more likely denoting a tree, as it also represents
a conventionalized tree figure.

In plate 51, fig. 6, from Premorska two series of lines are drawn, with
the difference, however, that instead of bearing additional ornamenta-
tion between the two quadrilateral figures the ornamentation consists
of nucleated circles, three upon each side, while within the inner
square and surrounding the central perforation are three concentric
rings. The space beyond the outer ring and the angle of the inner
square is filled with small figures consisting of a spot surrounded by
two concentrie rings.

Upon plate 52 are shown thirteen figures of needle cases or snutf
tubes, upon which are shown various styles of ornamentation. The
specimen at the extreme left, from the Lower Yukon, is octagonal,
while the next shows a series of rings produced by filing, as in the
fourth figure, and to a certain extent inthe last. The encircling hands
upon figs. 5, 6,7, 8, and 9 illustrate in various ways the rudimentary
forms or originals from which have developed that peculiar meander
or zigzag to which reference is made in various places and in various
830 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895

connections, and which has been compared to a certain degree wit
the Papuan ornamentation referred to by Mr. Alfred C. Haddon
Upon the two figures at the right hand are a series of small, nucleated
rings, and particularly in fig. 12 are shown several instances in which
these rings are surrounded by radiating lines, a bottom line extending
to a transverse base line or attached to another nucleated circle of like
form. These may be related to the flower symbols, to which Mr.

Lucien M. Turner makes reference in the letter which I have quoted. —

Plate 35, fig. 9, shows a tobacco box from Sledge Island. Itis arude
imitation of a seal, a small opening being cut in the neck, while the
rear end was at one time undoubtedly closed by means of a wooden
plug. The ornamentation throughout consists of parallel lines between
which theincisions of short transverse lines are so arranged as to indi-
cate the rude meander or zigzag pattern. Upon the back are several
conventional tree patterns.

Plate 25, fig. 1, represents an ivory casket from St. Michaels. If is
made of the upper hollow portion of a walrus tusk and is very pro-
fusely illustrated with the zigzag pattern, borders of which encircle
the specimen both above and below, while around the center is an
almost continuous pattern of six nucleated circles, each connected
with the other by means of continuous strips or zigzag ornamentation.
Between the two outer rims of each of these ornaments we find the
fish trap pattern, in some the plain zigzag, in another short transverse
lines, etc., showing various degrees of ornamentation of the same gen-
eral type. Radiating from the outer circles of all the specimens are
short vertical lines at four opposite points, in imitation of the flower
symbol. On the remaining spaces between this central ornamentation
and the two outer margins are rows of small circles similarly orna-
mented within by concentric rings and upon the outside by radiating
lines.

The round box illustrated in plate 34, fig. 3, is from Norton Sound.
This was used for holding fishing tackle. The top and bottom are
made of wood, while the circular band is made of a flat piece of rein-
deer horn securely lashed together at the joints by means of two iron
and one copper clasp attached longitudinally, The surface of this
band of horn is very neatly ornamented around the upper portion in
zigzag pattern, while the corresponding border below has been left
plain. Between these two borders, howeyer, are a series of figures of
concentric circles very neatly incised and arranged alternately, first a
large circle, then two small ones. Each of these figures is furthermore
ornamented by four radiating lines resembling the flower symbol,
although from the great number of concentric circles within it there
is suggested rather the idea of the symbol used to denote the nests
of kantags or wooden buckets obtained by barter from the Chukchi of
the Asiatic side.

Plate 35, fig. 5, represents a bone ‘‘ mouthpiece” from Diomede
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 831

Island. The ornamentation upon this is rude and deeply incised, con-
sisting of a base line of two parailel incisions, between which is the
rude meander or zigzag, to the top of which are incised at regular inter-
vals trident figures representing the conventional tree symbol. Simi-
lar incisions and markings appear also upon a larger specimen from
the same locality, shown in fig. 7.

Plate 52, fig. 5, shows a specimen without any indication to mark the
locality from which it was obtained, although from its association with
the collections from Alaska it may be inferred that it was made by some
one of the native tribes, very likely the southern or southeastern
natives, who have intermarried with the Thlingit, or possibly the Thlin-
git themselves, although the carving very greatly resembles that copied
after the work of the Haida. In almost any position in which the
specimen may be held faces appear. Upon the lower side is the repre-
sentation of a face the expression of which is exactly like that in fig. 3,
while the front or rounded portion of the ornament shows a perfect
snake’s head, though this was probably intended to represent a seal.
The ornament appears to have been used for attachment to the end of
a cord, probably in harness or on some weapon.

Plate 13 represents three figures of bone seine shuttles or handles
from the Yukon River. The ornamentation upon fig. 1 is very simple.
It consists of diagonal lines between two horizontal ones, with the
exception of a small space about the upper third, where half a dozen
lines cross at the opposite angle. Upon fig. 2 the lines are closer
together, and in the lower figure very short lines are attached so
as to extend at right angles from their respective base lines. These
are of that primary type forming the base of the “fish weir” or ‘fish
trap” pattern, which in turn forms the base of the rude angular mean-
der and ultimately of the zigzag, to which reference is made elsewhere.

In fig. 3 the ornamentation consists first of two horizontal parallel
lines extending along each outer border. Between each pair of lines
are short lines forming zigzags. The interior spaces are filled with
other patterns. At the upper end is an animal, apparently represent-
ing a wolf, with the life line upon the body, while at the lower extremity
is the outline of a beaver. At the two small triangles formed by the
cross lines at the middle of the specimen are two small trees, simply
decorative, and intended to fill the blank space.

Plate 49, fig. 3, represents a very beautiful net shuttle obtained in
the Aleutian Islands by Mr. L. M. Turner. The only ornament of any
consequence on this represents a figure of concentric rings, from which
radiate eight delicate lines. This is probably a highly conventionalized
figure of the flower symbol, though in the pictography of the Ojibwa and
some of the Shoshonian tribes it would denote the symbol of the sun.

The superiority of the workmanship is apparent, and is character-
istic of that of the southern Alaska, or rather the Aleutian, natives.

Plate 23, fig. 1, represents a reel for sinew for small nets, obtained
832 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

at Cape Vancouver, Alaska, by Mr. E. W. Nelson. The specimen is
made of bone, and is decorated with incised lines extending from point
to point along either edge, with interior markings of short lines, as
shown on the specimen.

Plate 23, fig. 4, represents a fishing implement made of reindeer horn,
It is slightly curved and forked at either end, three of the four ends
terminating in heads, probably that of the seal. The chief decoration
consists of a median line extending from end to end, to which are
attached several pairs of characters representing the herring bone
pattern, though with the addition of short outer lines.

The perforation visible in the center is intended for holding a drill.

Plate 35, figs. 1, 2, and 3, represents small ivory thimble holders or
guards. The ornamentation upon these is different, that upon fig. 1
and fig. 2 consisting, respectively, of simple borings or depressions and
concentric rings, while upon fig. 3 appears a continuous line, to which
are attached several pairs of short oblique radiating lines, as in plate
ZO tie.

Plate 35, fig. 4, represents a seine thimble holder from Kushunuk.
This is a rude outline of a seal with the young placed transversely to
its back, while the ornamentation consists of several sizes of concentric
rings, two of which show radiating lines attached to the outer surface.

Plate 35, fig. 6, represents a thimble guard from Unalakleet. The
ornamentation upon this is in imitation of that from the Northwest
Coast northward trom Kotzebue Sound, and consists almost exclusively
of various patterns of the zigzag or meander design.

Plate 23, fig. 3, is marked in the catalogue as a bone grass comb, from
Kotzebue Sound. Mr. Murdoch, who has examined the specimen in
my presence, believes it to be simply an ordinary comb for personal
use. The ornamentation is divided into two panels, separated by four
parallel transverse lines, each about one-eighth of an inch from the
other. Short lines, placed closely side by side, radiate from the inner
lines toward the outer. These inner lines with short radiating lines are
reproduced at either end of the specimen. Reference to the illustra-
tion will more clearly represent this. In the upper panel is the por-
trayal of a whale, with some other lines probably intended to denote
whales, but the figures were not completed. There is also a depression,
which was used for the insertion of the top of a drill. The lower panel
contains several pairs of parallel lines, between which is the rude out-
line of a steamboat representing a revenue cutter.

Plate 49, figs. 1 and 2, represents ivory implements, probably used in
connection with harness. The former is decorated with a series of
nucleated rings, all of one size and apparently made with the same
instrument, while on the latter the rings are replaced by simole per-
forations, some of which are about one-eighth of an inch in depth and
were subsequently filled with a hard gummy substance. The most of
them have now become emptied of this material.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 833

The representation of the two snow shovels, fig. 40 @ and b, is to
indicate the manner of attaching the ivory cutting edges upon which
some of the engravings described are found. The wooden portion is
generally made of spruce; the several pieces comprising the shovel, as
above shown, are secured together by means of sinew braid. They are
used for all kinds of shoveling in the snow, and sometimes for excavat-
ing in snowdrifts, for making pitfalls for game, ete. The edge of the
wood is fitted with a tongue into a groove in the top of the ivory edge,
which is 15 inches deep. It is fastened on by wooden treenails at

men measures 2.6 inches in length, and is made of an ivory head fitted
into a handle of wood painted red. ‘The head was called a ‘dog, but
it looks more like a bear. Small bits of wood are inlaid for the eyes,
and the outline of the mouth is deeply incised and colored with red

The ears, nostrils, vebrisse, and hairs on the muzzle are indicated by
blackened incisions. There is an ornamented collar round the neck, to
which is joined a conventional pattern of triangular form on the throat
and a somewhat similar pattern on the ton of the head between the
ears.”

Ornamentation of utensils is carried on to an almost unlimited degree, ©
and the simple nucleated circle occurs very frequently, in fact in pre-.
ference, in some portions of Alaska, to the arrowhead and herringbone
designs.

From Point Barrow we have a twister for working the sinew backing

rings.!. The specimen is of ivory, and measures 5.4 inches long. Itis
one of a pair, as two pieces constitute a set. ]

In fig. 43 is represented a good example of a native dipper made of
fossil ivory. The decoration along the top of the straight flat handle
and around the upper part of the outside of the bowl consists of |
nucleated circles. These were originally colored with red ocher, but
are filled with dirt, while those upon the handle are, to a great extent,
almost effaced by wear.

Upon fig. 44, representing a knife with a handle made of reindeer

lines. The ornamentation extends horizontally along the top and sides,
the incisions having originally been colored with red ocher, but at
present contain more dirt than ocher.’

Another interesting specimen of workmanship, bearing ornamenta-
tion of the same character as the preceding, is shown in fig. 45, and
consists of a chisel. The small blade has an oblique tip, not beveled
to an edge, and is hafted in walrus ivory, yellow from age. The
nucleated rings are colored with red ocher, and the two halves of the
handle are fastened together by a stout wooden treenail and a stitch of
whalebone.!

The accompanying illustration of the foreshaft of a seal dart, fig. 46,

The ornamentation is confined almost wholly to the nucleated circles,
the only animate object portrayed being a deer. It is said that some
of these shafts are highly ornamented, the figures being all incised
and colored, some with ocher and some with soot.

The specimen shown on plate 53 represents a decorated hunting hat
from Katmai Island, Cooks Inlet, Alaska, and was collected by Mr.
W. J. Fisher.

like figure, black. The interior spaces between the black lines just
named are filled in with dark or dirty vermilion.

Beads of dark blue, black, and white constitute portions of the
decorations, while the projecting lines denote the application of sea-
lion bristles, over several of which beads have been slipped.

The chief purpose of here representing the specimen is to show the
place of attaching the decorated bone ornaments illus-
trated on plate 52. The strips of bone are but one-eighth
of an inch in thickness, yet there are a number of per-
forations along the top curve and outer edge, in which
were inserted bristles secured by small wooden pegs.

The ornamental slab of bone attached to the right
side of the hat is decorated with oblique grooves, about
one-half an inch apart, between which are
rows of dots or complete perforations.

Upon the left side of the hat the bone
slab was split from near the top to the bot-
tom, while the diagonal grooves were util-
ized to carry threads beneath the level
of the outer surface to hold together the
pieces from completely separating.
pee Ct Upon the upper part of the back of the

ratep Hanpixe, hat are two arrowheaded ornaments, each

1? inches in length and projecting at right
angles from the wooden base, each being decorated with
nucleated rings, those on the central rows of four each
measuring three-sixteenths inch in diameter, while the
outer rows of three rings each are but one-eighth of an
inch each.

The two ends of the piece of which the hat is made are
held together by means of a piece of wood 54 inches long
and Jess than an inch in width, placed horizontally at
the back and bearing perforations along the central line,
through which a sea lion’s whisker has been passed in
imitation of stitching, thus securing the ends with a per-
fectness to almost resemble a continuous piece of wood.

The decorations vary according to the owner’s skill and
taste, and are used in canoe trips to protect the eyes from
the glare of light and to permit more intent gazing for
the marine animals sought. Ege:

In plate 54 are three examples of Eskimo bone earv- a ee
ing, the outer ones being charms and ornaments for attachment to the
hunting hats, an illustration of which, together with the method of
attachment, is shown in plate 53.

The specimen at the left of the plate, as viewed by the reader, was
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson at Shaktolik. It is of bone, and is deco-

rated with three round pieces connected above and below by permit-
ting the original bone to remain intact while the intervening portions
were removed. The disks are each ornamented with five nucleated
circles, the central spots being perforations of uniform diameter.
Among these rings are three incised lines, darkened by dirt.

The specimen at the right side of the plate is from St. Michaels,
Norton Sound, and was collected by Mr. L. M. Turner. The specimen
is also of bone, and the decorations are alike on either side. This also
is a charm for use on hunting hats.

The specimen in the center of the plate is of thin strip of bone, to
be used for a similar purpose as the two preceding in ornamenting
hunting hats. The specimen is marked “ National Museum, No. 5604,
Premorska, Yukon River,” and was collected by Thomas Dennison.
The nucleated circles upon the specimen have running upward straight
lines, bifurcated at the top in imitation of one variety of the tree sym-
bol, while midway between the top and bottom are like projecting lines
as at the top. At the lower extremity of the specimen is a simple form
of decoration, consisting of a horizontal line from which short lines are
projecting.

Plate 7 represents three forms of ivory arrow and spear straighten-
ers from three different localities and bearing different forms of decora-
tion. The specimen at the left side of the plate was collected by Mr.
K. W. Nelson at Diomede Islands, a locality occupying a position mid-
way between the American and Asiatic continents. It measures 8}
inches in extreme length, 13 inches across the widest part, and has an
average thickness of five-eighths of an inch. The perforation with
which the weapons to be straightened are held is at an angle of almost
45 degrees, as compared with the plane of length of the piece.

The rear or convex part is plain, but upon the slightly concave front
is an engraving of a reindeer. The lines seem to be partly filled in
with dirt, the result of use, and not with black coloring matter placed
there with intention to intensify the sketch.

The slight depression which appears lower down upon the handle is
intended to be used in drilling, the top of the drill being held vertical
by being inserted in the cavity, while the opposite end may be intended
for drilling holes, or for fire making.

Another specimen is that at the right, also collected by Mr. Nelson,
though at Cape Darby. This specimen, intended for similar service as
the preceding, is shaped like the body of a deer with the doe’s head at
one end, while the eyes are two blue beads neatly inserted in holes.
Like the preceding, some traces of hunting records are retained, the
incisions in several places being almost obliterated by long. continued
use. At one place a native is represented as directing a gun toward a
reindeer, while in front of the latter are several lines indicating that
another specimen of the same species was to be engraved, but not
completed. Almost beneath the hunter is a rectangular figure, to one
838 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

end of which is attached a mammal, which, though relatively small,
appears to represent a bear.

Upon the opposite side of the specimen, which is brownish yellow
from age, are a number of delicate lines, some of which clearly por-
tray habitations, a tree, two men, and a sledge with two dogs.

Along the back of the specimen, representing the spine of the ani-
mal imitated, are two parallel lines extending’ backward toward the
lozenge-shaped perforation used for straightening weapons. The per-
foration, as in the preceding example, is also cut through at an angle,
though only about 12 or 15 degrees variance from the line of the longest
diameter. The entire length is 43 inches.

The middle specimen is from Nubriukhchuguluk, and was secured
by Mr. Nelson. The form is greatly like that of a common steel car-
riage wrench. It is made of bone, and the four sides of the handle

bear longitudinal lines with lateral cuts, so placed as to resemble
arrowheaded or >-shaped figures. The type of decoration being one of
the oldest and simplest, will be found more fully treated and illustrated
in connection with the subject of decoration and conventionalizing.

The specimen is apparently a very old one, archeologically, and
shows traces of long-continued or rough usage.

Plate 49, fig. 6, shows an ornament for attachment to the cap used
by Aleut hunters, as is shown in plate 53. This specimen was obtained
at Kushunuk. The ornamentation consists of very strongly incised
concentric rings, to the outer one of which are attached two parallel
lines extending diagonally toward the base line, possibly with the
intention of filling the blank triangular space, which would otherwise
remain without markings.

Many of the so-called drill bows in the collection of the National
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 839

Museum are, in reality, handles for carrying tool and other bags. The
Point Barrow collection contains four such bags, and as Mr. Murdoch’s
description is short and to the point, I can not do better than to quote
him. Hesays:

These bags are always made of skin with the hair out, and the skins of wolver-
ines’ heads are the most desired for this purpose.! [Fig. 47.]

The bottom of the bag is-a piece of short-haired brown deerskin, with the hair
out, pierced across the middle, The sides and ends are made of the skins of four
wolverine heads, without the lower jaw, cut off at the nape and spread out and
sewed together side by side with the hair outside and noses up. One head comes to
each end of the bag and each side, and the spaces between the noses are filled out
with gussets of deerskin and wolverine skin. A narrow strip of the latter is sewed
round the mouth of the bag. The handle is of walrus ivory, 144 inches long and
about one-half inch square. There is a vertical hole through it one-half inch from
each end, and at one end also a transverse hole between this and the tip. One end
of the thong which fastens the handle to the bag is drawn through this hole and cut
off close tothe surface. The other end is brought over the handle and down through
the vertical hole and made fast with two half stitches into a hole through the
septum of the nose of the head at one endof the bag. The other end of the handle is
fastened to the opposite nose in the same way, but the thong is secured in the hole
by a simple knot in the end above. On one side of the handle is an ‘unfinished
incised pattern.

Many of these bag handles are decorated on two, three, or even all four
sides, when they are so fashioned, although some are convex above, as
well as below, leaving but two sides upon which to engrave anything.

Another variety of decorated handles are those used in small bags,
meaning but one-quarter the size of the one above described.

In addition to the incised ornamentation, both decorative and his-
torical or mythologic, many of the small bag handles are carved with
whale flukes, bear heads, seal heads, and other objeets, as will be
found upon examining various illustrations in the present paper.

DECORATION OF ANIMAL *CARVINGS.

As in the preceding methods of decorating ornaments, various animal
carvings, effigies, toys, etc., are also ornamented, the artistic efforts
being directed, in many instances, to heighten the resemblance to the
prototype selected. Thus are attempted the indication of spots, stripes,
and scales upon animals and fish, the results being often very clever.

Plate 53, fig. 1, shows a specimen which was obtained at Sledge
Island. It is a very ornamental handle for packages or bags, to either
end of which is attached a short chain. One of these chains terminates
in a seal head. The links were cut from the same piece as the handle
itself. The separate attachments to which the package is fastened
consist of two small swivels, or pins, perforated below aud terminating
on top in carved seal heads, the ears, eyes, nostrils, and mouth of which
are clearly indicated. The ornamentation upon the top of the handle
consists of four small characters of the primary form of decoration

‘Ninth Annual Report Bureau of Ethnology, 1887-88. 1892, pp. 187, 188, fig. 166.

840 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

previously referred to, and illustrated in plate 48, figs. 1 and 2, and plate
dl, fig. 2.

Plate 55, fig. 2, is another kantag handle, and was obtained at Norton
Sound. It is very old, measures 64 inches in length, and is ornamented
upon the upper surface with two rows of seal heads in relief, each row
consisting of fifteen heads, upon which are indicated the eyes. At
either end are the relief figures of two whales flanking the perforations
through which the cords are passed.

Plate 32, fig. 3, represents two ear pendants. Very quaint faces are
inclosed by nee from which project four small circles or knobs with
central indentations. The eyes, nose, and mouth very much resemble
the face of a seal, the forehead being ornamented by small punctures.
This closely resembles the carved ivory seal faces in fig. 6, in which the
punctures are placed upon the cheeks to indicate the root of the whis-
kers. Above the eyes are markings to denote the eyebrows. In other
respects the faces are very human. These faces resemble to some
extent that shown in fig. 7, although it will be observed that in the
latter the nostrils are very definitely outlined, while beneath the mouth
are two pairs of descending lines to indicate tattoo marks.

Plate 56, fig. 2, represents an effigy of a seal. The concentric circles
are or Nopncnred on the outer side with three short radiating lines and a
longer base line in exact imitation of the common flower symbol which
itis undoubtedly intended to represent. The central perforations made
by the central pin of the tool used in making the symbols are closed
with wooden blocks which secure small bunches of bristles. Altogether
the specimen is very artistically made.

Plate 56, fig. 3, shows a belt clasp. This represents a seal. Upon
the side of the eae is a large figure of concentric rings, to either side
of which are three small sets. The central one is furthermore orna-
mented with four short radiating lines attached to the outer ring, while
the small circles are decorated with short radiating lines, the upper one
being represented by pairs, while the bottom line is represented by two
lines; yet the figures appear to be the same as the conventional flower
symbol, which may have been utilized in this instance to ornament the
body of the animal, as in the preceding case.

Plate 26, fig. 3, represents a seal drag from St. Michaels. The thong
is made of rawhide, and the instrument is used for dragging dead seals.
It is made of walrus ivory, and represents two seal heads, the eyes and
nostrils being clearly indicated, not only by perforations, but in one
ease the perforations are filled with wooden pegs, and the other the
eyes are filled with beads. Upon the throat of each seal is the effigy of
a whale, very neatly carved, and partly detached to add to its relief.
The perforation extends through the mouth of the seal at the right
hand, for the admission of a noose or cord. Upon the upper surface of
the drag concentric rings are seen.

used for attaching cord and for dragging seals. The ornamentation
consists of sharply marked nucleated circles. The specimen is from
Kotzebue Sound, and is considerably ruder and less artistic than the
other specimens in this series.

In plate 56, fig. 5, is reproduced the effigy of a walrus. The speci-
men was obtained at Nashagak by Mr. EK. L. McKay. As in figs. 2 and
3, the body is ornamented with concentric rings, to the outer of each
of which are radiating lines, almost like the conventional flower symbol,
and possibly intended for the same. Extending horizontally between
these “circle markings” are rows of small perforations, or drilled holes,
simply to serve as ornaments. The peculiar marking upon the top of
the head, which no doubt is intended to represent the wrinkles or folds
of the skin, is also the rude symbol of the female genitals as drawn by
the Eskimo, and of which one single instance is found in the collec-
tions of the National Museum, and is reproduced in fig. 48,

Plate 41, fig. 1, is an ivory wedge used for splitting wal-
rus hide. The tool is made in imitation of an otter, the
back and eyes having incised nucleated rings, with radii,
which are connected by dines. The back bears, within the
parallel space, some herringbone patterns similar to those
on the figures shown on the same plate (41), figs. 3 and 4. — Fis-48-

Plate 54, fig. 1, represents a carving of an otter. The arti “NS °F
cle served as an ornament, but for what special purpose is
not known. As will be noted by reference to the illustration, the back
from the neck to the base of the tail bears a deep incision, through
which were made several perforations for attaching it by means of
cords to some other object. Within the concentric circles are blue
glass beads which have been inserted in the perforations left by the
tool used in making the rings. The eyes are also provided with small
glass beads. All the lines and markings have been filled in with some
black coloring matter.

Plate 57, fig. 6, represents a beaver, upon whose back is the outline
of a smaller beaver. Over the whole are ornamental lines crossing one
another at right angles.

Comparison may be made with an effigy of a seal, upon whose back,
transversely and in relief, is a young one; both parent and young being
decorated, the former with concentric rings.

Plate 26, fig. 2, represents a bag handie from the Lower Yukon.
The specimen is almost semicircular, and measures 9 inches across from
point to point, and 4 inches in height. The upper or convex side has
high relief carvings representing bears’ heads, nine in number, the
eyes and nostrils being pronounced perforations, while upon the fore-
head of each is a sharply defined cross. Along the upper edge, corre-
sponding to the necks of the bears, are the deeply cut figures of six
bears, and continued around to the inside of the handle, and con-
nected with the necks of three of the bears, are the figures of trees.

i)
842 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Immediately below the bears’ heads are the figures of seventeen seals,
to the back ef each of which is a diagonal line to represent a harpoon,
while transversely to the latter is shown the cord. These resemble a
general attempt at ornamentation, the uniformity of drawing appear-
ing to substantiate this belief.

Plate 57 represents a number of figures of animals and fish, all of
them toys, with the exception of fig. 4, which is a drag handle. Fig. 1
represents a flounder, and is ornamented with delicate incisions and
radiating lines for fins. Fig. 2 shows an ivory carving representing
seals and ornamented with delicate punctures and incised lines. Fig. 3
is an effigy of a seal with the head portion plain while the back is
ornamented with triangular marks as if made with single incisions of
a three-cornered graver. Fig. 4, already reterred to, represents a seal,
the ornamentation consisting of curved parallel lines within which are
short diagonal lines extending from each parallel line toward the other.

Plate 57, fig. 5, represents the beluga, with very rude markings upon
the back.

The Kantag or bag handle shown in plate 58, fig. 3, is in imitation of a
beluga whale, while the back of the neck also bears a rude outline of
such amammal. The shoulder bears a transverse bar within which is
a meandering line extending from side to side of the animal; behind
this are the figures of four “killer” whales, while near the rear end of
the figure itself is the upper part of a bowhead whale shown with
water spouting.

Plate 55, fig. 3, represents a kantag handle from Sledge Island. The
decoration consists of figures of four right whales carved transversely,.
two at either end. From the ends of the handle are suspended, in the
shape of links, other whales, while upon the middle of the handle are
engraved delicate outlines of two whales facing each other.

Plate 41, fig. 6, represents a bodkin, the point consisting of part of
a three-cornered file while the other end terminates in a short chain.
The last link represents a fish tail and is ornamented with nucleated
circles, while the handle of the instrument bears a series of nucleated
rings with short radiating lines, representing the flower symbol, as in
plate 15, fig. 4, though larger.

Plate 57, fig. 7, represents a grayling, though in reality the shape
and pronounced decoration of the upper half of the body represents
more nearly the salmon. It will be noticed that the median line is
ornamented with other lateral incisions in imitation of the “fish trap”
pattern, while the fins are very pronounced and consist of sharply
marked serrations, resembling one-half of the preceding pattern.

Plate 5/7, fig. 8, represents a fish, the dorsal markings consisting of
hatched lines. This probably represents a salmon.

PICTOGRAPHS OF DOMESTIC AVOCATIONS.

The greater number of the records appear to come under this general
caption, together with which some hunting scenes are included. The
various forms of habitations used by the Eskimo are also here referred
to, rather than in the previous chapters in connection with the geo-
graphic location and environment of the several subtribes or settle-
ments, because comparisons may here be made between, the forms or
outlines of houses, sledges, and possibly also canoes, to show the
degree of fidelity of reproduction of specific peculiarities of either of
the last named.

HABITATIONS AND CONVEYANCE.

In his reference to the dwellings of the Eskimo generally, Mr.
Petroft! speaks of the winter and summer habitations as being quite
distinct from one another. The former being underground to a cer-
tain extent, having a mound-shaped appear-
ance with a ridge projecting for some distance,
beneath which is the entrance, is closely imi-
tated in the pictographs by the natives. The
smoke holes are in the top of the dome, or near
the center, for the escape of the smoke. The
common houses, on the other hand, are inclosed Fig. 49.
above ground, and partake of the nature of a PW#'1ING rkom cHUcKCaE YEAR
log structure covered with skins, and some- sey
times of an ordinary tent-shaped shelter. The fire is built not within
the tent, but before the entrance. This feature is also carefully observed
in the etchings made by the native artist, and numerous examples are
given in illustration thereof.

A larger building, known as the kashqa, is found in almost every
village, built after the pattern of the winter habitation. A raised
platform runs all around the interior for seating the visitors, and on
some of the larger kashqas several such tiers have been observed.
These structures are generally used for ceremonial observances. An
illustration of the ground plan of such an inclosure, made by a native,
is reproduced in fig. 49.

In fig. 49 is the outline of a dwelling reproduced from plate 81,
which constitutes a Chuckche “year record.” The original was obtained
by Baron Nordenski6ld in Siberia, and is now in the possession of a
gentleman in England. The pictographs were drawn upon a piece of
walrus hide.

In the interior, at the left,is shown the ridge intended for seats or
Sleeping places. The occupant seated upon it appears to be gesticu-
lating and in conversation with his companions.

A similar drawing in fig. 50 shows this seat also. This sketch is

WINTER HABITATION, WITH WOOD CHOPPER AT WORK. € 6
In fig. 51 are repre-

sented two forms, almost identical, of structures made for white men,
to serve as trading establishments as well as sleeping quarters. The
outline in some pictographs of traders possesses one more nearly like a
one-story log house.

On one of the ivory bodkins shown in plate 24, fig. 5, the triangular
figures with diagonal projecting lines on either side near the top are
outlines of summer habitations, the utilization of which for apparently
purely decorative purposes being probably prompted by the regular and
angular forms, straight lines being preferable and more desirable for
such ornamental engraving, as curved lines are foreign to the primitive
straight-line system, largely attributable to the kind of instruments
available and the generally difficult nature of the substance to be
worked or engraved.

In plate 59, fig. 4, is another and ruder form of indicating the same
style of summer habitation, the variants in plate 59, fig. 2, being also
more explanatory in detail, and of interest as indicating a departure
in engraving from the original type of a tent shelter, the light lines
diverging from near the top denoting the poles, over which some skins |
or imported fabrics have been thrown.

In plate 60 are a number of illustrations of native pursuits. In the
fifth line, or No. 5, are shown some delicately engraved figures.

Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7,9, 10, and i2 represent habitations of several kinds, of
each of which the village is composed. The occupant at the entrance
to No. 1 is employed in suspending from a pole—to the left of the house
No, 3—some meat, probably fish. Festoons of the same kind of food,
for the purpose of drying, are sus-
pended from the food racks shown in
Nos. 4,6, and 8 and on the horizontal
pole resting on the roofs of the two
houses at Nos.9 and 10. A granary ae es ws
is also indicated in No. 8, the stair- ae 7
way beneath being plainly shown. The occupants of the houses Nos.
9 and 10 are also occupied with domestic duties. Fig. 11 represents
the boat, placed upon a rack so as to dry the skin covering.

The summer habitation (No. 12) has an open door at one side, and to

the right is seated one of the household (No. 13) employed in stirring
some food ina kettle. The smoke (No. 14) is rising toa considerable
height, and another pot or kettle is seen to the right. The native
shown in No. 15 is greatly excited, having both hands, with extended
fingers, thrown upward, the cause being seen in an old man drag-
ging ashore a walrus, which is being harpooned by No. 17. The old
age of the native (No. 16) is indicated by his walking with a staff, this
method of portraying an old person being common in many portions
of the world, the Egyptian hieroglyphs abounding in characters
almost identical to the one here shown. The walrus (No. 19) is also
shown as having been captured, the native in No. 21 having con-
siderable difficulty in dragging it ashore, as he is down on one knee
tugging at the harpoon line, while a companion is observed near him
(No. 22), aiding him.

Fic. 20 is the outline of a doe, which was also secured. No. 235 denotes
a dog, while Nos. 24 and 25 indicate two other natives.

Anexcellent illustration of the different methods of portraying canoes
and houses is given in plate 60, seventh line, the whole scene denoting
a native village situated near the water. Upon the canoe (No. 21) is a
‘shaman stick,” or votive offering, erected to the memory of the one
who owned the scaffold, and perhaps canoe as well. Another offering
of similar purport is erected upon the roof of the house No. 10. One
showing the same fan-like top will be found in connection with mortuary
customs.

At No.4 the native is putting away something resembling a pole,
while at No. 6 the two men seem to be engaged in conversation con-
cerning the canoe, the one nearest to it having his right hand pointing
toward or touching it.

The winter habitations, with their entrances, are portrayed in a
manner different from the usual custom. The entrance is very pro-
jecting, and apparently overhanging.

Smoke is seen issuing from the apex, chimney, or funnel containing
asmoke hole, on the house No. 12. A food scaffold, known by the vertical
poles projecting considerably above the transverse body, is shown in
No. 13, while beyond is what appears to be another scaffold. The
erosion to which the ivory has been subjected has obliterated all other
parts of the figure.

A very common figure is that resembling an oblong box placed upon
upright poles, in reality a scaffold, upon which is built a storehouse for
the protection against noxious animals. . These figures are usually
placed near the representation of the dome-shaped winter habitation,
as each family has such a storehouse.

Other seaffold-like structures also occur, and frequently the kaiak or
umiak, placed upon the scaffold for drying, may be mistaken for one of
these, which, in reality, are the resting place of some human body.
This practice is not common everywhere, however.
846 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In some ethnographic ‘“* Memoranda concerning the arctic Eskimos in
Alaska and Siberia,” by Mr. John W. Kelly,' an interpreter, says:

The Eskimo oomeaks (open boats) have a framework of spruce covered with split
walrus hides, sea-lion skins, or white grampus skins. The latter is not used if sea-
lion or walrus skins are obtainable, as itis rather thin. The Bering Strait and north-
coast boats are generally 24 feet long with 5 feet beam, and have a carrying capacity
of 15 persons and 500 pounds of freight.

Those of the Kotzebue Sound average about 35 feet in length and 6 feet in width.
They have a carrying capacity of 20 persons and 1,000 pounds of freight, or 3,000
pounds of merchandise and a crew of 6 men. There are exceptional boats built on
the sound that are as much as 42 feet over all. In crossing Kotzebue Sound or
Bering Strait the natives sew on bulwarks of sea-lion skins a foot high to keep the
water from dashing in.

Mr. Ivan Petroff,? who spent a number of years in various portions
of Alaska, in an official capacity, says of the vessels of the Eskimo:

All the Eskimo tribes, without exception, manufacture and use the skin canoe
known as the kaiak, identical with that of the eastern or Greenland Eskimo; and
this feature is so distinctive and exclusive that a tribal name might justly be based
upon it should the necessity arise for another. At present I know of only one

instance where an intermixture of the Innuit with another tribe has taken place ©

Fig. 52.
MODEL KAIAK AND DOUBLE PADDLE, POINT BARROW.

under such circumstances that the foreign element has gained the upper hand, and
there they have already abandoned the manufacture of the kaiak and apparently
forgotten the art of its construction. I refer to the Oughalakhmute, who have
mixed with the Thlinket. The open skin boat, the oomiak, or woman’s boat, also
known as Didar, is used by certain tribes on the north coast of Asia; but the kaiak
proper is only found among the Eskimo.

When the Russians first observed this craft, they applied to it the name of bidarka,
a diminutive of bidar, a Kamchatkan term for an open skin boat. This term is now
used throughout Alaska wherever Russian influence once predominated, and the
same word has been incorporated into several Eskimo dialects in the form of bidali,
which is, however, applied only to two and three hatch kaiaks—a variety formerly
known only on the Aleutian Islands, and adopted by the Russians for greater con-
venience in hunting and traveling. From Bristol Bay westward and northward the
kaiak and oomiak only are‘used.

The accompanying illustration serves to show the general form of the

ivory that its representation here will be of interest in showing how
accurately the native artist portrays even the tapering form of the
blades.

KATAK. KAIAKS.

On plate 27 is shown an illustration of a native kaiak model.

Several forms of the native portrayal of kaiaks are shown in figs. 53
and 54. The first is a simple outline and incomplete, and an occupant
was evidently intended to be portrayed, as al] the remaining portion of
the record from which it was selected was complete in every detail. The
two illustrations in fig. 54 are less accurate in outline, the latter being
a simple group of scratches.

The specimen shown in fig. 55 is very accurately drawn, the harpoon
and seal float being shown upon the kaiak immediately behind the
hunters.

The representation of large boats used for traveling, hunting, and
fishing, for the propulsion of which boat oars and sails may be used, is of
such frequent occurrence in the records of the Eskimo,
that a reference to the vessel and its actual appearance
is deemed appropriate.

This large skin-covered open boat is in general use
by the natives of Greenland and Alaska, as well as by
the Aleuts and some Siberian tribes. The vessel is designated as the
umiak, by the Point Barrow natives, and some of the Aigaluxamiut, of
the southern coast, have used this name as well as the term baidarka.

Fig. 56 represents a model of an umiak from Utkiavwin, U.S. N. M.,
No. 56563,' and seems to illustrate the general form so closely followed
in the engravings by native artists. The natives sit with the face
toward the bow, using the paddle and not an oar. The women are

said by Egede, in his “Greenland” (p. 111), to sit with the face toward
the stern, ‘“‘rowing with long oars.” Mr. Murdoch? remarks with refer-
ence to this that ‘“‘though the women do a great share of the work of

navigating the boat when a single family or a small party is making
journey, it is by no means considered a woman’s boat, as appears to b
the case among the Greenlanders and the eastern Eskimo generally.
On the contrary, women are not admitted into the regularly organizec
whaling crews, unless the umialik can not procure men enough, and in
the ‘seratch’ crews assembled for walrus hunting or sealing there are”

usually at least as many men_
~. . aS women,and the men work as
hard as the women.”

This is mentioned to explain
the reason why the female fig-
ure is absentin records of hunt-
ing and fishing trips, although present in other scenes, such as domestic
and probably ceremonial records.

Plate 28 represents an illustration of a native model from Alaska.

A native drawing of the umiak with four hunters is shown in fig. 57.
The lines are heavily incised, and blackened. The men are without
paddles, which may have been an oversight on the part of the artist.
The spear or harpoon rest is also shown, as well

as the weapon itself. AL
A lessearefully drawn illustration of an umiak

is shown in fig. 58. The three occupants are gras
without paddles. Still ruder form is shown in =
fig. 59, where an attempt at throwing a harpoon at a whale is also shown.

In fig. 60 is reproduced a still rader drawing of an umiak, no hunter
being shown, yet the record in which this vessel occurs is of a class,
or in that condition of completeness, that should also have present the
occupant.

A better illustration of an umiak, containing five people, is shown in
fig. 61. The lines are lightly incised.

A neatly executed sketch of an umiak is illustrated in fig. 62. The
bow is longer than usual, and also projects from the water.

Two varieties

of sledges are

by the Eskimo,

oneof them being

the railed sledge

(fig. 63), used for carrying loads of articles belonging to camp equipage,

ete., while the other pertains to a low flat sledge, without rails (fig. 64),!

and used for carrying bulky objects, such as game, frozen seals, and, as

Mr. Murdoch informs us, for transporting the umiak across the land or

solidice. Both are made without nails, the different parts being mortised
together and lashed ove with eee of thong and ee

The runners are made to slide easily by fitting to them shoes of clear
ice as long as the runners themselves, “ fully 1 foot high by 6 inches
thick. The sledge, with these ice runners, is estimated to weigh, even
when unloaded, upward of 200 or 300 pounds; but it appears that the
smoothness of running more than counterbalances the extra weight.”!

The flat sledge is used also for ordinary travel as well as freight, and
an illustration of one with ivory runners
is shown in fig. 65,

The difference between these varieties
are often very neatly portrayed, as well
as other accessories pertaining thereto. eee

Doctor Dall furnishes several illustra- ay gaat
tions of sledges,” one from Norton Sound being like the railed sledge of
Point Barrow. Some difference, however, is apparent, and this may
naturally influence the portrayal of the vehicle in engravings on ivory.
The same author also furnishes the illustration of a Hudson Bay sledge
in which the runners are absent, the entire base consisting of birch
boards, three of which are laid side by side and secured, and about 12
feet long. These are cut thin at one end and turned over like a tobog-

gan, held down with rawhide, and inside

RR the curve, says Doctor Dall, the voyageur
carries his kettle.

Fig. 61.
UMIAK.

The railed sledge of the Yukon is some-
what different from the two forms already
mentioned, the upper rail rising from the front toward the back, and
resembling very much a native sketch of a dog sledge, as shown in fig. 66.
The hunter seems to be seated upon the sledge, seeming to indicate that
he has no other loads and that the rear projection on the sledge is the
high framework shown in the Yukon type.

In fig. 67 is a native reproduction of a dog sledge made somewhat
after the type of the Point Barrow type,
though no such drawings have been found bp baie
in Point Barrow records. The men are both
energetically working to aid the dog in moy- Big. G2,
ing the sledge, which seems loaded. The eee
dog is well portrayed, the ragged outline no doubt being intended to
denote the shaggy coat of hair.

In his reference to the Eskimo of Melville Peninsula, Captain Parry
Says 33

The distance to which these people extend their inland immigrations and the
extent of coast of which they possess a personal knowledge are really very remark-

able. Of these we could at the time of our first intercourse form no correct judgment,
from our uncertainty as to the length of what they call a seenik (sleep), or one day’s

journey, by which alone they could describe to us, with the help of their imperfect
arithmetic, the distance from one place to another. But our subsequent knowledge
of the coast has cleared up much of this difficulty, affording the means of applying
to their hydrographical sketches a tolerably accurate scale for those parts which we

have not hitherto visited.

RAILED SLEDGE. POINT BARROW.

In the following description tents, habitations, and boats are illus-
trated, as also some domestic avocations, as might be expected in the
representation of village life.

Quite an interesting result is produced in plate 60, fig. 6, or sixth line,
the drawing representing the outlines of the houses so that the inte-
rior, with the occupants variously engaged, is exposed to view.

SMALL SLEDGE WITH IVORY RUNNERS. POINT BARROW.

No. 2 is a rack, with food or goods on top, while at No. 3 is the first
house of the village—the latter being indicated by the several habita-
tions. One of the occupants is seated upon an elevated ledge or seat,
while another is seated on the floor before it; the other inmates are

either seated or moving about as indicated. Upon the roof is a votive
offering, a bird-shaped “shaman stick,” the import of which is else-
where described in detail. Still more of the family are seen at the
entrance to the house, one person within, while two are upon the roof.
In the storehouse, or rather beneath the goods, No. 5, is visible a dog
fight, the animals being drawn in the attitude of springing at one
another; at the right is the owner occupied
in removing some article from the scaffold.

In the habitation No. 6, with its entrance
No. 7, are a number of persons in various atti-
tudes. One is reclining upon the elevated
shelf used for both seat and bed; while upon the floor are three seated
at a table, those behind it being represented or partly hidden, the upper
parts of their bodies only rising above the board. A number of other
individuals are shown occupied in other ways. The scaffold at No. 8
supporting the goods, as usually represented, has also a horizontal pole
for drying meat, several pieces thereof being designated, while two
persons beneath seem to be touching hands or handing some article.

The habitation No. 9, and its entrance No. 10, also indicates a num-
ber of the inmates. One in particular is making gestures to another;
between the two there is an object resembling a person as if wrapped
in a blanket. Smoke is seen issuing from the smoke hole, while above
it is what may be here intended the evil spirit of a dead person return-
ing to take possession of a sick one.

The Eskimo generally believe in the return of the soul of the dead,
and especially does the disembodied spirit hover around the house a
the dead for three days, in the endeavor to return and to possess itself
of a living body. In the purpose of guarding against this evil, the
inmates make certain shamanistic preparations, prompted by the local
Shaman. The smoke issuing from the mouth of the smoke hole leaves
open the way for the return of the evil spirit and his companion spirit,
seen approaching from above the house.

No. 11 represents a scaffold for the storage of food, and a man is
seen in the act of reaching toward the black spot denoting reindeer or
venison house, as the shape indicates.

No. 12 is another interesting in-
terior, one native being seated upon
the ledge while a vessel is seen near
his feet. Another man is reaching
toward something near the ceiling,
while the rest of the occupants of the room are seated, one of them
reaching up toward the standing figure as in the act of asking for, or
supplication. Smoke is issuing from the smoke hole, while some one is
occupied near the fire beneath it. A ladder is placed against the out-
side of the entrance to the house, and a man is seen part way up near
another person who seems to be occupied in gesture and conversation.

Another man is seen carrying a snowshoe-like object, probably of rein-
deer or deer, to the summit of the house roof to dry. The pole, with
crosspiece, situated near the head of the ladder, is a votive offering
erected there by one of the inmates.

No. 13-is a sledge, upon which is seated the driver using his whip.
The dog is urged forward, and another native, one of the three, No. 14,
who had been off trading for skins, is hailing a boat seen coming to
the shore with the gunwale parallel therewith, pre-
senting another good instance of foreshortening of
, the object. The man behind the sledge is walking
ie 8: along with his staff elevated. ‘The inverted figure

eee Ty above seems to belong to a series attempted on
that side of the panel of the bow drill, as another figure, having no
apparent connection with the completed record, occurs also at a point
over the three wading boatmen following the baidarka, No. 16, which
is being pushed ashore. No. 17 is also in shallow water and appears to
start away as the oarsmen are seated within with their arms extended
grasping the paddle.

An interesting and cleverly drawn native sketch of a man mending
a seine net is shown in fig. 68. The attitude is lifelike, while in one
hand is portrayed a short line denoting the shuttle.

A man splitting wood is shown in the accompanying illustration,
fig. 69. He has a heavy mallet or some other like utensil raised above
his head, and in the act of driving wedges to split a piece of wood.

Plate 59, fig. 4, represents an old stained specimen of ivory from
Norton Sound. The engravings upon this are rather deep, and are
filled with deep brown coloring matter. The semicircular objects to
the right of the middle, some being shown in rather an angular form
toward the left of the middle, represent habitations. These characters
appear in a more conventionalized form and for decorative purposes in
plate 24, fig. 5.

The chief interest attached to this record is in the variety of forms
of habitations, thus enabling one to perceive the differences in the
variants placed in consecutive order. The two
extremes are very unlike, and would scarcely be
recognized as portraying a similar idea, but for the
intervening examples showing the evolution in the
execution of form. Fig. 69.

The two elongated figures to the right of the habi- BEN are oars
tations denote inverted kaiaks upon racks for drying. The human fig-
ures, one of whom is shown seated, represent natives supplicating a
Shaman for aid. The figure has both arms extended, as in making the
gesture for supplication, while the shaman, standing at the left, has his
arms and hands uplifted, as in the gesture illustrated in several figures,
relating to shamanistic ceremonials, termed by the natives as “ agitating

the air” in order to call to him his tutelary guardian, who is to aid the
shaman in success, in order to comply with the request made of him.

Within the dome-shaped habitation nearest the shaman is an accom-
paniment of tambourine drumming, while two assistants are also
engaged in invocation.

To the right of the supplicant is a repetition of his own form, indi-
cating his harpooning a seal or other animal, while still further toward
the end of the rod is an unfinished figure of a man in a kaiak—probably
the supplicant in another exploit made possible through the shaman’s
assistance.

Turning the bow around so as to bring the convexity beneath, there
appears at the left a linear outline of some undetermined animal, near
to which is an umiak containing three men. They are approaching a
settlement indicated by two forms of habitations, a dome-shaped or
permanent one and a triangular or temporary shelter, the two denot-
ing both kinds constituting the village.

Two racks are visible, a single one from which are suspended numer-
ous stands of meat or fish, and a double one, similarly filled with food.
The rude outline of a native at the right is nearest to a boat lying upon
its side, beyond which are the outlines of four waterfowl.

Some whales are next portrayed. The one with the flukes above the
water, and the spray thrown or forced from the spout holes, appears to
have thrown from the water the vessel containing four natives. Their
vessel is curved, making a slight arch, and the exposed end seems
broken open.

The whale beyond this is harpooned by a native in a kaiak; the
inflated float is still upon the kaiak behind him, indicating that not
much line has run out, as the whale, also, is headed toward the hunter.

The whale to the right of the preceding character has the tail up in
the air, while some water is indicated as issuing from the spout hole.
In front of this is an umiak with four hunters making for a herd of wal-
ruses on and about a ledge of rocks.

The rocks are indicated by the short markings between the two par-
allel lines denoting them, the markings consisting of the pattern
frequently mentioned herein as fish trap, and of which numerous illus-
trations are given, as on plate 31, fig. 2, and plate 36, fig. 2, and on the
accompanying plate 59, fig. 3. This indication of rock is of interest in
its differentiation from ice, as a solid mass, the latter being drawn only to
show its outline as a floe, the interior part of the space being left blank
to denote its colorless or transparent condition. On the same plate,
plate 59, in fig. 2, is shown a floe upon which seals are taking refuge.

The speaker, or rather he of whom the record treats, in plate 60, fig.
8, is represented at No.1. His right hand is elevated as when used in
gesticulating, while his left points down toward the foot of the scaffold
upon which is a repository for food. The two scaffolds at No. 2 no

854 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

doubt belong to him, and form part of the village indicated by the
several habitations and storehouses.

No. 3 isa dome-shaped winter habitation, about which two people are
occupied. No. 4 is another granary or food repository, while No. 5
represents a second house upon which two people are talking very
animatedly. The one at the right seems to be requesting, or suppli-
cating, both hands being directed upward toward the one spoken to.

No. 6 is the storage place for food and other articles, while in No. 7
we find another dome-shaped winter house with the inmates in view.
A third person is standing before the door, while under the accompany-
ing scaffold a fourth individual is visible.

No. 9 represents a winter house, and smoke is rising from the place
where the smoke hole is usually found. The smoke looks straight and
rigid, resembling a tree. The two people seem to be occupied in carry-
ing something. The illustration at No. 10 1s a scaffold for the safe loca-
tion of food, and Nos. 11, 13, and 14 are similar structures, whereas No.
12 is a warehouse, probably of a white trader. No. 15is a winter house,
though apparently deserted.

The specimen represented in plate 61 is a pipe bearing delicate and
elaborate etchings of a variety of subjects. The object is made of wal-
rus ivory, measuring 157 inches in length, 12 inches in height near the
insertion of the bowl, and slightly less than 1 inch in transverse diame-
ter at the same point. The perforation at the mouthpiece is one-eighth
of an inch in diameter.

The bow] is of block tin, while the top of the bow] is lined with a thin
sheet of perforated, ornamented brass. The caliber of the bowl is only
one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and seems to have been made in
imitation of a Chinese pipe bowl and. possibly for the same style of
smoking.

The pipes, like others of like form from the same locality, at St.
Michael’s[?], have been said to have been made for sale to traders.
That may be, and does not in the least impair the interest and value
of the pictographic records portrayed upon the several sides. Though
the pipes may be shaped, to a limited extent, in imitation of foreign
Shapes, yet the pictography remains Eskimo, made by an Eskimo, and
to portray Eskimo scenes and avocations.

The upper figure of the pipe presents the characters on the left side,
and beginning at the extreme left is observed a vertical ornamental
bar or border, similar to those drawn along the lower half of the pipe
stem, though in the latter space they are arranged diagonally, and
made to separate ornaments consisting of concentric rings, ornaments
to which special reference is made elsewhere. ;

The first group consists of two persons engaged in twisting a cord,
though the suggestion has been made that they appear to be engaged
in a pastime which consists in making string figures, similar to the
American boy’s “‘cat’s cradle,” ete. The figure next to the right repre-
sents the end view of a building having two rooms, in the larger of

which appear two persons seated playing on the tambourine drum,
while a third person is depicted in the graceful attitude of dancing
“ala Américaine.” The fourth figure is crouching or kneeling before
the hearth, probably to light a fire, as none appears to be there, as
indicated by the absence of smoke. The presence of fire is generally
indicated by the portrayal of short lines adhering to a vertical one, to
denote smoke. :

Upon the outside of the large room is a low structure containing the
second room. The face of the sun is painted upon the wall, in reference
to the return of the sun and warm weather—to spring; and the drops
of water, caused by the melting sun or ice upon the roof, are shown
dropping from a short wooden carved spout. The carving seems to
have been made in imitation of similar opes found among the T’hlinkit
and Haida Indians. The above dance and portrayal of the sun refers
to highly important and complicated ceremonials observed at the return
of the sun from the south.

The illustration reaching almost across the ivory space, that resem-
bling light lines in imitation of a ladder, is a fish weir, placed in
streams for catching salmon, and one of these fish is actually shown
appreaching the opening leading to the inclosure in which the game is
secured. An otter is also drawn approaching the fish trap, denoting
the destructive habits of the mammal in robbing the trap of fish thus
secured and unable to escape.

The rectangular figure immediately behind the otter appears to be a
view of the top of a boat landing, facing the water, and upon which
are two persons, one seated near a handled vessel—probably a bucket
or basket—while the other is drawn in the attitude of spearing fish,
the entire sketch seeming to have reference to another method of secur-
ing fish for food.

Immediately across the ivory space, and along the opposite base line,
are observable four persons, each drumming upon his medicine drum
and approaching a dome-shaped habitation, within which are portrayed
two persons, crawling forward on hands and knees to receive from a
seated figure some mysterious or magic substance. This is a shaman-
istic ceremony, in which some charmed medicines are secured, and by
means of which some special success is expected in the chase.

The character in the middle of the ivory rod, nearest to the dome-
shaped house, is a spout of water, at the narrow end of which is a trans-
verse line, with a shorter one within the inclosure. These two lines
denote the logs of wood employed by the beaver in building a dam.
The beaver is shown swimming toward a dark spot, which seems to
consist of a series of short scratches, and which denotes the deposit of
twigs for food, while the rounded dark disk upon the shore line repre-
sents the beaver’s house. The animal is accurately portrayed, the tail
being especially conspicuous to give specific indication as to the species
of animal intended to be shown.

In the next figure is represented one method of securing deer. The

856 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

inclosure, within which three deer are shown, is a pen made for securing
such game, the fourth animal to enter having been driven forward from
the open country and guided toward the entrance by the erection of
low brush fences, as will be observed, extending diagonally toward it
from the base lines at either margin of the ivory. The two hunters,
armed with bow and arrow, are seen running toward the inclosure to
shoot the deer.

Beyond the rear fence or inclosure of the deep pen are two pine trees.
Upon one is perched a bird, while half-way up the other is a small mam-
mal. The latter is not drawn in imitation of the porcupine—as else-
where portrayed—and it may be intended to represent the marten.
The next figure is a black bear, erect upon his hind feet and being
attacked by a hunter armed with a spear.

The next scene is a snare trap, which has caught and suspended in
the air a small animal. The trap is surrounded by vertical sticks so
arranged about the baited part that, to cause it to be sprung, the ani-
mal can reach the bait only at one open space. The noose is arranged
so as to catch the animal about the neck, in imitation of the American
boy’s rabbit snare.

The next trap shown consists of a log, or sapling, resting upon a
short upright piece, so that when the bait is touched the log will fall
and secure, by crushing, the animal so unfortunate as to enter. The
top is weighted by extra pieces of timber and sometimes stones, secured
so as not to fall off. A small animal is seen approaching the trap from
one side, while from the other is seen approaching a bear; the idea
being that this arrangement or kind of trap is employed in securing:
both kinds of animals. The small deer and men shown along the oppo-
site base line represent two hunters disguised in wolf skins so as to
more readily approach within shooting distance of the reindeer, while
the third has gone forward and shot an arrow, which is seen in its flight
approaching an animal. |

The last figure of the group is a fallen reindeer upon which one bird
of prey has alighted and another is seen descending. The feathers in
the outstretched wings are clearly indicated and the attitude is very
lifelike.

The upper ridge of the right side of the pipestem also bears some
interesting scenes. That on the section nearest the bow] contains two
human figures, one representing a native in the attitude of kicking a
ball, his leg being still in the air, while the other person is portrayed
as reaching out his hands as if to catch the ball as it descends. The
illustration next toward the left represents a habitation with two rooms,
in the larger of which is a horizontal line, midway between the floor
and ceiling, denoting the shelf used as seats and for sleeping. Upon
this shelf are seven persons, five of whom are represented as drum-
ming, using the ordinary tambourine for the purpose.

Beneath are five characters, four being shamans, while the fifth, a

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 857

smaller one, Shown as horizontal in the air, is the demon which has been
expelled from a sick man. The smaller apartment shows one person
with a dish, or pan, probably preparing food for the participants in the
ceremonials conducted within the adjoining room.

Outside of the house is a man portrayed in the act of splitting wood,
the log beneath his feet having two wedges projecting which are being
driven in to split the timber. A second individual is pushing at his
dog sledge, he having returned with a load, as may be observed, the
logs still in position at the front of the sledge.

The figure next to the preceding is seated upon the ground and
apparently mending his net. The characters above the wood chopper
and the returning traveler are drawn upon the opposing base line.
The figure in the attitude of running is going to the assistance of one
who has caught a seal, the latter resisting capture by the use of his
flippers, which are drawn extended from the body to denote their use
in the present instance. The ring indicates a hole in the ice, while the
bar held in the hands is the piece of wood to which the line is secured.

The illustration of fishing through the ice is shown in several records,
but in none more graphically than in the figure nearest to the seal
hunter above referred to. The native is here shown seated, and before
him is a fish lying attached to a short line by which it is secured, while
with the other hand the fisherman is holding his rod, the line passing
through a hole, and beneath are shown the sinker and hook, while a
fish is seen approaching to take hold. The representation of the trans-
parency of the ice was no doubt beyond the ability of the artist, and he
therefore very wisely made no attempt at any indication of a surface
line.

By turning over the pipestem the record may be renewed at the fig-
ure of the umiak, containing five hunters, four of whom are using the
paddles, whilst the fifth is throwing a harpoon toward a large walrus.
This creature has already been harpooned by a hunter in a kaiak, who
is holding up one hand with his fingers spread, while in the other hand
he holds his paddle. Upon the stern of the kaiak is the float, used in
connection with the harpoon line. A second walrus is observed imme-
diately behind the harpooned animal.

At the extreme left of the stem is a crouching or kneeling hunter
preparing to throw a harpoon at a seal or female walrus, from whose
mouth drops of water or perhaps blood are seen to trickle.

Upon the opposing base line of the pipestem is a single whale hunter
in his boat, a small whale having been harpooned, while to the line a
large skin float is attached to impede the animal’s motion. The other
whale is escaping, and the water is shown spouting from the nostrils
of both animals.

The ornamentation upon the two lower sides, as well as the tree-like
figures near the mouthpiece, will be discussed in connection with the
evolution of ornamentation.
858 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The specimen represented in the upper figure in plate 62 measures
12 inches in length along the central line and 13 inches in height at
the back of the bowl. The latter measures 24 inches across the top
and is 14 inches in height. The pipestem is made of a fine compact
piece of walrus ivory, which retains some of its lateral curvature as
well as that visible from the front view. The bowl is symmetrical and
was undoubtedly turned on a lathe.

The characters portrayed along the middle base line, beginning
nearest the mouthpiece, represent, first, a seal, then two water fowl. A
walrus then appears above the surface and is looking after the umiak,
which has passed in pursuit of a whale, and which creature has been
attacked by one of the hunters. The second hunter is holding aloft
his oar, a signal to indicate to others near by that assistance is wanted.
The other men in the umiak are using the paddle so as to keep pace
with the whale, which is shown spouting.

The elevated scaffold which is next portrayed was a notched piece
of timber set in place to serve as a ladder, and one person is shown
ascending, a bundle being attached to his back—probably food—as the
other person on the scaffold is occupied in preparing food of some kind,
which is then suspended from the horizontal poles, as shown in the
etching. The next illustration, to the right, represents a fisherman
hauling up his net to dry, while another man is occupied in splitting
wood, the wedges used for the purpose being shown in the log at the
end resting upon another piece of wood or a stone.

The house, which comes next in order, has two rooms, upon the roof
of the smaller one being shown an individual carrying into the house
some pieces of wood, which have been split by the wood chopper. The
horizontal line at the top of the large room has suspended from it small
round objects which denote some kind of food; and at tle middle line,
the shelf, used as a bed or for seat, shows three persons; the first one,
with one leg hanging down, is pointing, or reaching, toward a dish
containing food, as the second has already placed some into his mouth.
The third person is lying down, with legs curved and his head resting
upon a pillow or bale of some material found convenient for the pur-
pose. The person seated upon the floor does not seem specially occu-
pied, and directly behind is a vertical line, upon which is a lamp, the
usual method of constructing these being that of placing two soapstone
lamps upon a crosspiece, so as to balance, the center of the latter being
secured to a vertical stick.

The last illustration denotes a dome-shaped structure with a smoke
hole in the roof, one person being apparently busied with his pipe,
while the other has before him a kettle, in which he is stirring with a
stick or ladie. Between the two persons is the fire, from which the
smoke is seen to.rise and to escape through the opening at the top.

Within the small room of the house above mentioned is a short
vertical line, to which are attached some small globular figures. The

line represents the spout and is on the outside of the house, while the
globules denote drops of water—similar to those portrayed on the pipe
with the metal bowl, plate 61—and refers to the melting of the snow
upon the roof, as the approach of spring is referred to especially. On
the opposite side of the specimen, the first character is a man, with a
bundle on his back, running in the direction of an inclosure and deer
drive. Two reindeer are already in the pen, while three animals are
running toward it, closely pursued by the drivers, one of which is
armed with bow and undoubtedly also arrows.

The third person, walking along the upper base line, is in attendance
at a fish trap, into which four fish are seen toswim. Beyond this is a tall
pine, upon the summit being a bird, and half-way up, a small mammal.

The scaffold beyond this has upon the roof a man engaged in hang-
ing up deer, which have been captured and brought home by the two
men at the dog sledge, upon which is another deer. Immediately above
these figures is a man leading a dog hitched to a sled and thus dragging
home two seals—the latter represented upon their backs, just as these
animals are gotten along easily on account of the abundance of hair. A
large bear is Shown upon his haunches, one native attacking him with a
spear, while the second person has started to run away after shooting
an arrow into the bear’s back. The remaining two figures denote two
kinds of traps used in catching small animals, one being caught by a
noose, while the second is a deadfall.

Upon the upper base line, beginning nearest to the tall pine tree
already described, one man is shown attempting to take a somersault,
possibly as a pictorial portrayal of the sense of joy at the return of
summer; the second person has a rod which he is dragging home.
The two dogs are very cleverly portrayed, while the man next. to the
left is spearing an otter. The animal upon the ground seems to be
intended for a marten.

A clever sketch is presented in the next illustration, in which a native,
with a pack on his back and a small bucket in his hand, is gathering
berries.

The record ends with a deer, which has been secured by means of
suspending a strong noose over a path or trail frequented by the
animal. The hunter has come up to kill the captive with a spear.

The decorative designs are treated of elsewhere.

The specimen shown in plate 63 measures 102 inches in length, 14
inches in height at the highest part near the bowl space, and seven-
eighths of an inch in diameter.

This differs from the other pipes in the manner of placing the engray-
ings, these occupying the lower spaces, while the upper bear the con-
centric rings and diagonal lines. The left-hand figure in the upper
illustration in the plate denotes a habitation with its entrance. Seated
upon the projecting shelf seat is the drummer, holding the tambourine
drum in one hand while with the other he grasps a drumstick. The

860 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

other figures are the dancers, in various attitudes, with hands and
fingers extended. Upon the roof of the entrance are two men in simi-
lar attitudes, while within the entrance is one figure of a man in the
attitude of falling forward upon the ground. The dance does not appear
to be.a Shamanistie ceremony, as otherwise the indication of a demon
would be observed.

In front of the entrance is a group of figures in a threatening atti-
tude, especially one of the men, who appears to be drawing his bow with
the intention of shooting his vis-a-vis, who has a hand up as if guard-
ing his face. There appears to have been a discussion respecting a
seal—lying upon the ground between the men—which resulted as
suggested.

The next figure is shown in the attitude of spearing a seal in the
water, the spear bladder being shown at the upper end of the weapon.
The next man is dragging home a seal, while the next following is
engaged with a like animal, stooping down at the tail and for some
purpose not indicated.

The large creature lying upon the base line, next to the right, is a
whale. One of the hunters has a hatchet and is eutting up the ani-
mal, while the two assistants are otherwise engaged at either end.
Next toward the right, is another hunter in the act of dragging along
upon a sledge his kaiak. The last person to follow has upon his sledge
a Seal which has been captured.

Apart from the ornamentation in the upper ridge, there are two seals
visible at the left.

Upon the reverse side of the pipestem shown in the lower figure in
plate 61, the regular ornamentation occurs likewise along the upper
face, only two compartments at the extreme right being reserved for
the figures of seals.

Beginning at the right-hand end, and with the lower plane, a habi-
tation, similar to the one upon the opposite side, is portrayed, the only
difference being that there are two human figures drawn within the
entrance to the home instead of one.

Another figure of a man is upon the outside, seemingly leaning
against the door, while behind him are two men in mortal combat, one
preparing to thrust his spear, while the other has a drawn bow with
arrow directed forward toward his victim. Some plants are shown
upon the ground, which may have been the cause of the quarre: which
seems to be indicated.

Doctor A. Warburg, of Florence, Italy, kindly sent me sketches
taken from a pipe similar to the preceding, which he founda in the col-
lection of the American Museum of Natural History in New York
City. An interesting pipe from St. Michaels is in the collection of the
Georgetown College, Washington, District of Columbia. The story
told by the etchings rs the same as in plate 62, and it appears as if a
certain person, or persons, were the author of all of these examples, the
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. S61

characteristics of the etchings being the same, as well as the general
import of the narrative. In the Georgetown College specimen, how-
ever, the base line above or against which are shown the figures in
various pursuits and avocations extends from the front or bowl end
spirally around the stem back to the mouthpiece. This is unique so far
as known, and appears to be simply a fancy on the part of the maker
to cause quicker sale of the specimen, nearly all of this class of ivory
workmanship being made for sale to visitors.

Plate 24, fig. 2, is a triangularly-shaped drill bow from Sledge
Island. Itis 1345 inches in length. The three sides are very fully deco-
rated, the back of the bow bearing the greatest amount of work.
The three square figures at the left represent scaffolds, upon which
storehouses are located. Between these are two elongated figures rep-
resenting winter habitations. Upon the house at the left are four
human figures in various attitudes of gesticulation. Thethin vertical
line at the right of the entrance, having a small transverse scratch at
the top, denotes a votive offering, indicating that one of the occupants
of the house was lately deceased. Five men are seen under and about
the second storehouse. Upon the next or second habitation from the
left are four human beings, the larger being on all fours, as if in the
attitude of watching those just mentioned. The next figure is oceu-
pied with some small object at a fire, the smoke of which is seen rising.

Of the two succeeding figures, one is apparently holding a line, while
the other appears to be occupied in some gymnastic performance.
Beyond the next storehouse is another habitation. Beside the two
human figures will be observed smoke issuing from the fire, and a rack
upon which are suspended some objects, possibly meat, or some other
materials. The fourth habitation from the left, somewhat larger and
more rudely drawn than the preceding, also has upon the roof five
individuals, with arms and legs in various attitudes. The two vertical
lines with a horizontal pole between them represent a meat rack, and
the other lines indicate meat or fish. The six human figures immedi-
ately to the right of this meat rack are placed so that the heads point
toward the center of the record, while the feet of three rest on the bot-
tom base line, and the feet of the other three on the top base line.
This is intended to represent the idea of a circle, as the individuals are
engaged in a ceremonial dance. One of them, evidently the shaman,
is shown with three lines projecting from the head, possibly indicating
amask. From this point to the right end of the drill bow the record
occupies both top and bottom lines of the illustration. Upon the
dwelling to the right of the dancers are four human figures, one with
a Spear directed toward a deer, while the individual on the top of the
roof is pointing with one hand toward the animals, and his companion
has both arms raised in exclamation. The square elevated structure,
adjoining the house, represents a storehouse. At the top of the rod,
above these human figures, is a man dragging home a seal which he
862 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

has captured, while in front of him stands a reindeer which is being
shot at by a native who is armed with bow and arrow. A little farther
to the left, upon the same line, a man is lying flat upon the ground
with his gun directed toward the deer. Between the two elevated
storehouses are eighteen natives in various attitudes, participating in
a danee. At the right is a winter habitation, upon which an Indian
stands with one hand elevated, the object in his hand evidently denot-
ing a tambourine drum, A votive offering is shown over the entrance
to the habitation, while to the right is seen rising a column of smoke.
Upon the seaffold beneath the square part of the structure represent-
ing the storehouse is an inverted boat suspended for drying. A partly
obliterated figure of a human being occupies the space between the
storehouse and the end of the rod. The under sides of the bow are
filled with figures of habitations, racks from which are suspended
pieces of meat, and individuals occupied with various domestic duties.
One portion of another part of the record represents an umiak going
away from land toward some small objects which are believed to repre-
sent seal, while on the shore are represented four men dragging at a
large animal, possibly intended to represent a seal, and in front of them
a dog is hitched to another seal, dragging it home to the camp, possibly
to the left.

Plate 64, fig. 3, also represents an ivory drill bow from Diomede
Islands. The ornamentation shown at the left end of the illustration
is an attempt at duplicating the peculiar zigzag markings, the simple
form of which is shown in plate 51, fig. 4. The next oblong figure on
four piles represents a granary or food storehouse. Next is shown a
human being with his arms extended in the act of making some ges-
ture. To the right of this is a building resembling a white man’s
habitation or trader’s store. The mammal to the right of this repre-
sents a bear. Next come the figures of two walruses, and beyond the
middle to the right is the outline of a large bear in the attitude of eat-
ing some mammal which he has captured at the seashore, apparently
a Seal or large fish. To the right of this is a very crude figure, some-
what resembling a whale, with the tail elevated and the head down,
though from the ‘‘blowholes” there appears to be some spray ascend-
ing.. The latter seems to be represented by dots instead of the usual
short lines. To the right of this, upon the base line, is a long-necked
animal denoting a seal, and beyond, at the extreme right, is a granary
or storehouse elevated upon piles. Turning the specimen so that the
upper line becomes the base line there will be observed at the left, to
the right of the granary just mentioned, a figure of a seal, next two fair
outlines of trees, and a walrus. The pointed figure, almost triangular
in shape, appears to denote a summer habitation. The character in the
middle of the record, apparently a scaffolding, is not clearly determin-
able, as it seems to indicate from one point of view a granary upon a
scaffold, but the projection at the left with two short vertical lines

‘ GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 863

depending therefrom suggests an attempt at denoting some form of
animal, which seems obscured by the square structure attached to the
opposite line. A little farther to the left is the figure of a man with
arms outstretched, and beyond this the body of a walrus with huge
tusks. On the opposite side of the record, at the extreme right, is
portrayed a rock projecting from the sea, upon which
are resting four seals. A short distance beyond these Rt
is seen an umiak, and toward the left a whale, from :
above the head of which is indicated by simple little
triangular dots an explosion of spray, as is shown in
the figure upon the opposite side of the drill bow. This is of peculiar
interest, and indicates either inexperience in portraiture on the part of
the native artist or a high degree in conventionalizing. The remaining
figures can be readily determined and need no further interpretation.
Upon the narrow convex edge of the bow in the center of the entire
record is the outline of another whale with the
2 triangular dots for spray being arranged a little
be yy, ® nearer together so as to approach more nearly the
TET “al usual method of indicating spray or water thrown
Bec from the blowholes. To the right of this is a wal-
CUBTING UE A warxvs: rus and five seals, while to the left is a seal with
its young on its back, and other characters readily determinable by the
reader without further explanation. The bottom of the bow bears a
continuous series for more than half of its entire length of conventional-
ized seal heads, indicating ornamentation rather than an attempt at a
historical record.

Fig. 70 represents a native picking berries. This illustration is of
peculiar interest, as the nucleated circles upon the short leaved stems
denote the fruit. The same figure with the blossom, in which the three
short radiating lines are added to denote the flower, is shown on plate
46 in the powder measure. Upon this too are the short lines running
downward from the ring on the measure, to which are attached three
berries, i. e., three nucleated circles.

The engraving represented in fig. 71 is selected from a series of charac-

ters on anivory drill, locality unknown. The horizontal body represents
a walrus, lying on its back, being cut up by the two men, the one at the
left hand using a cleaver, while his companion is otherwise engaged at
the head of the animal. The artistic execution, apparent, is extraordi-
narily good; the lines being deep single creases, indicating the engraver
to have been thoroughly experienced in the use of the graver.
864 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Two illustrations of natives cutting up reindeer are shown in figs. 72
and 73. Both are very cleverly drawn, the limbs of reindeer bene
very naturally indicated, as assumed in dead animals.

A very clever sketch of a native fishing through a hole in

the ice is shown in fig. 74. The hole is indicated by a small

aes 4 circle while the ice itself is not shown—that being trans-

parent. One fish has already been caught, as shown above.

t «a The absence of lines to denote ice is similarly evident in the
Fig.74. Kolguev illustration on plate 10.

SIS A seal caught through the ice is shown in fig. 75, the hole

“being shown back of the hunter by the single form of a loop,

as in the illustration referring to seal spearing, fig. 76, where the hole

is again indicated by a circle on the ice line.

This scene is taken from the Chuckche chart,
though the drawing is evidently of Eskimo type.
The small loop above the nose of the seal is
simply an indication that there is a hole in the
ice, made by the seal for breathing. 4

the figure of animalis absent—beneath the surface.

The artistic execution of the several objects portrayed in fig. 78 is
rather crude. The two summer habitations or tents at the
left have’ between them a long pole from which are sus.
pended cords for the reception of fish for curing. The
person engaged in hanging up this article of food is drawn
in a crouched or seated manner, not because he or she

yas so seated, but because the figure was made too large
for the space within which to represent it in an upright
position. Figures in a seated pos-

ture are always placed in contact with the sur-

face upon which they are presumed to be so

located, either upon the ground, in a canoe, or

on a projecting shelf inside of the dwelling.

white traders, one of them having a door

eral subjects. In the upper half, at the right, is a summer shelter,
within which are two figures. One is seated upon the floor, while the

other has his hands extended and elevated, as if calling attention to
something of importance, or making the gesture for surprise. The tall
tree-like object next to the habitation is a column of smoke arising
from a heap of burning wood, visible upon the ground, while to the left,
against the fire, is a kettle, in which some one is stirring with a stick.
That the person is tired appears to be indicated by his resting his hand
upon his knee as he leans forward toward his work. The rack, bearing
a long horizontal pole, is next toward the left, and beneath it is a man
hanging up fish, which has been prepared by the one at the fire. The
individual has a piece of meat raised toward the bar, while before him
is a vessel from which it was removed. The long net stretched from
the left-hand scaffold pole to the end of the record is a gill net, a form
used to set in shallow water and generally stretched at right angles to
the shore line, in which manner more fish are intercepted than if it
were parallel therewith.

The small projections above and below the net are floats and sinkers.

Plate 65, fig. 2, shows a powderhorn made of antler. It was obtained
at St. Michaels. The specimen is decorated by incisions cut length-
wise, to both sides of
which are attached
various figures of ani-
mals, birds, and
human habitations.
The principal figure
shown in the illustra-
tion represents three
summer habitations,
while one of the natives is occupied in suspending meat from a drying
pole. At the left of this is a habitation beneath which is shown another
habitation, inverted, in which are portrayed four human beings. To the
left is a fox, or wolf, holding in its paws some small creature, evidently
game which it has captured. The animal seems to be pursued by a bird
of prey shown to the left, both having probably been hunting the same
quarry.

Plate 65, fig. 3, represents a so-called ivory box for snuff, though the
Specimen appears to be made of horn. This was obtained at Hotham
Inlet. The specimen is divided into four different compartments by
means of transverse lines, each line consisting of parallel incisions
decorated as in plate 28, figs. 2 and 4. The spaces contain representa-
tions of fish, sledges, tree ornamentations, and various other charac-
ters, notably the outlines of a number of human beings, apparently
dancers with rattles.

Plate 14, fig. 2, represents a bone or reindeer-horn specimen from St.
Michaels. Upon the lower side, at the left, is represented a boat with
four white men carrying out supplies from a trader’s store, within
which and behind the counter stands another man with a hat upon his

head. To the right of this is shown another hut, about which four
persons are occupied in preparing food. One is standing over a kettle
with a utensil in his hand, as if stirring, while another, to the right of
the smoke, is in the act of reaching into the vessel over which he is
occupied. At the extreme right is a meat rack. By turning the speci-
men upside down there will be observed approaching from the left a
native pushing a sledge, to which are attached two dogs. In front is a
native with hands lowered and extended, as if calling to urge forward
the dogs. At the right is a seaffold which is in connection with an
underground habitation. From the top of one of the smoke holes is
seen rising a heavy cloud of smoke. Two natives are also portrayed,
the one at the right with arms extended, as if making signals. To the
left is an upright pole over the entrance of the habitation, which
represents a votive offering.

Plate 66, fig. 3 represents a kantag or bucket handle from Norton
Sound. It is an old time-stained piece, and bears upon the lateral
edges a few sharply incised figures, that upon the right or upper side
denoting a procession of loaded sledges. The attitudes of the dogs
following them, as well as of the men assisting, are very natural. Upon
the opposite side of the middle are three kaiaks, on either side of which
are a number of seals, while at the extreme left are two low mounds
representing winter habitations.

In plate 67, fig. 5, Nos. 2,3, and 4 indicate the summer habitations
of some natives who had gone away to catch and cure salmon. The
fish are drying upon the racks shown in Nos. 1 and 5; at the latter one
the natives are hanging up fish, while at the other end of the rack is
the ever present dog.

No. 6 denotes the boat with three men inside, while the fourth is
towing the vessel toward shore.

The individual at No. 7 is making the gesture for calling attention to
something which he has at his feet—probably a salmon. No. 8 is a
native taking a skin of one of the dead animals, while Nos. 9 and 10
are also going to join in carrying venison, as shown by Nos. 11 and 12.
The dog between the two last named seems to scent the meat. No. 13
is engaged in cutting up an animal, the cut in the abdomen being shown
by two parallel horizontal lines. Nos. 14 and 15 are dead deer, over
which the native at the last named is busied. No. 16 is lying flat on
his stomach, holding a gun, as beyond the hillock, No. 17, he sees a
herd of deer, some grazing and some lying upon the ground. The rack
at 18 is where he had a camp at a former time, showing the locality to
have been visited before.

The entire village appears to have turned out, as shown in plate 67,
fig.3,to aid in dragging ashore a whale, No.1. Lines extend to either
side, where groups of men are dragging at them, No.2. The figures on
the animal are cutting off pieces, one at the left or head end having
raised a long slice of blubber or skin, while at the other end one of the

men is receiving a piece from another; while still another, nearer the
tail, is tossing a piece of the meat to a companion, whose arms are
stretched out to receive it.

Still another pair of natives are occupied with a large piece lying upon
the ground. At No.3 is a habitation, and at No. 4 the man is getting
ready his sledges to haul the meat back to the house, where the long
vertical ridge poles indicate that the meat is to be suspended from them.
The natives at Nos. 6 and 7 are also in the attitude of some occupation
in anticipation of having meat to hang up at the scaffold at No. 6.

The inverted quadruped near the middle of the record, and above the
rope, pertains to a record which was to rest upon the base line, on the
upper surface of the same side, but which was not undertaken.

The men at No. 5 are apparently using sledge runners upon which to
drag their umiak to the shore, so as to approach the whale from the
water side to assist in cutting him to pieces.

Plate 67, fig. 5, represents a number of different avocations connected
with the chase, and the artistic portrayal of the actions represented
are peculiarly distinct and interesting.

The left end of the record is somewhat marred by wear, but the first
character to be intelligible, No. 1, denotes the horns of a slaughtered
reindeer, of which the skin, No. 2, is outstretched upon the ground.
At No. 5 are represented the horns and forelegs of the animal, which
have been dressed for transportation to the village. At No. 4 is the
skin of a female reindeer, while at No. 5 is visible the hunter seated
upon the ground and smoking his pipe. His gun and quiver of arrows
are indicated at Nos. 6 and 7 respectively.

No. 8 denotes a bear which has been captured by the same hunter,
whose figure is reproduced, and his companion. No. 11 represents a
man engaged upon the section of a temporary shelter, while the indi-
vidual at No. 12 is using a drill bow to rotate the stick, held by No. 13,
in the act of making fire. Nos. 14 and 16 represent a boat’s crew who
landed at the camp or shelter just named. The first of the figures is
dragging the boat along shore, the one in the stern aiding in poling.
No. 15 is the figure of a fish to indicate the purpose for which the party
is away from their own home.

At No. 17 is shown a man hanging meat upon the rack for drying,
the strips of meat being visible the entire length of the horizontal pole
to 19, which is the skin of a reindeer. The duties of No. 18 are not
apparent, but he was evidently helping in the work of suspending
pieces of meat. No. 20 is a winter habitation, before which is one of
the inmates, No. 21, engaged in preparing food, or something that
requires stirring. Before him is observed rising a column of smoke,
No. 22, while at No. 22 is another kettle belonging to No. 23, who is
also, apparently, going to assist in the culinary work. No. 24 is a canoe
lying upon its side, so as to dry the bottom, and behind it is seen the
owner engaged in cleaning and repairing the side.
868 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The elongated figure at No. 25 is a fish net stretched out for drying.
Other characters appear to have been made farther toward the right,
but from use of the rod the surface has been worn so smooth as to
obliterate them.

ESKIMO ATHLETIC SPORTS,

The etchings reproduced in plate 67, fig. 4, were copied from anivory
rod in the collection of the Alaska Commercial Company, and were
interpreted by Vladimir Naomoff, a Kadiak half-caste referred to else-
where. The left-hand figure represents a long rack from which a native
has suspended reindeer hides, the person being portrayed at the right
as in the act of descending from a short ladder. The dome-shaped
figure is a habitation, before the door of which is
a square figure—perhaps a kettle—from which
smoke is arising. A native is next drawn in the
act of shooting areindeer, the arrows being shown
as if sticking in its back. The continuous body.
with eleven pairs of horns indicates that number
of animals. To the right are several reindeer down upon the ground,
two having been shot with arrows, the native being again shown in the
act of shooting toward a herd of ten reindeer, wounding one which after-
wards attacked him, and which he caught by the horns, as shown at the
extreme right end of the record.

The figure of the habitation No. 1, shown in accompanying illustra-
tion fig. 80, has above it at the left a character resembling a cedar tree,
but which denotes smoke. This resembles also the echar-
acter to denote spray or water as spouted by whales, illus-
trations of which are found elsewhere.

The individual seated over the entrance to the habita-
tion, No. 2, is watching the amusements going on a short Pig. 82.
distance before him. Nos. 3 and 4 have made use of the %ATV# MAKING
fishrack poles for horizontal bars, and while No. 3 is astride ae
of his and gesturing with his conversation with No. 2, No. 4 is making
a turn.

The person indicated in No. 5is preparing to run, the two remaining
figures in Nos. 6 and 7 acting, perhaps, as coachers.

Fig. 81, taken from the engravings on the ivory pipestem represented
in plate 61, shows a native in the act of standing upon his head
or taking a somersault. The representation is unique, and nothing
approaching this kind of athletic sport has been elsewhere found upon
the specimens in the collection.

The seated figure in fig. 82 is holding with one hand a piece of wood

from which he intends to make a bow; the other hand holding an adz
with which the greater part of the superfluous material is removed ere
beginning the final cuts and scrapings to produce the ultimate form on
surface.

The illustration of two men wrestling is reproduced in fig. 83 from
the pipestems shown in plate 62. The attitude of
the men is realistic, and shows the clinch in a “eateh-
as-catch-can” contest.

This, fig. 84, is also reproduced from the same pro-
lifie source, the pipestem, shown in plate 61. The
man at the right has kicked the ball into the air,
while his companion is ready to catch it, as is shown by the outstretched
hands.

Two men engaged in gambling are shown in fig. 85, That they are
sitting close together is indicated not only by their apparent proximity
but furthermore by the representation of the foot of one man extending

beyond the back of his vis-a-vis.
Whether the game is played with cards, with

sf Sticks, or some other materials, is not determi-
nable.

pects The illustration in fig. 86 is not of uncommon
OOM NL ASLEPL ENS ooourvence in records of dances, those so indi-
cated being the observers and not the participants in the ceremonials.
The pipe represented in the native drawing is the Siberian pattern, an
Eskimo reproduction of the general type being shown in plates 61 and
62, in which the bowl is a vertical stem with a broad, rather flaring top
with but a narrow and deep perforation, resembling
the Chinese pattern in respect to the small quantity of pwr
tobacco which the smoker can consume at one filling. =
The effect is attained, however, as Mr. Murdoch in- 2:
forms me “that the smoker will take a deep inhalation
of smoke—and vile smoke it is, generally—retaining it for a considera-
ble time until he is compelled to take breath, when another similar
inhalation of smoke is taken. This is repeated until the small charge

of tobacco is consumed. The result is a most violent fit of coughing,
becoming spasmodic and of such apparent-

ly painful character as to lead one to believe
that the poor victim is going to die at once.”

usually, of two to one of tobacco, rubbed together in the palm of the
hand and packed into the deep, narrow tube of the Catlinite pipe.

The outer or dry part of the lips only are placed against the pipe-
stem, and the moment a deep jong pull is taken the outer corners of the
mouth are slightly opened, without removing the lips from the tip, and
a deep breath taken in order that as the air enters the mouth some of

the smoke held therein passes

bronchial tubes, entirely filling
the lungs. The expiration is per-
formed by expelling the smoke
through the nostrils, at the conclusion of which another deep draw at
the stem followed by a like inhalation, this being continued with the
regularity of ordinary breathing, at each inspiration smoke passing
along with the air into the lungs.

Frequent coughing spells result and bronchial troubles are very
common among the males. The opportunities for close observation
were especially good during the writer’s detail as surgeon at a military
station at a time when the number of Indians upon the ration roll was
13,500, and personal experience was abundant also, both in the method
of making and the acquirement of a severe attack of bronchitis, though
of but limited duration.

The group represented in fig. 87 is actively engaged in a dance, the
various attitudes indicating considerable exertion. The seated figure
is holding aloft his shaman tambourine drum, the stroke across the
disk indicating the stick with which he produces the percussion.

DANCE AND FEAST.

The larger figure at the right is the chief officiating personage, and
is engaged in chanting. One hand is directed toward the drummer,
while the other is held aloft, in the act of supplicating aid from his
daimon or guardian spirit.

Fig. 83 is one of the very few illustrations of dances, and is perhaps
the only one that seems to be of a social character, in consequence of a
successful hunt.

No. 1 is a man making the gesture for here, at this place, having
reference to the village of which he is an inhabitant and of which the
houses are, in part, shown in Nos. 18, 20, 22, 24, and the storehouse,
No. 23. No. 2 is obliterated, and although it appears to resemble a
human figure, if is more probably a peak, similar to the ones shown in
Nos. 3 and 7. Nos. 4 and 5 are the hunters who, in the shelter of
the hill No. 7, are crawling up to within shooting distance of the deer,
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 871

resting upon the ground at No.8. No.6 denotes a bow and two arrows,
while another arrow, carried by the rear hunter, is shown above and
between the two figures.

The next portion of the record pertains to the feast given at the
dance, the latter being graphically portrayed in Nos. 9-17. The drum-
mers are indicated at either end of the group of dancers, the one at No.
9 being seated upon the ground. Nos. 10 and 11 are rather more
violent in their attitudes than Nos. 12 and 13. No. 12 is shown with
the right hand to the mouth to denote the gesture to eat, while with
his left he is pointing in the direction of the feast awaiting them.
No. 15 is indicating himself, and also points to the same place as No.
12, indicating that he too will be there. No. 14 is also shown as
making the gesture to eat, eating, or food, while with the other hand
thrown backward is pointing in the direction of the habitations. No.
15 seems to be acting in the manner of an usher, holding both hands
toward the place of the food, as if inviting the others to go.

No. 16 is shown with his hands up, a common attitude given to per-
sons portrayed as dancing or other excitement, such as surprise or
alarm in hunting, ete., while No. 17 has risen from his place and is using
the drum, similar to the one at No. 9. The summer habitations are
shown in Nos, 18, 20, and 22, the persons indicated between them being
members of the households near which they are represented.

No. 23 is a scaffold storehouse, while No. 24 denotes a winter or per-
manent habitation, with one of the inmates on the roof.

WHALING SHIPS AND BOATS, AND VISITING NATIVES.

In fig. 89 is portrayed an event which seems to have been of interest
to the recorder, or owner of the record. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are whaling
ships; from No. 2 is observed a feather-like figure rising from the deck,
between the main mast and mizzenmast, which denotes smoke rising
from the fire used for boiling blubber. At No. 5 the line is secured to
walrus, which is being hauled aboard.

Nos. 4 and 6 represent ships’ boats, while No. 5 is a native canoe, the
recorder being indicated at the stem of No. 5, in the act of making a
gesture with his left hand, and pointing with his right toward the diree-
tion of the ship No. 1, upon which are two men, the one upon the bow-
sprit of which is returning a gesture sign.

The man at the stern of the last-named ship is also making a hailing ~
sign to the canoe men at No. 4.

The two crosses at No. 7 are birds, while No. 8 is the walrus which
has been secured by the crew of ship No. 3.
872 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In fig. 90, Nos. 1, 2, and 3 represent whaling ships at anchor, the

ivory of the bow. The anchor chain is seen at No.3. Nos. 4 and 6 are
the ships’ boats in pursuit of whales, the specimen at No. 5 having been
harpooned, while in No. 6 the hunter is reaching down to grasp the
harpoon, the open hand being clearly indicated. No.8 isa killer whale,
while Nos. 9 and 10 denote seals diving into the sea.

PICTOGRAPHIC RECORDS.

This collection of records pertains more particularly to individual
exploits—hunting and fishing, traveling and combat. It is practically
impossible to classify all of the records or to relegate them to a spe-
cifie subject, as the sabjects are frequently not on one single theme,
but embrace a number of ideas upoh the same continuous face of
ivory; therefore the records are necessarily classified according to the
import of the majority of characters inscribed.

In the accompanying series presented below there appears to be
more allusion to individual performances than the record of an indefi-
nite number of people.

INDIVIDUAL EXPLOITS.

The carving shown in fig. 91, made of a piece of walrus ivory, was
copied from the original in the Alaska Commercial Company, San
Francisco, California, and the interpretations were verified by Vladimir
Naomoff, a Kadiak half-breed, to whom reference has already been
made.

No. 1 is a native whose left hand is resting against the house, while
the right is directed toward the ground. The character to his right
represents a “shaman stick” surmounted by the emblem of a bird—a
‘good spirit”—in memory of some departed member of the household.
It was suggested that the grave stick had been erected to the memory
of his wife.

No. 2 represents a reindeer.

No. 3 signifies that one man, the designer, shot and killed another
with an arrow. The elbow of the arm drawing the arrow is seen pro-

jecting behind the back, illustrating close observation on the part of
the artist.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 873

No. 4 denotes that the narrator has made trading expeditions with a
dog sledge.

‘No. 5 is a sailboat, although the elevated paddle signifies that that
was the manner in which the voyage was best made, The conspicuous
and abrupt stem specifies that it was a heavy boat, for use in sailing,
and not a baidarka.

No. 6 represents a dog sied, with the animal hitched up for a journey.
The radiating lines in the left-hand upper corner of the square contain-
ing the pictograph are the rays of the sun.

No. 7 is a sacred or ceremonial structure. The four figures at the
outer corners of the square represent the young men placed on guard,
armed with bows and arrows, to keep away those not members of the
band, who are depicted as holding a dance. The small square in the
center of the inclosure represents the fireplace. The angular lines

extending from the right side of the structure to the vertical partition
line show in outline the subterranean entrance to the structure or
lodge.

No. 8 is a pine tree, upon which a porcupine is crawling upward.

No. 9, a similar species of tree, from the bark of which a bird | wood-
pecker] is extracting larvee for food.

No. 9 is a bear.

No. 10 represents the owner of the record in his boat holding-aloft
his doublebladed paddle to call for help to drive fish into a net.

No. 11 is an assistant fisherman, one who has responded to the call,
and is observed driving fish by beating the water with a stick.

No. 12 represents the net which, as is customary also among many cf
the tribes of the Great Lakes, is usually set in moderately shallow
water.

No. 13, the figure over the preceding character, denotes a whale, with
line and harpoon attached, which was caught by the fisherman during
one of his fishing trips.

A man in a kneeling posture, about to throw a spear at an animal, is

THROWING HANPOON the native in drawing the bow. The arrow has already

been discharged and is on its message of death, but a short distance
from the head of the animal. Immediately in front of the hunter is a
mound upon which is a tree, behind which the hunter approached to
within shooting distance. The animal is
drawn facing the hunter to indicate the
fact that it was secured.

The flatness and absence of mark-
ings upon the mound indicate the differ-
ence between it and a winter habitation.

The bag handle shown on plate 58, fig. 2, presents three panels, on
which are portrayals of natural objects. The separating lines consist
of pairs of vertical zigzag markings, while the front panel bears the
figure of a hunter armed with a bow and
arrow in pursuit of reindeer, one of these
animals being indicated in each of the
two remaining panels.

The two individual characters repre-
sented in fig. 95 as Nos. 3 and 5 are
intended to denote the same person. The one, as No. 3, is the hunter
armed with bow and arrow, and by hiding himself behind the tree, No.
2, he was enabled to shoot the buck, No. 1, when the latter had kept
on grazing to within proper range. Being hidden from view of the doe,
No. 6, by the hill, No. 4, the hunter imitated the call of the male, thus
bringing within range the female. The figure in No. 5 represents, as
above stated, the hunter, but in this additional form in order to give

him the gesture of calling or beckoning with the left hand, in the direc-
tion indicated by the extended right arm and hand, the attitude of the
animal also showing that it followed. The hunter has projecting from
his mouth a short black line, denoting voice, produced by whistling or
a decoy whistle.

The sketch shown in fig. 96 is of interest on account of the indica-
tion shown by the artist that the reindeer is wounded and can not

escape being shot by the hunter. The animal is placed in an attitude
as if backing, the legs drawn so as to project slightly to the front to
denote its inability to progress in that direction.

The short line in the hand of the middle hunter is an arrow, which
is being held toward the one shooting. The figure at the left is quietly
observing thescene,
smoking his pipe.

A clever.and
cleanly cut illustra-
tion is reproduced
in fig. 97, represent
ing a hunter in his baidarka, paddling toward an ice pan upon which
is quietly reposing a walrus.

All the figures are heavily incised by vertical lines, the ice alone
remaining as a hollow outline to indicate its transparent or translucent
condition.

The illustration of the two sides of a piece of ivory, fig. 98, is from
Utkiawin, in the
Point Barrow re-
gion of Alaska, and
is described by Mr.
Murdoch! as being
a piece of an old snow-shovel edge with freshly incised figures on both
faces, which the artist said represented his own record. ‘The figures
are all colored with red ocher. On the obverse the figures all stand
on aroughly drawn ground line. At the left is a man pointing his
rifle at a bear, which stands on its hind legs facing him. Then comes
ashe-bear walk-
ing toward the
left, followed by
a cub, then two
large bears also
walking to the
left, and a she-
bearin the same
attitude, fol-
lowed by two
cubs,onebehind
the other. This was explained by the artist as follows: ‘These are all
the bears [have killed. This one alone (pointing to the “rampant” one)
was bad. All the others were good.’ We heard at the time of his giving
the death shot to the last bear as it was charging his comrade, who had
wounded it with his muzzle-loader. On the reverse the figures are in
the same position. The same man points his rifle at a string of three
wolves. His explanation was: ‘These are all the wolves I have killed.’”

876 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Plate 59, fig. 3, shows a drill bow from Norton Sound. The orna-
mentation upon one side consists of eleven wolves, while on the other
side is represented a herd of reindeer, the herd being divided into two
parts, between which is shown the figure of a wolf.

It may be that the above instance records the fact of the owner
being a successful hunter, and thus records a successful exploit,
though the uniformity in outline of the animals suggests a tendency
also toward ornamentation as
well as portraying an occur-
rence. :

The fungus-ash box shown on —
plate 56, fig. 5, shows along —
the upperline of illustrations a
hunter with throwing stick and
weapon running after some —
birds which he is desirous of
securing.

Upon the lower line the same
person, perhaps, is shown be-
hind a sledge riding his dog in
pulling the conveyance.

When the box is reversed,
there will be seen upon the upper
line a clump of trees at the
right, while to the left of these
is a hunter kneeling in the atti-
tude of shooting at a bear; be-
hind thelatteris another animal,
perhaps a mate.

Upon the lower line is a ship,
toward which two native boats
are directed. The face at the

attempt at caricature.

The hunting tablet found by Mr. Murdoch at Point Barrow, and
before referred to, is represented in plate 65, fig. 1. The description
given by him is in connection with the illustration given on plate 56,
fig. 1, referring to the reverse of the tablet.

The accompanying illustration, fig. 99, and description is from Mur-
doch’s report on the Point Barrow Eskimo,! and appears to be one of
the four specimens brought back by him. The tablet is of ivory, 4.8
inches long and 1 inch wide. On each face is an ornamental border
inclosing a number of incised figures, which probably represent actual
scenes, as the tablet is not new.

Mr. Murdoch says:

The figures on the obverse face are colored with red ocher. At the upper end,
standing on a cross line, with his head toward the end, is a rudely drawn man holding
his right hand up and his left down, with the fingers outspread. At his left stands
a boy with both hands down. These figures probably represent the hunter and his
son. Just below the cross line is a man raising a spear to strike an animal which is
perhaps meant for a reindeer without horns. Three deer, also without horns, stand
with their feet on one border with their heads toward the upper end, and on the
other border near the end are two bucks with large antlers heading the other way,
and behind them a man in a kaiak. Between him and the
animal which the first man is spearing is an object which
may represent the crescent moon. The story may perhaps be
freely translated as follows: ‘‘ When the moon was young,
the man and his son killed six reindeer, two of them bueks
with large antlers. One they speared on land, the rest they Lyf
chase | with the kaiak.” sf

On the reverse the figures and the border are colored black Hi)
with soot. In the left-hand lower row is a she bear and her \ 4
cub heading to the left, followed by a man who is about to
shoot an arrow at them. Then come two more bears heading
toward the right, and in the right-hand lower corner is a
whale with two floats attached to him by a harpoon line.
Above this is an umiak with four men in it approaching
another whale which has already received one harpoon with
its two floats. The harpoon which is to be thrust at him
may be seen sticking out over the bow of the boat. Then
come two whales in a line, one heading to the left and one to
the right. In the left-hand upper corner is a figure which
may represent a boat bottom up on the staging of four posts.
We did not learn the actual history of this tablet, which was
brought down for sale with a number of other things.

Mr. W. Boyd Dawkins figures an arrow straight-
ener of walrus ivory (fig. 100) which is almost an
exact reproduction in form of that shown in plate 8,
fig.1. The latter is from the Diomede Islands, and
bears the figure of a reindeer only. That shown by
Mr. Dawkins bears along one edge a row of reindeer,
while at the opposite margin of the same side a
series of seven figures, five of which resemble the
human form, each with antler and headdress, and
outstretched arms, from the sleeves of which are
suspended what appears to denote fringe—short
servations. ‘Two figures are placed in profile and in that position more
nearly resemble reindeer rampant, though the characters are evidently
intended to represent the same idea as that expressed in the five
preceding ones.!

Another illustration from the same work and author relates to a
hanting scene, two natives being represented as in pursuit of two
reindeer, one of which has been shot and is lying down.

ARROW STRAIGHTENER.

878 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Plate 22, fig. 1, represents an ivory drill bow from Kotzebue Sound.
The implement is 15 inches in length and seven-eighths of an inch in
width. Besides being undulating the specimen is polished down at
intervals of 2 inches in such a manner as to represent or produce slight
constrictions, as will be observed from the illustration. It represents a —
hunting record, the hunter or owner of the specimen being shown at the
left in the attitude of shooting at a bear, which animal is accompanied
by seven others of the same species. Some of these are separated by
vertical lines, thus forming partitions in the record. At the extreme
right is another illustration of whale hunting, and to intelligently un-
derstand the engraving the bow must be turned around. The hunter is
here represented in his kaiak, above which is an irregular circle con-
nected with the whale by a sharply defined line. This represents a
harpoon cord and the seal-skin float which is usually attached to impede
the progress of the captive. The whale is represented with great
accuracy. Above the outline of the kaiak will be seen a native draw-
ing a bow, the arrow being directed forward toward a flock of geese,
numbering seven, one preceding the other, in a very lifelike attitude.

Plate 68, fig. 2, shows an old and age-stained specimen of ivory, also
representing a drill bow, from Kotzebue Sound. The under surface is
the one represented in the illustration. At the extreme left are five
bear skins and a long-tailed animal which may denote the otter. To
the right of the vertical line—the line denoting the separation between
two records—are engraved the figures of three white men, or perhaps
only two, as the two are of the figures portrayed with the rimmed
hats. One of these is handing a small object to his companion, whose
hands appear to be stuck in his pockets. To the right of this individual
are six cone-like objects connected at the apex by a continuous line,
and between which are rude upright objects resembling columns of
smoke. These are summer habitations, with probably indications of
smoke from the camp fires. In the middle of the record are two cone-
like structures, denoting mountains, between which is a semicircle
deeply engraved with short lateral lines representing a conventional
tree symbol with branches at either end and upon the sides. The sig-
nification of this appears to be that between two mountain regions
occurs an abundance of timber. This method of portraying an abun-
dance of anything is very similar to a common practice adopted by many
of the Indian tribes of the United States, especially the Ojibwa and
some of the Shoshonian tribes.’ The four triangular figures to the right
represent huts, while a continuous line extends from the mountain
toward the right and connects with a man disguised in a wolf skin.
The signification of this is not clear. It may denote the act of a shaman
in such disguise approaching the habitations and extracting something
therefrom, or he may intend harm to one of the occupants; or it may

signify that in this disguise he was enabled to approach walruses and
shoot them. This method of disguise was practiced by some of the
prairie tribes of Indians west of the Mississippi River. Many shy ani-
mals may thus be approached to within shooting distance, while the
human form would at once alarm them and cause them to escape.
Three walruses are drawn upon the record, and as their heads are
placed in the direction of the human figure, it is believed that this is
intended to denote their capture by the hunter, this practice being
verycommon. On the contrary, had they not been secured, their heads
would have been placed in an opposite direction. At the extreme right
are six bear skins upon the ground, in an upright position, very much
resembling the conventionalized figures of skins shown in plate 22,
fig. 3.

On the opposite side or upper curve of the bow is a very rare char-
acter; in fact, the only instance observed in the entire collection in the
possession of the National Museum in which the pudendum is indicated.

This character was referred to in conversation with Mr. Murdoch,
who questioned the writer with reference to its occurrence in picto-
graphs from Point Barrow. At the time of the conversation the
engraving had not yet been observed. The creature immediately to
the right of this is a walrus which has been harpooned, as the projecting
weapon illustrates, and through it is the flying harpoon line connecting
it with the hunter in the bow of a fine large umiak occupied by seven
hunters. The next character is an umiak hurrying to the right in
pursuit of a whale, the harpoon having been thrown forward and
apparently into the animal. The next figure is that of a human being
with one hand to his head and the other to his groin, the sharply incised
line extending downward from the middle of the abdomen. The sig-
nification of this is not clear. Further toward the right are the out-
lines of two kaiaks, the shapes of which are very graceful, while only
one shows the presence of a hunter, the other being incomplete. The
record is concluded upon this side of the bow by the figures of two
walruses.

Upon one side are a number of walruses and other animals, while
near the left is the portrayal of a whale, to which the harpoon line and
float seems attached. Some short figures are introduced to fill up the
Space. On the remaining side we have at the extreme left a seine net,
to the right of which are several animals not identifiable with certainty,
as the engravings are very crude on this record. A number of wal-
ruses, a whale, and a man in a kaiak occupy the greater portion of the
remaining part of the record, while a single triangular habitation is
Shown, together with two crudely drawn figures of wolves.

Plate 24, fig. 1, shows a drill bow from Cape Darby, where it was
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson. It is of ivory, and measures 133 inches
in length. It is a hunting record, the story beginning at the right
hand, The hunter is shown with gun raised, directed toward a herd of

reindeer. Above fourteen of these animals will be observed black spots
denoting bullets, and indicating that that number of animals were shot
The remaining five have no such marks, which indicates that that num-
ber were with the herd, but were not secured. The peculiarity of this
unique record is the indication of the bullets, each denoting capture
of the game, whereas in most other records from the same region the
indication of the capture of game consists in the heads of the animals
being turned toward the hunter; those animals seen and not captured
being turned in an opposite direction.

By reversing the bow so as to bring to proper view the small figures
at the left-hand upper corner, the reader will perceive at the left an
elevated storehouse, to the right of which is a small mound represent-
ing a winter habitation, while next to the right of this is another struc-
ture of similar character. The main figure portrayed has a thin line
extending from himself to one of the reindeer of the preceding group,
indicating that another hunter captured it by means of a lasso or rope,

On the under side of the bow is a seal-hunting scene. At the left
are five kaiaks, four of the hunters being represented with the paddle

uplifted horizontally to indicate the presence of game and to call the
attention of other hunters to the animals. To the right of the fifth
boat is a fish. The next character represents a kaiak, the occupant of
which also holds his paddle horizontally above him, as he is approach-
ing two seals, and indicates to the occupants of the umiak to approach
and capture them. One of the hunters in the umiak is portrayed with
agun. The figure at the extreme right represents a fish.

On the edge of this drill bow is a series of figures apparently
intended to fill up the space. The twelve beginning at the left repre-
sent seals facing the right. Then come five larger animals facing the
left, all of these apparently half in water, their projecting heads and
bodies very much resembling some characters used for the portrayal of
water fowl. The next character, which is T-shaped, is a conventional-
jzed whale tail. The next character to the right is not sufficiently
clear to admit of certain identification, but the next four represent
deer. Beyond the vertical bar are sixteen rudely executed figures of
seals.

Francisco, California. The animals secured by the hunter are shown,
as well as those observed by him during the trip, but not secured.
Nos. 1 and 2 represent deer; No. 5 is the outline of a porcupine, next
to which is the habitation of the hunter, No. 4. Smoke is seen issuing
from the roof of the hut, while at the door is the hunter’s wife with a
vessel, No. 5. At No. 6 is the outline of the hunter himself in the atti-
tude of shooting an arrow, thus indicating the weapon used by him.
Nos. 7, 8, and 9 are beavers; Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are martens;
No. 15 is a vessel, according to the interpretation given by Naomoff,
although there are no specific characters to identify it different from

the preceding; No. 16 is a land otter; No. 17 represents a bear, while
No. 18 is a fox; No. 19 is a walrus, the tusks being perceptible at the
left side; No. 20 is a seal, while No. 21 represents a wolf.

As above remarked, the animals are all indicated; those with the
heads turned toward the hunter were secured, while those with the
head turned away from him were observed, but not secured.

The story told by the pictograph, together with the text in the
Kiateyamut dialect of the Innuit language, is as follows:

In the collection from Point Barrow is one example, of which an
illustration is here reproduced in fig. 102. It is a piece of the edge of
an old snow shovel, and measures 4.2 inches long, with a loop of thong
at the upper edge to admit of suspension. It is covered on both sides
with freshly incised figures, colored with red ocher, and is described
by Mr. Murdoch as follows:!

The obverse is bordered with a single narrow line. At the left is a man standing
with arms outstretched, supporting himself by two slender staffs as long as he is.

In the middle are three rude figures of tents, very high and slender. At the right
is a hornless reindeer heading to the left, with a man standing on its back with

his legs straddled apart and his arms uplifted. On the reverse there is no border,
but a single dog and a man who supports himself with a long staff are dragging an
empty rail sledge toward the left.

I find no mention of the use of any such scores among the eastern Eskimo. * * *

The engraving represented in fig. 103 is from a flat piece of the out-
side of a walrus tusk 9.7 inches long and 1.8 wide at the broader end.
The engravings are very crude, when compared with some of the work
from the west coast of Alaska. The specimen is one of the four pieces
brought back from Point Barrow by Mr. Murdoch, and the following is

‘his description.’

The figures are incised on one face only and colored with red ocher. The face is
divided lengthwise into two panels by a horizontal line. In the upper panel, at the
left, is a man facing to the right and pointing a gun at a line of three standing deer,
facing toward the left. Two are bucks and one a doe. Then come two bucks, rep-
resented without legs, as if swimming in the water, followed by a rude figure of a
man in a kaiak. Below the line at the left is an umiak with five men and then
a gow of twelve conventionalized whales’ tails, of which all but the first, second,
and fifth are joined to the horizontal line by a short straight line. The record may
be freely translated as follows: ‘“‘I went out with my gun and killed three large

'Ninth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1887-88, 1892, pp. 363, 364, fig. 363.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 883

reindeer, two bucks, and a doe. I also speared two large bucks in the water. My
whaling crew have taken ten whales.” The number of whales is open to suspicion,
as they just fill up the board.

In the above description the author does not state, as he has done in
another instance, that the interpretation was obtained from the native
owner, and it may therefore be assumed that he ventures the interpre-
tation himself. The statement at first that the animals were deer and
later on reindeer is confusing in the attempt to differentiate between
the objective portrayal by the natives of the two species of animals.
It is evident that the reindeer is intended; because of the unusually
long, narrow antlers and their forward direction in their position upon
the head. It is unfortunate that no other pictographs from Point Bar-
row are at hand, in order that satisfactory comparison with other rep-
resentations of deat and reindeer might be made so as to make note of the
specific differences, as we find so elaborately portrayed in the records
from Sledge Island, Norton Sound, and elsewhere.

The reference to a female animal is perhaps a random one, because
the natives of Alaska, as well as the aborigines of North America
generally, are too cautious and matter of fact to portray that which
they do not intend. The horns upon the third animal—the doe(?)—are
too strikingly like those upon the two preceding specimens to denote
anything different from them in sex.

The statement that ‘‘the number of whales is open to suspicion” is
worth noting, as frequently a large number of anything is denoted by
an indefinite number of conventional indications of such objects.
Various examples are given in which such large numbers have been
engraved with an ornamental or decorative motive, leading one to sus-
pect the true import intended by the recorder. A common example is
found in the ordinary ‘‘war bonnet” of eagle plumes, worn by several
of the so-called Prairie tribes of Indians. The single feather is gained
by a warrior when he either kills an enemy or is one of the first four to
reach and touch the fallen enemy with the coup stick, a bow, or any
other object. Theact of being able to reach the enemy in such manner
is deemed by the Indian to denote that he is nearer and more in danger
than the one who may have fired the fatal shot. After a number of
plumes have been thus gained by a warrior, each to indicate an exploit
of valor, the number becomes inconvenient for attachment to the scalp
lock and the long plumed bonnet is permitted, provided the one so
entitled thereto is able to purchase such a decoration, the present value
of eagle plumes varying from $1 to $2 each.

In similar manner an indefinite number of items, to denote many, is
often portrayed in pictorial records of various rudely remote peoples;
and it is probable that the above is only another instance, of which
others are noted in the present paper.

884 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

HUNTING AND FISHING.

The characters in plate 69, fig.3, at Nos. 1, 2, and 3, denote whales,
while at Nos. 4,5,6,and 7 are indicated four American whaling ships.
The one at No.7 is placed in a foreshortened position, something sel-
dom expected to be so reproduced by primitive peoples.

No. 8 appears to be an ice pan, at the base of which two men seem to
be in the water with hands uplifted to attract attention; while No. 9 is
a seal fisher hastening forward. The harpoon is seen resting upon the
rack upon the fore part of the canoe, as is also perceptible in No. 10.
The large bodies behind the occupants of the boat are floats used to
retard the swimming and escape of harpooned seals.

The manner of hunting sea otter is as follows: In Alaska the Aleuts or other
natives are the otter hunters. A large number of bidarkas take provisions for a
day or two, and when the weather is calm, put out, often out of sight of land. When
arrived on the banks most frequented by these animals, the bidarkas form a long
line, the leader in the middle. They paddle softly over the water so as to make no
disturbance. If any Aleut sees an otter’s nose, which is usually the only part above
the surface, he throws his dart and at the same time elevates his paddle perpendicu-
larly in the air. The ends of the line dart forward, so as to encircle the animal in a
cordon of bidarkas, and everyone is on the watch for the second appearance of the
otter. The same process is repeated until the animal, worn out with diving, lies
exhausted on the surface, an easy prize for his captors. The skin belongs to the
hunter who first struck it, or to him who struck nearest the head.!

Plate 69, fig.2. Capture of polar bear [?]. The signification of the
illustration is that a bear was observed eating a seal, when the natives
of the village at No. 9 went forward in the canoes, Nos. 5 and 6, when
one of the bravest made the attack with a spear. The seal is indicated
at No. 1.

The figure at No.4 is not explained; while at No.8 a canoe is still
resting upon the seaffold drying.

In plate 69, fig. 1, is a record of a whale and seal hunt. No.1 isa
seal which has been captured by the two hunters, Nos. 2 and 3, and is
being dragged to shore for return home. The hunter is carrying his
seal lance before him like a staff, while No.3 is carrying his at a charge.
Nos. 4, 5, and 6 are baidarkas with the oarsmen within, the foremost
individual in No. 6 having harpooned a whale, which is heading away,
spouting. The object between the boats, Nos. 5 and 6, is a seal diving
out of harm’s way. The hunter at No. 8 has caught a seal, No. 10, and
on the line is a small disk which denotes the float used. In some picto-
graphs the disk represents the opening in the ice, through which the
line is dropped, although this may be in the air and resemble a float.

No. 11 is indefinite, while Nos. 12 and 13 denote the summer or tem-
porary habitations, erected for a short sojourn only, until the meat
has been secured which is being placed upon the rack, No. 14, by the
person shown at the left end, in that employment.

The vertical strokes continuing beyond this to the end of the record
are simply ornamental, the space being deemed too small for further
records.

At Nos. 16 and 17 are two baidarkas to indicate that the seal was
captured while on a hunt by boat.

The accompanying illustration, in plate 69, fig. 4, represents a fleet
of canoes, the natives having gone on a hunt, although the leading
umiak only is shown to be engaged in harpooning a whale, No.7, which,
quite unusually, is portrayed with the tail projecting from the water.
The animal in front of it is q seal. The No. 9 character denotes a
seal diving out of the way. One of the men in No. 12 boat is making
a signal of surprise to the boatmen behind, as he has observed the
whale in sight and has thus given the alarm as well.

No. 1 seems to have been intended for a specific character, but may
have remained unfinished, merely touching up the right-hand end so as
to be ornamental. The two figures in Nos. 2 and 3 indicate wolves,
the number captured by the party in the baidarka, No. 4. No. 5 is a
whaler observed by the hunters.

RIVAL WHALE HUNTERS.

An illustration of rivalry in hunting the whale is given in fig. 104,
but the sequel does not appear. The two boats were pursuing the same
animal, which is shown spouting, and the harpoon throwers are in the
attitude of casting their weapons at the same instant.

The etching is strongly and artistically executed.

Plate 64, fig. 2, represents a very old ivory bow drill from the Dio-
mede Islands. The specimen is actually brown with age and bears
incisions upon four sides. The surface shown in the illustration bears
at the left a large umiak in which are four hunters, the one in the bow
being represented as throwing a harpoon toward an approaching
whale. Beyond this figure is a hunter in his kaiak who has thrown
his harpoon at a whale, the latter being represented with the head pro-
jecting vertically from the water. The short irregular character in the
stern of the kaiak represents the inflated seal-skin float. Two other
whales in this upright position are shown to the right of the above
mentioned, and they are approached from the right by two hunters in
a large umiak, the one in the bow being also represented as having
cast a harpoon, the line extending from his hands to the animal. At
the extreme right is a hunter in his kaiak. Upon the opposite side of
the specimen, beginning at the left, is a walrus being dragged forward
by four men. To the right of this group are shown four kaiaks each
with its hunters, and each hunter having his harpoon elevated horizon-
tally above his head as in the act of throwing. Behind the hunters
886 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

are represented the usual figures of the inflated seal skins used in
connection with the harpoon line. Three large figures of walruses
are next shown, upon the back of the first being portrayed a young
one. At the right of the upright walrus is an umiak containing four
hunters who are traveling toward the right in pursuit of a whale,
towards which the hunter in the bow of the umiak is casting his har-
poon. Upon the upper narrow edge of the’rod are a number of small
figures, at the extreme left six natives being shown, each with one arm
elevated, and a small line extending from the hand to the head, very
much suggesting the use of the pipe as in the act of smoking. ‘Three
seals are next drawn, beyond which are two kaiaks, and beyond these
the figures of six seals. The entire series of characters are arranged
with such apparent regularity as to suggest more of an attempt at
ornamental decoration than the portrayal of any experience in hunt-
ing. The narrow face opposite to this bears two horizontal parallel
lines within which are a number of narrow cross lines and two cireular
indentations, neither of which appear to have any special significance
further than an attempt at simple ornamentation.

Another illustration of whale and seal hunting is given in plate 70,
fig. 1. The four creatures indicated by No. 1 are seals, toward which
the native in the canoe is paddling, No.2. Above him is a small cross
denoting a bird in flight. The spouting whale, shown in No. 3, is har-
pooned by the man in the bow of the baidarka, No. 4, while the man
behind him is holding aloft his cateh—a large fish—while with his right
hand he is also calling attention by the gesture of surprise. The others
in the boat are paddling to keep up with the whale.

Nos. 5 and 6 appear to be seals, although the latter resembles more
nearly the smaller whales, as drawn in other pictographs, yet this can
scarcely be, as the hunter, No. 7, is lying upon the ground and resting
his gun upon a ridge or rock, in the attempt to shoot the animals,

The hunter at No. 8 is stealthily coming up to No. 7, carrying a gun
or lance.

No. 9 denotes three seals, while No. 10 is a hunter awaiting their
approach, he lying behind a small heap of what, by its remaining
untouched by the graver, would appear to be ice.

No. 11 is a boat being carried out of the water, a whale, No. 12, hav-
ing been killed and ready to be cut up. No. 13 is a baidarka containing
some returning whales, while No. 14 is a seal, the hunter taking it to
his habitation at No. 15, the interior view being disclosed, showing
within two of the hunter’s family, one seated upon the floor while the
other is addressing some words to him, or her, as denoted by the atti-
tude of the hands, Another permanent dwelling is indicated at No.
16, the smoke rising out of the smoke hole, while the owner is at the
side entering into conversation with the others because of the return
of the lucky hunter.

The accompanying fig. 105 is interesting because two different pur-
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 887

suits are represented, one being interrupted in order to prosecute
another. The natives had gone out in their baidarkas to fish, as indi-
cated by the middle figure of No. 2 group holding up two fish which
had been caught, and the man No. 4 also having a large salmon (?)
attached to a pole. A whale was observed spouting, No. 1, when the
boatmen started after him, the foremost one darting his harpoon into
the animal while the one on the stern began to make signals, calling to
his companions that there was game in sight. The signal is the com-
mon one of holding aloft, horizontally, an oar so that it may be seen by
those toward whom it is held and intended to be seen. The signal was
observed, as we perceive in No, 3 the three men pushing into the water
the baidarka, lying on its side, the middle man holding the harpeon
while the one at the right is pushing at the vessel. No. 4, as already
stated, has a fish attached to a pole; No.5 is making gestures, also
calling to others to come, while No. 6 is seen walking toward the shore
with a rod, probably intended for an oar.

The three small crosses in a horizontal line above No. 3 denote birds
flying in air.

obtained at St. Michaels. The engraving is characteristic of the locality,
being deep and boldly cut. Upon the upper surface shown in fig. 1
appears an umiak with four hunters, the one in the bow preparing to
throw his harpoon toward a whale. In front of the latter is another
umiak, the man in the bow of which is also throwing his harpoon to a
whale, while in frout of the latter is a projecting fluke, indicating an
animal of similar species descending into the water, while to the right
is an umiak, the occupant of which is endeavoring to throw his harpoon
into the whale just referred to. At the extreme right is another umiak
with four men, the one in the bow also harpooning a whale. The head
of the latter is drawn very much in initation of a tuskless walrus, and
might be mistaken for that animal, or a seal, but for the spray of water
which is represented as being thrown from the blow holes. ‘Turning
the handle around, we perceive advancing from the right two umiaks with
masts erect, upon which are several indefinite figures. A little farther
on, however, is shown a whale to which a line is attached, indicating
that he has been harpooned, while the shapeless figure referred to may
possibly indicate the inflated skin which is always attached to impede
progress in the case of an escaping monster of this kind. The curious
888 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

figure a short distance above the whale and directly opposite to the -
fluke spoken of in the record above, represents an island with its ele-
vated center and precipitous sides. Upon the other side of the top
varving the drawings are a little more delicate. Two of the most con-
spicuous characters on the left side represent seal nets. The two
umiaks are proceeding in the direction of a whale which appears to
have been harpooned, as at the end of a long thin line there appears
attached the usual float. The figure at the extreme end is that of a
seal, while the one to the left of it may be another animal of the same
species. Between the latter and the whale is a very small and very
delicately drawn kaiak. The man represented has a paddle, while a
spear projects backward and upward behind him.

On the under surface of the bow, between two parallel lines but a
quarter of an inch apart, are about twelve characters denoting various
animals which the hunter wishes to intimate he has killed. Some of
them can be identified, while others can not, the drawing being rather
crude.

The specimen shown in plate 59, fig. 2, is from Cape Prince of Wales,
and represents a variety of hunting records. Beginning at the left
hand along the lower edge is visible a very crudely carved figure of a
native with a spear, following two bears. To the right is a native
kneeling, preparing to shoot. The next four figures represent umiaks
loaded with native hunters going to sea.. These are followed by the
ligure of a whale which is being harpooned by the hunter in the bow of
an umiak immediately to the right. The next figure is that of a dog,
and the next a native who has hold of a thong by which he is leading
another dog. Then we observe a hunter dragging a seal, while a short
distance above this are small crosses representing birds. The next is
a walrus, to the right of which is a dog dragging a sledge upon which
is seated the owner. Turning the bow around, we perceive at the left
four >-shaped figures, indicating the end of both records. The first
figure projecting from the base line is a whale’s fluke, then several
small figures to represent walruses, then two men are observed grasping
hands, with apparently a spear between them. A large umiak is shown
in front of another walrus, two of the hunters in which have raised
their spears to cast toward some walruses lying upon a floating cake
of ice. To the right of these animals is represented a seal being
dragged by three hunters. These are preceded by another group of
three, who are also dragging home a seal. A Single native is next
shown, with a line directed to a spot near the base line, which denotes
a Seal’s head. The large fin-like character represents a fluke, as in the
first figure of this record. An umiak is then shown, one of the natives
in which is in the act of harpooning a whale, while a native in one of
the other umiaks has also a line attached to him. The record is con-
cluded by another umiak containing four men pursuing a walrus.
Upon the under side are a number of illustrations of hunters, some
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 889

harpooning walruses, while others appear to be after some reindeer
who have taken to the water. Along the narrow edges are also repre-
sentations of various objects, one side being filled more than half of
its length by a procession of dog sledges, the remainder being filled
with sealers upon ice floes, a whale, and some boatmen. The other
edge represents some very deeply incised and graphic outlines of boats
and marine hunters, the record terminating at one end with some flying
birds, while at the other two individuals dragging a seal are shown.
Plate 22, fig. 5, is a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound. The specimen
measures 164 inches in length. A sectional view of the specimen is
lozenge shaped, so that there are both above and below two faces upon
which records are engraved, making a total of four records. As repre.
sented in the illustration, the record upon the lower side consists of
seal and whale hunting scenes. At the extreme left is a rude outline
of an umiak, within which are crude representations of human beings.
The vessel is very close upon an immense whale, which is evidently
escaping from them in the direction of another umiak which appears
to be approaching it. The oblong figure to the right of the last named
umiak is an inverted boat placed upon scaffolding for the purpose of
drying. Some partly eroded figures are seen between the bow of the
boat and three men, one above the other, who are portrayed in the act
of dragging home an immense seal. Beyond this are three umiaks
filled with hunters, while still farther to the right are two or three
walruses swimming in the water. To the right of the last named is a
figure very much resembling the conventional outline of a wolf, while
beyond that, to the right, is a low elongated structure, heavily etched,
which represents a winter habitation. Above the entrance is a human
figure, with arms extended, as if attracting attention to something.
Beyond this structure, to the right, is a very delicately engraved scaf-
fold, upon which food or other similar materials are placed for safety.
Along the upper surface of this bow, beginning where the previous
story ended, we find a storehouse erected on stilts attached-to the ordi-
nary winter habitation, upon and about which are the outlines of some
human beings. <A food rack is erected above the entrance to this habi-
tation, from the horizontal bar of which are suspended objects which
are probably pieces of meat or fish, as the occupants appear to be seal
hunters, two of them being represented in the act of dragging home
seals. Just to the right of this is a grazing deer whose legs are
unnaturally long, and in front of this is an umiak holding four hunters.
The two small figures to the right of the last named are seal heads
protruding from the water. Beyond this is another umiak with four
hunters whose arms are in various attitudes as if in earnest conversa-
tion. The small mound-like figure at the bow of this boat represents
the shore, and immediately to the right are shown three natives drag-
ging home upon its back a huge seal. Beyond this animal are other
hunters similarly engaged. The oblong outline somewhat resembling
890 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

a canoe lying on its side can not be determined. To the pele of this,
however, is another figure of a seal being dragged toward the right,
and approaching two men whose arms are uplifted as if in Joy at
receiving assistance. The partly obliterated figure of a human being
is seen approaching the entrance to one of the ordinary winter habita-
tions, from the door of which, as well as from the middle portion,

appear two vertical sticks with small figures at the top, both repre-
senting votive offerings. The scaffold at the right represents a store-
house used for food or grain.

In fig. 106 is presented another illustration of the indication, picto-
tially, of what the hunter desired, or saw, and how much thereof he
secured. The three men in the baidarka are headed toward two whales,
the foremost one of the former, he in the bow, being represented in the
act of casting a harpoon, the dotted line indicating the course. The
whale struck by the weapon is headed toward the hunters, indicating
that he was captured; whereas the second whale is going in the con-
trary direction, denoting that he had been observed and very much
wanted, perhaps, but not captured. The short projections above the
heads of the whales denote fins—and seem thus to specify the finback.
The cruciform figures
denote flying birds.

A peculiarly inter-
esting specimen of art
is illustrated in fig.
107, and consists of a
flat piece of ivory, 4
inches long and 1.2
inches wide, roughly
carved and covered
with incised figures.
The specimen is made
of a fragment of an
old snow-shovel edge,
is perforated at one end, and has attached to it by a strand of sinew a
little handle formed of ivory, and represents two bowhead whales with
the heads attached, so that a slight stricture results, about which the
cord is tied.

The spiracles on the effigies are incised and blackened.

“The upper edge is carved into five distinct heads—first, a rude
bear’s head, with the eyes and nostrils incised and blackened as usual;
then four human heads, with a face on each side. The front faces have
the noses and brows in low relief, and the eyes, nostrils, and mouths

incised and blackened; the back ones are flat, with the last three
features indicated as before. At the end is a rude figure of a bear,
heading toward the right, with the ears in relief, the eyes and mouth
roughly incised and blackened, and the legs indicated by roughly
incised and blackened lines on the obverse face. Both faces are coy-
ered with rudely incised and blackened lines.

“On the obverse there is a single vertical line between each pair of
heads. Below the beavr’s head is a bear heading toward the right;
under the first human head, an umiak with four men; under the see.
ond, a ‘killer’ (Orca) heading toward the right; under the third, two
of the usual conventionalized whales’ tails suspended from a cross line;
and under the last, a ‘killer’ with very large ‘flukes’ heading toward
the left.

“On the reverse there are, below the bear, a bear heading toward
the right, below each of the human heads a whale’s tail with the flukes
up, and under the bear’s head a bear heading toward the right.”! This
end is perforated as before stated.

Fig. 108 represents a village near a stream, or the seashore. Nos. 1
and 3 are habitations, while the structure at No. 2 represents a store-

house, a box-like receptacle built upon poles within which to store food.
Upon the entrance way of No. 3 is seen a man occupied in some ordi-
nary occupation, but at his left is a vertical pole upon which is a short
transverse line, the effigy of a bird or fish, most probably the former.
This is a votive offering, or “shaman stick,” erected to the memory of
a departed member of the family. Bird carvings are deemed the best
that ean be selected, flying spirits or deinons, typified by birds, being
considered good omens, whereas walking or crawling ones are often
malevolent.

To the right of the man, over the entrance to the habitation, is another
“shaman stick,” erected probably with the same motive as the preced-
ing one, though to indicate a second person, only one stick being erected
to one individual at the same place.

The four figures seated upon the ground at the water’s edge—Nos.
4-7—denote four persons fishing, the floats being visible on the lines of
Nos. 6 and 7.

Fig. 109 represents a party of fishermen, the three figures at the
right being in a seated posture. Considerable surface erosion by con-
stant use has weakened the lines at the left side to such an extent as

to make interpretation more difficult. The long upright lines may have
been intended to denote rods, as a similar line in the hands of No. 6 is
known to be.

No. 3 may have had a rod and line attached to his hands, as in Nos.
6 and 7, but the surface here is perfectly smooth and polished, thus
obliterating all evidence
of such implements.

As many of the ivory
drill bows and bag handles
have inscribed upon them
records of seal hunts in
which are found engrav-
ings of natives dragging seal, it seems proper, if not necessary, to
illustrate the utensil with which the dragging is performed. Fig. 110
represents a seal drag, an article with which every seal hunter is pro-
vided and carries with him for dragging home his game. This consists
of a small ivory handle or knob, to which is secured a stout thong
doubled at the other end in a bight about 18 inches long. The bight is
looped into an incision in the animal’s lower jaw, while the knob serves
for attaching a longer line or the end of a dog’s harness. The seal is
dragged on his back, and runs as smoothly as a sled. The illustration
of the drag referred to above is one
of a small collection in the National
Museum, and marked as from Point
Barrow.!

Some of these ivory knobs show
slight markings or incisions to serve
as ornamentation, as shown in plate
26, fig. 5, though the greater number
are carved in symmetrical forms, and
usually in imitation of seals, whales,
or something of this kind.

Floats of inflated seal skin are used
in capturing whale and walrus. An
excellent specimen from Point Bar-
row,” fig. 111, will serve to illustrate
the general appearance of the float,
and will furthermore serve to make
intelligible the peculiar fish-like ob-
ject portrayed on some ivory records, where the seal fisher is repre-
sented as in his kaiak, with the harpoon and float projecting backward
from the body. The accompanying illustration is here reproduced from
the Point Barrow report by Mr. Murdoch.

The village in plate 70, fig. 2, is located at Nos. 1 and 2, the store-

house being at the extreme left end of the first house. Smoke is
rising from the middle elevation, while upon the entrance are two
persons, one of whom is shown with his arms elevated, as if hailing
some one, while the second appears to be in conversation with the man
on the scaffold belonging to the next house, at No. 2. On the latter
are two people pulling up a ladder to get the hunter to bring up the
meat, When the seal, dragged by No. 3, is eaten up. The hunter’s dog is
following. No.4 denotes two men pulling at a seal, while those at No.
5) are similarly engaged. Nos. 6,7, 8, and 9 are also taking home their
captures. The figure in the air, between Nos.7 and 8, resembles the
usual outline of an evil spirit, as portrayed in connection with cere-
monial performances of shamans, but in the present connection the
import of the character is unintelligible, unless the artist intended to
represent one of the natives in the act of jumping.

No. 10 denotes two seals, No. 11 a water bird, while No. 12 indicates
a canoe with the rowers standing about in conversation, in which the
inhabitants of No. 15 are participating.

Fig. 111.

INFLATED SEAL-SKIN FLOAT.

No. 14 is the storehouse or scaffold belonging to the occupants of
No. 13.

Plate 22, fig. 5, represents another drill bow or bag handle from
Kotzebue Sound. The square object on poles, at the right end upper
line, represents a cache or granary, while the dome-shaped structure is
a winter habitation, on the entrance to which is a native with his arm
directed downward, as-if indicating that place for some particular
reason. The next character represents a scaffold used for drying meat
or fish. Two men are represented as approaching the rack, both
dragging an oddly formed character, probably intended to represent
a seal. The mammal is a reindeer, while to the right is an umiak
containing four men approaching two figures, the forms of which are
not sufficiently distinct to identify.

Beyond these, however, are two seals whose heads are seen protrud-
ing from the surface of the water. Another umiak is shown, beyond
which three men are shown dragging a seal or walrus. These are
followed by three others similarly occupied. The dome-shaped figure
894 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

to the right denotes, without doubt, a similar animal upon an ice floe,
the latter being indicated by its having been left white to denote trans-
parency.

One man is seen dragging at a seal to the right of the floe, and a little
farther on are two men making gestures, the first having both hands
and arms directed upward, while the second has one arm directed to
the left of the rod, while with the other the hand is flexed toward his
head, as if beckoning to some one at his left and indicating the direction
to his right.

The walrus have been surprised by hunters, as shown in plate 70,
fig. 3, many of them swimming away, as shown in No. 3, one animal
having its young still resting upon its back. The ice pan at No. 2 has
three animals remaining upon it, a young walrus at its mother’s back
being indicated in the middle figure, while the largest figure is already
harpooned, its flippers (?) being extended in its endeavor to slip into
the sea and escape. The middle boatman in No. 4 is holding aloft his
paddle, thus calling for assistance, the signal being visible, perhaps, by
other hunters, who will at once respond. In No.5 the hunter had har-
pooned his walrus, which immediately attempted to escape by resorting

to an ice pan, upsetting the canoe and dragging it upon the ice, and at
the same time throwing into the water the unfortunate hunter, whose
head and shoulders are seen projecting above the base line, here indi-
cating, also, the water line.

In fig. 112 is shown a remarkably graphic illustration. The artist
was of more than ordinary cleverness, and the engraving scarcely
requires any description. The animals noted in No. 1, the middle one
on the ice Fan in No. 5, and the one to the right—the last but one—are
each shown with their young upon the back.

The ice pan upon which the animals had been floating is indicated by
an outline only, the body being left white and in imitation of nature.

Plate 21, fig. 2, represents the back of bow shown elsewhere. As
before, there is an upper and lower face upon which hunting records
are portrayed. Beginning with the upper surface at the right-hand
side, we perceive four walruses, to the right of which is an umiak oceu-
pied by four hunters. The one in the bow appears to have a short-
handled ax, while the second has one arm uplifted, and directed forward
from the mouth appears a short line terminating in zigzag, which is
believed not to be accidental but intentional, and indicates voice or
speech, sound being portrayed in other pictographs as well, seemingly

— Il.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 895

indicating this extent of acquaintance with the recording of subjective
ideas. The third person in the boat is using the paddle, while the one
at the stern has a weapon of some kind with which he is attempting to
keep off an aggressive walrus which is following them.

To the right of this is another umiak paddling toward the right in
the direction of the three walruses represented. Above the middle
of this is a small cross which denotes a bird. The next figure repre-
sents an umiak in which are four people close to the body of a whale
which has been harpooned. The elongated curved figure resting upon
two short vertical lines represents a boat on shore and on a seaffold
drying. Ata distance of about 14 inches from this is shown a whale
in the act of diving, as is intimated by the fact of the greater portion
of the body being directed upward while the head is down in the water,
as shown by the spray which emanates from the blow hole in contact
withthe surface. The oblong cross above this represents a bird. The
adjoining characters to the right can not be definitely determined.
The figures at the end, however, represent two winter habitations with
the accompanying granaries and the presence of human figures.

Turning the bow around and following the remaining faces from the
left hand, we find first a winter habitation with smoke rising from the
center, infront of whichis a tent with a vertical pole projecting upward
atthe right. A native is seen dragging home a seal, while to the right
are more human figures apparently embarking in umiaks, three of these
vessels being under way. Beyond the bow of the right-hand boat and
upon the base line are two figures which represent seals, while of the
two in the air the one at the left represents a fox or wolf and that at
the right a bird. The remaining half of the space upon this bow is
filled with a procession of natives dragging home seals, eight of these
animals being shown. The vertical sticks used by these natives are
seal spears, which they employ to aid locomotion.

Plate 24, fig. 3, represents a drill bow from Nubuiakhechugaluk,
collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson.

The specimen measures 12,%; inches in length, and is rudely decorated
both above and beneath. The figure at the extreme left is partly
obliterated. The next represents a native in his kaiak in the act of
throwing a harpoon toward a walrus, which he is closely pursuing, and
beyond which are four other animals of the same species. The next
figure represents an umiak with three occupants, the one nearest the
bow being represented as in the act of throwing a harpoon. Two large
crude figures of walruses are between this boat and another umiak, in
which are three persons, the one at the stern being shown with the
rudder, the one in the middle having both arms extended and upward
as if in surprise, and the one at the bow being in the act of throwing a
harpoon toward a whale. Above this are five birds, indicated by crude
crosses. To the right of the whale is a native with bow and arrow,
preparing to shoot toward a reindeer. The triangular figure to the
896 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

right of the reindeer appears to be a summer habitation, while the
figure of a mammal at the extreme right is not drawn with sufficient
accuracy to admit of identification. The under side of the bow con-
tains characters the import of which is very much the same as that of
those just enumerated. The edges of the bow are decorated with hori-
zontal incised lines.

The record given in plate 60, fig. 2, embraces several different
exploits. In No.1 the helmsman at the end of the large canoe is hold-
ing aloft the double-bladed a to attract attention and to call for
assistance, as a walrus, No. , is making an attack upon the native in
the kaiak, No. 3. The leaning figure in the stem end of the kaiak is
the inflated seal skin used as a float in hunting whale and walrus.
No. 4 is rock and indicates shore, near which is No. 5, a large animal.
The canoe party at No. 6 are ee making signals, seals having been
discovered; No. 9, toward which the native in the kaiak, No. 8, is
going, having piroaday thrown his harpoon as indicated by the weapon
before the bow, and securing one seal as noted by the harpoon pro-
truding from its back.

Both boats are near a large rock showing a water-worn cavity, as
in) Now 7.

Another native, armed with harpoon and float, is paddling along at
No. 10. The figures at No. 11 and 12 are either partly worn away or
incomplete and are unintelligible.

The regularity with which the hunters and their captured seals are
depicted in plate 60, fig. 3,is a step in the direction of the decorative—
representation of a hunting exploit.

Each of the hunters has secured an animal, the hunter dragging
No. 2 seal having a bow and arrow while the otters have harpoons,
the weapon being cleverly indicated by the barbed head in the hands
of the native dragging seal No. 10.

Fourteen seals were secured, only one getting away from the slaughter,
as indicated in No. 15,

The illustration in plate 60, fig. 4, is interesting because of an attempt
at perspective. The record was too comprehensive to be engraved upon

the ivory surface available, and as there were more canoes employed in»

the hunt than could be drawn along one line, in consecutive order, three
of them are raised to appear as if they were in the air, though in reality
beyond the two touching the water line in the foreground. The canoes
at No. 2 are for one person only, while that at No. 3 has nine people in
it. The walrus, which the party is evidently going to attack, are at

No. 1. Nos. 4 to 11 embraces the habitations referring to the fact that —

a village is located there, while the scaffolds—with the exception of No.
6—are for canoes, the vessels being inverted and the paddles projecting
beneath. The exception referred to is a food scaffold, to which a flight
of steps has been placed. Two persons are observed on the roof of the
house at No. 5, watching the departure of their friends, while a short

column of smoke is seen arising from the middle elevation of the habi-
tation.

At No. 4, food is seen suspended beneath the inverted boat, while
above it the harpoon is projecting, showing that the weapon is kept
near at hand for immediate use, should oceasion demand it.

The engraving in plate 70, fig. 4, presents interesting details in the
portrayal of various attitudes assumed by walrus Nos. 4, 7,9 and 11, as
well as the specific difference between
the canoes, the baidarka holding more
than one person, and the kaiak, gen-
erally, but for one person. The former
is shown in various styles, as Nos. 1, 2,
and 3, while the latter is represented in
Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14. The small
cross above No. 3 denotes a bird in
flight, as also the two figures of like
form above the seal at No. 7. A large
water fowl still remains upon the water
before the bow of the kaiak at No. 8.

The hunter in the kaiak No. 6 has
thrown his harpoon into a walrus, while
the occupants of Nos. 10 and 12 have
raised their weapons preparatory to throwing them. The elongated
objects projecting from the kaiaks, behind the occupants, Nos. 10, 12,
and 13, are inflated seal skins used as floaters for the harpoon line,
to impede the speed of the harpooned animal, and also to prevent
its escape by remaining too long underwater or to
trace its course while there.

ager Fig. 113 is reproduced from a small slab of wood,
and is explained as follows:

Seal hunters thus inform their comrades that they have returned
home: The first to return to the regular landing place sometimes sticks
a piece of wood into the ground leaning toward the village, upon which
is drawn or scratched the outline of a baidarka or canoe heading toward
one or more outlines or lodges, signifying that the occupants have gone
toward their houses.

NAT MUS 95 5

898 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

In this connection may be mentioned a common device used by the
natives of southern Alaska and Kadiak to indicate direction taken or
to be taken. When hunters become separated the one first return-
ing to the forks of the trail puts a piece of wood in the ground, on the
fon of which he makes an incision, into which a short piece of wood is
secured horizontally so as to point in the direction taken.

This device is sometimes drawn upon ivory and other materials, in
connection with-other objects to make pictographic records, and then
simply represents a character like the letter T, the upper crosspiece
being very short in comparison with the vertical stroke.

The practice of erecting such sticks to indicate direction is very com-
mon to the tribes living along the Great Lakes, especially the Crees
and the Ojibwa.

Plate 25, fig. 2, represents a snuffbox of walrus ivory. This speci-
men, which was obtained at Norton Sound, is crude and very old. Upon
the upper border or margin is a line encircling the specimen, upon
which is a series of very interesting although crude figures. The only
engraved character below the line, upon one side, is a very rude sledge
attached to a long-necked dog.

The pipe represented in plate 71 measures 1035 inches in length along
the lower outer curve, while the ornamental head in front is 1 inch in
length. The latter is easily removed, being merely an ornamental head
of the peg used to plug the drilled tube of the pipestem. The stem is
three fourths of an inch in lateral diameter and about 14 inches through
the stem at the back of the bowl—from top to bottom. The bowl and
its supporting stem is 14 inches in height. Upon either side of the rim
of the bowl is a carved human face with blackened eyes and mouth,
the nose being quite pronounced.

The engravings occupy the four sides of the stem, the two lower
panels being reserved for boating scenes, while the upper are retained
for game and village scenes. Upon the upper right-hand side are six
reindeer, followed by a wolf, while before the foremost reindeer is the
figure of a man in the attitude of following sea fowl, evidently in the
attempt to secure some.

Beneath this scene is a fleet of eight umiaks, under rail, while in
each vessel are the outlines of human figures, one at the bow of the
leading umiak reaching toward, or grasping, the foresail stay, while
every helmsman has his oar to steer his boat. In the fifth boat—forward
from the mouthpiece of the pipe—is one native smoking his pipe.

On the left-hand side, in the lower space, are six kaiaks, each having
its occupant using the paddle, while toward the stem is seen projecting
the harpoon and seal-skin float, ready and inflated for use.

The upper space portrays a village scene, in the middle being the
dome-shaped winter habitation, {rom which smoke is issuing; three
persons upon the roof of the entrance are watching the return of the
hunters, one raising his arms as if hailing the latter with pleasure at

— =
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 899

their safe or successful return. The hunters are at the left dragging
along their kaiaks upon sledges. The figure placed upon stilts is an
winiak, suspended for drying and protection, while beneath it is a dog
and his master approaching the entrance of the habitation.

At the right is a storehouse or granary, built above the ground, and
near it a man calling or urging forward the dog hitched to the sledge,
upon which is placed a load and one person.

The artistic execution of the engravings is good. The lines are very
uniform in depth and width, showing the artist to have been an expert
in the use of the graver as pertains to the mechanical part of the
etching, at least. :

The lines are all filled in or stained with a very black substance,
giving the work rather a harsh and new appearance and not so soft
and warm in tone as some of the older and more worn specimens.

The engraving in plate 40, fig. 1, is very bold and seems to present
strong evidence of perspective drawing, not through mere accident but
from intention. The gradual diminution in the size of the buildings
and store racks at the left end of the record is very cleverly done.
The tigure at No. 9 is a baidarka inverted upon the rack so as to permit
it to dry, while the rod upon the entrance to the house at No. 8 is a
votive offering, erected to the memory of one of the household. The
man upon the roof is speaking and gesticulating to those at No. 6.

The parties in the canoes, Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13, are leaving to visit
another village, indicated by a large habitation and storehouse, Nos.
14 and 15, about which the four human figures are portrayed as making
gestures, both beckoning—by the hand raised—and pointing to the
house, as if desiring the visitors to come there.

There is no evidence of want of food, or death, as indicated in some
other records presented herein, but simply an exhibition of gladness at
the return of friends or visitors who appear to have come within hailing
distance.

The excitement caused by the arrival of two whaling ships is cleverly
portrayed in plate 40, fig.2. At No. 1 is a baidarka still upon the dry-
ing poles, while the natives at No. 2 are excitedly rushing toward it to
put to water and to follow the other boats already under way to visit the
ships. The boats Nos. 5 to 7 are all going along toward the anchored
eraft, Nos. 8 and 9, the anchor chains being designated by zigzag lines,
thus more emphatically indicating links.

The canoes at Nos. 10 and 12 are coming from another direction, and
the native on the bow of No. 10 is hailing the helmsman on the ship
No. 9. The natives in both boats at the right have oars for rud-
ders. No. 11 is a flock of birds.

The record reproduced in fig. 115 illustrates another method of giv-
ing information with regard to distress in another village, which occa-
sioned the departure of the person by whom the notification was given.
The designs were traced upon a narrow strip of wood, which was then

900 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

stuck upon the roof ef the house belonging to the draftsman, and
made to lean in the direction of the course to be taken.

This is shown in No. 1, the narrow projection upon the apex of the
roof denoting the stick; No.2 is the baidarka, containing the residents
of the house; No. 3 is a grave stick, indicating a death in the settle-
ment to which the trip is made, the stick being a votive offering, erected
to the memory of the deceased; Nos. 4 and 5 denote the houses of the
village, the triangular one being made by leaning together boards or
slabs, and is termed a summer house, while the dome-shaped one, made
more compactly and covered with turf, denotes a permanent or winter
residence. Both kinds are represented, and by this method of synec-

doche the village is indicated by portraying only one of each kind com-
posing the settlement.

The design shown in fig, 116 is in imitation of drawings made by the
natives of southern Alaska to convey to the observer the information
that the draftsman had gone away to another settlement, the inhabi-
tants of which were in distress. The drawings were made on a strip
of wood which was placed at the door of the house, where it might be
seen by visitors or inquirers.

Vladimir Naomoff, the native to whom reference has before been made,
and who drew for the present writer the specimen under consideration,
gave the following explanation: No. 1 is a native making the gesture

indicating self with the right hand, and with the left indicating the
direction of going. No. 2 is the native’s habitation, a winter or perma-
nent residence, dome-shaped, partly underground, with the roof thinly
covered with turf to keep out the extreme cold. No.3 is a seaffold used
for drying fish; upon the top of the pole is placed a piece of wood tied
so that the longest end points in the direction to be taken by the relief
party. No. 4 is the baidarka containing the party. No. 5, a native of
the settlement to be visited. No. 6, a summer habitation. No. 7is a é
shaman or grave stick, a votive offering erected to the memory of a
recently deceased person, the cause which necessitated the journey.
No. 8 is a winter habitation, in which the deceased had resided. The
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 901

winter residence, No. 8, together with the summer lodge in No. 6, denotes
the settlement.

The record on plate 40, fig. 3, embracing Nos. 1 to 10, is similar in
style to one explained by Naomoff, and pertains to the designation of
geographic or rather topographic features of an area of country between
thatoceupied by the recorder and another
place to which reference is made.

No.1 denotes three birds flying in the
air, and No. 2 has reference to four seals,
both groups of creatures being at a shore
line, as the tree at No. 3 resembling a pine
indicates. The group of trees immedi-
ately to the right denotes a grove or woods, indicated by a group of
trees being placed close together. No.4 is a human being and the inten-
tion of the recorder is to imply that natives are resident there—beyond
the woods. Another grove or forest occurs beyond the settlement. as
indicated by the group of trees at No. 5, beyond which another hamlet
is situated.

Then comes another forest at No. 7, beyond which is a locality abound-
ing in seals, No.8. Beyond this is a range of timbered hills, the upland
being indicated by a semicircle covered with short vertical lines to
denote the timber.

No. 10 is an ornamental mark similar to No. 18 in import, and serves
to denote the end of that particular record.

A hunting scene begins with No. 11; the
whale is moving toward the right, spouting,
causing the walrus, No. 12, to move out of the
way. Water fowl are seen at No. 13; while the
elevations at No. 14, over which some birds are
flying and at the left base of which is another walrus, appear to be
rocks protruding from the sea.

At No. 15 are two other walrus, while at Nos. 16 and 17 are two
approaching whaling ships.

The character at No. 18 concludes the history.

COMBAT.

But few illustrations occur in the ivory records in the National
Museum collections in which personal combat is portrayed. Wrest-
ling is shown, in one instance, under the caption of Pastimes and
Games, while another denoting a struggle and combat with a walrus,
both being in the water, is given below.

Fig. 117 represents an Alaskan in the water killing a walrus. The
exploit was deemed of sufficient importance to perpetuate it by record-
ing the illustration upon a slab of ivory, now in the museum of the
Alaska Commercial Company, San Francisco, California.

Two men having a serious altercation over a seal are shown in fig.
118. One is unarmed, while the other has a bow and arrow which he

has threatened to use. The unarmed man’s hands are in attitudes of
gesture. :

~ ‘The two struggling men, plate 40, fig. 4, No. 1, appear in the attitude
of wrestling, but the rapid approach of two others, No. 2, with spears
in the attitude of charging or thrusting, seems to lend more serious-
nessto the record. The position of the legs of the combatants indicates
the portrayal of considerable strength being exerted.

Nos. 3 and 8 are houses, the latter showing the column of smoke
considerably curved downward to the right, denoting a strong breeze
from the opposite direction. No. 4 is a water bird, probably a duck,
while No. 5 denotes a seal. An animal of this species has been cap-
tured by the hunter, No. 6, who is dragging it home to the house, No.8,
while his wife—perhaps some other inmate—stands at the entrance and
with both hands makes the gesture of request or invitation to enter, the
hands being thrown toward the threshold. Nos. 9, 10, and 11 are dog
sledges being brought back by traders from some other locality. The
sleds are loaded. The attitudes assumed by the men in aiding the dogs
in pulling are very cleverly depicted. Considerable effort is expressed
in the leader of the sledge at No. 10, while pushing is done by other
persons at the rear at Nos. 9 and 10. No. 11 is lightiy loaded, as the

owner is seated upon the sledge, while his companion is walking leis-
urely along behind.

The illustration in fig. 119 represents a village, upon which an attack
is made by some natives from another locality.

The figure of a rack—a pole suspended horizontaliy upon two verti-
cal forked posts—-is shown in No.1. Fish for drying are seen attached,
the regularity of the short vertical strokes being evidence of the char-
acter of the food. Nos. 2 to 6,7, and 9 are conical huts made of boards
and saplings, such habitations as are erected by hunting parties when
they find game sufficient in any special place to prompt their going to
so much labor for their protection against rain or cold. In Nos. 8, 10,
11, 12, and 13 alarm is expressed by the signal for assistance, the arms
being held aloft and waved to attract attention and to indicate that
the presence of the beholder is desired.

No. 14 is a tree, from behind which the enemy shot an arrow which
caused the alarm. The enemy had come up unperceived.

IDEOGRAPHY.,

This subject embraces one of the most interesting in the entire realm
of pictography. Among the Eskimo there is less evidence of ability in
this direction than among some of our Indian tribes. Gesture signs
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 903

are common to all mankind, but in the greater part of the United
States the sign language is rapidly falling into disuse, both because of
the destruction of the buffalo, the pursuit of which was participated
in by many tribes of diverse languages, a condition which brought
about a most highly developed gesture language, and also because of
the rapid settlement of the country and the consequent restrictions of
Indians traveling from piace to place, which also served to keep alive
gesture speech. The adoption of the Spanish lan-

guage by the Indians on the southwest border, and

the Chinook jargon in the north, also helped to resume

the need of a resort to gesture, the present methods fr

of oral speech, mutually intelligible, being vastly

superior and more satisfactory. SOLE

The use of gesture speech by the Eskimo is well “YS DCUNS MAKING
known, and repeated instances showing the attempted
reproduction, graphically, of gesture signs occur in the ivory records,
some examples of which are reproduced.

To facilitate further study in this line of investigation, the writer
submits a collection of gesture signs used by the Eskimo and other
tribes of southern Alaska, a collection made some years since, though
hitherto unpublished.

PICTOGRAPHS OF GESTURE SIGNS.

No. 1 of fig. 120 represents a shaman waving his hands and arms, as
if he were stirring up the air above his head, the motive being the
invocation of benign spirits to aid him in his work. The rested figure
shown in No, 2, denotes the man making application for aid, and his
arms are extended upward in like manner, but in this instance denoting
supplication, the difference between the two being that the latter is
rested upon the ground to indicate his asking for aid, whereas the

shaman is portrayed not only erect, but in the attitude of
dancing, with his song and incantations.

The illustration given in fig. 121 is taken from an ivory
drill bow in the National Museum, marked as from Norton

Rig-121- Sound, Alaska. The figure represents the gesture sign, or
SIGNAL OF DIS- _.- Se Sere; :
ene signal of discovery. In this instance the game consists of

whales, and the signal is made by holding the boat paddle
aloft and horizontally.

Fig. 122 represents a number of natives fishing through the .ice,for
seal. The individual represented at No. 1 is dragging an animal out
of the water, a hole having been cut for breathing place at which these
animals make their appearance. No.2 has a seal upon the ice and
appears to have great difficulty in pulling it along. No.3 is preparing
to spear an animal, his watchful attitude being apparent. No. 4 is
holding aloft his harpoon or lance, making a signal that he has discoy-
ered game, or hears it, and thereby warns others near by to be silent.
904 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

No. 5 is about to thrust his lance through the hole into the water
beneath. No. 6 has stuck his harpoon into the ice and is erecting a
shade over the hole so as to permit him to see beneath, while No. 7 has
thrust his weapon downward through the ice.

Mr. Dall! mentions a practice adopted by the Aleuts when hunting
otter, by which the fact of having thrown the spear is intimated to his
companions, when they will at once paddle aud form a circle around

the spot so as to attack with spear the animal when it returns to the
surface to breathe. The signal is graphically portrayed in the follow-
ing illustration, in which several hunters had such exploits, and also
in many others, in some of which, however, the signal may also denote
the idea to come, a call for assistance when the animal is thought to be
liable to escape or to be unmanageable.

The fishermen found a small school of whales, as shown in fig. 123,

SIGNALING FOR ASSISTANCE; WHALES.

and three of them have been harpooned while a fourth is escaping.
Help to secure the monsters is required, and all of the occupants of the
boats are making the signal for assistance by holding horizontally
above the head the boat paddle. This signifies come, and also, under
other circumstances, game found.

Fig. 124 represents a record of a hunt, made for the present writer

ones made by the natives of the southern coast of Alaska, to inform
their visitors or friends of their departure for a purpose designated.
They are depicted upon pieces of wood, which are placed in conspicu-
ous places near the doors of the habitations.

The following is the explanation of the characters: No.1, the speaker,
with the right hand indicating: himself and with the left pointing in the
direction taken; No. 2, holding a boat paddle, going by boat; No. 3, the
speaker holding the right hand to the side of the head, to denote sleep,

and the left elevated with one finger erect to signify one night; No. 4,
a circle with two marks in the middle, signifying an island with huts
upon it; No. 5 same as No. 1; No. 6, a circle to denote another island
where they touched; No. 7, similar to No. 3, with an additional finger
elevated, to signify two nights or sleeps; No. 8, the speaker with his
harpoon, the weapon with which he sometimes hunted, and with the
left making the gesture sign to denote sea lion. The hand is held edge-
wise, with the thumb elevated, then pushed outward from the body in
a slightly downward curve. No. 9 represents a sea lion, which the
hunter, No. 10, secured by shooting with bow and arrow. No.11 is the

boat with two persons in it, the paddles projecting downward beneath
it. No. 12 1s the winter habitation of, the speaker.

The record given in fig. 125 was also drawn for the present writer by
Vladimir Naomoff.

Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 represent the person spoken to, and no arms are
indicated, aS no response is supposed to be made by him. No. 2 indi-
cates the speaker with his right hand to his side or breast, indicat-
ing self, the left hand pointing in the direction in which he is going.
No. 4, both hands of the speaker are elevated, with fingers and thumbs
extended, signifying many. When the hands are thus held up, in sign
language, it signifies ten, but when they are brought toward and back-
ward from one another, many. Among the “ Plains Indians” of Indian
Territory, when both hands are thus held up for ten, and then thrown
downward to the left, it signifies ten times ten or one hundred. The

Fig. 126.

latter practice of indicating any number multiplied by ten, by thus
throwing to the left both hands, has not been found to obtain among
the Alaskan natives. No.6, the right hand is placed to the side of
the head to denote sleep or night; in this instance denoting many sJeeps,
or, in other words, many nights and days; the left hand points down-
ward to denote at that place. No. 8, the right hand is directed toward
the starting point, while the left is brought upward toward the head—
to go home, or whence he came.

The drawing represented in fig. 126 was made by an Alaskan native
to illustrate that he contemplated making a journey to hunt, and the

result of that tour. No.1 is an undulating line extending from left to
right, and represents the contour lines of the country and mountain
peaks; No.2 represents the native going from home; No. 3, stick placed
on a hilltop, with a bunch of grass attached—so as to be more readily
visible—pointing in the direction he took; No. 4 represents the native
of another settlement, with whom the traveler remained over night;
No. 5 is the habitation of the figure in No. 4; No. 6, a long vertical
stroke, representing the end of the first day, i. e., the time between
two days—rest; No, 7, the traveler is again shown to be on the way;
No. 8, making a signal that on the second day (the right hand raised,
with two fingers extended, tivo) he saw deer, No. 9, the left hand point-
ing in the direction of the animal. No.9 represents the deer facing the
hunter, which attitude is an indication that the animal was secured.

In fig. 127a is indicated the course pursued by one of a hunting party,
who decided to return home, leaving
information en route as to direction. He
ascends the nearest elevation of ground,
a hilltop or ridge, and ties a bunch of

tion taken. When another hill is ascended, another stick with similar

attachment is erected, again leaning in the direction to be taken. These

sticks are placed at proper intervals until the village is sighted, the left

hand semicircular or dome-shaped body denoting the settlement shown
by synecdoche.

The drawing shown in fig. 127) was also made by Naomoff for the
present writer, to illustrate that a settlement had been attacked by a
hostile party and finally deserted. The last one to leave prepares the
drawing upon a strip of wood to inform his friends of the resort of the
survivors. No. 1 represents three hills or ranges, signifying that
the course taken would carry them beyond that number of hills; No. 2,
the draftsman, indicating the direction, with the left hand pointing
to the ground, one hill, and the right hand indicating the number fvvo,
the number still to be crossed; No. 3, a circular piece of wood or
leather, with the representation of a face, placed upon a pole and facing
the direction to be taken from the settlement. In this instance the
drawing of the character denotes a hostile attack upon the village, for
which misfortune such devices are sometimes erected. Nos. 4 and 5
indicate summer and winter habitations. No. 6 is a storehouse erected
upon upright poles so as to be beyond the reach of predatory animals.
The latter device is used by the coast natives generally.

Fig. 128 represents hunters who have been unfortunate and are
suffering from hunger. The figures are scratched or drawn upon a
piece of wood, and placed where there is the greatest chance of its dis-
covery by passers. The stick bearing the devices is stuck in the

sufferers. The following

No. 1 is a horizontal STARVING EUNTERS

indicating that the persons are fishermen; No. 2,a man with both arms
extended, signifying in gesture language nothing, corresponding to the
ordinary gesture for negation; No.3 is a companion with the right hand
placed to the mouth, signifying to eat, the left pointing to the house
occupied by the hunters, and indicating at that place there is nothing
to eat; No. 4 represents the shelter occupied by the sufferers.

The record in fig. 129 is similar to the preceding and is used for a

like purpose. No.1 represents the baidarka, showing double projec-
tions at the bow in imitation of some forms of the canoe, the two strokes
at the other end representing the occupants of the boat. No. 2 repre-
sents aman making the gesture for nothing, both hands thrown hori-
zontally outward toward either side. No. 3 has his right hand placed
to the mouth to denote to eat, the left pointing to the habitation, No. 4,
indicating that there is nothing to eat in that house.

Shown in No. 3. As elsewhere stated with reference to the position or
attitude of animals, it will be perceived that the two deer, represented
in Nos. 1 and 2, were secured by shooting, the gun being indicated in
No. 3. No. 4 represents a man with a gun held transversely above the
head, this being a signal to denote come, or approach, while the indi-
viduals in Nos, 5, 6, and 7 are in various attitudes with extended arms
908 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

hands, and fingers. No. 5 is represented in the act of making a gesture
synonymous with that in No. 4, attracting attention and beckoning to
another to approach.

No. 6 likewise shows the gestures to come or approach, the direction
of the hands being earthward, corresponding exactly with a common
and widespread gesture for the person called to approach stealthily.
Indications by gesture to come are uniformly, amongst the North
American Indians and Innuit, made by turning the palm downward
and drawing the extended index finger toward the body, as if directly
indicating the path upon which the person beckoned to is directed to
approach.

In No. 7 the gesture appears still more excited, and the skill in
pictorial expression is certainly very cleverly indicated. The right
hand of the figure calls to the beholder to come, while with the left
hand, as with the right, the number four is indicated, as is also the
case with the figure in No. 6. The reason of this is apparent in Nos.
8, 9, 10, and 11, denoting four black or perhaps cinnamon bears, whose
heads are directed away from the group of human figures, and espe-
cially so from No. 5, who thus intimates that he was informed by his

friends of four bears having been seen in a direction pointed to by the
left hand of No. 7, but which he did not secure.

Had the heads been directed toward the speaker or owner of the
record, as in the instance of the two deer, the information would have
signified that the bears had been captured.

An interesting and rarely found engraving is reproduced herewith
in fig. 131. Specimens of like import were described to the present
writer, and pencil drawings made to illustrate the manner in which the
Aigaluyamut Eskimo of the southern shores of Alaska convey the
intelligence that they want assistance and that they possess nothing.

The figures shown in Nos. 1 and 4 represent the habitations of two
families, the storehouse, No. 2, being common property. Nos.3, 5, 6, 7,
and the human figure standing upon the habitation marked No. 4 are
making signals, all excepting No. 7, calling attention by their uplifted
hands and arms, while No. 7 has his atms extended, to denote nothing,
this being a universal gesture for that idea. The Egyptian hieroglyphs
and the Maya pictograph, as mentioned by De Landa in his represen-
tation of alphabetic characters, are drawn in the attitude of out-
stretched arms, no other part of the body being present or necessary.

The conventional gesture sign used by the Indians of the United
States is to throw the flat right hand outward to the right, the hand in
the first position being in front of the right side at the height of the
elbow.

Some tribes and European nations who are still profuse and _prolifie
in gesture as an accompaniment to speech frequently employ both
hands, moving them outward from the front toward either side, bring-
ing the palms uppermost, and at the same time giving the shoulders a
slight shrug, an unconscious though effective emphasis to the gesture.

The accompanying figure (132) represents at Nos. 2,3, and 4 the hab-
itations of a village of which the author or owner of the record is a
member. No. 1 denotes a water fowl. No. 2 is a habitation, from the
roof of which project three shaman sticks, erected as votive offerings
to deceased members of the household. The owner is also apparent on
the roof, occupied by domestic duties. No.5 is another house, from the
roof of which is seen the issuings of smoke. No. 4 is another long
house, from the right hand end of whichis seen projecting a stick indi-
cating the direction taken by the owner in his departure for another
locality. No.5 represents a swan (the uppermost figure), which was
observed by the traveler on his journey, as also an animal, the specific
namie of which could not be ascertained. No. 6, however, is the traveler

himself seated on his dog sledge, holding in his hand a whip, with which
he is urging the dog to hasten, as the end of the journey is near at
hand. He is preceded by another native (No. 7), whom he caught up
with, who was dragging home some game. No.8 is the house of the
person whom the traveler is going to visit. The left-hand figure sees
him coming, and shows his pleasure by extending his arm horizontally,
to inform others of the village that he sees the stranger approaching.
The figure on the meat pole is said to be exceedingly pleased at the
news, and is seen performing some athletic feat on the horizontal pole
mentioned. Another of the household is occupied at the storehouse
(No. 9) in preparing for the storing of the game captured by No, 7.
Smoke observed issuing from the roof of the habitation No. 8 is
similar to that in No. 3, and resembles also in graphie execution the
tail of the dog in No.6. Upon comparison it will be found that the
water thrown up by a whale in blowing is represented in like manner.

ABSTRACT IDEAS.

But few instances denoting, or perhaps even suggesting, abstra
ideas have been met with. The following examples embrace also ges-
ture language as well as an attempt at recording subjective ideas.
910 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

It is seldom that the indication of speech is attempted by the Eskimo,
but in fig. 133 an excellent portrayal of the idea of urging by means
of the voice, or calling, is given. The two men are traveling with a
sledge and three dogs, the foremost of the figures having a line extend-
ing from the side of the head—presumably the mouth—to thele ader
of the dogs. The idea is also exhibited in other pictographs made by
Eskimo, and is not of rare
occurrence in pictographie
drawings of the natives of
Kadiak, as stated by Vladi-
mir Naomoff.

Voice lines are frequently
and similarly portrayed by the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Dakota Indians.
In pictographs relating to hunting expeditions and pastimes the first-
named tribe is perhaps one of the most advanced in expressing pic-
torially some of the more difficult ideas, not only objective ones but
subjective as well.

The line extending from the mouth to denote speech is a visible pre-
sentation of the common gesture sign for the same idea, made by
passing forward from the mouth the extended index finger.

Fig. 133.
NATIVE SPEAKING TO DOG.

Fig. 134.
SHORE LINE, OR WATER MARKS.

The elevated left hand of the leader of the party is an additional
indication that he is urging the dogs to quicken their pace, or perhaps
to exert greater effort in pulling the sledge.

The illustration in fig. 134 represents several men carrying an
umiak. The vessel at No.3 is raised above the ground, the four lines
resembling props or supports being the men’s legs. The boat is being
carried toward the water, the shore lines being indicated by the vertical
curves at No.2. The artist felt that he had not the skill in perspec-
tively showing the water’s edge, and so
places the water lines in a position in
which they may clearly be observed.
The four crosses at the left of the engrav- gee
ing denote waterfowl, while the figures Se
at No. 4 denote a standing one in conversation and gesture with the
departing ones, and another seated upon the ground.

A good portrayal of the whale is given in fig. 135. The spray—a small
character for which is placed over the highest ridge of the head—is
portrayed to specify the nature of the mammal. ‘The oblique line pro-
truding from the back is the harpoon which was used in the capture.

An interesting fact connected with this pictograph is the representa- ~

tion of death, i. e., a dead whale or killed whale, determined by the
presence of the instrument with which death was accomplished. This
is rare in Innuit pictography, but frequent in Indian art.

Plate 68, fig. 3, is a large bag handle from Cape Nome. This is par-
ticularly interesting from the fact of the presence of a variety of
human forms, some resembling the bird-like forms or wings very much
resembling the characters for “ Thunderbird,” as portrayed by the
Ojibwa and other Algonkian tribes. The left half of the lower face of
the bow represents umiaks with hunters and harpoons. Near the
middle of the record is a very gracefully drawn whale tail up in the
air, as the animal appears to be diving while the hunter is throwing
his harpoon into its body. Upon the upper half of this same side of
the bow, the two sides being divided by parallel median lines, are a
number of whale tails, indicating whales that have escaped, while
others are shown in the attitude of swimming. Near the left is a very
conspicuous umiak occupied by four hunters. Over the bow of the
boat projects a large harpoon resting upon the harpoon rest. This
illustration is reproduced elsewhere with further explanation. The
upper or convex side of the bow is also divided into two longitudinal
ridges or faces. Upon one of these is the portrayal of umiaks rowing
toward the left, one hunter harpooning an animal, while at the extreme
left four hunters appear to be carrying an umiak toward the water, as
if preparing for departure. The right half of the record appears to
represent the other line, as there are several habitations with smoke
rising from the smoke holes, votive offerings attached near by, as well
as seatfolds. in this instance the latter are evidently for burial pur-
poses and not for food. This is made clear from the fact that the
votive offerings are placed in close contact with the respective burials.
A little farther to the right are three men returning with a sledge and
a single dog, two additional persons appearing to lag behind, as if
wearied or bent with age. The representation of a human figure car-
rying a staff is a common indication of age or indigence, and occurs
very frequently in Egyptian hieroglyphs, as well as in the mnemonic.
One of the individuals shown in the Eskimo record stoops forward
very much, and this is believed to indicate age. Immediately behind
him is the rude outline of a fox, which may have reference to his being
a Shaman, or he may possibly have captured such an animal. To the
right is a figure denoting a whale’s fluke, indicating that the hunters
are also whalers, because to the right of this fluke is an umiak with
two persons sitting in it using the paddle. The hunter in the bow of
this boat has his paddle projecting forward and not quite touching the
water, the perspective being admirably represented, as it does not cut
through and destroy the structure of the boat. Upon the other face of
this same bow are several umiaks in pursuit of a whale and several
natives dragging seals, two of these natives having attached to the rear
part of their bodies appendages drawn exactly like a dog’s tail or a fox’s
912 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

tail, which indicates that the natives belon ged to those classes referred
to by Captain Beechey in his Notice of the Indians of Schisma Reef
Inlet, who wore such ornaments attached to their clothing, giving them
a ridiculous appearance, and may probably have oceasioned the report
of the Chukche that the people of that region have tails like dogs.

The remaining figures upon this bow consists of human beings and a
few animal forms, near the extreme right being a curious outline of an
umiak, the occupants of which are shown with extended arms from
which numerous short lines project. These may denote the fur upon
the sleeves of the dress, or they may have other signification, or they
may possibly be merely a fancy of the engraver.

SHAMANISM.

Although the Eskimo are extremely superstitious, and numbers of
them are recognized shamans of ability, yet there seems to be a gen-
eral scarcity of pictographic matter pertaining thereto. Thisis strange,
too, as among some peoples the records are almost entirely devoted to
shamanistic ceremonies, and in several instances, as among the Ojibwa,
for instance, the mnemonic and hunting records—all shamanistic—are
the only relies of pictography at this day.

MYTHIC ANIMALS.

But a few specimens portraying mythic animals oceur, the following
being the most conspicuous:

The accompanying specimen, on plate 72,is from Cape Prince of
Wales, and was collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson. It represents a whale-
line guide, and is used on the bow of an umiak used for whale hunt-
ing. The two pieces of ivory, measuring in height 44 inches, are
ingeniously joined together by mortising, the slot in either piece being
made so as to face its fellow; and into these slots is afterwards placed
a piece to hold both sides in place, by being secured by ivory pegs
which pass through at right angles to the connecting piece, as will be
observed in the illustrations. In the lower cut will be noticed an addi-
tional piece, larger than the round pegs, which consists of a large
glass bead.

The horns of the specimen represent the heads of a mammal, the
eyes consisting of wooden pegs, while the nostrils are drillings filled
in with pegs which appear to have been blackened.

In the upper figure are portrayed two thunderbirds or eagles, each
descending to grasp a whale, the latter having spray in the act of
being ejected from the ‘blowholes.” In the lower figure the birds are
represented as having secured the whales and have risen into the air,
as seems indicated by the form of the whale on the right-hand side.
The engraving of the characters is decidedly bold and expressive, the
entire surface of the etched portions still retaining more or less black
color. The general artistic form of the bird is very like that usually

found in Algonkian pictographs, and does not keep in general har-
mony with Alaskan art, although the whales, which are true, typical,
Alaskan examples, seems at once to repel the suspicion of intrusive
characters, or such as are non-Innuit.

Fig. 136.
MYTHIC SERPENTS.

The four perforations in the piece are for attaching it to the gunwale
of the umiak.

The illustrations given, a, b, and c, of fig. 136, represent mythic
serpents, and are described in some of the folk tales. ¢ very much
resembles the “‘ water monster” of the Ojibwa,
though it is scarcely possible that the cult of
the latter could have been conveyed, even in
the slightest degree, to the Eskimo. Other
intervening tribes, notably so those of the
Athabaseas family, have serpent myths, and
from this people the idea may have been con- ™M®THIC ANIMAL DEVOURING NA-
veyed to the Innuit, especially as the latter ais
are in frequent communication with the Kenai Indians, the northwest:
ernmost tribe of the above-mentioned family.

It has been suggested, too, that the creatures may have been copied
from or suggested by illustrations in newspapers or other literature.

In fig. 137 is shown a mythic creature taking up aman and preparing
to devour him. The belief in water monsters survives among the
natives of the southern coast, opposite the island of Kadiak, a creature

resembling somewhat a reptilian form in imitation of
wn an alligator, of which illustrations are also given else-

Za where.

The outlines in fig. 158 are not sufficiently specific to
Fig. 158. indicate the kind of creature intended, but the indica-

MYTHIC ANIMAL tion of the heart, together with the voice line, or life
line, extending therefrom to the open mouth, is very much like some of
the figures found among the Zuni and the Ojibwa.

This peculiar line denotes the animal to be of a mythic or, perhaps,
sacred character, and has reference to ceremonials known only to the
shamans or members of certain cult societies.

In plate 66, fig. 2, is the engraved figure of a seal, within which are
various objects, animate and inanimate, resembles that class of sacred -
objects often carried by the Ojibwa jes’sakid or juggler.

Fig. 139 represents a series of characters only part of which are
intelligible. No. 1 is evidently—from the curve of the horns—a rein-
deer, while No. 2 is explained to be a mythic animal—a serpent, as
similarly elongated quadrupeds have been interpreted by some natives.
No. 3 appears to be the first of a series of seven figures (Nos. 3, 4, 5,
7, 8, 9, 10) which are apparently decorated with fringed coats, like the
neighboring Kolosh and Kenai Indians, and marks of bird or other
faces upon their heads.

No. 6 is an aquatic bird in flight, which ateonce shows the difference
in execution of ideas, the human figure being bifurcated as above indi-
ecaied. No. 11 is a mammal, resembling the usual character denoting

the putoride.
CEREMONIALS.

Mr. Murdoch remarks that at some of the ceremonial dances of the
Eskimo, at Point Barrow, the participants wear masks, some of which
are sometimes decorated with slight ornamentation.

Fig. 139.

MYTHIC CREATURES.

Gorgets are also worn, and fig. 3 represents an excellent example
with ornamentations relating to fishing and hunting. The same author
remarks, also, that the more southern Eskimo of Alaska are in the
habit of using in their dances very elaborate and highly ornamented
and painted masks, of which the National Museum possesses a very
large collection. The ancient Aleuts also used masks. On the other
hand, no other Eskimo, save ‘ those of Alaska, ever use masks in their
performances, as far as I can learn, with the solitary exception of the
people of Baffin Land, where a mask of the hide of the bearded seal is
worn on certain oceasions. Nordenskidld saw one wooden mask among
the people near the winter quarters of the Vega, but learned that this
had been brought from Bering Strait, and probably from America.”

The dancing mask previously referred to and shown in plate 16 is
from Kuskoquim, and was collected by Mr. E. W. Nelson. The speci-
men is of interest from the fact that it constitutes perhaps the only
example of woodwork bearing pictographs in color. The specimen,
including the lower pendant, measures about 94 inches in length, the
width of the largest piece—bearing the eyes, nose, and mouth—being
almost 3 inches across. Upon the top and right side are a number of
punctures for the insertion of feathers, only three of the latter being
now present. The four slats of wood are attached to the main piece

by means of thin strands of bark. The several pieces were rudely
besmeared with a white chalky paint, while over several portions of
them are markings in black.

Upon the left cheek of the mask are four vertically arranged figures
of masks, rather grotesque in expression. The lower one is not as
elaborately drawn as the others. Upon the upper piece of wood, upon
the left of the mask, is an outline of an umiak, with sail spread. In
the bow of the boat is the figure of a native with hands and arms
uplifted, while another figure is visible in the stem acting as helmsman.

The markings upon the remaining piece are probably meaningless.

Among the Indians of the Northwest Coast, the lakutat and Tshilkat,
and to a certain extent the neighboring tribes, masked dances are of
frequent occurrence, the purport being usually ceremonial; though at
this day much of the former sacredness of these ceremonials has become
debased. Among the Eskimo ceremonial dances are of great impor-
tance, though not of such frequence as among their southern neighbors.

In fig. 140 the vertical strokes shown by Nos. 1 and 10 represent the
timbers supporting the structure within which the dance takes place,
not sufficient space being available upon the specimen of ivory to rep-

Fig. 140.
CEREMONIAL DANCE.

resent the roof. Nos. 2, 7, and 9 are the drummers, each armed with a
flat, tambourine drum, generally used by the shamen everywhere. Nos.
3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 represent the dancers, marked with what appears to be
bear heads—made of some light wood, such as cedar. The attitudes of
the dancers’ are remarkably clever and lifelike, showing the various
attitudes, both natural and assumed, in imitation of the animal repre-
sented, as may be found at any dance of aboriginal peoples when they
attain that particular degree of enthusiasm consequent upon and per-
ceptible to the beholder after a feast.

This engraving, plate 73, fig. 2, is one of the most interesting on
account of the portrayal of the transmission of sound, a stage of devel-
opment found in but few instances in Alaskan pictographs, but of
frequentoccurrence among the Cheyennes, and other neighboring tribes,
in the vicinity of Fort Sill, Indian Territory, and other posts farther
north.

The entire record relates to a ceremonial dance, held on account of a
sick person, and the indication of the village houses and sledges of
visiting natives.

The narrator is indicated at No. 1, his arms outstretched to embrace
the surrounding area as the place where he was, and which, perhaps,
916 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

is his residence also. Nos. 2, 6, and 8 denote scaffolds for food, the
accumulated material being apparent upon the transverse poles. At the
residence at No. 3 smoke is emerging from the smoke hole in the roof,
and someone is also upon the roof of the entrance reaching outward
toward what may have been intended for a scaffold, but which, because
of erosion, had become partly obliterated, as have also portions of the
human beings beneath. The next house, No. 4, also has a column of
smoke rising from the smoke hole, while several vertical lines before
the entrance indicate the original portrayal of the necessary storehouse
or food scaffold. No. 5 is another permanent habitation, while at No.
7, over the roof of the entrancesto the house, is the outline of a man, hor-
izontal and with the hand thrown downward as if making a common
gesture sign for lying down, or to lie there, having reference perhaps to
the recumbent position of the occupant, who may be sick and for whose
benefit the ceremonies are in operation. A heavy column of smoke is
issuing from the chimney.

Upon the house No. 9 are .two persons apparently interested in
something or someone at No. 7, no doubt referring to the sick man.
At No. 10 is designated the entrance to the house No. 9, and upon the
roof are four persons; the one at the right holding in one hand tam-
bourine drum, while with the other hand he is beating it, the sound
therefrom passing forward over the group of dancers before the house.
In the rear of the drummer are three assistant musicians, and from the
absence of drums or rattles they appear to be singers, the belief being
furthermore strengthened from the fact that each of the three has an
arm or hand elevated; the one at the right appearing to place his
hand before his mouth to denote in gesture language speech, voice,
song, a common portrayal in various Indian pictographs, as well as
Maya, Mexican, Egyptian, and Hittite hieroglyphs and objective repre-
sentations of voice in various forms. The remaining figures also appear
to have their hands directed upward before the face, an approach in
gesture to the preceding. The sign for sing, singing, is made by hold-
ing the palm upward and passing the hand upward and forward from
the mouth, though beginning before the neck and passing at from 6 to
10 inches before the mouth.

The narrow vertical line with streamers of cloth or calico attached,
and surmounted by the wooden effigy of a bird, is a votive offering or
“shaman stick” erected upon the roof of the house No. 9 in commemo-
ration of one of the household.

The character at No. 12 is another shaman, armed with a drum, which
he holds in one haad and with the other strikes the head with a drum-
stick, which is seen crossing the surface in the endeavor to drive away
one of the evil spirits or demons hovering about in the air after being
expelled by exorcism from the body of the sick man.

The group embracing nine figures, No. 13, denotes the assistant
Shamans driving about and punishing the evil spirits—the same one

being here reproduced with uplifted hands and once as a small being—
they being masked and decorated with fringed sleeves and garments
and armed with weapons possessing mysterious power in exorcism.
The demon appears in nearly each instance to supplicate the shaman
not to strike with the uplifted rod, the gesture sign for supplication
being accurately portrayed, both hands being elevated toward the one
addressed, not only surpassing in pictorial execution the same idea as
found among other American aborigines, but being exactly similar to
the hieroglyph, for the same idea, of the Egyptians.

Nos. 14, 15, and 16 are sledges, drawn up near to the place of the
dance. The representations of the sledges are more nearly like some
figures of the baidarka shown elsewhere, because of the almost vertical
bow and the dark line along the top, consisting of two horizontal lines
within which are short vertical strokes, the latter denoting bales of
peltries and furs received from other natives for barter. The man at
the fore part of the sledge in No. 14 is smoking a pipe, while the figures
on top of both No. 14 and 15 appear to enjoy the scene, their arms
apparently raised as if in acclamation. At No. 16 the dog is assisted
in pulling the sledge by the man, who is dragging at a cord, the load
being evidently a heavy one, as the man at the side of the sledge is
also tugging at it to assist in propulsion.

The scene presented in plate 73, fig. 1, is of interest, because the
ceremonial dance is performed in the middle of the village, as indicated
by the peculiar distribution of the habitations and the sledges of the
visitors.

The characters in Nos. 1, 2, and 3 denote permanent or winter habi-
tations, upon which are observed some of the witnesses to the dance.
No. 4 is a high pole erected between the habitations, and upon it is an
effigy of an animal, while the pole itself is decorated with streamers of
calico or cloth, flannel, ete. No.5 is a slender stick, upon the top of
which is placed the wooden effigy of a bird, the whole being designated
a “shaman stick” or votive offering, being a token or memorial erected
by a relative or friend to one deceased. The memorial is intended also
as a “luck stick,” i. e., a public testimonial of wishing luck to the
spirit of the dead.

Near the habitation No. 2 is an oblong figure upon stilts, denoting a
seaffold upon which food is stored. These are so erected as to be
beyond the reach of dogs and noxious or predatory animals.

Nos. 6 to 12 are sledges belonging to a party of fur traders who
chanced to stop at the village. At Nos. 6 and 12 the dogs have
already been unhitched and the owners are seated at the front, smok-
ing their pipes. Bales of goods are indicated by the solid outline of
oblong figures raised upon short lines above the sledges themselves.

The human figures represented by Nos. 13 to 22 are the shaman
and his assistants. These are duplicate characters of the latter por-
trayed in driving away evil spirits, Nos. 25 to 26, which are indicated
918 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

as human forms, curved, with the feet and legs turned upward and the
arms thrown forward, as if making violent efforts at jumping. These
spirits are driven around from one point to another, some shamans
driving and striking them to compel their departure, while others are
assisting in exorcism by using the magic rattles, seen as short T-shaped
figures in the hands of some of the assistants.

Allof this ceremony is for the purpose of exorcism, the expulsion of the
demons of disease from the body of a sick man, indicated as wrapped
up at No. 24, where he is supposed to be lying upon the ground.

The entire grouping of the figures is, necessarily, placed along two
base lines, each line running parallel with the border of the ivory bow
upon which the record is portrayed. The heads of the different indi-
viduals, as well as the housetops and the tops of the sledges, are all
directed inward toward the middle, this being the limit of possibility
of artistic execution in attempting a bird’s-eye view of the whole vil-
lage and its dancing ground—the latter being about the high decorated
pole, at No. 4, but for lack of space the ceremonial is transferred to
where it is drawn—the intention being to represent the dancers as if
in a circle, their movements being directed around the pole bearing the
animal figure.

SHAMANISTIC CEREMONIAL.

Two distinet styles of engraving occur in the pictograph represented
in fig. 141, although they are probably by the same artist. The habi-
tations shown in Nos. 1 and 3 are in delicately engraved lines quite
foreign in execution to the crudely carved figures in Nos.4 to 11. The
houses are in profile, and both indicate the place of entrance at the
right side, beneath the delicate vertical rod projecting above. Human
figures are seen upon the roofs, those upon No. 3 appearing to be oecu-
pied in an animated conversation, as suggested by the attitude of the
arms.

The vertical poles, connected by a crosspiece, indicated in No. 2, rep-
resent a rack where fish and the meat of game are suspended for dry-
ing. The figure of a man engaged in some occupation connected with
the rack is observed between the vertical poles.

The human figures indicated in Nos. 4 to 9 are engaged in a dance,
the attitudes of all but two being well executed in the representation of
the peculiar manner of leaning forward the body, common to nearly ail
aboriginal tribes when participating in such pastimes. In Nos. 6 and
8 are seen peculiar tail-like appendages, representing merely ornamental
Streamers often tied to the belt at the spiral portion to represent the

tails of animals which these natives sometimes imitate, both in dress
and actions.

GRAPHIC ARI OF THE ESKIMOS. 3 gag

The two mammalian figures at the extreme right—Nos. 10 and 11—
are dogs, facing one another, an attitude assumed by strangers, as
these had probably accompanied their masters to the place of the
ceremony portrayed.

Plate 73, fig. 4 represents a ceremonial dance. The characters in
Nos. 1 and 4, representing three pairs of human forms, are dancers,
who are aiding the shaman at No. 2, who is shown with his hands
uplifted and throwing them circularly about as if “stirring up a
breeze,” which he is in fact doing, in so far as it pertains to the spirits
of the air, whose aid he is invoking. All this is being done because
the seated figure at the left end of the habitation, No. 3, is requesting
the shaman’s assistance. Four other human figures are indicated about
the same habitation, though partly worn off, and at the right-hand
upper corner is a shaman stick or votive offering, placed there to the
memory of one of the owner’s family. The stick appears to be sur-
mounted by an effigy of a bird, this being the common practice. Nos.
5 and 6 appear to be dancers, each armed with rattles, small round
frames of wood, having both flat sides covered with seal gut or buck-
skin, being used by shamen or their assistants. No. 7 denotes another
habitation, at the left end of which is a votive offering and at the
other a human figure, who, with his left hand, reaches down to another,
No. 8, who appears in the act of winking aid from spirits in the air.

No. 9 is undetermined, but Nos. 10, 11, and 12 are reindeer, the first
and last having attached to them the spirit or guardian of the shaman,
who has compelled the animals to come within reach of the hunter’s
gun, though only one of the three, No. 12, having been secured.

No. 13 represents the shaman in another instance when his services
were requested; this time by a native shown in No. 14, at the left-hand
end and seated or leaning against the dwelling. Some votive offerings
are also perceived upon the roof, while to the right, No. 15, are a num-
ber of natives indulging in a dance, probably a ceremonial one, as the
record is one pertaining to shamanistic matters entirely.

The ivory bag handle shown on plate 32, fig. 7, is an excellent piece
of workmanship, and presents evidence of artistic expression not met
with in any other specimens.

The central disk presents the relief carving of a human face, the nose
being clearly indicated as different from that drawn or engraved upon
the seal’s face, while below the mouth are the vertical lines to denote
the tattooing practiced by the women. The expression of the face is
rather firm and represents a frown. The ring surrounding the face
is the fur hood, the fur itself being indicated by the short radiating
lines extending therefrom.

The opposite side of the specimen is a reproduction of the obverse,
with the exception, however, that the face is that of a man, the mouth
being portrayed by having the corners turned upward to denote a
smile, while below either corner is a circular spot to indicate the
labrets. The furred hood is also shown.
920 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Upon either side of the face are seals, ornamented with rayed cir-
cles, while along the lower edge are two parallel lines bearing interior
decorations of simple cross lines.

The upper edge has a simple longitudinal crease, while beneath this
line is furthermore ornamented by short lateral ones.

INDIVIDUAL SHAMANISM.

The illustration presented in fig. 142 is perhaps unique, the original
having been obtained from a native well versed in shamanism, and in
fact professed to be one.

Descriptions of shamans’ ceremonials in medicine lodges, especially
in the initiation of candidates, were published by the present writer in
the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, and relate
to the Ojibwa Mide’wiwin or
Grand Medicine Society, a cult
society known to the Catholic
Fathers who first came to Can-
ada, but which, until the above
report was published, had
never been thoroughly under-
stood. The complete exposi-
tion of the mythology and
ritual thereto was given by the
present writer; and a similar
contribution to science has
been recently published in the
Fourteenth Annual Report of
the same Bureau, and embraces
the exposition of the ceremoni-
als of the several cult societies
of the Menomini Indians, the
report being a part only of the
memoir which embraces a com-

by Nicollet, in 1634,

The illustration given above, representing an Eskimo shaman heal-
ing a sick man, with the explanation given by the recorder thereof, is
of peculiar value and interest. The Innuit ceremonial structures are
partly underground, the roof being covered with turf and other
materials, and the entrance thereto being by a partly underground or
possibly tunnel-like passage-way.

Plate 64, fig. 1, represents a drill bow from the north of Norton Sound.
Contrary to the usual custom, this specimen is curved edgewise, so that
upon the back appears one continuous record, while upon the front side
there are two, the front being beveled from the central line. Quite a
number of interesting figures appear upon this record, the results in
hunting having apparently been brought about by the kind offices of
a Shaman, to whom application has been made for success by the
recorder or owner. In the small space at the extreme left is the outline
of a human figure, the arms bent and the hands touching the sides,
two prominent ears, and three lines directed upward from the head.
This represents the shaman whose influence had been obtained. Imme-
diately below this human figure is an oblong outline attached to a
delicate groove or line extending forward to a whale. This represents
the float attached to the harpoon line. The next character represents
a seal facing the right, its vis-a-vis being a native crawling along with a
spear in his hand, evidently intending to capture it. The short etchings
projecting from the base line and extending to the right to a distance of
about three inches, represent aimarsh. Five seals are shown about the
middle of this marsh, as if swimming in the water with only the head
and top of the body projecting. Beyond these animals, and at the end
of the marsh, is the outline of a boat. Some distance to the right is a
figure very much resembling a crouching bear. This again is a repro-
duction of the figure of the shaman whose kindly offices had been
secured upon another occasion. He seems to be throwing forward a
magic bullet which, used by the hunter in the kaiak above him, enabled
the hunter to secure the seal he wanted, as shown by the bullet mark
above the animal a short distance in front of the kaiak. Upon the
Same facesof the bow will be observed a number of characters as if
suspended from the upper line thereof. By turning the bow about, the
922 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

pictures will be brought into proper position. Beginning at the left,
are two elongated figures, each upon stilts, which represent the scaf-
folds upon which these boats are placed for drying. Three winter habi-
tations are next in order, about which are a number of human beings
in various attitudes. Smoke issues from the top of the house, and the
vertical rods projecting from the first and second indicate votive offer-
ings. To the right of the third house are three human beings standing
about an umiak, which is drawn foreshortened, and a line extending to
the right to an oblong figure, which is a seal which they have captured.
There are outlines of five natives with arms extended, one with a spear,
but the import of these characters is not intelligible. The next figure,
however, is shown in the act of dragging a seal, while beyond it is
another seal, toward which a native is throwing his spear. Beyond
the latter is shown the body of another seal, toward which a hunter is
crawling on all fours, and in an opposite direction from him is his com-
panion engaged in like pursuit of another seal, shown to the right. As
the bow is shown in the illustration, with the figure of a shaman at the
right, it will be observed that along the upper face are a number of
illustrations which represent various avocations. At the extreme right
is the body of a reindeer lying upon the ground, the horns at the right
projecting upward, and upon the body of the animal, as well as behind
it, are birds feeding upon it. Following this toward the right are four
other animals of like species, with the outlines of a fifth, which can not
be clearly determined. Following the base line for some distance, we
come to another deer in the act of browsing. A little beyond the
middle, toward the right, are three natives, the first going toward the
right with his harpoon directed forward, the second with a line extend-
ing to the right to some object upon the ground, which the third appears
to be stabbing with his spear, the weapon being uplifted. This may
represent the killing of a seal. Another native is seen approaching
this group of three, beyond which is the outline of a large mammal,
evidently intended to represent a deer.

By again turning the bow upside down, so that the upper line becomes
the base line, another record presents itself. The group of figures at
the extreme left denotes two natives occupied in boiling something, as
their hands are attached to short lines extending into the kettles, which
are placed against the fire from which the smoke is rising. It is very
likely that they are cooking the meat of the reindeer, as the hide of
the animal is suspended from the horizontal drying pole or scaffold at
the right, beneath which another native is occupied in hanging up the
meat. The large, irregularly drawn body to the right of this seaffold
appears to denote a habitation. Two human beings are engaged
between this and a triangular body which may denote a summer habi-
tation, the latter being usually made of bark, canvas, or boards. To
the right of the triangular building is a human being, beside him being
another scaffold or drying pole from which is suspended the hide of a

ee

a
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 923

small mammal. Beyond the middle of the bow, toward the right, is a fig-
ure of a kaiak with a native within it paddling forward toward a larger
umiak under sail. In front of this stands a man with a gun uplifted,
as if shooting toward the deer whose feet are attached to the upper
line or base line of the preceding record. Beyond this is the outline of
another umiak under sail, and occupied by
three hunters.

In fig. 143, No. a, is represented a native
who desired the services of a shaman, and,
upon visiting one, declared his needs and
probably paid the fee usually required.

The shaman, making his usual ceremonies
of incantation to invoke his guardian spirit,
or tutelary daimon, is shown with that
creature about to depart on the mission

a, SHAMAN MAKING INCANTATIONS; J,
desired by the shaman. INVOKING AID.

The spirit is a bird, and, as all flying
creatures are deemed lucky, it is here represented in unusually large
size, to increase the importance of the performer.

Another illustration of making incantation is shown in fig. 143), the
shaman expressing his ability to cause fish to come to the hunter by
whom the proper fee is paid. The drawing is taken from an Alaskan
shaman’s drum, but appears to be foreign to pure Eskimo drawing,
having probably originally come from the Thlinkit, or neighboring
tribes of Athabaskan stock.

A remarkably interesting engraving is reproduced in fig. 144. The
profession of the Eskimo shaman is very like that of his confrére of the
Menomini and Ojibwa Indians, of Wisconsin and Minnesota, respee-
tively. He has the power to invoke his personal guardian or tutelary
daimon in aiding him to secure the services of other deities or spirits
to perform certain acts of exorcism, or incantation and invocation, so
that a spirit messenger may be sent on almost any mission for informa-
tion that may be desired; or the guardian spirit or daimon may bring
about some events, or control the actions of both men and animals, as
may be desired.

of some parts of the game secured, has solicited the shaman for “hunt-
ing medicine,” in order that he may secure a whale.

circular line which surrounds them and is planted upon the ground
or base line. The mystic influence has been made to secure a whale,
No. 4, which has been compelled by the shaman’s alleged supernatural
power, in the guise of an anthropoid deity, to swim to the locality
where the ceremonies are performed, in order that the hunter may be
enabled to reach him. The short serrated marking between the whale’s
head and the figure of the spirit denotes the spray spouted from the
whale.

The line connecting the spirit and the shaman’s hand is the indica-
tion of the magic influence possessed by the latter over the spirit
messenger.

Other illustrations of shamanistic power are given, especially exam-
ples of exorcism of demons possessing the sick and to whom illness is
attributed. |

The illustration in fig. 145 is reproduced from a walrus-ivory drill
bow in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company, of San Fran-
cisco, California. The interpretation given to the present writer is as
follows:

Two sick men were brought to the shaman for treatment. The
shaman’s summer habitations are represented in Nos. 1 and 2, the

presence of trees denoting that there was a grove close by. No.3 is the
Shaman, who is represented in the act of holding one of his ‘‘demons”
or personal deities, with whose aid he pretends to expel malignant
spirits or demons from the body of the sick man. No.4 is the demon
under control of the shaman. No.5 represents the same shaman in the
act of exorcising the demon in the patient. Nos. 6 and 7 are the sick
men who are under treatment and from whom the “evil beings” have
been expelled. The two ‘evil beings” or demons are shown in No.
8, represented in violent movement in their endeaycr to escape the
powerful influence of the shaman.

The engraving presented in plate 73, fig. 3, is without doubt one of
the cleverest artistic products thus far received from Alaska and:
known to be the work of a native. The entire grouping of the herd of
reindeer, some of the animals walking leisurely along while others stop
to browse, and while the foremost manifest curiosity and alarm, indi-
cates that the artist was not only a close observer of the habits of the
animal, but had an unusually keen acquaintance with the anatomical
structure and the attitudes assumed under different circumstances so
as to express the emotions.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 925

The hunters, Nos. 18 and 19, had gone to a shaman to seek his aid in
securing luck for game, and the shaman (who is represented by the
upper part of the body only, hands outstretched, above the two rein-
deer, Nos. 11 and 12) being favorably disposed, is driving the game
in the way of the hunters, his assistants, at Nos. 1, 2, and 5, also driv-
ing animals by being portrayed as if riding upon their backs.

No. 4 represents a fawn, the open mouth suggesting its erying to its
parents, while the upper figure at No. 3 and the legless one at the
space between Nos. 7 and 8 are represented as beyond the first file of
animals—an attempt at perspective, no doubt.

The attitudes of Nos. 12 and 16 area good attempt at foreshorten-
ing, rather a difficult undertaking for a native barbarian.

A doe is also shown above the animal at No. 16, walking parallel
with the herd, No. 17, but her legs are supposed to be invisible because
of her being beyond those in the foreground.

The herd at No. 17 is portrayed as an elongated body with numerous
heads and two legs more than necessary for the eight animals indicated.
In nearly all instances the horns are carefully drawn so as to show the
peculiar curve toward the front as well as the so-called snow shovels—
the horns projecting forward and downward over the nose, and by
means of which the animals cut through the snow in search of lichens
and other food.

Nos. 18 and 19 are the hunters with bow and arrow, the attitudes
assumed in shooting being well represented. No. 20 is the hut.

In the accompanying illustrations, plate 74, are three views selected
from a drill bow, in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company
of San Francisco, California. The rod upon which the characters occur
is here presented in three sections, A, B, and C. In A is found the
beginning of the narrative of one who applied to a shaman for suecess
in hunting; which extends only one-half of the length of the rod.
The course of the inscription is then continued on the adjacent side of
the rod at the middle, and reading in both directions (sections B and ©),
toward the two files of approaching animals. Band © occupies the
whole of one side.

The following is the explanation of the characters:

A. No. 1 represents a baidarka, or skin boat, resting on poles; this
is done in order that the vessel may dry. No. 2 is one of the habita-
tions of the village, as are also those in No. 4, and the storehouses in
Nos. 5 and 7. No.3 denotes a tree located in the village. No. 6is a
tree, between the branches of which and the roofs of the houses are
placed poles for drying food—tish, ete. The characters from No. 1 to
No. 7 signify the settlement, the home of the person to whom the
history relates. No. 8 is the hunter sitting on the ground asking for
aid and making the gesture for supplication, asking by elevating both
hands toward the sky, or toward the one from whom aid is solicited.
No. 9 is the shaman to whom application is made by the hunter desiring

926 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

success in the chase. The shaman has finished his incantations, and
while still retaining his left arm in the position for that ceremony holds
the right toward the hunter, giving him the success requested. No. 10
is the shaman’s winter lodge, while Nos. 11 and 18 are trees surrounding
it, as well as the summer habitation noted at No. 12.

In the illustration, B is a record pertaining to the hunter’s previous
application to another shaman with whom no satisfactory arrangement
could be made. Consequently, the shaman caused the game to flee and
get out of the hunter’s way. The detailed description is as follows:

B. No. 14 is a tree standing beside the habitation No. 15, upon which
the shaman is observed standing and driving back the game visible
over the remainder of the scene. No. 16 is a deer, the nearest to and
the first to feel the shaman’s order to return to a safe place. No. 17
are the horns of a deer protruding from the surface of the river which
the animal is swimming. No. 18 is a fawn, recognizable also by the
unusually long legs as compared to the size of the body.

In the last panel, C, is recorded the continuation of the story begun
by the recorder or hunter in A, No. 8.

No. 19 represents a tree located near the hunter’s habitation, which is
shown in No. 20. The hunter, designated in the attitude of shooting,
at No. 21, after having been granted the request for success, placed the
effigy of his totem upon the top of his house as a mark of gratification
and to insure greater luck in his undertaking. Nos. 22 and 23 embrace:
five deer which were secured, the heads of the animals being turned
toward the hunter, denoting that the game was captured. No. 24 is
the shaman’s demon driving the game toward the hunter, while in Nos.
25, 26, 27, and 28 are indicated other demons who were invoked to aid
the chief tutelary guardian of the shaman primarily invoked for this
service.

The figure in No. 25 is a water monster resembling, in this instance,
a whale, but which is represented by other of the Innuit as a four or
six legged serpent. The latter idea is common in the mythology of the
Algonkian tribes; but the existence of such a being in the mythology
of the Aigalu/yamut and Kiate’yamut, Innuit as well perhaps as among
others of this nation, seems entirely original with them.

Plate 64, fig. 2, represents a bone wedge for splitting thin strips of
wood for fish traps. The specimen is from Nunivak Island, and is
remarkable for the curious engraving which is shown to exist upon the
upper surface. It will be observed that the outline within which
almost all the small figures are drawn denotes a seal, a median line
extending from the eye backward almost to the tail. Above and
beneath this are various figures of guns, animals, plants, and straight
lines, while upon the reverse, at a point nearly 2 inches from the
tail, there projects from the median line a many-branched tree, imme-
diately above which and to either side are shown two reindeer as if
browsing. These reindeer present a peculiarity which has been

especially noticeable in Zuni and Algonkian pictography to represent
what is designated as the life line. This consists of a line drawn from
the mouth, or very near it, backward into the body, where it terminates
in a line, or more generally a triangular figure, to denote the head. It
‘is a Shamanistice figure, and indicates that the shaman who possessed
it had influence over the life of the animal so portrayed. This subject
has been more clearly described in connection with the shamanistic
ceremonies of the Ojibwa Indians in the en-
graving of the Mide’wiwin or Grand Medicine
Society of the Ojibwa, published in the Four-
teenth Annual Report of the Bureau of EKth-
nology.

VOTIVE OFFERING.

VOTIVE OFFERINGS AND MORTUARY. ; F

Fig. 146 is copied from a piece of walrus
ivory in the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company, San Fran-
cisco, California, and was interpreted to the present writer in San
Francisco in 1882.

The left-hand figure is a votive offering or ‘‘shaman stick,” com-
monly designated a medicine stick, erected to the memory of one
departed. The “bird” carvings are considered typical of ‘ good

spirits,” and the above was erected by the remorse-

iy stricken individual who had killed'the person shown.
The headless body represents the man who was killed.
In this respect the Ojibwa manner of portraying a man
“killed” or ‘*dead” is similar. Comparison with another
Eskimo drawing, designating a “killed whale” by the
presence in the back of a harpoon, may be made herewith
as another conception of the idea of “dead” or ‘ killed.”
The right-hand figure represents the homicide who
rt erected the ‘‘grave post” or ‘shaman stick.” The arm
is thrust downward toward the earth, to represent the
gesture for kill. This is common, likewise, to the gesture
> i for the same idea as made by the Blackfeet and Dakota

Indians.

In fig. 147 is reproduced an inscription from a grave

distance from home. This also indicates the profession of a skin hunter, -

as the permanent lodges, indicated as winter houses, i. e., With round
or dome-like roof, are located near the seashore, and summer houses
are only needed when at some distance from home, where a considera-
ble length of time is spent in hunting.

The accompanying illustration, fig. 148, is of a similar nature, and is
erected to the memory of a fisherman. .

inscription similar in general character to those in the last two pre-
ceding figures.

The interpretation of the characters is as follows:

Nos. 1, 2,3, and 4 represent various styles of habitations composing
the village. No.5 is an elevated structure used for storing food. No.
6 is a box with wrappings, containing the corpse of a child. Seaffold
burial is frequent among some of the natives. The small lines, with ball
attached, are ornamental appendages, consisting of strips of cloth or
skin, with charms, or sometimes tassels. No.7 is the grave post, bear-
ing rude illustrations of the weapons and utensils used by the deceased

Besides the ornamental appendages, as in No. 6 preceding, there is a
“shaman stick” erected over the box containing the corpse, as a mark
of good wishes.

j CONVENTIONALIZING.

Some examples of decoration are presented herewith, in which there
often appears to be solely an attempt at ornamenting the otherwise
plain surface of ivory. In others there are evidences of an advance
in the graphic representation of objects, in that the originals are no

longer accurately or entirely portrayed, as through an apparent pro-
cess of synecdoche conventions are attained, which are thus employed
for ornamentation, while the original import of the objects themselves
seeris to have been lost sight of,in so far as their use for historic
records are intended. Some miscellaneous examples will suffice to
illustrate these remarks.!

Plate 40, Figs. 5, 6, and 7 are interesting examples of conventional-
izing, and indicate a long stride toward the employment of certain forms
for decorative purposes or for the ornamentation of spaces upon ivory
rods or bows that might not otherwise be apt to be filled with records
of exploits or ceremonials.

The row of thirteen figures in plate 40, fig. 5, are the rear portions of
whales, the attitude sometimes taken by them in plunging, when the
tail emerges from the water to an unusual distance.

The row of fourteen T-shaped characters, fig. 6, are conventionalized
forms to denote the whale, the tail only being drawn to indicate the
entire animal. Similar figures are frequently tattooed upon the body
to denote a successful whaler. Instances are referred to under the cap-
tion Tattooing, p.781. In the row marked fig. 7 are shown fifteen swim-
ming seals, the arrangement being decorative, though, in accordance

with a common custom, they may also have been intended to denote
many seals captured, an indefinite number of objects often signifying
many, and more than the actual number indicated, which may be lim-
ited for want of room.

Other instances of conventional characters of well-known objects are
presented elsewhere.

The regularity with which the seals are portrayed in fig. 150 is
another illustration of recording the successful hunt for these animals,
as well as an attempt at utilizing these figures for decorative purposes.

Other illustrations are given herewith, in which certain animal forms
have become so conventionalized as to be almost unrecognizable, and
in this shape these forms are used secondarily, and perhaps even pri-
marily, as decorations, the designs being artistic, as well as.of historic
interest.

Plate 22, fig. 4, represents a drill bow from Point Barrow. ‘There are
two horizontal median lines, three-sixteenths of an inch apart, extend-
ing from end to end, from which extend toward the outer sides short,
straight incisions, opposite to each of which are the conventional whale
tails. This appears to be strictly decorative, the original import as a
hunting record having apparently been lost sight of in the attempt at
ornamentation. -

Plate 22, fig. 3, represents another specimen of like character from
the same locality as the preceding. It measures 16 inches in length

along the dorsum. Apart from the two perfora-

tions which exist at either end of the bow, there

e } 1 are larger holes made for the insertion of turquoise

are or blue glass beads. On the under surface are

represented skins of a number of animals. The

ten narrow hides at the left are otter skins. The

succeeding five oblong figures with interior cross hatchings are proba-

bly bear hides, The remaining figures to the right, ten in number,

represent the skins of the deer. A very decided attempt is shown in

this illustration at ornamental decoration as well as preserving a hunt-

ing record, as the figures are intended to be represented as nearly alike

as possible, the skin of each species of animal being almost exactly
like others of its species.

One of the drill bows bears a series of illustrations of habitations,
various forms being indicated, so as to readily connect the extremes.
The normal form is shown in fig. 151, while the more conventionalized
outline, which would, if alone, be difficult of specific identification, is
shown in fig. 152.

Plate 40, fig. 7, represents a series of seals, the object of which is
rather in the order of a decoration than as a hunting record. The
carving is deep, and characteristic of the work of the natives from
whom it was obtained at Cape Nome. A like form
of representing seals is shown elsewhere.

The various panels in plate 60, fig. 2, contain seais
at either end, as Nos. 1 and 11, while the bars of ver-
tical lines separate the intervening portion of the
ivory rod into other panels, containing single figures
of trees, in regular order and rather conventional, and in this state
resulting, in reality, in merely a subject of no history, but of decorative
or ornamental import.

At No. 11 a new record was begun; a man is seated, and is appar-
ently preparing some article of diet.

Plate 63, fig 4, represents a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound. The
Specimen measures 184 inches in length, and is decorated upon the
side shown in the illustration by two rows of seals equidistant from
one another and so arranged as to represent a method of ornamenta-
tion rather than a historical record. The great number of seals may

indicate, as in other records, that the hunter was a very successful seal
hunter. Upon the opposite or convex side is a similar portrayal of
animal forms, though in this instance only one continuous row of
spouting whales occupies the base line, while along the upper line but
four of these animals have been drawn, the remaining eight spaces
being blank. One edge of this bow is very crudely but deeply incised
with strange looking figures representing human beings with alligator
heads, armed with mandibles similar to those of huge birds. Several
mammalian forms are also represented, one or two being of mythic
import. Several kaiaks are also shown, the occupants being engaged
in walrus and seal hunting. ©

Plate 21, fig. 1, is the back of the bow drill represented in plate 3,
fig.1. Considerable interest is attached to this specimen from the fact
of the pronounced median lines extending from end to end, the various
objects between these and the outer margin being so arranged as to
form a very symmetrical and decorative figure. This approaches very
nearly one variety of decoration practiced by the Papuans, and referred
to by Mr. Alfred C. Haddon.!

The specimen is inverted and the interpretation begins at the first
figure at the right, which represents a man in a kaiak following four
seals. The two figures extending above and below the median line are
bear skins. The two elongated figures at the narrow portion of the
bow are otter skins. These are succeeded at the next widening of
the bow by the representation of another bear skin, and so on alter-
nately to the extreme right, in addition to the last otter skins there
being still two added because of the narrowness of that portion of
the bow. ‘The space beyond the perforation in the bow at the extreme
right is ornamented aiso,

Plate 24, figs. 5 and 6, represents two ivory bodkins, both from Norton
Sound, where they were obtained from Mr, E.W. Nelson. They are each
about 105 inches in length. The specimen shown in fig. 5 is sharply
pointed at either end and has three decorated sides. On the plate the
illustration is inverted so that the triangles with projecting lines which
represent summer habitations are misleading. In this instance the
figure of the summer habitation has been adopted as a means of deco-
ration only and has no special import. Upon the next side, the edge
of which is partly visible, are the figures of eight walruses, also placed
upon the utensil simply as a means of decoration. Upon each of the
three sides appears a deeply creased base line, and at intervals of
about one inch are oblique lines one-eighth of an inch in length placed
almost together, closely resembling one of the forms utilized to denote
or indicate the “ Finback” whale. The signification of these charac-
ters, however, can not be determined. They are believed to represent
decorative marks only.

Plate 24, fig. 6, represents a bodkin, only one end of which is sharp-

ened, the other end terminating in a seal head. The four sides of the
specimen are decorated, the first, shown in the illustration, bearing six
figures composed of the rear halves of whales joined together so as to
present flukes symmetrically at eitherend. On the second side are out-
lines of seven triangular summer habitations, on the right-hand slope
of which are two projecting lines, similar almost to the lines in the pre-
ceding figure representing swumer habitations. On the third side are
engraved figures of seven wolves, while upon the fourth side is a single
horizontal line with other oblique lines extending therefrom at inter-
vals of about an inch, similar to the groups of threes in the preceding
figure.

Plate 21, fig. 5, represents a drill bow from Kotzebue Sound, measur-
ing 172 inches in length. It is made of yellowish and old looking
ivory, the dorsum being round while the under surface has two divided
faces. The animals represented upon these are wolves, and are evi-
dently arranged in such manner as to present a pictorial result rather
than a hunting record. It is possible that the hunter may have been a
wolf hunter and intended in this manner to illustrate his great success,
as a great number frequently indicates an indefinite number—that is, a
larger number gathered during a lifetime than could conveniently be

portrayed on so small a surface. A similar idea obtains in gesture
language, in which the native will pass his hands upward and outward
as if outlining a heap of some soft material, this gesture signifying
large or many; au indefinite number signifying a great many, in con-
tradistinction to a limited number which would be indicated by ges-
tures of an entirely different form.

The specimen shown in plate 37, fig. 6, is part of a drill bow which
is nearly 25 inches in length. Upon one surface the utensil is deco-
rated with figures of seventeen reindeer and nine bear skins, rather
decorative than as a hunting record, while upon that side visible in the
illustration thirty-seven skins of the seal are drawn, the interior of
these objects being decorated with short lines extending from the outer
line inward toward the middle of the body, while the median line
extending through the middle of the hide is similarly etched toward
the outer side, leaving the two white spaces as a series of zigzags.

Plate 59, fig. 1, represents a drill bow from Nubriakh, collected by
Mr. E. W. Nelson. The characters represent bearskins, and are placed
almost at equal distances from one another across the entire length of

the specimen, to represent ornamentation rather than a record of
exploits.

The nine crude outlines shown in fig. 153 represent that number of
bears killed during the lifetime of the owner of the record.

The skins are here suspended from upright poles or posts, and the
arrangement of figures has, in other instances, suggested patterns for
decorative purposes, as will be observed elsewhere in connection with
the subject pertaining thereto.

Figs. 7 and 8 of plate 50 are spear guards usually attached to the
upper surface of the canoe so as to form a secure guard upon which
the spearis placed. Both of these guards are decorated with concentric
rings, both different. Upon the outer line in fig. 7 we perceive diverg-
ing short lines terminating in the conventional V-shape or tree figure,
while in the other, fig. 8, will be perceived the plain line, which may
perhaps refer to the flower symbol noted in fig. 4 of plate 50, and
described elsewhere in Mr. Turner’s communication. See also plate 75
bearing various forms of native patterns of circles.

Plate 38 represents four ivory bag handles, of which fig. 1 is from
Norton Sound. It bears upon the upper side four sets of concentric
circles, equidistant from one another, and connected by a median line,
above and below which are a pair of radiating diagonal lines appar-
ently denoting the conventional symbol of whale fins. This specimen
is similarly marked upon the bottom side and convex edge. With ref-
erence to this ornamentation, it is one step beyond that represented in
plate 29, fig. 2, which was obtained at St. Michaels, and upon one side
of which are shown five sets of concentric circles similarly connected
by median lines, but without the lateral radiating lines above noticed.

On plate 38, fig. 3, is shown another bag handle upon which appear
seven sets of concentric circles, which, however, are smaller than those
shown on the two preceding specimens, plate 38, figs. 1, 2. The design
shown in fig. 3 appears to be the primary mode of decoration, as in
this there are no connecting lines.

Plate 48 represents a variety of ear pendants from several localities
on the west coast of Alaska. The chief feature of these specimens
consists in the variety of ornamentation. Simple dots made by drill-
ing, concentric rings, nucleated circles, and in one specimen—fig. 8—a
series of serrations attached to two of the circles, comprise the chief
features of ornamentation. Fig. 9, however, represents a powder
charger consisting of a bell-shaped implement, hollow beneath, with
just sufficient cavity to contain one charge of powder. The nucleated
circles upon this specimen are among the smallest thus far found in
the collections of the National Museum. The arrangement of the cir-
cles, also, is artistic and geometrical. Those attached to lines extend-
ing from the ring, and apparently suspended therefrom, are, without
doubt, flower symbols, as midway between the circle and the upper
ring are short lines denoting leaves. This is probably the blossom or
fruit of the cranberry— Vaccinium Vitis-idea.

Around the lower border of the utensil is a delicately incised line,
934 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

small nucleated ‘circles alternating with vertical lines terminating
above in a similar small nucleated circle, from which diverge two short
lines, which in turn end in similar rings. The entire outline of the
pharacter is that of the simpler form of the tree symbol, though it is
believed to denote the fruit of the arctic plant known as the Vacciniwn.
This belief is strengthened by the occurrence of similar characters
known to denote this plant, and from which a native carrying a bucket
or kantag is shown asin the act of plucking fruit. Compare fig. 70, p. 863,

Above these characters are a series of larger nucleated rings, each
with three radiating lines, which are without doubt intended to repre-
sent the flowers of this same plant. That the circle with such exter-
nal ornamental appendages is intended to represent flowers has been
explained in Mr. Turner’s communication above noted.

The circles portrayed upon this specimen are the most delicate found
upon any of the specimens in the National Museum. They are appar-
ently the work of an expert workman, and made with comparatively
delicate instruments.

The arrangement of nucleated rings in the form of a triangle and
connected by short lines, as in the fruit or plant character above noted,
appears upon some Thlinkit bone ornaments shown in plate 9, fig. 3.
The transmission of the character, or its suggestion, appears to have
come from the Innuit, the southern tribes being known to make this
pattern, and the intertribal relations with their eastern and southern
neighbors is constant. Being a shaman’s ornament among the Thlinkit
would suggest the idea that the original signification of the character
was unknown to them.

Plate 68, fig. 6, represents a very beautiful rod of ivory from Kotzebue
Sound. It is perforated at one end like a bag handle, but sharpened
at the other in imitation of a bodkin. Three sides are decorated. The
peculiarity of the ornamentation is the insertion in the blank spaces of
nucleated rings, their association with these hunting expeditions being
very much in imitation of the characters upon the petroglyphs at
Bohusliin, in Sweden, and shown in plates 75, 76, and others of like
character, showing simple nuclei or pits, as well as nucleated circles
attached to lines to represent human beings, exactly like some found
in the Shoshonean area of southern Nevada and in the Moki country.
The illustration in plate 75 represents at the extreme left four vertical
lines, with the zigzag and toothed pattern found upon other objects,
which has been designated as the fish trap or seal tooth pattern. The
next figure, a crescent, and is a symbolical whale tail. The two bars
leaning toward one another, between the whale tail and the walrus,
are the rude outlines of the sides of a habitation, the delicate ‘ndieneen
of the occupants within being shown. The remaining figures, as will
be observed, consist of a kaiak and several whales and walruses. The
groups upon the other sides of this rod are very much in imitation of
the preceding.

Other interesting and similar illustrations of nucleated rings, in con-
nection with lines to denote human beings, are given by Hans Hilde-
brand,! as also concentric circles and simple nuclei in the same work, _
page 381. These illustrations are of petroglyphs, and it is evident that
in the first named instance the nucleated ring is the head of an oarsman,
or perhaps one in authority, as most of the designations for the rowers
are alike in length and form, whereas the nucleated figures are always
nearer one end of the vessel.

Plate 31, fig. 3, bears upon one side a median incision, upon the upper
sides of which are represented a series of conventionalized trees. Upon
the reverse are similar tree patterns, but drawn at oblique angles, all
leaning toward the left.

Jn the figure of a ship’s anchor chain the links are indicated. by draw-
ing the chain zigzag. This is found to occur in only one instance, as
shown on plate 40, fig. 2.

Other interesting examples of conventionalizing are shown in the
distinction between the portrayal of an ice floe, being a simple curved
line as in No. 5 of fig. 112, to denote transparency of substance, while
the walrus upon it is incised and the surface blackened.

A similar view of walrus upon rocks is shown in fig. 3 on plate 70,
the rocks being outlined somewhat after the order of a floe, though, to
show the solid and creased sides of the dark material, the pictograph
is incised with the zigzag-like pattern, frequently illustrated in orna-
mental borders as the fish-trap pattern.

Plate 38, fig. 4, shows a bag handle from Point Hope. The outer
edges are scalloped, a small circular excision appearing at the points
where these scallops should terminate, each of these excisions being
furthermore ornamented by a circular line which surrounds it and from
which radiate shorter lines at right angles like the rays of the sun.
In the middle of the handle, extending from end to end, is a high,
rounded ridge, at each side of which is a median line; on the sides
facing the circular excisions are two short lines directed outward, while
midway between these points are two shorter lines directed inward
toward one another.

Plate 78 represents part of a page from a whaleman’s log book, being
a journal of the bark Peri, Captain E. Russell, who sailed Friday, June
29, 1854, from New Bedford, Mass., for the Indian Ocean, on a sperm-
whaling voyage, and returned May 26, 1857. As will be observed by
reference to the illustrations, the note under date of Tuesday, Decem-
ber 11, 1855, is as follows:

extreme left is an inscription, “16th time of seeing them,” denoting
that it was the sixteenth time that whales had been sighted. The
letters at the tail end of the whales, W B, S B, and L B, denote waist
boat, starboard boat, and larboard boat, two whales being captured by
the first and second, while three were taken by the last named. At
the right of the whales are the numbers of barrels of oil furnished by
each, as well as the total, amounting to 146. The method of stamping
these outlines is by means of small wooden blocks, which are dipped in
ink or other coloring matter, for the reason that the picture of the
whale is so readily perceived, obviating the necessity of searching over
each page to find any special reference thereto in the manuscript text.

On plate 79 is represented another part of the same log book, and
under date of Monday, July 21, 1856, are two references, the first, “29
time of seeing,” and another ‘30th time,” referring to the characters
of whale’s flukes or tails standing upright, and denoting in this con-
nection that the whales were sighted but not captured.

On plate 80 are represented five specimens of Eskimo carvings which
are of interest in this connection.

In fig. 1 is shown a very short kantag, or perhaps bag handle, from
Sledge Island, the original measuring but about 23 inches in length,
while the perforations along the top ridge separate the pieces of ivory
into a series of connected flukes. These are better illustrated on fig.
3, a specimen from Cape Darby, in which the whale tails are almost
separated from one another, slightly bent to one side, and very natural
in general outline.

In fig. 4 is shown another neat specimen from Sledge Island, while in
fig. 2 we have one made of a piece of hollow ivory or bone, in which
both ridges are rudely perforated so as to simulate whale tails, as in.
the preceding illustrations. These four specimens are of interest, from
the fact that the flukes are utilized in the decoration or ornamentation
of utensils, and probably at the same time denoting that the owner
was a whale hunter or had been successful in catching whales. The
most interesting specimen in the series, however, is that given in fig. 5,
which represents a kantag handle from Point Hope. This specimen,
in addition to having the carving of a whale fluke at the upper edge,
has neatly engraved upon one side four flukes, flanked on either side
by a bowhead whale facing inward. The six figures are arranged
artistically and symmetrically, and are almost exactly of the same
class of ornamentation as in plate 80.

The question would naturally arise whether the Eskimo had copied
such methods of portrayal from the whalers, or the whalers from the
Eskimo, or whether the art evolved independently among both.

In consultation with Captain E. P. Herendeen, now of Washington,
District of Columbia, a gentleman who has spent many years in the
Aretie regions, [ am informed by him that he made his first whaling
voyage toward Point Barrow in the year 1854. At that time he found

in possession of the natives of Point Barrow innumerable specimens
of ivory upon which were engraved similar outlines of flukes and
whales, both of which had reference to whaling expeditions. Captain
Herendeen believes also that the Innuit practiced this method of
indicating a whale, by simply portraying its tail, prior to the voyages
to that part of the Arctic ocean of the whalers. This is a question
that can not now be satisfactorily determined when we come to remem-
ber the early arrival in that part of the Arctic regions of the Russians
and people of other nationalties, all of whom came for purposes of
exploration and probably traffic. The practice of portraying but part
of an animal for the whole, known as syuecdoche, is very common
among some of our native Indian tribes, and it seems to have resulted
chiefly, perhaps, as labor saving, and also perhaps because many of
the natives may have had occasion to portray certain animals by only
the most conspicuous parts to represent the whole, as the observer
would readily understand the intention of the artist. Such a process
of pictography is particularly prevalent among the Dakota and other
of the Plains Indians, especially in connec-
tion with the indication of proper names, in
which the human head is drawn with a by <2
short line, issuing from the mouth and run-
ning upward from the head, connecting
thereby the object or animal which suggests
the name of the person; and in which the line denotes speech, in imi-
tation of the common gesture sign made by passing the finger forward
from the mouth, denoting “That is it,” instead of simply passing the
finger forward to denote speech generically; the latter would be indi-
cated in pictographs only by a short straight line, extending forward
and perhaps slightly curved, but not attached to any object.
Incomparison with the preceding remarks concerning theconventional
fluke, the accompanying designs on fig. 154 are reproduced from a
Specimen from Cape Nome. The forms are diverse, yet both are aceu-
rate in suggesting the original which furnished the concept.

Such T-shaped figures, denoting flukes, are tattooed upon the body
to signify that the person so decorated is a successful whaler. Reference
to several localities where the natives practice this method of personal
adornment, to indicate also individual achievement, will be found under
the caption of Tattooing, p. 781.

Plate 14, fig. 3, represents a kantag or bucket handle from Norton
Sound. Upon this specimen is engraved a wolf, to the right of which
are two grazing reindeer, while the fourth and fifth characters repre-
sent hides or skins of bear placed in an upright position so as to
almost resemble the tree symbol. To the right of this is’a habitation
with smoke rising from the smoke hole, and a native approaching the
entrance. Along the upper margin of this specimen are two seals at
the left, and a whale’s fluke, indicating that a whale was seen by the

natives in the boat to the right.. This portrayal of the whale’s fluke,
although utilized as a simple ornament or decorative design in many
instances, is here portrayed in imitation of the system adopted by the
New England whalers, as represented in plate 80. ats

Plate 68, fig. 1, is a drill bow from Cape Nome, 153 inches In Jength
and 2 of an inch square. Upon the side shown in the illustration are
a series of semicircles, with tooth-like attachments on the upper sur-
face, the interior being filled in with vertical lines. Between each of
these semicircles is a cross-like figure denoting a bird. The semicircles
themselves are conventional characters to represent whales.

At the extreme right is the outline of a reindeer facing toward a
native, who has his arms in the attitude as if holding a bow, part of
the character being obliterated. Upon the opposite side of this bow
are 2 number of curious looking objects somewhat resembling the gen-
eral outline of a whale with a peculiar mandible-like attachment extend-
ing upward and forward from the head, while to the back are attached
short, inclined lines almost resembling harpoons. The fact that these
short lines are placed in position by pairs indicates that they denote
legs, the mandible being in reality the mouth of the mythic creature
which it represents lying upon its back with the feet uppermost. At
the extreme right of this record are three small creatures of the same
species, though not as carefully represented as the preceding ones.

Upon the top of the bow the left and middle portion is occupied by
reindeer, and a habitation, near to which is a meat rack and human
figures with arms outstretched. At the right of the record is a very
delicately engraved picture of a village with six habitations.

The bottom of the bow is ornamented by a continuous line of nuele-
ated rings of several sizes, the central perforations in nearly every
instance being unusually deep, while the rings themselves surround-
ing the perforations are generally deeper on one side as if the instru-
ment with which they were made had not been held directly at right
angles with the surface operated upon.

COMPARISON.

Plate 81 represents a ‘‘ History of a Year of the Chukeh.” It is repro-
duced from a lithographic print by Doctor Carlos Bovallius, and is in
imitation of the original, drawn on walrus skin, and it is alleged to
have been the work of some Chukche natives. It isnot known whether
Doctor Bovallius has published a history in detail of this pietographie
record, but attention was called to the record by Doctor Walter Hough
of the National Museum, who received the above information, in turn,
from Doctor Bovallius, to the effect that the record refers to the avoca-
tions and hunts of one entire year.

The preceding paragraph was written one year ago and the interpre-
tation given at that time, and in connection therewith, was based upon
the application of Eskimo pictographs of known signification, and
upon information possessed relative to such interpretation in general.

OF THE CHUKCH.”?
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 939

Having within the past few days had opportunity, and occasion, to
further examine the literature bearing upon the Swedish Polar Expe-
ditions, I learn that this plate forms one of the illustrations given by
Mr. Hans Hildebrand in his monograph on primitive art, and forming
a chapter in one of Baron Nordenskiéld’s works.' In speaking of the
generally intelligible state of the pictographic characters, he remarks
as follows:

‘Teh will es allerdings nicht auf mich nehmen, von allen diesen Bil-
dern eine befriedigende Erkliirung zu geben, die Hauptziige sind jedoch
so deutlich, das sie nicht misverstanden werden Kénnen. Nahe den
Contouren der Haut laufen auf beinahe allen seiten breite Linien,
welche an mehreren Stellen zu breiten Flecken aufschuellen. Diese
Linien stellen den Strand dar, die Flecken sind zuweilen Hohen, zuweilen
Zelte, die letzen theils an den regelmassigen Konischen Formen, theils
an den tiber die Zeltspitze hinausgehenden inden der das Gerippe des
Zeltes bildenden Stangen erkennbar—diese Kleinen hervorstehenden
Enden finden sich auch auf den modernen Abbildungen der Tchukt-
schen-Dorfer.”

The following interpretation is given as viewed from the Eskimo
standpoint, as the entire collection of figures of animals, whales, ships,
human beings, and every other character is typically Eskimo, and the
system of recording, as well as the type of characters themselves, was
undoubtedly obtained from the Eskimo by copying other like records
of ivory obtained from the natives of the American coast, or possibly
from the Yuit, who are near neighbors of the Chukche, and who are,
furthermore, the Asiatic representatives of the Eskimo, Neither is it
known that the Chukche were at all proficient, originally, in recording
pictorially their records, literature being generally silent on that sub-
ject, and nothing appears in the collections of the National Museum
that bears any relation to ornamentation of any character whatever
and marked as of Chukche origin.

Believing therefore that the record under discussion is Eskimo, the
interpretation is given from the standpoint of our knowledge of Indian
characters. The presence of the two disks, Nos. 1 and 2, denote the
sun, No. 1 being in Indian pictography a black sun, or night, while No.
2 represents the summer sun as it usually appears a little above the
northern horizon. These two scenes therefore would confirm the state-
ment given by Doctor Bovallius as covering the period of one year.
About the outer margin of this record, and marked by indentations
and irregularities, appears the shore line, upon the outer margin of
which toward the border of the record are various scenes depicted as
occurring upon a solid surface, while within the line generally are
various scenes, aS whale hunting, ete. The outlines of habitations are
also scattered at intervals, as in Nos. 3 and 4, apparently in the midst

1884. Pls. and ill, This work was reprinted in Leipzig, 1885, under the title of

940 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

of the water, but this results, no doubt, from the fact that large blank
spaces had been left after the aquatic scenes were completed, and the
habitations were then placed upon the most available space. In No.3
will be observed a vertical pole with cords stretched out to various
sides of the pole, while beneath are represented four human beings.
The import of this is not clear, but in fig. 4 we have the outline of an
underground habitation very similar to many of those represented on
the ivory rods. Over the entrance is placed a votive offering, shown
by a vertical line with a short cross line attached to the top, beneath
which is a human being with arms extended from the head as if reach-
ing to something above him. Upon the dome-shaped portion of the
habitation are three human beings, one crawling by the side, while
two are engaged in peeping down through the smoke hole to see what
is going on within. On the inside are three natives, one on the floor,
while the second is seated on the bench or projecting boards placed
around the interior, which also serve as beds, while the third appears
to be hanging by his feet from a horizontal bar. Whether this is sim-
ply an acrobatic feat or not, we have no means of determining. At No.
5 is another object in the shape of a parallelogram within which two
human-like objects are seated, facing in opposite directions. These
characters are very similar to the Shoshonian pictographs as found
among the cliff remains of northwestern Arizona. The hands of one
of these characters are elevated, with the fingers outspread, as if
making gestures, while the other has his hands placed toward the
ground, with fingers spread. It is probable that this represents some
shamanistic idea.

Among the various representations of umiaks are some very interest-
ing ones, those in Nos. 6, 7, and 8 being particularly well drawn. At
No. 9 is one which very much resembles the petroglyphs, or the petro-
graphic representation of boats as found in Sweden, of which an illus-
tration is given in plate 76, A fine illustration of harpooning is shown
in No. 10, the floats being attached to the line, while the animal is
shown as attempting to escape, at the same time blowing water above
his head. <A similar exploit is shown in No. 11, the harpoon having
been cast and the whale followed by the umiak represented in No. 12.
In No. 15 is shown an umiak, from which a harpoon is being thrown at
a seal, while the native in the stern is elevating his paddle in imitation
of the signal to denote concentration. This is a notice to the aeccom-
panying kaiaks that the harpoon has been cast and that the assisting
hunters are to surround the animal struck.

In No. 14 we have the interesting illustration of a whale being
harpooned, the float appearing behind, while a second harpoon has
been thrown into him, the line of which is still attached to an umiak,
which in turn is connected by a continuous line to a second umiak,
both boat loads of hunters in this wise keeping up with their foray.
In No. 15 a whale is likewise shown with two harpoons and floating
lines attached.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 941

Upon the opposite side of the illustration is seen a pregnant whale
(fig. 16), the body of the larger animal being lifted partly, while within
is portrayed a smaller whale with the head directed toward the head
of its parent. A little to the left of this are some well-drawn illustra-
tions of sledges, to which three dogs are hitched, No. 17, while around to
the left are the outlines of several natives holding their arms aloft as if
experiencing surprise or joy at something in which they are interested.
At No. 138 is shown an indentation representing a little inlet in which
a whaler is shown anchored. Near the vessel are natives in various
attitudes, as if engaged in conversation or barter, while above, in No,
19, are four small triangular bodies projecting toward the water, which
denote habitations, very much in form like the ordinary Indian tent.

At No. 20 is the outline of a large bear being attacked by twa
natives, the one in front pretending to strike him with some large
object, while the man behind him is in the attitude of using a spear.
Quite a settlement is represented at a projecting point of land, No, 21,
the lines upon which are continuous dark bodies, both round and tri-
angular, representing habitations of various kinds.

In No. 22 are represented six small scaffolds, and from the opposite
side of this point are three others which may represent burial scaffolds,
or they may possibly be intended for food storage only. At No. 23 is
the shore line, the short projecting lines radiating therefrom appar-
ently denoting sedges or grass, while the lines extending around the
village appear to denote a rise in the land corresponding to the con-
tour lines. In No, 24 is shown an individual upon a loft, with arms
outstretched, as if making signals. In No. 25 two habitations are
shown, with another scaftold denoting the end of the settlement. The
inclosure between Nos. 24 and 25, within which are vast numbers of
short lines, seems to denote a marsh with sedges, or reeds, or other
aquatic plants, while in No, 26 we have a continuous line of blackened
spots denoting the contour of a mountain range upon which we find at
several points human beings, one with a spear, while another has his
arms outstretched as if attracting attention. Beyond this range are
indicated various animals, conspicuous amongst them being the deer.
This apparently denotes a hunting ground. At No. 27 is another inlet
in which are represented three whalers or whaling ships, while upon
the shore we find two pairs of human beings in which one person of
each pair seems to hand forward some object to the other, who is
shown with outstretched arms as if to receive it. About the ships are
shown numbers of umiaks loaded with natives who have come to trade.
In No. 28 is another indication of a bear hunt, three natives partici-
pating in this attack, two armed with bows and arrows, while the third
has only a spear. In No. 29 is shown what appears to be a hostile
encounter between several natives, and actual hostility is taking place
as shown in No. 30, where two are engaged in grappling with one
another, while their companions stand by in various attitudes of sur-
prise or alarm,
942 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Along the shore line indicated at No. 31 are numbers of habitations
and scaffolds, as observed elsewhere, while at No. 32 are a series of
black projections which evidently denote hills, as these are also shown
at No. 26. The native shown in No. 33 appears to have shot an arrow
into some animal, while the native in front of the latter is in the atti-
tude of thrusting his spear. Absence of horns seems to indicate a doe,
or possibly a bear, although the length of the limbs would preclude the
latter idea. At No. 34, however, the figure of a bear is drawn more
carefully. In No. 35 is shown a herd of reindeer, while in No. 36 is
shown another whaling ship, beneath which are four kaiaks loaded
with individuals who have come after trade. A curious illustration is
that shown in No. 37, in which quite a string of reindeer are attached
to sledges. The native in No. 38 is apparently driving back the ani-
mals who are heading off in that direction. In No. 39 is the outline of
a habitation with the accompanying horizontal rack, from which meat
or other food is shown suspended. The character in No, 40 is, without
doubt, the outline of a net, and resembles in almost every respect sim-
ilar ones found in the pictographs made by the natives of the American
coast. In No. 41 is a horizontal line with five animal heads protruding.
These would seem to denote walruses, but from the fact of the projec-
tions above the head they are probably intended for deer who have
broken through the ice, or may be swimming, toward which the umiaks
are hastening, as Shown above. No. 42 represents a number of individ-
uals with arms extended and hands directed toward the ground, which
resemble very much some of the characters on the drill bow (plate 68,
fig. 3.

Since the above interpretation was dictated, I have had the oppor-
tunity to consult Captain E. P. Herendeen, a gentleman thoroughly
familiar with the country and the natives of both sides of Bering
Strait. Upon submitting to him the chart for his examination as to
the geographic location referred to, the following additional informa-
tion was obtained, as well as his approval in the belief that the coast
natives {Kskimo]| were more likely the authors of the record than the
“ Deermen” |Chuckche|.

That part of the record marked No. 40 comprises the coast of the
Holy Cross Gulf; and extending backward to No. 18, which denotes
Plover Bay, are observed. whales and a whaling ship, denoting a com-
mon occurrence in past years for whalers to enter one of the numerous
inlets, seek a good anchorage, and there make the required catches
instead of sailing in the open sea. Whalers are said to have been
common at almost every favorable point.

The point of land at No, 19 is East Head, and is precipitous, while a
small village is located near the entrance, of which my informant could
not give me the native name. Opposite the hull of the vessel is a long,
narrow black line, which represents a sharp spit of land actually oceur-
ring at that point in Plover Bay.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 943

At No. 25 is a point of land which is recognized as Indian Point.
The shore has a rocky appearance, and immediately back from the
surf line appear some contour lines, upon which are the representation
of scaffolds, as before noted, which Captain Herendeen says are caches
of the natives, while the houses are scattered along in rows. The
irregular area between the village and the ridge of hills at No. 26 isa
marsh. The hills are also in actual existence and beyond them is a good
hunting ground, as indicated by the artist.

To the right of Indian Point, in the midst of an inlet at No. 43, is
Arakan Island, formed like a hump, with a straight line on one side to
denote the water line. The line at No. 44 covers an inhabited stretch of
land, commonly called the Michigme, and located on a bay of the same
name. Several habitations are visible, and a number of human forms
are drawn near to them.

At the right-hand end of the Michigme settlement is an inlet show-
ing three whales, near each of which is a pair of human beings, one
person in the act of handing to the other some object, the import being
trade, the purpose of the visit of the natives.

The lower or opposite shore, marked Nos. 350, 31, 34, and 36, Captain
Herendeen is not positive whether it may represent a continuation of
the Asiatic shore or St. Lawrence Island, the locality where the Asiatic
coast natives obtain oil and various articles with which their country
is not well stocked, returning therefor wooden vessels, poles for tents,
frames for boats, ete., which are primarily obtained from the Chuckche,
as the latter come from the inland regions by means of sledges, as shown
at No. 17.

From the general appearance of the drawings, the continuity of shore
lines, with the exception of a small and apparently insignificant break
at No. 45, would indicate that the Asiatic side alone was intended
to be shown, and not the opposite American shore. The statement,
too, that the record is a “year’s record” should also be taken into
consideration.

At No. 46 is an indentation probably intended to represent St. Law-
rence Bay. There is quite a herd of seals indicated, clearly denoting
the presence there in great numbers of that animal. Habitations of
various kinds line the shore line, to indicate a settlement of natives. At
No. 47 is shown a harpooned walrus, followed by a native in a kaiak,
who has his arm raised as if about to cast a’ second weapon. No. 48
has already been alluded to as a marsh, the short lines being indica-
tive of the sedges growing at that locality. No. 49 is a skin tent, near
which is lying upon the ground what appears to be intended for a
sledge. The latter is in imitation of the Chuckche type, as may be
observed by comparing those at the opposite side of the chart in con-
nection with the sledges to which reindeer are hitched, near No. 39.

The general resemblance of these teams of the Chukche is, in gen-
eral, very much like those of the Samoyeds, and I can not refrain from

introducing herewith as plate $2! an illustration published by Mr.
Jackson in his work on “The Great Frozen Land,” which illustration
is a reproduction from a photograph. The middle, covered sledge, is
one used by women, the remaining one being for goods and men.

No. 50 denotes a village, the tent poles protruding from the tops of
theledges. Along the shore are more habitations, and two umiaks filled
with hunters are shown in the water. At No. 51 are two natives
making an attack upon a bear. One of the hunters has a spear, while
the other is armed with bow and arrow. A third hunter, alittle to the
right, has shot his arrow into the animal, and has extended his open
hand outward, to indicate to the others that he has “cast a weapon,”
in imitation of the custom of whalers when they elevate the paddle,
or spread hands, to inform their companions of their action and to
request concentration of boats to secure the game.

At No. 52isagroup of six men. Two are going forward with a spear,
while the two in the middle are making gestures. The pair at the right
are in close embrace, apparently in combat. No. 53 illustrates the
method of spearing seal through the ice, very similar to that shown at
No. 31. The small ring, however, denotes the breathing hole made by
the seal, this being absent in the latter instance. Nos. 54, 55, and 56
are obscene figures, and not worthy of reproduction.

Various illustrations of Chuckche ert are given by Mr. Hans Hilde-
brand,’ and in every instance the products resemble the figures on
plate 10, and appear as if they had been drawn with a pencil or
sharply-pointed brush. The general type of the portrayals are like those
of the Eskimo, clearly showing artistic relationship. In the same con-
nection are Shown, also, a series of line drawings, reproductions from
drill-bows from Port Clarence, some of them being so like those in the
collection of the National Museum as to lead me to bel eve that the
originals used by Mr. Hildebrand and by me were the same, or that
they were made from copies or duplicates by the same Alaskan artist.

Ou plate 9 are represented six pieces of decorated bone slabs
obtained from the southeastern neighbors of the Eskimo—the Thlinkit
Indians. The specimens are selected at random from a necklace bear-
ing a total of fifteen. They were the property of a shaman and formed
part of his decorations, but whether they were believed to possess
mystic or other virtue is not known.

The interest connected with this lot consists in the decorations upon
the pieces of smooth bone. The ornamentation is typical of the
Eskimo, as may be perceived by reference to numerous illustrations
submitted herewith, and was apparently adopted in imitation of sim-
ilar designs observed in the possession of Eskimo shamans, or such as
may have been introduced through the medium of intertribal traffic.
The trade route along the northwest coast has before been referred to
as one of the most ee culture routes of pee Pate of the Ameri-

can continent, but with an almost total absence of evidence to the con-
trary, the direction of the movement of culture and art designs has
been in the opposite direction to that illustrated by the present
instance. In other words, the Haida and other influences have been
pushing steadily northward and westward amongst and beyond the
territory of the Thlinkit, and not from the latter areas eastward and
southward.

By reference to the illustrations in the plate, it will be observed that
the concentric circles, apparently made in the same manner on all the
pieces where present, were made by pieces of metal filed to a V-shaped
form, one apex or side being left a little longer, perhaps, than the other,
so as to more easily serve as the center pivot. The rings are of differ-
ent width from the outer, showing that they were not made by an
instrument with movable arms, in imitation of a pair of dividers. Fur-
thermore, the diameters are not exactly of the regulation size, as would
be found in a common manufactured bit, but the outer rings are less
than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, being almost seven-thirty-
seconds—an unusual size. The inner circles are scant three-sixteenths
of an inch in diameter, clearly indicating that the tools were of aborig-
inal workmanship, though made of imported metals as well as
imported instruments.

The arrangement of circles as in fig. 5, plate 9, is also in imitation of
Aleutian and other Eskimo patterns, and foreign to the ornamentation of
the Thlinkit, as far, at least, as illustrated in the products of that tribe
now in the collection of the National Museum. Reference has already
been made to a like arrangement of circles on some of the ancient
British coins, referred to at page 819, and a closely resembling example
of which is shown in plate 47, fig. 1.

The strong resemblance between some of the carvings of the Eskimo
and those of the cave dwellers of the Dordogne has been referred to
by various authors.

Mr. Edward T. Stevens remarks that “It is singular that, except at
La Madelaine, none of the bones appear to have been gnawed by
beasts of prey.” The cave people are believed, therefore, to have
occupied the caves permanently or to have closed them when deserted,
and to have excluded carnivorous animals which might otherwise have
been attracted by the accumulation of bones.

Doctor A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological and Anthropo-
logical Museum in Dresden, has recently published some magnificent
folio volumes on the ethnographic materials from various localities—
from the Philippines, New Guinea, etc.—and in Volume Ix of the series
presents some illustrations of combs bearing decorations, which would
at a cursory glance suggest the type from which the Eskimo orna-
mentation was obtained for the comb shown in plate 32, fig. 4. The
several specimens of workmanship of the Nigritos above mentioned
may be found by reference to Doctor Meyer's plate 2, figs. 1, 2, and 3.

NAT MUS 95——60

946 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895

Plate 65, fig. 4, is a thread case of reindeer horn, marked as from
“Ooglaamie.” This is interesting, because of the peculiar portraiture
of reindeer horns, in which these projections are exceedingly tall and
straight, as compared with the art work of other localities. The most
interesting figure connected with this is the representation of a kaiak,
immediately above which are two nucleated rings, exactly like those
shown in the petroglyphs from Sweden.

Plate 7, fig. 1, represents an arrow straightener made of reindeer
antler. The specimen measures 63 inches in length, and is surmounted
by the outlines of a reindeer’s head, the small knobs only indicating
the rudimentary horns. The eyes are made by the insertion in small
perforations of three glass beads. The nostrils and mouth, as well as
the ears and the external meatus, are all very true to nature.

An incised line extends along the spine from the occiput to within an
inch of the rear end, and two incised lines, one on either side of the
neck, run parallel therewith.

This specimen is very interesting as comparing very favorably with
some of the specimens figured by Messrs. Lartet and Christy,! which
are found in the cases of Dordogne.

An exceedingly interesting arrow straightener of walrus ivory is
shown on the same plate, fig. 2. The reindeer, which is portrayed in
outline, has the head thrown forward as in rapid running. The legs
are gathered up close to the body; the ears are indicated by mere
perforations, while the eyes were originally inlaid, one still retaining a
plug of dark wood. The perforation in the body—for the insertion of
spear or arrow points—was made by sawing the spaces between the
perforations made by drilling, the saw marks yet remaining where the
angles were formed.

The perforations in the arrow straighteners in the Museum collection
are all at an angle of about 20° to 40°, so as to permit the inserted
piece to extend backward toward the longest projection of the straight-
ener, in order that a sort of V shape is formed, the two ends being thus
more readily grasped by the one hand, so as to produce stronger and
more steady pressure than if both hands were used.

A number of deeply incised and uncolored figures of reindeer are
engraved over the body of the utensil, and but a single character
differing therefrom appears to be that of a shaman, shown near the
point of the perforation, his two arms being extended and his head
decorated with horn-like projections, as if the result of a ceremonial
mask.

The third specimen (fig. 3 on plate 7) also represents an arrow
Straightener, the head end of which ends in the outline of the fore
quarters of a bear. The eyes are made of two blue beads inserted in
perforations, and the teeth are indicated by incisions with the graver.
The fore legs are made to extend downward over the front of the per-

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 947

foration so as to give additional strength to that part. The specimen
is slightly decorated on one side with the outline of a human being
with arms extended, a line extending from the head along the middle
toward the perforation; on one side is the drawing of a wolf, while
beneath it is a flintlock gun. Upon the other side is the representa-
tion of a reindeer, with two smaller animal forms incised, while beneath
the former is the rude portrayal of another flintlock gun, the flint being
indicated by an unusually strong line projecting from the raised hammer.

The general outline of these animal forms appears at a first and
careless glance to be very like the examples figured by Messrs. Lartet
and Christy, but upon close inspection the difference between the sev-
eral types becomes more and more apparent. As before intimated,
if the cave dwellers of France were in such an intellectual status as is
usually claimed, the artistic work as evidenced in their etchings on
horn appears vastly superior to that of many peoples far in advance in
civilization.

Further discussion on this subject is not deemed appropriate in this
connection, but will be renewed in a paper the purport of which is
intended to be an examination of the relative merits of the art work
of primitive peoples.

Similarities of design with divers significations, and dissimilar pat-
terns with like purport, occur in all parts of the habitable globe, and,
as before intimated, the concept giving origin to such designs should in
all instances, where practicable, be sought for among the peoples who
are the authors thereof. In like manner, it is of the highest importance
to obtain the native artists’ interpretation of any obscure or conven-
tionalized characters, as such are often apparently intelligible from
their resemblance to characters of known signification, whereas the
result of inquiry may sometimes be rather startling, if not open to the
suspicion that the uncultured artist is himself unconsciously in error.

APPENDIX.

The following list of gesture signs were collected during the summer
of 1882 in San Francisco, California, where an intelligent Kadiak half-
caste was met with under circumstances which enabled him to devote his
exclusive attention to the subject of the transmission of thought with-
out the use of oral speech. This person was the offspring of a Russian
father and a Kadiak mother, and during his youth had almost con-
stantly accompanied his father in trading and collecting peltries for
the Russian Fur Company. After the transfer to the United States of
Alaska, this man, Vladimir Naomoff, continued in the service of the
Alaska Commercial Company, of San Francisco, California, visiting the
various settlements of natives on the mainland and inland to the Cop-
per River Indians [Kutchin or Kenai], a tribe of the Athabaskan lin-
guistic family. In this manner Naomoff became thoroughly familiar
not only with Russian, English, and the Kadiak dialect, but with half
948 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

a dozen or more other native dialects, which enabled him to observe
and acquire the various resources which many of the natives, meeting
as strangers, would be compelled to employ to enable them to commu-
nicate in ordinary contact, and also in the representation of graphic
methods whereby to communicate to owners of houses of a visit and

the import thereof.

The collection of gestures was made, together with many others, from
most of the Indian tribes west of the Mississippi River, and deposited
in the library of the Bureau of Ethnology, through the courtesy of
which I am enabled to give them publicity in this connection.

the arms at the elbows, and throw ihe flat right hand horizontally forward as high
as the shoulder, and when nearly at arm’s length pass it downward in a curve, and
straight backward on a level with the hip and to that point. As the right hand is
moved back, the left is thrown similarly forward. Both are repeatedly moved to
represent crawling over the surface.

the head to indicate man; this gesture is then followed by mustache. Conception:
The beard and mustache upon the tall man belonging to the speaker.

FATHER’S SISTER.

Make the sign for father, as before, and his, by throwing the thumb only extended
outward a little to the right; then for young woman, which is indicated by stroking
the side of the head, downward, as to denote long hair, and then pinching the lobe
of the ear to designate earrings.

Figur, To.

Close the hands, leaving the extended thumbs lying along over the flex forefingers ;

then pass both hands in irregular movements, forward, downward, and backward
again, quickly, as if boxing.

the thumb against the index as if grasping some object which had been given.
GIVE, TO, TO ANOTHER. (Granting a request. )

Place the tips of the fingers against the edge of the thumb, thus closing the hand
naturally, and pass'it from near the side of the breast in a curve outward and down-

Goop.

Place the hands with the paim downward before their respective sides of the
breast and as high as the shoulders, the fingers naturally separated, extended, and
slightly curved; then pass them rapidly and alternately toward the top of the breast,
at the same time assuming a pleased countenance with the brows arched.

GRASS.

Place the backs of the hands near the earth, the fingers separated and curved
upward; then, as the hands are thrust up and down quickly, they also move from
side to side or place to place. Conceptions: Sprouting, short vegetation, and the area
thus covered.

GRAVE, CHILD’S.

(1) Place the flat hands edgewise before the body as high as the shoulders, then
pass them downward toward the ground fora distance of about 15 inches; then place
the right hand edgewise at arm’s length before the breast, pointing toward the left,
the left between it and the breast, edgewise and pointing toward the right, then
pass both downward as far as before; (2) then hold the separated and extended
index and second fingers of the right hand before the face and push it upward a

though elevated index from the front and right to before the breast; then pass the
right flat hand horizontally forward under the left palm also, to indicate entering the
Lodge.

Indicate a large horizontal circle with both hands from nearly at arm’s length
backward toward the body; then make the sign for man (mustache), and move the
body up and down and place the hands to the front and sides as if dancing around
the circle just indicated.

Hor (weather).

Pass the slightly bent hands, palms downward, from before the cheeks, upward
and outward as far as the top of the head. At the same time expel the breath

time make a slight inclination forward of the head.
KatAk (Baidarka).

Place the closed hands on a level with and about 15 inches before their respective
shoulders, palm or sides to the front. Then pass the left fist downward, backward,
and outward toward the left, and in a curve continue upward, forward, and back to
point of starting, i. e., the right follows the motion of the left, maintaining its dis-
tance as in commencement. When the left turns up and back on its course, the
right begins a similar gesture on its side. ‘‘ Represents the manner of using the
double-blade oar (or paddle) of the coast natives.”

KiLu, To. KILLED.

Place the right forearm horizontally forward from the elbow, flat hand, palm
downward; the left flat hand pointing upward and forward from the left side; then,
as the right hand is rotated outward and the back down, throw the left palm
straight across and downward over the right forearm.

KILL, To (with a gun).

Point the left forefinger forward at arm’s length, the index pointing in the same
direction from the right eye; then make the sign for to kill, killed.
KiL1, To (with a knife).

Make a forward and downward thrust with the fist, outer edge down, then con-
clude instantly with the sign for fo kill.
Kit1, To (with a knife).

Thrust the right closed hand edgewise downward and toward the front, quickly,
coming to an abrupt termination when about as low down as the height of the
waist.

KILL, To (with an arrow).

Simulate shooting with an arrow; then make the sign to kill.
LAND OTTER.

The flat hand edgewise (or the extended index) in a curve to the front—as for
whale, in direction though not so high—and give several quick whistles as if eall-
ing pigeons.

Liz. (Falsehood.)

Make the sign for talk; then throw the hands outward and forward, palms down
and slightly curved, at the same time puffing with the mouth—bad.
LopGE (Indian).

Place the inner surfaces of the tips of the extended fingers of both hands together,
the wrists being only an inch or two apart.

Similar to a common Indian gesture.

LopGE (white man’s).

1. Lay the edge of the extended index across the extended forefinger, the first

joints touching.

2. In addition to the preceding, extend the left thumb and place on the extended
index.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 953

3. With the index and second fingers of both hands extended, place them together
so that they cross about the first joints, the right index above.
MAN.

1. Pretend to catch the ends of the mustache with the hands and twist them out-
ward from the face to right and left.

2. Pull the fingers and thumbs over the sides of the upper lip as if twisting and
pulling outward a long mustache, then throw the right hand, palm forward, before
the right shoulder, pointing upward.

MAN (old).

Place the finger tips of the slightly curved hands together before the chin, though
about 6 inches from it, palms toward the jaw, then pass them upward toward their
respective sides of the head; then imitate walking with a staff, by passing the
closed fist edgewise forward and downward in a circle several times.

MANY.

Slap the palms quickly toward one another before the breast, fingers pointing
upward and naturally extended and separated. Refers to ‘‘many-times counted-
fingers.”

Moon.

Close the eyes while indicating a circle with the hands above and in front of the
head; then pass the flat hand, edgewise, out toward the front and right from the
center of the breast.

MOTHER.

Close the hands, incline the head forward, then pass the hands upward frem the
back of the head, forward, and downward toward the forehead, the motion corre-
sponding to the curve of the head, but the hands about 35 or 4 inches from it.

MOTHER.

Make the sign for woman, and to be born.
MOTHER’S BROTHER.

Make the sign mother [i. e. women, to be born, and mine], then for tall, by indicating
height with the flat hand palm down; man, by elevating the hand, and that for
mustache.

MOTHER’S SISTER.

Make the signs for mother [woman, to be born, and mine] and young woman ; conclude
by throwing the fist with the thumb extended in a pointed manner a little to the
right, indicating hers.

MUSKRAT.

Curve the left fingers and thumb and bring the tips almost to a point, leaving a
slight opening, palm down, and horizontal, finger tips pointing toward the right;
then bring the extended index pointing from the left side directly toward the left,
in an upward curve first, then downward and forward into the opening left at the tip
of the left.

NIGHT.

Incline the head toward the breast with the eyes closed, and place the flat and
slightly bent hands with the palms down before the brows, the finger tips almost
touching.

No.

Place the curved hands edgewise with the backs forward, the fingers tonching
and pointing toward the breast, then throw them outward toward their respective
sides a short distance, though rather smartly.

Novuine. (Have nothing.)

Throw the extended hands horizontally forward and outward toward their respec-

tive sides from a position before the breast.
OCEAN.
Make the sign for big, broad, and that for kaiak—indicating double-bladed paddle.
954 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

PEOPLE.
Move the elevated index with the palmed surface forward, from side to side, before
the face. ‘‘Men at various places.”

The index is an abbreviation of the general sign for man, and this was the only
instance in which it was used.
PORCUPINE.

With the palms directed toward and near the ground, imitate slow walking by
moving them alternately forward and backward; stoop over to the front, throw the
separated fingers backward toward the hip, then throw the extended index violently
outward and backward.

‘“‘Imitates slow movement of the animal, the spiny covering, and the direction
of the spines thrown from the tail.”

PORPOISE.

Place the right hand in the same position as for whale, make the motion to the
front less in extent, and accompany with a whistling sound from the left corner of
the mouth, resembling the sound piu.

RAIN.

Place the flat hands on a level with the face, palms down, fingers pendent, and
move the hands alternately up and down, blowing gently with the mouth at the
same time.

RIVER.

Make the sign as for creek, the hands being held much farther apart, then pass the
right hand edgewise forward to arm’s length, in a serpentine manner.

‘‘Course and width of water containing fish.”

SEA OTTER.

Flex both hands, place the outer edges together just before the neck, palms toward
the face, throw the head back, open the mouth to full extent and imitate the gut-
tural sound of X or ch twice or three times, at the same time making a downward
pull with the hands.

SETTLEMENT.

Indicate a large circle, horizontally, by passing the hands in semicircle, right and
left, from nearly at arm’s length backward to the breast; then place the tips of the
fingers of both hands together, leaving the hands and forearms leaning outward
and downward to their respective sides, the distance between the elbows being about
24 inches.

The large-sized roof house indicates plurality in this instance.

SHAMAN (complete sign).

Make the sign for grass, herbs, then pull it from the ground by grasping forward
with one hand, closing it and pulling it toward the body; then the sign for to boil,
add the sign for give, and for drink, and conclude with that for man—mustache.

across the breast with the hand over the left breast, and lay the left hand across
below the right, so that the left hand touches the right forearm near the elbow,
“internal suffering.”

Cuts and fractures are indicated pantomimically, after which the above sign is
made, to illustrate specifically the nature of the sickness.

SPECIMENS REFERRED TO IN PRESENT PAPER.

The specimens selected from the collections of the National Museum,
upon which to base the present paper, are enumerated below, and in
all instances, where possible, the National Museum Catalogue number
is attached, as well as the nature of the specimen, the locality from
which obtained, and the name of the collector. Other information of
interest as to the character of the etchings engraved therein is also
added in a few examples.

The list is divided into two general classes, the former embracing
the drill bows, bag handles, and other long rods; while the second
comprises all other inscribed pieces, such as utensils, weapons, orna-
ments, toys, and other undetermined specimens.

The leading word refers to the article under consideration, which is
followed by the locality where it was obtained. The name of the col-
lector is next given, which, in turn, is followed by the numbers under
which it is placed in the accession list of the National Museum.

The entire series of numbers, from first to last, is in order so as to
facilitate identification by that means as well as the kind of object
referred to.

The list forms but a small part of the collections from Alaska, but is
sufficiently comprehensive for the present paper.

ahut. The opposite side has four vessels, one with natives, and a man near a
walrus, behind a wolf, next a reindeer, and before this another wolf and a goose.
The oblique figures at the end are ornamental.
GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 959

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. L. M. Turner. 24536. Bears upon one side the figure
of a stern wheel steamboat, an illustration of which is given in fig. 31. Upon
the reverse a few reindeer, fox, wolf, a two-masted schooner, and a three-deck
kaiak, above the latter an outline of the human figure with arms partly
extended, as in gesture for surprise. The upper edge or rim has some decora-
tion consisting of rude short lines arranged diagonally, though crossing at right
angles to one another.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. L. M. Turner. 24537. An old bow, having on one side
a number of seals, divided into two divisions by eight upright whale flukes.

and arrows, and with spear. A bear also is shown, while on the reverse is a
herd of reindeer being hunted.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. L. M. Turner. 24543. But one side and the bottom
edge are decorated. The side bears a hunting record, three human figures, at the
middle, being interested in the result of shooting at some reindeer and other
animals. At the left end is a kaiak, the occupant of which is after a large bird
and two walrus. Upon the bottom edge are four hunters, each in his kaiak, after
four whales, three of which have been harpooned. The hunters are represented
as holding their paddles horizontally above the head, the gesture or signal that
they have cast the spear or harpoon, and also to indicate ‘assistance wanted ”
in so far that the animal may be kept sight of and not permitted to escape.

DRILL Bow. St. Michaels. L. M. Turner. 24545. This bears some of the best
incised of the ordinary art work of this locality.

record of a man smoking while one hands an arrow to the third who is shooting
a reindeer. Other animals are also portrayed farther to the right. Dog sledge
and native, as well as houses, are shown on next side, while upon the third
face are two longitudinal border lines with interior crosspieces of ornamenta-
tion, denoting the wavy o1 zigzag pattern. See also figures and accompanying
references passim.

DriLt Bow. St. Michaels. L. M. Turner. 24556. Piece of four panels, two of
which have umiaks with hunters. Opposite side has zigzag patterns by pairs,
both inclosed between the usual parallel lateral lines.

DRILL BOW. St. Michaels. L. M. Turner. 24557. Made of reindeer horn; is orna-
mented on one side with deeply cut and uncolored outlines of birds, wolves, deer,
men, and mythic animals, several appearing like alligators.

DRILL Bow. Sledge Island. (?) 28021. Although so marked, the record in acces-
sion catalogue is not in accord and the collector’s name not given, which, without
doubt, should be Mr. Nelson’s.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33179. Bears on the convex surface
some dancers. At the other end is a well-drawn umiak, from which an animal
is running. The lateral edges are ornamented with deeply incised blackened

boxing or sparring.
960 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33181. The bow is curved edgewise,
plain, with the exception of a heavily incised crease at the base of either side.
One of these creases shows evidences of repeated scratchings with a finely
pointed tool.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. E.W.Nelson. 33182. A yellowish, rather old, speci-
men with various figures, nearly all of which are characteristic.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33183. A four-sided round-edged piece
of old ivory, 13} inches in length, upon one side of which only a simpie figure
occurs—that of a man with his arms curved and hands resting on his hips.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33184. This bears marginal lines
extending from end to end, at one end being a kaiak with a single hunter, while
at the other are four inverted umiaks; apparently not a finished drawing.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 33188. Made of reindeer horn, and is
rather thin and deeply creased on either edge by one groove, and by two grooves
upon the upper and under sides. The lower side bears sharply incised engrav-
ings of reindeer hunting; the herd of animals is lying down, while the hunter
is crawling up on all fours, being hidden by a hillock.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E.W. Nelson. 33189. A bow made of reindeer horn
and bears sharply defined characters of boats, sledges, meat racks, etc.

Dritt Bow. Norton Sound. E.W.Nelson. 33190. Bears upon convex side a herd
of reindeer, with one hunter at the right end of the rod.

BaG HANDLE. Kogik. E. W. Nelson. 36375.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 37178. A triangular bow, with figures
of conventional seals along the lower side; conventional T-shaped whale flukes
along a horizontal line upon the one side of the upper surface, while on the
other side are the conventional rear ends of whales, with the flukes projecting.

KANTAG HANDLE. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 37742. Plate 14, fig. 3.

Dritt Bow. Shaktolik. E.W.Nelson. 38521. Bears upon one side nineteen rein-
deer, no doubt purely for decorative purpose. Upon the opposite side are also
twelve reindeer, though heading in the opposite direction. These, too, are all
alike, or nearly so, and appear to be intended rather for decorating the bow than
as a record only.

DRILL Bow. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 38522. Hunter partly obliterated, but
to his right are five whale flukes setting on end T-shaped and indicating that
number of whales captured. The opposite side—the bow being made to stand
edgewise—bears a reindeer which is being shot at by a hunter. The latter is
lying flat and aiming with a gun. At the other end are three granaries.

BaG HANDLE. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 38523. Six inches in length and rather
stout. It is yellow with age, and bears upon the upper side one base line, to
which are attached eight figures of concentric circles with deep central pits.

DRILL Bow. Northof Norton Sound. E.W.Nelson. 38781. Both upper and lower
sides decorated with nucleated rings, the central perforations or incisions being
rather deep. The circles measure three-eighths and five-sixteenths of an inch in
diameter, arranged without any special care or purpose, simply following the
general horizontal direction of the faces. One edge has whale flukes and the
other triangular summer habitations in regular order and apparently for dec-
orative purposes only.

DRILL Bow. Port Clarence. T. H. Bean. 40054. This bow bears hunters spearing
seals through the ice, some of which are illustrated elsewhere. Upon the other
side are several figures of mythic animals. Upon one edge is a village of tri-
angular-shaped dwellings, with meat rack in middle.

GRAPHIC ART OF THE ESKIMOS. 961

Dritt Bow. Shaktolik. E. W. Nelson. 43810. Delicate and beautiful engraving
marks this as very superior to most specimens. The reindeer is shown on one
side; delicately engraved umiaks and a kaiak are on the next adjoining side,
while on the reverse are partly obliterated characters, shown and described in
text in figures.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44206. Much curved and old specimen.
The length straight across from point to point is 14 inches, while the height of
the curve is 4 inches. Both sides are decorated, the narrow edges having only
parallel lines, excepting one place ornamented with an umiak containing three
persons ‘The upper side bears a variety of delicately engraved figures, occupied
with various avocations, and many of them represented in attitudes to denote
action and gesture. The under side bears a herd of reindeer, the animals, after
passing through a slough or river, approaching a hunter who is armed. Beyond
this person is another engaged in cutting up a reindeer which is lying upon its
back. At the right side are four other reindeer in various lifelike attitudes.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44207. Bears a few coarsely engraved
characters, at one end being the upper line of a whale’s figure, to which are
attached lines like fins or spines from the head down toward and nearly touch-
ing the flukes.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44208. Walrus hunting and scaffolded
umiaks are shown on one of the two lower surfaces, the upper flat surface being
without any engravings. The work is very graphic, and some of the boats in
the water are scattered, to resemble the work of Japanese artists—as pertains to
an attempt at perspective in this instance. The specimen is shown as a text
figure.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44209. Plate 24, fig. 1.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44210. Records on two sides consist
almost entirely of reindeer in various attitudes, and some very lifelike. A few
animals are drawn foreshortened.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E.W.Nelson. 44212. Old yellow ivory specimen, deco-
rated on four faces. The dorsal surface has two figures incised to the depth of
over one-sixteenth of an inch, the figures consisting of rudely drawn animals
and human beings.

At the side is a series of outlines of the human figure, with arms in various
attitudes, as in records portraying ceremonial dances, though in the present
instance the figures appear seated upon the ground, or base line. Boats and
walruses are also to be seen nearer the right end, while at the left is a seal hunt.

Upon the opposite side are several umiaks, going toward the right, in pursuit
of a whale. In the middle of the record are some indefinite outlines, among
which, however, may be detected that of a reindeer.

The under side bears upon it a number of animal forms at the left, while a
well-drawn whale is next portrayed, followed by another, whose body is thrown
partly from the water, having been harpooned by a hunter in the pursuing umiak
at the right. A whale fluke projects from the water behind the boat, while two
cubs and an adult bear are next shown, approaching three large figures, which
seem to be intended for heavily robed or dressed natives.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E. W. Nelson. 44213. Upon the dorsum of this piece
is a group of ships and native boats. Rude engravings of ships occur on one
side, while white men’s houses are represented at other portions.

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44366. Delicate and sharp engraving
marks this specimen as characteristic of this locality.

The herd of deer shown in fig. 9 are from this piece.

962 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44367. Represents a walrus hunt and
harpoon throwing. Illustrations have been selected from this rod and repro-
duced in connection with hunting and fishing.

BAG HANDLE.. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44398. This fine large specimen has
numerous figures of flying birds and human forms resembling the Ojibwa
thunder bird. Whale and other hunts are also portrayed.

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson, 44399. A strong piece measuring 174
inches in length. The two flat sides and one lateral edge have been decorated.

BAG HANDLE. Cape Nome. [E. W. Nelson. ?] 44427. Bears crude though typical
characters of umiak, +--like bird figures, and several human figures. The speci-
men is yellow and considerably worn. :

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44400. A narrow specimen, measuring
134 inches in length, five-sixteenths of an inch high, and one-fourth of an inch
thick. The engravings represent walrus hunting, and two of the kaiaks are
unusually interesting, the spear rack or guard being indicated in the first kaiak,
while on the second the harpoon line is shown with the twists and curves observ-
able when a coiled line is cast out.

Dritt Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44401. Plate [23], tig. 1.

DRILL Bow. CapeNome. (E.W.Nelson.?) 41464. Interesting from the fact that
both slopes of the under surface bear rows of umiaks, some with meats and some
without, so placed as to suggest ornamentation rather than an attempt to record
historic or other information.

Upon the upper side the entire length is also divided by a median line. Upon
either side the space is filled with various figures, such as camp scenes, dances,
and various avocations.

The specimen is rather yellow with age, and the figures partly filled with a
brownish black substance.

Dritt Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44465. A yellow, old, piece of ivory,
with a sharp4tined series of small figures at the end upon the upper edge of
the bow. There are five swimming seals, rather conventional in outline, above
which three birds are seen in the forms of small cross-like characters. Before
these is a figure resembling a bear(?) and still farther forward a seal.

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 44416. Plate 24, fig. 4.

DriLt Bow. Cape Nome. (E.W.Turner.) 44467. The herd of deer upon the upper
curve of this specimen is shown as a text figure. The lower side, and the edges
also, bear camp scenes, while various human figures in attitudes of gesture are
shown on the side.

placed alternately facing, between parallel longitudinal lines.

KANTAG HANDLE. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 44717.

DRILL Bow. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 45016. Parts of this are reproduced
in text figure. The lines are sharp and cleanly incised. One pecularity in the
figures of human beings on records from Sledge Island is that the heads are all,
or nearly all, made by boring with drill. One side of another face bears an
umiak with harpooned whale, following a neatly engraved white umiak con-
taining 3 figures.

The under side bears some obscene figures, or rather those made obscene by
gesture and additional drawings.

DriLt Bow. Sledge Island. E.W.Nelson. 45017. The figures of a series of hab-
itations, boats on racks, and umiaks afloat, are all neatly and definitely incised.
Upon the reverse is a settlement of two winter habitations and one scaffold,
the five human figures being portrayed with hands and arms elevated, slightly
inclined toward the left end of the bow, seemingly as if some further portion of
a record had been contemplated but not executed. The color employed in fill-
ing the incision is black, and the entire specimen, and engravings, has a modern
appearance.

DRILL Bow. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson (?). 45019. The decorations on this
interesting specimen are reproduced in text figure. The work is characteristic,
the dancers only resembling the deeply engraved figures usually found on the
specimens from Kotzebue Sound.

DRILL BOW. Sledge Island. E. W. Nelson. 45020. This old specimen presents a
whaling fleet. Upon the reverse is a group of natives fishing through the ice,
near by being their residence, granary, and votive offerings stuck up upon the
entrance to the house.

DriLt Bow. Sledge Island. E.W. Nelson. 45025. Upper side slightly rounded,
while the bottom is divided in two sides or faces. All these are decorated with
sharp, fine lines, characteristic of Cape Nome workmanship. The specimen is
very yellow and has an old appearance, chiefly because of the signs of long-
continued use.

DRILL BOW. Cape Nome. E.W. Nelson. 45330.

DRILL Bow. Cape Nome. E.W. Nelson. 45331. An old piece of ivory with char-
acteristic engravings. The type is recognized, if any special difference may be
said to exist between this and other localities, by the thin, though sharply
incised, lines and brown-black color applied to bring out the cavities. A great
deal of gesticulation is always represented in connection with the portrayal of
the human figure.

One of the two upper faces has upon it a herd of reindeer, the other face a seal
hunt, while the bottom has the drawings of buildings and storehouses for food.

DRILL BOW. Cape Nome. E.W. Nelson. 45332. A triangular slightly curved bow,
174 inches in length. The specimen is yellow from age and bears the delicate
hair-like incisions or engravings characteristic of the locality from which it
came. Gestures are frequently indicated, though the chief features of the bow
refer to reindeer and walrus hunting. At one end is a dance, the performers
being drawn in various attitudes.

On the under side are the fine lines portraying two kaiaks approaching one
another, the occupants holding aloft their paddles, while between them are two
seals. A little farther toward one side is an umiak with five occupants, whose
heads and faces resemble birds’ heads with long sharp bills.

DRILL BOW. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 45333.

DRILL BOW. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 45345. Bears herds of reindeer, some
browsing, while others are in various attitudes upon the ground. The under
side bears a herd of reindeer approaching a hunter. At the right end are two
bears, apparently a mother with its cub.

Dritt Bow. Cape Nome. E.W. Nelson. 45346. Some of these etchings embody
gesture signs, and are reproduced in connection with that subject.

DRILL BOW. Port Clarence. W.H. Dall. 46056. Made of a rib, is almost 12 inches
across from tip to tip, and retains a thong of leather for drilling purposes.
There are no decorations of any description.

DRILL Bow. Fort Anderson. KR. MacFarlane. A rounded bow 114 inches long,
resembling the preceding in smoothness and absence of decoration.

DRILL Bow. Golovin Bay. E. W. Nelson. 48080. <A specimen yellow with age.
No decorations appear with the exception of two parallel lines on both the upper
and lower surfaces. The handle has been much worn by long-continued use.

DRILL BOW. Cape Darby. E.W.Nelson. 48115. An old-looking yellow specimen,
upon which is the whale being dragged from the water and cut up, shown in
plate 67, fig. 3.

The opposite side has the ceremonial dance, and drummer from whose instru-
ment the sound is represented as going out over the group of dancers. Plate
72, fig. 2. ;

DRILL Bow. Kotzebue Sound. E.W. Nelson. 48518. A dark yellow specimen,
crudely and heavily engraved with ship, walrus, ete. A good harpoon line and
effect of cast is shown.

Dritt Bow. Cape Nome. E. W. Nelson. 48330. Bears solid herd of reindeer
nearly 3 inches long, while on other side are reindeer, and men making gestures.

DRILL BOW. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48519. An old and very yellow
specimen of ivory. Four sides of the piece are decorated with several distinct
stvles of records. The upper or convex side bears the deeply engraved figures
of whaling ships foreshortened, and habitations, probably indicating some
trader’s establishment. On one side is a native, drawn lengthwise, next to him
being portrayed a rack with meat (fish) suspended, while next to this is a net
stretched out for drying.

The next characters resemble the curved parallel lines used by the Pueblo
tribes and the Ojibwa to denote the sky, beneath which are parallel vertical
lines running down to the base or ground line, resembling the symbol for rain.
The present figures are believed, however, to dencte the aurora borealis, a like
figure having been drawn for the present writer by Naomoff and verified by a
Malamut Eskimo in California at the same time when the investigations were
made at the museum of the Alaska Commercial Company.

A very rudely drawn figure of a winter habitation, with smoke issuing from
the top, is shown next toward the right, the end of the rod bearing smaller fig-
ures of food rack, huts, etc.

The under side of the rod bears, at the left, two dog sledges being dragged
forward, and preceded by nine natives running toward a large winter habita-
tion. These natives are in various attitudes to represent locomotion, and each
has a projection upon the head, as if ornamented with a plume, though it may
represent the top of the furred hood.

The engraving is generally deep, and characteristic of the locality from whence
it was obtained.

DRILL BOW. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48522. A dark yellow specimen,
apparently very old, and engraved on three sides. Figs. — are from this piece.
All the engravings are deeply cut and blackened. One side bears 15 seals, 14 of
which are being dragged, the entire series resembling an attempt at decorative
results rather than historic.

DRILL Bow. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48524.

DRILL Bow. Norton Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48525. This bow is tinged with age,
and is of a decided orange along one side. Parts of the engravings, which cover
the four sides, have been reproduced in plate 22, fig. 3. Many parts of some of
the engravings have become so worn by long-continued use as to be too indistinct
to admit of interpretation. The figures are, on the whole, rather deeply and
boldly incised, and show a marked likeness to the rest of the work from the
locality where it was evidently made.

The coloring matter in the incisions has assumed a deep brown color, as if the
original black had become covered or replaced by dirt or grease.

DRILL Bow. Kotzebue Sound. KE. W. Nelson. 48526. Very deep and strong
engravings on old ivory.

DRILL, OR HANDLE. Kotzebue Sound. E. W. Nelson. 48527. This old stained
piece bears upon the two upper sides anumber of animal forms, one row being
a series of six reindeer, together with several seals and whales. <A native in his
kaiak is represented with his arms uplifted, and probably the fingers were drawn
spread, use of specimen having worn the surface smooth.

One underside has a long row of ten woives and one reindeer, faced by a
hunter shooting an arrow, who is accompanied by two other hunters and a dog.
The other side shows a whale hunt and a walrus and bear hunt, the two hunt-

ing scenes being divided by a narrow vertical line bearing delicate cross-
hatchings, and denotes the partition of the two.

WORK BAG FASTENER. Sabotnisky. E.W.Nelson. 48966. Made of a three-sided
piece of ivory in which the corners have been rounded and smoothed. The
ornamentations are sets of cross-lines, to the center of which are short lateral
lines, and between each such transverse set are small black spots and crosses.

DriLtt Bow. Hotham Inlet. E.W.Nelson. 64153. <A piece originally almost square,
but by perforating at the ends, from beneath, the specimen was split vertically.
Both sides are ornamented, however, one side with but a few scratches, while
the other has a very interesting whale and walrus hunt.

DRILL BOW. Hotham Inlet. E. W. Nelson. 64152. An old specimen with four
sides crudely engraved. Shooting with firearms, dragging seals, etc., comprises
the subjects portrayed. Three whale’s flukes are also erected, to denote that
animal, while a dog sledge, with very rude drawing of the dog.

DRILL Bow. Diomede Island. E. W. Nelson. 63621. Only 9 inches long and
averages one-fourth of an inch square; yet the four sides are ornamented;
three have lateral longitudinal border lines, between which are recorded numer-
ous figures of umiaks after walrus and a ceremonial dance with one drummer.
On another side is a village, showing summer habitations or conical houses,
near meat racks, some boats, etc. The under side bears several animal forms,
and two mythic figures resembling the water monster, i. e., an elongated four-
footed and horned or crested serpent, referred to by Naomoff in connection with
fig. 139, ¢.

DRILL BOW. Point Hope. E.W.Nelson. 63802. Very crude though deeply incised
line, composing animals, etc., is shown on rather white ivory. An interesting
whale hunt is shown; the flukes appear like detached decorative ones, attached
to the rear end_of bodies.

Flukes are also shown at one place; while a native crawling along on his
stomach, to approach seals, is also engraved.

Upon the top edge are four birds, four different forms of representing them.

BaG HANDLE. Point Hope. E.W.Nelson. 63803. The undersurface of this stained
old specimen bears the figures of eleven outstretched hides, at the right being
a human figure. Upon the top face is some linear decoration, while near the
middle of the specimen are figures of four reindeer, facing to the right. Portions
of the figures are without the brown-black stain, the legs being slender and
the hoofs indicated by minute etchings made by a sharp-pointed graver.

Upon the outer curve are a number of nucleated rings, 33 in number, and
each three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. The under side bears a median
line, upon which are portrayed, in various attitudes, nine reindeer. ‘The figures
are rather deeply incised and very black. The coloring matter in several places
has fallen out, as if it had become hard or dry.

Bow OR HANDLE. ‘‘Chilcat.” J.J. McLean. 67904. An almost square, slightly
curved specimen, with engravings on all sides excepting the under or concave
one. The top or convex surface bears, among other objects, a large umiak, the
four occupants of which are indicated by the heads, arms, and paddles only, the
vertical body line being purposely omitted or forgotten. Some conventional
trees are used as ornamental markings. The sides bear seal hunts, and most of
the records have been reproduced in the text,
966 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Each side is ornamented by two deeply incised grooves, one at either edge of
the faces of the bow, and the engravings are deeply and forcibly made, all being
filled in with black. : bn,

Though marked as from ‘‘Chileat,” the specimen has the characteristic appear-
ance of the work done by the natives of Norton Sound.

BaG HANDLE. Point Barrow. Lieutenant P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 89420. Measures
142 inches in length, the upper surface being rather flat, while the under side is
rounded or convex. Upon the upper surface are twelve reindeer, one behind the
other and facing the left, while at the extreme right is a man holding a bow
drawn, but no arrow indicated; while at the extreme right is a figure resembling
an outstretched bearskin. The engravings are strongly incised and greatly
resemble those made at Norton Sound and Kotzebue Sound. There is no coloring
matter in any place, and it is believed that the work was not made by Point
Barrow natives, but secured by them by traffic or otherwise from some locality
farther south and west than Point Barrow.

The arrangement of the reindeer, the apparent similarity in all respects, and
their regular spacing—between the figures—suggests that, although the record
seems to be intended for a hunting score, it was also made with a view to pre-
senting an ornamental and decorative appearance.

Bears no decoration.

DRILL Bow. Point Barrow. Lieutenant P. H. Ray, U.S. A. 89777. Bears a ver-
tical line with radiating lines from one side only. The ivory is pieced near one
end to lengthen the bow; the coloring matter is pale, but consisted of a reddish
substance resembling red ocher.

DRILL Bow. St. Michaels. L.M. Turner. 129223. Ornamented on lower side bya
“solid” herd of reindeer, wolves, seals, walrus, and other animals. The inci-
sions are deeply cut and are left uncolored, appearing light yellowish gray as
compared with the dark surrounding surface. Made of reindeer horn.

DRILL Bow. Location not given. M. M. Hazen. 154071. Whaling ships in pur-

NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF THE
PENINSULA OF LOWER CALIFORNIA.

By GEORGE P. MERRILL,

Curator, Department of Geology, U. S. National Museum.

During the summer of 1892 the writer had occasion to pay a brief
visit to the peninsula of Lower California, going by boat from San Diego
to San Quentin, and thence by wagon and pack train to El Rosario and
across to within a few miles of the Gulf Coast, the route lying approxi-
mately along the line of the thirtieth parallel. The trip was hurriedly
made with the scanty equipments furnished by a prospector’s outfit,
and opportunities for detailed work were quite lacking. The resultant
geological observations have already found their way into print, but a
brief abstract from the original publication’ may well be given here.
The excuse for the present paper lies in the fact that the region, aside
from being comparatively unknown and difficult of access, presents
many features of interest from the standpoint of both naturalist and
archeologist.

Fortunately the writer carried with him a folding kodak, and though
the good work done by the instrument was in some degree undone by the
carelessness or ignorance of a professional photographer in San Diego,
enough remains to give, with the aid of a little touching up, the views
here shown. In the pages following the remarks on the physiography
and geology of the region are quoted from the paper above mentioned.
The itinerary is compiled from memoranda made at the time.

(1) PHYSIOGRAPHY.

“The peninsula of Baja California is a narrow strip of broken moun-
tainous land extending roughly from 22° 50/ to 32° 30’ north latitude,
about 775 miles long and from 35 to 70 miles in width, with a general
northwest and southeast trend parallel to the larger orographic features
of the Pacific Slope. Its coast outline, characterized as it is at many

972 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

points by .ong sweeps or reentering curves, with outlying islands and
projecting points partly inclosing oval, valley-like basins, is at once
suggestive of a partially submerged series of mountain chains.

‘The peninsula is divided by Gabb’ into three geographical provinces:
A southern, extending from Cape St. Lucas to beyond La Paz, char-
acterized by irregular granite mountain chains up to 5,000 feet in
height, and with deep valleys containing considerable fertile arable
land; an intermediate desert region, characterized by table-lands and
flat-topped ridges, with a considerable extent of interior valleys, and
with isolated mountain tops and ranges projecting above the general
mesa level, which rarely reach an elevation of more than 3,000 to 4,000
feet. This region has no running water and springs are very scarce; a
high northern portion from 5,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level forming
a southern continuation of the mountain region of southern California,
which has a number of running streams and large valleys susceptible
of cultivation, while the higher portions contain considerable extents
of pine forests.

“The limits of these three provinces are not sharply defined, but may
be taken at about 200 miles in longitudinal extent for the northern, 450
miles for the intermediate desert region, and 100 miles for the southern.”

* * * * * * *

‘““While from a first glance at existing maps it might appear that the
depressions of the Mohave and Colorado deserts and of the Guif of
California were the normal southern extensions of the great depression
of the San Juan and Sacramento valleys, and that the Peninsula range
was therefore the normal southern continuation of the coast range,
there is some reason to be found in its topographical form, and still
more, as will be seen later, in its geological structure, for the assumption
that the peninsula more properly represents the southern extension of
the Sierra Nevada uplift. On this assumption the connection between
the two would be afforded by the various en echelon ranges known as
San Jacinto Mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, etc., lying to the
northward, while the southern extension of the Coast range proper, cut
off by the reentering angle of the coast between Santa Barbara and
Los Angeles, would be represented by the chain of islands, Santa
Catalina, San Clemente, etc., generally known as the Channel Islands,
lying off the coast between Los Angeles and San Diego.

“To the south of San Diego the mountains come down to the sea and
the mesa disappears, being only represented by an occasional patch of
later beds which have escaped erosion, as at Sausal and Todos Santos,
60 miles south of the boundary. At Cape Colnett, in latitude 31°, a
strip of mesa forms the immediate coast and widens southward toward
San Quentin, in latitude 30° 30’, which is assumed to be about the limit
of the northern or mountainous province. From San Quentin south-

United States, 1868, pp. 630-639.

ward, as far as examined by the writers, the mesa structure is charac-
teristic of the Pacific Coast, the table-lands rising to a height of 1,000
to 2,000 feet at comparatively short distances from the sea, and pre-
senting bold blufts of soft horizontally stratified beds, often capped by
lava flows, which are evidently wearing away rapidly under the erosive
action of waves.

‘‘ Lindgren, as a result of his observations in the vicinity of Ensenada
de Todos Santos, divides the topographic features of the peninsula
Sierra into three sections:

(1) The coast range, rising gradually from the sea to an elevation of
3,000 feet in a distance of 20 to 30 miles. Surmounting this area several
minor ranges and sharp peaks attaining an elevation of 3,000 to 4,000
feet. A rapid descent leads from the divide of the coast range to—

(2) The interior valleys, an interrupted series of depressions in the
middle of the chain at an elevation of 1,800 to 2,000 feet.

(3) The eastern range, rising rapidly from the valleys and continuing
as an almost level plateau, with a gentle slope up to the peninsular
divide and an abrupt, almost precipitous, descent to the desert. The
elevation of this remarkable plateau is from 4,000 to 5,000 feet.

“This plateau region, which supports a considerable growth of pine
forest, extends, according to the meager accounts obtainable, from the
boundary southward about to latitude 31°, reaching its culminating
point in the high mountain mass now known as San Pedro de Martis,
which is apparently the same as the snow-capped mountain called in
the Narragansett report ‘‘Calamahue,” or Santa Catalina (Caterina)
Mountain.

‘The area examined by the present writers, which extends 15 to 30 min-
utes north and south of the thirtieth parallel of latitude, is separated by
a considerable gap of unknown country from that described by Lindgren.
In this latitude the average elevation of the peninsula is about 2,000
feet, and that of its higher ridges may be taken at less than 3,500 feet.
It is a singularly arid region, having practically no running water on
the surface and very few permanent springs; nevertheless our experi-
ence has shown that properly located wells obtain a fair supply of
water at depths of 20 to 60 feet. The climate is remarkably equable
and healthful, being but little warmer than that of the coast region of
southern California, and as a rule much drier. The diurnal changes
of temperature are, however, very great. It is swept by continuous
breezes from either coast, which appear to blow alternately about three
days at a time, those from the Pacific being laden with more or less
moisture, while the east winds are extremely dry. Like California, it
has a rainy season in the spring, but this is generally but a few days’

duration and extremely irregular and uncertain.”

974 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

“This whole region may be in one sense considered to be a mesa region,
since at one time the present mesa formation extended from coast to
coast, but at the present day the mesas are no longer continuous, and
erosion has disclosed an underlying or buried topography, whose
general features show considerable analogy with the more northern
region described by Lindgren. The mesa belt proper adjoining the
western coast is represented by a series of plateaus from 960 to 2,000
feet in elevation, separated by the deep canyon-like valleys of streams
that drain the interior. Owing to the soft, crumbling nature of the
beds, the escarpments are very abrupt, and the topography has some-
thing of the character of the Bad Lands of the Great Plains.

“The coast or western range is represented by a series of isolated
peaks or ridges rising 1,000 or 2,000 feet above the general mesa level,
which are partly connected together by flat-topped ridges base-leveled
down to the average elevation of the highest portion of the mesa
region, but which in geological structure and composition belong to the
same system of uplift as the higher peaks.

“Bast of this range lie the interior valleys, broad, level, or gently
sloping plains 10 to 15 miles in width and with an elevation above
sea level of 1,800 to 2,200 feet, bounded and traversed by mesa-topped
ridges and with occasional sharp peaks rising out of them. These
interior valieys all drain to the Pacific through gaps in the western
range and rise gently to the eastward, the same gentle westward slope
being noticeable in the mesa-topped ridges.

‘‘On the eastern edge of these valleys, at a distance of about 10 to 15
miles from the Gulf Coast, a most sudden change in topographical
structure takes place. The broad, level plains, in which the drainage ~
courses are so shallow that their direction of drainage is with difficulty
recognizable, give place to deep, narrow, tortuous ravines, descending
a thousand or more feet within a few miles of the mesa-topped divide.
These ravines wind along a series of sharp jagged peaks, which evi-
dently are the projecting summits of an older and partially buried
mountain chain. The eastern range is represented in part by the sum-
mits of this buried range, in part by a series of isolated table-topped
mountains rising to an elevation of 3,500 feet, which brings them above
the summits of most of the sharper peaks to the eastward. On the
immediate Gulf Coast is a gently sloping mesa, of varying width, at
the base of the eastern range. To the south of the region visited, the
buried mountains rise still higher than these table topped mountains
and send out spurs to the westward, which apparently cut off the
interior valley in that direction. To the north they do not rise above
the level of the interior valley, and the mesa-tupped ridges sweep over
them, descending in a series of terraces or steps to the Gulf Coast.

“The rocks, of which this eastern buried range is composed, outcrop
so frequently in the bottom of the interior valley that it is probable
that this valley rests in part upon a plateau-like shoulder of the buried
GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 975

range, and that its form was not unlike that of the granite plateau
described by Lindgren in the latitude of Ensenada.

‘From Gabb’s description it would appear that a similar topograph-
ical structure obtains for the part of the peninsula stretching south
from latitude 29° to La Paz. The eastern range has for the most part
a mesa-topped crest, broken here and there by projecting ridges, which
stretch in part across the peninsula and separate the interior valleys.
The interior valleys, set off successively a little more to the southward
and westward, become more extensive southward, one being described
as Stretching from La Purissima to Todos Santos (of the south), a dis-
tance of 150 to 200 miles, with an average width of 10 miles. The
western range is apparently still more indistinct as a topographical
feature and is not recognized by him, but the western mesa region is _
spoken of as stretching in varying width from Magdalena Bay, in lati-
tude 24° 30’, to Cape Colnett, in latitude 31°.”

(2) GEOLOGY.

‘“‘For purposes of geological description the region examined may be
divided into the coast or mesa belt, the western range, the interior val-
ley, and the easternrange. Theimmediate Gulf Coast was not visited.”
On Plate 1' is given a generalized section across the peninsula along
the line A-B. Topographical features at some distance from this line
are brought in to illustrate the general structure... Though not drawn
to scale, care has been taken to make the section as close an approxi-
mation to nature as the data would admit. Distances were estimated
in traveling to and fro and checked by rough triangulations made with
a prismatic compass. The vertical scale is intended to be about four
times larger than the horizontal.

COAST OR MESA BELT.

“This area has an average width of 10 to 15 miles, and in it, so far as
observed, no older rocks occur than horizontally bedded, loosely aggre-
gated clayey sands, sandstones, and conglomerates, of which the lowest
horizons carry characteristic forms of the Chico Cretaceous. In a
higher horizon of this apparently conformable series a characteristic
fauna of the Tejon-Eocene has been found, and in still higher beds a
few forms of probable Miocene age were observed. Noneof these beds
show evidence of any considerable disturbance, though in a few
instances dips of 10 to 15 degrees and slight displacements with a throw
of only a few feet have been observed. They have, however, been exten-
sively eroded, and later deposits of post-Pliocene and possibly also of
Pliocene age have been deposited upon their eroded surface. Recent
eruptive rocks, both acid and basic, have cut through them and in
places have been important factors in shaping topographical forms by
protecting the softer beds from erosion.

“The pest exposures of the lower beds were found between Canoas

and Bluff points [Plate 1,] where they present perpendicular bluffs,
facing the sea, from a few hundred up to nearly a thousand feet in
height. These are being rapidly undermined and eaten back by the
action of the waves, so that between the two points the coast line forms
a bow-like reentering curve, set back 3 to 5 miles from a line drawn
between the points. From either point the land rises in a series of
steps or broken terraces to an extensive plateau, cut on the sea faces
by short, narrow, branching ravines aud presenting in general contin-
uous bluff faces inland.
_ “Midway in the reentering curve between Canoas and Bluff points is
the Playa Santa Caterina, where is a gap a mile or two in width between
the bluffs bordering the ocean, formed by a broad valley in which are
two modern stream beds draining the interior region. They are divided
at the shore line by a flat-topped ridge of Chico beds, near the top of
which is the remnant of an ancient stream bed whose bottom is now
about 100 feet above tide water, and which is filled by a conglomerate
of large bowlders and water-worn pebbles of massive rocks. This con-
glomerate, which is cemented by lime and iron, is so much more resist-
ing than the soft clays of the Chico formation that the huge bowlders
that fall as the cliff is undermined by wave action form a point pro-
jecting out several hundred feet beyond the average coast line. These
conglomerates are probably of the same age as those which are found
at various points in the canyons of the interior, and their formation
evidently dates back to a time when, after the carving out of the gen-
eral system of modern drainage, the waters of the ocean reached a
higher level than the present, and the old drainage channels were par-
tially filled up to the then base level. Subsequent erosion, while cut-
ting down to a somewhat lower level and following the same general
lines, has often eaten more readily into the softer beds at the sides of
these recent conglomerates and left patches of them still standing,
which sometimes form one wall of the canyon a hundred or more feet
above its present bottom.

“The modern stream beds from Playa Santa Caterina are almost at
base level for some 10 miles inland, at about which distance eruptive
rocks appear from under the Cretaceous and recent beds, and then rise
rapidly, reaching an elevation of about 1,500 feet within 15 miles of the
coast, on the partly buried slopes of the coast range.

“Both in the broad valley and on the mesa slopes are relics of terraces
which evidence a successive rising of the land above the ocean.

“The lower beds exposed in the blufis along the coast have a gentle
inclination northward and southward from Sandstone Point, about 3
miles north of Playa Santa Caterina, where massive sandstones form a
slightly projecting headland. In these sandstones carbonized plant
remains, too indefinite for identification, were found, and in the cracks of
the immediately overlying sandy clays were traces of petroleum. From
GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 977

these beds and from calcareous layers about 200 feet above were
obtained the following forms, as determined by T. W. Stanton:

Arca breweriana, Gabb. Inoceramus, sp. undetermined.
Baculites chicoensis, Trask. Ammonites, sp. undetermined.
Tessarolax distorta, Gabb. Ostrea, sp. undetermined.

‘“They correspond with forms found in the Chico beds of California
and Oregon.

‘From rolled pebbles of impure limestone obtained along the beach
to the south of the Playa, which had evidently fallen from the cliffs
above, and from a bed of similar composition in place at what was
assumed to be about 1,200 feet higher in horizon, at San Carlos anechor-
age (collected by A. D. Foote), 8 miles north of Bluff Point, the
following forms were identified by T. W. Stanton:

Cardita planicostata, Lam. Tellina, sp. undetermined.
Leda gabbi, Conrad. Turritella, sp. undetermined.
Urosyca caudata, Gabb. Dentalium, sp. undetermined.
Nucula, sp. undetermined. Crassatella, sp. undetermined.

and are considered by him to belong undoubtedly to the Téjon Eocene,

“The beds carrying Chico and Téjon fossils were not observed in
direct superposition, but from the negative evidence that no decided
unconformities were detected at any of the points examined, it is
assumed that the two series are conformable, or that in any case no
considerable disturbance of the strata took place between the times of
their respective depositions.

“The great mesa or plateau, 15 miles long and 6 to 8 miles in width,
which extends from the valley of Santa Caterina northward beyond
San Carlos, has an elevation of from 1,800 to 2,000 feet, being some-
what higher at the northern end. The greater part of its surface is
apparently capped by basalt flows, which have protected it from
erosion. From a distance can be distinguished conical points rising
above the level of the mesa, known as the “ Sombrero,” the “‘ Hat,” ete.,
which resemble recent craters in general form. At one point on the
coast, fragments of the basalt, cemented together by crystalline calcite,
have fallen to the foot of the bluff in huge masses and form a projecting
point on the coast line.

“For about a mile beyond Sandstone Point the beach is covered with
beautifully rounded pebbles of porphyries and a great variety of hard
rocks, mostly older eruptive, whose material must have come down a
ravine which drains the western face of the plateau and descends
very rapidly from its summit. As no such pebbles were observed in
the Chico or Téjon series, nor on the beaches to the south where no
upper beds remain, it is thought probable that the mesa sandstones,
which are characterized by an abundance of eruptive material, may
form the upper portion of this plateau.

‘“Northward from San Carlos, as seen from the ocean or from com-
manding points of view in the interior, the same character of beds,

with their characteristic bad-land topography, extend northward to
the Rosario Ravine.

“The hamlet of Rosario is situated a few miles from the sea, in this
ravine or canyon, which extends intand for some 10 or 15 miles with
very gradual rise of its beds, and carries a small stream of running
water that in dry seasons sinks below the surface sands. [Plate 2.]

‘The cliffs of the canyon walls are eroded into castellated forms that
recall the buttes at Green River, Wyoming, familiar to travelers on
the Union Pacific Railroad. Opposite Rosario the bedding planes have
a dip of 15 degrees to the northeastward, while the surface of the mesa
is quite horizontal, and from the pebbles and recent shells on its sur-
face evidently represents a higher level of the ocean waters, which have
base-leveled it at about 1,000 feet above present sea level. For a few
miles north of the mouth of the Rosario Canyon the bluffs come close
to the present coast line and then gradually retreat, until opposite San
Quentin they are about 8 miles inland. The immediate shore is first a
terrace about 200 feet above the sea level, then at the mouth of the
Socorro Valley a triangular-shaped Quaternary delta hardly 50 feet
above sea level, covered with rolled pebbles and recent marine shells.
The older beds forming the mesa region in this latitude, though not
markedly different from those between Bluff and Canoas points, contain
a larger proportion of conglomerate material and several fossiliferous
beds of recent looking shells, among which were recognized Mytilus
californianus and a fragment of Pecten, like P. cerrosensis, which Dr.
W. Hz. Dall regards as indicating a probable Miocene age. These are
the beds seen by Gabb on his trip and called by him “mesa sandstones.”
No evidence of unconformity between these and the Téjon beds was
observed, and it seems probable that they may constitute the highest
part of the mesa at Bluff Point, but this was not determined by fossil
evidence.

“ Northward from Socorro River the bluffs of the mesa formation
retreat gradually from the ocean, and at San Quentin are separated
from it by the sandy plains of Santa Maria, about 8 miles wide and
but a few feet above sea level, which are the northern continuation of
the depressions of the bay of San Quentin. The immediate coast line
at San Quentin is formed by a group of six conical hills of basalt, from
400 to 800 feet high, which, judging from the uneroded character of the
lava flows which have issued from their flanks, must be of very recent
eruption. One of these flows extending southward about 7 miles forms
the low, narrow tongue of land known as Cape San Quentin. It is evi-
dently the superior resistance of these hard lavas that has thus far
protected the plains of Santa Maria from the encroachments of the sea.

WESTERN RANGE.

“In the present topography the western range is very ill defined, and
consists of a number of irregular ridges and isolated mountain masses
15 to 20 miles from the coast, the highest summits of which are probably

less than 4,000 feet above sea level. Between the peaks are broad,
transverse valleys and flat-topped ridges whose higher summits have
the same general level with those of the higher plateaus of the mesa
region—that is, about 2,000 feet. Rounded pebbles and an occasional
fragment of recent shells were found on these summits, which
strengthen the opinion that this was a pene-plain of recent times,
probably formed at the time of the greatest submergence since the
deposition of the mesa sandstones.

“The range was traversed on two lines—that of the arroyo of Santa
Caterina, shown in the section | Plate 1], and that of the Rosario arroyo.
The river bed or arroyo of San Fernando crosses it about midway
between these two. Near the mission of San Fernando is a consider-
able development of sedimentary beds, one of which is a much altered
bluish limestone containing unrecognizable fossils, which is probably
either of early Mesozoic or Paleozoic age. [Plate 3.| The beds have a
steep dip to the eastward; at one point are overturned against a con-
siderable body of acid eruptives and diorite. On the line of the Rosario
arroyo it consists mainly of diabase, with acid eruptives and diorites
on their eastern flank. The latter cut the diabases, and are succeeded
on the east by an extensive flow of rhyolite capping the mesa ridges
which extend out into the interior valley. A little farther south dio-
rites seem to form the main mass of the flat-topped ridges which here
represent the range, and which are flanked on the east, at the border
of the mesa region, by recent tufaceous rocks, in which is found one of
the few springs of the region. Along the line of the section south of
San Fernando, diorites again predominate, and in these occur deposits
of copper sulphides, one of which has been quite extensively mined.

‘It was not possible to determine the relative age of all the varieties
of eruptive rock observed, but the older eruptives are evidently pre-
Chico, while some of the recent eruptives are certainly more recent than
the mesa sandstones.

‘The rocks described above as acid eruptives are compact and some-
times brecciated quartz-porphyries of greenish and brownish colors, at
times quite aphanitic, and again showing small phenocrysts of feldspar
and more rarely quartz, sufficiently developed to be recognizable by the
naked eye. Chemical tests in the more aphanitic varieties yield 70 to
75 per cent silica. The more common form of the diorite is a pinkish
gray, finely granular rock, which in thin section shows a hypidiomorphic
granular aggregate of quartz and triclinic feldspar with pale green
hornblendes, in part or wholly altered to epidote. There are also a few
sphenes and the usual iron ores.

‘In the upper Santa Caterina Valley, which crosses the range diag-
onally in a nearly north-and-south direction, a very considerable mass
of underlying granitic rock is exposed over an extent of about 10 miles
along the bottom of the valley, which apparently grades into the finer-
grained diorites surrounding it. Along the center of the valley a low
ridge of rounded blocks of this very massive rock has the appearance
980 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

at first glance of a morainal ridge with huge erratics, but examination
shows that the rounded forms are merely the results of weathering
under the peculiar climatic conditions ot the region. The granite is
an even-grained granular rock, thickly studded with small black scales
of mica and small hornblendes. In thin section it shows a hypidio-
morphic granular aggregation of quartz, feldspars, black mica, and
deep green hornblende, with a sprinkling of iron ores, apatite, and
rarely zircons. It resembles the granites of the Sierra Nevada.

“Westward alon g the line of the section this granite is succeeded by
the finer grained quartz-mica-diorite described above, and then by a
belt several miles in width of recent eruptives, which form low rounded
hills adjoing the mesa region. These appeared to be mostly rhyolites,
and to have cut through the sedimentaries of the mesa region, though
it was not possible to obtain unquestionable evidence of the latter fact.

“On the east, or at the head of the Santa Caterina Valley, capping
the flat ridges which form the western divide of the interior valleys,
was found a rather remarkable rock of the hypersthene-andesite type,
showing microscopically small olivines and white feldspars, with ocea-
sional black hornblendes in a dark gray matrix. In thin section it
shows adecided andesitic ground mass of augite and plagioclase micro-
lites, with the usual iron ores and abundant colorless olivines, pale
hypersthenes, small pale green augites, and an occasional dark basaltic
hornblende with black border.

‘Abundant chalcedony and Hint concretions, with dendritic markings,
constituting the popularly known moss agates, are found on the eastern
slopes of these ridges.

INTERIOR VALLEY.

“The interior valley which was visited by the writers is probably that
designated by Gabb as the plain of Buena Vista. In about latitude
30°, or a little north of the line of the section, its width on a northeast-
southwest line, or at right angles to the trend of the peninsula, is over
15 miles, an almost level plain with a slight rise toward its eastern rim,
which rests on the submerged flanks and crests of the eastern range.
Its elevation varies from about 2,000 feet on the western to 2,300 feet
on the eastern edge. To the southward its width is contracted by the
encroachments of the bounding ranges which send out spurs or ridges
into it, and in the far distance appear to merge together. The spurs
from the eastern range are flat-topped in great part and composed
of horizontally-bedded material, which, where examined, consisted
largely of volcanic ash carrying abundant fragments of basic erup-
tives. These are evidently the mesa sandstones of Gabb. Those
from the western range, on the other hand, are composed largely of
eruptive rocks and appear to be projecting portions of the older moun-
tains laid bare by erosion, but in a few cases are mesa-topped ridges,
capped by horizontal lava flows of later age than the mesa sandstones.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 981

‘To the north the valley appears to grow wider, and out of its midst
rise a few conical peaks, the most prominent of which, known as San
Juan de Dios | Plate 4], about 20 miles north of the line of the section,
has a remarkably graceful outline and a probable elevation of over
4,000 feet. It is composed, in great measure, of eruptive rocks, among
which felsite, diabase, liparite, and basalt were recognized, while ero-
sion has disclosed on one side an underlying coarse quartzite. At its
base is one of the rare springs of the region. Similar peaks are seen to
rise out of the plain far to the northward at probable distances of 10
to 15 miles apart.

‘The slope of the broad stream beds in the lower part of the valley is
so imperceptible that the direction of its drainage is difficult to deter-
mine; but aneroid observations indicate that the portion examined is
drained through the gap in the western range at the ruined mission of
San Fernando (elevation about 1,800 feet), and thence probably by the
San Fernando River bed to the.Pacific Ocean. Limited portions of
the eastern edge to the north of the line section are drained by deep
and narrow arroyos of more recent formation into the Gulf of Cali-
fornia. The present bottoms of the valleys are occupied by recent
deposits of porous limestone or travertine and coarse conglomerate
with calcareous cement containing rounded fragments of both eruptive
and sedimentary rocks in great variety and varying size up to several
feet in diameter. The evidence of wells which get water in the lower
parts of the valley at 40 to 60 feet below the surface and of adjoining
mesas in the valley, which afford partial sections, show a present thick-
ness of little over 100 feet of these beds; but their elevation in shallow
ravines—notably the one on the southeastern edge of the Buena Vista
plain, in which are the New Pedrara onyx deposits, and remnants of
caleareous conglomerates remaining on the flanks of the bounding
ridges at other points—indicate that the original thickness of these
deposits may have been several hundred feet, and that the greater part
has already been removed by erosion. No fossil evidence was obtained
as to their absolute geological age, but the character and position of
the deposits indicate that they were laid down in an inclosed body
of water, probably an interior lake of comparatively recent date.
What remains of these beds barely serves to smooth over the inequali-
ties of the underlying mountains, whose component rock masses often
outcrop across the stream beds, especially along the eastern portion of
the valley. Even where there is no actual outcrop the appearance of
frequent fragments of granite or sedimentary rocks, as the case may
be, indicate that these rocks are to be found in place near by and not
far from the surface. In some cases the ground is whitened over con-
siderable areas by the abundant small fragments of vein quartz, result-
ing from the disintegration of the underlying slates.

“The relative age of the interior lake beds may be assumed to bear
some relation to that of the calcareous conglomerate already mentioned
982 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

which partially filled the earlier canyons of the Pacific Slope. After
the deposition and subsequent elevation of the mesa sandstones, which
are assumed to be of late Tertiary age, there must have been a long
period of erosion, during which the interior valley was carved out and
drained through the deeper canyons running to the Pacific Ocean.
This was apparently followed by an extensive submergence of 2,000
feet or more, since which time the whole peninsula has been gradually
rising by periodic movements, with considerable base leveling in the
intervals.

“The present elevation of the mesa-topped ridges of the western
range indicates a base leveling of the region at an elevation of about
2,000 feet above present sea level. This might have filled up all the
outlets of the interior region across the western range and admitted
of the inclosures of a body of water up to that level; but to account
for the present position of the deposits on the eastern side of the
valley, it is necessary to assume a subsequent differential movement
by which that side has been raised a few hundred feet more than the
eastern side.”

EASTERN RANGE.

‘¢ The older or buried eastern range is made up of granite and gneiss,
with highly altered sedimentary strata flanking it on the northeast,
which stand either vertical or with a steep dip to the eastward and
strike about northwest, or somewhat more to the west of north than
the general trend of the peninsula. The present divide, on the other
hand, follows the general trend of the coast line at a distance of 10 to
15 miles from it, and is marked in general by abrupt escarpments along
the eastern edge of the desert plain.

“To the north of the limits of the field of observation, beyond the
thirtieth parallel, the summits of the older range have been planned
off and their depressions so evenly filled up by the more recent deposits
that they play no part in the present topography of the country. To
the south, however, where, east of the present divide, they have been
denuded of the more recent deposits, or still farther south, where they
were never completely covered by these deposits, they form conspicu-
ous and striking topographical features, in marked contrast with the
prevailing horizontal lines and broad shallow valleys of the western
portion of the peninsula.

“In the northern region the desert plains and flat-topped ridges of
mesa sandstones rise very gently from the west to the divide line, which
almost invariably presents an abrupt escarpment to the east, over-
looking a region deeply scored by narrow gorges several hundred feet
in depth, with almost vertical walls. Here the divide line is marked by
occasional isolated table topped buttes, capped by rhyolite, which rise
500 to 1,000 feet above the desert level and serve to mark the original
level of the mesa sandstones, which have been protected from erosion
by the cap of more enduring rock. These rhyolites are generally of
GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 983

earlier date than the lake beds. The top of the mesa sandstones as
thus determined is about 3,000 feet above present sea level, and their
maximum observed thickness 800 feet. Augite andesite flows, appar-
ently of more recent date, are found capping intermediate portions of
the divide. The contrast in topographical structure between the region
east and west of the divide is here less marked than in the region to
the south, as on both sides approximately horizontal lines prevail.
The surface of the mesa-topped ridges slopes upward toward it from
either direction, but the slope is much greater on the eastern side and
the ridges descend toward the gulf in a series of step-like terraces,
while the whole eastern region is deeply scored by narrow, steep-sided
ravines from a few hundred to a thousand feet in depth. The upturned
beds of the metamorphic series are well exposed along the walls of these
ravines, often reaching the surface of the intervening mesas. They
are also seen in the shallow stream beds of the desert plains on the
west, and, as already remarked, often outcrop through the thin covering
of the lake beds for a considerable distance out on to the desert.

‘South of the thirtieth parallel the summits of the buried range rise
gradually, and east of the divide are completely denuded of any cov-
ering of recent beds that they may have had. They also spread out to
the eastward, approaching more and more closely to the gulf coast, and
south of the limits of the field of observation, or 20 miles south of the
thirtieth parallel, they constitute a high granite range extending 10 or
15 miles westward into the interior valley and effectually cutting oft
any view of the country beyond.

“The region in the vicinity of the New Pedrara onyx deposits, a few
miles south of the thirtieth parallel, shows well the general structure
of the eastern range as presented in generalized form in the section on
plate 1, and will hence be described in some detail.

“The principal onyx deposits are situated in a shallow ravine or
eastern arm of the interior valley, between two ridges of mesa sand-
stone, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet. Since the denudation of the
granite bed of this ravine of its former covering of mesa sandstone it has
been filled to a depth of about 100 feet by alternate beds of travertine
and calcareous conglomerate, which were probably contemporaneous
and at one time continuous with the lake beds of the interior valley.

“The winding bed of the modern stream cuts into the travertine
deposit, exposing at one place a cliff of over 20 feet in height, showing
three distinct layers of ‘‘ Mexican onyx,” one of which is over 3 feet thick,
interstratified with the travertine, while for a distance of nearly a mile
down the ravine sheets of the more resisting onyx cap the little traver-
tine mesas on either side. The occurrence of the onyx, which is a ther-
mal spring and surface deposit in successive layers, separated by traver-
tine and resting on conglomerate, indicates a probable successive rise
and fall of the waters of the lake where the travertine was deposited,
which would have admitted of some slight erosion of the deposit in
984 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the periods when the lake waters had temporarily retreated—a hypoth-
esis that was confirmed by the finding of some fragments of onyx in
the upper travertine beds.

‘At the head of the ravine the travertine beds end abruptly in an
escarpment, beyond which one descends rapidly 500 feet through wind-
ing ravines, between sharp, jagged ridges of a metamorphic rock, to
the bed of the Tule arroyo, a winding, v-shaped gorge which runs north-
ward about 10 miles, then northeastward to the Gulf of California,
draining the whole region east of the divide. At one point this gorge
widens out into quite a valley, in which are travertine deposits about
50 feet in thickness, with layers of onyx in the upper part. Relies of
the thermal action are found at the present day in a little effervescent
spring, known as the Volcan, which issues from the top of a dome-
shaped mound of calcareous tufa in the narrow bottom of the ravine
before it opens out into the valley containing the travertine deposits.
[See Plate 5.|

“‘ These travertine deposits are entirely isolated and have no present
connection with those of the interior valley to the east of the divide,
their level being about 400 feet lower than the divide, where the nearest
lake-bed deposits end. The similarity of their composition, their rela-
tions to the underlying rocks, to the onyx formation, and to modern
erosion, all suggest, however, a common origin with the lake beds, and
if once connected with them there must have been a differential move-
ment since their deposition which produced the present difference of
level.

“Beyond the Tule arroyo to the eastward arise a series of sharp,
jagged peaks which attain a maximum elevation of about 3,000 feet,
deeply scored by a most intricate system of deep, winding ravines,
quite impassable except to foot travelers, and which are in most strik-
ing topographical contrast to the level valleys and plains of the region
west of the divide. Within these hills at various points are placers
from which the Mexicans obtain considerable coarse gold by dry wash-
ing during the months immediately following the spring rains. At
other seasons there is not enough water to support life. They are com-
posed of distinctly stratified sedimentary beds standing on edge and
striking northwest and southeast, but which are so highly metamor-
phosed and so blackened and splintered by the weathering of this arid
region that their original character can no longer be determined. They
are mostly dark siliceous slates and fine-grained mica-schists. Some
beds have all the external appearance of limestones in their granular
structure and thin white veins, but their present composition shows
no trace of lime and is almost entirely siliceous. They are traversed
by well-defined dikes, which are also intensely altered.

“Among the more striking rocks in this metamorphic series, at the
northern limits of the area observed, was a fine-grained hornblende
rock which microscopic examination shows to be properly an altered dio-

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 985

rite. The ground mass consists of an aggregate of plagioclase feldspar,
apparently anorthite, with fibrous hornblende containing inclusions
suggestive of interpolations of hypersthene and diallage. Associated
with this was a grayish massive rock thickly studded with short, stout
erystals of black hornblende 2 to 5 millimeters in diameter and 5 to 8
millimeters in length. Microscopical examinations show the ground
mass to be a granular aggregate of almost colorless augites with a few
plagioclase feldspars, and the rock apparently belongs to the group of
hornblende-pyroxenites of Williams. When collected, these rocks were
supposed to be interstratified with the metamorphic series, as their
outcrops had the same general strike; the result of microscopical
examination indicates that they are probably altered intrusive sheets.

“The flat-topped ridge of mesa sandstones south of the ravine in
which the principal New Pedrara onyx deposits occur is thickly strewn
with subangular blocks of augite-andesite, which have apparently |
weathered out as the soft ash of which the beds are composed has
worn away. At the eastern extremity of this ridge, on the very crest
of the divide, is a high basalt-capped mesa, nearly a mile in diameter,
called by us Bluff Point. It has an elevation of about 3,500 feet, and
overtops all the highest summits within a radius of 15 to 20 miles, thus
offering an admirable point of view from which to study the physical
structure of the region. The basalt cap bas an aggregate thickness of
500 feet, and consists of an upper layer of dark vesicular olivine-
bearing rock 350 feet in thickness resting on 150 feet of gray, fine-
grained rock containing abundant large crystals of olivine. The upper
layer has a dark smoky glass base with the usual microlites of feldspar
and augite and small phenocrysts of augite, olivine, and feldspar.
Between these flows a zone of decomposition several feet in thickness,
colored brilliant red by peroxidation of the iron, makes a prominent
line, visible from a great distance, on the bluff faces which almost com-
pleteiy surround the mesa.

“The surface of the mesa has a gentle slope westward and ends to the
eastward in an almost perpendicular escarpment overlooking the Tule
arroyo 1,500 feet below, which has here widened out into a consider-
able valley that drains the northern slopes of the White range far to
the south. Beyond this valley, partly cutting off the view of the Gulf
of California, lies the group of dark rugged peaks of metamorphic
slates called the Volean Peak group, which the Tule arroyo almost
completely encircles in its circuitous course to the sea. Through the
gaps in this range can be distinguished the pale blue waters of the
Gulf of California and occasionally portions of the coast line, as well
as several of the group of small islands which lie a few miles off the
shore in this latitude, and whose abrupt outlines show them to be
probably projecting points of the buried metamorphic ranges.

“The arms of the interior valley, which lie to the south and west of
the Bluff Point mesa, have a floor of granite which is entirely denuded
986 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

of the mesa sandstone covering and of the lake beds, if the latter ever
covered it. The granite is alight gray rock of normal type, consisting
of two feldspars, quartz, and both white and brown mica. Hornblende
was not observed. From general appearance and association it would
appear to be a distinct and older rock than that found in the western
range. To the south of these valleys the White range, composed of
the same granite, stretches some 10 or 15 miles east and west across the
peninsula, and apparently cuts off in great measure the interior valley
in this direction. As no contacts were found, it was impossible to
determine the relative age of the granite and the metamorphic series.”

ITINERARY.

The party left San Quentin for El Rosario, some 40 miles to the
south, late on the afternoon of July 19, our conveyance consisting of a
‘dead ex” wagon drawn by a pair of mules. That night we succeeded
in making but about 7 to 9 miles, nearly the entire distance being over
level sand plains, either quite bare or covered with cacti, sage brush,
and in places with dense growths of strong-smelling shrubs with small
harsh leaves and thorny branches. We encamped that night, as indeed
every night, in the open air, and were on the road again by 6 o’clock
the morning following. For nearly 10 miles the route lay along the
hard sands of a beautiful beach facing the open Pacific. Thousands
upon thousands of dark-colored sea fowl flew back and forth in long
undulating lines, while small flocks of gulls, curlews, and an occasional
brace of strong-flying pelicans enlivened the monotony of the trip.
The sands were beautifully hard, clean, and white, with comparatively
few shells or other indications of marine life. The disk-like shells of
echinoderms, an occasional giant clam, and more rarely yet a few
abalones were the most conspicuous forms. But this part of the trip
was only too soon at an end, and leaving the beach we turned inland,
journeying for the rest of the day over a nearly level plain with high
mesa sands to the east. In the distance from San Quentin to El Rosa-
rio fresh water was found but twice, and though in some eases the soil
was good the lack of moisture leaves the country essentially a desert.
This indeed is the condition of affairs throughout the entire region
traversed, excepting where along the few streams a crude form of
irrigation by the native Mexicans was carried on. Along the beach
above alluded to the soils were light and sandy and bore no vegetation
of sufficient size or proper foliage for casting a shade. Such plants as
existed consisted mainly of cacti and small, nearly leafless, thorny
shrubs. Rarely the pole-like form of a giant cactus or an agave
appeared in the distance, but much more abundant were elongated,
serpent-like forms, 3 or 4 inches in diameter and of all lengths up to 10
or more feet, growing singly or in clusters.

A miserable variety of sage brush, with its half dead, half living,
scrawny branches, was everywhere, while an occasional small, tubular-
GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 987

shaped, very pretty pink flower showed up in strong contrast with
the general dreariness of the land. An ‘ice plant,” an insignificant
little thing growing close to the soil, of a green and wine red color,
covered all over with jelly-like drops or tubercles, added also a slight
amount of attractiveness, or at least gave interest to the scene. Small
lizards darted about, and an occasional quail, jack or cotton-tail rabbit,
a few butterflies, a large species of ichneumon fly, a few grasshoppers
(some species of Gidipoda), and a black yellow-spotted spider which
builds strong webs on the shrubs, were about all that was visible in
the way of animal and insect life, though in the soil, at the foot of the
shrubs, I found occasional empty spiral shells of a land mollusk, the
Helix stearnsiana of Gabb. After leaving San Quentin nothing what-
ever in the way of reptile life was seen, although immediately about
San Quentin a species of rattlesnake was said to be quite abundant.
Beyond Rosario, with the exception of quail and mountain sheep and
antelope well over to the east coast, no forms whatever of wild animals
were observed, and even the numerous burrows of small nocturnal
mammals, so abundant toward the north, were almost entirely lacking.
About dusk we reached the divide which marks the limit of the desert
here, and went rattling down the steep sandy slopes toward El Rosario
mission and the sluggish shallow stream of the same name, but digni-
fied in this country of arid wastes by the name of river.

We reached the bottom just about that hour when it is too dark to
see anything distinctly, to find a flat valley, perhaps a mile in width,
hedged in on either side by steep bluffs of bare friable sandstone, and
covered, where not cultivated, by a dense growth of greenish, pungent-
smelling, almost leafless shrubs and a few willows. The short twilight
came quickly to an end and left us lost, stuck in the sand in a dense
growth of brush, from whence we were finally extricated through the
aid of a Mexican, and about 9.30 p. m. found our way to an adobe hut,
where we spent the night.

Five o’clock the following morning, July 21, found us once more astir.
While the head of the party was making arrangements for pack and
saddle animals, I improved the opportunity to utilize notebook and
camera. El Rosario (Plate 2) consists of a few adobe huts scattered
for a mile or more along the nearly level plains bordering on the river.
From a historical standpoint its most interesting possession is the ruin
of an old Franciscan mission, such as were once so abundant through-
out the Mexican-Spanish possessions on this coast. The original build-
ings are now almost entirely obliterated, only portions of the thick,
massive adobe walls remaining standing. A small building of modern
construction now contains the altar, crude images of the saints which
resemble nothing more than grotesquely large wooden dolls, and
ancient vestments, such as have escaped destruction. Two bells, each
about 20 inches in height, are hung upon a T-shaped post made from
the knees and other timbers of a wrecked vessel. One of these bells
988 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

bears the date of 1784 and the other 1800. A few miles up the river
we saw in the distance ruins of an extensive series of buildings once
forming a part of the mission, but now given over to silence and the
basking lizard. In exploring these ruins and still others at San Fer-
nando, one could not but be impressed with the fact that, objectionable
as may have been the system from a purely political standpoint, as a
means of bettering the immediate condition of the people it was cer-
tainly preferable to anything since inaugurated. In the place of the
thriving villages of no mean size which here and there dotted the land
wherever was sufficient water for irrigation, of well-kept adobe houses
and ehurehes, vineyards, orchards of figs and peaches, of gardens and
fields of grain, are now scattering huts in midst of ill-kept gardens or
barren plains. Shiftlessness, squalor, desolation, and barrenness now
reign supreme, where once was thrift and apparent prosperity.

The buildings at El Rosario are, I believe, without exception, of
adobe—one-story affairs with thick walls and roofs of poles thatched
with straw or palm leaves, and with floors of stone or hard-trodden
dirt. The schoolroom of the village was built of poles standing against
the side of one of the adobe houses, and rudely interwoven with sugar
cane. In this I found a dozen or so little bright-eyed Mexicans under
the instruction of a male teacher whose years must have numbered at
least 60. During school hours each scholar studies aloud, and the con-
fusion produced can be imagined. Now one voice in its jabbering
monotone would prevail; and now another, now louder, now softer,
rising and falling in irregular cadences such as would shortly render
an Eastern teacher insane, but in the midst of all of which the Mexican
conducts his recitations and administers his punishments, corporeal and
otherwise, with a calmness and indifference that led me at times to
doubt his power of hearing at all. All about the houses is dirt and
sand; no lawns, walks, or roadways. In the yard, inclosed by adobe

‘walls and thorny poles of the fouquiera, were stretched lines, on
which are drying long strips of meat. On the flat below ran the irri-
gating ditches, where women were washing clothes, and which are
bordered with fine large fig trees full of ripe, purple fruit, and beyond
which are peach orchards and gardens.

Shortly after noon of the 21st our outfit was docu ready and we
mount and start, said outfit consisting of three horses, two mules, and
one burro for saddle purposes, and two pack mules to carry provisions
and camp utensils. The first 10 miles of our course lay due north up
the Rosario Valley, the river bed becoming shortly little else than a
dry ravine, with here and there an adobe house with the usual type of
occupants.

At the end of perhaps 10 miles we turned to the east up a lateral
canyon or arroyo toward the mountain range, at the foot of which, -by
the side of a diminutive muddy spring, we made our camp. The stream,
now dry, here enters a deep, steep-walled canyon, cut in granitic dio-

rite, which seems to form the main mass of the hills, though in the dry
stream bed are abundant bowlders of granite, diabase, and more rarely
liparite and andesite.

The next morning it was found that our animals, which had been
merely hobbled in order that they might browse on the mesquite, had
strayed so far that it was nearly 11 o’clock before we were once more
in the saddle. In the meantime, while engaged in pursuit of the ani-
mals, the camera was more than once brought into requisition, some of
the results being here reproduced in Plates 6 and 7. The giant cactus,
Cereus pringlei, Plate 6, is about 25 feet in height by 20 inches in diam-
eter at the butt.

Larger forms, perhaps 35 to 40 feet in height, occur, but this was
selected for photographing simply on account of its accessibility and
from its being in fruit, as shown in the knob-like execrescences near the
top. This fruit consists of a beautiful dark carmine pulp, with black
seeds, inclosed in an envelope or rind so beset with small needle-like
thorns that he who plucks needs fingers of brass. The appearance of
this pulp in that dry, hot region was tempting in the extreme, but the
realization disappointing, it being almost tasteless, and even failing to
quench the thirst. These awkward forms, resembling nothing more
than clustered mill logs standing on end, were quite abundant, though
widely scattered. Some were straight and limbless as saw logs; others
gave off three or four or more clumsy branches a few feet from the
ground, as shown in the illustration.

Another striking form seen here for the first time is the Fouquiera
columnaris shown in Plate 7, and which becomes more abundant on the
inland plateau. Although in greater dimensions, some 40 feet in height
and 15 to 18 inches in diameter at the base, these strange forms were
readily cut down with the back of my geological hammer, and showed
in cross section a structure not greatly unlike that of our ordinary
Eastern sunflower (Helianthus annuus Linneeus) in that they have a
thin exterior or rind of a greenish white color and an interior core of
white pith-like material.

The numerous branches, which are about the size of an ordinary lead
pencil, pass directly through the hard, woody rind into the pith. When
the plant dies, the limbs fall out, the pith shrinks away and decays,
leaving the trunks in the form of collapsed elongated cylinders full of
spirally-arranged perforations. These branches are very abundant, and
project uniformly in every direction, sometimes to a distance of 2 feet
ormore. They are stiff, harsh, and thorny, and it was found possible
to gain access to the trunk without seriously tearing the flesh only by
turning up one’s coat collar, putting on gloves, bowing the head, and
backing in. Even then the work of cutting through the bark is disa-
greeable, though the bark or rind is itself thin and tender.

A landscape of these pole-like forms, with their thorny branches and
few small, brittle, thick, yellow green leaves is weird in the extreme,
990 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

and particularly so about dusk. Dry, hot, leafless, noiseless, and appar-
ently lifeless, it conveys vividly to the imagination the idea of a burnt-
out world. (See Plates 3 and 8.)

The writer is informed by Chief Botanist F. V. Coville, of the
Department of Agriculture, that this plant was first described by Dr.
Albert Kellogg nearly forty years ago, under the name of [dria colum-
naris,! a new species of the family Fouquierace, the description being
based on specimens brought from Lower Gabieme by Doctor J. A.
Veatch. The validity of the species was afterwards questioned and the
plant doubtfully referred to Fouquiera spinosa, until in 1889 Mr. T. 8.
Brandegee fully established its distinctness from that species.’

As we ascended the mountains and passed the crest to the plateau
on the east, the country became, if possible, more and more forbidding.
The scanty soil and scattering growth of desert plants quite fail to
cover the rocks, which stand out bare and hot, weathered to a dull
reddish color. There is absolutely nothing that can cast a shade or

boast a thornless leaf. Yet there were beautiful and interesting things,
if one could but stop under that scorching sun, to admire. <A barrel-
shaped cactus from 6 inches to 4 feet in height, with long strong sharply
recurved thorns, shows delicate green and pink tints, and often has a
circle of beautiful deep scarlet flowers on the top. The agave begins
to appear; a little insignificant cluster of leaves growing on vertical
cliffs takes the form of a rose, and is coated with a flour-like bloom.
The tints are delicate greenish white, sometimes pinkish, and when one
ean rid himself of the idea that the whole country is accursed, he finds
it beautiful in the extreme.

We camped that night (the 22d) on the banks of a stream no longer
running, but yielding in standing pools sufficient water for our imme-
diate needs, passing on the way the only habitation seen between
Rosario and San Juan de Dios. Mesquite grew abundantly along the
dry bottoms, and there was a plentiful supply of quail, but no other
forms of animal life were seen. From this point to San Juan de Dios
the most striking feature of the landscape are the rounded, boss-like
forms of the hills, due to the weathering of the granular, massive dia-
bases and diorites of which they are composed. The region is one of
limited. rainfall, but subject to great diurnal changes of temperature.
The agents of disintegration are therefore heat and cold, and as a result
the débris from the massive eruptive rocks consists mainly of angular
fragments, each of the larger fragments consisting of an aggregate of
minerals, scarcely at all discolored by oxidation, and differing from the
parent rock only in their state of partial disaggregation. This gravel
and sand, disturbed but little by other than wind erosion, accumulates
on the slopes until the outcrops become largely buried in their own
debris and partake of the rounded character noted above. During the

day we passed over the landscape shown in Plate 8 and crossed a low
divide, where the ‘“‘lost mountain” type of structure, already described,
became first evident. The ground was covered with angular and
sharply-rounded pebbles of acid and basic eruptive rocks, interspersed
with thin crusts of lime carbonate, indicative of lake-bed deposits. A
small outcrop of hard, compact, reddish quartzite was passed a few
miles before San Juan de Dios, which place we reached about 3 p. m.
on the 23d.

A little stream makes up out of the rocks in a canyon, flows a short
distance, and sinks in the sand. Yet ’tis enough for human needs, and
here in his adobe hut, thatched with palm leaves, lives a Mexican rais-
ing cattle and children (Plate 4). We are given a hearty welcome, and
fed bountifully on stewed quail, beans, skim milk cheese, wild honey,
and the leathery tortilla, made from corn crushed on the aboriginal
metati.

The landscape here, except in the creek bottoms, retains its general
desert aspects. The flora is composed of various species of cactus,
among which the log-like cereus already mentioned is conspicuous.
The Fouquiera and agave also abound. The large tree shown is a cot-
tonwood, which I learned was not indigenous, but brought when a mere
slip from San Diego, California.

The hill shown is composed at its base of compact brecciated quartz
porphyry and diorite, capped by a light porous liparite. Small out-
crops of black basalt occur well up the slopes, which are covered by
bowlders rounded and waterworn of liparite and andesite.

The following morning (July 24) a general round-up was held, and
new animals obtained as far as possible, those obtained at Rosario
being already footsore. As the distance to the next water was estimated
at from 35 to 40 miles—a distance far too great for one day, over rough
trails and with unshod animals—it was decided to delay our start until
about noon, making a dry camp at night and finishing the trip the day
following. This was the programme finally carried out.

The first few miles of the route lay upward through narrow canyons
with steep, precipitous walls and loose, rocky bottoms, the slopes being
covered with bowlders of liparite, and the country rock consisting of a
loosely consolidated and irregularly bedded coarse gravel and bowlder
aggregate cemented by fine sand. Finally, emerging from the canyon,
or arroyo, we found ourselves on a high, level, liparite-topped plateau,
which extends for miles in a northerly and westerly direction. The
Agave shawii, with central stalk 10 to 15 feet in height, stand here by
the tens of thousands in full bloom in the midst of piles of rocks so hot
and forbidding that in spite of myself I drive by with scarcely a look.
These continue abundant well over toward the east coast and are often
beautifully symmetrical. For years these plants gather from the stingy
soil the necessary nutriment for the flower stalk, storing it up in their
thick, fleshy, bayonet-like leaves. When the season finally arrives,
hed

$92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

they shoot up in a surprisingly short space of time a single stalk,
sometimes 10 feet in height and 4 inches in diameter at the base, bear-
ing at the top a raceme of honey yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. As
the stalk shoots upward the leaves yield to it their stored-up juices,
shrivel, and die. Thousands of these were passed during the day, in all
stages of youth, maturity, and old age.

Continuing in a general easterly direction we soon reached the limit
of the plateau and plunged, by means of steep and often dangerous
trails, abruptly down several hundred feet where, for a distance of 20
miles or more, we traversed an undulating plain covered with sand and
loose bowlders, some rounded and others sharply angular, with lake-
bed exposures wherever the now dry water courses were cut to a suffi-
cient depth. The few antelope seen at a distance were the only signs
of animal life noted during the day. We camped that night (the 24th)
in the sand of a dry, shallow water course, resuming our journey at
3.30 the next morning. Sharply-serrated mountain peaks, suggestive
of volcanic cones, were seen in the distance, and about noon our plain
ends in a precipitous canyon cutting across heavy bedded, dense, blue
eray quartzites, which so strongly resemble limestones as to cause
them to be mistaken for this rock until they came to be tested in the
laboratory. In addition to this quarzite is a finely fissile, nearly black,
mica-schist, both rocks standing nearly on edge and with a strike some
20° west of north and south. A dikeof brecciated felsitic rock was also
noted. As the disintegration here, as farther to the west, is mainly
due to temperature changes, the schistose rocks weather into splintery
forms and the general topographic features may be described as ragged
in the extreme. The drainage from this point is toward the gulf,
through ravines, arroyos, and canyons innumerable.

We find water and make our camp on the afternoon of the 25th in
what is locally known as the Tule Arroyo, some 15 miles from the gulf
coast. Two insignificant little springs bubble up here in the dry bed
of the stream, furnishing, when first gathered, a pleasant sparkling
fluid so highly charged with carbonic acid as to resemble the soda water
of the drug stores. On standing, however, it soon lost its effervescent —
property and became so stale as to impart a decidedly disagreeable
taste even to the-coffee. Our first meal here consisted of stewed
potatoes and dark heavy Mexican bread, as tough and indigestible as
so much dried putty. Fortunately for us our Mexican guide went
down the arroyo toward the gulf and returned before night with the
carcasses of two mountain sheep, which kept us supplied with meat for
the remainder of the trip, the atmosphere being so dry that there was
no difficulty whatever in preserving it. The heat of the arroyo during
the day was intense. The high walls on either hand afforded shade
during the early morning and late afternoon, but during the middle
portion of the day life was only rendered tolerable to those who stayed

in camp by lying at full length in the sand under an immense mass of
rock that had fallen from the cliffs above.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY OF LOWER CALIFORNIA. 993

Aside from the ‘ tule,” a flag which, from the shape of its leaf and
the characteristic cylindrical spikelike form of its blossom and fruit, was
assumed to be the common “cat tail” (Typha latifolia) of the Eastern
States, and clusters of rushes, shown in the foreground of Plate 5, in
the bottom of the arroyo, there were on the slopes above numerous
cacti, one or more species of Spanish bayonet, the Fouquiera splendens,
and numerous agaves. The most striking of the floral forms, and one
which was seen here and only here, was the peculiar dwarf-like Veatehia
cedrocensis, or elephant wood (Plate 9). These were rarely more than
10 feet in height, though sometimes a foot or more in diameter at the
butt, and widely branching. Some of the smaller forms, but a foot or
so in height, enlarged abruptly into bulb-like forms, 3 or 4 inches in
diameter, on the immediate surface of the ground. The leaves and
yellow blossoms are small and inconspicuous, and scarcely show at all
in the rather poor photograph from which the accompanying engraving
was made.

The water from the springs above mentioned flows into depressions
in the rocky basin, forming pools, in which were found numerous water
beetles and one hemiptera, similar, so far as the writer could judge, to
the backswimming water boatman (Notonecta) of the Eastern ponds.
The water itself is sufficiently charged with carbonate of lime to deposit
a sinter on the surface over which it flows. During an earlier history
these springs, issuing from near-by vents, have built up large dome-
shaped masses of sinter, as shown in the left middle back group of
Plate 5. Before the arroyo was cut to its present depth, springs were
evidently more numerous, and tufa or travertine deposits of considera-
ble extent are found upon the adjoining slopes. <A large portion of this
material is of a dull brownish gray color, slightly compacted, cellular,
and of only geological interest. Occasional patches occur, however, of
the same material of a white color, or beautifully tinted and veined
with green and rose, and so compact as to acquire, in the hands of a
workman, a surface and polish like glass. It is, in short, the onyx
marble of commerce.!

Monday, July 27, the work of inspecting the onyx quarries in the
desert to the southeast having been completed, a start was made once
more for Rosario, though over for the most part a somewhat different
route. After leaving the canyon, or arroyo,.and the rocky divide, our
route lay over an undulating desert plain with flat-topped mesas on the
southeast and mountain peaks visible on all sides. A portion of the
plain was actually paved with basaltic fragments, though no basalt
flow in place was observed. The onyx beds, noted above, lie in some
cases like a pavement on the floor of the desert, the chief flora and
general character of the landscape being as shown in Plate 10. At the
end of the second day from the arroyo, i. e., Tuesday night, July 28, we

camped at San Fernando, now represented only by the ruined mission
and a few huts, occupied by Mexicans and their numerous progeny,
while twice the number of dogs and a million times as many fleas
served to fully sustain the national reputation.

The high mountain ridges at San Fernando are in part of compact
greenish quartz porphyry, sometimes so jointed as to resemble stratified
sedimentaries with gentle slopes toward the east and more precipitous
toward the west. Passing, next morning, northward and eastward of
San Fernando, the range from a slight distance shows highly tilted
stratified beds, and the landscape, with its pole-like Fouquiera, is weird
in the extreme, particularly about sundown. (See Plate 3.) For the
remainder of the journey the route lay over a region essentially iden-
tical with that already described, San Quentin being reached early in
the morning of July 31 in season to catch the fortnightly steamer for
San Diego.

THE MINERALOGICAL COLLECTIONS IN THE U.S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM.

By WIRT TASSIN.

Assistant Curator, Department of Minerals, U. S. National Museum.

A mineral collection in a public museum should present all of the
definite varieties of minerals occurring ready formed in nature, their
associations with other minerals, their occurrences, and finally their
chemical, morphological, and other physical features. It must meet
the needs of the chemist, the crystallographer, the physicist, the geolo-
gist, the petrographer, the student, and the observer who may desire
to obtain concise and specific information in any and all branches of
mineralogy, and finally it should be a university extension of the
broadest kind where one may secure a knowledge of minerals from
the cases with as little reference to the library as possible.

With these ends in view the mineralogical collections of the National
Museum are divided into three general series—the exhibition series,
the study series, and the duplicate series. The first of these, the exhi-
bition series, is primarily intended for the public and the student. It
is divided into two parts—the systematic series and the comparative

series.
THE SYSTEMATIC SERIES.

The systematic series treats of the properties of minerals in their
relations to the several kinds of minerals, and the description and sys-
tematic arrangement of the several species. Here will be found the
several representatives of the mineral kingdom, selected to illustrate
occurrence, association, color, and typical development. Here too are
to be found the rough and cut specimens of gems and ornamental
stones, the collection of meteoric bodies, and the “special locality”
collections illustrating certain regions in the United States where a
mineral or a series of minerals occur under noteworthy or special

conditions.

998 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT.

The systematic series is divided into two general classes—native
elements and compounds of the elements. The compounds of the ele-
ments are further divided and grouped under certain heads according
to, and which take their names from, their more negative constituents
as follows: Compounds of the halogens, fluorides, chlorides, bromides,
and iodides. Compounds of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; also
arsenic and antimony, including sulphides, selenides, and tellurides;
arsenides, antimonides, sulpharsenides, and sulphantimonides; also sul-
phosalts. Oxygen compounds, including oxides and the oxygen salts,
borates, aluminates, ferrites, chromites, manganites, uranates, carbon-
ates, silicates, titanates, columbates, tantalates, nitrates, vanadates,
phosphates, arsenates, antimonates, sulphates, chromates, tellurates,
molybdates, and tungstates. Compounds of organic origin, including
salts of organic acids and hydrocarbon compounds.

Each of these classes is further separated into groups, the minerals
included in any one group being such as are related in the minor
details of chemical composition and physical properties. Each of these
groups is preceded by a general group label giving the class to which
it belongs, the group name, the minerals composing that group together
with their chemical composition, system of crystallization, and a short
description of the occurrence, association, and characteristic form of
each member of the group. The following label will serve to give a
clearer idea of this arrangement:

TUNGSTATES.
Wolframite Group.
Wolframite, (Fe,Mn)W0O, Monoclinic.
Hiibnerite, MnwW0, Monoclinic.

Wolframite.—Chiefly ferrous tungstate, with some manganese. It occurs in irregu-
lar lamellar, coarse divergent columnar, and granular masses, and in crystals, com-
monly tabular. Color and streak nearly black. Wolframite is often associated
with tin ores, and with quartz carrying bismuth, scheelite, pyrite, galena, sphaler-
ite, ete.

Hiibnerite.—Chiefly manganese tungstate, with some iron. It occurs in bladed
forms and massive in quartz, and with alabandite, rhodonite, scheelite, fluorite, and
apatite. Color brownish red, hair brown to nearly black. Streak yellowish brown.

Following the group label, arranged in order from left to right, are
the several members of the group, selected to illustrate as completely
as possible their occurrences, associations, and variety in form and
color. Hach specimen is mounted upon a block, in front of which is a
small label giving the name of the species, the minerals associated
with it in that particular specimen, if any, its locality, catalogue num-
ber, and from whom and how received.

The several groups are placed in regular order in the cases, and each
case carries a case label giving the name of the class to which its con-
tents are referred. In the upper left-hand corner of each case is a
numeral followed by an arrow, which serves to indicate the sequence
MINERALOGICAL COLLECTIONS IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 999

in which the cases are to be studied, and also to facilitate reference to
the text of a descriptive catalogue soon to be printed.

The arrangement of the “special collections” is essentially the same,
except that in place of the group label there is a general descriptive
label applying to the entire case, as follows:

ZINC MINERALS OF NEW JERSEY.

Ores of zinc in workable quantities are found in New Jersey, at Franklin and
vicinity, Sussex County. The region is unique in that the deposit consists almost
entirely of a mixture of the oxides and anhydrous silicates of zinc. The ore depos-
its are in beds or veins that are conformable with the stratification of the rocks in
which they are embedded; they pitch to the northeast, they dip to the southeast,
and they liein a fold. The zine minerals occur in the gangue rock associated with
a variety of limestone carrying manganese, and with a manganese garnet. The run
of the mine is usually a mixture of franklinite, willemite, and zincite.

Franklinite is iron black in color, having a metallic luster, a hardness varying
from 5.5 to 6.5, and a specific gravity of 5. It is slightly magnetic, crystallizes in
regular octahedrons, and is also massive, granular to compact. It has the chemical
composition ZnFe,0,.

Willemite varies in color from apple green, flesh red, to manganese brown. Its
hardness is 5.5, specific gravity 4. It is rarely crystallized, occurring usually in
disseminated grains or masses. It has the chemical composition Zn.,SiO,.

Zincite is of a dark red color, occurring usually foliated massive, or in coarse par-
ticles or grains, sometimes having.a granular structure. Its hardness is about 4,
and it varies in specific gravity from 5.3 to 5.7. It has the chemical composition
ZnO.

THE COMPARATIVE SERIES.

The comparative series treats of the several characteristics or prop-
erties of any one mineral species as applied to all other mineral species.
This series is intended primarily for the student of mineralogy. Here
the properties of minerals are illustrated and defined. In each case
the label containing a definition of the property under consideration
precedes a series of specimens, and, wherever they can be used advan-
tageously, a series of models illustrating that property. One example,
that of “composition”, will serve to illustrate the methods used in this
series:

COMPOSITION.

All minerals are composed of either an element alone or two or more elements in
combination. Elements are said to combine when on bringing them together a new
substance is produced, differing from and possessing properties which, as a rule, are
not the mean of those of its constituents. For example, the gases hydrogen and
oxygen under the proper conditions combine to form water—a liquid. These combi-
nations are represented symbolically by the juxtaposition of the symbols of the
combining elements. Thus a molecule of water, composed of two atoms of hydrogen
and one of oxygen, is represented by the symbol H,0. The multiplication of a
group of atoms is denoted by placing the proper numeral to the left of the group of
symbols or by inclosing them in brackets and placing a small numeral at the right;
thus 3H,0 or (H,O); denotes three molecules of water. The combination of groups
is expressed by placing their symbols in juxtaposition with a dot between them;
thus Fe,0;.H.0 denotes a compound of oxide of iron with water. Sometimesa comma
or the sign -|- is used in place of the dot. Further, the letter R is used to denote a
varying group of equivalent elements; thus RCb.O; isa compound in which there is a
varying amount of the equivalent or isomorphic elements of the rare earths.
1000 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Following this label is a series of six typical elements with some of —
their native combinations. Each specimen is mounted on a block asin
the systematic series, in front of which is a small label giving the name,
composition, locality, etc., of the individual.

THE STUDY SERIES.

This series contains all that material which appeals exclusively to the
specialist. It is the source of the material from which new exhibition
series are built, or old ones strengthened. In it is placed all that mate-
rial which has been the source of investigations, or which it is thought
may be made the subject of research. It contains all those specimens
which serve to illustrate the occurrence and associations of a mineral
in any one locality that are not needed for the exhibition series, or which
are not unnecessary duplications of material already on hand.

Each specimen in this series is numbered, labeled, and placed in a
paper tray. The several specimens are then arranged geographically
by species; the species arranged in groups, as in the systematic series,
and placed in drawers. Each drawer contains but one species, and a
label giving the contents of that drawer is pasted in the upper left-hand
corner of its front.

This series also includes all the original and type material belonging
to the Department. These are brought together in a series of drawers
reserved for that purpose, and all of the type or original specimens
which are not needed to complete the exhibition series are here placed,
together with a copy of the original papers, or at least a reference to
them, and a bibliography in which the work has appeared. Those types
used in the exhibition series are here indicated by a card giving its
exact position in the cases.

THE DUPLICATE SERIES.

This series includes all that material not needed for the exhibition or
study series; and from it all exchanges, gifts, etc., are made up.

INSTALLATION,

The species and varieties of minerals—that is, the systematic
series—are arranged in forty-six slope front-floor cases. Beginning with
the first on the right, entering the hall from the north, the contents of
these cases are as follows: 1-2, native elements; 3-4, fluorides, chlorides,
bromides, and iodides; 5-9, sulphides, selenides, tellurides, arsenides,
antimonides, and sulphosalts; 9-16, oxides; 17, borates, aluminates,
chromites, ferrites, manganites; 18-22, carbonates; 23-37, silicates;
38, titanates, columbates, and tantalates; 39, nitrates and vanadates;
40-42, phosphates and arsenates; 43-45, sulphates; 46, chromates,
molybdates, tungstates, and uranates. The several special collections,
which may be recognized by their case labels, are contained in the cases
marked A, B, C, D, EH, F, ete., in the plan (Plate 1). The wall case W
on the west side of the hall contains the comparative series.

THE TONGUES OF BIRDS.

By FrREDERIC A. LUCAS,

Curator, Department of Comparative Anatomy, U. S. National Museum.

’

The tongues of birds have been not exactly overlooked, but some-
what neglected, by ornithologists, and it is the object of this paper to
note a few of their interesting features and to call attention to some
of the problems connected with them, in the hope that our younger
ornithologists may devote some time to their study. The collecting of
skins is undoubtedly the most attractive form of ornithological work,
and I do not wish to be looked upon as in anyway disparaging this
branch of ornithology with its bearing on the questions of individual
variation, color changes, geographical distribution, and the like; but
there are so many points on which general deductions can only be
made through the patient accumulation and careful sifting of facts
that it seems at least unfortunate that more attention is not paid to
them by those who have the leisure todo so. It is an easy matter for
anyone engaged in collecting skins to gather abundant material for
the study of tongues,! and it seems a pity that so many good speci-
mens should have been wasted when they could so readily have been
preserved.

While the tongue is so intimately related to the beak, there is less
unity of purpose between them than might at first sight be supposed,
and the size or shape of the one is no criterion as to the size or shape
of the other. The beak of a bird serves the purpose of a hand.
With it he chips the shell and introduces himself to the world; with
the beak the bird gathers its food, preens its feathers, builds a nest.
He may use it, like the parrots, in climbing, or, like the Carolina parra-
keet, may even hang himself up to sleep on the inside of a hollow stump.
It would sound well to continue the simile, and say that as the bird’s
beak is a hand, so the tongue is a finger; but the true and the beauti-
ful are by no means as synonymous as one might wish, and all that
can be truthfully said is that sometimes, or to some extent, the tongue

'Thus, my friends, Messrs. William Palmer, E.J. Brown, and the late R.S. Mat-

thews, while collecting the birds of Washington and the vicinity, have supplied me

with a large amount of material, all the more valuable because it was quite fresh,

plays the réle of a finger. This use of the tongue may be very evi-
dent as when a parrot manipulates a nut, turning it about with the
tongue while holding it between the mandibles, and it seems quite
evident, too, that many graminivorous birds, like the crossbill and
goldfinch, must use their tongues in a similar manner to extract seeds.
But if not used as a finger, the indications are that the tongue does.
play an important part either in obtaining food or in its subsequent

manipulation. As there are very many things still to be learned
regarding the food of birds, and as we can seldom watch them closely
in their native wilds, it is in the majority of cases impossible to directly
prove the relation between the food and the tongue. If positive evi-
dence is lacking, however, circumstantial evidence is plentiful, and
there are numerous cases where it is difficult to account for the shape
of the tongue, if it does not have a direct bearing on the question of
food.

Before passing on to a consideration of the tongue, it will be well to
look at the bones which support and form a part of it, for these have
THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1005

to do not only to some extent with the shape of the tongue, but on
them depends the power of movement, of extending and retracting the
tongue, and the ability to suck up the nectar of flowers. These little
bones (fig. 1 a), when all are present, are eight in number, the three
foremost corresponding to the hyoid, the five hindmost to the first gill
arch, of a fish. The shape of these may vary somewhat, the proportions
much more, but, after all, the differences between them are not very
great. The tongue is attached principally to the two foremost bones,
while the others are mainly concerned with the motions of the tongue,
furnishing attachment for the muscles by which it is protruded and
retracted, as well as serving as guides to make the apparatus run true.
The varying proportions of the bones tell something of the importance
of the tongue and something of its use. If the foremost bones are
well developed, then the .tongue is thick and fleshy, as in the duck,
and has considerable to do in obtaining or manipulating food (fig. 1 ¢).
If the foremost bones are small, or are represented by cartilage, then
the tongue plays an insignificant part, as in the cassowary, or is a mere
rudiment, as in the cormorant and pelican (fig. 1b). If the hindmost
bones are long, the tongue is protruded in getting food, and the length
of these bones is a direct measure of the extent to which the tongue
can be extendea. The proportions of the intermediate bones, the
ceratobranchials, have to do with the length of the bill.

The hyoid probably has a more direct relation to the tongue in birds
than in any other group of vertebrates. Among mammals the most
important office of the hyoid is to support the larynx, and this duty it
often performs very effectively. In reptiles the hyoid has much to do
with breathing, and in turtles, whose ribs are so tied up as to be of no
use in respiration, the hyoid may be seen working backward and for-
ward, forcing air into the lungs. The hyoid of frogs is mostly orna-
mental, being a hint that the tadpole had an elaborate and well-
developed system of gills, which was put off together with the tail. In
fishes the hyoid forms a firm support to the gill arches, although it also
supports the tongue. In birds the two ceratohyals, or glossohyals, as
they are sometimes called from their intimate connection with the
tongue, are embedded in the tongue and usually terminate in cartilages
which are prolonged for some distance forward well toward the tip
of the tongue. Their posterior portions end in the main posterior
points of the tongue (fig. 1 a).

There is an intimate relation between the dermis and the epidermal
layer of the tongue, and if a thin tongue is held up to the light, the little
blood vessels may be readily seen running into the harder portion. At
the same time, if a tongue is allowed to macerate for a little, the con-
nection between the dermis and epidermis is easily broken down and
the horny external layer may be slipped off as a glove is drawn from
a finger.

A very curious thing happens in the titmice—to be exact, this is
1006 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

known to happen in Parus carolinensis, the only species in which I
have examined the young and traced the growth of the tongue; but the
tongues in this group are so similar that I have ventured to generalize
from an observation, which is, I admit, a very bad practice—where the
epidermal sheath of the tongue is perforated in front, allowing the
cartilaginous anterior portions of the ceratohyals to project through.
The smallest and simplest style of tongue is found in some of the
fish-eating birds, those which, like the cormorant and pelican, gulp
down their food whole, and here tongue and hyoid are mostly, or
entirely, in the soft pouch. Flesh-eaters, too, have comparatively sim-
ple tongues, and so have many of our little song birds, such as the
thrushes; and as this type of tongue is the ground plan on which much
more complicated tongues are found, it will serve as a good starting
point. The tongue of the robin is rather thin and horny, somewhat
thicker toward the base, or hinder portion, slightly split or feathered
at the tip, and provided at the back with a row of fleshy backwardly-
directed spines. With the
exception of these spines,

y) less feathered at the tip, may
: /, be called the typical pattern
for thrushes, warblers, and
the great host of our North
American birds. An almost endless number of tongues may be derived
from this simple pattern by slight changes in proportions, amount of
curvature, number of posterior points, and extent of feathering. Trim
oft the tip a little and curl up the edges, and we have the tongue of a
Shore lark (Plate 1, fig. 12); lengthen the tongue and feather it more at
the tip, and we have the tongue of a rusty blackbird, and between these
two we have noend of varieties. Still, among all these there is no special
modification hinting at adaptation to some particular kind of food, for
most of our small birds have considerable latitude in the way of diet.
Not. only is there much specifie variation in birds’ tongues, but there
is also a considerable amount of individual variation in the degree of
feathering or whipping out of the tip. Part of this is due to wear, for
some birds, like some people, appear to use their tongues more than
others, with a consequent loss of the delicate fringing at the tip, but
part of it is due to natural variation, for the unworn tongues of two
birds of the same species may have a very different aspect. Whether
or not the outer sheath of the tongue is molted, as some birds shed

and renew the horny covering of their beaks, is not known to me, but
if this is not the case, the growth of the tongue must be comparatively
rapid to prevent it from being worn to the quick.

The tongues of the North American honeycreepers of the genus
Certhiola are an elaboration of the warbler type, being finer and more
complicated in detail, long and slender, much hollowed out toward the
tip, deeply cleft, and decorated with long incurved featherings. An
Australian honeysucker, Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris, carries the fining
down of parts to an extreme, having a delicacy of structure which
can be appreciated only with a glass. The tongue of still another
genus of North American honeycreepers, Coereba (fig. 3 ¢), differs
trom those just described in the matter of detail by splitting the tongue

more deeply and increasing the length of the feathering which rolls
inward from either edge so that the tongue ends in two spiral brushes
of extreme delicacy. The Hawaiian and Australian honeysuckers
show a still farther advance on this, for in them each of the main
branches of the tongue is cleft in twain, and these may again bifurcate
so that the tongue ends in four or eight small spiral brushes. By a
very little modification a true suctorial tongue, such as that of the sun-
birds, Cinnyris, or of the genus Hemignathus (fig. 3 b), may be derived
from that of the warbler type. If, instead of splitting and feathering
the tip, the edges of the tongue are rolled upward and inward until
they meet, a tube will be formed, and this tubular tongue, as well as
the others, is subject to various modifications and may become quite
complicated. In the sunbirds the edges simply touch each other and
1008 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

the tube 1s single; in Vestiaria the edges pass by and the tube becomes
triple, while by division it may terminate in two or four tubes, as the
case may be.

The real effectiveness of a tubular tongue depends not only on the
tongue itself, but on the action of the hyoid and its controlling muscles,
just as the usefulness of a pump does not lie in the pipe, but in the
valves. The manner in which suction is effected has been well
described by Doctor Gadow,! and is, in substance, as follows: By the
contraction of the mylo and serpio hyoid muscles which underlie the
tongue, that organ, together with the larynx, is pressed up against the
roof of the mouth. The tongue is then protruded and the larynx and
back part of the tongue depressed, thus creating a vacuum between
tongue and palate, and into this vacuum will flow any liquid into which’
the tip of the tongue may have been inserted. The fringing of the
tip of the tongue, or its conversion into a spiral brush, causes liquid to

ascend to the tubular portion of the tongue by capillary attraction, and
thus overcomes any tendency of air to enter the tongue and prevent
suction.

If we go back to what we may call the primitive pattern of tongue
and make the upper surface thick and fleshy instead of thin and horny,
we will have such a tongue as characterizes many, if not the majority,
of seed-eating birds, while between the two come such tongues as those
of the swifts and swallows, owls and goatsuckers. The amount of vari-
ation in these last-named groups is not great, and there is no wide
departure from what may be termed the standard pattern. The tongues
of the titmice and nuthatches may either be looked upon as modifica-
tions of the sparrow type, or as having a pattern of their own. Those
of the titmice (Plate 1, fig. 14) suggest a four-tined pitchfork, and can
be better understood from the figure than from any description. Those

'Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1883, pp. 62-69.
THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1009

of the nuthatches, while constructed on the same plan as those of the
titmice, are more complicated, and resemble a series of rods placed side
by side.
The tongues of swifts and swallows (Plate 1, figs. 1-3), just referred to,
may be called typical insectivorous tongues, since they are found in birds
whose food consists largely, if not entirely, of insects.
' This style of tongue is slightly fleshy, but not so
thick as in the seed eaters, and in a great many
species bears, toward the base, numerous papille,
while in others papille are distributed more or less
regularly over the tongue. These may be small and
blunt, or they may assume the form of spines; in any
case their object appears to be to work food backward
toward the gullet. Furthermore there is often a plen-
teous supply of sharp backwardly directed points about
the glottis, all to the end that food may glide safely
past the windpipe. The tongues
of owls (Plate 2, fig. 5), while hav-
ing an individuality of their own,
are intermediate between those
of the goatsuckers and the diurnal birds of prey,
being rather fleshy and armed with small spines
on the posterior half. In some birds of prey there

‘is a system of large pores opening on the base of
the tongue, and in advance of the glottis.

Many water birds, such as gulls, sandpipers,
rails, and herons, may also be said to have simple
tongues, and so do at least some of the pigeons
and fowls. From their simplicity it would seem
that the tongues of these birds do not play an im-
portant part, unless, indeed, the slender tongues
of some of the snipe family have a delicate sense
of touch which enables them to discriminate in
the matter of food, and this, from the horny con-
dition of the tip, seems rather improbable.

There are other types of tongues found in other
groups of birds, while there are many birds whose

tongue (Plate 2, fig. 12), long and slender, deeply cleft, with each slender
branch bordered with a delicate inrolled membrane, which gives the

front half of the tongue the character of a double tube.'| The base of
the tongue is formed by the soft, fatty, fibrous envelope of the basihyal,
which stretches like a mass of india rubber when the tongue is pro-
truded, and, like rubber, contracts when the tongue is retracted.
Immediately in front of this is the dense cartilaginous sheath of the
ceratohyals, forming the bulk of the tongue and practically consisting
of two portions—that investing the bony part of the ceratohyals and
that surrounding their cartilaginous prolongations. The difference
between the character of the epidermis of these two parts is such that
in badly preserved or slightly macerated specimens the anterior part
may be slipped off intact. If this is done, it will be found to be a
hollow tube of cartilage, grooved along the middle above and below,
and slightly grooved along the upper, outer surface. This tube is soon
divided by a vertical partition, while a little more than halfway
between base and tip the tongue forks, each branch continuing hollow
for some distance. A fold, or flange, commences near the base of the
tongue, on either side, and continues to the tip, growing wider and

thinner as it proceeds, until along the branches it becomes a very deli-
cate membrane. As previously stated, it is these two membranous
portions which become rolled into tubes, and when the tongue of the
humming bird is spoken of as being tubular, it is these branches which
are meant. To say that the tongue consists of two parallel muscular
tubes is quite erroneous, as is the statement that the tubular portion of
the tongue is drawn back into a muscular sheath. It seems a little
doubtful if the tongue of the humming bird can be a true suctorial
tongue, for the tubes formed by the anterior part of the tongue are not
long enough to reach the back of the mouth, neither are they tight
along the edges, although, owing to their small size, liquid would
undoubtedly rise in them by capillary attraction. Gosse, who observed
these birds in confinement, seems to furnish the elue to the action of

of humming birds’ tongues, unaccompanied by good explanatory figures, and it has

been vigorously asserted, and quite as vigorously denied, that the tongue of the
humming bird was hollow, or tubular.

the tongue when he says that in drinking sirup the tongue is protruded
for half an inch or so and worked rapidly backward and forward. In
doing this the tip of the tongue would naturally fill with sirup when
protruded, and when the tongue was retracted it would ‘either be
brought far enough back for a vacuum to be formed at the base or
liquid could be forced out by pressing the tip against the roof of the
mouth as the tongue was
again extended.

The tongues of wood-
peckers (Plate 2, figs. 8,
9), so far as they have
been observed, are con-
structed on one plan,
being long, slender, and
pointed, round or ellipti-
eal in cross section,
slightly barbed on either
side at the tip, and with
the upper surface cov-
ered with backwardly
directed spines so min-
ute that it needs a mag-
nifying glass to properly
appreciate them (fig. 7).
There are no spines at
the base of the tongue
itself, as in most birds,
for the tongue, when re-
tracted, is withdrawn
into a sheath, or makes
its own sheath, as when
a gloved finger is drawn
back and the glove
doubles upon itself. In
most species the tongue
is very extensile—the
sapsuckers (Sphyrapi-
cus) are exceptions—
and since, as said in the beginning. the extensibility of the tongue
depends on the length of the epibranchials, we find that these are very
long, in most cases even longer than the head. Such being the ease,
some special provision has to be made for disposing of the hyoid when
the tongue is retracted, and this provision is obtained as follows: The
two branches of the hyoid pass up over the back of the skull, coming
together at the top, and then (usually) turn to the right and continue
onward over the forehead, onward beneath the nostril into the beak,
and thence quite to the tip. Still another method is found in some

individuals where the ends of the hyoid curl about the eyeball instead
of dipping into the beak, but this is found less often than the other.
The tongues of some species—the flicker, for example—have but one or
two barbs at the tip, others have half a dozen, and still others twenty
to thirty, the barbs becoming finer as they become more numerous.
Finally, in the sapsucker the barbs have degenerated into stiff hairs,
which, instead of raking backwards, stand out from the side like the
bristles on a chimney cleaner.

It is interesting to note the modifications
by which the hyoid is made effective as a
probe, or spear, since for this last purpose it
should be as rigid as possible. The two fore-
most pieces of the hyoid are much reduced

of the spear is partly formed by the long
and slender basihyal and partly by the two
ceratobranchials, which are brought close
together when the tongue is protruded.
These last are attached directly to the rear
of the basihyal—an arrangement which in-
creases the power of the thrust. (See fig. 1 e.)

may be only three or four of these teeth
toward the base of the tongue, as in the ring-
necked duck (fig. 8a), or they may preponderate, as in the Canada goose,
a species 1n which they reach the maximum of development, the tongue
being armed on either side with a row of saw-like teeth. Finally, there
may be no teeth at all, as in the hooded merganser (fig. 8 b), whose slen-
der, gutter-shaped tongue bears on its edges only a series of bristles
pointing obliquely upward. Ordinarily they point obliquely downward,
suggesting a straw-thatched roof, but in any case their apparent func-
tion is that of a strainer to aid in securing food.
THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1013

Other types of tongues are doubtless found in other groups of birds,
but whatever the general plan on which the tongue is built, the varia-
tions in the execution of details appear to be almost infinite in num-
ber, as if nature had striven to have no two tongues exactly alike.

It is a question of interest to ornithologists whether the tongues of
birds are modified according to the nature of the food, or whether,
underlying all modifications, are certain definite plans of structure
indicative of relationship. If the tongues of birds do bear a direct
relationship to the character of the food, or the manner in whieh it is
taken, we should not be surprised to find that birds which are only dis-
tantly related have very similar tongues, provided their food or feeding
habits were similar, while near relatives might be very different in this
respect. We should also be able in many cases to see the connection
between the shape of the tongue and the character of the food. On
the other hand, if the tongue is of any value in classification, it should
be possible to tell something of a bird’s affinities from an examination
of the tongue. Theoretically, too, we would suppose that the less the
tongue was used the smaller the probability of its being adaptively
modified, and that the chances of finding a likeness between the tongues
of the various members of a group ought to be greatest in a group in
which the tongue played an unimportant part in getting or manipulat-
ing food. Conversely, differences between the tongues of nearly related
species might be expected if those species used their tongues, while the
greater the similarity between the two species in the manner of obtain-
ing food the greater would be the chances of finding their tongues
modified in the same manner, although small differences might be
expected since the chance of absolute identity would be small.

To make a fair test of the correctness or incorrectness of these propo-
sitions, we should compare nearly related species with entirely different
food habits, or very distinct species with similar food habits.

Were we to be guided by the members of a group like the humming
birds, we would at once say that the tongues did have a decided value
in Classification, since we find that all these little birds have the same
style of tongue. ‘To offset this, we have the fact that the humming
birds have all practically the same habits, eat the same kind of food,
and take it in the same manner, so that really they throw no light on
the subject. The penguins present an analogous case, for while the
tongues of all are strikingly similar to one another, the habits and food
of all are also similar.

The tongues of woodpeckers, at least those of our North American
species, can readily be distinguished as such, although they differ con-
siderably from one another in length and in the amount and character
of the barbing at the tip. It is an easy matter to follow, step by step,
the changes by which the sharp barbed tongue of the pileated wood-
pecker is converted into the brushy tongue of the sapsucker, and as
we pass from species to species we can see the barbs becoming more
1014 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

numerous, longer, and more slender, changing from barbs to bristles
and from bristles to hairs, until the transformation is complete and the
spear has become a brush;'! or, if we strip off the adaptive disguises, we
will find that the hyoid, whether long or short, is constructed on the
same plan, and may see at a glance that Ceophlaus and Sphyrapicus
are akin to one another. At the same time it is an equally easy matter
to tell considerable of the food and habits of a woodpecker from the
tongue, to make a guess as to the probable preference of the species for
animal or vegetable food, and to say whether it spears grubs, eats
insects, or probes after ants. Here the tongue apparently points two
ways, not only indicating relationship, but
more than hinting at the dietary habits of its
possessor.

The tongues of the swifts have a very close
resemblance to one another, so do those of the
swallows (Plate 1, figs. 1-3), and the two groups
are so much alike in this respect that it is
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to tell
them apart. Now externally swifts and swal-
lows are very much alike, their food and the
mode of taking it is identical, and yet struc-
turally the two are widely separated, ptery-
losis, skeleton, muscles, alimentary canal, all
being different. Here, then, if we followed the
tongue, we should be at sea, and in this case
we may feel pretty safe in saying that the
resemblances between the tongues of swifts
and swallows are due to the influence of food.
The case may be further strengthened by show-
ing that birds not very closely related to either
swift or swallow resemble them in the general
style of their tongues, and this is true of at least the cedar bird and one
of the trogons (Plate 1, figs. 4 and 5), Priotelus, while further examina-
tion will probably bring to light further resemblances.

The owls furnish good examples of similarity of tongues arising from,
or at least correlated with, similarity in habits, for the genera Megas-
cops, Asio, Nyctea, Speotyto, and Strix have tongues built on the same
plan, the main difference being that Strix, which is a long-faced bird,
has a long tongue. It might perhaps be assumed that because the
beak was long the tongue would of necessity be long also, but this by
no means follows, for the short tongues of the long-billed kingfishers
warn us that there is no necessity in the case at all, and that the length
of the bill is no index to the length of the tongue.

The opposite state of affairs, differences among related birds, is well

THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1015

Shown in certain finches where members of the same genus even may
have quite different tongues, although the direct connection between
these differences and the character of the food may not be evident.
The tongues of the several species of the genus Spinus, shown on Plate
2, figs. 6-10, although constructed on the same general plan, offer con-
siderable differences of detail, our common goldfinch, Spinus tristis,
being the most highly specialized. The members of the genus Melo-
spiza differ even more among themselves, and while Lincoln’s sparrow,
M., Uincolni, may have the tip of the tongue perfectly simple, the song
sparrow, M. fasciata, has the tip quite elaborately fringed. So common
a bird as the English sparrow has an aristocratically unique tongue,
quite unlike that of any of his relatives on this side of the Atlantic,
and still other finches might be adduced to show how great is the range
of form in this family.!

The hooded and the red-breasted mergansers are quite different from
each other in their tongues, and yet, so far as we know, there is not
sufficient difference in the nature of their food to account for this dis-
crepancy ; neither does the fact that they have been deemed sufficiently
far apart to be placed in two distinct genera signify, for the swifts and
swallows show that birds belonging in different suborders even may
have very similar tongues.

The reasons for the modifications of the tongue of the red-breasted
merganser are evident; the two rows of sharp, reverted spines on the
tongue, which are more nearly teeth than are the serrations of the bill,
are to help the bill in catching and swallowing small fishes, while the
feathering of the edge may be to aid in capturing still smaller fry,
although it is quite as probable a hint of affinity with the other ducks.
The tongue of the hooded merganser, which is like that of a duck
reversed, is a puzzle whose solution calls for a better knowledge of the
food and habits of the bird.

Finally, not to needlessly multiply instances of differences between
the tongues of related species, it may be said that while the petrels
have much similarity in food and habits they differ very materially in
the matter of tongues.

It is next in order to produce circumstantial evidence in the shape of
tongues whose peculiarities can be apparently explained by the char-
acter of the food or known habits of feeding, in order to demonstrate
the close relations between the two. The number of evident adapta-
tions would undoubtedly be very much increased could we observe
birds more closely in their native state, for we might then see the rela-
tion some curious tongue bore to some special kind of food, or catch
the particular trick of manipulation for which it was adapted.

Most insectivorous birds swallow their prey without any special
manipulation, and this, to a great extent, is true of the fruit eaters.

XIII, No. 2, April, 1896, pp. 109-115.
1016 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Graminivorous birds either need, or find it advantageous to have, some
special device for getting seeds or for husking them before they are swal-
lowed, and these have fleshy tongues, which, together with the char-
acter of the tip, must enable them to hold seeds well while removing
the husk. Apparently the delicacy of the tongue is no direct criterion
of the quality of the work done by it, for the cow bunting, which cleans
small seeds most dexterously, is by no means remarkable for the char-
acter of its tongue, and, on the other hand, it is not easy to see why the
song sparrow should have a tongue so finely fringed at the tip.

Such scoop-like tongues as those of the cross-bill and goldfinch (Plate
1, figs. 6 and 11) seem to bear a direct relation to the procuring of food
and to be specially designed for extracting seeds. Were thistles in
seed the year around, the tongue of Spinus tristis would be a clear case
of adaptation, for it appears admirably fitted either for gathering thistle
seeds or for removing the husks after they are gathered. However, Mr.
Palmer tells me that the gullet of the goldfinch often contains finely-com-
minuted food, almost in the condition of dough, and the tongue is very
likely the instrument by which this state is brought about. Knowing
that the shore lark feeds largely on small grass seeds, the tongue is seen
to be a nice little scoop for collecting them, while the miniature piteh-
forks of the titmice (Plate 1, fig. 14) are equally good instruments for
picking spiders, eggs of insects, and similar food, out of the crevices
into which these little birds are perpetually prying, although it would
apparently be more efficient could it be protruded farther.

The brush-tongued birds, the South American Coerebide and the
honeysuckers of the Sandwich Islands and Australia, are good exam-
ples of similarity of tongue structure in very different birds due to
adaptation for a certain kind of food or method of obtaining it. These
birds frequent flowering trees, either for the nectar of the blossoms or
for the insects which lurk therein, or for both, and their tongues are
all more or less extensile, and brushy at the tip. Whether the liquid
is actually sucked up or whether it is dipped up by the tongue tip as
by a swab, the result attained is the same.

Some of the brash-tongued birds certainly eat insects and spiders,
but the tongue would seem to be as well adapted for sweeping up these
as for sucking up Sweets. Moreover, it should be remembered that a
tongue may be a special adaptation for a given kind of food, procured
at certain seasons of the year, and therefore specially desirable only
for a short time. Or a bird may prefer a particular kind of food, and
yet eat something else when that is not to be had, just as the hairy
and downy woodpeckers have tongues specially adapted for spearing
grubs, and stili eat beechnuts. We know that humming birds are
fond of sweets, and we are equally certain that the bulk of their food
consists of insects,! and if they dine on one and make their dessert of the

‘Lucas, Frederic A. The Food of Humming Birds. The Auk, X, No. 4, October,
1893, pp. 311-315. ;
THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1017

other, the adaptive features of the tongue can still be accounted for.
So the fact that the honeycreepers eat berries and the honeysuckers
and sunbirds spiders and insects does not disprove the primary adap-
tation of their tongues for getting nectar. At the same time it is to
be noted that tubular and brushy tongues oceur only (?)
in birds of tropical or subtropical regions, where flowers
are to be found throughout a great part of the year.
The woodpeckers afford a good illustration of the
modifications of the tongue according to the nature of
the food, for in this group each variation in the tongue
appears to be accompanied by a corresponding varia-
tion in the general character of the
food.! The flicker has fewer barbs
on its tongue than any other species;
also it has one of the longest tongues
and the largest salivary glands. Now,
the flicker eats more ants than any
other species, these insects constitut-
ing about forty per cent of its food,
and it not only obtains them from the
surface of the ground but by probing 2
for them in anthills. The three-toed = | ‘
woodpecker heads the list of eatersof |
grubs, and this bird has, in addition [
to a long and fairly well barbed
tongue, an unusually good bill for |
cutting into trees; in fact, it may be \
said that the two go together, for
similar conditions are found in other
species. The little downy woodpecker comes next as
a destroyer of wood-boring larve, unless it should be
exceeded by the great pileated woodpecker, with its
powerful beak and sharp tongue. The sapsucker
seems to eat no boring grubs, but as an ant-eater it
stands next the flicker, the contents of its stomach
averaging thirty-six per cent of ants. It is, as its
popular name implies, a drinker of the sap of sweet
trees, and it also preys upon the flies and otherinsects
which are attracted by theexuding sap. The brushy
tongue (fig. 11) is well adapted for procuring such
articles in the bill of fare, but it is quite useless for extracting grubs from
their hiding places, being barbless and capable of but little extension.
The red-headed woodpeckers, although possessed of very extensile
tongues, have these organs rather feebly barbed, while they also have

pointed, little compressed beaks, not well adapted for cutting into wood,
and the members of the genus Melanerpes are seemingly more fond of
fruit than are any other species, and they are the most omnivorous
of the North American woodpeckers.

In all these cases the relation between form and food is plain, but
there are many others in which peculiarities of the tongue imply modi-
fication for some special end without that end being obvious. Such is
the case with the penguins, whose curious spiny tongues (fig. 12) must
play some definite part in their domestic economy, but whether modified
for the catching of fish, crustaceans, or squids is not quite clear,
although such tongues would seem to be well adapted for catching
small crustaceans.

The tongues of our American vultures too should have some bear-
ing on their diet, and possibly their hollow shape and roughened edges
are for the purpose of rasping meat from bones, although it may be
that. the adaptation is to quite a different end. The long, slender,
feathery tongues of toucans present another riddle which can only be
answered by one having full knowledge of their habits, although it
certainly seems a curious adjunct to the stout beak with which it is
associated.

From what has been said above it will be seen that, in a large num-
ber of cases, there is certainly a clear relation between the shape of the
tongue and the character of the food; that some closely related birds
differ as to their tongues while distant relatives present similarities
that seem to be connected with similarities in their food, and that, on
the whole, the modifications of the tongue-appear to be adaptive and
do not offer characters that can be safely used in classification.

A final point, deserving of study, is that of the changes which take
place during growth and the rapidity with which they are performed.
As is well known, the bills of long-beaked birds are acquired after
hatching, and long tongues grow in a like manner, such a slender, exten-
sile tongue as that of the humming bird being developed between the
time the young emerges from the egg and the date of quitting the
nest. The first indication of the long branches into which the tongue
is ultimately divided consists of a little notch in the tip, while there is
only the merest rudiment of the membrane which is to border these
branches (Plate 2, figs. 10-13).

The growth of the tongue, and of the hyoid as well, must be quite
as rapid in woodpeckers as in humming birds, for in a full-fledged
nestling of the downy woodpecker, a species which is provided with
one of the longest of tongues when adult, the hyoid barely reached
to the center of the skull, between the eyes. The same specimen
showed also that the barbs at the tip of the tongue are developed com-
paratively late, for the only trace of spines in this bird, which would
have soon quitted the nest, was a number of reflexed hairs represent-
ing the upper series on the tongue of the sapsucker. It seems prob-
THE TONGUES OF BIRDS. 1019

able that the barbs make their appearance at, or shortly after, the time
the bird leaves the nest, when the young cease to be fed and begin to
feed themselves, but a little positive evidence in the shape of speci-
mens is needed to settle the question.

In birds with shorter tongues than those just described the changes
during growth are, naturally, not so marked; but even in tongues like
those of the chimney swift and screech owl there is a very obvious
difference between the tongue of the embryo, or nestling, and that of
the adult.

The question of growth with its change of form connected with
change of food, or in the manner of getting it, is worthy of careful con-
sideration, but perhaps the most interesting Droulen presented by the
tongues 5 birds is whether underlying the infinite modifications of
the tongue are certain definite forms which may be of use in classifica-
tion, or whether these forms are all cases of adaptation to particular
kinds of food.

The evidence seems to point plainly in the latter direction, but what
is needed is a large collection of carefully sifted and assorted facts.

U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

THE ONTONAGON COPPER BOWLDER IN THE U.S. NATIONAL
MUSEUM.

By CHARLES Moore.

In a corner of the National Museum a bowlder of native copper,
weighing perhaps three tons, rests upon a plain wooden base. Trans-
ferred to the Museum from the Patent Office, in 1858, the copper frag-
ment was accompanied by no records, and this paper has been written
with the view of tracing the intricate but interesting story of the once
celebrated Ontonagon bowlder.

Worsbhipped as a manitou by the Hanan Indians during
uncounted years, the siren of mining adventurers while yet the flag
of England floated over the Lake Country, the objective point of haz-
ardous expeditions by explorer and scientist, the Ontonagon bowlder
has never been so left to itself as it has been during the half century
that has elapsed since it was brought to the national capital, where
the expectation was that all eyes might gaze upon it as the represent-
ative of national wealth and enterprise.

About the middle of the seventeenth century the Jesuit missionaries
and the French explorers, penetrating the wildernesses about Lake
Superior, found among the most treasured possessions of the Indians
pieces of copper weighing from 10 to 20 pounds. Often these frag-
ments of copper were regarded as household gods, and from an
indefinite past had been transmitted from generation to generation.
Tradition also told of larger masses of copper situated at several
points along the shores of the great lake, whose shifting sands often
covered up the bowlders for years at a time, thus causing the super-
stitious savages to declare that their offended deities had disappeared
for a season.!

In 1667 a piece of copper weighing a hundred pounds was brought
to Father Dablon. ‘The savages,” he reports,’ ‘do not all agree as to
the place whence this copper was derived. Some say it came from
where the [Ontonagon| River begins; others say close to the lake; and
others from the forks and gene the eastern bank.” Whether ue

1024 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Dablon fragment was a float piece of copper, or whether it was a por-
tion broken from the great rock, it is impossible to say. The reference
of the Jesuit father, however, makes it evident that at the time when
he wrote, the Indians were familiar with the copper region along the
Ontonagon, on the west bank of the west fork of which river the great
bowlder lay when discovered by white men.

In 1669 the French Government sent Louis Joliet to Lake Superior
to search for the deposits of copper so often referred to in the relations
of the missionaries, but he got no farther than Sault Ste. Marie, and
three years later he turned aside from such material pursuits to
‘accomplish, in company with Father Marquette, the discovery of the
Mississippi River. So far as authentic records go, the first white man
to visit the Ontonagon bowlder was Alexander Henry, an English
adventurer, and he saw it to his cost. Shortly after England acquired
Canada from France, Henry established himself as a trader at Macki-
nace, and his narrow escape from death at the hands of the savages in
the massacre at that post in 1763 forms one of the most thrilling chap-
ters of Parkman’s “Conspiracy of Pontiac,” and is also the basis of
Mrs. Catherwood’s more recent story, ‘‘ The White Islander.”

In 1771, lured doubtless by the mass of copper at the forks of the
. Ontonagon, Henry and his associates undertook to pierce the bluffs of
clay and red sandstone which bordered that stream,! in the hope of find-
ing the vein whence the bowlder came. Only complete ignorance of
the geology of the Lake Superior region can explain what Doctor
Houghton calls “these Quixotic trials ;’? and complete failure was the
natural result.

In 1819, General Lewis Cass made the first explorations of the Lake
Superior region that were undertaken by this Government. Turning
from their path, his party ascended the Ontonagon River for 30 miles
to visit the mass of copper whose existence, says Cass, had long been
known. ‘‘Common report,” he writes to John C. Calhoun, Secretary of
War, “has greatly magnified the quantity, though enough remains, even
aftera rigid examination, to render it a mineralogical curiosity. Instead
of being a mass of pure copper, it is rather copper embedded in a hard
rock, and the weight probably does not exceed 5 tons, of which the rock
is much the larger part. It was impossible to procure any specimens,
for such was its hardness that our chisels broke like glass. I intend to
send some Indians in the spring to procure the necessary specimens.
As l understand the nature of the substance, we can now furnish them
with such tools as will effect the object. I shall, on their return, send
you such specimens as you may wish to retain for the Government or
to distribute as cabinet specimens to the various literary institutions of
the country.”

THE ONTONAGON BOWLDER IN 1819.

THE ONTONAGON COPPER BOWLDER. 1025

Doctor Henry R. Schoolcraft, who was a member of the Cass expedi-
tion, says that the bowlder was found on the edge of the river, directly
opposite an island and at the foot of a lofty clay bluff, the face of which
appears at a former time to have slipped into the river, carrying with
it detached blocks and rounded masses of granite, hornblende, and
other rock, and with them the mass of copper in question. ‘The shape
of the rock,” he says, ‘“‘is very irregular. Its greatest length is 3 feet
8 inches; its greatest breadth, 3 feet 4 inches, and it may altogether
contain 11 cubic feet. In size it considerably exceeds the great mass
of native iron found some years ago upon the banks of the Red River,
in Louisiana, and now deposited among the collections of the New
York Historical Society, but, on account of the admixture of rocky
matter, is inferior in weight. Henry, who visited it in 1766, estimates
its weight at 5 tons; but, after examining it with scrupulous attention,
I do not think the weight of metallic copper in the rock exceeds 2,200
pounds. The quantity may, however, have been much diminished
since its first discovery, and the marks of chisels and axes upon it, with
the broken tools lying around, prove that portions have been cut off
and carried away.”!

Schoolcraft calls attention to the fact that the connection of the
bowlder with substances foreign to the immediate section of the
country where it lies, “indicates a removal from its original bed, while
the intimate connection of the metal and matrix, and the complete
envelopment of individual masses of copper by the rock, point to a
common and contemporaneous origin, whether that be referable to the
agency of caloric or water.”

Schoolcraft gives a view of the copper rock (see Plate 2) taken from
a point below the mass of copper, looking up the river; and from the
picture one readily understands with what difficulty the mass was
removed. The story of that removal is now to be told.

The party sent by Cass were not so fortunate as he anticipated they
would be. They cut about thirty cords of wood, which they placed
about the bowlder, and then set fire to the pile. When the copper was
well heated, they dashed water upon it, but the only result was to
detach pieces of quartz rock adhering to the native copper. The party,
having become disheartened, left the country, having moved therock 4
or 5 feet from the bank of the river; nor did the Barbeau party, who
went from Sault Ste. Marie two years later, have any better success.
It so happened, however, that Mr. Joseph Spencer, a member of the
Cass expedition, told the story of the copper rock to Mr. Julius Eldred,
a hardware merchant of Detroit; and for sixteen years this enter-
prising man schemed and planned how he might succeed where others
had failed.,?

1026 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

Until the report made by the State geologist of Michigan, Doctor
Douglass Houghton, in 1841, there had been no authentic or trustworthy
statements in regard to the copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior;!
but within four years from the date of that report the mineral lands
from the tip of Keweenaw Point to the Ontonagon River were overrun
with prospectors, the great majority of whom left dollars where they
found pennies. It isin Doctor Houghton’s report that the best scientific
account of the copper rock is to be found. ‘I have thus far,” he says,
‘“comitted to allude particularly to the large mass of native copper which
has been so long known to exist in the bed of the Ontonagon River,
lest, perhaps, this isolated mass might be confounded with the veins of
the mineral district. That this mass has once occupied a place in some _
one of these veins is quite certain, but it is now perfectly separated
from its original condition and appears simply as a loose transported
bowlder. * * * Thecopper bowlder is associated with rocky matter,
which in all respects resembles that associated with that metal in some
portions of the mines before described, the rocky matter being bound
together with innumerable strings of metal; but a very considerable
portion of the whole is copper in a state of purity. While this mass of
native copper can not fail to excite much interest, from its great size
and purity, it must be borne in mind that it is a perfectly isolated mass,
having no connection with any other; nor does the character of the
country lead to the inference that veins of the metal occur in the imme-
diate vicinity, though the mineral district crosses the country at a dis-
tance of but a few miles.”

Leaving for the moment the question as to the origin of the copper
rock, let us follow its history. Prior to 1843 not a pound of copper had
been shipped commercially from Lake Superior. The billion and a half
pounds which have been taken from that region have been mined since
that year, and more than half that product has been taken from a mine
discovered since the war of the rebellion ended. The Ontonagon bowl-
der was not regarded primarily in a commercial light; for its market
value as ingot copper could not have exceeded $600.2 Mr. Eldred’s
object in transporting it to the lower lakes was to exhibit it for money
in the various cities of the East. It was a curiosity. As Senator Wood-
bridge said, it was ‘(a splendid specimen of the mineral wealth of the
‘Far West.’”

In 1841 Mr. Eldred arranged with Samuel Ashman, of Sault Ste.
Marie, to act as his interpreter in the purchase of the copper rock from
the Chippewa Indians, on whose lands it was situated. Obtaining a
trading license from Mr. Ord, the Government agent, the two men set
out for the mouth of the Ontonagon, where they met the chiefs and con-
cluded the purchase for $150, of which sum $45 was paid in cash at the

time, and the remainder was paid in goods two years later. The party
then proceeded about 26 miles up the river, climbed the high hill
which intervened between the main stream and that point on the fork
where the rock was situated, and raised it on skids. More than this
they could not do; nor did they have greater success the following
summer.

In 1843 Mr. Eldred started from Detroit with wheels and castings
for a portable railway and car; and to protect his property rights, he
secured from General Walter Cunningham, the United States mineral
agent, a permit to occupy for mining purposes the section of land on
which the bowlder stood. Arriving at the rock, Mr. Eldred was sur-
prised and chagrined to find it in possession of a party of Wisconsin
miners under the direction of Colonel Hammond, who had located the
land under a permit made directly by the Secretary of War to Turner
and Snyder, and by their agent transferred to Hammond. The only
thing to do was to buy the rock again, and this Mr. Eldred did, paying
for it $1,365,

It took a week for the party of 21 persons to get the rock up the
50-foot hill near the river; then they cut timbers and made a stout
wooden railway track, placed the rock on the car, and moved it with
capstan and chains as houses are moved. [or four miles and a half,
over hills 600 feet high, through valleys and deep ravines; through
thick forests where the path had to be cut; through tangled under-
brush, the home of pestiferous mosquitoes, this railway was laid and
the copper bowlder was transported; and when at last the rock was
lowered to the main stream, nature smiled on the labors of the work-
men by sending a freshet to carry their heavily laden boat over the
lower rapids and down to the lake.!

While arranging transportation to Sault Ste. Marie, Mr. Eldred was
_confronted by an order from the Secretary of War to General Cun-
ningham directing him to seize the copper rock for transportation to
Washington. ‘The persons claiming the rock have no right to it,”
says Secretary Porter, ‘‘but justice and equity would require that they
be amply compensated for the trouble and expense of its removal from
its position on the Ontonagon to the lake; and for this purpose Gen-
eral C. will examine into their accounts and allow them the costs,
compensating them fully and fairly therefor, the sum, however, not to
exceed $700. * * * If they set up a claim for the ownership of the
article itself, that is not admitted or recognized, and their redress, if
they have any, will be by an application to Congress.”

1 Jones’s letter in New York Herald. I have carefully examined the statements
made by Mr. Alfred Meads in the Ontonagon Miner of June 22, 1895, assigning to
James Kirk Paul, the founder of the town of Ontonagon, the credit of bringing
down the rock. Undoubtedly Captain Paul was in the party, but the proof is con-
elusive that all work was done under the direction of Mr. Eldred.

The sum mentioned by the Secretary being manifestly too small to
compensate Mr. Eldred “fully and fairly,” General Cunningham allowed
the latter to transport the rock to Detroit, and promised that if the
curiosity was ordered to Washington, Mr. Eldred should be placed in
charge of it. On October 11, 1843, the bowlder was landed in Detroit!
and placed on exhibition for a fee of 25 cents; and among those who
embraced the opportunity to visit it was Henry R. Schoolcraft, who
renewed an acquaintance with the copper monarch, formed twenty-
three years before? After less than a month of uninterrupted posses-
sion, United States District Attorney George C. Bates informed Mr.
Eldred that the revenue cutter Hrie was waiting at Detroit to receive
the rock for transportation to the capital; and on November 9 the
bowlder started on its long journey,* by way of Buffalo, the Erie Canal,
and New York City, to Georgetown, District of Columbia, Mr. Eldred
accompanied it as far as New York, and met it at Georgetown with a
dray, by which it was hauled to the Quartermaster’s Bureau of the
War Department and deposited in the yard, where it remained until
sometime subsequent to 1855."

Mr. Eldred now appealed to Congress for redress; and it so happened
that in the Senate William Woodbridge, of Michigan, was chairman
of the Committee on Public Lands. An exhaustive report on the sub-
ject was made at the first session of the Twenty-eighth Congress, and
three years later, by an act approved January 26, 1847, the Secretary
of War was authorized “to allow and settle upon just and equitable

Doctor Thomas Wilson, of the National Museum, a second cousin of Cyrus Menden-
hall, who was one of the early proprietors and workers of copper mines in Lake
Superior (probably from 1840 to 1855 or 1856), contributes the following informa-
tion, which is of interest in this connection: ‘‘My uncle, Thomas Mercer, when a
young man, went from Columbiana County, Ohio, to Lake Superior as an assistant
to his cousin. In about 1848 he came down from Lake Superior, by way of the
canal, from Cleveland to Beaver with one of these immense masses of copper. He
dined en route at my father’s house at New Brighton, and in his company after
dinner I rode with him on the boat as far as Rochester. I remember the appear-
ance of the nugget of copper very well. It was as large or larger than the one in
the National Museum, and when I saw the latter, I thought it was the same which I
had seen on the boat. I learned from my father that the mags which we saw on
the boat was taken to Pittsburg, under the belief that it would prove of consider-
able profit "to its owners. It turned out to be a loss, however, owing to their
inability to melt it or to cut it, or in any way divide or separate it into small
enough pieces to handle. They built a fire over it as it stood in the yard. How
they then treated it I do not know; nor do I know that, with all this labor, it was
finally reduced. It brought no profit to the original owners.”’ Dr. Wilson thinks
that there must have been two or more of these large copper nuggets which were
brought down the lakes from Lake Superior,

terms the accounts of Julius Eldred and sons for their time! and
expenses in purchasing and removing the mass of native copper com-
monly called the copper rock.” The sum thus paid was $5,664.98,

From the yard of the old War Department to the National Museum
is not a long journey for so traveled a rock, and we need spend no time
on it. There is, however, another and a really important question as
to the origin of the bowlder. Accepting the statements of Schooleraft
and Doctor Houghton that the copper rock as found was an isolated
mass, but that it undoubtedly came from one of the veins in the narrow
copper belt, let us examine the results of explorations made since
their day.

During the winter of 1847-48 Mr. Samuel O. Knapp, the agent of the
Minnesota mine, observed on the present location of that mine a curi-
ous depression in the soil, caused, as he conjectured, by the disintegra-
tion of a vein. Following up these indications, he came upon a cavern,
the home of several porcupines. On clearing out the rubbish, he
found many stone hammers; and at a depth of 18 feet he came upon a
mass of native copper 10 feet long, 3 feet wide, and nearly 2 feet thick.’
Its weight was more than 6 tons. This mass was found resting upon
billets of oak supported by sleepers of the same wood. There were
three courses of billets and two courses of sleepers. The wood had
lost all its consistency, so that a knife blade penetrated it as easily as
if it had been peat; but the earth packed about the copper gave that a
firm support. By means of the cobwork the miners had raised the
mass about 5 feet, or something less than one-quarter of the way to the
mouth of the pit. The marks of fire used to detach the copper from
the rock showed that the early miners were acquainted with a process
used with effect by their successors. This fragment had been pounded
until every projection was broken off and then had been left, when and
for what reason is still unknown.’ From similar pits on the same loca-
tion came ten cart loads of ancient hammers, one of which weighed 394
pounds and was fitted with two grooves for a double handle. There
were also found a copper gad, a copper chisel with a socket in which
was the remains of a copper handle, and fragments of wooden bailing
bowls. At the Mesnard mine, in 1862, was found an 18-ton bowlder
that the ‘‘ancient miners” had moved 48 feet from its original bed.

'In Senate Report 260, Twenty-eighth Congress, first session, Mr. Eldred relates
his trials and final success. Several of the official communications quoted in this
article are printed in that report. The existence of the report, however, was devel-
oped from the communications which were kindly furnished me by Colonel F. C. Ains-
worth, chief of the Record and Pension Division of the War Department; Captain
C. T. Shoemaker, chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service, and Honorable T. Strobo
Farrow, Auditor of the Treasury for the War Department.

sion, p. 159.

5A cut and a full description of this find is given by Colonel Whittlesey in his
article on Ancient Copper Mining in the Lake Superior Region, Smithsonian Contri-
butions to Knowledge, XIII.
1030 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

The fact that growing in the débris of one of these ancient pits was
a hemlock having 395 annular rings places the date of the excava-
tions before the days of Columbus. That they were made by a race
distinct from the present Indians is inferred from the fact that the
Indians knew nothing of copper in place; and they had no traditions
of the ancient copper mines which cover the entire copper belt, and
which have been to modern miners the best indications of the presence
of that metal. Within 2 miles of one of these “ancient diggings,”
as they are called, the copper rock was found.

The question here arises, Was the Ontonagon bowlder detached by .
glacial action and carried southwesterly along the drift to the point
whence eventually it dropped into the bed of the river; or is it the
product of the mining operations of that busy people whose well-built
boats with each recurring summer in past ages dotted the clear waters
of Lake Superior, and whose keen search led them to the outcrops of
copper as well among the inhospitable thickets of the mainland as on
the wave-lashed islands of the greatest of lakes?

Such is the question propounded by Mr. Edwin J. Hulbert, who
spent the best years of his life in a study of the copper country ; and
whose recently published work on ‘*The Calumet Conglomerate”
marks him as the most scientific explorer who ever accomplished great
results in the Lake Superior copper country. Doubtless the question
is unanswerable ; but whether nature or man tore the copper rock from
its original home, it stands to-day as the first considerable shipment of
copper from the Lake Superior region and the largest mass ever taken
away from a mine. It is unique also in this: The mines of the Ontona-
gon region belong to the past. The great Minnesota mine from which
a 500-ton bowlder, valued at over $200,000, was taken, and whose
stockholders received $30 for every dollar they put in, has long ago
been surpassed by the Calumet & Hecla, whose ore contains but an
insignificant proportion of mass copper. There are no more masses of
virgin copper to be found ; and the Ontonagon bowlder is not only the
first, but it is also the last remaining representative of its kind.

TAXIDERMICAL METHODS IN THE LEYDEN MUSEUM,
HOLLAND.

By R. W. SHUFELDT,

Associate in Zodlogy, U. S. National Museum.

Since publishing my “Scientific Taxidermy for Museums,”! a num-
ber of well-known taxidermic artists in the museums of America and
Europe have written me concerning the various methods employed in
their art in the institutions they represent. There has also been pub-
lished a work by Mr. Montagu-Browne, entitled ‘‘ Artistic and Scien-
tific Taxidermy and Modeling.”? So far as the criticism of this last
volume has come to me, it would appear that it has by no means been
received with favor, either here or upon the Continent. Its main
defects, however, will be pointed out by me in another connection soon,
and will be only incidentally referred to in the present paper.

Of all th reports recently received, no one has excited my interest
more, or apparently contained suggestions of greater positive value,
than has a MS., illustrated by a large series of photographs, received
from Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., on the staff of and preparator to the
Museum of Natural History, of Leyden, Holland. This communication
is so full and the photographs so instructive that it commends itself to
taxidermists at large, and especially to those of this country, where
the methods in this art are now attracting so much attention.

For many years Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., and his father have been
engaged on the taxidermical work done in the Leyden Museum, where
Doctor J. Biittikofer is conservator, and where Doctor Fredericus A.
Jentick is in charge as director. Judging from the plates in my work
upon “Scientific Taxidermy for Museum,” these gentlemen all speak in
the highest possible terms of the artistic work in this line that has up
to the present time been accomplished in the U. 8S. National Museum. _
Especial delight is expressed upon examining the achievements in
modeling the marine invertebrates, and “the mounting of the fowls,
pigeons, and parrots,” and the wild turkey called forth expressions of
the most extravagant praise. Among the mammals, the bisons, the

1034 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

zebra, the tiger, and the rhinoceros, mounted by Jenness Richardson,
came in for the most favorable criticism, and this was given without
stint.

It is with no little envy, and with still more regret, that Mr. H. H. ter
Meer compares the advantageous circumstances under which the finished
pieces of work are placed upon exhibition at the National Museum, as
contrasted with what happens to them at Leyden, where the build-
ing is old, and where “the animals, instead of being placed in groups,
are packed away in a compact throng in dark cases, one animal admir-
ing the tail of the other.” !

Further discouragement is experienced from the fact that the Dutch
biologists filling the more influential positions do not exert themselves,
either by pen or word, to powerfully promote the art among them.
There are, further, no organized taxidermical societies in the country,
and little or no literature is produced to assist the taxidermice artist.
Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., is a firm believer in and advocate of the higher
education of taxidermists, as set forth in the aforesaid ‘“ Scientific
Taxidermy for Museums,” and he takes occasion to express himself
very forcibly to that effect. Pleasure is expressed at the fact that the
American taxidermists are thoroughly alive to the question that the
day is well past when the workman can hope to produce satisfactory
results by “stuffing skins of the forms they intend to preserve” instead
of by the use of the model and the manikin.

For some years past Mr. H. H. ter Meer has practiced what Kerr, his
able instructor, had taught him, and with ‘ extraordinary dexterity”
he sews strips of tow side by side upon the sculptured body of the
mammal, in such a manner as to exactly imitate the superficial muscles
and other parts in the way they occur in nature. Mammals’ heads are
“carved out of peat,” and it ‘‘does not matter out of what substance
a mammal is modeled, provided the form is reproduced exactly as it
would be were the animal alive, and that it is possible to drive pins
in it without bursting or breaking the artificially prepared body, in
order to press the skin into the hollows between the muscles.” It is
especially enjoined that the prepared model of the animal’s body be
the exact reproduction of the original, before the skin is drawn over
it, in order to obviate the necessity of subsequently introducing any
additional filling between it and the latter. Kerr’s methods of imitat-
ing the superficial anatomical parts require much patience and time
to learn and successfully practice, and this is apt to discourage many

"Since the present article was written the author has published three articles
entitled ‘Taxidermy at the Leyden Museum,” and these are illustrated by eleven
halftone figures, showing the most recent pieces mounted by Mr. ter Meer and his
father. One of these represent a fine group of jackals, so the charge that no group
of mounted mammals exists at the Leyden Museum must now be set aside. Various
other improvements have also been introduced in the taxidermical department of
the institution in question. (See Shooting and Fishing, XXII, Nos. 8, 9,and11. New
York, June 10, 17, July 1, 1897. Pp. 146, 147, 168, 169, 206, and 207.)

TAXIDERMICAL METHODS IN THE LEYDEN MUSEUM. 1035

young taxidermists at first, as it did Mr. H. H. ter Meer, but its advan-
tages are so great when once accomplished, that no abandoning there-
after is ever entertained by the expert.

My correspondent has succeeded in inventing a material, after years
of experiment and practice, that possesses the molding properties of
clay, and that dries with great rapidity and never cracks after onee
setting. I regret to say he has not given his formula for this material,
so much in demand the world over among taxidermie artists, and I
know of no better encouragement that Mr. H. H. ter Meer can extend
to his colleagues in the art than a full description of his materials and
methods, and thus break down the ancient barrier of secrecy, which in
times past has been one of the greatest drawbacks to the progress of
the art.

This new material was first employed by him in October, 1894, at
which time, or shortly after, he modeled the buffalo (Bubalus mindoren-
sis) Shown in Plate 4, figure 2. The material is worked in a thin layer
over the hollow wooden frame representing the animal’s form, even to
include the head, and the figure shows the result, at the point where
it is to receive the skin over it. No skull was used, and the entire
skeleton of this specimen could thus be saved for the Leyden Museum,
where it is now upon exhibition.

This being the first attempt with the new material, it naturally pre-
sents some faults, yet upon the whole the beauty of the model can be
easily appreciated from the figure, and it possesses the additional
advantage of being very light. Smaller mammals—the size of a
domestic cat, for example—are still mounted after the Kerr method, it
proving the most successful. This new material, and what can be accom-
plished by its use, has received the approval of Sir William Flower,
Doctor Bowdler Sharpe, and the distinguished artist, J. G. Keule-
mans, all of whom visited the museum at Leyden last year, to investi-
gate the process. Mr. H. H. ter Meer, sr., mounts many of the birds at
this institution, although the son also exerts his skill in this direction.
Some of these are beautiful examples of taxidermy, and from the series
sent me, I select a few, and these are given in my plates. Figure 2, of
Plate 2, is an excellent specimen of Buteo lagopus, and equally good
ones are seen in plate 6, figures 2 and 3 ( Botaurus stellaris and Pandion
haliaétus). It is said that Mr. H. H. ter Meer, sr., makes the artificial
bodies for his birds in so perfect a manner, that after the skin has been
placed over it, in any case whatever, he finds it quite unnecessary to
use ‘‘in strapping” either thread or pieces of cardboard to hold the
feathers in place. This is not even done in either the tail or the wings.
To show these results, photographs have been sent me of Cygnus olor,
Oedicnemus crepitans, Buteo vulgaris, Larus ridibundus, and the others
Shown in the plates. They are all fine pieces of work apparently, and
are especially to be admired for their peculiar lifelike fidelity to the
originals.
1036 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

By the aid of his special methods Mr. H. H. ter Meer, jr., has mounted
some fine mammal pieces, and a number of these are likewise shown in
the accompanying plates—as, for example, the female and young of
Simia satyrus (Plate 3, fig. 2, July, 1895), and a still better one, another
female of the same species (also preserved in July, 1895), and shown
with its model in Plate 1 and Plate 2, figures 1 and 3. This is one
of the most admirable and lifelike results that I have ever had the
pleasure of examining, and stands far ahead of the average mounted
Simian seen in the cases of the larger museums of the world. At the
time of its death it was nearly full-grown, and so is a most valuable
specimen. In April, 1896, the senior H. H. ter Meer mounted the fine
example of the Macaque (Macacus coninus) shown in Plate 3, figure 1,
while only a month before that the head of Felis leo, shown in Plate 4,
figure 1, was prepared. These talented taxidermists take especial
pride in their mounted specimen of Ovis tragelaphus (May, 1896), and
no less than three photographs of this piece have been submitted to
me, presenting it from different views. Two of these are shown in
Plate 5 and Plate 6, figure 1.

Mr. H. H. ter Meer fully agrees with the present writer in the use of
photographs and sketches as aids to the work of the taxidermie artist,
and by such means he has fully illustrated the topographical anatomy
of both the domestic cat and the horse, showing the muscles in various
positions of the body. In this connection he deplores the scarcity of
helpful manuals and text-books in such departments, and holds The Cat,
by Professor Mivart, and Specht’s designs of mammals, as among the
best that have thus far appeared, and he also speaks of the figures in
Brehm’s “‘ Thierleben” as also extremely useful.

When at Darmstadt some years ago, he “had an opportunity to
become acquainted with Mr. Kusthart’s method of mammal mounting.
After having glued large pieces of peat on a frame, he carves [out] like
a sculptor the whole animal from the peat, and thus obtains excellent
results, by adjusting the prepared skin over the sculptured body.”
“The gluing of the peat on the frame is, however, a very tedious piece
of work, but it admits of having the skin subsequently fixed ovex it
most accurately with pins.” My correspondent also comments upon
the taxidermical methods now coming into vogue in Paris, where they
cover the hollow wooden frame representing the body of the animal
with a layer of plaster-of-paris about one-half an inch thick. Some
tow is used in connection with the frame, and while the plaster isjn a
soft condition the taxidermist carves out rapidly the form of the ani-
mal. This method was published last year in Illustration, and the
article was illustrated by means of reproductions of photographs, giv-

among the muscles by means of pins, as the plaster would set too soon
for the purpose.

In terms most unqualified he condemns the methods of mammal
mounting practiced by Mr. Montagu-Browne at the Leicester Museum,
and described in his recent work. And heis quite correct when he points
out that it is simply impossible to get the correct form of a large mam-
mal for the purpose of a model by taking casts in plaster ‘of its lifeless,
flayed body.”

The method sees its most useful end in the reproduction of the forms
of dead animals—not living ones—and as the method is a time-wasting
and mechanical one, the hand of the skilled taxidermic artist must ever
be missed in its employment.

THE ANTIQUITY OF THE RED RACE IN AMERICA.

By THOMAS WILSON,

Curator, Department of Prehistoric Anthropology, U. S. National Museum.
» He} 4 pology

The only discussion in this paper is as to the antiquity of the Indian
or red race, and this applies only to the aborigines found here by
Columbus at the time of his discovery. No question is involved of
another or earlier race, by whatever name called, whether mound-
builder or paleolithic.

The ancestry of the American race has been variously attributed to
Semite, Pheenician, and Mongolian races, and, possibly, to a mixture of
some or all, with many additions. The best of these theories have been
based only on alleged similarities in characteristics of the Indians and
their alleged ancestors.

The argument can be placed on a broader basis; evidence can be
adduced bearing on more extended propositions and can be applied to
a larger group of these peoples.

The preliminary proposition is that the American race of Indians
is practically the same throughout the entire hemisphere. With all
their diversity of anatomy and physiology (which diversity, by the way,
is not greater among Indians than it is among various members of the
white or black races), they are of the same type, and form buf a single
race. Doctor Brinton gave this as his opinion in his address before the
Section of Anthropology of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science at its New York meeting. It is the basis of his book
on “The American Race.” Darwin remarks the close family resem-
blance between distant tribes in America. Doctor Coleman asserts the
essential physical identity of the American Indian. Starting, then,
with this assumption of the identity of race, it is to be argued that it
began in America in one of two ways—either by evolution from the
lower animals or by migration as man from other countries.

In whichever of these ways the red man appeared in America, we
are entitled to suppose, and may fairly argue, that in the beginning the
race was here represented by but few individuals. There may have
been but a single pair, or there may have been a hundred pairs, of
individuals. Either number will suit the argument. Accepting, then,
as a fact, the beginning of the red man in America with a small

1042 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1895.

number of individuals, it follows that they occupied a restricted
locality. This particular locality may have been on the east coast or
on the west coast, may have been north or south. The North Ameri-
can Indian has been on this hemisphere such a length of time that,
branching out from this little colony in a single locality by ordinary
procreation, he has so increased in numbers that at the time of the dis-
covery by Columbus, it is estimated that there were from five to eleven
millions.

From the single locality which the small colony originally inhabited,
it had also extended itself territorially, and had populated pretty equally
the hemisphere from the Arctic Circle on the north to Terra del Fuego
on the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific
Ocean on the west.

The first point is, that this increase in number, and this extension in
territory, required a long period of time, and are proofs of the antiquity
of the race.

The confusion of tongues and increase in the number of languages
among the Indians is another evidence of their antiquity. When the
first colony of Indians appeared, whether by evolution or migration, they
could have spoken practically but one language. Suppose, in case ot
migration, that they spoke many languages prior to their coming together
on these, to them, foreign shores, after their arrival they would inevitably
speak but one language. They would invent a common language if
none existed. This would not be difficult for a colony small in numbers.
With this for a starting point, we may see what they have done. They
spread themselves up and down the valleys, across the rivers, and over
the mountains. While at first they may have retained their communi-
cation with the parent colony and kept up their original language, it
continued only while those relations were maintained. When the off-
spring got so far distant that they did not visit the parent colony and
had no relation with its members, they invented their own languages,
different from those of their ancestors, and this continued until they
became a parent colony, sending forth younger colonies, which, in their
turn, cut off their relations and invented new languages. So they went
from east to west, north to south. This continued for such a great
length of time that, not only had they come at the time of the discov-
ery to occupy the entire hemisphere. but had also established (according
to the investigations of the Bureau of Ethnology) not less than two
hundred separate languages, fifty-two of which belonged to North
America alone, with dialects and variations innumerable. If we accept
these facts (and it appears as though we must), the corollary of the
immensity of the time is inevitable.

The different cultures among the aborigines or Indians of the West-
ern Hemisphere in different localities or portions of the country point
to the same general conclusion. Over all Canada and the United
States, except the extreme southwest, the culture, or rather the sav-

agery, of the nomadic Indians prevailed, which was indicated by their
principal occupations—war, hunting, and fishing.

Yet there are broad lines of demarcation in their culture, the princi.
pal and best defined of which was the building of mounds and earth-
works. These monuments, of such great magnitude and extent in
certain localities in the interior of the United States, did not extend
over half its territory. The mounds and earthworks were confined
between the twenty-fifth and the fifty-first northern parallels of lati-
tude, and between the sixty-ninth and one hundred and first meridi-
ans of longitude. The mound-building area had its greatest length
from Cape Sable, Florida, to Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, and its ereat-
est breadth from Point Pemaquid, Maine, to Bismarck, North Dakota.
No mounds or earthworks are found outside this area.

The cuiture of the aborigines occupying Mexico and Central America,
with the pueblo regions of Arizona and New Mexico, was of a totally
different character from that in the other regions of North America.
They were sedentary, agricultural, religious, and highly ceremonial;
they built immense monuments of the most enduring character, the
outside of the stone walls of some of which were decorated in a high
order of art, resembling more the great Certosa of Pavia than any
other monument in Europe. The Teoecalli, or mounds of ceremony or
sacrifice, were immense. The ‘manufacture and use of stone images
and idols were extensive and surprising to the last degree. Their
working of jade and the extensive use thereof surpasses that of any
other locality in prehistoric ‘times. Their pottery excites our wonder
and admiration; some specimens for their beauty, their elegance of
form, and their fineness of decoration; other specimens, of idols or
images, are astonishing on account of the precision of their manufac-
ture and of the difficulty of its accomplishment by hand.

The culture of Central America, Nicaragua, Yucatan, Costa Rica,
was as different from that of Mexico as the Mexican was from that of
the red Indian of the north. The gold ornaments of Chiriqui and
Quimbaya are evidence, not simply of a different material, but of a
different art in working that material. The pottery of Mexico, Nica-
ragua, and Costa Rica displays such marked differences of kind, form,
color, decoration, size, and mode of manufacture as to show as much
difference between the cultures of these countries with a separation
between them as clearly marked and isdlation each from the other as
between any three countries in modern times. The pottery milk pans
made in western Ohio and used there by our mothers were not more
different from the porcelain of Sevres or Meissen or the ware of Delft
than was the aboriginal pottery of America in different localities.

The culture of Colombia and Peru in South America tells the same
story of separation and long-continued isolation, and it finds its con-
tinuation among the aborigines of the Orinoco, Amazon, La Plata, and
so on south to Patagonia. The isolation of the Patagonians has been

continued for such a length of time as that, they have not only main-
tained a state of brutal savagery peculiar to themselves, but they have
made a distinct physical or somotological change, amounting not simply
to a different tribe, but almost to a different race, in that they are the
tallest people in the hemisphere, and, possibly, in the world.

Yet with all these differences, physical, technological, and sociological,
the aborigines of the hemisphere have retained their original character-
istics so as to stamp them all of one race—blood relations—all belonging
to the same stock and derived from the same ancestry. With all these
differences, the principal implements and objects employed by the
various tribes or peoples in all or any of the countries in the hemi-
sphere, whether in North or South America, were practically the same,
thus continuing the evidence of their relationship and early commu-
nication. The hammerstones, polished stone hatchets, the scrapers,
spindle whorls, and the great mass of aboriginal implements of stone
made by chipping or flaking, comprising arrow and spear heads, knives,
daggers, and poniards, are all so much alike as to show their rela-
tionship and, consequently, the relationship of the tribes or peoples
who made them. This being accepted, these immense differences are
accounted for only by the separation and isolation of certain of the
tribes of the red men, and this is evidence of their great antiquity and
long-continued occupation of the country.

Again, the fixedness of type and the persistence of animal character-
istics among the red Indians are further evidence. It is an accepted
anthropological and ethnological fact that the older a race is the more
deeply seated and permanently fixed become the traits of character in
its people. This carries with it the correlative proposition that the
more permanent the characteristics of a race, the better the evidence
of its antiquity. Applying this rule to the American Indians, we find
that, with all the diversity claimed, their characteristics are persistent,
even more than those of the white, the yellow, or the black races, and
that this includes the physical as well as the mental, moral, and socio-
logical traits. That the wild Indian is harder to tame than any other
human animal can only be accounted for on one of two theories—either
he has greater natural and original individuality, independence, and
self-reliance, a higher desire for liberty, and a determination to over-
come all obstacles in the way of maintaining that liberty, or else it is
the result of persistence through many generations in the condition of
savagery. Possibly it may be a combination of the two, and the latter
has produced the former. But in any event the fact remains that the
American Indian has greater fixity of type and of characteristics than
have other races, and this indicates, if it does not prove, the long-
continued and persistent exercise of the comlitions which produced
these characteristics and, consequently, his high antiquity.
THE ANTIQUITY OF THE RED RACE IN AMERICA. 1045

The discovery of America found the natives in that stage of culture
known in Europe as the neolithic period, or polished stone age. His
cutting implements were of stone and not of metal, and by whatever
method he shaped or made them, the finishing was by grinding or pol-
ishing. The similarities of the Indian’s culture with that of other
countries show that, if he migrated from any of these countries bring-
ing this culture with him, he did so at a period when they were in the
neolithic stage. This stage, and the one subsequent to it, was, in
the Eastern hemisphere, entirely in prehistoric times, and came to an
end at an early period. It belonged to the first and second, possibly
the third, cities of Troy, on the plain of Hissarlik, and came to an end
before the beginning of culture in Greece. When Homer wrote, it had
passed, not only behind the beginnings of Rome, but behind her prede-
cessors in Italy, the Etruscans. The introduction of bronze into France
and England, probably 2,000 years b. C., sounded the death knell of
the neolithic period and was the beginning of its end in those countries.
In Asia the historical evidence shows even an earlier cessation of the
neolithic period. The period of the Chinese civilization carries us back
much farther, and shows the people of that country to have passed
beyond the neolithic or polished stone age much earlier. Now the occu-
piers of American soil were emigrants from some, or, possibly, all of
the countries mentioned, but, whichever it may have been, the emigra-
tion must have taken place during the neolithic age, and not after its
close. Western Europe was the latest country in which the neolithic
period came to a close and was succeeded by the age of bronze. So
the commencement of the age of bronze in Europe affords a supposi-
titious mark in the history of our country as the latest date at which
the neolithic migration to America could have taken place. How much
earlier it might have been, is a matter of speculation.

These arguments, based upon facts which appear indisputable, go to
show that the migration by which the American race came to occupy
the Western Hemisphere could not have been less than two thousand
years prior to the Christian era, but that, if they came from other
countries, they might have come a long time before.
