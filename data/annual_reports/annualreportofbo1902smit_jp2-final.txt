PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS AT THE ANNUAL
MEETING HELD JANUARY 22, 1902.

Wednesday of each year, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: Chief Justice Fuller, (Chancellor), in the chair; the Hon.
William P. Frye; the Hon. 8S. M. Cullom; the Hon. O. H. Platt; the

EXCUSES FOR NONATTENDANCKE.

The Secretary explained that Mr. Hitt was unable to be present
owing to temporary indisposition, and that Dr. Andrew D. White was

At the suggestion of the Chancellor, the Secretary read the minutes
of the last meeting in abstract, and there being no objection, they
were declared approved.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS.

The Secretary stated that Vice-President Roosevelt had been
ex-oflicio a member of the Board, but that by reason of his succession
on September 14, 1901, to the Presidency through the death of Presi-
dent McKinley, his membership upon the Board had ceased, and he
had become the presiding ofticer of the Institution. In accordance
with precedent, an invitation had been extended to the President pro
tempore of the Senate, the Hon. William P. Frye, to attend the meet-
ing in place of the Vice-President. The Secretary announced the
appointment of Senator Francis M. Cockrell, of Missouri, to succeed
Senator Lindsay, and the reappointment of Senator S. M. Cullom and
of Representatives R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, jr., and Hugh A. Dins-

XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

‘The Secretary presented his report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, which was accepted, and
in which he invited the Board’s attention to the statements concerning
the National Zoological Park, the International Exchange Bureau, and
the other interests under their charge. He spoke particularly with
regard to the crowded condition of the National Museum, the need for
additional space for the exhibition and care of the increasing collee-
tions, and the need of special action to secure it.

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That a committee consisting of six members of this Board be appointed
by the Chancellor, whose duty it shall be to represent to Congress the pressing
necessity of additional room for the proper exhibition of specimens belonging to the
National Museum, and of additional appropriations to carry on the work of the
Museum.

The Chancellor appointed as members of this committee, Senators
Platt, Cullom, and Cockrell, and Representatives Hitt, Adams, and
Dinsmore.

Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, pre-
sented the annual report of that committee for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1901.

On motion, the report was adopted.

REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE.

Senator Henderson, chairman of the permanent committee, made
the following statement:

THE HODGKINS FUND.

The Regents will remember that in addition to the sum of approximately $208,000
already deposited in the general fund constituted by the Hodgkins bequest, and
first-class bonds of a present market value of perhaps $42,000, already in the custody
of the Institution, a residual sum of about $9,000 is still in the hands of the executor
of the estate, and is deposited with the New York Insurance and Trust Company of
New York City, by order of court, awaiting the decision of certain suits in which the
liability of the estate of Mr. Hodgkins, on account of a warranty of title by him in
the transfer of certain property in New York City, is in question.

One of the two small properties in Ilizabeth, N. J., derived by the Institution
through the Hodgkins bequest, was sold during the year, with the approval of the
permanent committee, for $600. The remaining property, consisting of a single
house and lot, the value of which is estimated at $1,000, has been continued in the
care of the real estate agents in Elizabeth, who have been charged with its manage-
ment for several years. It is, in the opinion of the permanent committee, -desirable
that this small holding be likewise disposed of whenever an opportunity for its sale
at a fair price is presented.

THE AVERY FUND.

The properties received by the Institution from the Avery bequest have been esti-
mated to be worth $26,000. They are mostly unimproved, and yield a revenue of
only about $500 a year. Mrs. Julia N Chase (formerly Miss Julia N. Avery) pre-
sented a claim for $636 against the Institution on account of a slight encroachment

by one of the properties on the adjoining premises owned by her. After some. nego-
tiation the matter was adjusted by the payment to Mrs. Chase of the sum of $220
and the conveyance of the narrow strip of land in question to the Institution. The
committee recommends that in case a fair price be offered for any of these properties
the Institution dispose of its holdings.

THE ANDREWS BEQUEST.

At the last annual meeting of the Regents the specification in the will of Wallace C.
Andrews, deceased, naming the Institution as the residuary legatee of his estate,
contingent on the failure of a bequest for founding at Willoughby, Ohio, an institu-
tion for the free education of girls, was set forth at some length. It appears that
after specific bequests amounting to $500,000 have been executed a residuum of at
least $1,000,000 will remain. Mr. Hackett, counsel for the Institution, is in commu-
nication with the counsel for the executor, and Edmund Wetmore, Esq., a member
of the bar of the State of New York, has also been retained to look after the interests
of the Institution in the matter. The following extract is quoted from Mr. Hackett’s
report on the present status of the bequest, so far as it concerns the Institution:

“‘As already stated, the scheme of founding a young ladies’ school in Ohio is likely
to prove impracticable. It is significant that, as yet, no one in Ohio has taken any
steps to secure the payment of the legacy. Under the terms of the will certain offi-
cials, including the governor of the State, are made trustees to administer this fund.
The mayor of the little town (Willoughby ) is of the board. This officer has inquired
of. Mr. Hawes as to what has been done in the premises, but no active interest is
exhibited in Ohio for the reason that there is no one who may be said to have an
interest in the success of the scheme.”’

It is hoped that before long an amicable understanding may be had for obtaining
a ruling of the court as a guide to the executor in carrying out the provisions of the
will.

THE SPRAGUE BEQUEST.

The attention of the Regents was called at their last meeting to the provisions of
the will of Mr. Joseph White Sprague, who, after bequeathing certain personal
effects to relatives, directs the executor, in trust, to convert the personalty into money
and to distribute 85 per cent of the income of the entire estate among certain devisees
until twenty years after the death of the last of said devisees, when the trust will
expire by limitation and all assets in the hands of the trustee will be conveyed to the
United States of America in accordance with the following paragraph in the will:

‘‘When the trust herein created expires by limitation, as aforesaid, then all dis-
tribution of the income of the trust property is to cease, and said trustee is instructed
and directed to assign and make over by proper conveyance all trust property in his
possession, whether real or personal, invested or uninyested, to the United States of
America, to be held by said United States as a portion of the funds of the Smithson-
ian Institute, to be known as the ‘Sprague fund,’ the income of this fund to be used
as follows: One-half of said income in each year to be added to the principal. The
other half of said income is to be expended, under the direction of the officers of the
said Institute, in such manner as will in their judgment best promote the advance-
ment of the physical sciences, either by arranging for the giving of free lectures, on
scientific subjects, in different cities and towns of the said United States, or by pro-
viding for original scientific research in the laboratory and otherwise, or by the pub-
lication of the results of original scientific researches, or by offering, from time to
time, rewards or medals, for meritorious discoveries, or by any or all of these
methods, as in their judgment may seem best. The half of the gross income thus
authorized to be expended annually is to be cumulative, so that the portion of it
unexpended during any one year may be expended during any subsequent year or
years.”’ :
XIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Although the time at which the Institution will derive any profit from the above
legacy may reasonably be assumed to be somewhat remote, it is believed, if the news-
paper estimate of $200,000 be even approximately accurate, that the amount of the
fund which will accrue to the Institution will not be inconsiderable. At present
there would seem to be no further duty imposed upon the Institution than to see
that the property is accounted for and is held in safe hands.

On motion, the report was accepted.
Senator Henderson, as chairman of the executive committee, pre-
sented the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1903, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Sec-
retary, with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

REMOVAL OF SMITHSON’S REMAINS.

The Secretary recalled to the Board the resolution adopted by it
at the last meeting with regard to the removal of the remains of
James Smithson. The wishes of the Board were communicated to
one of the officers of- the English church at Genoa, Mr. E. A. Le
Mesurier, who, under date of December 23, 1901, replied in part as

follows:

You are aware that our hope is eventually to obtain for our countrymen a separate
burying place which by an easy, and I may say obvious, arrangement might be
made to give shelter not merely to British subjects, but to American also. I regret
to say, however, that I see no chance for the present of this most desirable consum-
mation, as the authorities (apparently in consequence of the difficulty of finding an
alternative site) have withdrawn their offer of providing us with a fresh cemetery if
we allowed them to transfer at once all remains from San Benigno, where your founder
rests. The present policy of the authorities is presumably to let things remain as they
are until the time comes (three years or so hence) when the law of public utility
will strengthen their hands as to taking possession of the San Benigno ground, of
course under the obligation of transporting the remains elsewhere, which would in
all probability mean a portion of the general Protestant Cemetery and not a separate
place of interment. When the time for the transfer approaches it will be obviously
expedient to apply to the British ambassador at Rome (backed up as we are con-
fident will be the case by the friendly offices of the representative of the United
States) to put the case before the Italian Government, so that the local authorities
may be enjoined to carry out the process with all due reverence and if possible (as
it ought to be possible) to a specially reserved new cemetery, Our consul is most
fully alive to the importance of diplomatic support and will take the initiative in
due course.

Mr. Bell here said that he would like very much to have in the
record that he had presented to the Board at the last meeting his
strong feeling that the remains of Smithson should be brought to this
country.

The Secretary informed Mr. Bell that his remarks were now on the
written record,
-

SANTA FE PALACE.

The Secretary said that the governor of New Mexico had offered to
transfer to the Institution an ancient Spanish palace in Santa Fe, on
condition that it be maintained, without cost to the State, as a museum
of the archeology of the Southwest. After discussion the Board
decided that it was inadvisable to accept the proposition.

THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTION.

The Secretary said that since the foundation of the Smithsonian
Institution there had perhaps occurred no event of more importance
to it than the foundation of a new institution—the Carnegie Institu-
tion—whose declared aims and general purposes were nearly those
which the Institution has hitherto considered its own. Mr. Carnegie
invited the Secretary of the Smithsonian to become a member of the
board of trustees for the management of this fund, in the following
letter:

DrckMBER 27, 1901.
Dear Sir: I am about to transfer ten millions of 5 per cent bonds to a body of
trustees for the purposes described in the inclosed paper. A list of the trustees
selected is also inclosed. e
It will be a source of much pleasure to me if you will kindly consent to serve.
Truly yours,
ANDREW CARNEGIE,
The SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The letter was accompanied by a list of the trustees and by a state-
ment of the considerations which led to the establishment of the foun-
dation. The Secretary read the articles of incorporation of the new
institution, and stated that after conference with the Chancellor and
the chairman of the executive committee, he had accepted the trustee-
ship in the following terms, conditionally on the approval of the board:

DECEMBER 351, 1901.

Dear Str: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th
instant, with the accompanying papers outlining the general purpose of an institution
or establishment which you propose to found in the city of Washington for the
encouragement of research and kindred purposes, and also inclosing a list of proposed
trustees, in which you are good enough to name the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution as an ex officio member.

It will give me, personally, great pleasure, with the consent of the Regents, to
accept membership upon this board, and I desire to express my sense of warm recog-
nition of the large purposes which have inspired you to make this noble benefaction.
IT accept such membership in the absence of knowledge as to details, but in the full
confidence of a sympathy with your general purpose.

Very respectiully, yours, 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
ANDREW CARNEGIE, Esq.,
No. & West Fifty-fifth Street, New York City.
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

He then stated certain considerations with regard to the relationship
of the Smithsonian Institution to the Carnegie Institution, and asked
for an expression of the opinions of the Regents for his instruction.
After discussion it was announced as the sense of the Board that the
Secretary should accept the trusteeship unfettered by instructions.

PUBLICATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION.

The Secretary called the attention of the Board to the exhibition of
Reports and other publications which had been issued by the Institu-
tion during the year.

The Secretary then spoke of the affairs of the Bureau of Ethnology,
and of the Astrophysical Observatory, whose first volume of the
Annals he exhibited. With regard to the Observatory, the Secretary
said further that Congress had asked for a report of the appropria-
tions granted it and of the results obtained. Such a report had been
submitted at the beginning of the session, and had been ordered
printed. It included the Annals above referred to, and he had been
enabled to add a number of commendatory letters from eminent men
of science, such as Sir George Stokes, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Kelvin,
Sir William Huggins, Sir Robert Ball, Prof. Simon Newcomb, Prof.
EK. C. Pickering, Prof. G. E. Hale, and others.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on
motion the meeting adjourned.

by Congress, and the receipts and expenditures for the Smithsonian
Institution, the U. S. National Museum, the International Exchanges,

balances of former years:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
Condition of the Fund July 1, 1902.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of
August 10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of
Congress, February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson, savings
from income, and other sources, to the amount of $134,83

To this also have been added a bequest from James Hamilton, ot
Pennsylvania, of 31,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New
York, of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500;
a gift from Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000 and
$8,000, being a portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodg-
kins, and $1,000, the accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest,
making in all, as the permanent fund, $912,000,

The Institution also holds the additional sum of $42,000, received
upon the death of Thomas G, Hodgkins, in registered West Shore
Railroad 4 per cent bonds, which were, by order of this committee,
under date of May 18, 1894, placed in the hands of the Secretary of
the Institution, to be held by him subject to the conditions of said
order.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 380, 1902, each of
which bears the approval of the secretary or, in his absence, of the
acting secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the
disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment
as such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have
been examined and found correct.

SCRE TMA-ReY OF DHE SMITASONTAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1902.

To the Board of Regents of the Sinithsonian Lnstitution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my report show-

ing the operations of the Institution during the year ending June 30,
1902, including the work placed under its direction by Congress in the
United States National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology,
the International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the
Astrophysical Observatory.
_ Following the precedent of several years, there is given, in the body
of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution and
its bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by
the persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work.
Independently of .this, the operations of the National Museum are
fully treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report, and the
Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes «a volume
prepared under the supervision of the Director of that Bureau.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Institution was created an Establishment. Its statutory members sre
the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice of the United
States, and the heads of the Executive Departments. The preroga-
tive of the Establishment is ‘tthe supervision of the affairs of the
Institution and the advice and instruction of the Board of Regents.”

On the death of President McKinley on September 14, 1901, Vice-
President Roosevelt succeeded to the Presidency and a vacancy
occurred in the vice-presidency. Other changes were caused by the
resignation of the Hon. Lyman J. Gage, Secretary of the Treasury;

sm 1902———1

? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy, and the Hon. Charles
Emory Smith, Postmaster-General.
As organized on June 30, 1902, the Establishment consisted of the
following ex officio members:
THEODORE RoosEvE.tT, President of the United States.
(Vacancy), Vice-President of the United States.
Mevitte W. Furr, Chief Justice of the United States.
Joun Hay, Secretary of State.
Leste M. Suaw, Secretary of the Treasury.
Eninu Root, Secretary of War.
PHILANDER C. Knox, Attorney-General.
Henry C. Payne, Postmaster- General.
Wiiuiam H. Moony, Secretary of the Navy.
ErHan ALLEN Hircncock, Secretary of the Interior.
James Wiison, Secretary of Agriculture.

BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Board of Regents consists of the Vice-President and the Chief
Justice of the United States as ex officio members, three members of
the Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, and six
citizens, “‘two of whom shall be residents of the city of Washington
and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State, but no two of
them of the same State.”

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 22, 1902, at 10
o'clock a. m.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which will be found
in detail in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

The Secretary stated that Vice-President Roosevelt had been ex officio
a member of the Board, but that by reason of his succession to the
Presidency through the death of President McKinley his membership
upon the Board had ceased, and he had become the presiding officer
of the Institution. In accordance with precedent, an invitation had
been extended to the President pro tempore of the Senate, the Hon.
William P. Frye, to attend the meeting in place of the Vice-President.

He announced the reappointment, as Regents, of Representatives
R. R. Hitt, Robert Adams, jr., and Hugh A. Dinsmore, whose terms
had expired.

The Secretary presented bis report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, inviting the Board’s
attention to the statements concerning the National Zoological Park,
the International Exchange Bureau, and the other interests under
their charge. He spoke particularly with regard to the crowded con-
dition of the National Museum, the need for additional space for the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3)

exhibition and care of the increasing collections, and the need of
special action to secure it.

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

Pesolved, That a committee consisting of six members of this Board
be appointed by the Chancellor, whose duty it shall be to represent to
Congress the pressing necessity of additional room for the proper
exhibition of specimens belonging to the National Museum, and of
additional appropriations to carry on the work of the Museum.

The Chancellor appointed as members of this committee Senators
Platt, Cullom, and Cockrell, and Representatives Hitt, Adams, and
Dinsmore.

The Board adopted the annual reports of the executive and perma-
nent committees, which had been presented by their chairman, Senator
Henderson, The usual resolution relative to income and expenditure
was adopted.

The Secretary read a letter from the authorities of the British
burial ground at Genoa, stating that when the time arrived for the
abolition of the cemetery by the Italian Government and the transfer
of the bodies there to a new site, the remains of Smithson would be
reinterred with due reverence and care.

Mr. Bell said that he would like very much to have the records show
that he had presented to the Board at the last meeting an expression of
his strong feeling that the remains of Smithson should be brought to
this country.

The Secretary said that the governor of New Mexico had offered to
transfer to the Institution an ancient Spanish palace in Santa Fe, on
condition that it be maintained, without cost to the State, as a museum
of the archeology of the Southwest. After discussion the Board
decided that it was inadvisable to accept the proposition.

The Secretary said that since the foundation of the Smithsonian
Institution there had perhaps occurred no event of more importance
to it than the foundation of a new institution—the Carnegie Institu-
tion—whose declared aims and general purposes were nearly those
which the Institution has hitherto considered its own. Mr. Carnegie
invited the Secretary of the Smithsonian to become a member of the
board of trustees for the management of this fund, in the following
letter:

DECEMBER 27, 1901.
Dear Str: I am about to transfer ten millions of 5 per cent bonds to a body of
trustees for the purposes described in the inclosed paper. A list of the trustees
selected is also inclosed
It will be a source of much pleasure to me if you will kindly consent to serve.
Truly yours, ANDREW CARNEGIE.
2 2
The SecRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
The letter was accompanied by a list of the trustees and by a state-
ment of the considerations which led to the establishment of the foun
dation. The Secretary read the articles of incorporation of the new
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

institution, and stated that after conference with the Chancellor and
the chairman of the executive committee, he had accepted the trustee-
ship in the following terms, conditionally on the approval of the
board:

DECEMBER 31, 1901.

Dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th
instant, with the accompanying papers outlining the general purpose of an institution
or establishment which you propose to found in the city of Washington for the
encouragement of research and kindred purposes, and also inclosing a list of proposed
trustees, in which you are good enough to name the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution as an ex officio member.

It will give me, personally, great pleasure, with the consent of the Regents, to
accept membership upon this board, and I desire to express my sense of warm recog-
nition of the large purposes which have inspired you to make this noble benefaction.
I accept such membership in the absence of knowledge as to details, but in the full
contidence of a sympathy with your general purpose.

Very respectfully, yours, S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
ANDREW CARNEGIE, Esq.,
No. 5 West Fifty-fifth Street, New York City.

He then stated certain considerations with regard to the relationship
of the Smithsonian Institution to the Carnegie Institution, and asked
for an expression of the opinions of the Regents for his instruction.
After discussion, it was announced as the sense of the Board that the
Secretary should accept the trusteeship unfettered by instructions.

The Secretary then spoke of the affairs of the Bureau of Ethnology,
and of the Astrophysical Observatory, whose first volume of the
Annals he exhibited. With regard to the Observatory, the Secretary
said further that Congress had asked fora report of the appropriations
granted it and of the results obtained. Such a report had been sub-
mitted at the beginning of the session, and had been ordered printed.
It included the Annals above referred to, and he had been enabled to
add a number of commendatory letters from eminent men of science,
such as Sir George Stokes, Lord Rayleigh, Lord Kelvin, Sir William
Huggins, Sir Robert Ball, Prof. Simon Newcomb, Prof. E. C. Picker
ing, Prof. G. E. Hale, and others.

ORGANIZATION OF BOARD OF REGENTS.

As organized at the end of the fiscal year, the Board of Regents
consisted of the following members:

The Hon. M. W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States, Chan-
cellor; the Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the United
States Senate; Senator S$. M. Cullom; Senator O. H. Platt; Senator
Francis M. Cockrell; Representative R. R. Hitt; Representative Rob-
ert Adams, jr.; Representative Hugh A. Dinsmore; Dr. James B.
Angell; Dr. Andrew D. White; the Hon. J.B. Henderson; Prof. A.
Graham Bell; the Hon. Richard Olney, and the Hon. George Gray.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. D
ADMINISTRATION.

The general supervision of the business of the several dependencies
placed by Congress under the direction of the Institution has year by
year required the increased personal attention of the Secretary,
although as far as seems practicable the carrying out of details has
been left to those in immediate charge of the work of the bureaus.
The cost of the clerical Jabor involved in this general supervision by
the Secretary's office is in part met by allotments from the various
Government appropriations, although the limited income of the Insti-
tution is still drawn upon for many matters which should properly be
provided for by Congress.

The Board has authorized the Secretary to lay these matters before
Congress, but the needs of other parts of the Institution’s service
have seemed so pressing that he has as yet deferred doing so in favor
of such other demands.

BUILDINGS.

Some much-needed repairs to the main roof of the Smithsonian
building were in progress at the close of the fiseal year. In this
connection it seems important to call attention to the necessity of
a reconstruction of the ceiling and other renovations of the large
Anthropological Hall, whose noble dimensions deserve a worthier
treatment, and of improving the access to it.

Improvements were made in the Smithsonian basement in the
quarters occupied by the Exchange Office and a hydraulic elevator
was constructed for the handling of heavy packages.

In the paragraphs devoted to the Museum and to the Zoological
Park mention is made of building improvements during the year.

FINANCES.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1901, the unexpended
balance, as stated in my last report, was $83,963.26.  Durine the
year the total receipts by the Institution were 866,811.09. Of this
sum $56,400 was derived from interest, while the remaining $10,411.09
was received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements during the year amounted to $69,653.44, the
details of which are given in the report of the executive comiittee.
The balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1902,
for the expenses of the Institution Was 881,120.91. A considerable
part of this balance is held against the accumulated interest on the
Hodgkins and other funds and against certain contingent obligations
which may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific inves-
tigations and publications in progress.

The above fund is deposited in the Treasury of the United States,
under the provisions of the act organizing the Institution and the
act of Congress approved March 12, 1894, and bears interest at 6 per
cent per annum. The interest alone is employed in carrying out the
aims of the Institution. The Regents hold certain approved railroad
bonds, in addition to the permanent fund, which form part of the fund
established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations into the properties of
atmospheric air.

The Institution was charged by Congress, during the fiscal year of
1902, with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

RESEARCH.

It was a part of the original plan of the Institution that its Secretary
should not give his time wholly to administrative duties. but should,
as a student of nature. directly aid in its scientific investigations.’

Research work in various fields of science has been continued by
the Institution and its dependencies. The Secretary has made some
progress toward the solution of the problem of mechanical flight. and
has been carrying on, with the consent of the Regents. some experi-
ments for the War Department. at its expense, and is adding other
experiments, partly at the expense of the Institution. In the Astro-
physical Observatory he has continued work believed to be important,
and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest. which are referred
to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the
Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological and ethno-
logical researches, which will be found fully described elsewhere in
this report and need not be repeated here.

HODGKINS FUND.

In connection with the administration of the Hodgkins fund, papers
recording the advance of specialists along various interesting lines of
investigation have been submitted, some of which are now in course
of publication.

> Resolved, That the Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre-
sent such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian
{Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847.)

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The report of the research on the spectrum conducted by Dr. Victor
Schumann, of Leipzig, has received extensive additions during the year,
notably through a detailed description of the ingenious apparatus used
in his work. This supplement is accompanied by illustrations which
appear now for the first time, although Dr. Schumann has been author-
ized to announce in the scientific journals of his own country the dis-
coveries made in the course of his experiments, at the same time
notifying the Institution of his progress.

A second grant on behalf of Dr. Schumann has been approved dur.
ing the year, and it is interesting to know that Harvard University,
recognizing the value of his work, has also awarded hima grant. The
new Physical Institute of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Leipzig
has likewise aided this research by placing laboratory room at the dis-
posal of Dr. Schumann, who, it is hoped, will be able in the near
future to secure still more complete results from his painstaking
experiments in vacuum spectroscopy.

The memoir by Dr. Carl Barus, mentioned in my last report as in
course of publication, has been issued during the year as part of Vol-
ume XXITX, Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. It describes
experiments with ionized air begun by Dr. Barus some years since
and recently prosecuted under a Hodgkins grant from the Institution.
The research was tributary to an investigation of the colors of cloudy
concensation. Lord Rayleigh’s famous theory, if applied, would stop
at the deep reds of the first order, terminating in opaque, whereas in
the Jaboratory experiments exceptionally brilliant colors, extending
almost into the third order of Newton’s.series, may be produced. It
was thus essential as a preliminary step to investigate appropriate
means for the production of nuclei, to determine their number per
cubic centimeter, their velocity, their association with ionization, the
effect of the pressure of an electric field, ete. This was the general
trend of the experiments by Dr. Barus. The endeavor was made with
the aid of the condensation tube to show that the nucleus has a specific
velocity of its own, and that this is retained even in the absence of an
electric field. The application of this principle to plate, to tubular,
and to spherical condensers leads, in every case and in spite of the
variation of method, to an order of values as to the number of parti-
cles in action, agreeing with the data obtained by other investigators
from different experiments and theoretically different points of view.

A second grant has been approved on behalf of Dr. Barus, and a
new memoir on the structure of the nucleus, detailing experiments
subsequent to those described in the yolume just published is soon to
be submitted by him.

The experiments in air resistance by Mr. C. Canovetti, referred to
in the Secretary’s last report, which were begun at Brescia, Italy, of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Ss)

which city he was at that time engineer in chief, have been continued
in Italy, where by means of an ingenious apparatus he has prosecuted
a research which has been reported upon in detail, with illustrations
accompanied by tables giving the numerical results attained. After
compliance with the request of the Institution in regard to submitting
his report, a second moderate grant was approved on behalf of Mr.
Canovetti in March of this year. A report of the results of the
experiments under this second grant is now awaited.

Dr. von Lendenfeld, of the University of Prague, who has been
aided by a grant from the Hodgkins fund, reports that his studies are
now sufliciently advanced to enable him to begin the preparation of
his manuscript for publication. Telephotography has been extensively
and successfully used in this research, and the summary of work
already submitted is accompanied by interesting illustrations.

A monograph embodying the results of the completed research,
which will be published later, will present an anatomical and physio-
logical study of insects, the lower vertebrates (Exoccetus, Draco,
ete.), birds, mammals (Petaurus, Geleopithecus, etc.), and will treat
of the polygenetic development of the organs of flight in animals.
The physical properties of the air, wind velocities, resistance, ete.,
will be considered, and it is hoped that the publication will not only
prove of general interest but will become a valuable work of reference
for students.

Dr. Marey, of the French Institute, mentioned in my last report as
having been awarded a grant from the Hodgkins fund, is still contin-
uing his most interesting experiments. The application of metro-
photography and chronophotography to this investigation has been
described by Dr. Marey ina paper of such general value that it was
published in the appendix to the report of the Secretary for 1901.) In
this edition of the paper are included copies of special and interesting
photographs which have been forwarded to the Institution by Dr.
Marey.

The research into the nature of vowels by Prof. Louis Bevier, of
Rutgers College, has been reported on through a series of published
articles, transmitted by the author to the Institution, which record
in detail the results thus far obtained. The investigation is still in
progress, the vowel series from a to u being now under analysis and
discussion,

During this year a grant has been approved on behalf of Mr. E. C.
Huffaker for the construction and practical application of a device
intended to produce x uniform and measured flow of air through a
tube of any desired diameter,

This apparatus is primarily designed for use in connection with
investigations in the line of biology, and it has already been applied
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to exact experiments in the development of the embryo in the ege.
It is hoped that by means of this invention facts may be established
which will prove of practical value.

The meteorological investigation in connection with air currents at
varying altitudes, heretofore reported on as conducted by Mr. A. L.
Rotch at Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory, have been supple-
mented this year by a series of experiments on the lift and drift of
the wind on plane and curved surfaces. Mr. A. A. Merrill, who was
recommended by Mr. Rotch for this work, received a grant from the
Hodgkins fund and has from time to time reported the result of his
experiments.

The grant to the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric
Electricity has been continued during the past year, a specified
number of copies of the Journal being sent out, as directed by the
Institution, to specialists and to educational establishments.

In May, 1902, an application for a grant from the Hodgkins fund
was made by Prof. Morris W. Travers, of University College, London,
which, after the customary reference, examination, and discussion,
was approved in June of this year. Professor Travers has been the
colleague of Prof. William Ramsey in his later researches upon the
rare gases of the atmosphere, and is now engaged in an investigation
which will deal largely with the liquid properties of hydrogen.

A summary of the progress of this investigation, on behalf of which
the final grant of this year is approved, will find place in the next
report.

The difficulties in the way of submitting, during the progress of a
research, a report which is even measurably satisfactory to an inves-
tigator, are appreciated by the Secretary, whose duty it becomes, year
by year, to record so far as possible the advance of the investigations
which the terms of the bequest allow him to aid by grants from the
Hodgkins fund.

In November, 1901, a special committee, the members of which
represented the departments of biology, physics, chemistry, geology,
meteorology, astronomy, electricity, and anthropology, was appointed
to consider the award of the Hodgkins special medal, which, as stated
in the report for 1899, is bestowed only for important contributions
to the knowledge of the nature and properties of atmospheric air, or
for original and practical applications of present knowledge to the
welfare of mankind, thus complying not only with the terms of the
Hodgkins Fund, but also furthering the expressed aim of the founder
of the Institution.

As will be remembered, the first special Hodgkins medal was awarded
in 1899 to Prof. James Dewar, of the Royal Institution of Great Britain.

In accordance with the recommendation of the committee, the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oh

present award is made to Prof. J. J. Thomson, of Trinity College,
Cambridge, England, and» is, broadly stated, for his investigations
on the conductivity of gases, especially on the gases that compose
atmospheric air.

NAPLES TABLE.

The lease by the Institution, for a third term of three years, of a
table in the Naples Zoological Station, which expired on the 30th of
June, 1902, has been extended until the 31st of December of the same
year. Following this action, numerous applications for the Smith-
sonian seat, which had necessarily been held pending, were taken up
for consideration. The question as to the renewal of the lease for
another term of years is now receiving careful consideration, and will
be decided before the expiration of the present contract.

The Secretary visited the Naples Station during the summer and
was pleased with the investigations carried on there. The Smith-
sonian Institution, through its cooperation in this work, has been
brought in touch with many institutions of learning in the United
States, but it is to be hoped that it may receive from some extraneous
source the means of continuing this lease for the benefit of all Ameri-
ran biologists, which if renewed must divert to this useful but extrane-
ous purpose funds needed for others.

In November, 1901, Dr. C. W. Prentiss, to whom a traveling Parker
Fellowship had been awarded by Harvard University, applied for and
received the appointment to the Smithsonian seat in the Naples Station
for March, April, and May, 1902. Being reappointed Parker Fellow
while in residence at Naples, Dr. Prentiss asked for a prolongation of
his term through the months of June and July. The unavoidable
delay in replying to this request, caused by the uncertainty as to the
extension of the lease, was not allowed to work to the disadvantage of
the applicant by Dr. Dohrn, who kindly invited him to continue his
occupancy until a decision was reached by the Institution.

Numerous other applicants were also, to my regret, kept in uncer-
tainty in regard to their appointments, but although this fact finally
brought three and even four Smithsonian appointees to Naples at the
same time, and for an extended period, they were all courteously
arranged for by the obliging director of the station. The details of
these appointments will receive mention in the report for the coming
year, to which they belong and are accredited. It may be added that
numerous applications, for periods beyond the present extension of
the lease, are now held for action, awaiting a decision as to its renewal.

The Secretary desires to express again his appreciation of the ready
and efficient aid rendered him year after year by the advisory com-
mittee in the examination of credentials and in recommendations as to
appointments.
sy REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has continued to carry on various biological and
ethnological explorations through the medium of the National Museum
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, and has also cooperated with
the Executive Departments in these directions. The details of most
of these explorations are given in the paragraphs devoted to the sev-
eral bureaus.

PUBLICATIONS.

In the publications of the Institution the double aim of its founder
is represented—that it should exist for (1) the ‘t increase” and (2) the
‘diffusion’ of knowledge.

The recording of results of original researches, the znerease of
knowledye, is chiefly through the series of Contributions to Knowl-
edge, a quarto work begun in 1848, and in which more than 140 valu-
able memoirs, collected in 32 volumes, have so far been published.
To this series has been added during the year a memoir by Dr. Carl
Barus giving the results of his experiments in ionized air, the investi-
gation having been aided by a grant from the Hodgkins fund, as
mentioned above.

The first edition of one of the memoirs of Contributions, published
in 1891, showing the results of the Secretary’s experiments in aero-
dynamics, having become exhausted, a second edition has been printed
from the stereotype plates, with a few additional observations.

To the series of Miscellaneous Coileections, in octavo form, have
been added a List of Observatories, a work on the Literature of
Manganese, and an Index to the Literature of the Spectroscope.

The Contributions and Miscellaneous Collections, being printed at
the expense of the Smithsonian income, are necessarily published in
limited editions of 1,500 copies, which are distributed as widely as pos-
sible to the larger libraries and institutions of the world. The total
distribution of these during the year was 11,645 volumes and memoirs.

The Smithsonian Report is the only publication issued in large num-
bers, the edi ion being at present about 12,000 copies, 7,000 of which
are placed at the disposal of the Institution, the remaining 5,000 being
distributed by Congress or to depositories designated by law. This
work is published at the expense of the Government and has come to
be in such great popular demand that the entire edition of the 1900
report, of which the general distribution was made in October, 1901,
was exhausted in a few months, even before the 1901 report could
be made ready for the printer.

The volume is primarily a Report of the Board of Regents to Con-
gress concerning the operations and expenditures during the year, and
includes the Proceedings of the Regents’ meeting in January of each
year, the financial report of the executive committee, the report of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ies:

the Secretary, giving an account of the vear’s work, and a general
| appendix. Its appendix, however, forms a distinct and popular part
of the work and is one of the principal methods employed by the
Institution in the d/fus‘on of Knowledge. In the appendix are pub-
lished a large number—sometimes as many as 50—papers of publie
interest.
The Secretary has said elsewhere: **’These papers have a purpose
stinct from any others published by the Institution. They are only
casionally original contributions to science. They are not for the
rofessional reader only, or even chiefly, but they are addressed to that
iree body of the public which has a general interest in scientific mat

oa

rs without special knowledge. While it is always a recommendation

it they should have been written by recognized authorities, yet this is

ininor importance if the articles are sound expositions of the sub-

t. The essential thing is that they should be not only sound and

tructive, but timely and interesting to the nonprofessional reader,

id in that good sense popular. Tf they are accompanied by illustra-

ms, all the better. As they are intended to serve as a kind of

oular survey of the whole field of the sciences, both physical and
logical, for the current year, it is, as a rule, impracticable to print
iore than one paper on any particular subject.”

A portion of the edition of the report is distributed in the form of
pamphlets of individual papers, and where any of these are of
particular interest additional copies are printed at the expense of the
Institution. Of the 1901 report 23,750 copies of separate papers have
thus been ordered for special distribution.

It is impossible to meet the great demand from individuals for the
reports, more than 5,000 copies being required to supply a selected list
of libraries and institutions of learning, fo which the work has been
regularly sent for many years. The total distribution of volumes or
separate parts of reports during the past fiscal year agereeated
40,998.¢

This publication, then, is distributed not only to a large number of
libraries throughout the world, but it is also addressed to as many as
possible of the hundreds of individual applicants of all classes who
seem eager to learn of the world’s advance in the several branches of

knowledge. It is by these reports, which are in a good sense popular,
as well as by its original scientific works, that the Institution grows
each year better known as one of those whose influence for good is
limited by no boundary, but, as its motto declares, goes ** throughout
the world.” In this the Secretary has for some years past imitated
the action of his honored predecessor, Henry, in giving a great deal
of his personal attention to its editorship, with a view to making it of
more popular interest, and he has been gratified at the large demand
just referred to, with which the result of his labors has been met.

In addition to the preceding publications by the Institution proper,
a considerable number of works, chiefly on biological topics, have
been added to the Museum series.

Of the publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
second part of the Eighteenth Report for the fiscal year 1896-97
was distributed, also the separate papers of the Nineteenth Report
for 1897-98. The manuscripts of the Twentieth, Twenty-first, and
Twenty-second Reports for the years 1899 to 1901 were transmitted
to the printer during the last half of the fiscal year.

Mention may also be made of a special edition of Volume I of the
Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, reprinted from a Senate
document of which it formed a part. This document” consisted of a
volume of 339 pages and 44 plates, submitted to Congress in response
to the following item in the sundry civil act of March 3, 1901: ‘*That
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is directed to report to
Congress on the first day of the next regular session an entire
account of all appropriations heretofore expended by the Astro-
physical Observatory, what results have been reached, and what is
the present condition of the work of said Observatory.”

The Secretary during the year transmitted to Congress the Annual
Report of the American Historical Association for the year 1901, and
also the Fourth Report of the National Society of the Daughters of
the American Revolution. The Institution has no share in the dis-
tribution of the latter report, only the ‘‘ usual” document number
(1,682) being printed. Of the Historical Reports a limited number,
beginning with the 1894 report, have been at the disposal of the Insti-
tution for distribution to the larger historical societies of the world
in exchange for their publications.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress
during the year were 1,678 volumes, 20,834 parts of volumes, 3,732
pamphlets, and 414 charts, or a total of 26,658, extending the accession
numbers to 445,523. The libraries of the Secretary’s office, and of

“Senate Document No. 20, Fifty-seventh Congress, first session.
'

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

the Astrophysical Observatory were also increased by £96 volumes
and 2,587 parts of volumes.

A very complete and valuable collection of books and pamphlets
relating to Napoleon Bonaparte has been presented to the Institution
by Gen. John Watts de Peyster, and will be known as the ** Watts de
Peyster Collection, Napoleon Bonaparte.” The 2,000 volumes in this
series are from many countries and in many languages.

The Smithsonian Art Room, placed in general charge of the librarian,
has been made attractive by a rearrangement of the cases containing
the valuable engravings and books on art belonging to the Institution,
and steps have been taken for exhibiting a reproduction of the Parthe-
non frieze around the entire room.

Several years ago the Secretary organized an employees’ library,
which has proved to be very popular, and a branch has been established
in the National Zoological Park.

The accessions to the National Museum Library were 19,553 books,
pamphlets, and periodicals. Its crowded condition has been relieved
by the addition of galleries, making a total floor space of 2,502 square
feet. Thirty sectional libraries are established in the departments of
the Museum, thus making readily accessible to those in charge of the
several branches of scientific research the books directly pertaining
to their work, while the administration of these sectional libraries is
under the control of the Museum librarian.

Since the Secretary’s last report, considerable work has been done
in the maintenance of the International Catalogue of Scientific Liter-
ature, an allotment from the Institution’s fund permitting the estab-
lishment of a regional bureau. An annual appropriation of about
$10,000 is needed for the United States Regional Bureau, and it is
hoped that Congress may provide such an amount for the accomplish-
ment of this undertaking, so important to every branch of scientific
learning, a work that no single institution could be expected to carry
forward. The importance of the catalogue and the methods of its
preparation have been fully explained in previous reports.

CORRESPONDENCE.

Though the correspondence of the Institution has increased during
the year, it has been promptly dispatched and the routine is not in
arrears. This correspondence embraces not only communications
referring to the work of the Institution proper, but also to the National
Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau of American Ethnol-
ogy, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory.
Such matters as require the personal attention of the Secretary, or
relate to the business of the parent Institution are retained in the
Institution, while communications relating to the work of the bureaus
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

are referred to the proper officials for recommendations to the Secre-
tary or for direct reply.

The system of recording and distributing letters has been unchanged
since 1890, except in a few unimportant particulars. Every letter
receives a reply, which is sent as promptly as the circumstances may
allow. The matters of inquiry are perhaps more varied and embrace
a wider range of topics than obtains in other departments of the Gov-
ernment. A register is kept of such letters as are of importance, in
which is noted in each instance the date of the letter, its subject, the
official to whom referred for attention, the date of reply, and the place
of filing. The letters are filed alphabetically, with a notation of each
on a card catalogue, giving a brief synopsis of its contents. The
papers relating to certain special matters are kept separately in a
series of smaller file boxes.

In preparing the correspondence involved in the distribution of pub-
lications much labor is saved by the use of printed mailing cards, often
requiring only the insertion of the name and address of the person for
whom intended.

The correspondence relating to civil-service matters has grown
steadily since the bureaus of the Institution were placed under the
operation of the civil-service law in 1896, and a separate series of
press-copy books and a separate file of letters relating to such matters
are kept, as well as a special file for the reception of papers not relating
directly to the personnel of the several bureaus.

EXPOSITIONS.

Buffalo and Charleston expositions.—The Institution and its bureaus
participated in the Pan-American Exposition held at Buffalo from May
1 to November 1, 1901, and by authority of the President the exhibits
there displayed were transferred to the South Carolina Interstate and
West Indian Exposition held at Charleston from December 1, 1901,
to May 31, 1902. Dr. F. W. True, of the National Museum, was
appointed by the Secretary to represent the Institution on the board
in charge of the Government exhibits at both these expositions, and
his report on the Buffalo Exposition will be found in the Appendix.

Lowsiana Purchase Exposition.—Congress having made an appro-
priation for a Government building and exhibit at the exposition to
be held in St. Louis in 1904, the Secretary has appointed Dr. True to
represent the Institution and its bureaus in the preparation and
installation of the exhibits.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Laird statue.—Several petitions having been presented to the
Senate at its last session for the erection of a statue to Prof. Spencer
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Lt

F. Baird, the second Secretary of this Institution, and an eminent
naturalist, it seems proper to recall that a bill was introduced in the
Senate on December 12, L887, by Senator Morrill appropriating the
sum of $15,000 for a statue in bronze of Professor Baird. The bill
was referred to the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, from which it was reported on December 21 of the same
year, and passed by the Senate on February 9, 1888. On February 13
it was referred to the House Committee on the Library, from which
it failed of report.

Senator Morrill afterwards reported for the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1890,
appropriating the sum above mentioned for the erection of the statue.
The amendment was referred to the Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee, but was not included in the bill as sna from the committee.

The Secretary called attention to the matter in his reports for the
years 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1894, where the hope was expressed
that the bill would receive favorable consideration.

National gallery of American art.—A bill having been introduced
in Congress at its last session for the construction of a national gal-
lery of art, the attention of Senator Penrose, who presented the bill,
was called to the fact that section 5586 of the Revised Statutes speci-
fies, among other things, that whenever suitable arrangements can be
made from time to time for their reception, all objects of art belong-
ing to the United States shall be delivered to such persons as may be
authorized by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to
receive them, and so arranged and classified in the building erected
for the Institution as best to facilitate their examination and study.
In compliance with this provision of law the Institution has for many
years maintained a collection of art objects, to which has been added
from to time, by gift and purchase, paintings, bronzes, etc., though
with its limited fund the acquisitions by purchase have not been
numerous. It was suggested to Senator Penrose that should there be
any likelihood of the passage of the bill the Smithsonian Institution,
which has always concerned itself with art, would be the natural custo-
dian of a national gallery. The bill is still pending, and will probably
come up for action during the next session of Congress.

International Zoological Congr ss. —At the Fifth International Zoo-
logical Congress held in Berlin, Germany, August 12-16, 1901, the
Institution was represented by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, of the National
Museum, who reports as follows:

The congress was opened on August 12, and lasted until August 16,
when the ‘eles: ates and members: “adjourned to attend the reception
given in their honor by the High Senate of Hamburg. It was in every
respect a success. One of the main factors of this success was the
unexampled interest in the congress displayed by the German Goyern-
ment. A large sum of money was placed at the disposition of the com-

mittee by the Government, and the German Crown Prince, as the high
protector of the congress, was only prevented from opening the con-
gress In person by the death of his grandmother, the Empress Fried-
rich, a few days previous. The congress was lavishly entertained by
the cities of Berlin and Hamburg, as ‘well as by the Zoological Society
of Berlin. But the most extraordinary proof ‘of the public interest in
the congress was probably the fact that the entire *‘ Reichstagsg¢ebaiide,”
the magnificent house of the German Parliament, was placed : at its dis-
position for its meetings, lectures, etc. Thus all the general sessions
were held in the great ¥ Plenarsitsungssaal” of the Parliament. The
Emperor himself, though prevented from receiy ing the members ofhi-
cially on account of the death of his mother, took occasion to ereet
them informally.

The more special object of my joining the congress was to take
part in the deliberations and decisions of the committee on zoological
nomenclature, of which I had been elected a member at the congress
in Cambridge in 1898. The work in this committee on nomenclature
was, on the whole, eminently satisfactory from the standpoint of
American zoologists, though it was found impossible to lay a draft for
a complete code for the congress at its Berlin meeting. It is hoped
that this will be accomplished at the next congress Ww hich is to be held
in Bern, Switzerland, in 1904.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Museum, established in the fundamental act creating the Smith-
sonian Institution, grew up largely from its private collections, but it
is important to consider that now it has grown into something which
represents more nearly the large purpose of Congress in its foundation
and that it is becoming a ‘* National” Museum. — It differs from most
other museums in that its primary function was held to be not so much
the entertainment or instruction of the resident population as the
preservation and arrangement of the collections brought together by
the Government of the United States. These collections now out-
number by some millions of specimens those which it has been possible
to place upon exhibition in the present utterly inadequate quarters.

I know that the wish of those in immediate charge of the collections
is that they may contribute, among other important ends, to establish
not only a real educational museum, but one which will interest not
only the inhabitants of Washington, but the great numbers of Ameri-
van citizens annually visiting the capital; but this is impossible under
the present limitations of space and means. These exhibition features,
then, though not the primary purpose of the museum, are for the edu-
cation and interest of all American citizens, and as accessions come in
they require constant change and careful study to bring them to the
comprehension of all Americans of all ages and all grades of education.

The definition of an educational museum made by the late Dr.

Goode, as ‘*a collection of well-written labels with carefully selected
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

specimens attached,” brings forward the difficulty of the preparation
of such a museum, since to compress into afew sentences, in simple
yet accurate language, comprehensive and interesting information
concerning any specimen presupposes a depth of knowledge and a
facility in expression possessed by but few. This task of working
upon and improving the educational features of the museum is never
ending, and it should be so, for “a perfect museum is a finished
museum, and a finished museum is a dead museum.”

Collections placed upon exhibition must be constantly renewed, since
they deteriorate by the very exposure to the light. The art of taxi-
dermy, methods of installation, the choice of colors for backgrounds,
the style and form of labels—all of these details, unnoticed by the casual
visitor; matters of constant study to the expert—together form the
whole upon which either the pleasant or unpleasant impressions car-
ried away by the visitor depend, but all this is labor lost if they are
in situations so crowded as to resemble storage rather than exhibition
halls.

Excepting as to improvement in these details, the National Museum,
so far as its exhibition halls is concerned, has reached its maximum
development in its present quarters. The Secretary has, year after
year, continued to call attention to the serious overcrowding of the
Museum, and in his report for last year considered the question fully.
He is pleased to be able to state that the special appeals made to the
last session of Congress by the committee of the Regents resulted in
the passage of the following item:

For the preparation, under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, of preliminary plans for an additional fire-
proof steel-frame brick and terra cotta building, to cost not exceed-
ing one million five hundred thousand dollars, for the United States
National Museum, to be erected when appropriated for, on the Mall,
between Ninth and Twelfth streets west, said plans when completed
to be transmitted by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to
Congress, five thousand dollars.

And it is hoped that the erection of a building may be authorized by
the next Congress. This is not the place to discuss the requirements
of such a building. In the course of the next session of Congress a
detailed statement will be laid before that body indicating the needs,
both for exhibition, storage, laboratory, and the numerous other
accessories Which go to make up a great modern museum. Vast as
have been the improvements in the erection of museums in the past
twenty years, the ideal standard of building, in which all the requisite
features are adequately provided for, has not yet been created in any
country in the world. It can hardly be expected that the sum indi-
cated in the above item would be sufficient to supply perfect interior
arrangements for exhibition and working purposes, coupled with that

.
20) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

dignity of exterior which has come to be associated with the buildings
erected by the Government of the United States.

The Secretary has, however, frequently adverted to the fact that
it is not bricks and mortar, nor, even, cases and specimens that
make the museum, but (more important than these) the learning and
enthusiasm of the men who bring together and classify and describe
these collections. Of such men there is an inadequate number, and
all are inadequately paid. While wages of laborers and mechanics
and the cost of living to all men have advanced by leaps and bounds,
the salaries of the scientific staff of the Government, and more
especially of the Museum, have to a great extent been kept at a
stationary level. The increase in the number of museums, the increase
in the number of colleges and universities, the increase in their endow-
ments have all put a premium, as it were, upon the services of men of
the first rank, and it is the real devotion of the Museum staff, and not
the pecuniary reward which they have received, that has preserved
to the Government the services of this distinguished, zealous, and
effective, but wholly underpaid body of men.

The best of the scientific staff of the Museum are retained not
merely by the unselfishness of their interest in science, but because
they can remain there without the duties of tuition, which attach to
higher salaries that they can receive in colleges. But they can not
be expected to remain indefinitely when so much better terms are
being daily held out to them elsewhere.

The Secretary has repeatedly drawn the attention of Congress to
the need of the Museum for an increase in the item under ‘* preserva-
tion of collections” for the purpose of making at least small advances
in the salaries of the staff, and in the estimates submitted this year he
has determined to sacrifice needed improvements in many directions
with the hope that, on this single item, Congress may see its way clear
to approve his recommendation.

To relieve the congestion in some of the most crowded exhibition
halls, and to permit the display of a few more of the objects taken
from storage, Congress authorized the construction of galleries which
have also been found well adapted as temporary laboratories in sey-
eral departments, and for extension of the Museum library.

The number of specimens received during the year was about
450,000, making the total number of objects nearly five and a half mil-
lion. The more important additions and general details concerning
the several departments are given in an appendix in the report of the
Assistant Secretary.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Researches among the native American tribes were continued by
the Bureau of American Ethnology, under the supervision of Maj.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

J. W. Powell, Director, by means of the usual Congressional appro-
priation, the formal plan of operations having been approved by the
Secretary of the Institution.

The work of the Bureau has related largely toa study of the origin,
physical and mental characteristics, arts and industries, food supply,
social and political institutions, religions, and languages of these tribes.

A considerable share of attention has been given to distinctly prac-
tical questions—relating to the aborigines—to tribal distribution, to
subsequent movements and locations of the tribes, to the laws relating
to their welfare and their relations to the Government, to treaties, to
cessions and recessions of territory.

It has seemed desirable for many years that there should be arranged
and published in some methodical form an encyclopedia or dictionary
of Indian tribes for which much material has been accumulated, and
which it has been intended should present a complete account of them
as grouped by linguistic stocks. This is expected to prove of great
service to Congress.and to public men generally, as well as to institu-
tions of learning, but in view of the time which this great work may
be expected to take, the immediate preparation and publication of a
dictionary of ready reference to all that is most useful in the past
work of the Bureau has been determined upon as the most necessary
publication and work of the Bureau in the immediate future.

Field work was conducted by the regular force of the Bureau in
Alaska, Arizona, California, and in several other States and Territo-
ries, as also in British Columbia, Mexico, Greenland, and in Porto
Rico, while useful information and material was obtained from corre-
spondents and special collaborators. Special attention was devoted to
a study of those aboriginal industries which appeared to bear practical
relations to modern life, particularly to aboriginal methods of house
building and irrig
regions that formerly sustained a population five to ten times larger
than at the present day. A noteworthy investigation of aboriginal
industries was conducted in Porto Rico, and a special report of the
native resources of that island is in preparation,

A special study was made of a ceremony among the Pawnee Indians

ation, and to food sources in those tropical and arid

embracing songs of interest in the development of music and poetry,
and to early phases of the drama, the memoir being accompanied by
the primitive music recorded. by the aid of the graphophone, and with
photographs of movements and objects introduced in the ceremony.

A notable collection of chipped implements, teeth and bones of an
extinct elephant, together with a remarkable series of teeth and bones
of the mastodon, besides remains of buffalo, deer, horse, and other
animals of the historic period, was obtained from a spring in the north-
eastern Indian Territory. The association of fossil remains with human
implements was puzzling until a critical examination by Mr. W. H.
Holmes, verified-through the memory of an aged Indian chief, indicated
Ca

that the spring was a shrine at which aboriginal hunters accumulated
votive offerings.

Other researches were carried on and several publications were
prepared, as mentioned in detail in the Appendix.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The objects and methods of the International Exchange Service
were so fully explained in the Secretary’s report for last year that it
seems unnecessary to again refer to them further than to say that the
service is the medium of exchange of the official publications of the
United States Government with the governments of the larger foreign
powers of the world, and also the medium of exchange between the
principal scientific institutions and libraries of the world.

The maintenance of the American branch of the service is now met
in the main by Government appropriations, though the Smithsonian
Institution continues to bear a considerable share of the expenses.

During the last fiscal year there was handled an aggregate of
125,796 packages, weighing 396,418 pounds, the packages sent abroad
numbering 87,149 and those received from foreign countries 38,647.
The various classes of exchanges and other details of the service are
explained in detail in the report of the Acting Curator in the Appendix.

It has long seemed desirable to establish more adequate exchange
relations with Japan and China, but efforts in that direction have so
far been without success. In Great Britain, Germany, and Austria-
Hungary it is still necessary to employ salaried agents to carry on the
work, the Governments of those countries for various reasons not yet
having organized international exchange bureaus.

Congress having made a slight increase in the annual appropriation,
it has been possible to considerably improve the service by sending
packages by fast express steamers rather than by the slow lines, an
advantage much appreciated by all concerned, for in these days of
rapid transit on sea and land the literary, scientific, and political world,
as well as the business world, is eager to participate in all the advan-
tages of quick transportation.

Five years ago, in 1897, the total number of correspondents or par-
ticipants in the exchange service was 28,008, while the aggregate has
now reached 38,200 addresses of libraries and individuals in 154 coun-
tries scattered all over the civilized world, even in some of the
remotest corners of India, Asia, Australia, and Polynesia.

The general benefit of the service to the scientific world can hardly
be measured. Largely as a result of these international exchanges
there has accumulated in the Library of Congress a mass of scientific
and Government publications that is probably not surpassed any where,
and which could scarcely have been secured in any other way.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. JS

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The importance and interest of the National Zoological Park, under
the care of the Regents, is constantly increasing, the total number of
visitors for the past year being estimated at nearly a million, the num-
ber on single days having several times passed 30,000,

The Secretary has in previous years called the attention of the
Regents to the want of a Congressional appropriation for collecting
and preserving some of the great land and marine specimens of our
Western territory now rapidly approaching extinction, and he again
urges the immediate need of doing something, even on the smallest

oO
om)

scale, before it is entirely too late. He hopes that Congress may be
asked to provide the means to meet these wants by the establishment
of at least two small stations or ranches in Alaska, one in the interior,
where may be secured specimens of the great moose, the great bear,
and other disappearing animals of the land fauna; the other ** ranch”
to be on the coast for the collection of the walrus, the sea otter, the
great sea lion of Steller, and other important vanishing marine species.

The animals in the National Zoological Park at the close of the fiscal
year included 506 mammals, 232 birds, and 145 reptiles. The acces-
sions of the year numbered 314. More than half of these accessions
were gifts to the Government, several of the most interesting animals
having been secured through the cooperation of United States consuls
and other officials. A fine specimen of grizzly bear, also some ante-
lope, deer, elk, and cinnamon bears were received from the Yellowstone
National Park.

The native game, everywhere plenty when the needs of the park
were first submitted to Congress, has grown so nearly inaccessible
that only after years of effort have there at last been procured a sine le
young male specimen of the great Kodiak bear and two big hora or
Rocky Mountain sheep.

The principal improvements to the park, mentioned in detail in the
report of the superintendent on a subsequent page, include the com-
pletion of the large flying cage, an addition to the tempovary bird
house, and an extension or completion of some of the roadways.
Work was begun on a new elephant house for which Congress at its
last session made an appropriation of SLO,Q00,

Among the present needs of the park, after that for securing native
game, are adequate provision for housing tropical mammals, an aqua-
rium, a reptile house, an aviary for sinall terrestrial birds, and, for the
wolves and foxes, which are now in temporary quarters, permanent
pens from which they may be unable to escape.

There is no department of the park in which the public takes more
interest than in the aquarium, for, notwithstanding the imperfect char-
acter of the installation, the tanks being set up in a mere temporary

24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

shed, it is always frequented by visitors. It would undoubtedly be
desirable to greatly extend and perfect this collection, so that the pub-
lic might more completely realize the multifarious living forms that
are found in the waters about our coasts, as well as in our rivers and
lakes. In order to do this properly a suitable building should be
provided and fitted with permanent tanks, heating and refrigerating
apparatus, and open pools.

The educational value of an exhibit of this character would unques-
tionably be very great. Land animals are more commonly seen, and
therefore do not excite the wonder that do those creatures that live in
an element by which they are most wholly screened from view. The
life of the waters is therefore always extremely interesting and sur-
prising.

A zoological collection, viewed in its widest extent, can not be said
to bee omplete while f failing to exhibit so large and important a portion
of the zoological domain. The biological sciences are becoming more
and more studied in our schools, and it is well known that the simpler
forms of invertebrates are extremely important as an introduction to
the knowledge of higher forms. Classes from the schools of this city
and elsewhere often visit the park and find great profit in the aquarium
exhibit, even in its present incomplete state. It is hoped that Congress
may grant funds for establishing in the park an aquarium on a proper
scale.

The park is fulfilling sucessfully the objects for which Congress cre-
ated it, ** The advancement of science and the instruction and recreation
of the people.” It never has been so successful in these as it is to-day.

THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

In appropriating in the sundry civil act, approved March 3, 1901,
the sum of $12,000 for the maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the control of the Smithsonian Institution, during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, Congress added the following words:

That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution is directed to
report to Congress on the first day of the next regular session an entire
account of all: appropriations heretofore expended by the Astrophys-
ical Observatory, what results have been reached, and what is the
present condition of the work of said Observatory.

In response to this requirement the Secretary submitted a report
embracing (1) an entire account of all appropriations heretofore
expended by the Astrophysical Observatory, (2) a statement of the
results which have been reached, and (8) the present condition of the
work of said Observatory, and including as a part of it the first vol-
ume of its Annals. This report was accompanied by letters from Sir
Robert Ball, Sir William Huggins, Lord Kelvin, Sir Norman Lockyer,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

Lord Rayleigh, Sir George Stokes, and other eminent foreign men of
science, whose appreciation could not be charged with being influenced
by national prejudice, as well-as by equally disinterested American
ones, all showing a very gratifying approbation of the work of the
Observatory by those best competent to judge its merits.

The principal work of the Astrophysical Observatory during the
past year has continued to be the study of the sun and its radiation.
While fully acknowledging the interesting nature of astrophysical
investigation of the stars and nebule, the study of the sun has a far
superior practical importance, for were the former bodies to be wholly
blotted out they would be missed chiefly as objects of scientific inter-
est, while with the sun would be abolished life itself. The solar
researches of the past year have mainly been concerned with deter-
mining the amount and nature of the absorption of solar radiation in
the earth’s atmosphere and in the solar envelope. These researches
are preliminary to and form an essential part of the measurement of
the total radiation of the sun. A presumption exists, almost amount-
ing to certainty, that the total radiation of the sun is variable in some
relation to the appearance of sun spots, but nothing is yet known to
definitely fix the amount of this supposed variability or to measure
its effect upon the earth, though that effect, if so fixed, can not but be
of interest to every inhabitant of the earth’s surface.

The instrumental means, which thus have been the subject of inces-
sant study and improvement here during the past ten years, for inves-
tigating such questions, are more efficient than at any previous time.
It will be seen from the detailed report of the aid acting in charge that
automatic bolometric curves accurately representative of the amount
and distribution of the solar energy at the observer's station may now
be obtained in a few minutes, covering nearly the whole spectral region
which reaches sea level, and where occurs much of the great and
varying absorption by water vapor which influences our terrestrial
temperatures so greatly,

Some twenty years ago the writer invented a then new instrument
for measuring minute quantities of heat, for, owing to circumstances
which this is not the place to detail, an accurate determination of the
possible variation in the enormous quantities of heat which the sun
sends the earth depends (paradoxically) upon the ability to measure
smaller quantities of heat than the most delicate thermometer can
possibly do. The * bolometer,” the instrument of the writer’s inven-
tion, which is in question, was able to measure the then unheard of
quantity of somewhat more than one one-hundred-thousandth of a
degree. Since then, during fifteen years of constant advance, latterly
associated with a great improvement of the adjuncts, particularly of
the galvonometer, at the hands of Mr. Abbot, this has been brought
to measure somewhat less than one one-hundred-millionth of a degree,

Y
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and this almost infinitesimal amount is distinguished with readiness
and precision. It is this increased precision which is associated with
all the improvements in the work of the year here described.

It is the variability of the absorption of our air which now offers
the greatest difficulty to the work. The Secretary cherishes the hope
that a solar observatory will one day be established high ina clear and
dry air, whose chief aim shall be to solve the questions of the amount
of radiation of the sun, the changes in this total amount, and the con-
sequences of such changes on the earth.

The interest of this solar study is peculiar among all the subjects of
astronomical research, for it is not only a scientific but a utilitarian
interest of such high importance that it has among its remote possibili-
ties the forecasting of the coming seasons and harvests, and of conditions
immediately practical, from those which affect the price of the laborer’s
dinner up to those which, to use the weighty words of Professor New-
comb, may bring to light not merely interesting cosmical processes, but
‘*cosmical processes pregnant with the destiny of our race.”

In connection with these researches it has proved necessary to
obtain a large solar image as free as possible from defects of definition
and unequal absorption. One of the most formidable of these defects
is that which astronomers call ** boiling.” This consists of an apparent
wavy and rolling motion over the image, and is due to momentary
differences of density of the air in the path of the beam. It has
hitherto been sought (with little effect) to control this by keeping the
air in the tube as still as possible.

Tam much interested in a new plan which I have myself proposed,
that of thoroughly and incessantly stirring this air column even while
the rays forming the telescopic image are passing through it. This
experiment of stirring the air has been tried during the past few
months at the Observatory, and has resulted in the discovery that by
vigorously churning the column of air traversed by the solar beam
from a point about 50 feet above the apparatus to the point where the
image is formed, the paradoxical result is reached that this image itself
becomes nearly tranquil, and that thus the ‘* boiling” can be nearly
all eliminated. It is hoped that this very important observation will
prove useful to astronomers generally.

For details of the work of the Observatory, including many inter-
esting subjects in addition to those I have mentioned, the reader is
referred to the report of the aid acting in charge, which appears in
the Appendix.

NECROLOGY.

The Institution has lost by death its presiding officer, ex officio,
William McKinley, President of the United States. The life and
work of that honored and eminent man and the tragic circumstances
of his death are in all minds and they need not be repeated here.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 27

Anearly Regent of the Institution, the Hon. Matthew Gault Emery
died October 12, 1901. Erom June, 1870, to June, 1871, he was
mayor of Washington anda member of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution as then organized. At the time of his death
he was a prominent citizen, particularly in the financial business of
the capital city.

Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archie-
ology in the National Museum, died May 4, 1902. He had been con-
nected with the Museum for thirteen years and was a most earnest
worker. He became widely known by his studies and contributions
to the literature of anthropology.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sir: [I have the honor to submit the following report on the condition and opera-
tions of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1902:

Though having as its primary function the preservation and classification of the
Government collections, the National Museum is best known to the public by its
educational features, the most obvious of these being the illustration of nature and
of the arts of man by means of carefully selected series of objects appropriately
labeled and arranged in its exhibition halls in the city of Washington. Its educa-
tional work, however, reaches out to all parts of the country through the distribu-
tion of its duplicate specimens and the dissemination of knowledge through its
publications and by its correspondence. The collections have long since outgrown
the accommodations provided for them, and for some years the bulk of the material
received has gone into storage. It is, therefore, very gratifying to note the dispo-
sition of Congress, manifested at its last session, to grant funds for the erection of a
new building.

The accessions during the past year have increased the total number of specimens
to above 5,000,000. Besides this, nearly 700 lots of specimens were sent to the
Museum from all parts of the country for identification and report, and several thou-
sand letters asking for information on scientific subjects have been received and
answered.

There has been a large increase over former years in the amount of duplicate
material distributed as gifts to educational establishments and sent out in exchange
for an equivalent return, the total number of specimens so disposed of having
exceeded 30,000. In addition to the routine duties connected with the care and
classification of the collections, much important scientific work has been accom-
plished by the Museum staff, and the facilities of the Museum for conducting
researches have been availed of by many persons not connected with the establish-
ment. Over 6,000 specimens were also lent to specialists for study at their own
laboratories.

The number of persons who visited the Museum during the year was 173,888.

Buildings.—The Museum occupies for its various purposes the greater part of the
Smithsonian building, the adjacent large brick building, erected about 1880 for its
special use, parts of three detached buildings on the Smithsonian and Armory reser-
vations, and several rented buildings south of B street SW. The Smithsonian and
Museum buildings are mainly filled with the exhibition collections, but contain also
the offices and laboratories and the reference and study collections, so far as it has
been possible to accommodate them. The preparators’ workrooms and the general
storage are mostly outside.

The reports for many years have called attention to the overcrowding in every
branch of the Museum. In some of the exhibition halls there are scarcely passage-
ways for visitors between the cases; the reserve series of specimens comprising the

.

30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

chief scientific wealth of the collections are, to a great extent, barely accessible and
their proper arrangement generally impossible; and the laboratories are mostly too
small to permit of laying out specimens in course of study or in preparation for dis-
play. More serious, however, has been the necessity during many years past of stor-
ing very considerable parts of the collections in unsafe buildings, where they are
constantly liable to destruction by fire and certain to deteriorate, being buried
beyond the possibility of suitable care or inspection. It is therefore pleasing to note
that at its last session Congress voted $5,000 for the preparation of preliminary plans
for anew building, which when completed should not only relieve this congested
condition, but also enable the Museum to develop its educational features and con-
duct its activities In a manner more creditable to the nation.

Several important alterations and improvements have been made in the Museum
building. Some additional space has been gained through the construction of gal-
leries in three ranges—the west-north, the north-west, and the south-west, which are
being fitted up for the library and as laboratories for the departments of anthropology

and geology.

The steam boilers, which had become entirely worn-out after a service dating from
the erection of the building, have been replaced by a pair of high-pressure boilers of
modern pattern, with capacity for heating both buildings. The introduction of
these made it necessary to overhaul the entire heating plant and to make new and
more ample connections with the Smithsonian building. The boilers formerly used
in the latter building will be retained in place to guard against emergencies, and the
employment of one set instead of two is expected to result in the economy of both
fuel and labor.

The installation of a complete system of eleectric-light wiring and fixtures extend-
ing to all the exhibition halls as well as to the offices, laboratories, and storerooms,
begun the previous year, was finished satisfactorily. Should it be decided to open
the building at night, however, an increased appropriation will be required to cover
the cost of extra current and the pay of several additional attendants.

The quarters allotted to the purposes of a lunch room haye been somewhat extended
and improved, but this very desirable museum adjunct must always remain poorly
provided for in the present building.

Organization and staf?.—The organization of the museum comprises an administra-
tive office and three scientific departments, as follows: Anthropology, with 8 divi-
sions and 4 sections; Biology, with 9 divisions and 12 sections; and Geology, with 3
divisions and 8 sections.

3esides the three head curators in charge of the departments, the scientific staff at
the close of the year consisted of 17 curators, 12 assistant curators, 14 custodians, 11
aids, + associates, and 2 collaborators, making a total of 65 persons, of whom, how-
ever, only about one-half received compensation from the Museum. Of the re-
mainder, who are serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity, the majority were
attached to other scientific bureaus of the Government.

The death of Dr. Thomas Wilson, which occurred on May 4, 1902, deprived the
Museum of one of its most earnest and helpful workers. Widely distinguished for
his studies and contributions on a variety of anthropological subjects, Dr. Wilson’s
interests lay chiefly in the field of prehistoric archeology, and from 1889 he had
charge of the extensive and important collections of this division of the Museum.

Mr. William V. Cox, who was appointed to the Museum in 1879, and has been its
chief clerk since 1886, with important duties in connection with all the recent expo-
sitions in which the Government has participated, severed his official relations with
the Museum in February, 1902, greatly to the regret of his associates, to accept a
more responsible position elsewhere. The duties of this office have been somewhat
modified to better consolidate the administrative work, and the title of its chief

officer has been changed to administrative assistant. This position was filled by the
appointment of Mr. W. de C. Ravenel, previously the assistant in charge of fish cul-
ture in the United States Fish Commission, who has joined to a long experience in
the administrative work of that Bureau a familiarity with the preparation and instal-
lation of Government exhibits.

Mr. George B. Turner has been made chief taxidermist and Mr. W. C. Phalen an
aid in the Department of Geology.

Additions to the collections.—The collections of the Museum were increased during
the year to the extent of over 448,000 specimens, bringing the total number of speci-
mens in its possession up to more than 5,400,000. The additions were received in
1,409 separate lots or accessions.

Among the important contributions in the Department of Anthropology were a
quantity of baskets, weapons, ornaments, and parts of costumes collected by Dr.
W. L. Abbott in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and many objects, including
erania, native clothing, lamps, and articles connected with the industries of the
Eskimo, obtained in northern Greenland and Ellesmere Land by Mr. Robert Stein,
of the United States Geological Survey, during his Arctic expedition. A number of
Guatemalan costumes and of objects illustrating the first steps in the weaving of cot-
ton as practiced in that country, as well as other ethnological material, were received
from Mrs. Mary W. Owen, of Panzos, Guatemala. Two interesting donations were
a series of weapons captured during the Philippine insurrection, including several
Filipino swords of the ordinary type, some bolos, and a kris, from Maj. I. L. Hawks,
U.S. Volunteers; and a collection consisting principally of the different types of punal
de kris, a weapon carried by the women and children i: the Philippine Islands,
together with a device formerly used in the Philippine army for decapitating wounded
soldiers, from Dr. W. C. Warmsley, of Norwich, Conn. Another Philippine collec-
tion, secured by purchase from Mr. J. N. Harkins, of Calhoun, Ga., comprises weapons,
cooking utensils, tobacco boxes, charm belts, models of boats, newspapers, statuettes,
and coins.

A collection of choice objects brought together by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode,
and secured during the year, in ludes musical instruments, Japanese porcelains,
domestic utensils, gambling devices, plaques, vases, an incense box, old Kutani
ware, Marcusi ware, Cloisonné plates and bowls, trays, English chinaware, anid
ironstone china from China. Other additions to the collection of musical instru-
ments were a small series of instruments used by the American Indians, and several
from European countries, including a nyckleharpa, obtained by exchange from
Mrs. J. Crosby Brown, of Orange, N. J.; and 78 pieces, comprising instruments of
the Javanese, Chinese, Thibetans, Japanese and Persians; Syrian and Eeyptian
kettledrums, a Turkish mandolin, ete., presented by Dr. Ryan Devereaux, U.S. Army.

A complete set of the gold and silver coins of Siam, and a series of Spanish coins
minted in Mexico and the Philippine Islands, embracing the various kinds issued by
Spain for use in its colonies, were obtained by purchase.

Loan collections, chiefly of historical interest, received on deposit and exhibited in
the main Museum hall, were as follows: Eighty-two relics of Colonial times, and a
gold watch worn by George Fayette Washington, a nephew of George Washington,
from the National Society of Colonial Dames; relics of the Revolutionary War,
including commissions in the Continental Army, trom the Daughters of the American
Revolution; seyeral swords that had belonged to the late Rear Admiral J. W. Philip,
U. $8. Navy, one presented by the children of Texas, another by the citizens of New
York City, from Mrs. Philip; six swords belonging to Rear Admiral R. D. Evans,
U.S. Navy, ineluding one presented by the State of Iowa, and one by the crew of
the battle ship Jowa; and 21 guns captured at Tientsin, China, comprising the various
types of European and American manufacture now employed in the Chinese army,
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

from Col. W. H. Carter, U.S. Army. A desk and quadrant used by Dr. C. F. Hall,
on his Polaris Arctic Expedition, were received as a gift from Miss Anne 8. Hall, of
Cincinnati, Ohio.

Among the important accessions in archzeology were the collection of flint imple-
ments, bone utensils, and remains of extinct and recent mammals resulting from the
examination of a sulphur spring at Afton, Ind. T., by Mr. W. H. Holmes, and a
very large amount of material, comprising pottery, implements of stone, wood and
shell, bones and human remains, obtained by Dr. Walter Hough during his investi-
gations in Arizona, partly in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates.

About 10,000 prehistoric objects from Georgia, including carvings, spearheads, pol-
ished stone hatchets, and other articles of stone, ivory, and pottery, were acquired
from Dr. Roland B. Steiner. A collection of the implements used by the ancient
inhabitants of Columbia County, Pa., consisting of stone articles of domestic utility,
stone hatchets, banner stones, arrow points, and spearheads, was presented by Mr.
Charles Hummel, of Espey, Pa., and a large series of prehistoric objects from the
Potomac Valley was obtained by purchase.

Among the accessions in archzeology from other countries were oyer 600 specimens
of prehistoric vases, stone figures, carvings and polished instruments, and figures and
dishes in earthenware from Mexico, received from Mr. EK. O. Matthews; material
from the guano caves of Las Cruces, New Mexico, contributed by Mr. J. R. De Mier;
an image, mortar and pestle of stone, from Porto Rico, presented by Mr. Henry Bird,
and aseries of flint implements and bones from the cavern of Kesserlock, Schaff-
hausen, Switzerland, donated by Prof. J. Heierli, of the University of Zurich.

The additions to the technological collections include several of historical value,
such as pieces of apparatus devised and used by Dr. Elisha Gray in his experiments
with harmonic multiple telegraphy and with the telephone, received from Mrs.
Gray; one of the tin-foil records made by Edison’s first phonograph when exhibited
before the National Academy of Sciences at the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, con-
tributed by Mr. William J. Rhees; a number of electric lighting and telephone
devices, and one of the early forms of typewriting machines.

In the Department of Biology the collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the
East Indies, consisting principally of mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, formed
the most important zoological accessions. Of mammals there were 848 specimens,
including many new species, from the islands of Andaman, Nicobar, Linga, Sinkep,
Johore, and others farther eastward; of birds, over 700 specimens, and of reptiles, a
considerable number. The region visited by Dr. Abbott is in large part a new field,
not previously represented in the National Museum, and the generous contributions
from this indefatigable explorer give the Museum a collection from this region
which is absolutely unrivaled. e

Other specimens of mammals received, deserving of mention, were a fine skeleton
of the huge Kod‘ak (Alaska) bear, from Mr. J. H. Kidder, of Boston; African ante-
lopes and monkeys from Dr. A. Donaldson Smith, of Philadelphia; many skulls of
moose, elk, and other deer from Mr. Ernest Thompson-Seton of New York; and
large series of small mammals from Germany and of squirrels from Asia.

Among ornithological material were about 300 Cuban and Porto Rican birds, col-
lected by Mr. B. 8. Bowdish; a quantity of Cuban birds collected by Mr. William
Palmer; a series of Mast Indian birds from the Royal Museum of Natural History at
Leiden, Holland; a large number of Brazilian birds from the Museu Paulista at Sao
Paulo, Brazil; besides smaller collections from Mexico, Cocos Island, Hawaii, and

Great Britain. Several rare species of birds’ eggs were obtained.

The reptilian collection was enriched by the field work in Cuba and Porto Rico of
Mr. B. 8. Bowdish and Mr. William Palmer. Specimens were also received from
Japan, Sumatra, and the Philippine Islands.

The Division of Fishes was fortunate in securing, through Messrs. Anderson and
Price, of Ormond, Fla., the skin of a whale shark (Rhinodon), 13 feet long, the first
of its kind recorded as being taken if the North Atlantic Ocean. The Leland Stan-
ford Junior University presented the types of a large number of Japanese fishes
described by Dr. David $8. Jordan, and also specimens from Panama, Cocos Island,
and the Galapagos Islands. A collection of Egyptian fishes from the Nile was con-
tributed by Dr. Bashford Dean, of Columbia University, and interesting material
from several sources was transmitted by the United States Fish Commission.

Twelve species of land shells from Cocos Island, cotypes of species described in
EK. yon Marten’s work onthe mollusks of that locality, were donated by Mr. William
H. Dall. Some 2,000 shells from Lower California were received from Lieut. C. A.
Clarke, U.S. Navy, and a number of new species of North American land shells
from Mr. J. H. Ferris, of Joliet, Ill.

The largest addition to the Division of Insects comprised about 65,000 specimens
collected by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, custodian of the coleoptera in the Museum, in Ari-
zona, at his own expense, and by him presented to the national collections. The
Museum was already indebted to this generous friend for the gift of his extensive
private collection previously formed. Some 7,000 insects of several groups were
brought from the Hawaiian Islands by Mr. W. H. Ashmead, and 10,000 specimens
of lepidoptera from Colorado by Dr. H. G. Dyar, assisted by Mr. A. N. Caudell. The
expeditions on which this material was secured are referred to elsewhere. Ten
thousand beautifully prepared specimens of butterflies, mainly from Mexico and
Central America, have been deposited in the Museum by Mr. William Schaus, of
Twickenham, England.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received from the United States Fish Com-
mission a series of Porto Rican sponges, identified by Dr. H. V. Wilson, of the
University of North Carolina; echini and bolothurians from the same locality, iden-
tified by Prof. H. L. Clark, of Olivet College; the crustaceans and echinoderms col-
lected during the expedition of 1901 to the Hawaiian Islands; and a quantity of material
from the marine station at Woods Hole, Mass. The extensive collection of corals
made some years ago at the Philippine Islands by Prof. J. B. Steere and Prof. Dean ©,
Worcester was obtained by purchase. Among the smaller accessions of importance
were a quantity of marine invertebrates from Ellesmere Land, collected by Mr. Robert
Stein; a series of the cave crustaceans of Kentucky and Tennessee from Prof. W. P.
Hay; a number of Alaskan crustaceans from Mr. R. 8. MeGregor, of the U. 8. Coast
Survey steamer Pathfinder; and samples of the Atlantic sea-bottom from the United
States Navy.

Through the generous bequest of Dr. Charles Mohr, of Asheville, N. C., who died
in July, 1901,,the Division of Plants became possessed of his entire collection of flow-
ering plants, comprising more than 18,000 specimens, chiefly from the southern
United States. Two years previously Dr. Mohr had presented to the Museum his
collection of about 3,000 specimens of cryptogamic plants from the same region.
From his trip to Central America during the summer of 1901 Mr. J. N. Rose brought
back a large number of plants, including specimens from Mount Orizaba and Mount
Popocatepetl, and also some living plants, which were deposited in the greenhouse of
the Department of Agriculture. A valuable collection from China and the Philip-
pine Islands was contributed by the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew, England; over
6,000 plants from various parts of the United States and from Brazil, Guatemala,
Mexico, and Perto Rico were transmitted by the Department of Agriculture; and
about 4,200 Chinese plants were acquired by purchase.

In the Department of Geology the accessions haye been numerous, and in some of
its divisions of more than ordinary importance. Among the rocks and ores trans-
mitted by the United States Geological Survey were many specimens illustrative of

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

its recent explorations in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon. <A large quantity of ore
samples from the United States exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900 was turned
over to the Museum by the Government Board. The minerals added to the collec-
tion comprise many varieties, a number of which were not previously represented.
Especially worthy of mention are a fine specimen of native tellurium from Delamar,
Ney.; a magnificent mass of moss gold on quartz from the ‘‘Miner’s Dream’’ mine,
Old Chester district, California; characteristic samples of Alaskan gold; fine speci-
mens of molybdenite from Okanogan County, Wash.; axinite from Switzerland and
Japan; beautiful crystals of tourmaline from Mesa Grande, Cal.; and zeolites from
Golden, Colo. Following are the new species obtained: Narsarsukite, percylite, yttro-
cerite, picroallumogene, bornite (in crystals), espistolite, plumboferrite, ankylite,
sulvanite, thalenite, elpidite, and lossenite. Fine specimens of tourmaline and ame-
thyst were received as a gift from Dr. L. T. Chamberlain, honorary custodian of gems
and precious stones.

The meteorite collection was increased during the year to the extent of 29 falls,
and now comprises specimens representing a total of 356 distinct falls. The most
valuable addition was a stony iron meteorite from Admire, Kans. The sources of
other important specimens were as follows: Misshof, Courland, Russia; Rafriiti,
Switzerland; Cereseti, Piedmont, Italy; St. Mesmin, Salles, and Lacon, France; Sao
Juliao de Moreira, Portugal; Limerick, Ireland; Shalka, Bengal, India; Rhine Villa,
South Australia; Weston, Conn.; Algoma, Wis.; Monroe, N. C.; Tombigbee, <Ala.;
Tonganoxie and Kiowa County, Rane: ; and San Aneel and iendail County, Tex

In invertebrate paleontology there were several very large and important addi-
tions. Some 15,000 specimens, including 10,000 brachiopods, 4,200 bryozoans, many
cretaceous forms from New Jersey, and cystids and crinoids from Maryland, com-
posing the private collection of Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant curator of strati-
graphic paleontology, were donated by him to the Museum. Prof. George M. Perdew
also presented his entire collection of Silurian and Devonian fossils, about 1,300 speci-
mens, from Cumberland, Md. The IE. O. Ulrich collection of Ostracoda, containing
about 5,000 specimens, and the type and figured specimens of 100 species, was
acquired by purchase. The transmissions from the Geological Survey included
3,709 specimens of Cambrian brachiopods, which had been the subject of special
study by the Director, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

The extensive series of teeth of the elephant and mastodon, obtained by Mr.
W. H. Holmes at Afton, Ind. T., associated with prehistoric implements, has proved
of great interest, several species being represented.

The accessions in Paleobotany include a valuable collection of fossil plants, com-
prising the type specimens described by Prof. Ebenezer Emmons in his American
Geology, part 6, 1857; 100 specimens from the auriferous gravels of California, col-
fected by Mr. C. D. Voy; 40 specimens from what may be the Upper Jurassic for-
mation in the vicinity of the Corwin coal mine, near Cape Lisbourne, Alaska; about
300 specimens frem the Miocene Lake beds of the South Fork of John Day River, in
Grant County, Oreg., transmitted by the Geological Survey; and about 100 speci-
mens of Upper Carboniferous plants from the vicinity of Plympton, Mo., described
by Mr. Dayid White in the Fossil Flora of the Coal Measures of Missouri, and pre-
sented by Dr. John H. Britts, of Plympton.

Explorations. —Owing to the very limited means ayailable for field researches, the
amount of work of this character carried on by assistants of the Museum has been
relatively small, and most of the expeditions made were only rendered possible
through cooperation with other bureaus of the Goyernment or through the gener-
osity of individuals. The Government explorations by which the Museum is most
benefited are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Insti-
REPORT OF THE ‘SECRETARY. 35

tution. Officers of the Army and Navy, with the exceptional opportunities now
afforded them, have also been doing some excellent work for the Museum, especially
in the Philippine Islands. In this connection mention should likewise be made of
the important explorations which Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, has been ecar-
rying on for several years in the East Indies entirely at his own expense, the results
being generously donated to this Institution. The latter comprise large collections
in zoology and ethnology, whose value is enhanced by the fact of their coming from
a region hitherto scarcely represented in any museum in the world. The field work
engaged in Guring the year by members of the Museum staff was as follows:

Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator of anthropology, visited Indian Territory and
Missouri, in the former investigating an interesting deposit of flint implements and
bone utensils associated with the remains of extinct and recent mammals at Afton,
and an ancient chert quarry on the Peoria Indian Reservation, and in the latter
examining near Kimmswick an extensive deposit of fossil mammals in which human
remains were said to occur, and an ancient village site containing stone implements
and pottery. The investigations begun by Dr. Walter Hough in Arizona, in June,
1901, were continued through the summer, in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates, of
Pasadena, Cal., and chiefly at the expense of the latter. An archeological section
was made on a north and south line from Fort Apache to Moki, a distance of about
180 miles, and a large amount of material was obtained. Ethnographical work
was also done among the Apache, Navajo, and Hopi Indians, and two new groups of
ruins north of Holbrook were mapped.

Mr. W. H. Ashmead, who accompanied an expedition of the United States Fish
Commission to the Hawaiian Islands in May, 1901, for the purpose of making col-
lections of insects and of studying the insect fauna of these new possessions, returned
late in the summer with an important lot of material. Mr. B. 8. Bowdish, formerly
of the United States Army in Porto Rico, was employed for about seven months in
procuring zoological specimens, chiefly birds, in Porto Rico, in eastern Cuba, and on
Mona Island. Mr. C. L. Pollard and Mr. William Palmer accompanied Dr. Edward
Palmer, of the Department of Agriculture, in the spring of 1902 on an expedition to
eastern Cuba, where they obtained an interesting collection of plants, birds, bats,
insects, and marine invertebrates. .

The station of the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, on the south coast of New-
foundland, was visited during the summer of 1901 by Dr. Frederick W. True, who
made a special study of the sulphur-bottom whales, obtained many photographs, and
arranged for the preparation and shipment to Washington of the skeleton of a large
whale. In a collecting trip to Colorado, Dr. H. G. Dyar, in company with Mr.
A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, secured some 10,000 specimens of
Lepidoptera, and Mr. E. A. Schwarz made in Arizona, at his own expense, a very
large collection of insects. Two months, during the spring of 1902, were spent in
southern Illinois by Mr. Robert Ridgway, in the interest of the Division of Birds.
Botanical explorations were carried on in Central America during the summer of
1901 by Mr. J. N. Rose, assisted by Mr. Robert Hay, of Washington.

Important collections were made by Mr. Charles Schuchert of Helderbergian
fossils in New York and of Cretaceous fossils in New Jersey. Mr. F. W. Crosby
obtained for the Museum a remarkably fine series of pot holes from the basalt rocks
near Snake River Falls, Idaho.

Evxchanges.—The use of its duplicate specimens in effecting exchanges with other
scientific establishments and with individuals was recognized by the act founding
the Institution asan important means of increasing the collections of the Smithsonian
Museum, and so it has proved to be during the more than fifty years that the prac-
tice has been followed. The amount of material involved in each transaction ranges
from one or a few specimens to collections of considerable size, while the equivalent
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

obtained generally consists of species or objects not previously represented. The
duplicate specimens have therefore a high value as a purchasing medium, and have
been, as a whole, the principal resource of the Museum for filling gaps in the collee
tions, and for completing its series along many lines. Much valuable material was
secured through this means during the past year from both domestic and foreign
sources, the institutions and individuals abroad entering into exchange relations
having been as follows:

Great Britain: The British Museum of Natural History at London, the Royal
Botanic Gardens at Kew, Mr. E. Lovett, of Croydon; Prof. A. C. Haddon, of Cam-
bridge; Messrs. Sowerby and Fulton, of Kew; Mr. H. Sidebottom, of West Stock-
port, Cheshire, and the Rey. F. W. Galpin, of Harlow. France: The Museum of
Natural History at Paris; Mr. Georges Lachenand, of Limoges; Prof. Michel Gan-
doger, of Arnas (Rhone); Mr. Réné Martin, of Le Blane (Indre), and Prof. 8. E.
Lassimonne, of Moulins, Allier. Germany: The Senckenbergisches Museum at
Frankfort-on-Main; Dr. J. Thiele, Mr. L. Frobenius, and Mr. C. Schirmer, of Berlin;
Dr. Edward Rosenstock, of Gotha, Thuringen, and Dr. E. Schellwien, of Konigs-
berg. Austria: The Imperial Royal Natural History Museum at Vienna. Italy:
The Royal Zoological Museum at Florence; Prof. M. Bezzi, of Sondrio; Dr. Felippo
Sylvestri, of Bevagna, Umbria, and Mr. Luigi Gardinale, of Vicenza. Switzerland:

tugal: Prof. Paul Choffat, of Lisbon. Holland: The Rijks Museum of Natural
History at Leiden and Mr. M. Buysman, of Middleburg. Belgium: Mr. Victor
Mahillon, of Brussels. Sweden: The Zoological Institute of the University of
Upsala, and. Mr. Sven Ekman, of Upsala. Japan: The Imperial University at Tokyo.
India: The Royal Botanical Garden at Seebpore, near Calcutta. South Africa: The
Albany Museum at Grahamstown, and the Botan cal Gardens at Berea, Durban.
Brazil: The Museu Paulista, SA€0 Paulo. Chile: The National School of Mines.
Uruguay: Senor Serveriano de Olea, of Montevideo. Mexico: The National Museum
at the City of Mexico. Jamaica: Jamaica Botanical Gardens at Kingston. Canada:
The Geological Survey of Canada at Ottawa, and Mr. James Fowler, of Kingston.

The exhibition halls—The crowded state of most of the exhibition halls has pre-
vented extensive additions to the display collections except in a few directions.
Much work was done, however, toward improving the condition and appearance of
these collections by small additions, and by the substitution in many instances of
better material and of a higher class of preparations. Considerable progress was also
made toward completing the system of labeling. It had been anticipated that pro-
vision would have to be made during the year for housing the Museum exhibit at
the Pan-American Exposition. A large part of the material was, however, sent to
the South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, but before the close of
the year the entire collection was back in Washington. The objects returned directly
from Buffalo have been mainly cared for by the transfer to storage of some of the
less desirable preparations previously displayed, and by utilizing, though only tem-
porarily, a part of the lecture hall. :

In the Department of Anthropology several of the halls have been thoroughly
renoyated, in some the collections have been reinstalled, and space has been found
for a few new ethnological groups.

Among the additions in the Department of Biology were many finely mounted
specimens of American mammals and birds, a part of the display at the Pan-Amer-
ican Exposition, the former including a large specimen of Steller’s sea-lion and a
skeleton of the Kadiak bear. In the south-east Museum range, allotted to reptiles,
batrachians, and fishes, some improvements have been made, several new cases being
provided, Many new preparations replacing older ones, and a number of large forms
not previously represented being added. Among the latter were a cast of the King
Cobra snake with accessories representing the edge of an Indian jungle, a very large

ite
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

Amazon River turtle, a Mata-mata turtle, a huge alligator snapper, the largest of the
North American water turtles, séveral boas, lizards, toads, and frogs. An exhibit of
lizards will be arranged in some of the wall cases.

The permanent installation of insects in the hall recently assigned to this group at
the western end of the Smithsonian building has progressed to the extent of mount-
ing about 2,700 specimens in 20 of the standard boxes occupying several upright
cases. In the labeling of this series attention has especially been called to species of
peculiar habits and to those of most interest to the public.

To the display of vertebrate fossils have been added partial skeletons of the large
Triceratops prorsus and of the carnivorous dinosaur, Al/osaurus. The installation of
the Harris collection of invertebrate fossils, in a section of the rail case of the gallery
in the southeast court, has been practically completed. This collection, received in
1898, is one of the finest yet made in the region it represents, being especially rich in
crinoids, star-fishes, and trilobites, containing of the last group about 600 out of the
750 species known from the Cincinnati formation.

The collections relating to physical and chemical geology have, in part, been
thoroughly overhauled and rearranged, and about 100 photographs, maps, and other
pictures illustrative of these subjects have been placed on the adjoining walls. The
building of galleries in the south-west range made it necessary to remove for a time
the collection of minerals, which, at the close of the year, was being reinstalled after
careful renovation.

Publications. —The publications issued during the year comprised volume 23 of the
Proceedings, and a number of papers belonging to volume 24, Part [ of Bulletin No.
50, Bulletin No. 51, two additional parts of Bulletin No. 39, and Circular No. 51,
descriptive of the collections illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, recently
prepared for distribution to educational establishments. While the annual report
for 1900 in complete form was not received from the Government Printing Office
until after the close of the fiscal year, a small edition of the several papers composing
it was distributed as separates at an earlier date.

3ulletin No. 50, entitled ‘* The Birds of North and Middle America,’? by Mr. Rob-
ert Ridgway, is intended to contain descriptions of all the species and subspecies of
birds known to oceur on the North American continent, and will consist of several
parts or volumes. Part 1 treats of the Fringilhde; part 2, covering the Tanagridie,
Icteridie, Coerebidee, and the Mniotiltidee, is in press. Bulletin No. 51, compiled
by Mr. R. I. Geare, is a list of the publications of the National Museum from
1875 to 1900, including all papers printed in the Reports and Proceedings, and has an
index by titles. The additions to Bulletin No. 39 are, a revised edition of Mr. Ger-
ritt S. Miller’s ‘‘ Directions for collecting and preserving study specimens of small
mammials,’? with abstracts in German, French, and Spanish, and ‘‘ Directions for
collectors of American basketry,’? by Prof. O. T. Mason.

LTibrary.—The additions to the library during the year numbered 615 books, 13,065
pamphlets, and 5,885 parts of periodicals.

Expositions.—At the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo, N. Y., from May 1
to November 1, 1901, the Museum, in conjunction with the parent institution and its
other branches, made an extensive and exceedingly creditable display. The main
features consisted of a large number of life-sized lay-figure groups illustrating the

.type tribes of American aborigines, of finely mounted specimens of many of the larger
American mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, and of the skeletons and restorations
of several of the large fossil vertebrates of the western United States.

Upon the close of this exposition, in accordance with the directions of the, Presi-
dent of the United States, a carefully selected collection from the above exhibit was
transferred to the South Carolina Interstate and West Indian Exposition, which
opened at Charleston on December 1, 1901, and continued until May 31, 1902.
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

For the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, to be held at St. Louis, Mo., during the
summer of 1904, Congress has appropriated $450,000 toward the erection of a Gov-
ernment building and $800,000 for the preparation and installation of an exhibit by
the several departments and bureaus of the Government. Dr. Frederick W. True,
head curator of biology, has been designated to represent the Institution and Museum
on the government board of management, having served jn the same capacity in
connection with the Pan-American and Charleston expositions.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE, BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

~ Sir: I have the honor to report on the operations conducted in the Bureau of
American Ethnology during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, under authority of
the act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating to the
American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,’’ approved
March 4, 1901. The work was carried forward in accordance with the formal plan
of operations submitted on May 20, 1801, and approved by the Secretary on May
23, 1901.

Field operations were conducted in Alaska, Arizona, British Columbia, California,
Colorado, Chihuahua (Mexico), Greenland, Indian Territory, Iowa, Maine, Missouri,
New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Porto Rico, Texas, and Wyoming. The
office work covered material gathered from most of the States and Territories, as well
as from yarious other parts of the American hemisphere.

ScoPE oF THE WorK.

The researches of the year were conducted in accordance with an ethnie system
set forth in the earlier reports. This system may be defined as the Science of Eth-
nology in its modern aspects. Although based on investigations in all parts of the
world during the past century, the system is essentially the product of the researches
in American ethnology during the last two decades of the nineteenth century. Now
that the system has assumed definite form, it affords a foundation not only for future
researches, but for applying the principles of ethnology to practical questions.
Accordingly the work of the year was gradually turned toward lines bearing directly
on questions of public interest.

Among the lines of work in what may be called Applied Ethnology, to which spe: ial
attention has been given during the year, two may be particularly mentioned:

1. Physical ethnology.—On the institution of the Bureau in 1879 the Director found
the science incomplete in that it dealt largely with merely casual chara teristics of
tribes and races, and neglected the essential characteristics expressed in the activities,
or the doings, of peoples. So, special attention was given to the habitual doings of
the several tribes studied, and at the outset each was regarded as an activital type or
genus; these were then compared, and in the light of the comparison the activities
themselves were analyzed and afterward grouped systematically. It was in this way
that the science of demonomy, with its subdivisions exch relating to a group of
activities, was developed. Now this great science, dealing as it does with the doings
of tribes and races, each regarded as a typical group, is practi ally confined to the
artificial or psychical side of mankind; it barely touches the natural or physical
attributes; yet it affords a bas’s for classifying these attributes and measur:ng the
influence of the prime force of demotic activity in shaping their development. In
other words, the earlier ethnology dealt only with features and traits inherited from
prehistoric ancestry; what may be called the New Ethnology deals with those traits
and human powers by which mankind is d'stinguished from all other organisms.
The researches indicate that such traits and powers, such features and faculties, are
connected with the normal development of tribes and races, and are, indeed, the
essential factors in the growth of nations. Accordingly it would seem that the time

.

40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

is at hand for applying the principles of the New Ethnology to American aborigines
as ethnic constituents of a growing citizenship. The application requires a statistical
study of physical characteristics, including viability, mdustrial aptitude, etc., of
typical Indian tribes, together with a similar study of mixed bloods, or mestizos,
both conducted with a view of comparison with Caucasian and other ethnic norms.
The importance of this line of inquiry is suggested by the fact that there are no
physical statistics on record of any tribe of our passing race available for comparing
stature, strength, endurance, viability, fecundity, and other physical attributes, with
those of Caucasians, either with the view of gratifying our instinctive desire for
knowledge or with the object of deriving useful information from the experience of
other peoples. The importance of inquiries concerning mestizos is sufficiently indi-
cated by the history of a neighboring Republic, whose president is at once a product
of the blended blood of the white and red races, and one of the foremost among the
world’s national leaders. Singularly, there are no trustworthy records of mestizos in
this country, though their number must reach some 380 to 60 per cent of that of the
pure-blood Indian population. Nor is it to be forgotten that many of the practical
problems connected with immigration, Chinese exclusion, the occupation of Porto
Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines, and the education of the colored race can be
finally solved only in the light of ethnologic principles, whether these be developed
through slow experience or derived from scientific researches already advanced to
the applicable stage. These and other weighty considerations have led to the
inauguration of researches in physical ethnology. During the fiscal year a series of
physical records made by Dr. Franz Boas among the Siouan Indians, with photo-
graphs representing the physical types, was accepted for publication.

2. Aboriginal economics.—It is well known that aboriginal America gave the world
corn, the potato, certain beans and squashes, tobacco, two varieties of cotton, and the
domestic turkey; it is not so well known that the native tribes utilized various other
natural resources which might well be introduced into the dietary and commerce of
Caucasian peoples; and still less is it realized that various prepared foods in hahjtual
use by the Amerinds are of unsurpassed excellence—for while succotash and hominy
have come into general use, the far superior pinole, tamale, and pemmican are only
locally used by whites and many other desirable dishes are entirely neglected.
When the Bureau was instituted it was a common impression that the aborigines
were mere huntsmen and fishermen, whose habits were in the highest degree vicious
and improvident; but as the human activities were defined and the aboriginal indus-
tries were adopted it became more and more evident that many of the tribes were
essentially agricultural, and that all subsisted in much larger degree than commonly

supposed on the produce of the soil. As researches progressed the importance of
various aboriginal food sourees neglected by the Anglo-Saxon became clear, and at
the same time it became clear that our people might learn much from the red man con-
cerning the simpler agricultural methods and the ways of bringing plants and animals
under cultivation and domestication. The success of the native in utilizing natural
resources is well illustrated in the arid region comprising that portion of the country still
unsettled. The traveler over the principal railway from afew miles west of El Paso to
a few miles east of San Bernardino traverses a zone supporting a Caucasian popula-
tion of some 20,000, with perhaps half as many Indians; the same zone abounds in
ruins of aboriginal dwellings, temples, acequias, and reservoirs, attesting a popula-
tion fully ten times greater during the agricultural period antedating the Apache
wars of the last eight or ten centuries. It is highly significant that our least-
populated arid districts in the Southwest are those yielding most abundant evidences
of numerous population during prehistoric times. A specific example may be found
in Arivaca Valley, Arizona, with a present pepulation of less than 100; yet one of
seven prehistoric villages within the valley comprises ruins of more than 120 dwell-
ings, with temple, corral, stadium, and plazas, evidently representing a population
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 4]

of fully 600 for the village and 3,000 to 5,000 for the valley. Although the depopula-
tion began in the prehistoric‘age, through wars still in progress at the time of discov-
ery, the historic period has witnessed a part of the change; for it can not be doubted
that Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, ‘Alarcon, and their followers saw within the zone
between western Texas and eastern California a population twice or thrice the
ageregate now subsisting within it, and this despite modern multiplication of indus-
tries connected with mining, grazing, and transportation. The success of the abo-
riginal husbandman in this region was partly due to a system of irrigation so
satisfactory that modern farmers often profit by the prehistoric ditches; yet his chief
advantages grew out of a more economical adjustment between labor and produce,
including crops now neglected. Among the neglected crop plants are various cacti
(locally known as saguaro, pitahaya, nopal, saguesa, ete.), whose fruits sufficed to
support the entire native population for some two months of each year, though they
are hever used by Anglo-Saxon settlers. These cacti are products of the desert par
excellence, adjusted to their habitat during geologic ages, and, in some way not yet
made out, deriving their vital energy chiefly from light; and they give promise that
(unless exterminated by vandalism) they will some day yield to intelligent cultiva-
tion and add an invaluable resource to our arid districts. The researches concerning
aboriginal food sources have been coupled with other studies in native economics,
including those pertaining to textiles used for clothing, birch bark used for canoes
and habitations, the making of baskets, ete. In most cases the immediate aim was
to record the primitive customs and crafts asa contribution to knowledge of a passing
race, but the investigations have reached the stage of yielding useful lessons to the
superior race. As announced in recent reports, productive studies of the beginning
of agriculture and zooculture have been conducted. During the past fiscal year a
memoir on Wild Rice, by Dr. Jenks, has been published, with a view of directing
attention to a natural resource giving promise of value to modern agriculture; Dr.
Russell spent the greater part of the year in a critical study of a typical tribe of the
arid region (the Pima Indians), and has prepared a memoir on their industries for
early publication; a systematic investigation of the bireh-bark industries of the
aborigines was taken up by Dr. Jenks; and Dr. Fewkes devoted a part of the year to
a special study of the aboriginal economy of Porto Rico, with particular reference te
the artifacts and customs still extant, and giving promise of future value to that
newly acquired territory.

xcept for the diversion of a portion of the energies of a few collaborators to the
applications of ethnology, the work has been continued along former lines; and, as
heretofore, most of the collaborators have been employed partly in the field and
partly in the office.

The organization of the work, which is slightly modified by the applications herein
set forth, may be defined as follows: (1) Physical characteristics (including the
demography of the native tribes), or somatology; (2) mental characteristics, or
psychology; (3) arts (including games, sports, ete.), or esthetology; (4) industries
(including economics), or technology; (5) laws, or sociology; (6) languages, or
philology; and (7) myths (together with attendant ceremonies and other obsery-
ances), or sophiology. Customary attention has been given also to general and
classific work, to the illustration, editing, and publication of reports, to distribution
of the published material, and to the ancillary office work.

Fietp RrskARCH AND EXPLORATION.

The Director spent over three months in Maine, engaged (so far as impaired health
permitted) in researches among the northeastern Algonquian Indians and in revising
his classificatory writings designed for the guidance of operations in the Bureau.
The linguistic and other material obtained from the Indians was utilized directly in

.
492 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the more general work, including the linguistic classification described in other
paragraphs.

Although occupied chiefly in adminstrative work, the Ethnologist in Charge made
a reconnaisance in eastern-central Colorado early in the fiscal year, visiting certain
archeologic localities, notably in the vicinity of Pueblo, Colo., and tracing the con-
ditions affecting tribal movements during prehistoric times about the borderland
between the peoples of the plains and those of the mountains and plateaus.

On August 16, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes proceeded to southern Colorado and northern
New Mexico for the purpose of extending archzeologic explorations in districts hith-
erto inadequately studied. His operations were extended southeastward through
New Mexico into western Texas and northern Chihuahua (Mexico); in the latter
State he made the most critical study thus far attempted of the extensive prehistoric
ruins known as Las Casas Grandes. Throughout, he made extended notes on the
surviving tribes, as well as on the various types of ruins and other relics, of which a
carefully selected collection was brought in on his return to the office on November 20.

On April 28 Dr. Fewkes sailed for Porto Rico, with the object of making such a
reconnaissance of this and neighboring islands as might serve to throw light on those
aboriginal industries still surviving and giving promise of utility, and at the same
time form a basis for a more extended investigation during the current year.
Although scarcely extended beyond Porto Rico, his work was successful, yielding
material for a special report. He returned to Washington and began the prepara-
tion of this report just before the close of the fiscal year.

Mr. James Mooney proceeded, on September 17, to the field in Oklahoma and
Indian Territory, where he resumed a special investigation of the heraldic systems
employed among the Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, and Cheyenne tribes. His work con-
tinued throughout the fiscal year, yielding the greater part of the material required
for an exhaustive monograph on one of the most interesting customs of the Ameri-
can aborigines. In connection with the study of the devices, a considerable objec-
tive collection was brought together for preservation in the National Museum.

Throughout the entire fiscal year Dr. Frank Russell was in the field, chiefly in
Arizona, though his operations extended into New Mexico and Colorado, and about
the close of the year into the Muskwaki habitat in Iowa. During the earlier
months he made an extended archzeologie reconnaissance of the upper Gila Valley,
pushing his journey southward to the international boundary, westward to the
area already covered by other collaborators, and northward to the border of the
plateau country; thence the surveys were extended over the plateaus into Colorado
and New Mexico for the purpose of comparing the lowland antiquities with those of
the highlands. During winter and spring he located in the Pima country, near Saca-
ton, and began a systematic study of the industrial and other customs of the Pima
tribe. The work yielded material for a special report on the technology of the tribe
and for a more general monograph on the historic and prehistoric inhabitants of the
Gila Valley. ;

On October 30 Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet repaired to Indian Territory for the purpose
of completing his Peoria vocabulary and grammar, and making cognate researches
among the few survivors of the Peoria tribe. He was able to perfect his records of
the language of the tribe during the ensuing month and bring his work to a success-
ful close about the middle of December.

The beginning of the year found Dr. John R. Swanton engaged in researches
concerning the language and social organization of the Haida Indians in British
Columbia. This work continued until September, yielding voluminous material for
publication in future reports. On September 30 he returned to Washington and
began preparing the material for printing.

Under the immediate guidance of Dr. Franz Boas, philologist, Mr. H. H. St. Clair,
2d, spent the first three months of the year in linguistic researches in Wyoming
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

and Oregon. In the former State hé made a full record of the local Shoshoni dialect,
and in the latter he made’a partial collection of the lexic and grammatic material of
the Wasko and Piute languages. Under similar guidance, Mr. William Jones made a
critical study of the Muskwaki language in Iowa and Indian Territory; and Dr.
Roland B. Dixon recorded the languages of the Maidu and other tribes of north-
eastern California under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History,
but with an arrangement (noted elsewhere) by which the material is available in
the Bureau work.

On September 25 Prof. W. TH. Holmes, of the National Museum, and Mr. De Lancey
Gill, of the Bureau, repaired, under the auspices of the Bureau, to northeastern
Indian Territory for the purpose of examining a spring reported by a correspondent
to contain abundant bone and flint implements associated with bones of both
modern and extinct animals. They were successful in obtaining (1) the finest collec-
tion of mammoth teeth thus far made in America; (2) one of the finest collections
of mastodon teeth ever made, and (3) the most striking collection of chipped arrow
points, lance heads, and knives thus far made ina single locality in this country.
They verified the reported association and were able to identify the spot as an
aboriginal shrine to which the attention of the aborigines was probably directed by
the gigantic teeth and bones of extinct animals, and at which sacrifices were made
through several generations. During the same trip they visited Kimmswick, Mo.,
where also human relics are reported to occur in association with bones of extinct
animals. Toward the close of the year Professor Holmes again visited this locality,
and, with the assistance of Mr. Gerard Fowke, made a considerable collection for
preservation in the Museum.

In November Dr. Robert Stein returned from a two years’ absence in Ellesmere-
land and northern Greenland, where, under facilities afforded by the Bureau, he
obtained ethnologic data of interest relating to the northern Eskimo, or ‘‘Arctic
Highlanders.’’ Besides a small objective collection designed for preservation in the
Museum, he brought in the words and musie of several songs which serve to estab-
lish the existence of an archaic language among these people, and at the same time
to demonstrate for the first time, and despite a prevailing opinion to the contrary,
the existence of a fiducial cult among them.

Under a special arrangement, Miss Alice C. Fletcher visited Oklahoma early in
the fiscal year for the purpose of verifying and extending her records of certain
Pawnee rituals designed for publication by the Bureau. Later she employed certain
aged Pawnee Indians to recite the ancient rituals in such manner as to permit the
making of phonographic and other records. Her efforts have resulted in unique
contributions to knowledge of the esoteric customs connected with human sacrifice
and other rites in pre-Columbian times and still surviving in emblematic form. <A
part of the material has been incorporated in a monograph on the Hako ritual, form-
ing part of the Twenty-second Annual Report. Also under a special arrangement,
Dr. Willis E. Everette sent in useful records concerning the Athapascan tribes of
Alaska.

During the earlier part of the year Mr. O. P. Phillips was emploved temporarily
in making motion pictures representing the industries, amusements, and ceremonies
of the Pueblo and other tribes in New Mexico and Arizona. The object of the work
was to obtain absolutely trustworthy records of aboriginal activities for the use of
future students as well as for the verification of current notes on fiducial dances and
other ceremonies. Despite accidents to the apparatus, the work was fairly success-
ful, yielding about a dozen kinetoscope ribbons in addition to about a hundred
excellent photographs made by Mr. Phillips in connection with the motion pictures.
The apparatus was kindly furnished in the interests of science by the Armat Moving
Picture Company, of Washington.

Orrick RESEARCH.
WORK IN SOMATOLOGY.

During the later months of the year definite steps were taken toward systematic
record and investigation of the physical characteristics of the aborigines. A nucleus
was already available in the form of an extended anthropometric record made by
Dr. Franz Boas among the Siouan Indians several years ago and acquired by the
Bureau in 1899; and it was decided to prepare the matter for early publication, partly
asa record of the physical characteristics of a typical group, partly as a model for
future work. In order to enhance the value of the publication it was arranged to
have Dr. Boas prepare an introduction treating of somatology in general terms and
to have Mr. De Lancey Gill, the illustrator of the Bureau, prepare suitable illustrative
material from the photographic negatives preserved in the office. The memoir is
well advanced, but was not quite completed at the close of the year.

For some years past photography has been employed in the Bureau in such a
manner as to yield useful anthropometric data. Thus, in dealing with the wilder
tribes, who would resist ordinary physical measurements on fiducial or other grounds,
the collaborators haye made it a point to obtain group photographs with the figures
so placed as to permit measurement of stature and other physical elements in terms
of a known unit figure introduced for the purpose; and, similarly, visiting Indians
photographed in the Bureau laboratory haye usually been so placed with respect to
backgrounds and other objects as ‘to permit physical measurements of sufficient
accuracy for practical purposes. During the past year special attention has been
given to photographing individuals in exact portrait, profile, and full face, with the
view of permitting the extension of measurement to the facial angle, form of cranium,
and other anthropometric elements. This was done not only in the office, but to
some extent in the field, especially by Dr. Frank Russell, who made a large number
of profile and full-face photographs of Pima Indians. Although the system is not
yet perfected, it gives promise of excellent results as the reasearches in somatology
progress.

Various collaborators of the Bureau haye collected crania and other somatic
material in connection with their field operations. For some years the material was
preserved in the United States Army Medical Museum, but it has now been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum, where the current collections of the
collaborators are now regularly sent. In the absence of specialists in somatology
in the Bureau, portions of the somatic material have been placed during the last year
or two in the hands of experts not connected with either Bureau or Museum, for
special investigation; and it is a pleasure to acknowledge the service rendered to the
Bureau in this way by Dr. George A. Dorsey, of Field Columbian Museum, and
Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, of the American Museum of Natural History. A provisional
arrangement has been made for haying such work done within the Bureau hereafter.

WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY.

For some years past the Director has given special attention to the mental charac-
teristics of the aborigines; and during recent months he has formulated a working
system of psychology adapted to the needs of ethnologic students. In part, the
results are embodied in a series of synthetic outlines of ethnologie science designed
for incorporation in successive reports and printed in somewhat abbreviated prelim-
inary form ina leading journal (the American Anthropologist) for the purpose of
eliciting suggestions from contemporary ethnologists in this and other countries.
An abstract of the principles underlying this series, designed for incorporation in
the present report, was printed in December, 1901, under the title ‘Classification of
the sciences.’”’

In addition to his duties as Ethnologist in Charge, Mr. W J MeGee continued the
application of the principles of psychology to the current researches. Two methods
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

of psychologic inquiry have been successfully pursued in the past. While these are
in some degree antithetic, they also measurably represent stages in the development
of knowledge. The first method may be defined as that of introspection; the second
as that of experiment. During the past decade the latter has attained great vogue,
and departments of experimental psychology have been built up in several universi-
ties and colleges. The two methods, more especially the latter, afford a foundation
for a third method, which is alone available for the study of large groups, such as
races, nations, or entire peoples, It may be defined as the method of direct observation
of normal interactions. In pursuing this method it is assumed, on the basis of experi-
mental psychology, that physical acts are correlated with mental actions—in other
words, that human thought and human action are interdependent. The recognition
of this simple principle removes the need for a large part of the detail work involved
in experimental psychology, forit permits the interpretation of mental characteristics
of individuals and groups from their habitual or normal actions rather than from a
repetition of special actions in a prearranged series. For this reason it has not hith-
erto been deemed necessary to introduce psychometric work in connection with the
ethnologic researches, the observations on Indian habits and artifacts seeming to afford
a satisfactory index to and measure of the aboriginal mind. In its general aspect
the principle may be said to have been established early in the history of the Bureau
through observations on activital coincidences, which have since been formulated
in the comprehensive law of the Responsivity of Mind; so generalized, the prin-
ciple may be regarded as the keynote of ethnic science, the Rosetta stone whereby
the characters of all races may be interpreted. The recognition of the  princi-
ple serves also to explain and establish the sequence of stages in human develop-
ment inferred from observations on many peoples (i. e., from savagery, through
barbarism and civilization, up to enlightenment), since it shows that each transition
was the product of cumulative experiences, long assimilated and applied through
commonplace habits rather than through abstract reflection—for in all the lower
stages of human progress the mind borrows from the hand. Customarily the stages
of culture are defined on the basis of social organization, but they may be defined
nearly as conveniently in terms of psychic development. So defined, primordial
savagery is not merely the stage in which the law rests on maternal kinship, but that
of instinctive imitation, in which experience is perceptive rather than apperceptive,
while knowledge increases through accident rather than design. Similarly, barba-
rism is not only the stage of paternal kinship and patriarchy, but that of awakening
apperception accompanied by distrust and dread of nature, in which knowledge is
stimulated by notions of divination, with accompanying physical tests slowly assimi-
lated in conscious experience. In like manner civilization is not simply the stage of
law based on territorial right, but that of habitual discovery, in which new-found
facts are consciously perceived and utilized. So, also, enlightenment means more
than mere recognition of individual rights as the basis of law; for it is the stage of
invention and of the union of individuals for conquest over nature through the exer-
cise of definite prevision based on accumulated experience. Defined in a word,
respectively, the four psychic stages are those of (1) imitation, (2) divination, (3)
discovery, and (4) invention. Now, among the applications of the principle of
the interdependence of thought and action, none are more important than those
pertaining to the developmental stages; for the leading problems of the world to-day
are connected with the lifting of lower races and more primitive cultures to
the planes of civilization and enlightenment. The special applications are innu-
merable, but they cluster about the general facts (1) that in primitive culture
thought is engendered by action, (2) that in higher culture thought leads action
and (3) that hence the most effective ways of raising lower peoples are those
of manual rather than mental training. All systematic observations indicate that

Y
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the earlier stages the mental clings to the manual so closely that the primitive
artisan feels the implement asa part of himself and commonly believes that a part
of his personality goes out into both tool and product; thus his craft isa constant
stimulus to mental activity and prepares him for further steps in the long way lead-
ing from the plane of fettering instinct to that of free invention. When the savage
or barbarian is so far educated that his hand intuitively moves knife or saw or plane
by pushing outward instead of pulling inward, his mind is in the third quarter of
the normal course of development; but to this position he can be raised only by the
oft-repeated example and simple precept of rational training applied to lower races.
The researches along these lines are not complete; some of the results were incor-
porated in a brief paper on ‘‘ Primitive numbers,’’ published in the Nineteenth
Annual Report; and a preliminary account of certain results was issued during the
year under the title ‘‘Germe d’une Industrie de la Pierre en Amerique.”’

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

Although Mr. Mooney remained in the field throughout the greater part of the
year, his researches were such as to yield material for a prospective report on Indian
heraldry. His investigations during several years past have shown that various
Indian tribes possess heraldic systems analogous in many ways to those of medieval
Europe, and that such a system is especially developed in the Kiowa tribe; and his
work during the year was carried forward in this and neighboring tribes. The ways
in which the system is developed render the study extremely difficult. The principal
heraldic devices are closely akin to totems, and are of two types, one pertaining to
tipis and the other to shields. The tipis, with their devices, belong to families or
clans in which they are hereditary. The shields, with their emblematic (or armorial)
bearings, belong to typical aboriginal groups or brotherhoods, which arise in con-
nection with the bearings themselves. Usually the devices are ‘‘dreamed’’ by a
shaman (or, as he conceives it, revealed to him ina vision), the dream indicating
also the number of shields that it is permissible to make with the particular bearing
of the revelation. In due time the shields are made in accordance with the sha-
man’s dream, and these are adopted by unattached warriors as special devices or
crests until all are in use. Each shield usually bears two devices, one on an outer
covering of skin placed over the shield proper, which may .be regarded as a
symbol of the bearing within, and the other or real device on the face of the shield
beneath the cover. The latter is never revealed save in sacred ceremony and in
battle, when it is displayed as a magical device for offense, as well as defense, against
enemies. Each of the shields is eventually regarded by its bearer, or keeper, as the
symbol of his special tutelary and a sort of receptacle for his personal spirit of
warfare. It is prized and kept sacred during his lifetime (the purpose of the
cover being to protect the sacred device from sacrilegious gaze), and, unless sacrificed
in his declining days on the death of a kinsman, is buried with his body—he enters
on the dark under-world path of his faith with his head pillowed on the device
which mysteriously carried him safely through many dangers in all the days of his
life. By reason of the habitual sacrifice of shields and the decline of aboriginal cus-
toms, few now remain, though fortunately many others are preserved in memory
and tradition. Moreover, the devices can be adequately studied only with the aid
of their respective keepers and bearers who can be induced to reveal the magic, or
““medicine,’’ of the devices, or—still better—to reconstruct them in such manner as
to permit the investigator to trace the interrelated meanings of the various features
as they are slowly wrought in accordance with archaic ritual. The family tipis have
also become rare, though nearly every family has surviving representatives acquainted
with the family crests and with the ritualistic and other modes of constructing both
tipis and heraldic devices. Mr. Mooney’s method has been to employ survivors of
both brotherhoods and families to reconstruct their shields and tipis, respectively,

with all the armorial bearings of. the olden time, the objects to be preserved in the
National Museum after the study is finished. Naturally the task has been a tedious
one; yet the progress has been ‘satisfactory. The heraldic systems of the native
tribes are of much interest in that they open the way to knowledge of various obscure
customs of primitive peoples and also to vital stages in cultural progress. Thus, the
devices represent a peculiar development of totemism; they are closely related with
the calendric systems found among the tribes of the plains; and through these they
are akin to the glyphic systems employed in the aboriginal books and sculptures of
Mexico and Central America. Moreover, since they represent the transition from
prescriptorial to secriptorial culture, they are found to throw much light on the gene-
sis of those European systems of heraldry whose origin is lost in the darkness of the
prehistoric. Finally, the heraldry of those tribes in which it is best developed forms
a nucleus for the esthetic activities generally; in them artistic shapement and color-
ing find their highest expression; in connection with them the powers of imagina-
tion and the inspiration of fiducial symbolism attain their highest perfection, and
through them ritual and faith and the intensely dramatic ceremonial warfare were
crystallized and kept alive. To the lowly aborigines they were more than the text
and picture and drama of higher culture. The greater part of the material for a
monograph on the subject was brought together during the year.

Ethnologists have long realized that the widest gateway to aboriginal life is that
afforded by games of chance; for primitive men, especially in that barbaric culture in
which divination is the keynote of psychic character, are habitual gamesters, and not
only deyote much time to gaming, but play openly and with such infatuation as to afford
constant opportunities to the student. The lowly games of the native Australians,
New Zealanders, and Polynesians have received much attention; those of Korea,
Japan, and China, in which the barbaric element of divination is supplemented by
skill, have been described by eminent authors; the games of the American aborig-
ines have been studied not only by collaborators of the Bureau, but by other able
ethnologists, notably Tylor; and the various studies afford a foundation for systematic
research. The work was taken up incidentally by the late Frank Hamilton Cush-
ing, with the collaboration of Dr. Stewart Culin, of Philadelphia, author of notable
treatises on Korean and other games. The joint study was incomplete at the time
of Mr. Cushing’s death; subsequently it was carried forward independently by Dr.
Culin. During the year an arrangement was effected with Dr. Culin under which
he has nearly completed a monograph on Amerind games for publication by the
Bureau. In the prosecution of the work he has made several field trips, has exam-
ined material in all the leading museums of the country, and has prepared numer-
ous photographic and other illustrations. The results of the study are of much
interest in that they illustrate a curious commingling of the fiducial and fortuitous in
the notions of primitive gamesters. Actually the games are played as of chance
rather than skill (though considerable skill is eventually developed); yet the play-
ing is essentially devotional toward the mysterious potencies held to control the
physical world and govern human affairs. Accordingly the games played for pas-
time run curiously into the most sacred ceremonies, and the devices employed afford
a fruitful revelation of primitive thought. By reason of the wealth of material, the
monograph has become voluminous. It was not quite ready for delivery at the end
of the year, but is promised for the first quarter of the current year.

During the year Prof. W. H. Holmes, now of the United States National Museum,
completed the monograph on aboriginal pottery of Eastern United States, of which
he prepared the first draft while an officer of the Bureau. Although primarily tech-
nologic, it forms an important addition to knowledge of aboriginal esthetics. As
repeatedly noted in the ethnologic work, esthetic motives invariably arise in sym-
bolism and develop through a conventionism shaped by ancillary or adventi-
tious conditions, including texture of materials, character of tools, ete., as well as
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

growing conceptuality and power of imagination. Now, no line of esthetic develop-
ment is more complete than that represented in the decoration of fictile ware, and
jhe author of this monograph, combining as he does thorough technical knowledge of
the potter’s craft with high artistic skill and unique esthetic feeling, has been able to
trace in masterly fashion and to illustrate effectively the growth of fictile decoration.
As a faithful description of aboriginal pottery, the treatise will undoubtedly become
a classic; yet it is no less noteworthy as the most comprehensive contribution thus
far made to the history of one of the most important activities in those stages of
culture in which the shapement and decoration of pottery have ranked high among
the ayocations of mankind. The monograph forms the body of the Twentieth
Annual Report.

During the year the series of graphic representations of personages in the Hopi
pantheon collected by Dr. Fewkes, as mentioned in previous reports, was sent to
press as a part of the Twenty-first Annual, under the title ‘‘ Hopi Katcinas.’’ Dr.
Fewkes also completed the illustrated memoir.on his unique collections of pottery
and other material from Arizona and New Mexico noted in the last report. It is
in press under the title ‘‘Two summers’ work in Pueblo ruins,’’ as a part of the
Twenty-second Annual.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

Primarily Professor Holmes’s monograph on aboriginal pottery of Eastern United
States is a description of the fictile ware classified by districts, so far as practicable
by tribes, and also by technologie types. The art of the potter is old, far older than
written history, so that its beginnings can never be traced directly. The antique
and prehistoric wares themselves yield a partial record of the development of the
art, and the archeologists of the Old World have been able to supplement and
extend the written history of pottery making through study of such material, and
their researches have lent interest to the ancient vessels and sherds with which the
museums of the world are enriched. Yet the fictile ware of Egypt and Babylonia,
Etruria and India, and other Old World provinces falls far short of telling the
whole story of the art, since it fails to reveal the actual motives and sentiments of
the early artisans—the relics are husks of the history of pottery making without the
vital kernel. Accordingly the archzeologic studies in America supplement the Euro-
pean researches in a highly useful way. In the first place, the period of pottery
making by the American aborigines was comparatively short, so that the prehistoric
and the historic are closely related; and, in the second place, the several living tribes
within reach of current observation represent various stages in the development of
the art, so that opportunities exist in America for studying the motives and senti-
ments of the artisans engaged in all of the earlier developmental stages of the art.
In general, the craft of the potter may be said to arise in the social stage of savagery
or the psychic stage of imitation, with its tedious growth through accidental improve-
ment; in general, too, the art may be said to expand and differentiate in the suc-
ceeding barbaric stage with the attendant diyinatory concepts as motives; and it is
this stage, with its protean forms, textures, decorative devices, and modes of man-
ufacture, which has been found peculiarly inscrutable by students of the products
alone. Now, it is precisely this stage which is represented by most of the American
aboriginal ware, both prehistoric and historic, and by the surviving tribes. Accord-
ingly Professor Holmes’s description of the American ware, with his critical analysis
of types and interpretation of motives, would seem to afford not merely a supple-
ment to, but a sound foundation for, the history of the potter’s art. The mono-
graph, which forms the body of the Twentieth Annual Report, embraces faithful
representations of some 250 typical specimens.

Of the two special investigations concerning aboriginal industries undertaken during
the year, that by Dr. Fewkes in Porto Rico would seem to be of the more general
interest. While his trip to the Antilles was designed as a reconnoissance of Porto
“HI ALV1d ‘TO6L ‘Hoday ueluOsUyIWS
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Rico, Haiti, and the islands immediately adjacent, he was prevented, partly by the
volcanic disturbances of early May, from extending observations beyond the first-
named island; yet this failure of plan resulted beneficially rather than otherwise,
since it enabled him to make‘a more definite ethnologic and archzeologic survey of
Porto Rico than was at first contemplated. Among the surviving types of aboriginal
handicraft to which he gave special attention were those connected with habitations.
In all parts of the American hemisphere the prevailing house type is in some measure
a composite, or blend, of the indigenous and the imported; and while in most dis-
tricts the imported motives are so far predominant that the indigenous elements are
hardly traceable, there are other districts, especially in tropical, subtropical, and arid
regions, in which the aboriginal types are of such excellence that many elements
have been retained with advantage by Caucasian settlers. This is especially true in
the Antilles, where natural conditions of climate, water, and available material have
led to light and inexpensive types of construction by which European settlers have
been glad to profit. The types are somewhat analogous to those which have been
better developed in the Orient, especially in Japan, and which are frequently com-
mended to the attention of occidental builders and householders. When it is remem-
bered that the prevailing Anglo-Saxon types are at once adapted to the rigorous
climate of northwestern Europe and adaptations of materials developed in the north-
ern temperate zone, it becomes evident that they are not well suited to our southern
temperate zone, and especially to our tropical and subtropical possessions. Then,
when it is remembered that the indigenous types, e. g., of Porto Rico, are specifically
adapted to the local climate and adaptations of local materials, it would seem clear that
architectural motives derived from them ought to be even more useful than any bor-
rowed from Japan. These considerations have influenced the researches in Porto
Rico, and they are in part the motive of the special report on Porto Rico prepared by
Dr. Fewkes. Other motives have grown out of the native food sources which have
been found useful by generations of European settlers, and out of those aboriginal
modes of food preparation which are of such excellence as still to survive. It would
appear from the observations that several native foods are worthy of attention and
cultivation by settlers from the United States, and that some of the indigenous modes
of preparing food might well receive careful study with a view to maintaining the
excellence of the preparations when more advanced modes of handling, milling, pre-
serving, and transporting are introduced. The details of Dr. Fewkes’s investigations
are incorporated in a memoir designated for early publication in the form of a bul-
letin. The industrial data are supplemented by bibliographic and other material,
which will render the report a manual of Porto Rican ethnology and archeology.
The special investigation undertaken by Dr. Russell among the Pima Indians
covered aboriginal industries developed in and adapted to the arid region. Here,
as in Porto Rico, local types of habitation have resulted from the climatic and other
local conditions. The primal house type is a small circular structure of canes or
reeds, roofed with earth, the whole supported by an inner framework of poles. This
type is differentiated according to available materials, the grass house and the house
of cactus (okatilla stems or saguaro ribs) being closely related derivative forms. It is
differentiated also by arrangement of material, as when the canes or cactus staves
are wattled with reeds or withes, and the house tends to become square in plan with
vertical walls eventually beplastered by the washing of mud from the roof and by
the throwing up of embankments as wind-breaks below. Under the imitative
instinct of savagery the wattled walls are coated with a mortar of mud, which is
magically ‘‘hardened’’ by the embedment of pebbles and larger stones; and this
may be deemed the secondary type of aboriginal architecture in southwestern United
States and northern Mexico. From it develops under favorable conditions a third
type—i. e., that of rubble masonry set in mortar of mud or even laid dry; but where
building stone is Jacking, the pebble-set wattle structure grows into a distinctive

sm 1902———4
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

architecture of which the basis is the puddled wall, or pisé, called by Spanish settlers
‘‘cajon,’’ the fourth house type of the arid region. Aboriginally, the earth used in
the structure was doubtless tamped between wattled walls, at first permanent and
afterwards temporary; certainly during later times the earth was built up in succes-
sive ledges between movable screens of wattling so placed and braced as to form a
temporary trough for each ledge. The cajon structure was durable, and was suscep-
tible of development into communal houses of many rooms and several stories. As
in the primal type, the roof remained of earth laid on shrubbery supported by a
sheathing of canes or cactus staves and rafters of cedar poles; on one-story houses it
was a place of temporary resort for the occupants, and with the gradual evolution of
parapets and the growth of these into higher stories the roofs became upper floors.
Subsequently (probably after the Caucasian invasion) earthen bricks laid in mud
mortar were substituted, and this type of construction, known as adobe, was generally
adopted; and in the better buildings, both of cajon and adobe, the walls were coated
with a thin plaster or slip fixed by some form of soda or other earthy salt. Now, the
aboriginal cajon house type is admirably adapted to the present needs of the arid
region and is well worthy of consideration by Caucasian settlers. Properly con-
structed, cajon walls are much superior to adobe in homogeneity and strength, though
somewhat more expensive in labor. Their durability is sufficiently attested by Casa
Grande in the Gila Valley, which was a ruin of immemorial antiquity when discoy-
ered by Padre Kino in 1694, and which is still standing despite vandalism as well as
natural weathering. Moreover, the cajon is readily susceptible of improvement by
the addition of lime or cement to the material in any desired quantity and by substi-
tuting a plaster of lime or cement for the simple slip. So improved, the native con-
struction would seem better adapted to the conditions and requirements of habita-
tions in the arid region than any imported models. The cost would be only that of
the lime and the handling of materials, while wood, burned brick, and even stone
are highly expensive. The thick walls would effectively equalize interior temper-
atures despite the enormous diurnal range, which is the most serious obstacle to
residence in arid districts; and the general massiveness would lend itself to distine-
tive and desirable architectural effects. Dr. Russell’s researches extended also to the
lighter and more composite types of construction surviving among the Pima and
neighboring Indians, as well as to the attendant industries and food sources. Among
the latter the fruit of the cactus figures prominently, not only 1n modern customs
but in tradition and ceremonies, attesting the still more important place which the
fruit and its products occupied in the lives of past generations. Dr. Russell’s mate-
rial has been so divided as to yield a special memoir on technology, designed for
early publication in bulletin form, and a general monograph on the social organiza-
tion, mythology, and esthetology of the Pima tribe and on the antiquities of their
habitat.

During the year Dr. Albert E. Jenks revised the proofs of his memoir on ‘‘ Wild
rice gatherers of the upper lakes,’’ forming part of the Nineteenth Annual Report.
This treatise is deemed especially valuable in that it calls attention to a widespread
food source largely used by the aborigines and giving promise of great utility to our
citizens whenever the requisite attention is given to cultivation, milling, and prepa-
ration. In food yalue the wild rice ranks high among cereals, and its natural
habitat is such that by its means otherwise useless swamp lands may be utilized and
reclaimed, while it can not be doubted that with judicious cultivation it might be
adapted to an eyer-widening range of soil conditions. Later in the year Dr. Jenks
resumed his researches concerning the birch-bark industries of our northern
aborigines. As noted in the last report, one aspect of the industries clustering about
the birch tree is of prime significance to ethnologists in that the birch-bark canoe
was the most effective agency of distribution of tribes and culture during early times;
yet it is well worth noting that the interest is a living one, since the bark canoe
remains a most effective device for transportation among white men as well as red.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5]

Indeed, its use by white, tourists, fishermen, hunters, etc., is apparently increasing in
northern United States and @anada. Various other birch-bark artifacts are in use
among whites as well as natives. The half conventional, half symbolic makok, or
maple-sugar box, proves to form a convenient household utensil; birch-bark baskets
of different forms are found useful as well as artistic; and on the whole it would
appear that the birch-bark industry is not only increasing in consequence of demands
by whites, but that it serves as a helpful stepping-stone from the primitive customs
of the Indian toward the free and self-supporting citizenship which is the Indian’s
ultimate goal. Exigencies connected with the editorial work of the oftice compelled
Dr. Jenks to divert a part of his time from the research. Accordingly, the work was
not quite completed at the end of the fiscal year, when Dr. Jenks was, at the request
of the Director of the Philippine Bureau of Nonchristian Tribes, furloughed for a
year, with a view to the more effective introduction of the methods of the Bureau of
American Ethnology in the Philippine researches.

For several years Mr. J. D. MeGuire has been engaged in investigating certain
lines of aboriginal technology, and certain of his results have been published in the
reports of the United States National Museum. During the last fiscal year he began,
at the instance of the Director, a critical study of the earliest records of aboriginal
technology made by the Conquistadores, missionaries, and other pioneers. During
the year just closed he continued the work and has made a series of extracts from
the records which have proved of great use to the Director and the collaborators
engaged in field researches. The extracts are arranged on cards, and certain install-
ments of these have been acquired for the use of the Bureau.

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY.

Throughout most of the year the time of the Ethnologist in Charge has been so
fully oceupied with administrative work, largely relating to publication of the reports,
as to somewhat delay his sociologic inquiries; yet fair progress has been made. One of
the special inquiries of the year relates to what may be called, by extension of common
terms, aboriginal land tenure, this investigation being rendered timely by current
progress in the allotment of lands in severalty to former tribesmen, as well as by recent
occupancy of territory formerly inhabited by native tribes in Alaska, Hawaii, and the
Philippines. The researches indicate that primitive peoples have no conception of
land tenure in the sense in which the terms are employed by civilized and enlightened
peoples. In the first place, there is no recognition of individual title to lands or
other natural values, for any such values are regarded as pertaining to the clan, the
gens, or the tribe, 1. e., possession is communal rather than individual. Inthe second
place, the property sense is especially inchoate as applied to lands, which are viewed
as natural ranges for men and animals, 1. e., for local tribes and local fauna; and
there is no recognition of ownership or title inimical to the natural and ccordinate
rights of other men and beasts. True, there is among most tribes a vague sense of
prescriptive right to long occupied territory, i. e., to the home of the ancients who
play so prominent a role in primitive philosophy, so that commonly a tribe feels it a
right and a filial duty to protect the home range against permanent invasion by aliens;
yet the vague right so recognized scarcely applies to the land per se, but only to the
rights of the chase, fisheries, fruits, and any cultivated products, personal habita-
tions, quarries or clay pits, etc., i. e., to what may be called the usufruct of the soil.
In other words, the attitude of the savage or barbarian toward property in land is
much like that of American citizens during the last century toward property in water,
i. e., in the rains, rivers, lakes, seas, artesian water, ordinary ground water, et al.,
during recent decades the idea of property in water has grown up in the less humid
districts and is rapidly extending, yet the development of the concept is slow, even
in the minds of the most intelligent people. Perhapsa closer parallel may be found

.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in air as viewed by enlightened peoples, for the air is regarded as essential] y com-
mon to all living and breathing things, and its use as an inherent right far tran-
scending conventional titles to personal or communal property. There are, indeed,
certain germs of communal property right in air, manifested in the occasional actions
ofneighborhoods looking totheabatement of certain nuisances, yet the claims put forth
in such actions relate rather to the free and common use—or to usufruct—of the air
than to its possession as property, so that our attitude toward air is closely analogous
to that of primitive folk toward land. The results of the inquiries find ready appli-
cation in connection with various public questions. One of the conclusions is that
primitive folk can not be at once transferred from the plane of collective interest in
the usufruct of the soil to that of individual land tenure, any more than the farmer
of the Atlantic seaboard could be brought in a day to full understanding of irrigation
water rights, with all the complications of dams, sluices, main ditches, gates, etc.—
indeed, the education of the citizen farmers who have gone West and grown up with
irrigation was much more rapid than could be expected of the slower-minded tribes-
men. Accordingly, it would clearly be a mistake to transfer tribesmen directly from
the range to the severalty holding; there should be (as indeed experience has
shown in dealing with the Indians) an intermediate period of proprietary training
on collective reservations. The researches indicate that this period should cover at
least a generation; in most cases two generations would be required for the devel-
opment of that sentiment of thrift and feeling of independence required for success-
ful citizenship. Some of the results of the year’s work have been made public in
scientific papers and addresses, and progress has been made in arranging the material
for formal issue in reports.

In connection with his linguistic researches in British Columbia, Dr. John R.
Swanton collected definite information concerning the kinship terms and other fac-
tors in the social organization of the Haida Indians, and toward the close of the year
he made progress in arranging the data for publication.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY.

During the earlier part of the fiscal year the Director continued the arrangement
of Mexican and Central American linguistic material with a view to the classification
of the aborigines of the southern portion of North America on a linguistic basis. As
during the preceding year, Dr. Cyrus Thomas collaborated in the work. The com-
pletion of the task was delayed by the illness of the Director during the later
months of the year.

At the opening of the year Prof. Franz Boas, of Columbia University, was given
an honorary appointment as philologist, and was intrusted with the supervision of
a considerable part of the linguistic researches in which the Bureau is engaged.
One of the objects of the appointment was that of obtaining a uniform series
of outlines of Indian languages to be published in synoptic form for use in
comparative studies by the philologists of the world. The work requires exten-
sive preparation because of the wide range and considerable volume of the mate-
rial both in hand and required. At the time of discovery there were in North
America somewhere between one and two thousand tribal dialects or languages
belonging to about a hundred linguistic stocks or families, so that the scope
of the work is so broad that it may not be accomplished except by the cooper-
ation of many specialists devoted to particular groups of languages. Under exist-
ing conditions it seems inexpedient to attempt covering the ground through the
Bureau alone; and the plan of the work intrusted to Dr. Boas is to enlist the
cooperation of other institutions and other linguistic specialists. During the past
year the work was organized in cooperation with the American Museum of Natural
History, Columbia University, Harvard University, and the University of California.
The collaborators included Dr. John R. Swanton, of the Bureau; Mr. H. H. St.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

Clair, 2d, of the American Museum; Mr. William Jones, on behalf of Columbia
University; Dr. Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard, and Dr. A. L. Kroeber, under the
auspices of the University ‘of California. Dr. Swanton’s work comprised the tran-
scription of a voluminous series of Haida texts; he also completed a synopsis of
the Haida language for incorporation in the general series. Mr. St. Clair devoted a
part of the year to work on a dictionary and grammar of the Chinook language,
and in addition made a critical study of Shoshone linguistic material in the archives
of the Bureau and of the American Museum. Mr. Jones made good progress in
analyzing the grammar of the Sauk and Muskwaki dialects, nearly completing a list
of suffixes and prefixes; he also made good progress in arranging for publication a
series of Muskwaki texts collected during the preceding fiscal year. Dr. Dixon
prepared a grammar and vocabulary of the Maidu language, while Dr. Kroeber
collected and arranged both lexic and grammatic material representing several
other California tribes. Partly through the inspiration of hearty approval from
scientists and scholars both at home and abroad, Dr. Boas and his collaborators
have taken up the work with zeal and enthusiasm. Dr. Boas observes: ‘‘ Linguistic
work in many parts of North America is exceedingly urgent on account of the
rapid disappearance of the native languages, and the means at our disposal for this
work are insuflicient;’’ yet it is a gratification to report that the interest of the
collaborators who have worked gratuitously or for only nominal compensation has
resulted in a large volume of invaluable material at trifling cost to the Bureau. It
is a pleasure to acknowledge the generous contributions of Dr. Boas and the other
collaborators named.

During the year Dr. Boas completed the proof revision of his memoir entitled
‘‘Kathlamet Texts,’’ and it has been published as a bulletin. He also completed
the manuscript for a similar memoir entitled ‘‘Tsimshian Text,’’ and it was trans-
mitted for publication on January 29, 1902.

Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet carried forward to substantial completion his vocabulary
and grammar of the Peoria language, and also continued the arrangement of material
for the comparative Algonquian vocabulary. In addition he devoted some time to
special researches required for answering some of the numerous requests for informa-
tion concerning Indian terms and phrases constantly received from correspondents.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt devoted the greater part of the year to his monograph on
Iroquois Creation Myths, mentioned in previous reports; three of the five sections
were sent to press during the year as a part of the Twenty-first Annual Report.
Toward the close of the year he took up the general discussion of principles noted
in another paragraph; and as a part of the current work, he continued the extrac-
tion and arrangement of Iroquoian linguistic material in a form suitable for refer-
ence and eventually for publication. Throughout the year a considerable part of
Mr. Hewitt’s time was occupied in the researches required for answering technical
inquiries from correspondents—a duty which seems unavoidable, although its per-
formance retards progress in systematic researches.

Miss Jessie E. Thomas continued the transcription of the manuscript Diccionario
de Motul, while Senor Andomaro Molina, of Merida, Yucatan, made good progress
in the translation of the Maya and Spanish terms into English, with a view to the
issue of this extensive vocabulary in a form appropriate to the publications of the
Bureau. In view of the prospective value of this work to future students, it would
seem important that the final translation should be based on thorough and critical
knowledge of the Maya, Spanish, and English languages; and in view of this desira-
bility, in connection with the fact that Sefor Molina is a volunteer collaborator resi-
dent in another country, it is deemed proper to insert the following: voluntary
expression from the United States consul at Progreso, Yucatan, Hon. Edward H.
Thompson, himself a critical student of the antiquities, history, and languages
of Yucatan: ‘‘To my mind, in the work of Lic. Andomaro Molina, the Bureau
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

has done the best work of the year and has done it in the best possible way. It
has arranged to give to light and study a much-needed work, and it has put it in
the very hands best fitted to do it. J am, perhaps, competent to speak upon this
subject, and I am willing to place on record my belief that no living man can do this
work intrusted to him so well as Mr. Molina. The work that he is doing can not
be done by a foreigner. J am, perhaps, as well informed upon the native Maya,
their habits, customs, ete., as any living foreigner, and, it may be, better than any
other. I know enough to know that I could not do the work as it should be done.
This task should only be undertaken by one who has been brought up on milk from
a native breast, whose first words were in Maya, and whose thoughts come easier to
him when clothed in the Maya form than when in classic Castillian or downright
Anglo-Saxon. Such a man is Molina. To the instincts and the education of a
scholar he adds the subtile understanding of the native and as perfect command of
the ancient language, the Maya, as any man can have at this day.”’

The final proofs of the Natick Dictionary, compiled by the late James Hammond
Trumbull, were revised during the year, and the greater part of the sheets have
been printed.

In addition to his work on the Mexican and Central American linguistic records,
in immediate collaboration with the Director, Dr. Cyrus Thomas continued his inves-
tigation of aboriginal records in the form of codices, sculptures, ete. His work was
productive, yielding among other results a memoir entitled Quirigua Calendar Sys-
tems, which was sent to press as a part of the Twenty-second Annual Report.

Progress was made also in preparing for the press the translations made by Mr.
Charles P. Bowditch of certain scattered yet noteworthy contributions to knowledge
concerning the calendric and other records of Mexico and Central America, and it is
a pleasure to acknowledge the generosity of the translator in contributing the mate-
rial and furthering the work of its preparation in every practicable way. Toward
the end of the fiscal year Mr. Elbert J. Benton was temporarily employed to edit the
material and arrange the illustrations for publication in the Twenty-fourth Annual
Report; this work was well advanced at the close of the year.

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

About the end of May Miss Alice C. Fletcher completed her monograph on the
Pawnee Indians under the title ‘‘ Hako; A Pawnee Ceremony.’’ In many respects a
typical tribe of the plains, the Pawnee Indians were in some points the most remark-
ably developed of the prairie tribes. Like other vigorous aboriginal groups, they
were composite; an important constituent (later known as the Skidi band) was from
the wooded hills and broad bottom lands of the Arkansas country, where they or
their ancestry developed a woodland culture, and doubtless performed a share in the
erection of the imposing mounds of the Lower Mississippi region; other tribal con-
stituents represented prairie provinces; and there are strong suggestions in the
rich tribal mythology that at least a cultural constituent was absorbed from the
highly religious sedentary peoples of the Southwestern pueblos. Then the com-
posite tribe lived long (as attested by their traditions as well as their customs) in the
prairie region, which they shared with the buffalo; and, in even greater degree than
the Siouan tribes farther northward, they adjusted themselves to this natural
spoil—so that the buffalo became the furnisher of their food, the source of their
raiment, the giver of material for their habitations, the guide of their migra-
tions, the goal of their handicraft and hunting tactics, and, finally, one of the fore-
most among their deified tutelaries. Accordingly the fiducial ceremonies of the
tribe combine the intensity of local veneration for a few leading tutelaries with a
wealth of imagery and ritual derived from other districts and peoples, and all
vivified by the common union and interaction. During earlier days the rituals were
so far esoteric as generally to escape the notice of ethnologists as well as casual visit-
ors; but during recent years a few students, notably Miss Fletcher, have been per-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

mitted to enter the arcana and witness the sacred ceremonies, and even to examine
and obtain interpretations of the magic ‘‘bundles’’ which serve as the tangible basis
of the rituals. All of these rituals are impressive; some, like the Hako, are of
remarkable richness, not only “in gesture and measured movement, but in the poetic
imagery expressed in word and music and pantomime. Miss Fletcher’s record
appears to be perfect, and she has analyzed with acumen the rhythm and melody
of the chants, the symbolic harmony of the accompanying pantomime, and the
meaning expressed in the intricate figures of the dance and movements of the march
forming essential features of the ceremony. From Miss Fletcher’s rendition and
interpretations it would seem that these elaborate rituals open a vista looking directly
on the beginnings of song, dance, drama, poesy—certainly they are a revelation to
students of the highest phases of human culture as well as to the investigator of
primitive customs. The memoir is in press as a part of the Twenty-second Annual
Report.

In connection with his comparative study of Indian creation myths, Mr. Hewitt
has been led to analyze certain fundamental features of primitive philosophy, espe-
cially those forming the basis of totemism, shamanism, ete. It is well known that in
the different Indian languages there are terms difficult of translation into modern

tongues which are of deep meaning to their users, e. g., manido, or manitou, among
the Algonquian tribes, wakan, or wakanda, among the Siouan tribes—terms covering
a larger proportion and wider variety of the thought of primitive men than any
single term covers in higher culture. Among the Iroquoian Indians the correspond-
ing term is orenda, which may be translated ‘‘ mysterious power for good and evil,”’
‘‘powers of magic,’’ or, more briefly, ‘‘magic potency.’’ Mr. Hewitt’s analysis was
announced in a preliminary paper, and has already proved serviceable to ethnologists
in this and other countries; and it seems probable that the Iroquois term will come

into general use in the English language for purposes of sophiologic discussion. The

complete study is designed for publication in the second part of ‘‘ Iroquois Creation
Myths,’’ which was nearly ready for the press at the end of the year.

For a number of years Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson has been investigating the
myths and ceremonies of the Zuni Indians, the progress of the work being retarded
by her ill health, as noted in previous reports. During the earlier months of the
fiscal year Mrs. Stevenson was on temporary furlough, and the state of her health so
improved as to permit her to take up the work again. Accordingly she was able to
finish the revision of several incomplete chapters and to arrange the material for the
entire monograph in form for publication. The nature and extent of the work have
been reported repeatedly; it may be noted merely that Mrs. Stevenson’s ambition
has been to make a model record of the elaborate ceremonies of one of the most
interesting of the Pueblo tribes, and that it is a source of much gratification to
announce the satisfactory completion of the work.

Although their researches were devoted primarily to other Indian activities, sev-
eral of the collaborators haye made noteworthy collections of sociologic material
during the year, the work of Dr. Fewkes on Porto Rican zemis and zemeism, that of
Mr. Mooney on the fiducial factors in Kiowa heraldy, that of Dr. Russell on the calen-
dric systems and accompanying beliefs of the Pima Indians, that of Dr. Jenks on the
mythology of birch bark, and that of Dr. Swanton on the mythologic features of
social organization among the Haida Indians being especially worthy of mention.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

In connection with his field work, Mr. Mooney was able to make some progress in
the preparation of the Cyclopedia of Native Tribes; and when other duties per-
mitted, Dr. Thomas continued the collection of material for this work, both from
current publications and from the rare books constantly being added to the library.

About the middle of the year the Hilder translation of the manuscript history of
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Texas by Padre Morfi was taken up for annotation with a view to publication. The
historical annotation was kindly undertaken by Dr. George P. Garrison, of the Uni-
versity of Texas, and the manuscript was in his hands at the close of the year.

COLLECTIONS.

All of the collaborators engaged in field operations made more or less extensive
collections for study and for ultimate transfer to the United States National Museum.
3y far the most extensive of these collections was that made by Mr. Mooney as a
means for the research in heraldry. This collection still remains in the field. Dr.
Russell collected a full series of objects representing the arts and industries of the
Pima Indians, including a series of baskets representing the more archaic as well as
the modern forms; among the unique objects comprised in the collection are two
calendric records intermediate in character between the winter counts of the North
and the maguey-book records of the South. Dr. Fewkes made considerable collec-
tions in New Mexico and Chihauhua early in the year, and subsequently obtained
an interesting series of aboriginal objects in Porto Rico. As usual, various collec-
tions were obtained also by purchase under the more immediate direction of the
Secretary.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau comprises (1) office furniture and apparatus, (2)
ethnologic manuscripts and other original records, (8) photographs and drawings
of Indian subjects, (4) collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in
research, (5) a working library, and (6) undistributed residues of the editions of
the Bureau publications. There was little change in the amount or value of office
property during the year. Purchases of office furniture were inconsiderable; several
manuscripts were acquired by purchase, mostly for immediate publication, as noted
in previous paragraphs, while the records of original work progressed steadily; about
855 negatives (glass and film), 2,050 prints, and a number of drawings were added to
the collection of illustrative material, and an approximately proportionate quantity
of illustrative material was used in the reports. Most of the collections of the year
have gone directly to the United States National Museum; some, like those of Mr.
Mooney, are still in use. The library has maintained a steady growth, chiefly
through exchanges, partly by the purchase of current ethnologic books and early
records pertaining to the aborigines. The additions of the year comprise about 895
books and 150 pamphlets, raising the contents of the library to 11,3839 books and
2,500 pamphlets. The number of back reports was reduced through the constantly
increasing public demands for ethnologic literature; nearly all of these documents
are now out of print. During the first half of the fiscal year Mr. J. Julius Lund con-
tinned in charge of the property as custodian; after Mr. Lund’s resignation Mr.
Frank M. Barnett was appointed to this position. Miss Jessie EK. Thomas remains
in immediate charge of the library and Miss Ella Leary of the distribution of
documents.

PUBLICATIONS.

At the beginning of the year Mr. Herbert 8S. Wood had charge of the editorial
work; subsequently he was furloughed for several months, when Dr. Albert E. Jenks
assumed editorial duties in connection with his researches; in June Mr. Wood
resumed his editorial capacity, and toward the end of May Mr. Elbert J. Benton was
temporarily added to the corps as editorial assistant. The second part of the Eight-
eenth Report was delivered from the bindery on January 7, and was immediately
distributed; Bulletin 26 was delivered on March 11, and, after brief holding in the
hope that the Nineteenth Report might be distributed at the same time, was sent out
to the exchanges about the end of the year; separate copies of the papers composing
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. am

the Nineteenth Report were delivered in March, but the binding of the volumes was
delayed by reason of unusual conditions in the Printing Office, and the edition was
not delivered at the end of the year. On January 29 the Twentieth Annual Report
was transmitted. It is designed for publication in one volume, and comprises, in
addition to the formal report, the Holmes monograph on aboriginal pottery. The
Twenty-first Annual Report was transmitted for printing on March 12. It, also, is
designed to form one yolume, comprising, in addition to the formal report, the
memoirs on Hopi Katcinas, by Dr. Fewkes, and Troquois Creation Myths, by Mr.
Hewitt. On June 30 the Twenty-second Annual Report was transmitted for pub-
lication in two volumes. It comprises, in addition to the administrative report, Two
Summers’ Work in Pueblo Ruins, by Dr. Fewkes, Quirigua Calendar Systems, by
Dr. Thomas, and Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony, by Miss Fletcher. On January 29 Dr.
Boas’s memoir entitled Tsimshian Texts was transmitted for publication in bulletin
form. At the close of the year material was in hand for the Twenty-third Report
and for the greater part of the Twenty-fourth.

Mr. De Lancey Gill remained in charge of the illustrative work, preparing copy
for, and revising proofs of, the illustrations for the Twentieth and later reports. He
also made photoportraits of some 200 Indians, chiefly members of delegations visiting
Washington, and developed a considerable number of negatives made by the several
collaborators in the field, and, in addition, he made a useful series of field photo-
graphs in connection with the work of Professor Holmes in Indian Territory, as
noted elsewhere. As heretofore, he was assisted by Mr. Henry Walther.

I have the honor to be, yours with respect,
W J McGerr, Acting Director.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATICNAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
International Exchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1902:

The work pertaining to exchanges is confined to the southeast basement of the
Smithsonian building. The rooms, five in number, extend along the south front for
a distance of 144 feet, and in the main were especially constructed nine years ago for
the exclusive use of the Exchange Service. Considerable space has since been added,
making the shipping room much larger, and various improvements have been intro-
duced to facilitate the handling of packages.

The equipment of the Exchange offices is especially adapted to the peculiarities of
the work, and consists, in addition to the necessary desks and their usual accessories,
of several sorting tables for folding and arranging parcels, a large number of bins (each
of which is used as the receptacle of all parcels for a single country until a sufficient
quantity shall haye accumulated to make a minimum shipment), cases for reference
books and directories, filing cases for ledger cards (upon which are recorded accounts
of all exchanges with each correspondent), and cabinets for filing receipt and index
cards and for general correspondence. Other articles of office furniture are type-
writers, scales, trucks, ete.

It is pertinent to state that most of the articles of office furniture and fixtures have
been purchased from Smithsonian funds, the Congressional appropriations having
been sufficient only for the payment of most of the salaries, a part of the transporta-
tion expenses, and the purchase of expendable supplies for packing and office use.

Since the last report of the Exchange Service, there have been no extensive addi-
tions to the general equipment of the Exchange offices except the construction of an
hydraulic elevator for raising and lowering exchanges to and from the loading plat-
form, and the placing of a scale with a weighing capacity of 2,500 pounds near the
elevator shaft. The expense incurred by both these improvements was borne by the
Institution.

During the last fiscal year there has been no loss of exchanges transmitted to the
Institution from abroad, so far as known, and but one instance in which outgoing
exchanges have been lost or even damaged. The latter occurred February 1, 1902,
when three boxes of exchanges for correspondents in South Australia were entirely
destroyed by water while a fire was being extinguished in the hold of the steamship
Bucrania, which was loading at Brooklyn, N. Y. Each contributor was notified of
the loss, as is the custom of the Institution in such eases, with the result that most
of the publications were duplicated.

The work performed by the Exchange Service during the year and the extent to
which the influence of the service is felt throughout the civilized world is shown in
its various features by the accompanying tables.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

During the year 38,647 packages were received from abroad for distribution, and
87,149 packages of domestic publications were sent to correspondents outside the
United States, making a total of 125,796. The aggregate weight of these exchanges
was 396,418 pounds, or an average of little over 3 pounds per package. It will thus
be seen, by comparison with the last report, that while the total weight of the
exchanges received and transmitted during the year 1900-1901 exceeded those of the
year following by 17,859 pounds, the number of packages handled during the latter
vear exceeded those of the preceding year by 4,736.

The number of packages received from abroad for United States Government estab-
lishments aggregated 11,290, while those sent under authority of Congress and by
United States Government departments and bureaus numbered 52,871. Eliminating

of those received from abroad for distribution in the United States during the same period.

Government establishments weighed about 65 per cent of the total of all transmissions
for the year, or about 258,000 pounds.

By comparison, the receipts from abroad are far from being a satisfactory equiva-
lent of those sent, especially with regard to governmental exchanges. This mequal-
ity is gradually being adjusted by some countries, and it is hoped that in the not
distant future the exchanges from abroad may be considerably increased. In this

connection I beg leave to suggest that were a representative of the Institution con-
stantly on the ground, deyoting his attention to the requirements, not only of our
national library, but of the various departmental libraries in the matter of exchanges,
the returns for the publications now so generously distributed by the United States
would soon be greatly increased, if not quite equalized.

Following are the total number of parcels sent and received during the year:

Shipments, 69 per cent:

Scientific and miscellaneous exchanges........-.-------------- 27, 357
: 38, 647
RO tale ALCe Sa ae Kee eens one ae eet, fore eta Samet ea et 125, 796

The number of correspondents in the United States has reached a total of 8,739,
the increase during the year having been 590. There are now 38,200 names of
libraries and individuals on the records of the Exchange Service, representing an
increase of 2,495 names during the year.

The sum appropriated by Congress for the support of the International Exchanges
during the fiscal year was $24,000, being the same as that granted for each of the two
immediately preceding years. The attention of Congress, through its committees,
was called by the Secretary to the inadequacy of the appropriation on account of the
steady increase in the work of the service, the improvement inaugurated therein by
substituting ocean express for freight as a medium of transportation, and the addi-
‘‘onal requirements that the Institution would be obliged to meet by reason of the
adoption by Congress on March 2, 1901, of a resolution requiring the Public Printer
to deliver to the Library of Congress, for its own use and for international exchange,
62 instead of 50 sets of Government publications, ‘except as such number shall be
enlarged to not exceed 100 copies by request of the Librarian of Congress.’? On this
account Congress, in its sundry civil act approved June 28, 1902, saw fit to grant an
increase of $2,000, or $26,000 in all, for the next fiscal year. :

Owing to a readjustment of the duties of the deputy collectors of the port of New
York, Mr. Charles A. King succeeded Mr. John C. Williams on February 7, 1902, as
the officer designated by the collector to enter and care for international exchanges
arriving from abroad.

Despite the constant endeavors of the Institution to establish more adequate
exchange relations with the Governments of Japan and China, all efforts in that
direction have thus far been futile. Only exchanges for governmental and native
educational institutions in Japan can be distributed under the present arrangement,
and all other contributions are therefore discouraged. In China no facilities are
provided for the official distribution of exchanges, and the Institution has no means
of distributing parcels in the Empire except those bearing addresses in Shanghai,
which are delivered by the courtesy of the Zi-ka-we. Observatory.

Thus far Great Britain, Germany, and Austria-Hungary have not adopted the
custom prevailing elsewhere in Europe of officially providing for an international
exchange of publications, and the Smithsonian Institution, with the aid of funds
provided for the support of the Exchange Service, has been obliged to maintain
salaried agents in each of these countries and to bear the expense of distribution of
parcels as well as for transporting the publications of those countries to the United
States. It is hoped, however, that the steps that have been taken from time to time
to adjust this inequality in the exchange system may eventually be successful.

The Institution hag been especially fortunate in the selection ot its agents in those
countries where no provision has been made officially for conducting exchanges.
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. Felix Fligel, Messrs. William Wesley & Son, and Dr. Joseph von Korésy,
located at Leipzig, London, and Budapest, respectively, have faithfully served the
Institution for many years. Dr. Fligel has given constant attention to the service
for nearly half a century, while the Messrs. Wesiey have acted as the agents of the
Institution since 1862.

ce, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Governmental exchanges for Quebec, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Mexico
are not retained at the Institution until an entire box has accumulated, but are
promptly dispatched by registered mail as soon as received.

During the year several depositories have been added and reserve sets have been
contributed, as follows:

The Commonwealth of Australia, the seat of which is temporarily at Melbourne,
was added in December, 1901, and on the 19th of that month 68 boxes were shipped
in care of the attorney-general of the Commonwealth.

On September 4, 1901, a shipment was made to the National Library of Ireland at
Dublin, consisting of 81 boxes, and the same number was forwarded to the Legisla-
tive Library at Quebec on July 26, 1901.

The Legislative Library of Manitoba at Winnipeg was placed on the list of deposi-
tories January 16, 1902, but only selections have thus far been provided. It is
expected, however, that a more liberal contribution will be made when the addi-
tional copies provided under the joint resolution of March 2, 1901, are received from
the Public Printer.

Respectfully submitted.

Besides these animals about 50 gray squirrels were purchased during the year and
set at liberty in the park.

The cost for purchase, collection, and transportation of these accessions has been
$3,500. Besides this there has been spent for books, photographs, apparatus, and
office furniture the sum of $1,900.

The appropriation for the general service of the park was made in the following
terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage
and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the grounds;

73
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and
transportation of animals; including salaries or compensation of all necessary
employees; the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, the printing and pub-
lishing of operations, not exceeding one thousand five hundred copies, and general
incidental expenses not otherwise provided for, eighty thousand dollars; one-half of
which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other
half from the Treasury of the United States; and of the sum hereby appropriated
five thousand dollars shall be used for continuing the entrance into the Zoological
Park from Cathedral avenue and opening driveway into Zoological Park, including
necessary grading and remoyal of earth. (Sundry civil act March 3; 1901. )

Besides the regular cost of maintenance, the following alterations and additions to
the buildings and grounds have been defrayed from this appropriation during the
year:

The flying cage.—This large cage, begun during the last year, has now been com-
pleted and fitted with rockwork, planted with aquatic and other plants, and sup-
plied with running water and pools. About 50 birds are at present in the cage and
it is hoped to increase the number considerably next season. The cage forms a very
attractive feature of the park. The expenditure from this year’s appropriation in
connection with it is about $5,000.

Addition to temporary bird house.—There being no suitable place for parrots, of
which the collection included a considerable number, a room for them was added
to the temporary bird house and divided into five large compartments. Several birds
were put in each cage and they have much improved in health and attractiveness
since this disposition of them was made. This addition cost $700.

Repairing elephant shed.—Attention has before been called to the dilapidated con-
dition of the structure. It had become so open about the sides that it could not be
made warm enough for the animal in cold weather. In the autumn of 1901 a layer
of heavy building felt was put on the sides and this was covered with siding, at a cost
of $250

An appropriation of $20,000 was asked for a new house for elephants and other
pachyderms, and at the close of the year $10,000 was appropriated for that purpose.
This will provide for only a small house, the construction of which will be at once
commenced.

Cages for polar and Kodiak bear.—Two large yards for these bears were begun about
the close of the year. Each will be about 40 feet square, with secure and comfortable
house and a large bathing pool attached. The cages will cost, complete, about $1,800.

Cage for eagles.—Shortly before the close of the year a cage for eagles was begun,
50 feet by 27 feet and 35 feet high. It will contain a pool, a mass of rock, and a large
tree on which the birds may perch. The cost will be $1,000.

Carnivora house.—The ‘arge floor tank for alligators having become decayed and
leaky, a new tank was built of concrete. A large case was also constructed in this
building for boas and pythons. This installation is not suitable for either the alliga-
tors or the snakes, and the space which they occupy is needed for other purposes.

Fountain.—At the Secretary’s suggestion a fountain was constructed in front of the

carnivora house, at a cost of $350.

Driveway from Cathedral avenue.—A portion of the fill of earth required was made
from the appropriation for the previous year; fill was completed and roadway 18 feet
wide built, with telford base and top dressing of crushed stone. A small amount of
work was also done at the ford on this road. Total cost $5,000, the amount of the
special appropriation.

Adams Mill road.—By reason of its very steep grade, this road is difficult to main-
tain. It became necessary to reshape the steep portion; the macadam was thoroughly
loosened, the crown of the road remade, adding considerable new material, and the
road finished with a new surface dressing of crushed limestone.

Connecticut avenue entrance.—The roadway on Joliet street between Connecticut
avenue and the park entrance was completed by the District on permanent lines, and

making it necessary to change the line of the roadway in the park for a distance of
about 300 feet. rat

A walk of crushed stone was constructed at the Adams Mill road entrance to con-
nect with the new concrete walk laid by the District in April of this year. Con-
siderable work was done on other walks and a footbridge was erected to afford
convenient access from the east bank of the creek, near the upper ford, to the west
bank and the paddocks near by.

Planting was carried on throughout the year. A sereen of shrubs and small trees
was set about the shop building and many shrubs and vines were planted around the
office building as a screen and for ornament.

Observations on flying birds. —The park, though full of interest for the publie, is not
a place of recreation only, for though one of its primary objects is the instruction
and recreation of the people, another

indeed, the very first of all prescribed by
Congress—is the advancement of science, and for this latter we must look to experi-
ments in the future for which we have not means to-day. In pursuance of a purely
scientific problem, the park has recently procured optical apparatus for determining
the interesting problem of the flight of the soaring bird by photographing the great
buzzard (Cathartes aura) simultaneously from two adjacent temporary wooden towers
which have been erected.

The following are the more important accessions to the collection during the year:

Gijfts.—Dr. FF. W. Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New South Wales,
shipped several lots of animals by sailing vessels to San Francisco (thus securing free
transportation). Most of the animals died during the long voyage. A fine specimen
of dingo, however, arrived in good condition, and a fine gray kangaroo and brush-
tailed opossum were received shortly after the close of the year. Dr. Goding is
exceptionally well placed for getting animals, takes active interest, and expects to
get valuable specimens. He has been asked to forward future consignments by
steamer to shorten the time of voyage.

3y EK. H. Plumacher, United States consul at Maracaibo, a considerable consign-
ment of animals was forwarded, but several died en route. A monkey and a fine
specimen of two-toed sloth were received in good order. Other animals are to be
sent soon.

From Perry M. De Leon, United States consul-general at Guyaquil, Kenador, a fine
lot of animals was received, including parrots, a toucan, three monkeys, and several
smaller animals. He also forwarded two consignments by sailing vessel, but these
died en route.

From Solomon Berliner, United States consul at Teneriffe, two lanzarotte pigeons
and two choughs.

From J. H. Starin, New York, six harbor seals.

From Oscar J. Craig, president University of Montana, a very fine beaver.

From Stephen Gheen, Tower, Minn., a pair of Canada lynx.

From August Busck, United States Department of Agriculture, five Cuban boas.

In connection with animals presented by Consul Plumacher, I wish to acknowl-
edge the courtesy of Messrs. Boulton, Bliss & Dallet, of New York, in furnishing
free transportation for animals on their Red D Line of steamships from Maracaibo to
New York.

From Capt. John L. Young, proprietor of Young’s pier, Atlantie City, N. J., a
considerable number of fish were obtained for the aquarium. Captain Young also
kindly assisted the agent sent by the park to procure specimens.

Yellowstone National Park.—¥ rom this source there were received during the year
four antelope, five mule deer, five elk, two cinnamon bears, one grizzly bear.

The acting superintendent of the Yellowstone National Park sent word that there
was opportunity to capture a grizzly. A steel cage-trap was accordingly constructed
in the shops of the National Zoological Park and shipped to the Yellowstone. <A
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fine specimen was captured in this trap and forwarded to Washington, reaching its
destination in good order.

Exchanges.—Several exchanges were effected during the year. Among the ani-
mals obtained were the following: From the New York Zoological Park, a very fine
male axis deer; from the Zoological Society of London, a young female yak; from
Thomas W. Gibson, of the department of crown lands, Ontario, Canada, eight black
squirrels; from William Bartels, New York, a female Barbary sheep and a female
polar bear.

Births.—The number of births during the year has been quite satisfactory. It is
gratifying to note that two beavers were born during the present season.

Purchases.—Under your instructions very special efforts have been made in the
last three or four years to procure a Kodiak bear. The animal is by no means
exterminated, but has fled to uninhabited, difficult regions, where it can not be
obtained except by the expenditure of an inordinate sum of money, whereas it was
formerly procurable in relative abundance. A young male was, however, procured
during the present year through the cooperation of the Alaska Commercial Com-
pany. It was captured on the mainland directly opposite Kodiak Island, and is
believed to be the true Ursus middendorffii. Efforts are being made to get more
through the same agency. Considerable rewards for additional specimens have been
offered throughout that region and are still advertised, though so far without results.

After years of effort two bighorn or Rocky Mountain sheep have been procured
from western Colorado, one within the present year. It is desirable to explain that
the Institution’s extreme difficulty in procuring this animal, not at all an unfamiliar
one to hunters, arises from the fact that the Institution proceeds scrupulously within
the law, which requires a permit from the authorities of the State in each case.
This is charily given, in some cases apparently through the opposition of game war-
dens, who seem to have no sympathy with the Institution’s aims. These permits,
while only obtained with great difficulty, are given for a brief time and to a single
individual. The wholesystem is apparently designed with a proper purpose to throw
obstacles in the way of procuring game by unfit persons. It actually operates to
almost absolutely prevent its procurement by the General Government through insti-
tutions or persons who are the fit recipients of the game, and as scrupulous in their
desire to obey the State laws as the Smithsonian Institution isin its capacity as guar-
dian of the Government interests in the National Zoological Park. Further than
this, or indeed as a consequence of the practical refusal of permission under the law,
the final effect is that nearly the only animals which are obtainable are those for
sale by persons who have taken them in defiance of the law.

Other purchases were a male moose and a pair of Columbian black-tailed deer
from the International Forest, Fish, and Game Association, two female pumas from
northwestern Wyoming, two young California condors, a female South American
tapir (as a mate for the male already in the collection), three red kangaroos, and a
carabao, or Indian buffalo, from the Philippine Islands (under recent regulations of
the Department of Agriculture, to prevent the introduction of ‘‘surra,’’ such animals
can not now be imported). A stock of birds was obtained for the flying cage, includ-
ing a pair of adjutants, six European storks, an ibis, and other birds.

One of the bears procured in Alaska for the park in the summer of 1900, being now
old enough for its identity to be determined, is found to be the Yakutat bear, Ursus
dalli.

Losses of animals. —Two old bull bisons; death probably due to old age; diagnosis
gastroenteritis. One California sea-lion, from pneumonia. A male and female
moose, from gastroenteritis; received November, 1899, died December, 1901, and
March, 1902; in good health until summer of 1901. Great difficulty is still experi-
enced in the care of these great forest animals. Three pronghorn antelopes, includ-
ing a buck that had been in the park five and a half years. One young elk, killed by
an old bull.

—__ ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (er

From the effects of intestinal parasites: Three Newfoundland caribou, a litter of arctic
foxes, one adult fox, and one “ule deer. A number of other mule and other deer
were affected. These parasités were probably introduced and distributed by prowl-
ing dogs. In order to extirpate them, the mule deer were treated and removed to
another paddock; their former paddock was then disinfected by burning over the
surface of the ground with a surface heater such as is used in repairing asphalt
pavements.

Boundary fence.—In making up the estimates for the appropriations for the next
year, as for the past several years, the imperative need of a fence was again urged upon
Congress. No special appropriation was made, however, but it was understood that
the increase in the regular appropriation might be devoted to this purpose if the
Secretary saw fit.

Attention has been called in previous reports to the fact that no adequate provision
for housing small tropical mammals exists inthe park. At present these animals are
confined in small cages, which are sometimes placed on the top of others, thus injur-
ing the appearance of the collection. The animals are also deprived of adequate
exercise. Their mortality is therefore unnecessarily great. The park receives every
year a considerable number of such animals, particularly from the new possessions of
the United States, and is very much embarrassed to find room for them. For those
at present at hand, not considering any future additions, there is required a space of
140 linear feet of cages. It is recommended that Congress be asked to appropriate a
sufficient sum to build a suitable house for tropical mammals where they can be kept
in better health and comfort than they are now able to enjoy.

No department of the park attracts more popular interest than the aquarium, and
its educational value is certainly very great. The present installation of this collec-
tion of salt-water and fresh-water species in a mere temporary shed is, however,
entirely inadequate to its needs that I would urge the construction of a suitable build-
ing fitted with permanent tanks, heating and refrigerating apparatus, and open pools.

In accordance with the Secretary’s wish to see a larger development given to the
salt-water fauna, a concrete tank, covered with a glass roof, was built for the storage
of sea water, and the north side of the building will be devoted to this part of the
exhibition. A new filter has been provided, and other minor improvements have
been made.

Another important need is a reptile house where the great tortoises, crocodiles,
alligators, boas, pythons, anacondas and other reptiles belonging to the collection can
be exhibited, and where other specimens obtained from time to time can be housed.
These reptiles are now placed in the same house with the lions, tigers, and other cats.

The park very much needs an aviary for small terrestial birds. The present bird
house 1s almost entirely occupied .by struthious and aquatic birds, the song birds
being wholly unrepresented. In connection with such an aviary there should be
built a flying-cage of moderate size, with a tunnel of cage work through which the
public can walk, surrounded by singing birds flitting about in every direction.

The collection of wolves and foxes has hitherto been kept in a series of temporary
pens near the principal animal house. These inclosures are far from satisfactory, as
they soon become dilapidated and permit the animals to dig out or break through.
New and permanent quarters for these animals should be erected in some suitable
part of the park.

sO

The sea-lions and seals now in the park are not provided with proper quarters.
As the turbidity of the water in the large pool seriously injured them they have
recently been confined in cages built for the bears near the Quarry Road entrance.
They have here only very small basins of water and are not able to swim about at
all. Houses and a pond of filtered water should be provided for them.

The attendance of visitors at the park has been steadily increasing. At present the
average daily number of visitors is larger than ever before, and on several occasions
30,000 persons have been in the park in a single day. This increase in attendance
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

further emphasizes the need for more efficient restaurant facilities. At present there
is no suitable restaurant, only an open pavilion where candy, cakes, and light bever-
ages are sold. As the park is at a considerable distance from the city, the absence of
a properly equipped restaurant is a great inconvenience to those wishing to spend the
day in it, particularly if they are accompanied by children. The erection of a public-
comfort building especially equipped for ladies and children, and with a restaurant
attached, is therefore very desirable.

It would be much more satisfactory as well as less expensive if sufficient appro-
priations could be made to provide permanent buiidings as rapidly as they are
required by the public needs and the growth of the collection. At present a con-
siderable part of the appropriation has to be spent each year in repairing temporary
structures. The park has now been in operation long enough to safely determine
where permanent improvements should be placed.

The principal object for which the park was originally instituted was the preserva-
tion of our national game, especially that which is becoming extinct. This has
been represented to Congress, but as yet no special provision has been made for it.
According to your recommendation an appropriation will again be asked for collect-
ing and preserving some of the great land and marine specimens of our western
territory now rapidly disappearing. Experience has abundantly proved that such
wild creatures, unaccustomed as they are to the sight of man, can not properly be
transported immediately after capture, as they are likely to seriously injure them-
selves or even to die of fright if some means are not taken to gentle them or accus-
tom them to being handled. I can therefore entirely agree to the value of the
method you have proposed of establishing some small station or stations in Alaska
where there are yet found specimens of the Kodiak bear, the great moose, the wal-
rus, the fur seal, and possibly other large creatures. They could there be confined
and kept amidst familiar scenes and be fed upon their natural food while becoming
more accustomed to the sight of man and more tractable. The expenditure for such
stations would be slight. é

I have already mentioned that after years of effort the park has at last procured
one Kodiak bear cub. Bears as a rule do not breed freely in captivity, but it is most
desirable to try the experiment, under such favorable conditions as the park may
afford, and I hope that more animals of this species may be obtained.

I close with a list of the animals of the park on June 30, 1902, and with a reitera-
tion of the statement that the park is nevertheless not filling its principal function
until it can maintain and preserve for posterity the most important specimens of the
great vanishing fauna of this country, and particularly of Alaska.

(b) Library and records.—The library has been enlarged by the addition of periodi-
cals and books of reference at an expenditure of $200. Books and periodicals have
been bound at an expenditure of $250. Total for library, $450.

The observatory inclosure, shown in Plates VI, VII, has been enlarged by the addi-
tion of 10 feet along its northern end so as to be now 155 by 77 and to include nearly
12,000 square feet, as against 11,000 square feet formerly. The photographic building
has been removed from a position west to a position north of the siderostat, and the
buildings and fence have been repainted. These alterations and repairs have been
made at an expenditure of 5400.

No losses of property have occurred.

THe WorK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience, the work of the Observatory will be described under the follow-
ing headings:

1. Publications and miscellaneous work.

2. Progress of investigations.

(1) Publications and miscellaneous work.

In accordance with a resolution of the Senate of the United States,“ a report was
submitted by you at the meeting of Congress in December, showing the appropria-
tions expended, results reached, and present condition of the work of the Astro-
physical Observatory. This report consisted of a brief statement of the foundation,
aims, results, and present condition of the Observatory; a copy of Volume I of its
Annals; a preliminary report of its eclipse expedition of 1900; and several state-
ments? by eminent foreign and domestic men of science, giving their views of the

@Senate resolution of February 25, 1901.

> As indicating the nature of these statements, I here give extracts from two of them:

“‘T can not deny myself the pleasure of congratulating you on the accomplishment
of this vast and important labor. When I think of what it must all have been, I am
lost in admiration at the work.’’—Sir G. G. Sroxes.

“To anyone who is conversant with the astronomical work done in recent years it
seems wholly unnecessary to testify to the immense value of the work done at the

merits of the Observatory and its works. This report was referred in the Senate to
the Committee on the Library and ordered to be printed with all its inclosures. It
therefore became necessary to supply some new copies of illustrations for the
engravers, and opportunity was offered to correct a number of errors discovered in
Volume I of the Annals, so that this new edition, forming a part of Senate Document
No. 20, is considerably improved. The preparation of the first drafts for the report,
the preparation of new illustrations, and the reading of proofs naturally occupied con-
siderable time of the Observatory staff. Several hundred copies of this edition of
the Annals were secured for the Observatory, and thus it will be possible to supply
a limited number to those who may from time to time make request for them.

Of the numerous inquiries addressed to the Institution by correspondents all over
this country and the world, many relating to astronomy, physics, and chemistry are
referred to this Observatory for answer, and thus an amount of time by no means
trifling is spent on work of no immediate concern to the Observatory researches.
However, the search for the information asked for so frequently leads to obtaining
knowledge of value in our own work, that it is on the whole, perhaps, time well
spent, independent of considerations of the convenience of the TInstitution’s
correspondents.

(2) Progress of investigations.

The solar radiation; its total amount and its absorption.—Y ou showed long since that
ordinary actinometry, or measures confined to the investigations of white light, can
never furnish trustworthy data in relation to the output of the sun, since the
absorption of our air is so different for different wave lengths that it is only by going
further and examining the spectrum in detail that satisfactory results are obtain-
able. This kind of energy spectrum work has been taken up very extensively here
in the past year.

The solar energy spectrum.—The early work of this Observatory described in Volume

1 of its Annals was chiefly concerned with the minute absorption bands in the infra-
red solar spectrum. As all readers of the Annals are aware, automatic prismatic
energy curves were made by the aid of the bolographie process, and such inflections
of these curves as were found not accidental in their origin corresponded to the
so-called Fraunhofer lines of the visible spectrum. Less attention was paid to the
whole height of these curves at their various parts than to these numerous small
variations in height. Still, a chapter of the Annals was devoted to the inferences
relating to the absorption of our atmosphere which could be drawn from the data
relating to secular variations in the general form of the curves then available. But
since the curves were taken at a slow speed to allow full time for recording the
small inflections, the total heights were less comparable, owing to possible changes
in the transparency of the air, the altitude of the sun, and the behavior of the appa-
ratus which might intervene between start and close of a curve.

NEW WORK.

The absorption of the atmosphere and of the solar envelope.—This present year care has
been taken to obtain energy curves whose heights shall be comparable. It was the
purpose of this work to study the general absorption of the sun’s envelope, the gen-
eral absorption of the earth’s atmosphere, and the changes in the selective absorp-
tion of water vapor in the latter. It is the further object toward which these studies

Astrophysical Observatory under your superintendence. The bolometer, which
science owes to your inventive resource, is one of the boldest and most original
instruments ever devised for scientific research. It permits the exploration of a field
which is entirely closed to any other means of investigation. The many results
which you have obtained with this instrament are deemed by all astronomers of the
very highest importance in the study of those parts of the spectrum concerning
which we should otherwise have remained in ignorance.’’—Sir Roperr 8. Bau.

tend to see if the sun is constant or variable in its output of radiation. While the
results of the past year indicate possibility of considerable ultimate success in this
final object, it may probably prove that the situation of this Observatory is unsuita-
ble to the most exact studies of this kind, owing to the great and variable absorp-
tion of the air column above it, as well, of course, as to the ground tremors inherent
in its present site, surrounded by the traffic of city streets. It seems certain, how-
ever, that valuable contributions to the methods of study to be adopted in work at
more favorably situated stations, and to the knowledge of terrestrial absorption, can
be made here.

Alterations of the apparatus.—For the sake of accuracy in the height of the curves,
the speed of taking energy curves has been much increased. Thus we now custom-
arily adopt the speed ratios 2 centimeters of plate and 20 minutes of are of spectrum
in 1 minute of time, while the ratio 1 em.= 1’ = 1m. was the standard one adopted
for the detailed study of the infra-red spectrum. At the present speed the spectrum
between wave lengths 0.45 sc in the blue and 2.5 yc in the infra-red is passed over in
fifteen minutes. Such a spectrum energy curve is shown in Plate VIII. At this
fast speed much less opportunity offers for ‘‘drift,’’ alteration of sensitiveness of the
galvanometer, and, what is far more common, for clouds or haze to diminish the
accuracy of the work. In order to keep the behavior of the apparatus as constant
as possible and to get the best possible detail at this rapid speed, the great glass prism
has been employed instead of rock salt, thus limiting the research to wave lengths
less than 3. But this includes nearly all the solar radiation which reaches the sea
level. To avoid extra reflecting and absorbing surfaces as far as practicable, a single
mirror is used for collimation of the spectroscope in place of the two employed for-
merly when great detail was sought, and the bolometer case is used open at the end,
although a shght amount of accidental disturbance of the record is involved on
windy days. In the interest of the greatest detail practicable at the fast speed, it
was most desirable to shorten the time of swing of the galvanometer. A new gal-
vanometer of most approved design has been constructed and has been in use since
December, at an average time of single swing of 1.5 seconds. This type of galva-
nometer is in some respects, I think, new and worth a brief description, which will be
found on a later page. To avoid errors from differences of diffraction from the edges
of the slit, the slit width has been maintained unaltered at 0.25 mm., subtending
10.5 seconds of are in the spectrum. Its height, 5 centimeters, has been virtually
reduced to 2 centimeters in the infra-red portion of the spectrum by the expedient
of interposing across it at the proper time a brass grill-shaped diaphragm, which,
being fixed upon pivot bearings on the slit mounting, always occupies the same
place when interposed before the slit. The factor of this diaphragm can be meas-
ured by the aid of data found on each curve, but the results are constant within the
limits of measurement. Bolometer No. 20, of 0.08 millimeter width and subtend-
ing 10 seconds of arc, has been used for the entire year. This bolometer has been in use
nearly all the time since if was made in 1896, and always with great freedom from
drift and other disturbance. Soon after my return from Sumatra I suggested, and
you caused to be constructed at the Observatory shop, a more improved type of
mechanical rheostat for the bolometer, which has been used since with great satis-
faction. Drift of the galvanometer spot now rarely reaches 4 centimeters in a day,
and it is rarely in excess of 2 millimeters upon an energy curve taken in fifteen
minutes. So firm is confidence in the behavior of the bolometer that the unshunted
galvanometer is left in connection with the circuit weeks at a time. No rebalancing
of the circuit is required for a month at a time. One can now prepare for bolo-
graphic work one day and the next merely start the siderostat and the driving clock
with practical certainty of securing a good bolograph.

The absorption of the apparatus.—In order to know the true distribution of the
radiations throughout the spectrum, it has been necessary to determine the absorp-
tion of the spectroscope. As mirror surfaces deteriorate, this has to be done not
88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

infrequently. The procedure adopted has given the absolute loss by reflection at
the siderostat mirror for all wave lengths, and the relative loss for the several wave
lengths in the remainder of the apparatus. Without here detailing the procedure at
great length, it is sufficient to say that the operation consists of two parts. First a
second spectroscope is set up whose spectrum is formed at the slit of the first. Here
the bolometer is placed and its indications read for several points in the spectrum.
The bolometer is then replaced at its usual stand and energy curves of the small
portions of spectrum it has just been measuring are taken. These bits of spectrum,
it will beseen, have suffered absorption in the main spectroscope since the corre-
sponding deflections were first taken in the first spectrum at the slit. Therefore the
several quotients of the areas under the bits of energy curve to the deflections
obtained prior to absorption are in proportion to the transmission of the spectroscope
at the several wave lengths.

In the second part of the procedure two freshly silvered mirrors are placed parallel
to each other in such a way that the beam of the siderostat mirror strikes the first,
is reflected to the second, and thence to the spectroscope. This causes the spectrum
to be weaker at all wave lengths by loss experienced from two reflections than when
obtained with the beam from the siderostat mirror direct. Thus is the absorption of
the two mirrors determined, and by replacing the siderostat mirror temporarily by
one of them, its absorption follows at once. These determinations of the absorption
of the apparatus have been made several times, but I will not here give their results
more in detail, which are in general accordance with those already reached by you.

Absorption of the atmosphere and selective absorption of water vapor.—Since January 20
all favorable opportunities have been used to take quick speed energy curves. These
have been made with quite different altitudes of the sun. Sometimes as many as 15
have been taken in one day, and 160 were secured between January 20 and July 1.
These curves are studied from two points of view, first, as regards the variation in
height for single wave lengths with different altitudes of the sun; second, as regards
the variation in area and especially the areas of the great regions of water-vapor
absorption. The first kind of examination leads to the determination of the general
absorption of the air, the second to fixing the variations in amount of the solar radia-
tion and of the special selective absorption of water vapor.

To illustrate the first method of study, let us suppose several energy curves to have
been taken in a single clear day, during which the barometer height was (B), and
let (B,) be the standard barometric height, generally taken as 76 em. From the
altitudes of the sun as computed from the hour angles and declination, the air mass
(m) is determined. This quantity represents the ratio which the mass of air traversed
by the solar beam bears to that mass of air which would be traversed if the sun was
directly overhead. If we suppose (e) to represent the amount of radiant energy per
square centimeter of a certain wave length which reaches the earth’s surface, and
(¢,) the amount prior to absorption by the earth’s atmosphere, and let (a) be the
proportion transmitted per unit air mass, then by the well-known formula of
Bouguer: 4

B
e=e,a ao

But since the height (d) of the bolographic energy curve at the wave length in
question is proportional to (e), we may write:

B
d=ke=ke,a'"B,

“As you have pointed out, this formula is grossly abused frequently in that (a) is
treated as if constant for all wavelengths. Thus entirely erroneous results are
reached. The present use of the formula merely assumes (a) constant over the
extremely narrow region of spectrum covering the bolometer strip at any given

instant. As thus applied it is believed that good results are reached. If single wave-

where (i) is an instrumentalftactor connected with the width of the slit, the absorp-
tion of the optical surfaces, the quality of the bolometer, and the sensitiveness of the
galvanometer. We may assume (e,) and (k) to be constant for the short space of
time occupied by one day’s observations. We then obtain the following equation:

)’

log. (d)=mp log. (a)+ log. (ke,)

of which the last term is constant. This equation is in the form of the equation of a
straight line, so that if we make a plot in which heights are proportional to

B
logarithms of (d), and horizontal distances to values of (7 B ), the various observa-

tions should determine a straight line the tangent of whose inclination is the quan-
tity log. (a).

The procedure has been followed with many of the energy curves already taken,
and from results of four of the clearest days I select the following data for a few
wave lengths, graphically represented in Fig. 3. The coefficients of transmission are
the percentages of the solar radiation of the given wave lengths which are transmitted
by a vertical column of air at standard barometric pressure. It is not the selective
transmission in bands, but the general transmission at the given wave lengths which
is here in question.

90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It will be noted that though the agreement of these values would not be held
very close in some lines of physical investigation, yet when it is taken into account
that an invisibly thin cloud or an unaccountable disturbance of the galvanometer is
sometimes suflicient to make an energy curve erroneous, the results promise well.
It is yet too early to do more than call attention to the depression in the curve in
the yellow and green at about 0.55 4“. This may be due to the absorption of water
vapor, but experiments here given are preliminary. Results of interest appear
probable in relation to the applicability of Bouguer’s formula to wave lengths where
selective absorption is active, and relating to the variation of atmospheric absorption
through the day and through the year. It will be observed from the preceding table
that the general absorption is least at wave lengths 1.05 4 and 1.30 4” in the infra red,
where the transmission coefficient rises to 95 per cent.

As an illustration of the results obtained from measures of areas, and representing
total radiation for considerable ranges of wave lengths, I call attention to the diagrams
of Plate IX. In these diagrams the horizontal distances represent the time of the year,
the vertical distances the corrected areas or total radiation received, corresponding to
certain selected portions of the curve. The observations on which these selected areas
are based were all made at or near noon. In order that the several spectrum energy
curves might be comparable as regards instrumental conditions, all the directly meas-
ured areas were multiplied by a factor chosen so that, as corrected, the curves would
all be of a uniform height of 10 centimeters at 1.05 4, where the transmission, as I
have just pointed out, is greatest. The upper line in Plate [X represents the total area
included under the energy curve between wave lengths 0.76 2 and 1.98 4. The lower
full line includes the summation of several portions of thisarea known to be least subject
to diminution by the absorption of water vapor, namely, the regions 0.97 s¢ to 1.10 4,
1.16 eto 1.33 44, 1.494 to 1.824. Crossing itat many pointsis a dotted line represent-
ing the summation of the remaining areas, including the great water vapor bands of the
infra red to a wave length of 1.98”. These curves (prolonged through July and August
for additional interest) show how important are the effects of water vapor on the direct
radiations we receive from the sun. In order to compare the several parts of the
curves justly, times equidistant from the June solstice should be selected so that
equal air masses are traversed. The differences in air mass are not sufficient to pro-
duce much effect upon the general absorption in this region, but affect the water-
vapor absorption appreciably. It will be seen that the total solar radiation in the
region between 0.76 se and 1.98 /¢ was on an average fully 15 per cent greater in March
of this present year than in August, on account of the greater absorption of water
vapor. Comparing the separate points, it may be seen that the variation in water-
vapor absorption, while, as we have just seen, on the whole seasonal, is yet very fluc-
tuating from day to day. Thus, for example, it could be inferred from a discussion of
the curve in March that in two apparently equally clear days of the same week there
was a difference of 15 per cent in the solar radiation received, owing to the difference
in water-vapor absorption. In sharp contrast to the variability of the areas of the
water-vapor absorption regions is the behavior of the remaining portion-of the spec-
trum. This contains some secondary but still considerable water-vapor bands,
so that some fluctuation still remains. But it seems possible as a result of this study
that certain large regions, notably that between wave lengths 0.97 4c and 1.10 s, are
so nearly unaffected in area by any terrestrial atmospheric absorption that they can
serve to indicate if the total solar radiation fluctuates from year to year.

Absorption of the solar envelope.—The experiments on the absorption of the solar
envelope briefly mentioned in last year’s report were continued as far as practicable
with the apparatus available. Fig. 4 shows the results thus far reached. Hori-
zontal distances are proportional to wave lengths, vertical distances to transmission
coefficients. These transmission coeflicients are not exactly similar to the ones just
given for the earth’s atmosphere. If we represent the intensity of the radiation we

receive from the center'of the solar disk as unity, then as we measure farther and
farther from the center the intensity will diminish, owing to the absorption the rays
experience in the ever-increasing length of path they traverse in the solar envelope.
Different wave lengths are differently diminished. The figure gives the fractions
remaining for the intensity at points distant 95 per cent and 98 per cent of the radius
from the center. Referring to Fig. 3, we see that in both the solar and the terrestrial
atmosphere the absorption is least in the infra red, and indeed follows a somewhat
similar curve throughout the range of wave lengths here investigated. The accuracy
of the results is not great enough to insist on the significance of the inflections which
appear in the curves given, but here also there is a similarity between the terrestrial
and solar curves. Owing to the imperfection of the large solar image, due to ‘boil-
ing’’ of the air, to the rotation of the field by the siderostat, and to the fact that the
image was enlarged by a convex mirror from about 3 centimeters diameter to 40
centimeters, it seemed useless to attempt projected further measurements, including
some on the radiation of sun spots, until some better way of producing the solar
image was arranged for. Experiments which have been made for this purpose will
be described under another caption.

scale exhibits relative amount of radiation from the edge and center of the sun. Curve 1 is for

I take much pleasure in saying that the work of taking energy curves for deter-
mining solar and terrestrial absorption, the measurements of ordinates and areas,
and preliminary reductions, only a very few of which I have here given, have been
efficiently done by the junior assistant, Mr. F. EH. Fowle.

Sensitive galvanometer.—In my last report I stated at some length the progress made
and looked for in increasing the working sensitiveness of the galvanometer. It was
stated that a modified form of needle system was proposed, much heavier and
probably not less sensitive than those then in use. The design there referred to was
based partly on experiments which had been made which showed that two small
thin magnets could be placed within a distance equal to their own diameter without
suffering much loss of combined magnetic moment. If this proved applicable to a
system of numerous magnets it would be possible to increase the number of mag-
nets to a hundred or more without loss of sensibility overbalancing the gain which
would result from decreasing the relative moment of inertia of the nonmagnetic
material. Shortly after my return from Sumatra a needle system of this kind was
constructed, containing 120 magnets, 60 at each end, separated by spaces equal to
the thickness of the needles. The problem of arranging them thus proved a pretty
difficult one, but was solved, though after a fashion not quite satisfactory. It was
a disappointment to find, however, that the sensitiveness of this system was only
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

one-third as great as that of the very light system then in use. To discover the
cause of this a large number of experiments were made on the magnetic moment of
needles of various sizes and shapes between weights of 0.0006 and 0.0030 milligrams,
and on combinations of them at various distances. In the course of this investigation
it was again shown (as had already been accepted here) that for magnets between the
limits of five and fifty times as long as thick, the magnetic moment is directly propor-
tional to the product of the weight by the ratio of the length to the diameter. This
relation is, and has been for some years, a fundamental consideration in the construc-
tion of galvanometer needles here. But though no error appeared in this assumption, it
was found that the other, that a great number of magnets could be combined without
much loss within a distance apart equal to their diameter, was quite unsound. While
this is the case for two magnets, it is not so for a larger number. They can not
advantageously be placed at a distance apart less than 3 diameters without a consid-
erable loss of total magnetic moment. This is the case whether the needles are first
magnetized and then approached or magnetized in position. It is slightly better to
keep them 4 diameters apart. This condition prevented making needle systems such
as were proposed, but a greater weight of system seemed so very desirable that new
devices were discussed. Six needles in a group seemed to be about the limiting
number which could be used with advantage, so that to get more than 12 needles to
a system required more than 2 groups to put them in. It was proposed to use 16
coils instead of 4 in the galvanometer, thus allowing 8 groups of needles or 48 in all.
This involved a deliberate sacrifice of sensitiveness. Allowing for the several coun-
terbalancing effects, it was computed that the sensitiveness at a time of swing of one
second would be only about one-half or two-thirds as great for a 16-coil instrument
as for a 4-coil instrument of equal resistance. But it was confidently believed that
the steadiness of the former and its better capacity for use at higher times of swing
would more than compensate this loss.

Accordingly a 16-coil galvanometer, with needle system containing 48 magnets and
weighing nearly 10 milligrams, was constructed. Its sensitiveness was found to be
about as computed, and its steadiness is so much superior to that formerly employed,
both as regards drift and tremor, that it has been used since December with most
marked advantage for bolographic work. So entirely satisfactory has it proved that
another 16-coil galvyanometer with needle system, weighing 0.012 grams, has been
constructed for use on the great suspension system of which I spoke last year. A
large number of separate needles are weighed, measured, and their magnetic
moments determined before the 48 are selected, so that no opportunity is allowed for
a few weak ones to lower the sensitiveness and injure the astaticism of the combi-
nation. The system is strongly magnetized after its completion by the aid of a 16-
coil eleetro-magnet. In the making up of these needles to form the system, a new
process of fastening the magnets has been devised by which results very superior to
any heretofore obtained here are reached.

Further experiments on the exhaustion of the air from the galvanometer case have
been made. It was found extremely difficult to prevent leakage of air into the instru-
ment, and this when it occurred caused ‘‘drift.’? This difficulty has at length been
practically overcome. It had been supposed that a pressure of 1 millimeter or there-
abouts would be quite as low as would be necessary with a 10-second single swing.

3ut even with the heavy needle system now in use, the damping became excessive at
2.5 seconds single swingand 0.08 millimeter pressure. The pressure was reduced to0.20
millimeter, and next the time of single swing was raised to 5.5 seconds, before damp-
ing became excessive. The very promising result was reached that the deflection was
proportional to the square of the time of swing up to a time of single swing of above 5
seconds. Further exhaustion of the air proved impossible at the time, owing to the
vapor pressure of the wax and grease used about the galvanometer. But by a modi-
fication of the outer case, it is believed that this difficulty can be overcome, and that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

the aim last year set forth to carry the proportionality between deflection and square
of the time of swing up to 10 Seconds single swing will at length be reached. Great
steadiness was observed at 5!5 seconds swing. <A deflection of 1 millimeter on the
scale then actually corresponded to a current of only ygo000 000000 @mperes in the
galvanometer. The resistance of the instrument is only 1.60hms. A current of one-

tenth this magnitude—or 510 * amperes—could actually have been measured,
Further advance is confidently expected.

Personal-equation machine.—Y ou haye placed at the Observatory for trial an instru-
ment of your own design intended to eliminate the so-called personal equation of
individual observers in transit observations. The principle of this instrument con-
sists in substituting a jadgment of the place where a sudden phenomenon occurred
for the time when it occurred. To use an illustration which you have already
employed, in case the dark field in which only the star is seen moving were illumi-
nated every two seconds by a self-recording flash which showed the central wire,
and if by pure accident the star was caught in an exact bisection when the flash
came—an accident against which the chances are perhaps more than a hundred
to one—it is evident that in this rare and improbable event there would be no per-
sonal equation to allow for, if the time of flash within two seconds were noted by
the obseryer. Now, the object of the following mechanism may be said to be to
make this accident happen every time.

This being understood, as first tried with the apparatus which you furnished, the
design was to illuminate the cross wires of the transit instrument by automatically
recorded electric flashes occurring at regular intervals equal to the time elapsing
between passages of the staracross successive wires. An adjustable mechanism allowed
the observer to hasten or defer the whole system of flashes until by successive adjust-
ments he caught the exact instant when the star was bisected by the dark wire in
the instantaneously bright field. Several such adjustments could be made during a
single star transit across the numerous wires of the tally, and immediately after each
satisfactory bisection a signal was made on the chronograph by a key in the hand of
the observer, so that only such recorded flashes as were thus distinguished were used
in determining the time of transit.

In order to test the value of this instrument an artificial star was caused to move
through the field at a rate about equal to that of a real equatorial star. This star
was moved by a screw and clockwork of great accuracy, and always through the
same portion of the screw. It was also provided that when the star was exactly
bisected by the middle wire an electrical contact was broken, so that the star recorded
its own transit upon the chronograph. The adjustment of the contact for this bisee-
tion was made at leisure with the star stationary, and was therefore not subject to
the personal error of transif| observations. Accordingly, after determining all the
wire intervals, it was entirely easy to measure the personal equation of the observer,
whether he used the personal-equation machine or the ordinary method, merely by
comparing his observed time of transit with that recorded by the star itself. Upon
trial it was found that the personal equation of the several observers was not wholly
prevented by employing the machine in the manner described; that is, by bisections
judged during instantaneous flashes. The writer, for example, observed about 6.12
second too early by both methods.

It seemed probable that the observer was still biased in his judgment by watching
the march of the star through the field across the very faintly showing wires, which
are always to be made out by the stray light of the star and sky, even though there
isno illumination by the flash. Accordingly it seemed to promise success to alter
the arrangement so that the star would be hidden except at the instants correspond-
ing to those when the flash had formerly appeared, and to steadily illuminate the
field as is usual in transit instruments. In the test this was easier than in actual

‘

practice, for the artificial star itself could be obscured by a shutter immediately in
front of it, which could be removed instantaneously by the electric signal from the
personal-equation machine. The same thing could, however, be done at the focal
plane of the telescope in real use.

Upon trial this device justified all hopes. Three observers whose habit is to
observe, one too early, one too late and the other very close to the true time, were
found all to observe as close to the truth as the accidental errors would admit,
which in the case of the 3-foot focus transit instrument employed was generally
within 0.03 second. In other words, personal equation seems to be wholly eliminated
by this procedure. The general design may be applied without great expense to any
outfit of transit and chronograph.

Provision for great solar image.—As already said, the experiments on solar absorp-
tion, nature of sun spots and other phenomena required for their successful continu-
ation a large solar image free from rotation and as free as possible from ‘‘boiling”’
and from optical defects. Among these latter it will be evident that variations in
absorption and in magnification at different portions of the image were quite serious,
as well as the ordinary defects of definition. To magnify a small image to the
required diameter seemed to be very undesirable, for several reasons, chief of which
were the optical defects just spoken of and the increased ‘‘boiling’’ due to the
heating at the small focal image. The use of the siderostat was objectionable on
account of its rotating the field.

You have therefore decided to use the coelostat and a concave mirror of long
enough focus to form the image of the desired size without a secomd magnifica-
tion. The coelostat, which I understand you to have been first employed by you
as a working instrument on a large scale (in 1882), is essentially a plane mirror
rotating on an axis parallel with the axis of the earth at the rate of one revolution
in forty-eight hours. It is unable to send the reflected beams from objects at dif-
ferent declinations in the same direction, and if used to provide a horizontal
reflected beam from the sun, must send it in a more southerly direction in summer
than in winter. In this latitude the extreme directions reached by a horizontal
coelostat beam would be, respectively, about 30° north and 30° south of an east and
west line. To avoid moving the concave mirror and other apparatus to suit the
shifting direction of the coelostat beam, it has been determined to place a second
movable plane mirror close to the coelostat to reflect the beam to the concave mirror,
retaining the latter fixed. This mirror is so mounted that it can be wheeled north
or south along a track situated as close to the coelostat as possible. This track is
designed to curve round the south end of the coelostat so that the second mirror can
be either east or west of the coelostat as desired, and it is intended to use it east in
the morning and west in the afternoon. A concaye mirror of 18 inches aperture and
140 feet focus which you have ordered will be placed about 60 feet north of the
coelostat. Its beam on the way to its focus will pass directly under the coelostat
mirror and between the morning and afternoon positions of the second plane mirror.
The coelostat mirror is thus about 2 feet higher than the concave mirror and about
1 foot higher than the second mirror, so that the latter casts no shadow on the
coelostat mirror except for very low sun at the times of the equinoxes. On account
of the unfavorable inclination of the coelostat mirrors at certain times of the year
and day, it is determined also to provide for the use of the two plane mirrors as a
polar siderostat, since only slight changes are required to alter a polar siderostat into
a coelostat, and the reverse. If used asa polar siderostat, the gain in effective mirror
surface will be offset by having a rotating image.

In either case, as thus arranged, it is possible to completely inclose the beam of
light in suitable tubes after it reaches the coelostat, and even before, by a tube moved
to follow the sun. The only use of such tubes is to prevent the ‘‘ boiling’? or appar-
ent motion around the edges of the image due to air waves in the path of the beam,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95

and several quite decisive experiments were made by your direction to determine
their effectiveness. et oe

Experiments on ‘“‘boiling’”’ of the image.—I add a few words, partly in anticipation,
in reference to your newly-introduced device for preventing the well-known effect
of ‘‘boiling’’ the telescopic image, a difficulty due to the earth’s atmosphere and
which has existed always and everywhere, and which has seemed until lately so
insurmountable that it has not even been thought of as subject to correction. The
device that you have suggested consists essentially not in keeping the air still within
and without the telescope ttbe, but in violently agitating it over as great a range as
possible. For this purpose, under your instructions and with the object of rehears-
ing on a small scale what, if the device is successful, will be later tried on a large one,
a silvered glass mirror of 5 inches diameter and 40 feet focus has been set up in a tube

99

with several concentric walls, so as to leave the interior air as still as possible. In
preliminary experiments the air, in spite of these precautions in the installation, gave
such ‘‘boiling’’ of the image as to seriously prejudice the definition, and this,
although the 40-foot tube had no less than three walls, being 7 inches in interior
diameter and 15 inches in exterior diameter, and inclosing the beam all the way from
asecond plane mirror near the coelostat to the concave mirror and thence to the focus.
Though this tube containing the stillest air of the most uniform temperature was
sheltered throughout by a canvas tent, the ‘“‘boiling’’? was but a little diminished.
Nothing was gained by diminishing the aperture of the several mirrors down to 1
inch in diameter, and all this was only what had been anticipated from the ordinary
experience of astronomers. A 12-inch blower run by an electric motor was now
caused to exhaust air from the inner tube at a half dozen points along the tube, and
to force air in at other points alternate with these, so as thus violently to disturb or
“churn”? the air by forcing a vigorous circulation of it along the whole path of the
beam from the ccelostat to the solar image. This unquestionably reduced the ‘‘boil-
ing.” An artificial star was now provided at the focal plane, the plane mirror near
the ccelostat was placed at right angles to the tube, and thus the concave mirror, act-
ing as both collimator and objective, brought the star image to focus at the star itself.
Here it was examined with an eyepiece. With still air the definition was often very
poor. The image assumed very variable shapes, with wings or streamers; and being
also colored by diffraction effects, reminded one of a kaleidoscope field. On starting
the blower the definition immediately became sharp. Violently stirring the air in
the tube, therefore, eliminates the ‘“‘boiling’’ within the tube and (paradoxically )
produces a still image. As before said, the solar image was clearly improved by the
stirring; but further improvement was still to be desired. Accordingly a tin tube 44
feet long, with two walls of 11 inches interior diameter and 16 inches exterior
diameter, was provided and arranged to point toward the sun, as shown in Plate VJ,
so that the beam passed down through it before reaching the mirror system. This
tube was connected to the blower exactly like the horizontal one, and both could
be stirred at once. There was very marked ‘‘boiling’’ before starting the blower.
This nearly disappéared while the blower was running. One observer estimated
the ‘‘boiling’’ as four-fifths overcome; another thought little more than a quarter
remained, and all were unanimous that what was left was very little prejudicial to
the definition. This last result is so surprising that I feel constrained to add that
the experiments so far are not exhaustive, having been carried on but a short time,
and without that solidity of piers which would allow of exact estimate or photo-
graphic determination of the ‘‘ boiling’? of the solar image before and during agita-
tion of the air in the tube, as distinguished from mechanical jarring. Further experi-
ments are in progress. That agitation is of very great advantage to diminish ‘‘boil

ing’’ there is no question, but the exact measure of the advantage for all cireum-
stances of bad seeing requires further study. Incidentally, the air blast has the added
advantage of keeping the mirrors at uniform temperature, This and the abolish-
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ment of ‘‘boiling’’ in the tube are found to prevent those vexatious changes of focus
so common in solar work.

These experiments, which I am free to say seemed to me when first proposed by
you of a kind to increase rather than diminish ‘‘boiling,’’ have in fact proved
thus far almost wholly successful in eliminating it. The experiment with an ordi-
nary equatorial has not yet been tried, but for a horizontal telescope, such as is here
proposed, the scheme is demonstrable and feasible.

Radiation of the Cuban firefly.—tn continuance of your observations on the
cheapest form of light, two specimens of Pyrophorus noctilucus were loaned to
the Observatory by kindness of Professor Howard, of the Agricultural Depart-
ment. The radiation of the thoracic-light regions of these insects was briefly
studied by the aid of the bolometer and photometer. The insect was placed
in the center of curvature of a concave mirror of 50 centimeters aperture and 1
meter focus. In the conjugate focus was the most sensitive bolometric arrange-
ment in the possession of the Observatory, connected to the galvanometer used for
bolographic work. <A glass plate was placed before the bolometer to cut off body
radiation. Nothing whatever could be observed to indicate any heating effect from
the light of the insect. A portion of the flame of a standard sperm candle equal in
area to the light spot of the insect gave such a deflection that had the radiation from
the insect been zo}y5 as great in amount it could not have escaped observation. On
comparing the light from the candle and that from the insect by the aid of a pho-
tometer it was found that area for area the insect’s light-giving capacity was one-
eighth as great as that of the candle. Its actual candlepower was ;z,55. Not
counting the very considerable candle radiation not transmissible by glass, it there-
fore appeared that the firefly gave his light at less than ;555 the expenditure of
energy required for an equal light from the standard sperm candle. You will be
gratified that while these observations,evidently confirm your earlier experiments
they show the great advance since then in the sensitiveness of the bolometer.

PERSONNEL.

The observing staff has been unchanged with the following exceptions: Dr. C. E.
Mendenhall was employed as temporary assistant up to August 3, 1901, and Dr.
N. E. Gilbert as temporary assistant, beginning June 16, 1902.

SUMMARY.

During the past year satisfactory progress has been made in the improvement of
the galvanometer. Suecessful experiments have been made under the system first
proposed by you by which personal equation in transit observations is avoided, and
still others, which seem to be of great practical importance, by which the ‘‘boiling”’
of the telescopic image either of sun or star shows promise of being largely overcome.
A comparison of the light and heat of the standard sperm candle with that of the
firefly showed the latter to be more than 10,000 times more economical as a source
of light.

The great purpose of the observatory—the investigation of the sun and of its influ-
ence on the earth—has been at all times continued.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Str: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902.

The number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts recorded in the
accession books of the Smithsonian deposit, Library of Congress, during the fiscal
year is shown in the following table:

The accession numbers run from 438,893 to 445,523.

The greater part of these publications have been sent to the Library of Congress,
amounting during the past year to something over 188 boxes, 25 bags and packages,
which are estimated to have contained the equivalent of 8,520 octavo volumes, this
being a sending independent of that of the International Exchanges.

The decrease in the number of entries in the accession book and the periodical
record as compared with last year will be accounted for by the large number of
strictly Government documents which the Smithsonian Institution now sends direct
to the Library of Congress through the Bureau of International Exchanges. This
arrangement has been carried on in accordance with the understanding had between
the Secretary and the Librarian of Congress.

The additions to the libraries of the Secretary, the Office, and the Astrophysical

making a total of 3,083 and a grand total of 29,741. On the card catalogue of serial
publications about 22,234 entries were made.
The universities at the following places have sent inaugural dissertations and

academic publications:

98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The policy of increasing the library by exchange has been continued with fayor-
able results. In carrying this out, 877 letters were written for new exchanges and
for completing series already in the library; 317 periodicals were added to the list;
451 defective series were either completed or partly filled, according to the pub-
lisher’s ability to supply the numbers requested. About 1,800 letters were received
and filed in jackets on which a synopsis of each letter is given.

The card catalogue of correspondence for reference has been continued, as well as
the issuing of orders for Smithsonian publications sent in exchange. When single
numbers are reported as missing, postal cards are forwarded requesting that they be
supplied. Corresponding postal cards are sent as acknowledgments of receipts.
About 1,090 numbers were asked for, and 703 supplied.

The reference room and the reading room, the proceedings and transactions of
learned societies being in the former and the scientific periodicals in the latter, have
been used not only by the staff of the Smithsonian Institution, but by many other
departments of the Government. In the reading room alone 3,208 periodicals and
25 bound volumes were withdrawn for consultation.

The sectional library at the National Zoological Park has been added to, and the
collection is growing in importance.

In the Institution there are maintained, besides the Secretary’s library, the office
library, the employees’ library, three sectional libraries—Aerodromics, International
Exchanges, and Law Reference.

In the Astrophysical Observatory attention has been given to the sets of period-
icals. These were gone over, missing parts ordered, and 46 volumes bound.

The employees’ library has increased in popularity, and during August last a
branch extension was made to the Zoological Park. The books are placed in an
upright box made for the purpose, with a capacity of 40 volumes, and sent out once
amonth. The library now contains 1,370 volumes, and during the year 2,379 books
were borrowed.

The librarian haying, with the permission of the Secretary, relinquished his posi-
tion as custodian of the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Congress, to render
possible his attention to certain duties outside of the Institution, Mr. Paul Brockett
was on April 1, 1902, appointed assistant librarian of the Smithsonian Institution
and custodian of the Smithsonian deposit.

Mr. Brockett will attend to matters relating to the Smithsonian Institution
library and the Institution’s interests at the Library of Congress. During the few
months he has been in the library he has made himself familiar with the various
details of the office and the Smithsonian deposit.

Early in November, 1901, Gen. John Watts de Peyster presented to the Institution his
magnificent collection of books and pamphlets relating to Napoleon Bonaparte, to be
known as the ‘‘Watts de Peyster Collection, Napoleon Bonaparte.’? It is a very
complete one, containing books from all countries and in all languages. In it I have
noticed many rare volumes, and the valuation of $10,000, put upon it by General de
Peyster, I think very low, for a number of the books were long ago out of print and
have now reached the point where no price can be put upon them. There have
been received from General de Peyster nearly 2,000 yolumes, which are now in tem-
porary cases, but the number of books has outgrown the space provided. A running
list has been made and sent to General de Peyster for his information, and ata
very early date suggestions for the permanent care and the making of a card cata-
logue of this collection will be presented for your consideration.

The art room has received considerable attention, and, in accordance with the Sec-
retary’s wish, the collection of photographs of representative portraits by the old
masters has been returned from the Buffalo Exposition and hung upon the walls in
chronological order. The question of extending the Parthenon frieze around the
entire room has been taken up and it is hoped that it will be in place during the
summer.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SAS,

With the allotment from the Smithsonian Institution funds for the maintenance
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, a regional bureau has been
established and the work carried on. The temporary provision for the coming year
will warrant only the employment of the same foree, which is entirely inadequate
to properly care for the numerous duties imposed. A sum of at least $10,000 per
annum is needed for the United States Regional Bureau, and it is hoped that Congress
will, now that the publication is actually begun, appropriate the necessary funds for
the representation of the United States in an undertaking which will render aid to
all branches of scientific learning throughout the country.

The work done for the year ending June 30, 1902, is in brief as follows: (1) The
general organization of a regional bureau, including means of collecting and dispos-
ing of all scientific matter published in the United States; (2) making a list of the
periodicals of the United States coming within the scope of the catalogue; (3) pre-
paring and classifying index reference slips to the scientific publications of 1901 and
forwarding these slips to the London Central Bureau. The slips forwarded up to
June 30, 1901, number 6,990. The first two volumes of the International Catalogue
of Scientific Literature for 1901 have appeared. They are: Botany, Part I, of 1901,
and Chemistry, Part I, of 1901, and were published in May and June of the present
year.

The crowded condition of the National Museum Library has been relieved by the
addition of galleries in two of the halls of the Museum building. These contain a
total floor space of 2,592 square feet. During the coming year the entire series of
scientific publications wiltbe rearranged, thus increasing the usefulness of the library.

The files of periodicals have been gone over and the missing numbers obtained.
Owing to the small force, this has been done at odd times when the regular work
would allow, and has resulted in the completing of 31 of the 106 sets examined.

The accessions number a total of 19,553 books, pamphlets, and periodicals, of
which 3,660 were a portion of the Smithsonian deposit; 23,149 books were borrowed.
The number of periodicals entered was 9,297, and 2,189 cards were added to the
Authors’ Catalogue of the Museum Library. This last does not include, however,
1,605 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued.

The sectional libraries established in the Museum are as follows:

Adininistration. Fishes. Oriental archzeology.
Administrative assistant. Geology. Paleobotany.
Anthropology. History. Parasites.

Biology. Insects. Photography.

Birds. Mamunals. Prehistoric anthropology.
Botany. Marine invertebrates. Xeptiles.

REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-
TUTION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM, PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION,
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, 1901.

Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report on the Pan-American Exposi-
tion, held at Buffalo, N. Y., from May 1, 1901, to November 2, 1901, inclusive:

Participation in this exposition by the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum
was provided for in the act of Congress, approved March 3, 1899, appropriating the sum
of $200,000 for a Government building and the sum of $300,000 for a Government
exhibit. Of the latter sum $50,000 was allotted to the Institution and Museum, and
$2,500 was transferred from the allotment of the Interior Department for the joint
preparation of a restoration of the gigantic extinct American reptile known as T7i-
ceratops. Subsequently the Smithsonian allotment was assessed $1,960.79 for a gen-
eral exhibit from the Philippine Islands to be prepared under the supervision of a
special committee of Government board, and $200 was transferred to the allotment
of the War Department. The net Smithsonian allotment was, therefore, $50,339.21.

All the dependencies of the Institution were represented by separate displays
except the Bureau of American Ethnology, which cooperated with the Department
of Anthropology in the National Museum. s

The space in the Government building assigned to the Institution and Museum was
at the northwest corner and comprised about 7,500 square feet, having a frontage on
the main aisle of about 133 feet and a depth of 56 feet.

The act of Congress providing for the Government exhibit stipulated that it should
comprise ‘‘such articles and material as illustrate the function and administrative
faculty of the Government in time of peace and * * * tending to demonstrate
the nature of our institutions and their adaptation to the wants of the people.’’
Following out the spirit of the law, the exhibits of the Institution and Museum were
planned to show their scope and methods of work, and at the same time to indicate
their resources.

In the case of the National Museum such topics were chosen for illustration as
were germane to the central idea of the exposition, namely, a display of the prod-
ucts of nature and the works of man in the Western Hemisphere. The Museum on
this occasion, as previously, prepared much larger exhibits than the other bureaus
of the Institution, on account of its peculiar functions and resources which fit it to
participate extensively in enterprises of this kind. The displays of the other bureaus
were necessarily limited, for the most part, to such pictures, models, and publications
as would serve to indicate the material with which and the conditions under which
their work is carried on, and some of the results of their activities.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER.

The work of the Smithsonian Institution covers fields more varied than is gener-
ally supposed. It may be a surprise to many to know that by the Congressional act
of its foundation it is devoted primarily to art and only secondarily to science. One
of its interests, which has not hitherto been presented in a temporary exposition, is
the fostering of art. To impress on the minds of the public the fact that this is a

110
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. gba aE

feature of the work of the Institution, two series of reproductions of paintings were
exhibited, one representing ‘the history of painting and the second the history of
portraiture. These two important topics could be illustrated only in outline on
account of limited space, but the series included reproductions of a considerable
number of the greatest paintings and portraits of all epochs and schools.

In addition, the exhibit of the Institution included a complete set of its publica-
tions and those of its bureaus; portraits of the secretaries; personal relics of James
Smithson; a cast of the bronze tablet recently placed on the tomb of Smithson at
Genoa, Italy; a copy of the seal of the Institution; objects and papers relating to
the Hodgkins fund, including publications, medals, and a portrait of the founder,
Thomas G. Hodgkins; two large photographs of the eerodrome of Secretary Lang-
ley; a picture of the Smithsonian building; and copies of the history of the first
half century of the Smithsonian Institution.

The exhibit of the Institution was installed in the extreme northwest corner of
the building. It was assembled, under the direction of the Secretary, by Dr. Richard
Rathbun, Assistant Secretary.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

As already stated, this Bureau made no separate exhibit at Buffalo, but codperated
with the department of anthropology of the National Museum. Dr. W J McGee,
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, made an expedition to Sonora, Mexico, for the
purpose of obtaining a collection representing the arts of the Seri Indians. On
reaching their country, however, he found that the tribe was exterminated, and he
then turned his attention to the Cocopa Indians, from whom he obtained an impor-
tant collection.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The chief exhibit of the park was an elaborate relief model showing the topo-
graphical features of the grounds and the location of the animal houses, paddocks,
ranges, and cages. This was supplemented by photographs of some of the principal
houses and of picturesque points in the park.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

It will be appreciated that the work of the Bureau of Exchanges does not lend itself
to exhibition by material objects. The exhibit at Buffalo consisted of a set of Govern-
ment publications such as are distributed annually to other governments throughout
the world, and a series of photographs showing the interior of the oflices of the Bureau
in Washington and the receipt and dispatch of consignments of scientific publications.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The exhibit of this Bureau was selected and prepared, under the direction of the
Secretary of the Institution.

The principal object in the exhibit was a photograph of the infra-red end of the
solar spectrum, showing the work of the Observatory on this subject for a period of
years. The photograph was enlarged so as to have a length of about 20 feet, and
was displayed on the north wall. There was also exhibited a series of photographs
of the solar eclipse, as observed at Waynesboro, N. C.

In a table case near by was shown a copy of Volume I of the Annals of the Astro-
physical Observatory, a new serial publication containing the results of the work of
the Observatory. The following objects were also exhibited: The bolometer, or
electric thermometer, an extremely sensitive instrument, the invention ot Mr.
Langley, used in measuring the heat of the invisible spectrum of the sun, the tem-
perature of the stars, ete.; photographs of other instruments used in the Observatory,
such as the siderostat, galvanometer, and spectrometer; photographs ot the exterior
and interior of the Observatory buildings in the Smithsonian grounds.
112 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The exhibit of the National Museum, as on previous occasions, occupied very
much more space than those of the other bureaus of the Institution.

It was planned to show the scope and methods of the Museum and at the same
time to illustrate as far as practicable some topic germane to the general idea of the
exposition implied in the name Pan-American. The three administrative depart-
ments made separate exhibits, but the lines of separation between the various sub-
divisions in these departments were not recognized in every instance.

Department of Anthropology.—The exhibit of this department of the Museum was
planned and prepared by Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator, assisted by the scientific
staff. It occupied the south end of the Museum space.

This exhibit was planned with the view of representing the various aboriginal
peoples of America and the material products of their activities.

Groups of lay figures.—Twelve of these groups were exhibited, each representing a
family (man, woman, and children), and each with an appropriate setting, indicating
customs, arts, and general environment. Many of the figures were prepared espe-
cially for this exposition by skilled sculptors and preparators, under the personal
direction of the head curator, and were the best objects of the kind the Museum has
ever exhibited. The two largest groups—those of the Greenland Eskimo and Pata-
gonians—occupied cases 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. The other 10 groups were
somewhat smaller. A complete list is as follows: (1) North Greenland Eskimo; (2)
Eastern Eskimo; (3) Alaskan Eskimo; (4) Chilcat Indians, Alaska; (5) Hupa Indians,
California; (6) Sioux Indians of the Great Plains; (7) Navajo Indians of the arid
region of the United States; (8) Zuni Indians of the arid region; (9) Cocopa
Indians, Sonora, Mexico; (10) Maya Quiche Indians, Guatemala; (11) a Zapotec
Indian woman, Mexico, a Jivaro Indian man and a Piro Indian man, Brazil; (12)
Tehuelche Indians, Patagonia. Nos. 2, 3, and 11 were not completed as family
groups.

Dwelling group models. —This series consisted of thirteen models, each about 4 feet
long and 2 feet wide, representing the houses and outbuildings and appurtenances
occupied by a family or communal group. The following is a list of those models:
(1) Snow houses of the Eskimo: (2) earth house of Alaskan Eskimo; (3) wooden
dwellings of the northwest coast Indians; (4) skin and bark covered lodges of the
Montagnais Indians, Labrador; (5) dwellings of the Sierra Digger Indians, California;
(6) skin lodges of the Great Plains Indians; (7) grass houses of the Wichita Indians
of Indian Territory; (8) earth lodges of the Pawnee Indians, Dakota; (9) cliff dwell-
ings (ruins), Arizona; (10) grass and adobe houses of Papago Indians, old style,
Arizona; (11) grass and adobe houses of Papago Indians, late forms; (12) pile dwell-
ings of the Venezuela tribes; (13) skin shelters of the Patagonians.

Exhibits illustrating leading activities of American aborigines.—These exhibits, thir-
teen in number, were designed to show the status of various American native races
as regards culture. Theseries presented were as follows: (1) Fire-making apparatus;
(2) bows and arrows; (3) throwing sticks; (4)*harpoons; (5) water craft; (6) bas-
ketry; (7) woven fabries; (8) pottery; (9) sculpture; (10) personal-ornament neck-
laces; (11) tobaceo pipes; (12) pictography and writing; (13) musical instruments.

These series were shown in standard Museum cases, 8} feet long and 7 feet high,
and comprised many hundred objects of importance and general interest.

Department of Biology.—The exhibit of this department of the Museum was planned
and prepared by Dr. F. W. True, head curator, with the assistance of the staff of
the divisions of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes.

The exhibit of the department was projected in harmony with the general theme
of the exposition and only American animals were exhibited. As space was limited
only vertebrate animals were included. In order to fill gaps in the series as far as
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ‘ke

possible and to make the collection more significant, small collecting expeditions
were sent out to Cuba, Porto Rico, Florida, and the Amazon River. These obtained
many fine characteristic specimens _not previously well represented in the Museum
collections. The exhibit as a whole represented very satisfactorily the most impor-
tant, interesting, and attractive American vertebrates, both large and small.

Mammals.—The collection of mammals included such large forms as the moose,
elk, musk ox, Caribbean seal, Kodiak bear, wolf, puma, manatee, mountain sheep,
mountain goat, etc. A considerable number of specimens were mounted especially
for the exposition, and represented the best efforts of modern taxidermy. Several
important species recently discovered, such as the Glacier bear, Kodiak bear, Stone’s
sheep, etc., were included in the exhibit.

Birds.—The collection of birds was the largest series displayed by the department.
Such large characteristic birds as the condor, wild turkey, whooping crane, Cali-
fornia vulture, etc., were represented by exceedingly fine specimens, mounted in the
very best manner. The smaller birds included numerous species remarkable for
their brilliant colors, pecuhar habits, or grotesque form, and as a whole the series
was calculated to give the visitor an excellent idea of the variety and beauty of the
American bird fauna as a whole. An extensive collection of humming birds, an
exclusively American family, was shown in a special case.

Reptiles and batrachians.—The collection of these two classes was much smaller
than the others, as the Museum had no considerable exhibition series ready at hand
to draw upon, and to obtain suitable material within a specified time is a matter of
the greatest difficulty. Thenumber of suitable specimens finally obtained, however,
proved greater than could be accommodated in the small space which it seemed
prudent at the outset of the enterprise to allot to these two classes, which space was
at the last moment still further reduced to provide the necessary aisle room. Some
such remarkable forms as the mata-mata tortoise and the large Amazon River tor-
toise, though ready for exhibition, were finally crowded out.

The exhibit included the more important American poisonous and nonpoisonous
snakes, various fresh-water and land tortoises, characteristic lizards, including the
large Cuban iguana, and a few toads, frogs, salamanders, and other amphibians.
Among the largest specimens was a tortoise known as the alligator snapper, which is
the largest of American fresh-water tortoises, and a boa constrictor.

Fishes.—The collection of American fishes was in three divisions: (1) A general
series of painted casts of characteristic marine and fresh-water species; (2) a series of
subtropical marine fishes from Key West, Fla., preserved in formalin; and (3) a series
of the fishes of the Amazon River, also preserved in formalin. The collection
included the best casts in the Museum permanent series. It is impracticable to
mention the species in detail in this place, but the series as a whole was especially
strong in important food and game fishes of the lakes and rivers of North America,
and of the Atlantic coast, and characteristic South American species.

A special exhibit in this class consisted of an enlarged model of a remarkable phos-
phorescent deep-sea fish, so installed that the luminous spots in the sides aud the
lantern-like protuberance on the head were made to glow as in life.

The mammals exhibited by the Department of Biology were installed in two large
wall cases, each 40 feet long, in the center of the Museum space, the fishes in a
similar but shallow case at the west end, the birds in eight standard Museum ‘‘ door-
screen’’ cases, and the reptiles and batrachians in four standard ‘‘slope-top’’ cases.

A large proportion of the specimens in each of the five classes were provided with
descriptive labels in nontechnical language, in which the habits and geographical
range of each species were cited, together with other items of general interest.

Department of Geology.—The exhibit of this department was planned and arranged
by Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator, with the assistance of the scientific staff. It
occupied the north end of the Museum space.

114 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The exhibit followed, as far as circumstances would permit, the lines of the
permanent exhibition series of the Museum. Fach division of the department was
represented, and in addition there was included a full-sized restoration of the skeleton
of the huge extinct American reptile Triceratops, prepared and exhibited conjointly
by the Museum and the United States Geological Survey.

Division of Geology.—The display made by this division comprised three seeris, (1)
a collection of rocks from the Hawaiian Islands, (2) a series of native elements, (3)
a series of concretionary forms. The collection of Hawaiian rocks, which occupied
one case, consisted mainly of specimens obtained by the United States Exploring
Expedition in 1840, by Mr. A. B. Lyon in 1892, and Prof. C. H. Hitchcock in 1899.
The rocks of these islands are all of igneous character, except the limestones of the
coral reefs along the shores.

The series of native elements comprised those sixteen, such as sulphur, arsenic,
gold, ete., which occur in an uncombined state in the earth’s crust. The full series
was as follows: Carbon, sulphur, selenium, telurium, arsenic, antimony, bismuth,
old, silver, copper, lead, mercury, platinum, iridosmine (iridium and osmium ), and
iron. This collection was installed in a special case, and particular care was taken
with the details of mounting to emphasize its significance. Among the most inter-
esting objects included were a very perfect crystal of diamond from South Africa
(representing carbon) and a nugget of platinum from Russia weighing 444 grams.

The series of concretionary forms included specimens of orbicular granites from
Rhode Island, Sweden, and Finland, and of septarian concretions of clay ironstone
from New York, Kansas, and Weymouth, England, and other localities. These
occupied a wall case.

Division of Mineralogy.—The exhibit of this division consisted of an extensive series
of minerals, very carefully classified, arranged, and labeled to illustrate the methods
employed by the Museum when exhibiting large, systematic collections. The series
comprised about 500 specimens and was accompanied by 47 group labels in addition
to individual labels for each specimen. It occupied four standard Museum “‘slope-
top’’ floor cases.

Division of Stratigraphic Paleontology—Section of Invertebrate Fossils.—This section
exhibited two series of invertebrate fossils, crinoids and cephalopods.

The crinoids, or stone lilies, were represented by specimens of 94 genera, and the
cephalopods (cuttlefish, squids, etc.) by specimens of 146 genera. They were
accompanied by descriptive labels, the technical terms in which were explained by
a special series of specimens artificially colored to draw attention to the particular
parts referred to. The collection was installed in tive standard Museum ‘door
screen’ cases.

Section of Vertebrate Fossils.—On account of the limited space, but few vertebrate fos-
sils could be exhibited. The exhibit consisted of a full-size restoration of the skel-
eton of the Tertiary American reptilc, Triceratops, mention of which has already been
made: a skeleton of a cretaccous fossil toothed bird, Hesperornis; a restoration of the
skeleton of Zeuglodon, an extinct whale-like mammal from the Eocene, and bones
and skulls of the mastodon, mammoth, and titanotherium.

In the case of Triceratops, a small model and painting showing the probable
external appearance of the animal were exhibited with the restoration of the skel-
eton, and a large oil painting representing the creature in its native fields was dis-
played on an adjacent wall.

Dr. F.W. True, representative for the Institution and Museum on the Government
board, was also chairman of the special committee on exhibits from the Outlying
Possessions of the United States. Mr. W. V. Cox, chief special agent, was also see-
retary of the Government board.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1902.
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 188s.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1902.

RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS, AND DEDUCTIONS
TO BE DRAWN THEREFROM, REGARDING THE FUTURE
OF AERIAL NAVIGATION.¢

By Maj. B. F. S. Bapen-PowE Lt.

It is with feelings of the greatest satisfaction that I am now able
for the first time to address the society in the capacity of its presi-
dent, and I must seize this opportunity of expressing to you my
heartfelt thanks for the very great honor whieh you have conferred
upon me by electing me to this position. I can not but feel that my
labors in the past, though varied and dipping into almost every branch
of aeronautics, have not been so extensive or so prominent as to war-
rant my selection for this important post, but nevertheless I sincerely
hope that, with freer opportunities, | may, in the immediate future,
be able to accomplish much more in the work we have before us.

My absence from England during the last three years, on active
service in South Africa, has prevented my fulfilling many important
duties for the society during a period of unusual activity and impor-
tance, but, on the other hand, the time { have spent on the ‘*trackless
veldt,” and in the monotony of camp life, has not, I hope, been
wasted, as ample opportunity has been afforded for careful meditation
and consideration of the whole subject which it is the object of this
society to study. I therefore propose not so much to give a technical
lecture on the various experiments of recent years—you have had
better opportunities than I of studying these—as to endeavor to make
clear our present position.

During these three years many great events have taken place in the
aeronautical world. Count Zeppelin’s monster air ship, built on sound
scientific principles, of enormous size and quite different in design to
anything made before, has been completed, and has made successful
ascents, although, | much regret to have to add, has not succeeded
in traveling through the air at a sufficient speed to warrant its being
considered a practical success.

AD RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS.

Then we come to M. Santos-Dumont’s many more or less successful
trips in his navigable balloons, which, if not demonstrating any new
principles, has shown what perseverance and attention to detail can
ichieve. Though we have learned some useful practical lessons, and
have been given data of great value for future experimenting, unfor-
tunately the actual results attained carry us so little beyond what was
accomplished twenty years before by MM. Renard and Krebs that
one begins to think whether we have not nearly reached the end of the
tether as regards the propulsion of balloons.

The unfortunate calamities to M. Severo’s and more recently to M.
de Bradsky’s balloons, as well as the absolute failure of M. Roze and
others, only tend to confirm this growing opinion. The latest
accounts of M. Lebaudy’s balloon seem to make out that it has accom-
plished more, but we must await the results of more prolonged trials
before we can come to any decision. Mr. Stanley Spencer’s trip over
London ina navigable balloon, though it proved nothing as regards
the dirigibility or inherent speed of the machine, attracted some
interest in the matter.

Besides these we have heard of various experiments with flying
machines proper. Herr Kress is said to have risen off the surface of
the water, but owing to some mismanagement the machine turned
downwards and fell in the water again. In Australia Mr. Hargrave
has constructed a large machine. In America Mr. Wilbur Wright
and his brother have been making wonderful progress with gliding
machines, and Professor Langley has been hard at work constructing
a large new machine. He informed me the other day that ina very
short time we might expect to hear something of this—something big.
It might, he added, be a big smash! But he wisely intends trying it
over water.

Then, too, like the invisible universe of dark stars that Sir Robert
Ball talks about as being possibly more extensive than that of those
seen, there are probably more inventions being worked at in private
than we ever hear of publicly, and many of them are doubtless of
ereat importance. It is only recently that the results have been pub-
lished of the valuable experiments with aerial-screw propellers which
Mr. W. G. Walker conducted for Mr. Alexander.

Another sign of progress in the subject. of aeronautics during the
last few years has been the establishment in England of two more
public bodies, the Aero Club and the Aeronautical Institute, the for-
mer having been established for the encouragement of ballooning (and
possibly flying) as a sport, while the latter aims at interesting the
working classes in the subject.

I may here seize the opportunity of explaining to our visitors and
others the objects of our society, and why it is that we make so much
of a study which to them may seem somewhat chimerical and of no
RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS. 15

very special merit, and by explaining these I hope to enlist their sym-
pathy and support to the moyement. For I have before now been
asked: ** Why should it*be necessary to have a society for the study of
aerial navigation? Where is the importance of it? Why not institute
a society for submarine navigation, for wireless telegraphy, or for the
encouragement of any other novel invention for the improvement of
means of communication or warfare?” But useful as many such
inventions may be, none can have the great importance which may
some day be attached to the machine which navigates the air.

And there are two reasons why this subject is a large one. The first
is that the science of aeronautics is one combining many branches and
spreads into many ramifications. We have aerial machines as they
exist to-day. The balloon, forming a unique and fascinating mode
of travel, enables us to mount high into the skies to obtain glorious
views of earth and cloudscape, giving us a laboratory for the study of
many intricate problems of the atmosphere, and forming a valuable
instrument of war. We must study how this passive buoy may be
improved upon, what new materials may be applied to its construction,
gases, methods for causing it to rise and sink, and means of directing
it out of the course of the wind. But we also have the more difficult
problem of how to drive it through the air so as to make it inde-
pendent of the wind and go in any desired direction. Closely con-
nected with this is is the subjeet of kite flying, whether for man lifting
or meteorological observation, of parachutes, and of soaring machines.
All these necessitate a certain knowledge of the various branches of
meteorology, which is to aeronautics as hydrogaphy is to marine nav-
igation. Then we have the study of birds and other flying animals as
a natural sequel to the science.

The second reason for the importance of this subject is the vast
future which appears open to it. If such an apparatus can be con-
structed as will enable man to make practical use of the highway of
the air, there is promise of the subject becoming of even more impor-
tance than marine navigation or railways.

We have, then, not merely to consider the broad principles of the
general form of the aerial machine of the future —whether it is to take
the shape of an artificial bird, a propelled kite, or a dirigible balloon.
We have to study the subject of aerodynamics, the effect of air pres-
sures on plane or curved surfaces traveling at various speeds and at
various angles of incidence. We have to investigate the efficiency of
aerial propellers of different forms, the strengths of materials, the
energy and weights of various forms of motors. Then we must also
study the natural currents of air, the variability of air strata, the
trends of winds, and so on.

The great range of subjects to be gone into by our society is thus
patent. Many of our members and others are busily at work in some
124 RECENT AERONAUTICAL PROGRESS.

particular groove, making steady progress in building up their portion
of the foundation of that great structure which we all hope to see rise
up in the future.

But to return to the question of the recent progress in aerial nayi-
gation, I will now endeavor to point out and explain the present posi-
tion we hold, and by considering the state of the subject as it at
present exists to judge whether or not there is any real probability of
our attaining that great goal which most of us look forward to.

Though it is improbable there are many here present to-night who
do not look forward with feelings of confidence that artificial flight
will some day be accomplished, yet there are still some few skeptics
(most, if not all, of whom have never looked deeply into the subject)
who believe it impossible. For this reason it may not perhaps be out
of place in such an address as this to point out our reasons for main-
taining this belief.

The first great argument in favor of it is that birds fly. If we had
never seen such a thing as a bird, many of us might reasonably argue
the thing to be impossible. But there they are. Not only can they
rise in the air, not only progress at a very rapid rate through it, but
they can continue the movement for long periods and in almost any
weather. It is quite certain now that birds do not possess any very
extraordinary power; but if they did we could probably **go one
better” with the modern very compact and light oil engines. We have
now compressed the strength of a horse into a little motor weighing
no more than a large bird. There is the power. Can it be applied?
Many people have argued that the flight of a bird is dependent on
some valvular action of its feathers. Let it be so; but how do you
account for the flight of the bat and of the flying fox? Others have
thought that flight is only possible up to a certain weight, maintaining
that the ostrich and the emuare beyond that limit. But geologists
will point you out the fossil remains of a huge reptile which they
declare flew in the air and weighed far more.

3ut, leaving nature, we may consider what has been done by man to
justify our hopes.

Though I believe it may be said that nearly all the authorities on
the subject are now of opinion that the balloon can not be considered
as much more than an aid—to act as a stepping stone—to true flight,
yet there are many workers who consider that very much may be
accomplished by propelled balloons. Some authorities have calculated
that a speed of 44 miles an hour might be practically attained, but not
more,

M. Santos Dumont and others have shown us what can be done with
a little cigar-shaped balloon. They have clearly demonstrated the
difficulties to be overcome. It is very palpable that the surface of
such a balloon must be stiff and rigid. Once it gets flabby it can not
