Frontispiece: During the past twenty years under Secretary Ripley’s guidance,
the Smithsonian has been dedicated to reaching out to the public at large. At
the same time, the boundaries of museum activities have been extended beyond
the monumental buildings to the Mall and other spaces outside. Exemplifying
this spirit, the photos on the preceding pages show (left) one of the posters at
Washington bus stops that promoted a major exhibition at the Freer Gallery
celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of James McNeill Whistler and

was installed in the outdoor amphitheater near the west end of the National
Museum of American History during the early summer of 1984.

The Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846 in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson
of England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United
States of America “to found at Washington, under the name of
the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property
and accepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in
an “establishment,” whose statutory members are the President,
the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust
in the Smithsonian Board of Regents.

ROBERT McC. ADAMS

Institutionally, the Smithsonian is unique. Its stockholders, to
stretch the term but slightly, are the people of the United States.
This Smithsonian Year is a report to the people on the achieve-
ments and problems of fiscal year 1984.

I had the great honor of becoming the Smithsonian’s ninth Sec-
retary a mere thirteen days before the end of that year. This, then,
can only be a letter of transmittal. Appropriately, the traditional
Statement of the Secretary introducing this report is penned by
the distinguished scientist, educator, and administrator who led
the Smithsonian not only through all but a few days of fiscal year
1984 but also through two momentous decades before that.

It was a period of rich development and meaningful growth.
Under Dillon Ripley’s guidance, the Institution was able to open
doors and windows, both literally and figuratively. The doors of
a string of new museums were thrown open; windows to the minds
of millions were opened through a range of imaginative exhibi-
tions, programs, and publications. Research blossomed, and results
in scholarship were impressive.

The years ahead will be years of challenge in a changing world,
a changing economy, changing educational and cultural priorities.
I am confident that the Institution, building upon the Ripley heri-
tage, will continue to be faithful to its mandate to increase and
diffuse knowledge for the benefit of humankind.
Time Present and Time Past Are Wrapped in
Time Future

SDIELON. RIPLEY

“Gentlemen [and Ladies]: I have the honor to submit a report
showing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches... .” Thus, in the manner of the first seven
Secretaries, I greeted the Regents in 1964. Having served rhetorical
formality, I am honored to begin my final report. There is certain
comfort in tradition, after all, an accustomed fit like an old tweed
coat against the drafts of new circumstance. Tugging precedent
around my shoulders, I recall that my immediate predecessor,
Leonard Carmichael, reported on his first ten years en bloc. So I
am pleased to follow his worthy example and review the past score
years, as long a term as anyone save our paradigm, Joseph Henry,
was privileged to serve. It is a pleasure here to hand on the Smith-
sonian torch to the excellent successor to us all, Robert McCormick
Adams.

Looking backward—a proven way to take one’s bearings in the
woods or when putting out to sea—I am astonished to observe
how far we have come since 1964, a landmark year on many fronts.
In January, Dr. Carmichael had paved the way for the opening of
the Museum of History and Technology, ably assisted by Frank
Taylor, that museum’s first director; a national cultural center pro-
posed by President Eisenhower was renamed for John F. Kennedy
and placed under the Smithsonian aegis; some 10 million visitors
entered our buildings on the Mall; three cubs were born to Mohini,
the white tiger at the National Zoo; 1.2 million specimens were
acquired, some six hundred of them donated by the still-active
sixth Secretary, Alexander Wetmore. Also in that year, no doubt
emboldened by my relative youth, I expounded the following
thought: “Museums and their related laboratories are just entering
a new era, and museum resources are being drawn upon as never
before for general education.” [Emphasis belated.]

Twenty years later, I relish the memory of what was in the
air—an electric and electrifying energy like a summer storm over

the great plain of the then empty Mall. It boded so well in many
respects: the promise of enriching activity, like warm rain to
nourish the crop of human potential. President Kennedy’s clarion
call to a New Frontier still echoed noble challenges as the Peace
Corps reached its stride, and the Great Society agenda was gather-
ing force. The new National Council on the Arts was conceiving
the Arts and Humanities Endowments that would grow mightily
during President Nixon’s administration. America was “busting out
all over” in 1964, not only at the Smithsonian but everywhere. It
is fitting to remember that all the energy was not wisely spent;
that a well-intentioned nation blundered into the Vietnam mis-
adventure. The nation and its leaders were not faultless in that
highly charged decade (or any other), but the common failings
then were neither timidity nor conformity. Even around the Smith-
sonian—especially here, I believe—one sensed a kind of estival
energy.

Perhaps one had to have been here in the dead of institutional
winter to appreciate it. Again “look backward lest we fail to mark
the path ahead.” Early in the Second World War, I had passed
through the Museum of Natural History and found it as stifling
as my wartime destination in the Southeast Asian forest. The ad-
ministrator of the museum was unaffectionately known as the
“Abominable No-man” for his unwavering diligence in barring the
door against innovation, while the curatorial staff was preoccupied
with housekeeping and the conduct of bureaucracy. Yet by 1964,
a new generation of curators was emerging. Perhaps they repre-
sented a phylogenetic leap or, more likely, were boosted by the
winds of productive adventure blowing across the land.

Raising our sights two decades ago, we surveyed the world of
science, history, and art from the Castle and realized our discov-
ered goals were not so much new ambitions as renewed intentions
to realize the Institution’s ancient promise. We found one challenge
in Secretary Henry’s aim to make the Smithsonian a center for
“enlarging the bounds of human thought”; another in his boast
that “we have from the first kept a keen eye on every discovery
of science and every invention in art”; a third in his vision for a
“College of Discoverers.”” Nor could we forget the mighty mandate
of the legator himself “to found in Washington an Institution for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”

First among my aims was the basically democratic one to make
the Smithsonian known to its owners, the American people and by
extension all humankind. The public had come to view the Smith-

Statement by the Secretary / 7

sonian as a dusty vitrine containing insects impaled on little pins,
their names penned in a language as dead as the halls’ appeal. We
wanted to invite people in, to make them welcome, to accomplish
the museum’s principal work of attracting men, women, and chil-
dren to exhibits and activities that stimulate the soul and the
intellect.

Second, if the Smithsonian were to claim its rightful place among
learned societies, the deprivations of its own staff must end. It
behooved us to appreciate the men and women who in some
instances labored in Dickensian gloom, and behooved us specifically
to create both an atmosphere in which they might thrive and an
outlook that would attract gifted successors.

Third, a fair reading of the founder’s will and a quick study of
the Institution’s history showed substantial gaps in the curriculum.
Both the original mandate and the precedents of practice encour-
aged us to find or create ways to fill those gaps, as for example in
art, environmental science, and aeronautica.

Finally, it was incumbent on America’s preeminently national
museum complex to take its place as a leader both in this country
and abroad.

Not surprisingly, these interrelated goals answered problems that
were connected. Over time an original premise of the place had
turned topsy turvy: privately supported by a single bequest, the
Institution had received from Congress a tiny sum in 1855 to pay
for tending some miscellaneous collections, but now that stipend
had mushroomed until the government provided 90 percent of the
budget. No wonder the public didn’t see the Smithsonian as their
own; it belonged to the Feds. If people came to know the Smith-
sonian better, we reasoned, not only would they profit personally
and intellectually but they might come to support it more. In time,
then, we might restore an organization supported equally by pri-
vate persons and the government.

There is a footnote to history, perhaps, in a memo written to
me in 1981 by our then treasurer, Chris Hohenlohe: “In reviewing
some historical material on Smithsonian budgets, I discovered the
interesting fact that the operating budget for the current fiscal
year, 1980—just under $200 million—is equivalent to the total of
all operating expenditures of the Smithsonian for the years 1847
through 1963. Put another way, you will be overseeing a budget
in this year alone which equals all of the moneys spent by your
seven predecessors. Since your incumbency, you have already been
responsible for overseeing 87 percent of all of the Smithsonian’s

operating expenses since 1847... .’

Personnel problems were also linked to the dependency on fed-
eral appropriations. For reasons lost in the ossuaries of history,
every Smithsonian employee was a federal worker first and a
scholar, scientist, or technician second. The terms of employment
did not necessarily address the career concerns of scholar or scien-
tist. It was clear that we had to find ways to compete with univer-
sities and other research institutions, to offer not only laboratory
space, but staff assistance, publishing opportunity, and higher
salaries which perforce must be funded from new private endow-
ments. As a virtual ward of the government, the Institution might
eschew individual enterprise and intellectual initiative. It behooved
us to encourage our people in the unfettered pursuit of profes-
sional interests.

Looking back over these twenty years is like studying a great
tapestry in the Textiles Collection, a complex of many threads. In
that first fiscal year the Smithsonian bravely opened several new
offices to embark on overdue work in various directions. We estab-
lished an Office of Education and Training, then an Office of
International Activities which William W. Warner directed with
peripatetic éclat. It organized the first archaeological dig abroad
with State Department cooperation. It helped unesco rescue Abu
Simbel and the monuments of Nubia from the rising waters of
Lake Nasser. It facilitated American scientists of all disciplines and
affiliations to work abroad by making local currencies available
to them as “counterpart funds.” If it appeared that the Institution
was embarked on an “outreach” campaign that year, the stage was
being set for other drama through such activities as the first con-
versations with Joseph H. Hirshhorn.

Studying what had come before offered a splendid springboard,
for a review of Smithson’s legacy revealed that 1965 was the bi-
centennial of the founder’s birth. What better occasion to win
academe and public alike to our renascent cause and, mirabile dictu,
rededicate his namesake Institution. The convocation celebrating
James Smithson’s 200th birthday brought the pomp and panoply
of a full-dress academic procession to the Mall as we conferred
the first Smithson Medal on the Royal Society (of which our
founder had been a member at age twenty-four). Some five hun-
dred learned societies around the globe sent their representatives
in recognition of the Smithsonian’s contributions to learning since
1846. These harkened back to the free exchange of scientific infor-
mation and research under the first Secretary.

of Natural History for the formal opening of the Institution’s eighth interna-
tional symposium, “The Road after 1984: High Technology and Human Free-
dom,” on December 8, 1983.
Fiscal year 1965 also saw the creation of the Resident Associate
Program, which proved the Biblical lesson of manifold returns:
“Give, and it shall be given unto you.” Some subscribers thought
the program an act of overt generosity on our part, yet it has
earned more than it cost many times over. For one thing, it pro-
vided a new way for the Institution to do its important work by
offering a new vehicle to diffuse knowledge. For another, it brought
into the Smithsonian fold a whole new constituency of friends who
would be both self-motivated seekers and our ambassadors. This
and subsequent Associates programs brought us close to people
and them to us. Resembling programs suggested by Secretary
Walcott in 1926, they provided educational and recreation oppor-
tunities for people who soon supported the Institution with their
gifts and good offices.

On the several scientific fronts: Donald Davis proved through
the intriguing agency of moths that yucca and agave plants belong
to one genus; through faunal evidence J. F. Gates Clarke demon-
strated the then surprising hypothesis of continental drift: that
Australia, New Zealand, Rapa Island, and South Africa were once
joined. Pioneering volunteer observers joined the Prairie Network
to track satellites and meteorites across the night skies; the new
publications series Contributions to Anthropology was launched;
we were given an estuarine tract, the Chesapeake Bay Center for
Environmental Studies, now a 2500-acre natural workshop and
laboratory; the Flight Cage at the National Zoo opened to the
delight of visitors and avian occupants alike.

On strategic fronts, the Regents authorized the start of sub-
stantive conversations both with Mr. Hirshhorn and with the
trustees of New York’s beleaguered art museum at the Cooper
Union Institute. Sires, the traveling exhibition service, was reac-
tivated. Mary Livingston Ripley helped organize the soon highly
effective Women’s Committee, while her husband contemplated
the sorry tradition that the Secretary was the only Smithsonian
figure listed in the social directory, the Green Book. This was a
fact that had nothing to do with any scholarly issue or museum
policy; but it had everything to do with Washington’s infrastruc-
ture, with money and access to eleemosynary support anywhere.
As surely as an expedition in Nepal needs caches of food, success
in any Washington venture requires access to the seats of influ-
ence, a fact of life that may have been neglected by previous
Secretaries who did not believe their duties included fundraising.
Meanwhile, mindful of Joseph Henry’s belief that the Mall might

12 / Smithsonian Year 1984
be made one of the most delightful places in the United States, we
began turning this greensward into a park for people, a lawn of
living celebrations, as trumpeters mounted the Castle’s North
Portico and the National Symphony performed on the terrace of
the new Museum of History and Technology.

In the banner year of 1966, beetles arrived from the tomb of
Tutankhamen; the Arts and Industries Building was renovated;
Nathan Reingold began editing The Papers of Joseph Henry, a
project jointly sponsored by the Smithsonian, the American Phil-
osophical Society, and the National Academy of Sciences; the Divi-
sion of Performing Arts made its debut; the Smithsonian Institu-
tion Press began publishing, with some trade books in addition to
a scholarly and scientific list.

Above all, President Johnson proved himself a friend of art and
of the Smithsonian. First, he was instrumental in saving the original
Corcoran art gallery building from demolition. This architectural
gem next to Blair House was transferred to the Smithsonian for
restoration as the Renwick Gallery. Next, the President and Mrs.
Johnson personally interceded in the cause of the Joseph H. Hirsh-
horn Museum and Sculpture Garden. I had solicited the Johnsons’
help in this matter, believing that they appreciated the ineffable
value of great art to the American people in general and Washing-
ton in particular. It seemed unfortunate that Washington might
lose this opportunity because of the presumption that nothing more
on the Mall could have a donor’s name on it. A truly passionate
collector of modern art, Hirshhorn owned nearly seven thousand
objects then valued at over $24 million, and he wanted to give the
lot—within an edifice he would help build—to America. There
was stiff competition between cities, nay among nations, to possess
this collection, but the President’s personal interest and interven-
tion won it for us. The gift of this treasury was one of three signal
art events in Washington’s history, in the grand tradition of
Charles Lang Freer’s contribution of his unrivaled orientalia and
Andrew W. Mellon’s donation of the National Gallery of Art.

Finally, 1966 marked the first of an annual miniconvocation of
scholars, academic specialists, artists, musicians, critics, and scien-
tists in cognate fields assembled as the Smithsonian Council. The
purpose of the three-day meetings of this council is mutual ex-
change: the Council familiarizes itself with the scholarly diversity
of our Institution, while our colleagues are exposed to kindred
souls in all fields. Each group comes to understand the other and
in the telling we are able to disseminate our wares to the intellec-

tual world about. The experience has not always “worked,” but
the annual meetings serve as a fascinating inward look and out-
ward exposure for both sides.

The following year marked the bestowal upon the Smithsonian
of the Lilly Collection of rare coins. Work began on the revised
multivolume Handbook of North American Indians and the Urgent
Anthropology Program. The year 1967 also brought new vitality
to “people programs.” Alarmed by the consensus among authori-
ties at an Aspen conference that museums belonged to gentry,
Charles Blitzer and I countered with a novel proposal: If less ele-
gant people tacitly proved the brahmins correct by staying away
from marble halls on the Mall, the Loop, and Fifth Avenue, then
let us build smaller museums in lesser neighborhoods. In Washing-
ton’s inner city we found an abandoned movie theater, a willing
community, and an administrator who was a local resident and
knew the area and its people well. Then John R. Kinard opened
the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and its doors are still open,
on the avenue later named for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Department of Transportation was also born in 1967, and
the Smithsonian took due notice. A vehicular extravaganza on the
Mall (which already boasted the roundabout jitney of the carousel)
featured a rally of antique cars, an exhibit of vehicles of the future,
and even a demonstration of real levitation as a ‘test pilot’”” bound-
ed around wearing a rocket belt. But in the most splendid event
on our lawns that year, the first Festival of American Folklife,
under the far-seeing direction of Ralph Rinzler, our expert in
ethnicity and folkcrafts, celebrated the manifold creativity of the
American people.

In 1968, the Office of Museum Programs opened and, reflecting
the spirit of the National Museum Act of 1966, provided an
array of advisory and assistance programs to kindred institutions
throughout the land. It also would serve as our conduit of news
about goings on elsewhere in America and abroad. New York’s
Cooper Union Museum was reborn as a Smithsonian bureau, the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, signif-
icantly our only museum outside Washington, D.C.

In Washington the fabled Patent Office Building became another
of the Smithsonian’s many mansions, this one to house both the
National Portrait Gallery and the National Collection of Fine Arts.
Here nomenclature presented conundrums fit for a taxonomist.
Since 1910 the Smithsonian had a “National Gallery of Art’ of
sorts, but Andrew Mellon had appropriated the generic name with

Statement by the Secretary / 15
his famous gift in 1938. The Smithsonian’s art holdings then ac-
quired the title of National Collection of Fine Arts, a rather grandi-
ose handle for the eclectic, interesting, yet fragmentary group of
objets that dustily reposed in Hall 10 of the Natural History Mu-
seum. It was this material that became the nucleus of the Patent
Office’s north side, which was later renamed most descriptively
the National Museum of American Art.

As for the National Portrait Gallery, this was no mere copy of
a British model, but thanks to its first two directors, Charles Nagel
and Marvin Sadik, a uniquely original museum: a source of visual
information about famous Americans.

In 1968, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars
was chartered by Congress as a Smithsonian bureau (under an
independent board of trustees, like the Kennedy Center and the
National Gallery of Art). In the same year the Smithsonian Astro-
physical Observatory, a joint venture with Harvard University,
opened its largest field facility, later named the Fred Lawrence
Whipple Observatory, atop Mount Hopkins in Arizona. As the
decade drew to a close, we looked farther and farther ahead.
Ground was broken for the Hirshhorn Museum, and plans were
laid for a national magazine to report on everything that interested
the Smithsonian “or should interest it,” as founding editor Edward
K. Thompson put it.

As the new decade began, we received approval to build the
National Air and Space Museum by a stroke of fiduciary genius
that might stand every government agency in good stead today.
Congress had authorized the expenditure of some $40 million for
the new museum, and we had commissioned a fine design. But with
costs skyrocketing, the construction bids were coming in at $65
million and up. Representative Michael Kirwan, a former Regent
and faithful friend on Capitol Hill, warned of disaster if we re-
quested more money. Instead, we informed our architect, Gyo
Obata, of our dilemma, told him that there was no alternative to
a streamlined, stripped-down design. At the same time, we per-
suaded a new President, Mr. Nixon, the Budget Office, and Con-
gress that if there was to be a National Air and Space Museum
in Washington on July 4, 1976, we must act quickly and push our
design and budget through. For this we summoned a blue ribbon
team: two Regents, William Burden and James Webb, and the
charismatic figure of Michael Collins fresh from the first moon
voyage. This astronaut pleaded our cause as the Director-elect of
the world’s most popular museum of the future. Meanwhile, the

ground-based astronomy, the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hop-

10-meter-diameter gamma-ray collector and 1.5-meter and 61-centimeter optical
reflectors (at lower left), and support and maintenance facilities are located on
a mile-long ridge at the 7,600-foot level. The Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint
facility with the University of Arizona, is located on the 8,500-foot summit.

Natural History Museum purchased a device of then novel design
and priceless worth for its investigations of previously unperceiv-
able minutiae, our first scanning electron microscope. The Institu-
tion also abetted the exploration of ephemera by supporting a new
branch in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Center for Short-Lived
Phenomena.

The troubled 1970s saw new and diverse activity on and around
the Mall. For one thing, the Kennedy Center opened. For another,
citizens returned en masse to Washington to protest the tragic war
in Vietnam. Here we were able to serve in a manner unexpected
for repositories of fossils and art. When tear gas lacrimated the
city, more than 80,000 people found fresh air in the environ-
mentally contained Museum of History and Technology.

In another sort of departure from inhumane policies, we annulled
the rule requiring our researchers to present their papers for pre-
publication review. And under the aegis of Charles Blitzer and
David Challinor, the tasks of heading scholarly and scientific de-
partments were put on a rotating basis—no more permanent
chairmen—in hope of precluding the investiture of a bureaucratic
satrapy.

In 1970, the Archives of American Art, an invaluable repository
of the personal history and maturation of America’s artists, be-
came a Smithsonian bureau. Also, hospitality services for the
Institution were expanded through the Visitors Information and
Associates’ Reception Center, which now directs a corps of volun-
teers approximately as large as the Smithsonian’s staff. V1arc
opened in conjunction with the premiere issue of Smithsonian
magazine, whose subscribers were automatically National Asso-
ciates. The magazine won Regents’ approval just after Earl Warren
stepped down as Chief Justice and ex officio Chancellor of the
Institution. Although many members of the Smithsonian commu-
nity opposed our entering the hue-and-cry world of popular jour-
nalism (as a few diehards still do), and grumblings about media
grants were growing louder in many quarters, our newly appointed
Chancellor, Chief Justice Warren Burger, led the Regents in ap-
proving the magazine. Within two years, the magazine began
showing a profit and has added handsomely to trust fund accounts
over the years. It has also won kudos from both media experts
and the public, who now subscribe as Associates in numbers ex-
ceeding two million.

In July 1970, the Smithsonian was privileged to enter the lime-
light on Capitol Hill when Representative Frank Thompson chaired

18 / Smithsonian Year 1984
a committee that reviewed our operations, policies, and finances.
While some bureau directors anticipated the hearings with dread,
I welcomed this expression of congressional interest in the Smith-
sonian, the first since 1855. We were fortunate that these overseers
corrected an ill-advised plan: the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp-
ture Garden would not transect the Mall. Beyond that, the com-
mittee concluded that “the Smithsonian’s value is basic and should
be continued. Its work and research in science, education, history
and the arts and, of course, its many museums far overshadow
whatever criticisms . . . have been made.” Further afield, the Fort
Pierce Bureau in Link Port, Florida, began operations as a Smith-
sonian marine station.

In 1972, President Nixon returned from his historic visit to the
world’s most populous nation with a gift of two giant pandas from
the people of China. They were ensconced at the National Zoo,
which also prepared to embark on director Theodore H. Reed’s
masterful master plan. The Renwick Gallery opened at last, and at
Treasury Secretary John B. Connally’s invitation, the Group of
Ten international finance ministers convened in the Castle. (It is
alleged that during that meeting the dollar floated as a result of
two of the finance ministers’ getting stuck together in a balky
elevator.)

The following year, the Regents approved the introduction in
Congress of legislation authorizing planning for a Museum Sup-
port Center on federally owned land in Silver Hill, Maryland.
Having outgrown our buildings on the Mall and elsewhere, the
several museums could now responsibly plan for the curation,
preservation, and storage of priceless collections in what would be
a state-of-the-art facility. But as we focused on new beginnings,
two of the three former Secretaries died in 1973, and thus ended
an actuarial miracle: until the demise of Leonard Carmichael and
of Charles Greely Abbot, half of the eight men who had chaired
this Institution since 1846 were still alive. (The first four died in
office.)

In the Mall’s landmark event for 1974, the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden opened at last, and to lasting acclaim as a
repository of modern art. The following year the General Services
Administration conferred on us an erstwhile experimental farm
and army remount station in Front Royal, Virginia, which the Zoo
put to use as a center for breeding, research, and conservation of
rare animals. But 1975 was almost as notable for what did not
occur. In three signal instances the Smithsonian proved that it no

nation’s attic,” repository of things wanted nowhere else, may be
shelved, perhaps in someone else’s garage. We declined acquisition
of the San Francisco Mint, of the Saint Louis Post Office, and of
the liner SS United States. We have also raised a few eyebrows by
turning down Howard Hughes’s plane, the Spruce Goose.

The nation’s Bicentennial witnessed celebrations almost every-
where, but the year 1976 was an especial one on the Mall where
our museums mounted twenty-three special exhibitions, a grand
pastiche collectively called “The American Experience.” At the
suggestion of Frank Taylor, director general of the U.S. National
Museum, this included the reopening of the Arts and Industries
Building with a recreation of the 1876 Centennial Exposition at
Philadelphia. In the Natural History Building the West Court had
been developed to house a cafeteria, gift shop, and Naturalist
Center. In New York, the refurbished and reorganized Cooper-
Hewitt Museum under the consummate direction of Lisa Taylor
opened in Andrew Carnegie’s mansion on Fifth Avenue. But the
signal premiere was on the Mall’s south side: the July first open-
ing of the National Air and Space Museum, which set some kind
of record by welcoming two million visitors in the first forty-nine
days.

In the following years, the Smithsonian Institution Press added
a new imprint, now known as Smithsonian Books, another pub-
lishing venture of merit for the public and revenue for the Institu-
tion. The Regents opened a special fund for Institution acquisitions,
special research, and education. The Office of Biological Conser-
vation became our coordinator and watchdog in the crucial realm
of conservation activities. The Assistant Secretary for Public Ser-
vice, Julian Euell, established the Office of Telecommunications
under the able direction of Chic Cherkezian, thereby adding to the
Institution’s outreach efforts the powerful aid of electronic media.

The decade’s last year saw several major new projects. For one,
the fifteen-year-old independent Museum of African Art, so far
as we know the only American museum of its ken, became a new
Smithsonian bureau. In the Southwest, the Multiple Mirror Tele-
scope, a joint venture with the University of Arizona at Mount
Hopkins, began scanning the skies with uniquely new acuity. In
the Canal Zone, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute estab-
lished a 13,000-acre biological preserve, the Barro Colorado Na-
ture Monument. At home, the Regents established a new fellow-
ship program for attracting eminent scholars and scientists in

residence.

In 1980, Walter Adey’s living coral reef—the first ever main-
tained apart from the sea—was put on public display at the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History. The National Portrait Gallery
acquired Gilbert Stuart’s most famous portraits, perhaps the truest
likenesses of George and Martha Washington, in a special partner-
ship with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The following year,
the specially designed Thomas M. Evans Gallery opened at Na-
tural History as a showcase for traveling exhibitions. This was
soon followed by the establishment of the James E. Webb Fellow-
ships to promote excellence in the management of cultural and
scientific nonprofit institutions, and by two projects of first-magni-
tude importance to museology. First, in 1983 the Museum Support
Center was finally opened at Silver Hill, the world’s model facility,
we hope, for the maintenance of museum collections. Second, the
first stage of an institution-wide inventory was completed: the
painstaking task of identifying and counting all of the Smith-
sonian’s 100,000,000 artifacts and specimens. The results of this
“sreat counting” will include cybernetic access to data describing
every single one of our possessions.

The last years of my administration have seen the National Air
and Space Museum begin the project of placing its collection of
over one million photographs onto laser videodisc. Also during
this period, several Smithsonian museums jointly compiled a poly-
math exhibition, Treasures of the Smithsonian Institution, for dis-
play at the celebrated Edinburgh Arts Festival. It was August 1984,
two hundred years to the month from James Smithson’s introduc-
tion to the Highlands and the Age of Enlightenment.

Finally in 1983, there was the planning, authorization, and early-
stage construction of the Smithsonian Center for African, Near
Eastern, and Asian Cultures. This largely underground facility,
initially endowed by Arthur M. Sackler to contain his priceless
collection of Asian masterworks, will connect with the Freer, and
will comprise also the fabled collections of the Museum of African
Art. Like the youngest child of a parent, this new museum com-
plex—the Quadrangle—must always have a special place in my
heart.

The money for it has been raised and committed; funds for the
structure’s programs have already been pledged by a goodly num-
ber of the governments and individuals across the vast arc of
mostly new nations of that half of the world represented in the
Center’s title. My chief regret at relinquishing the torch now is
leaving before the Quadrangle’s completion. But like the Smith-

22 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Brian Fisher, a thirteen-year-old junior high school student from Chicago, be-
came the 75 millionth visitor to the National Air and Space Museum on May
24, 1984. He is greeted by museum director Walter Boyne. In the background,
three medieval-costumed trumpeters herald the occasion.

sonian itself, this building may never be finished save in a physical
sense. Its purpose, its inner life as manifested in scholarly pro-
grams and public appreciation of exhibits, will depend on those
who follow me and my generation of curators, scientists, historians,
and delineators of knowledge.

The new Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures
rises steadily (as I write) in its vast pit, looking in embryo like
the beginnings of a coral reef in a tropical lagoon. The shelflike
ledges appear in place and will superimpose themselves layer by
layer. A delicate miniature forest of lacy pillars spreads up from
the base like the skeletal frame of sea fans or the bare branches of
gorgonians thrusting toward the light.

Soon this solid foundation will all be filled in and a verdant
green carpet will spread out like the top of the reef at low tide.
Look for water splashing here and there, with two projecting gal-
leries above, beautiful stranded granite boulders rich in color, set
amongst the vegetation, a dream come true.

Perhaps in years to come a similar Center for the New World
can arise in the quadrilateral space east of the Air and Space
Museum which was deeded to us some time ago by the Congress.
The statute specified that plans for any structure on that last Mall
building site must be approved in advance by Congress. (No one
need be taken unawares by some vast teeth of Cadmus springing
up overnight to obstruct the western vista from the Capitol towards
the panorama of Mall and monuments.) This was a wise decision,
one in which the Smithsonian concurred, testifying that we had
no wish to encumber space with sheer manmade mass to obliterate
openness, an increasingly precious commodity in our city.

If the Quadrangle becomes the success we anticipate—novel in
theme as well as structure—what a fine example it can serve for
the future in our world. It will serve as a model for still another
vast cultural history to be told and pondered: the sweep of two
continents from the Bering Sea to Cape Horn trodden by the
streams of emerging civilizations over the course of some 30,000
years. Cultures have emerged in the flowing over these new worlds,
from north to south, from west to east. No similar event can quite
so clearly be defined on the rest of the planet; no effort has so far
been attempted to describe in time and sequence this all-encom-
passing tidal flow which continues even today in a way whose his-
tory is only becoming known and whose future like the winds of
time cannot be discerned.

For the present our new Center for African, Middle Eastern, and

24 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Asian Cultures is an experiment for the Institution, delving into
cultural history in a new mode. J am intrigued to speculate on the
pedestrian traffic this Center will bring, whether it will attract new
thoughts, new ways of understanding half of the world’s popula-
tion. As the winds change so may our perceptions also of our
fellow humans. Across the Mall, even on calm days, gusts and
eddies of breeze remind one that this is a vast, still, quite open
space. The wind, when it comes unpredictably, blows hither and
yon. Sometimes the flags round the Washington Monument stand
straight out, their whipping sound rising to a continuous muted
roar like rapids in a stream in spate.

Pandit Nehru once said, unforgettably, “Strange winds are blow-
ing across the face of Asia. We know not whence they come nor
where they go.” His prescient words evoked a thrilling current
within me like some music. Walking across the Mall one senses
such electricity in the air, and visions of a kind, whether past or
future, we cannot tell.

Beneath the ambient noises of everyday, the ephemera of today’s
news or tomorrow’s politics, there is a steady mass of public
opinions and notions, indeed convictions, which like the breezes
are independent of the noisemakers. In the turmoil and drama of
communication most people do not listen, and do not hear or sense
the presence of these notions. No opinion poll seems to be effective,
either. What then could we hear if we cared enough?

It seems that Eisenhower’s farewell words were prescient also,
often quoted but, like Cassandra’s, unheeded. ‘Beware the military-
industrial complex.” It is not so much the question of the triumphs
of technology. One cannot feel really alarmed by our nation’s
hegemony of military-industrial development. It moves anyway,
ponderously, imperceptibly even, irrespective of the overt shouting
and tumult.

What the past years have wrought is a state of mind that seems
more pervasive and indeed alarming than the surface evidence.
Faith is at a nadir today. Religion has succumed to niggling com-
plaints about other faiths, and to a fratricidal theocracy, unknown
since the Middle Ages. We may decry the rise of militant Islamic
sectarianism, but it is being mirrored all across the world in varie-
ties of fanaticism unparalleled in recent time. In the name of re-
ligion, pseudo-religion, or neo-religion, technology aids us today
in constant acts of terror, blasphemy, and horror, enough to tip
the balance so as to defeat faith itself. We have turned inward,
towards inner self and thus selfishness with no restraint. Ambition

Among the major works of art received by the Smithsonian this
fiscal year were (above) Edgar Degas’ portrait of Mary Cassatt,

Chaim Herzog, president of Israel.

as of now is for oneself alone in every sense or sensibility. Mam-
mon is worshiped, a companion to envy and greed in the denial of
faith.

In this paroxysm of shock, there is a parallel settling down as
of an outward buffer towards a numbing new conservatism, a
search for conformity, the building of an overweening consensus.
If there is in truth only a consensus, then bureaucracy administered
by computer will be the answer to everything. There will be a
mood of pseudocomplacency covering an essential malaise of the
spirit in what may be observed. If possible, let it be routed out if
we are to succeed in the restoration of our real faith. The cur-
rent state is a presentiment of a failure in our culture. We must
assume that the ideals embodied in our history are capable of a
just and noble restoration, and perhaps this Institution is the one
to be the bellwether. Let us then summon those strange winds to
our cause and make the view of the Mall one of hope, of keening
winds blowing our flags straight and whipping shrill.

STAFF CHANGES

The Secretary’s Executive Committee was diminished by the loss
of three members in the last year. Paul Perrot, Assistant Secretary
for Museum Programs since 1972, became director of the Virginia
Museum of Fine Arts. Chris Hohenlohe, my erstwhile executive
assistant and, since 1979, the Institution’s valued Treasurer, left
in November to pursue private financial enterprises. (Ann Leven,
formerly of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Chase
Manhattan Bank, now serves as Chris’s successor.) Regrettably,
Larry Taylor, Coordinator of Public Information, retired.

Al Lerner has retired as founding director of the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden. He has been succeeded by James
Demetrion, who came from the Des Moines Art Center. Other new
Smithsonian executives include Conservation Analytical Labora-
tory director Lambertus van Zelst; Milo C. Beach, formerly of
Williams College, who will head the Sackler Gallery; and William
Moss, who left the John F. Kennedy Library to direct the Smith-
sonian Archives.

Within the Institution, Michael Robinson moved from the Smith-
sonian Tropical Research Institute to succeed Ted Reed as director
of the National Zoological Park. Bill Klein, former director of the
Radiation Biology Laboratory, became director of the Environ-

28 / Smithsonian Year 1984
mental Research Center, and senior folklorist Peter Seitel was pro-
moted to director of the Office of Folklife Programs.

To these and many other members of our dedicated staff, we
owe a great debt of gratitude. As I have said before, the Smith-
sonian is a community of talented and interested people on whom
rests the Institution’s vitality and greatness. I take pride in having
been associated with them all.

The Board of Regents

The first meeting of the Board of Regents was held on January 23,
1984. After the Chancellor welcomed the new Regent, Mr. Samuel
Johnson, the Executive Committee reported on its January 4 meet-
ing at which the Acting Treasurer, Mr. Jameson, described the size,
purposes, and procedures of the Institution’s current fund invest-
ments. The Audit and Review Committee also reported on its
meeting of October 18, 1983, in which the members discussed the
status of the General Post Office building and collections manage-
ment policies, and conducted overviews of Smithsonian radio pro-
grams and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Ser-
vice. The Personnel Committee reported that it had found no con-
flict of interest whatsoever in the financial interests statements of
the executive staff.

Mr. Jameson gave a final report on the fiscal year 1983 trust
and appropriated funds, discussed the status of fiscal year 1984
funds, and noted the allowance from the Office of Management
and Budget for fiscal year 1985 appropriated funds. The Invest-
ment Policy Committee had met on November 17, 1983, to review
investment performance and strategies of the three investment
managers and reported that the annualized returns continued to
exceed market averages. To diversify and participate in an addi-
tional sector of the market, the committee recommended and the
Regents agreed to invest $5 million of trust funds in a mutual
fund specializing in science and technology issues. The committee
also proposed and the Regents approved establishing a more
liberal total return income payout rate to be applied to new en-
dowment funds which the Secretary will determine to have high
current income needs. Mr. Jameson presented a revised and up-
dated Five-Year Prospectus, Fiscal Years 1985-89, which was ap-
proved by the Regents.

Secretary Ripley reported on the construction of the Quadrangle,
on the status of fundraising, and, with the Assistant Secretary for
Public Service, Mr. Rinzler, on the preliminary planning for the
International Center. In other proposed actions, the Regents recog-
nized Abram Lerner’s accomplishments as founding director of the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and named the balcony

30 / Smithsonian Year 1984
room in his honor, approved in principle the expansion plans for
the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, endorsed the preliminary planning
for a Smithsonian presence at the 1984 Edinburgh Festival, au-
thorized the Secretary to enter into agreements with the State of
Maryland to designate the Smithsonian Environmental Research
Center as a National Estuarine Sanctuary, and requested that the
congressional members of the Board of Regents introduce and
support legislation authorizing the nonreimbursable transfer of the
General Post Office building (along with appropriations for its
repair and renovation) and other legislation to authorize planning
and construction of science facilities for the National Air and
Space Museum, the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and the Whipple
Observatory. They also voted to appoint Messrs. Michael Son-
nenreich, John Al Friede, and Gustave Schindler and Mrs. Milton
F. Rosenthal to terms on the Commission of the National Museum
of African Art.

After Secretary Ripley discussed a variety of status reports, the
chairman of the Regents Search Committee, Dr. Bowen, described
the process of searching for Mr. Ripley’s successor, adding that in
all of this committee’s discussions and voluminous correspondence
a recurring theme was an appreciation of the Secretary for his
exceptional leadership of the Smithsonian over two decades. In
executive session Dr. Bowen presented the Search Committee’s
recommendation and the Regents elected Robert McCormick
Adams, Provost of the University of Chicago, as the ninth Secre-
tary. Following the meeting, Messrs. Bowen, Ripley, and Adams
met briefly with the heads of Smithsonian bureaus and offices in
the Great Hall and then, along with Mr. Humelsine, held a press
conference in the Under Secretary’s office.

The Regents’ Dinner was held on the preceding evening, Jan-
uary 22, in the National Museum of American History. After
dinner Mr. Ripley greeted the guests and awarded to Paul N.
Perrot, Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, the Secretary’s
Gold Medal for Exceptional Service.

The Chancellor called to order the second meeting of the year
in the Regents’ Room at 9:30 a.m., May 7, 1984. The Executive
Committee reported on its meeting of April 11 in which this com-
mittee, acting on behalf of the Regents, requested the congres-
sional Regents to promote legislation effecting the reappointment
of Regents Armstrong and Higginbotham for the statutory terms
of six years. The Audit and Review Committee discussed its meet-

Statement by the Secretary / 31
ing of March 8 in which they had an overview of the Archives of
American Art, discussed Coopers & Lybrand’s consolidated audit
of trust and federal funds for fiscal year 1983 and Report to Man-
agement, considered factors in the Institution’s construction priori-
ties, and received reports on the Office of Audits’ most significant
recommendations in 1983 and on improvements in Smithsonian
security programs. The Investment Policy Committee reported on
its review of the investment managers’ performance and the
Regents, acting on this committee’s recommendations, approved
fiscal year 1985 total return payout rates for the endowment funds.

Mr. Jameson presented a detailed report on the status of current
year funds and the processes of budgeting for fiscal years 1985
and 1986. After considerable discussion, the Regents voted to
authorize the Secretary to negotiate contracts for the financing,
construction, and operation of a new restaurant facility in the
National Air and Space Museum and for the financing, appro-
priate renovations, and operation of food services in other Smith-
sonian museums; to create a Special Exhibition Fund for under-
writing carefully selected, major, temporary exhibitions; to receive
the Annual Report, Smithsonian Year 1983; to appoint Barbara
Tuchman, Frank Stanton, and Robert McNeil to terms on the
Commission of the National Portrait Gallery, to appoint Helen
Neufeld and Colbert King to terms on the Commission of the
National Museum of African Art, and to appoint Donald Ander-
son, Walter Hancock, Bartlett H. Hayes, Jr., Eloise Spaeth,
Charles Parkhurst, Gene B. Davis, and Margaret Dodge Garrett
to terms on the Commission of the National Museum of American
Art; and to endorse the Smithsonian’s participation in the 1984
Edinburgh Festival and authorize the Secretary to draw upon un-
restricted trust funds for that purpose with the approval of the
Executive Committee.

Mr. Ripley reported on progress in the construction of the
Quadrangle, noted that prospects were excellent for meeting or
exceeding the original goal of raising $37.5 million in nonappro-
priated funds, and described the closing stages of the fundraising
campaign. He also presented a number of status reports on Smith-
sonian programs and activities.

On September 24, 1983, the National Board of Smithsonian
Associates unanimously recommended that two distinguished ben-
efactors of the Institution, Dr. Arthur M. Sackler and Mrs. Enid
A. Haupt, be the first inductees into the Order of James Smithson.
In recognition of their extraordinary contributions to the Smith-

32 / Smithsonian Year 1984
sonian, the Board of Regents heartily endorsed their induction
into the Order at a suitable occasion to be arranged by the
Secretary.

On Sunday evening, May 6, President and Mrs. Reagan were
hosts to the Regents, members of the Smithsonian Establishment,
and Secretary and Mrs. Ripley at a dinner in the Blue Room of
the White House. During the proceedings the President raised a
toast to Secretary and Mrs. Ripley and Mr. Ripley returned the
honor.

The Regents’ third meeting of the year was called to order by
the Chancellor on September 17, 1984. The Executive Committee
reported on its meeting of August 22 in which it reviewed and
approved the Regents’ agenda. Mr. Humelsine announced that in
a poll through the mail, the Regents voted unanimously to induct
Secretary Ripley into the Order of James Smithson and to present
to Mrs. Ripley the Joseph Henry Medal. The Audit and Review
Committee reported that on May 24, it conducted an overview of
the National Zoological Park and of the Institution’s product
licensing program. In addition the Audit and Review Committee
discussed Coopers & Lybrand’s plan for their consolidated audit of
fiscal year 1984 funds and the Smithsonian’s measures toward im-
proved food service operations and facilities. The Investment
Policy Committee also reported on the performance of the invest-
ment managers as of June 30.

In presenting the Financial Report, Mr. Jameson described the
status of current year federal and trust funds as well as the pend-
ing action of the Congress on the fiscal year 1985 appropriations.
After discussion the Regents approved the fiscal year 1985 budget
for nonappropriated funds and the submission of the fiscal year
1986 budget request to the Office of Management and Budget.
The Regents also gave preliminary thought to a draft of the Five-
Year Prospectus, Fiscal Years 1986-1990, which they will consider
for approval at their next meeting.

Among other actions the Regents endorsed the Smithsonian’s
participation in the Festival of India and authorized some contin-
gent expenses; approved discussions leading to a donation of col-
lections from the U.S. Patent Model Foundation; authorized nego-
tiations with the Tupper family for their support of construction
of a laboratory and conference facility, to be named for Earl S.
Tupper, at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; voted to
induct Mrs. Sara Roby into the Order of James Smithson in recog-
nition of her generous contribution of her fine collection of twen-

tieth-century realist masters to the National Museum of American
Art; and discussed the George Eastman House Board of Trustees’
suggestion that their photography collections be transferred to the
Smithsonian. Secretary Ripley presented a detailed report on the
construction, fundraising, and preliminary programming for the
Quadrangle and introduced a variety of other status reports.

In their final act in Secretary Ripley’s administration, the Re-
gents adopted the following resolution and ordered it to be laid
upon the record:

RESOLUTION

Whereas S. Dillon Ripley has served as Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution with great distinction for more than two
decades and has overseen its extraordinary development to
the benefit of the American people and the citizens of the
world;

Whereas Secretary Ripley has opened the halls of the Smith-
sonian for record-setting numbers of citizens to enjoy through
a vast array of stimulating exhibitions in the National Mu-
seums, through a greatly expanded traveling exhibition ser-
vice, and through both the printed and electronic media;

Whereas Secretary Ripley has added immeasurably to the Insti-
tution’s international stature in museum techniques for ex-
hibition and conservation, in studies of the physical and
natural sciences, history and art, and therefore in fostering
increased intercultural and international understanding; and

Whereas Secretary Ripley has continued to pursue significant
ornithological and ecological research enhancing the Smith-
sonian’s leadership in the conservation of nature:

Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,
That S. Dillon Ripley is named Secretary Emeritus so that he
may continue to be of service to the Board from time to time
and Research Associate so that he may continue his scholarly
investigations to the credit of the Institution, and to that end
it is agreed that he shall be provided appropriate staff support
and a grant for his research.

Having adjourned their formal meeting, the Regents joined the
Regents Emeriti, invited guests, and the staff and volunteers of the
Institution for a noontime ceremony on the Mall marking the in-

34 / Smithsonian Year 1984
stallation of Mr. Adams as the ninth Secretary. Following a prelude
of traditional and patriotic music from the U.S. Navy Ceremonial
Band, the Chancellor introduced Mr. Ripley who expressed his
gratitude for the support and pleasure he received from the Re-
gents, the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, the staff
and volunteers, and countless others. The Chancellor then pre-
sented a traditional brass key to Mr. Adams who delivered a brief
address on his view of Smithsonian purposes. There followed a
reception and luncheon in the Great Hall and Commons for the
Regents, Regents Emeriti, and invited guests.

On Sunday evening, September 16, the Chancellor and the Re-
gents held a formal dinner in the National Air and Space Museum
in honor of Secretary and Mrs. Ripley. As voted by the Board of
Regents and on their behalf, Mr. Humelsine inducted Mr. Ripley
into the Order of James Smithson and Mrs. Armstrong presented
the Joseph Henry Medal to Mrs. Ripley. The Vice-President gave
a toast to the Ripleys and announced that the Secretary will be
receiving the President’s Medal of Freedom. Concluding the cere-
monies pianist Bruce Steeg and two vocalists presented a selection
of musical favorites.

FINANCIAL REPORT

ANN R. LEVEN, TREASURER

Summary: Fiscal year 1984 marked a year of change at the Smith-
sonian, most notably the appointment of Robert McC. Adams as
the ninth Secretary of the Institution and the retirement of S.
Dillon Ripley as the eighth Secretary. Mr. Ripley’s extraordinary
legacy is nowhere more visible than in the Institution’s fiscal report.
In fiscal year 1965, Mr. Ripley’s first full year as Secretary, the
Institution’s operating budget was $30 million. For the year just
ended, Mr. Ripley presided over a greatly expanded Institution with
a budget tenfold that of fiscal year 1965.

Mr. Ripley’s twenty-year tenure, as referenced elsewhere in
Smithsonian Year, brought new vitality to the Institution, vitality
that cannot be measured in dollars. Mr. Ripley acted to shape the
form and focus of the Institution. New museums were added,
particularly in the arts. Under Dillon Ripley’s aegis, the Cooper-
Hewitt Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,
the Renwick Gallery, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and
the National Museum of African Art joined the Smithsonian fam-
ily. The National Museum of American Art and the Portrait
Gallery found new homes in the Old Patent Office Building, lov-
ingly restored under Mr. Ripley’s guidance. The National Air and
Space Museum opened its new building in July 1976. In 1983 con-
struction began on the Quadrangle, Mr. Ripley’s last and most
expansive project on the Mall.

Public accessibility to American culture and diversity was fur-
ther enhanced by a variety of outreach activities, most notably
Smithsonian magazine, which stands as the preeminent publica-

37
tion of its kind in the world today. Other programmatic triumphs
include the annual Folklife Festival, the Archives of American Art,
and the extraordinarily active Associate programs. Were all this
not sufficient, research efforts, assistance to other museums, and
innovative exhibits enhanced the lay public’s and the scholars’
perspectives during Mr. Ripley’s tenure.

The accomplishments of the Ripley years have been supported
in substantial proportions by federal appropriations. In recent
years, nonappropriated trust funds have also contributed an in-
creasing share. In 1964 there were some 40 private donors to the
Institution; in fiscal year 1984 there were more than 30,000. The
unprecedented sum of $37.5 million in private funds was raised,
principally by Mr. Ripley, for the Quadrangle to match monies
pledged by Congress for the project.

Fiscal year 1984 marks the culmination of the growth, excite-
ment, and achievement of the Ripley years. The following pages
detail the Institution’s finances. It is clearly apparent that the
Smithsonian is a far more complex organization than it was in
1964. Four Treasurers served Mr. Ripley: Edgar L. Roy and Otis O.
Martin in the early years; T. Ames Wheeler from 1968 to 1979,
and Christian C. Hohenlohe from 1979 to 1983. John F. Jameson,
Assistant Secretary for Administration, served as Acting Treasurer
from November 1983 through July 1984. Ann R. Leven, former
Treasurer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, joined the Institu-
tion in August 1984.

As the Smithsonian begins the Adams years, the Institution looks
forward to a continuation of the broad-based support of both the
Administration and the Congress and of the public at large for
further enhancement of its research, exhibition, education, and
collection management endeavors.

Operating Funds—Sources and Application

As may be seen from Table 1, the gross amount available for oper-
ations in fiscal year 1984 was $304,350,000, an increase of 9 per-
cent when compared to the previous year’s total of $277,974,000.
Federal appropriations contributed 51 percent of the fiscal year
1984 revenues, nonappropriated sources accounted for 44 percent,
and 5 percent were from federal agency grants and contracts.

38 / Smithsonian Year 1984
After deducting expenses of the nonappropriated auxiliary and
bureau activities, net operating income increased by $18 million
over the prior year to $206,452,000. Federal funds accounted for
76 percent of net revenue, nonappropriated funds contributed 17
percent, a slight increase over fiscal year 1983, with the 7 percent
balance from federal grants and contracts. The application of funds
by all Smithsonian bureaus is outlined in Table 2, with further
supporting detail in other tables.

FEDERAL APPROPRIATION

Federal appropriations provide the core support for the Institution’s
continuing programs in research, exhibitions, education, publishing,
and collections management, including related administrative and
support services. They provide, as well, for the maintenance and
protection of the collections and physical plant.

Federal support for the Institution’s operating programs totaled
$156,683,000 in fiscal year 1984, an increase of $9.4 million over
fiscal year 1983. Although the majority of this increase—some $5.4
million—was required to cover inflationary increases in salaries
and other expenses, significant new funding of $4 million was
provided for a variety of program activities. Of this increase, $1.2
million was received for operations and program requirements at
the Museum Support Center, which in fiscal year 1984 completed
its first full year of operation, and for strengthening the conserva-
tion activity at the center. Complementing the growth in construc-
tion support for major renovations and repairs (discussed below),
funding was received in the operating account for professional
architectural and engineering services and for facilities maintenance
at two off-mall facilities—the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the
National Zoological Park. Other significant increases were provided
for expansion of the Institution’s computing capabilities, for en-
hancing the security of buildings and collections, and for replacing
and upgrading scientific research equipment at the Astrophysical
Observatory and the Tropical Research Institute.

FEDERAL AGENCY GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

Support from federal agencies in the form of grants and contracts
totaled $14,878,000 in fiscal year 1984, an increase of 13 percent
over the previous year. These funds constitute an important source
of research support for the Institution while also benefiting the
granting agencies by providing access to Smithsonian expertise and

Financial Report / 39
resources. As in prior years, the Smithsonian worked closely with
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). As
reflected in Table 3, expenditures under nasa grants and contracts
totaled approximately $11.3 million in fiscal year 1984, primarily
for research programs at the Astrophysical Observatory. Sponsored
research included balloon-borne telescope observations, the study
of meteorite samples from the Antarctic, X-ray telescope studies,
and the design of hydrogen masers.

Support from other agencies provided an additional $3.6 million
for such varied programs as an ecological study of the Chesapeake
Bay Watershed, the 1984 Festival of American Folklife, and a
mariculture project to study and develop food sources from the sea.

NONAPPROPRIATED TRUST FUNDS

Income from nonappropriated trust fund sources including gifts,
grants, endowment and current fund investments, and revenue-
producing activities totaled $132,789,000 in fiscal year 1984. After
exclusion of expenses necessary to generate auxiliary and bureau
activity revenues, net income available for Institutional programs
equaled $34,891,000, an increase of $6.7 million or 24 percent, over
fiscal year 1983. Of the total net income, $24.7 million, or 71 per-
cent, was available for unrestricted program use and was distrib-
uted as approved by the Board of Regents. The balance of approxi-
mately $10.2 million was restricted, that is, available only for
purposes specified by the benefactor.

Restricted fund revenues of $10.2 million were up $1 million
from the previous year. They consisted of $5.9 million from gifts
and grants, $3.2 million from endowment investment income and
interest earned on restricted current fund balances, and $1.1 million
from other sources, primarily fundraising activities at the Archives
of American Art and sales desk activities at the Freer Gallery of
Art. Restricted endowment investment income served as the major
funding source for oceanographic research administered by the
National Museum of Natural History; for operations of the Freer
Gallery of Art (now included in the Center for Asian Art); and a
wide variety of research, exhibition, publication, and educational
activities at other Smithsonian bureaus. Major gift support was
received during the year for important additions to the collections,
including Portrait of Mary Cassatt by Edgar Degas and Callers by
Walter Ufer; for major exhibitions being developed by the National
Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution Trav-

40 / Smithsonian Year 1984
eling Exhibition Service; and for research and archival activities
of the Archives of American Art.

Unrestricted funds include both those available for general op-
erating purposes and a smaller category of Special Purpose funds
that have been internally designated by the Institution. The former
and larger category, Unrestricted General Purpose funds, is derived
primarily from investment income and net revenues of the auxiliary
activities. In fiscal year 1984, net general purpose unrestricted
funds provided over $22 million for general Institutional needs, an
increase of some $5.8 million over the previous year. As displayed
in Table 5, this improved performance was due to increased income
generated by the Institution’s working capital pool invested at
favorable rates and to the strong performance of the auxiliary
activities.

As in past years, the Smithsonian Associate programs contrib-
uted handsomely to auxiliary activity revenues, on both a gross and
net basis, reflecting the continued popularity of the Smithsonian
magazine and the generosity of the Contributing Membership. In
fiscal year 1984, Contributing Members donated approximately
$2.7 million in unrestricted gift support. Income from the Museum
Shops benefited from generally strong sales enhanced by the new
shop at the Museum of American History and high visitation to all
museums. The Mail Order Program offered new items and an ex-
panded catalog. The Smithsonian Institution Press experienced
extremely favorable reviews and sales from its new recording,
“Big Band Jazz from the Beginnings to the Fifties,” and the popular
publication Treasures of the Smithsonian. In October 1983, the
Smithsonian-managed food service operations in the National Air
and Space Museum building and the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden were restored to concession management, affect-
ing the financial statements accordingly.

The general unrestricted funds supported a portion of the Insti-
tution’s administrative costs and most importantly provided for,
among other bureau activities, programs of the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum, the Visitor Information and Associates’ Reception Center,
the Office of Telecommunications, and the Office of Folklife Pro-
grams. In addition, during fiscal year 1984, there were special
allotments for several major exhibitions and related activities, in-
cluding the Shanghai exhibition in the Thomas Mellon Evans
Special Exhibition Gallery, the Hirshhorn tenth anniversary exhibi-
tion, and Smithsonian participation in the Edinburgh Festival. The

Financial Report / 41
development of a new, integrated personnel/payroll system also
received funding. Transfers to special purpose funds financed the
Collections Acquisition, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Out-
reach Programs ($2,250,000), stipends for pre- and postdoctoral
fellows under the Smithsonian Fellowship program ($1,738,000),
income-sharing to the bureaus for their discretionary uses ($638,-
000), research grants to Smithsonian professional staff ($400,000),
and other projects. An amount of $3.4 million was transferred to
plant funds for Quadrangle development and for the purchase of
a residence for Smithsonian Secretaries. To build the future re-
sources of the Institution, $3.3 million was transferred to unre-
stricted endowment.

The Unrestricted Special Purpose funds were supplemented by
approximately $4.6 million during fiscal year 1984, principally with
monies generated by bureau activities. Illustrative of such revenue
activities are fees charged for films at the National Air and Space
Museum and the admission and membership fees at the Cooper-
Hewitt Museum. Investment income earned on unexpended fund
balances and from designated endowments added $700,000. Gifts
and miscellaneous income, such as zoo parking receipts that are
being reserved for future expansion of parking facilities at the
National Zoo, brought in another $1.2 million.

Special Foreign Currency Program

Foreign currencies, accumulated primarily from sales of surplus
agricultural commodities under Public Law 83-480 and determined
by the Treasury Department to be in excess of the current needs
of the United States, are made available to the Institution through
the Special Foreign Currency Appropriation. In fiscal year 1984, an
appropriation of excess foreign currencies equivalent to $7,040,000
was received under this program by the Smithsonian. Included in
this amount was $4 million (as compared to last year’s $2 million)
to continue a program of grants to United States institutions for
field research and advanced professional training in fields of tradi-
tional Smithsonian interest and competence.

An additional $2 million was provided to the Indian rupee re-
serve account established in fiscal year 1980 to ensure continued
program support of the American Institute of Indian Studies. The

42 / Smithsonian Year 1984
balance of $1,040,000 represented the second increment of support
for the international effort to restore and preserve the ancient city
of Moenjodaro in Pakistan. An additional amount in nonconvertible
Pakistani currency is expected to be sought by the Institution to
fulfill the United States’ commitment to the project. Obligations
during the fiscal year by research discipline and country are pro-
vided in Table 8.

Construction

New funding in fiscal year 1984 for construction and renovation
projects at the Institution totaled $24,126,000. As shown in Table
9, a federal appropriation of $9 million was provided for restoration
and renovation of existing Smithsonian facilities. A further $3.5
million was designated specifically for construction and renovation
of National Zoological Park facilities both at Rock Creek Park and
Front Royal. The types of projects funded include facade, roof,
and terrace repairs necessary to maintain the structural integrity
of buildings; the planning and installation of fire detection and
suppression systems; improvements to utility systems to increase
energy efficiency and to provide stable temperature and humidity
conditions for the preservation of the collections; and repairs, mod-
ifications, and improvements to preserve and maintain the Institu-
tion’s buildings in a safe and energy efficient manner. In addition,
federal dollars covered construction of a much-needed veterinary
hospital at Front Royal.

By September 30, 1984, the Institution had achieved its $37.5
million goal equal to one-half the estimated cost of constructing the
Quadrangle Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures.
Of the total raised, $10.8 million was received in fiscal year 1984:
$8.1 million was from gifts and earned interest and $2.7 million
was a transfer from unrestricted trust funds. It must be noted that
Congress rescinded $8 million of the $36.5 million appropriated in
fiscal year 1983 for its share of Quadrangle construction. This
action was based on anticipated savings resulting from the unex-
pectedly low contract bid for construction. In taking this action,
Congress restated its commitment to sharing equally the project’s
cost and indicated a willingness to reconsider its decision based on
identified need.

Financial Report / 43
Other nonappropriated receipts include grant support for con-
struction of research facilities at the Tropical Research Institute, a
donation for relocation of an antique greenhouse, and interest
earned on unexpended gifts to plant funds. In addition to the $2.7
million for Quadrangle construction, transfers from unrestricted
funds were made for the purchase and improvement of a residence
for Smithsonian Secretaries and for mortgage payments on prop-
erty currently occupied by the National Museum of African Art.

Endowment and Similar Funds

As of September 30, 1984, the market value of the Smithsonian
Endowment Fund was $132,416,000, as compared to $132,031,000
on September 30, 1983. Of this, $131,113,000 is invested in the
Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund under outside investment
management, $1,000,000 is on permanent deposit in the United
States Treasury as required, and the remaining $303,000 includes
restricted stock and donated real estate. As shown in Table 10, the
majority of the funds, 56 percent ($74,672,000), represents re-
stricted endowment, with income available only for the purposes
specified by the donor. The remaining 44 percent ($57,744,000) are
unrestricted endowment funds, with income available for general
support of the Institution. Certain of the unrestricted funds, such
as the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History Endowment, have
been designated by the Regents for specific purposes. A complete
listing of all endowment funds, together with current book and
market values, may be seen in Table 13.

Investment of the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund is
subject to policy guidelines established by the Board of Regents.
Funds are managed by professional advisory firms under the over-
sight of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasury. During
fiscal year 1984, the number of managers was increased to four
with the addition of Granahan-Everitt Investments, Inc. As of the
end of the year, the respective portion of the fund by manager was:
Fiduciary Trust Company of New York (46 percent), Batterymarch
Financial Management (30 percent), Torray Clark & Company (20
percent), and Granahan-Everett Investments, Inc. (4 percent).

For fiscal year 1984, the total rate of return (market appreciation
as well as interest and dividend yield) of the Pooled Consolidated

44 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Endowment Fund, as calculated by an independent investment
measurement service, was +0.4 percent, as compared to +4.6 per-
cent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Average and +2.2 percent for
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both calculated on the same
basis. The year-end market values and the recap of activity of the
Consolidated Endowment over the past five years are reflected in
Tables 11 and 12, respectively.

Under the Total Return Income policy followed by the Institu-
tion, total investment return is defined as yield (interest and divi-
dends) plus appreciation, including both realized and unrealized
gains. A portion of this return is made available for expenditure
each year, and the remainder is reinvested as principal. This total
return income payout is determined in advance of the fiscal year
by the Board of Regents based on a review of anticipated interest
and dividend yields, support needs of the Institution’s bureaus and
scientists, inflationary factors, and the five-year running average of
market values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital.
After income payout of $3,820,000 in fiscal year 1984 to endow-
ments in the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund, $2,794,000 of
excess interest and dividend yield was available for reinvestment
into endowment principal. Net transfers to endowment, primarily
to unrestricted endowment funds, provided an additional $3.5
million with $283,000 received in gifts and other income. At the
request of the donor, balances in the Shryock Endowment for
Docents were transferred to restricted current funds.

Upon request, a listing of the securities held in the Pooled Con-
solidated Endowment Fund as of September 30, 1984, may be ob-
tained from the Treasurer of the Institution.

Related Organizations

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts were established by Congress within the Institu-
tion. Each organization is administered by its own board of trustees
and reports independently on its financial status. Fiscal, administra-
tive, and other support services are provided the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars on a reimbursement basis; office
space is made available for center operations.

Financial Report / 45
An independent nonprofit corporation, the Friends of the Na-
tional Zoo (FONZ) operates under contract a number of beneficial
concessions for the National Zoological Park. During calendar year
1983 (FONZ’s fiscal year), FONZ concession and rental fees to the
Smithsonian amounted to approximately $431,000. In addition,
FONZ contributed other important financial and volunteer support
to zoo programs. Additional information on FONZ is to be found
elsewhere in Smithsonian Year 1984.

Reading Is Fundamental, Inc., associated with the Institution
since 1968, now operates as an independent, separately incor-
porated entity dedicated to the improvement of reading abilities
in children. Primary support is derived from private contributions
and a federal contract with the Department of Education to operate
the Federal Inexpensive Book Distribution Program. Administrative
services are offered by the Institution on a contract basis.

For fiscal year 1984, the Smithsonian also provided administra-
tive and fiscal assistance to the Visions Foundation, a start-up
venture in the arts.

Accounting and Auditing

The Institution’s funds, federal and nonappropriated, are audited
annually by the independent public accounting firm of Coopers
and Lybrand. Their report for fiscal year 1984 is reprinted on the
following pages. The Smithsonian’s internal audit staff audits
Smithsonian activities and financial systems throughout the year.
Additionally, the Defense Contract Audit Agency conducts an
annual audit of grants and contracts received from federal agencies
and monitors allocated administrative costs.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents met
several times during the year pursuant to their responsibility under
the bylaws of the Institution. The committee is charged with
reviewing the Smithsonian’s accounting systems and _ internal
financial controls; facilitating communication between the Board
of Regents and the internal audit staff, the independent accounting
firm, and the General Accounting Office; and reviewing operations
of the Institution for compliance with approved programs and
policies.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution

We have examined the statement of financial condition of the
Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1984 and the related
statement of financial activity for the year then ended. Our exam-
ination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards and with generally accepted governmental auditing stan-
dards and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting rec-
ords and such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We previously examined and reported upon
the financial statements of the Smithsonian Institution for the
year ended September 30, 1983, totals of which are included in
the accompanying financial statements for comparative purposes
only.

In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended
September 30, 1984, referred to above, present fairly the financial
position of the Smithsonian Institution as of September 30, 1984,
and the results of its operations and changes in its fund balances
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of
the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation. These financial statements do not include the accounts
of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts or the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which
were established by Congress within the Smithsonian Institution (the Insti-
tuition) but are administered under separate boards of trustees. (See Note 2.)

The accounts of the federal funds have been prepared on the obligation
basis of accounting, which basis is in accordance with accounting principles
prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States as set forth in
the Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The
obligation basis of accounting differs in some respects from generally ac-
cepted accounting principles. Under this basis of accounting, commitments
of the operating fund, such as purchase orders and contracts, are recognized
as expenditures, and the related obligations are reported on the balance
sheet even though goods and services have not been received. Such commit-
ments aggregated $33,045,000 at September 30, 1984. In addition, construction
commitments amounted to $29,552,000 at September 30, 1984.

The trust funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from
private sources, federal grants and contracts, investment income and certain
business activities related to the operations of the Institution. The federal
funds reflect the receipt and expenditures of funds obtained from Congres-
sional appropriations.

Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed
on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the
Institution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund account-
ing. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are
classified for funds control, accounting and reporting purposes into funds
established according to their appropriation, nature, and purposes. Separate
accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying finan-
cial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined
into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded
and reported by fund group.

The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institution are reported in
self-balancing fund groups as follows:

Trust current funds, which include unrestricted and restricted resources,
represent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of
Institution operations. Amounts restricted by the donor for specific pur-
poses are segregated from other current funds.

Trust endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to
restrictions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal
be invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment
and similar funds are gifts which allow the expenditure of principal but
only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds.

62 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing board
for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of
such funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds repre-
sent gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the
principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the
governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the
income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.

Trust plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisi-
tions and funds expended for plant. Pledges for the construction of the
Center for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures are recorded as
gifts in the plant fund in the period the pledge document is received.

Federal operating funds consist of separate subfund groups maintained
for each appropriation—Salaries and Expenses appropriations, which are
available for obligation in the current year only. Special Foreign Currency
appropriations and Barro Colorado Island Trust Fund, for which unex-
pended funds from the current year can be carried forward and obligated
in subsequent years.

Federal construction funds represent the portion of expendable funds that
is available for building and facility construction, restoration, renovation,
and repair. Separate subfund groups are maintained for each appropria-
tion—Construction and Improvements, National Zoological Park, Restora-
tion and Renovation of Buildings, Museum Support Center and the Center
for African, Near Eastern, and Asian Cultures (Quadrangle).

Federal capital funds represent the amount of the investment of the
United States Government in the net assets of the Institution acquired
with federal funds and nonexpendable property transfers from Govern-
ment agencies.

Investments. All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other
disposition of investments and property are accounted for in the fund in
which the related assets are recorded. Income from investments is accounted
for in a similar manner, except for income derived from investments of en-
dowment and similar funds, which is accounted for in the fund to which it is
restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenue in unrestricted current funds. Gains
and losses on the sale of investments are recognized using the specific identi-
fication method, whereby the cost of the specific security adjusted by any
related discount or premium amortization is the basis for recognition of the
gain or loss.

Inventory. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, retail cost method (for
those inventories held for resale) or net realizable value.

Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian
Magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription,
which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian
Magazine are charged against income over the period of the subscription.

The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary
activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.

Works of art, living or other specimens. The Institution acquires its collec-
tions, which include works of art, library books, photographic archives,

Financial Report / 63
objects and specimens, through purchase or by donation. In accordance with
policies generally followed by museums, no value is assigned to the collec-
tions on the statement of financial condition. Purchases for the collections
are expensed currently.

Property and equipment. Capital improvements and equipment purchased
with trust funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized
at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of 3 to 10 years. Equipment purchased with trust funds for use by
non-income-producing activities is treated as a deduction of the current fund
and a capitalized cost of the plant fund. Depreciation on equipment capital-
ized in the plant fund is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of 3 to 10 years (see Note 9). Equipment purchased with federal
funds is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
period of 10 years.

Real estate (land and buildings) purchased with trust funds is recorded
at cost, to the extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended
therefor, or appraised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands
in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded
at nominal values. Costs of original building structures and major additions
are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 30 years. Costs of reno-
vating, restoring and improving structures are depreciated over their esti-
mated useful lives of 15 years (see Note 9).

Buildings and other structures, additions to buildings and fixed equipment
purchased with federal funds are recorded at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over a period of 30 years. Costs of renovating, restoring
and improving structures are depreciated over their useful lives of 15 years.

Certain lands occupied by the Institution’s buildings were appropriated
and reserved by Congress for that purpose and are not reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. Property and nonexpendable equipment
acquired through transfer from Government agencies are capitalized at the
transfer price or at estimated amounts, taking into consideration their use-
fulness, condition, and market value.

Government grants and contracts. The Institution has a number of grants
and contracts with the U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost
reimbursement to the Institution. Grant and contract revenue is recognized
when billable or received in the trust funds.

Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made
significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s
programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these state-
ments since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.
Annual leave unfunded. The Institution’s civil service employees earn annual
leave in accordance with federal law and regulations. However, only the cost
of leave taken as salaries is funded and recorded as an expense. The cost
of unused annual leave at year-end is reflected in the accompanying financial
statements as an asset and accrued liability in the federal funds.

2. Related activities

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several separately
incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution serve

64 / Smithsonian Year 1984
on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these orga-
nizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Institution
facilities occupied, etc. totaled approximately $355,000 for the year ended
September 30, 1984. Deposits held in custody for these organizations are
$3,029,000 as of September 30, 1984.

The following summarizes the approximate expenditures of these orga-
nizations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1984 as reflected in their
individual financial statements and which are not included in the accompany-
ing financial statements of the Institution:

Since October 1, 1982, the deposit with the U.S. Treasury has been in-
vested in U.S. Government securities at a variable yield based on market
interest rates.

Substantially all the investments of the endowment and similar funds are
pooled on a market value basis (consolidated fund) with each individual fund
subscribing to or disposing of units on the basis of the value per unit at
market value at the beginning of the month within which the transaction
takes place. Of the total units, each having a market value of $203.92, 293,996
units were owned by endowment and 348,976 units were owned by quasi-
endowment at September 30, 1984.

66 / Smithsonian Year 1984
The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment manage-
ment of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach,
the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized
gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal
to the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and
the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or
from the current funds.

In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being
available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such
factors as, but not limited to: (1) 412% of the five-year average of the market
value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2)
current dividends and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scien-
tists, and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index;
however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is
less than 110°/o of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of dona-
tion), the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received.
The total return factor for 1984 was $6.74 per unit to the Restricted and
Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $5.00 per unit to the Unrestricted
General Purpose Endowment Funds; new units were purchased for the Unre-
stricted Endowment Funds with the $1.74, the difference in the total return
factor. The total return applied for 1984 was $2,594,000 to the Restricted
and Designated Purpose Endowment Funds and $1,226,000 to the Unrestricted
General Purpose Endowment Funds.

7. Receivables

8. Advance payments

Advance payments represent advances made to Government agencies, educa-
tional institutions, firms and individuals for services to be rendered or
property or materials to be furnished.

Financial Report / 67
As of September 30, 1984, the Institution had advances outstanding to the
U.S. Government of approximately $10,807,000, principally for construction
services to be received in the future. The Institution at that date also had
advances outstanding to educational institutions amounting to approximately
$1,420,000, principally under the Special Foreign Currency Program.

9. Property and equipment

Depreciation and amortization expense for 1984 for trust funds’ income-
producing assets amounted to approximately $957,000, which is included in
auxiliary activities expenditures in the current funds. Depreciation of trust
funds’ nonincome-producing equipment and buildings for 1984 amounted to
approximately $650,000.

Depreciation expense reflected in expenditures of the federal capital funds
for 1984 was $11,437,000.

The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1984 included $32,201,000
of unexpended plant funds.

68 / Smithsonian Year 1984
10. Appropriations

For the year ended September 30, 1984, the Institution was awarded
$12,500,000 for various construction projects. Funds appropriated in the
prior year for Quadrangle construction were reduced in fiscal year 1984 by
$8,000,000.

11. Pension plan

The Institution has separate retirement plans for trust and federal employees.
Under the trust fund’s plan, both the Institution and employees contribute
stipulated percentages of salary which are used to purchase individual an-
nuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with the employees. The
cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1984, was $3,195,000. It is
the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued currently. There are
no unfunded prior service costs under the plan.

The federal employees of the Institution are covered by the Civil Service
Retirement Program. Under this program, the Institution withholds from the
gross pay of each federal employee and remits to the Civil Service Retirement
and Disability Fund (the Fund) the amounts specified by such program. The
Institution contributes 7% of basic annual salary to the Fund. The cost of
the plan for the year ended September 30, 1984, was approximately $5,900,000.

12. Excess expenditures and other deductions

The net excess of expenditures and other deductions over revenue and other
additions disclosed for federal construction funds in the Statement of the
Activity for the year ended September 30, 1984 arose because certain appro-
priations, having been recorded as revenue and other additions in prior years
and carried forward as fund balance, were expended during the year. Addi-
tionally, funds appropriated in the prior year were reduced in fiscal year 1984
(see Note 10).

13. Nonmandatory transfers for designated purposes

The following transfers among trust funds were made for the year ended
September 30, 1984 in thousands of dollars:

14. Income taxes

The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in
that section are taxable only on their unrelated business income, which was
immaterial for the Institution for 1984.

It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation as an
instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of the
Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income
taxation. The Institution has not as yet formally sought such dual status.

SCIENCE

DAVID CHALLINOR,
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE

National Air and Space Museum

The National Air and Space Museum (NAsM) remains the most
popular museum in the world. On May 24 director Walter J.
Boyne welcomed the 75 millionth visitor—a thirteen-year-old
student from Chicago. This spring the museum enjoyed record-
breaking days of more than 100,000 visitors. Attendance this year
substantially exceeded that of any previous year since the opening.

Under the leadership of a new associate director for research,
NASM staff members continued their efforts to establish the mu-
seum as the preeminent center for research in the history of air
and space technology and geophysical science. The first National
Air and Space Museum Research Report, to be published annually
beginning in the fall of 1984, highlights the results of staff re-
search and describes the collections, facilities, and resources avail-
able to scholars. The Research Report will also promote interest
in nasM fellowships, chairs, and research programs.

A new committee structure will help to strengthen the NasM
research effort. Staff committees assist in planning and implement-
ing long-range research programs, solicit proposals for new pub-
lications and research projects, develop ideas for new symposia
and teaching programs, advise on visiting or contract appoint-
ments, and recommend courses of action to the director. An ex-
ternal Research Advisory Committee, composed of leading figures
in various disciplines appropriate to NASM, will advise and assist
the museum in developing new programs in history and science.

Several major historical research programs are under way. Work

73
is progressing on a multivolume Smithsonian History of Aviation.
Scheduled to appear serially between 1986 and 1989, the volumes
will provide a comprehensive history of flight from antiquity to
the present. The series will consider not only the development of
aerospace technology but the role of flight in shaping life in the
twentieth century. As a part of this effort, major archival collec-
tion and bibliographic projects are being undertaken. The program
has also become a focal point for attracting talented interns, fel-
lows, and visiting scholars to the museum.

The Space Telescope History Project, a joint undertaking of the
museum and Johns Hopkins University, will result in a published
history of the ambitious orbital astronomical observatory of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa). The book,
to appear the year the Space Telescope is launched, will explore
political, technological, scientific, and managerial aspects of this
multi-billion dollar program.

The Space Telescope History Project also includes an oral-
history effort involving the collection of more than 100 transcribed
taped interviews. This is an extension of the Space Astronomy
Oral History Program, now in its third year. A catalogue of tran-
scriptions completed to date is available.

Yet another team project will study the origins of the NASA
program to orbit a large space station. This effort will not only
result in a book but also in the identification and preservation of
papers documenting the development of space exploration.

Staff members of the Space Science and Exploration Department
and Aeronautics Department are compiling a bibliography of
secondary materials on the history of air and space. This will be a
carefully selected, heavily annotated listing of the most significant
scholarly works in the field.

In an attempt to extend the utility of museum resources, steps
are being taken to explore the opportunities for interaction with
major institutions of higher learning in the United States and
abroad. This year a successful cooperative course entitled ““Twen-
tieth Century Technology” was conducted by museum staff in
conjunction with New York University. Based on this initial effort,
a pilot course in the history of science and technology, using the
museum as a learning resource, is being designed and will be
offered by New York and Oxford universities in 1985. Discussions
with the University of Cambridge are leading to new areas of
cooperation, including possible nasm/Cambridge summer projects
in 1985.

74 / Smithsonian Year 1984
In geophysical science, the museum’s Center for Earth and
Planetary Studies continued to advance scientific research in plane-
tary and terrestrial remote sensing. Orbital remote-sensing re-
search concentrated on digital image-processing methods for anal-
ysis of diverse types of data, while terrestrial remote-sensing
research concentrated on the desert fringe areas in western Africa
and on the inland delta of the Niger River in Mali. The center also
continued terrestrial research on interpreting thermal infrared
data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instru-
ment on the Nimbus satellites, comparing these data with more
conventional Landsat images. Under continued support by Nnasa’s
Planetary Geology program, research into the nature and origin
of structural features on the surface of Mars was performed
during 1984.

Research at the museum was reflected not only in the seventy
articles written by staff members, but in the museum’s active and
varied publishing program. Tom Crouch’s The Eagle Aloft: Two
Centuries of the Balloon in America received the 1984 Aviation/ —
Space Writers Association national award for best nonfiction book
and was widely acclaimed as the definitive work on the subject.
Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile, by Gregory
Kennedy, and an article by Walter Boyne, “Boundary Layer:
Macho Masochism,” received awards from the Aviation/Space
Writers Mideast Region. Black Wings: The American Black in
Aviation, by Von Hardesty and Dominick Pisano, and the exhibi-
tion booklet Milestones of Flight won awards from the Society
for Technical Communication, Washington chapter.

The variety of nasm publications is reflected in the nine new
titles issued this year. The de Havilland DH-4: From Flaming
Coffin to Living Legend, by Walter Boyne, is the seventh book in
the Famous Aircraft of the National Air and Space Museum series.
United States Women in Aviation, 1920-1929, by Kathleen
Brooks-Pazmany, became the second in the continuing series on
U.S. women in aviation. Combat Flying Clothing—Army Air
Forces Clothing during World War II, by C. G. Sweeting, and
Winged Wonders: The Story of the Flying Wings, by E. T. Wool-
dridge, were the first comprehensive works published on those
subjects in the United States.

At Home in the Sky: The Aviation Art of Frank Wootton—the
first art exhibition catalogue to be published by the museum—and
a style manual for NasM correspondence, publications, and exhibi-
tion scripts added new dimensions to the publications program.

The fifteenth anniversary of man’s first landing on the moon was celebrated at
the National Air and Space Museum with a Lunar Landing Party on the evening
of July 20. More than 4,000 visitors enjoyed highlights tours, IMAX films, and
a selection of lunar “touchables.”

AWY AVIATION

iss

Golden Age of Flight, a major new gallery at the National Air and Space
Museum, is devoted to aviation between the two world wars. Two of the five
airplanes displayed in the gallery include a reproduction of the Gee Bee Z
(below), a distinctive aircraft of radical design that epitomized 1930s air racing,
and the Beechcraft Staggerwing (top), a luxury private and business aircraft.
Nasm’s quarterly Special Presentations Calendar was expanded
to include broader information on museum programs in a monthly
format. Naso also published its first theater booklet, highlighting
in photos the spectacular footage from the max films and describ-
ing the films and the max process. In addition, five nasm books
were reprinted this year. Planning is also under way for a new
series of monographs documenting the origins, historical and tech-
nological context, and physical characteristics of the space artifacts
in the NAsM collection.

Important steps were taken to strengthen the museum’s archival
and artifact collections. Staff members and interns inventoried
thirty-eight separate reference and archival collections on space
science, using the museum’s data processing system as a cata-
loguing aid. Finding aids were also prepared for two significant
large collections, the papers of Andrew G. Halley, space law and
space travel society pioneer; and the papers of the American
Astronautical Society. In addition, Nasm arranged to copy and
electronically store portions of the Wernher von Braun papers.

The museum remains a pioneer in the development of new
archival technologies. The nasm System for Digital Recovery (spr)
will advance the art of archiving high-quality reproductions of
manuscripts, photographs, and printed documents. The spr com-
bines a digital camera, a computer, a digital videodisc, a printer,
and software to store, retrieve, and print all types of historical
documents. The system also permits automatic indexing of printed
material. Such new technologies will extend the accessibility and
utility of the Nasm archives and enable staff members to better
serve the public.

Nasm produced a second laser videodisc in 1984. Archival
Videodisc 2, containing 100,000 photographs of aerospace per-
sonalities and events, airships, balloons, commercial aircraft, air
meets, trophies, military aviation, aerospace museums, and aero-
nautical communications supplements the first videodisc, which
contained aircraft photographs. Archival Videodisc 3, containing
U.S. Air Force World War II and prewar photographs, is near com-
pletion. Duplicate discs are available at low cost to other museums,
educational institutions, governmental agencies, and the public.

Twelve exhibitions were presented this year. A new gallery,
Golden Age of Flight, tells the story of the pilots, engineers, in-
dustrialists, and adventurers who contributed to the phenomenal
growth of aviation during the period 1919-39. As an adjunct to
this exhibition, the museum sponsored an art competition.

78 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Four major galleries were updated in 1984. Dr. Franklin’s Win-
dow: American Witnesses to the Birth of Flight, a new introductory
unit for the Balloons and Airships gallery, was opened as part of
the nasM celebration of the 200th anniversary of the first flight in
the United States. A Dassault Falcon is the centerpiece of an addi-
tion to the Hall of Air Transportation, describing development of
the air express industry. An addition to the Apollo to the Moon
gallery details the crucial space-age decisions made by The Admin-
istrators of Nasa. At Work in Space, a new unit in the Space Hall
display, highlights the inflight coveralls of astronauts Guion S.
Bluford and Sally Ride, donated by America’s first black and first
woman astronauts in space, respectively.

Smaller exhibitions this year commemorated the aerospace con-
tributions of German-Americans, on the 300th anniversary of
German immigration to America, and the first manned crossing of
the Pacific by the balloon Double Eagle V. The Berlin Airlift was
the subject of a special exhibition celebrating the centennial of the
birth of President Harry Truman.

Major art exhibitions included the works of Robert McCall and
John Amendola. In the McCall exhibition were many of that
artist’s creative visions of future cities in space, space stamp de-
signs, and several large-scale murals. The John Amendola show
featured the commissioned art for many of the nasm book covers.

Two new presentations were prepared by the nas staff in 1984.
The Oldest Dream: A Celebration of Flight, a multi-media show
using film, slides, and numerous special effects, opened in Novem-
ber 1983 in the Albert Einstein Sky Theater. Treasures of the
National Air and Space Museum, a short film on Nasm, is being
shown at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los
Angeles and on United Airlines flights.

The growth and preservation of the nasm coliection remains at
the heart of the museum’s program. The first complete restoration
of a space artifact, the Fairchild ATS-6 spacecraft, is under way at
the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration and Storage Facility.
Craftsmen there also completed restoration of the five aircraft for
the Golden Age of Flight gallery.

Among the aircraft added to the collections this year were the
Quickie, a home-built aircraft; the Beck-Mahoney Sorceress, a
racing biplane; Himat, a Nasa research vehicle; the Spirit of Texas,
the first helicopter to fly around the world; a Republic RC-3 Sea-
bee amphibian; the MacCready Solar Challenger, which made the
first solar-powered flight in history; the Hispano HA-200 Cairo jet

Science / 79
trainer, acquired from the Egyptian government; and a Grumman
Goose, a classic amphibian.

Some of the items added to the already impressive nasM collec-
tion of spacecraft and space instruments were the Baker-Nunn
satellite tracking camera used to photograph the first man-made
satellites in 1957 and 1958; the Skylab X-ray telescope, one of
two major imaging instruments aboard Skylab; and a test model
of the Pioneer Venus space probe.

Naso continued to share its collections through loans to other
institutions. Objects were lent to the California Museum of Science
and Industry in time for their special exhibitions during the 1984
Summer Olympics. Nasm also participated in the Treasures from
the Smithsonian exhibition in Edinburgh. Three sites (Smithsonian
Traveling Exhibition Service) exhibitions include objects from the
NASM collection. In addition, the sires Black Wings exhibition was
expanded from two to three traveling units.

In a ceremony held beneath the Wright Flyer in the Milestones
of Flight gallery, director Walter Boyne accepted one of the orig-
inal propellers used on the first heavier-than-air powered flight
from Wilkinson Wright, a grandnephew of the Wright brothers.
World War I ace Ray Brooks reminisced about flying the SPAD
XIII at a ceremony at the Garber Facility, where the SPAD XIII
is being restored. In a ceremony on May 18, the Viking Lander on
Mars was transferred from Nasa into the NAsm collection, making
NASM the first truly interplanetary museum.

The popular Garber Facility open house held in April attracted
7,500 visitors. A Lunar Landing Party open house held at Nasm
on the evening of July 20, 1984, drew more than 4,000 people to
celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the first landing on the
Moon.

A new position of associate director for external affairs was
established to oversee the museum’s publications, education pro-
grams, theater operations, and public affairs programs, and to
increase the museum’s ties to the academic and business com-
munities.

The Samuel P. Langley Theater continued to be one of the most
popular attractions in Washington, D.C. Since opening day, July 1,
1976, the theater has attracted audiences totaling well over thirteen
million. The award-winning To Fly!, the theater’s first imax movie,
remains its most popular attraction, having drawn audiences of
more than three-quarters of a million this year alone and more
than eight million since its first showing. Two evening IMAx

The National Air and Space Museum’s videodisc project provides scholars and
researchers access to the museum’s vast collection of archival photographs—one
million in all. Ten discs are planned, each containing 100,000 photographs of
the aircraft, spacecraft, people, and artifacts associated with the history and
development of aviation and space flight.

festivals, featuring Volcano/Behold Hawaii and To Fly!, Flyers,
and Living Planet, were well attended, as were the annual aviation
and space fiction film series.

Financial sponsorship was obtained this year for two new IMAXx
films to be shown in the Langley Theater. Nasm will receive a
share of the income from the rental of these films, which will be
seen in theaters worldwide. The Dream Is Alive, sponsored by
Lockheed Corporation and the Smithsonian Institution, is the first
large-format film to be shot on location in space. Spectacular film
footage was obtained by the astronauts using the IMAx camera on
the Space Shuttle missions in April and August 1984. Additional
filming is scheduled for future Space Shuttle missions. The Dream
Is Alive is expected to premiere at NASM in the summer of 1985.

The second new max film, On the Wing, sponsored by Johnson
Wax, will explore man’s fascination with natural and mechanical
flight. Innovative motion picture techniques will be featured, in-
cluding the imaginative use of fiber optics and computer graphics.
This film is expected to open at the museum in the spring of 1986.

Dr. Paul MacCready, designer of the Gossamer series of ad-
vanced flying machines, has assembled a team of specialists in
aerodynamics, mechanical engineering, and paleobiology to study
the feasibility of building, for Nasm, a full-scale working replica
of Quetzalcoatlus northropi, believed to be the world’s largest
flying creature. The dinosaur replica, if built, will be featured in
the film On the Wing.

The usual heavy schedule of lectures and symposia continued
in the Langley Theater in 1984. Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson,
manager of nasa’s Space Shuttle Program, offered the seventh
annual Wernher von Braun Memorial Lecture. The annual Lind-
bergh lecture featured Jeffrey Quill, whose test flying played a
prominent role in the evolution of the Spitfire. Nine GE-sponsored
aviation lectures were well attended. Special presentations in the
Albert Einstein Sky Theater included seven lectures in the annual
“Exploring Space with Astronomers” series, the twice-weekly
“Noontime with the Stars” talks, and the twelve monthly sky
lectures.

The three major symposia sponsored by NasM this year offered
the public an opportunity to hear presentations by the foremost
contributors to aerospace history and the geophysical sciences.
“The Wright Flyer: An Engineering Perspective,” commemorated
the eightieth anniversary of the invention of the airplane and
underscored the technical achievements embodied in the 1903

82 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Wright Flyer. Papers offered by the five participating engineers will
be published in the Smithsonian Studies in Air and Space series.

“The Apollo Legacy,” held on the fifteenth anniversary of the
Apollo 11 lunar landing, brought together five well-known sci-
entists and four astronauts to review the scientific impact of the
Apollo missions.

“Vertical Flight: The Age of the Helicopter,” a symposium held
in conjunction with the Fortieth Annual Forum of the American
Helicopter Society, featured presentations on the history and
future of vertical flight. Selected papers, edited by Walter Boyne
and Donald Lopez, were published in conjunction with the sym-
posium.

The museum docents maintained a busy schedule, serving more
than 39,000 visitors this year. Another 24,000 visitors toured the
Garber Facility. Tours for school children reached 9,000 students.

President Reagan helped celebrate Nasa’s twenty-fifth anni-
versary at NASM. The President also delivered the keynote speech
at the annual dinner honoring General James Doolittle, held at the
museum. Vice-President Bush and the Premier of Bermuda, John
Swan, were honored at a dinner in the Flight and the Arts gallery.
The Vice-President also introduced the film Air Force One: The
Planes and the Presidents at a special premiere at the museum.
Nasm was chosen as the location for a reception in honor of the
King and Queen of Nepal when they visited the Smithsonian.

Major steps were taken toward the development of a new NASM
facility at Dulles International Airport to house and display air
and space craft that cannot be accommodated at nasm or the
Garber Facility and to serve as a location for museum functions.
The Federal Aviation Administration earmarked approximately
100 acres of land at Dulles for the proposed facility, and bills were
introduced in both houses of Congress to authorize its construc-
tion. On April 25, a B-17G Flying Fortress flew into the Dulles
site, and was donated to the museum by its owner and pilot in a
special ceremony.

Plans are under way for nasm to be the control center for a
nonstop, nonrefueled, around-the-world flight attempt of the
Voyager aircraft designed by Burt Rutan. Naso is also exploring
the possibility of being the control center for a nonstop, around-
the-world balloon flight by the Endeavor, which would begin and
end in Australia.

The success of nasM is based on a blending of the new with the
old—a creative use of modern technology and innovative manage-

Science / 83
ment strategies to solve the traditional museum problems of col-
lection, preservation, and exhibition. In charting the future of the
museum as a research institution, we hope to develop a similar
creative approach that will make the priceless resources of our
collection available to the scholarly community.

National Museum of Natural History

EXHIBITIONS

Exploring Microspace (March 16—July 15), an exhibition that
traced the evolution of the microscope from the seventeenth cen-
tury to the electronic age, and displayed video and photomural
images of the unseen microscopic world, was one of five immensely
popular Thomas M. Evans Gallery shows that helped bring a
record six million visitors to the National Museum of Natural
History (NMNH) in 1983-84. Live demonstrations of a scanning
electron microscope and a state-of-the-art optical microscope,
plugged into TV monitors, made it possible for the public to see
museum science in action. Organized by curators Drs. Frederick M.
Bayer, Richard H. Benson, and Richard S. Boardman, with assis-
tance from the Armed Forces Medical Museum, Dr. Cecil Fox
of the National Institutes of Health, the James Smithson Society,
and the Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Services (sites), the
exhibition is now on a two-year tour of museums throughout the
United States.

The Art of Cameroon (February 1—June 17), a siTEs-organized
exhibition, surveyed the significance and splendor of one of
Africa’s major art traditions. Ban Chiang: Discovery of a Lost
Bronze Age (November 2—January 31), organized jointly by sites
and the University of Pennsylvania, exhibited archeological dis-
coveries that have changed the prevailing view of Southeast Asia’s
role in the development of civilization. The Precious Legacy:
Judaic Treasures from the Czechoslovak State Collections (Novem-
ber 9—January 1) was a sites exhibition of one of the largest and
most important Judaic collections in the world. Almost 2,000 peo-
ple a day saw the exhibition weekdays and as many as 3,000 a
day on weekends and holidays. A ticketing system was set up for
the first time in the museum’s history to prevent long lines from
forming. Treasures from the Shanghai Museum: 6000 Years of

84 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Chinese Art (August 11-November 30), the most comprehensive
major Chinese art exhibition ever to tour the United States, dis-
played 232 masterpieces from the collections of one of China’s
leading museums. This exhibition was organized by the Asia Art
Museum of San Francisco in cooperation with the Shanghai
Museum.

Rotunda Gallery exhibitions in 1983-84 featured: Roger Tory
Peterson at the Smithsonian (April 27—-September 3), a compre-
hensive retrospective of Peterson’s bird art, marking the fiftieth
anniversary of his influential book A Field Guide to the Birds (The
exhibition was organized by curator Dr. Richard L. Zusi); Draw-
ings of African Mammals (November 14—January 2) by African
naturalist Jonathan Kingdon; photographs of The Nazca Lines by
Marilyn Bridges (January 6—April 16); and Thirty Years of Scien-
tific Illustrations Drawn in the Museum of Natural History (Sep-
tember 7—November 4), a retrospective of museum scientific illu-
strator Carolyn Barlett Gast’s drawings of fossils, insects, birds,
and invertebrates.

Photographic Portraits of North American Indians: A Re-
creation of the First Photographic Exhibition in the Smithsonian
Institution (May 28—December 31) consisted of some 259 portraits
of Native Americans, most of them members of official delegations
that visited Washington, D.C., from 1857 to 1869, from the col-
lections of the museum’s National Anthropological Archives. The
exhibition was organized by the archives’ Paula Fleming. For the
celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Gem Collec-
tion in 1984, curator John S. White placed on exhibition three
spectacular new gifts—the 182-carat “Star of Bombay” sapphire, a
bequest of film actress Mary Pickford; the 318-carat ‘Dark Jubi-
lee’ opal, donated by the Zale Corporation; and a 168-carat
emerald pendant, a bequest of Anna Chase Mackay, a former
Metropolitan Opera soprano.

In late 1983 the museum opened Fossils Galore: Life in the Early
Seas, a new highlight in its fossil exhibit complex. Fossils Galore
marks the beginning of the Paleozoic era, 600 million years ago,
when the first hard-shelled life appeared, followed by an astonish-
ing increase in the number and variety of fossilized animals. It
includes a display of the rare 530-million-year-old fossilized soft-
bodied animals of the Burgess Shale. One of the Smithsonian’s
greatest scientific finds, these fossils were discovered at a site in
British Columbia in 1910 by the Institution’s fourth secretary,
(1896-1927), geologist Charles D. Walcott. This marks the first

Science / 85
time that a large number of these curious specimens, which pro-
vide the best information we have on soft-bodied life in the early
Cambrian seas, have ever been exhibited. Paleobiology collections
manager Frederick J. Collier organized the exhibition.

OFFICE OF EDUCATION

The premiere performance of “The Beadle of Prague,” a dramatic
cantata commissioned in association with the exhibition The
Precious Legacy, was one of the many special presentations that
enlivened and added educational strength to Evans Gallery exhibi-
tions in 1983-84. A four-day festival, featuring dance perfor-
mances, film presentations, lectures, chefs’ demonstrations of
Chinese cuisine, and programs on calligraphy, kitemaking, paper
folding, brush paintings, and other traditional Chinese arts, was
presented to help late summer visitors appreciate the exhibition
Treasures from Shanghai. Fifty-six special docents were trained to
give group tours for Evans Gallery exhibitions, serving more than
13,000 persons. Teachers’ workshops were conducted to acquaint
instructors in area schools with the content of the exhibitions
Exploring Microspace and Treasures from Shanghai.

“Wandering Birds in the Southern Ocean,” by Dr. George Wat-
son; “Snorkling and Science in the Sea of Cortez,” by Dr. Mark
Littler; ‘“Native Writings of the Massachusetts Indians,” by Dr.
Ives Goddard; “Fossil Birds and the Polynesian Conquest of Na-
ture in the Pacific,” by Dr. Storrs Olson; “The Elusive Mud
Dragon and His Kin,” by Dr. Robert Higgins; and “Exploring
Microspace,” by Dr. Richard Benson were among the eleven slide-
illustrated lectures by museum curators on their research and field
work presented during 1983-84 in the regular free Friday Film
and Lecture Series. A special holiday film festival featuring out-
standing natural history films was presented during the Christmas-
New Year week.

The Discovery Room, which celebrated its tenth anniversary
with a week-long program of special events, was visited by more
than 100,000 persons in family and school groups during the year.
The Naturalist Center increased its hours, starting in April, dou-
bling its summer visitorship, and is now open seven days a week.
Workshops were held to inform high school teachers of the cen-
ter’s resources, significantly increasing student usage.

Two-hundred-and-eighty-one docents participated in the regular
school and public programs, providing services to 165,000 persons.

DEPARTMENT OF VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

New evidence that the hand of man may have had a greater respon-
sibility than is generally assumed for many extinctions of island
plant and animal communities in the past 10,000 years was pub-
lished in 1984 by Dr. Storrs Olson and Dr. David Steadman. With
colleague Dr. Gregory Pregill, of the San Diego Museum of Natural
History, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences on their fossil finds on Antigua, Lesser Antilles, where
they discovered a mass of accumulated fossils in a sediment-packed
limestone fissure. Radiocarbon dating brackets this material into a
period between 4,300 years ago, when the island’s first human set-
tlers arrived, and 2,560 years ago. Analysis of the fossil sample
showed 33 percent of the species to be extinct on Antigua—includ-
ing lizards, snakes, birds, bats, and rodents—which if extrapolated
to the total original biota would indicate that man may have eradi-
cated one-third of the island’s fauna.

Steadman, Pregill, and Olson concluded: “If Antigua is at all
representative, then the endemic or localized distributions that
characterize many insular species may actually be more a conse-
quence of recent habitat degradation than such factors as niche
partitioning and competition, which are now popularly assumed to
regulate the kind and even number of species on islands under
natural conditions.”

Many months of work by ichthyologist Dr. Victor Springer cul-
minated in early 1984 in the Smithsonian Institution Press publica-
tion of the hand-colored plates of one of the nineteenth century’s
most outstanding illustrated scientific classics—a monumental atlas
of Indo-Pacific fishes that is the masterwork of the great Dutch
ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker. Atlas Ichtyologique des Indes Orien-
tales Neerlandaises, Plates for Tomes XI-XIV (Atlas of Fishes of
the Dutch East Indies) contains 150 color plates of Indo-Pacific fish
fauna—including sharks, rays, blennies, gobies, siganids, and jacks
—the richest and most magnificent in the world. All profits from
the sale of this work go into the Leonard P. Schultz Fund, managed
by Springer and used for research, collection and purchase of fish
specimens, and exploration and publications relating to fish.

The museum’s Marine Mammal Salvage Program, designed to
recover data and specimens of marine mammals on the U.S. Atlan-
tic Coast that would otherwise be lost to science, has been in opera-
tion since 1972, and is yielding an enormous amount of data bear-
ing on migratory patterns, size, and distribution of populations,

Science / 87
and eating and breeding habits. After recovering an average of 50
to 100 or more stranded animals a year, with a high of 200 in 1977,
the stranding frequency fell into a puzzling lull from 1980 through
1983 with only five to ten recoveries each of these years. In Septem-
ber 1984 the lull ended with a sudden influx of strandings reported
on the coast of Virginia and North Carolina: an Antillean beaked
whale, only the fortieth ever reported in the scientific literature,
stranded at Bogue Banks, N.C.; three Risso’s dolphins came ashore
on Ocracoke Island, N.C.; and seven bottle-nosed dolphins strand-
ed in the Virginia Beach area. Program director Dr. James Mead
tentatively hypothesizes that the fluctuation in strandings can be
explained by changes in the distribution of marine mammals rela-
tive to onshore currents. Data on these strandings were reported in
the department’s U.S. Marine Mammal Stranding Report, issued
quarterly to the scientific community.

Gigantism and dwarfism provide fascinating opportunities for
the study of evolutionary patterns and mechanisms. Among the
three squirrels, “giants” occur in three different lineages on three
continents, and pygmy squirrels have similarly evolved indepen-
dently on three different continents. Mammalogist Dr. Richard
Thorington is attempting to understand what factors have caused
these squirrels to be large or small and how these size changes are
accomplished. Among his 1983-84 case studies were field reports
on the ecology, behavior, and anatomy of one of the largest tree
squirrels in the world, the Malabar squirrel of India, which weighs
four to five pounds, and the fox squirrels of the southeastern United
States, the largest tree squirrels in North America.

As part of his overall study, Thorington is looking into the origin
and significance of intriguing anatomical parallels between both the
pygmy and giant arboreal squirrels and primates. The objective is
to study cases in which evolution has repeatedly followed similar
paths, and to examine the developmental and ecological constraints
that may have led to such parallel evolution. Both the smallest
monkeys and smallest tree squirrels have some behavioral and bio-
logical similarities. Giant tree squirrels would seem to have little in
common with the giant ceboid monkeys of South America—the
spider and howling monkeys—yet they have parallel specializations
of the shoulder musculature, which suggests that allometry (factors
controlling the relative growth of a body part in proportion to the
entire body) places similar constraints on large squirrels and large
monkeys.

DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY

Because so little is known about the biology, natural relationships,
and distributions of a large percentage of the insect life in South
America’s vast tropical rain forests, National Museum of Natural
History entomologists go there as often as possible to collect speci-
mens. In January, February, and March 1984, they joined scientists
from throughout the world in the first detailed multidisciplinary
biological investigation of Cerro de la Neblina, one of the largest
and highest of the unexplored mesas (tepuis) in southern Vene-
zuela’s vast “Lost World” wilderness region. Rising 7,500 feet to a
forested plateau and then onward to a 10,000-foot-high cloud-
covered peak, Neblina, the “Mountain of the Mists,” is a remnant
of a vast eroded tableland that covered the region hundreds of mil-
lions of years ago. High vertical cliffs, deep canyons, and steep rock
slopes isolate the mountain’s high plateau and peak from the rain
forests that surround its base, creating an “island in the sky” en-
vironment where flora and fauna have evolved that do not exist
anywhere else on earth.

Airplane and helicopter support was provided for the expedition
by the sponsoring Venezuelan organization, the Foundation for
the Development of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences.
Expedition coordinator and leader Dr. Charles Brewer-Carias ar-
ranged to fly groups of scientists, including the Smithsonian’s Don-
ald Davis, Robert Robbins, Oliver Flint, Jerry Louton, and Vicki
Funk, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife scientists Roy McDiarmid and
Mercedes Foster, to San Carlos, a tiny military settlement on the
northern reaches of the Rio Negro, one of the major tributaries of
the Amazon. Loading their equipment into dugout canoes powered
by outboard motors, they were taken downriver to another outpost,
from which they were flown by helicopter across fifty miles of un-
broken, uninhabited rain forest to a base camp at the base of the
tepui.

From this site, collecting forays were made by scientists into
Neblina’s lowland forests and major river canyon. Davis, Louton,
Funk, McDiarmid, and Foster were among those taken by heli-
copter up to the wind- and rain-swept plateau where they set up
temporary camps and collected insects, plants, animals, and birds
in the scrub- and forest-covered boggy terrain. The plateau proved
as taxonomically enlightening as the scientists had hoped; a high
percentage of the plants and insects have structural peculiarities
reflecting their genetic isolation and sebsequent changes in form

90 / Smithsonian Year 1984
resulting from their isolated habitat. Tens of thousands of insects
were collected and are now being sorted and prepared for study.
The participation of U.S. scientists in the expedition was sponsored
by the Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Research Fund and the
National Science Foundation. Important assistance was provided by
the Institute of Tropical Zoology, Central University of Venezuela,
Caracas; the Institute of Agricultural Zoology, Central University
of Venezuela, Maracay; and the Venezuelan National Herbarium.
The exploration of Neblina is expected to continue into 1985.

At Tambopata, Peru, a wildlife reserve in the Amazon basin
lying within what many biologists believe is the richest forest
region in the world, Dr. Terry L. Erwin is studying the insect life
of the tropical forest canopy—one of the last unexplored biotic
frontiers on earth. In 1983-84 he completed four seasonal surveys
in the preserve, using an insecticidal fog to collect a million insect
specimens from the treetops of five different forest types within the
reserve. Erwin’s preliminary data show that 87 percent of the tropi-
cal-canopy insects are restricted to a specific forest type, and that
about 13 percent are confined to mostly one species of tree, a find-
ing that he believes has practical implications for the preservation
of tropical wildlife. He estimates that there are as many as 200
types of tropical forests, and to preserve the incredible diversity of
insect life they hold (possibly as many as 50 million species), as
many forest types as possible should be represented when reserves
are established—not just ones that make convenient picnic areas
for tourists. Working with Dr. Erwin, to help him document, gain
an understanding, and preserve the flora and fauna of this rich
region are scientists from the Smithsonian and other major institu-
tions in the United States, along with students and professors at
the Peruvian universities of La Molina and San Marcos in Lima and
from the universities at Callatena and Cuzco.

Among the other entomological collecting activities in South
America in 1983-84: coleopterist Dr. Paul J. Spangler brought back
more than 25,000 insects—including numerous new species—from
the Takutu Mountains of Guyana, an expedition sponsored by
EARTHWATCH; Dr. Johnathan Coddington collected arachnids and
myriapods in Venezuela and Trinidad; and Dr. Wayne Mathis
made a major collection of shore flies from Peru, Colombia, and
Belize.

DEPARTMENT OF PALEOBIOLOGY

Capitalizing on opportunities to make large documented collections
of fossils is an important priority for National Museum of Natural
History paleobiologists. At a huge open-pit mine on the south
bank of the Pamlico River, near Aurora, North Carolina, seventeen
years of collecting work led by the museum has established the
site as one of the richest known fossil deposits in the world, and
made possible the greatest single advancement ever in knowledge
of middle Atlantic Coastal Plain paleontology.

The first of three large volumes of research papers on the site
was published in September 1983 by the Smithsonian Institution
Press. Geology and Paleontology of Lee Creek Mine, North Caro-
lina (Smithsonian Contributions to Paleobiology, No. 53), edited
by Dr. Clayton E. Ray, contains fourteen papers on Lee Creek
geology and paleontology, and a biography by Dr. Frank C. Whit-
more, Jr., of the late Dr. Remington E. Kellogg, a marine mammal
authority and former director of the Smithsonian’s U.S. National
Museum, to whom the three volumes are to be dedicated. It was
Kellogg who initiated Smithsonian studies at the Texasgulf-owned
mine in 1967 after he received a small collection of vertebrate
fossils from geologist Jack E. McClellan.

Scientists have studied curious Middle Atlantic Coast vertebrate
fossils since colonial times, but before the Lee Creek Mine existed
there was no way to learn about deposits in the critically impor-
tant Miocene and Pliocene Yorktown and Pungo Formations in
North Carolina, except through limited information that could be
gleaned by drilling. Aware that the Lee Creek Mine presented a
research opportunity that must be exploited, Kellogg enlisted col-
leagues at the Smithsonian, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other
scientific institutions, asking them to look into Lee Creek material
pertaining to their specialties and to collect at the site. The result
was that a trickle of fossils soon became a torrent; the mine to
date has yielded one of the largest fossil sea bird faunas in the
world; a superb collection of true seals, as well as an abundance of
new and different species of whales; and a remarkable assemblage
of sharks and bony fish, extensive enough to be considered the
essential reference for reconstructing the history and development
of the modern Western Atlantic fish fauna.

Although no small amount of this material was gathered by
scientists, the single most important and productive collector at
the Lee Creek Mine for the Smithsonian over the past seventeen

92 / Smithsonian Year 1984
years has been Peter J. Harmatuk. For years, every weekend or
day off, Harmatuk drove the thirty miles from his home in Bridge-
ton, North Carolina, to Lee Creek, where he spent countless hours
roaming the piles of recently excavated dirt, looking for fossils. In
1975 he retired early from his successful career as a factory man-
ager so that he could pursue paleontological fieldwork for the
Smithsonian more intensively. Dr. Ray writes: “He has collected
with unflagging enthusiasm more fossils of more kinds for science
than anyone who has ever worked the middle Atlantic Coastal
Plain, discovering specimens unprecedented in kind, quantity, or
quality. If one ever needed a reminder that paleontology tradi-
tionally has been and remains largely a field science, the enjoy-
ment and advancement of which is open to everyman to the extent
of his ability, effort, and interest, Peter Harmatuk provides irre-
futable proof.”

Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, paleobiologist emeritus, was awarded the
Penrose Medal, the highest honor given to American geologists,
at Geological Society of America meetings in Indianapolis, in
October 1983. Cooper, in his fifty-fourth year at the museum was
cited for “being the world’s foremost expert on brachiopods; for
being an inspirational teacher to generations of young paleontolo-
gists, for building a national collection of brachiopods and other
invertebrate fossils that is unparalleled in the world and for apply-
ing his rich knowledge of fossil lore to the resolution of geological
enigmas.”

Research geologists Drs. Ian G. Macintyre and Kenneth M.
Towe continued their investigation into the thousands of projec-
tions—resembling stalactites—that coat the ceiling of a huge, un-
charted limestone marine cave off Belize, Central America. The
projections, caused by the extensive precipitation of magnesium
calcite, have no known counterpart in any other marine environ-
ment in the world. In 1983-84 experiments were carried out that
will assist in establishing the role that bacteria play in the origin
of the carbonate precipitations. Large schools of fish frequent the
cave opening, fifty feet below the sea surface, including sharks
that rest on the cave floor and on ledges in the ceiling. Macintyre
and Towe believe that these fishes and sharks release organic
wastes that upon decaying produce by-products that are respon-
sible for the precipitation.

DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY

The luxuriant coniferous forests, meadows, and alpine slopes of the
Altai Mountains in southwestern Siberia are similar in many ways
to the vegetation of the Rocky Mountains. Dr. Stanwyn G. Shetler
in mid-1983 took part in a joint Soviet-American botanical expedi-
tion that explored this region of Asia—traveling by horseback to
reach the most rugged mountainous areas. The trip is believed by
Dr. Thomas Elias of the New York Botanical Garden, the U.S.
Team leader, to be the most important field expedition American
botanists have made in the USSR in modern times. One of the ex-
pedition’s objectives in the Altai Mountains was to expore jointly
with Soviet botanists the relationship between the plants of these
central Asian mountains and the plants of the Rocky Mountain
region of North America. During the second half of the expedition,
the field party visited the western Sayan Mountains in the Tuvan
Autonomous Republic, a wilderness where American botanists had
never collected before and where they studied the resemblances be-
tween this region’s plants and those of Alaska and boreal North
America.

The expedition, organized by the Main Botanical Garden in
Moscow and the Central Siberian Botanical Garden, Novosibirsk,
was the eighth U.S. plant collection on Soviet territory under the
auspices of a special bilateral exchange program begun in 1976.
The U.S. botanists returned with about 5,000 specimens, repre-
senting 400-500 species, which were divided more or less equally
between the Smithsonian, the New York Botanical Garden, and
the University of Alaska. The material represents an invaluable
collection of Siberian plants that will now be available in North
America to all future workers. Shetler was able to collect speci-
mens of most of the species of bellflowers (family Campanulaceae)
native to southern Siberia, and these collections and observations
will contribute greatly to his ongoing studies of this plant family.

Dr. Dan H. Nicolson spent two months in the summer of 1984
in southwestern China (Yunnan Province) collecting plants as one
of four Americans on a Sino-American exchange program. The
group did most of its collecting in the Cang Shan mountain range
west of the ancient walled city of Dali, about 400 kilometers
west of Kunning, the capital of Yunnan, on the Burma Road. More
than 19,000 specimens were collected. All collections were divided
equally between China and the United States, the Smithsonian
receiving one-third of the U.S. duplicates. The flora involved (Sino

94 / Smithsonian Year 1984
(Himalayan) is the richest temperate flora in the world and is of
great interest, not only to scientists, but to horticulturists. Four
Chinese botanists are scheduled to come to America in 1985 as part
of the exchange program worked out between the Academia Sinica
and the National Science Foundation.

In other Chinese related research, the museum’s Dr. Thomas
Soderstrom is working with Dr. Julian Campbell of the University
of Kentucky on the classification of the complex bamboos of
Sichuan. It is in the wilds of Sichuan that the last surviving popu-
lation of giant pandas live—feeding on various bamboos. Both
scientists are trying to improve our general knowledge of these
Sino-Himalayan bamboos, so important to the survival of the giant
panda.

In 1983-84 the museum became one of six multinational spon-
soring organizations of a long-term project to produce a flora of
Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. Nearly a dozen museum
botanists—coordinated by Dr. Richard Cowan—will be involved.
The University of Utrecht, The Netherlands, will be the admin-
istrative center for the program. Other participants are the
Botanischer Garten and Museum, West Berlin; the New York
Botanical Garden; the Natural History Museum of Paris; and the
overseas research arm of the French Government.

Botanists Dr. Mark M. Littler, Diane Littler, Dr. James Norris,
and Katina Bucher made a surprising discovery in 1984 while sur-
veying the marine plant life off San Salvador Island, Bahamas, in
a research submersible with colleagues from the Harbor Branch
Foundation, Inc. Exploring an uncharted seamount at a depth of
880 feet, they found it covered with a calcareous form of red
algae, establishing a new maximum depth record for photosyn-
thetic plant life on earth. In the past it was thought that light
penetration in the ocean was insufficient for sustainable plant
growth below 100 fathoms (600 feet). The discovery indicates
that the role of macroalgae in deep-water oceanographic processes
is much greater than previously believed.

DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY

The oral traditions of the older Mayan men and women who live
in Chiapas, Mexico, are being lost as elderly people carry their
knowledge to the grave. Many of the younger Mayans are literate
in Spanish—but increasingly ignorant of their ancient culture.
After Indian participants in a 1982 anthropology conference at

Science / 95
San Cristobal, Chiapas, expressed concern over this loss, ethnolo-
gist Dr. Robert Laughlin began organizing and overseeing a
writer’s cooperative dedicated to preserving Mayan Indian culture.
The “House of Writers” is composed of six members, represent-
ing the Tzotzil towns of Chamula and Zinacantan, and the Tzeltal
towns of Oxchuc and Tenejapa. Laughlin, who for many years
has studied Mayan civilization and is the author of a dictionary
of Tzotzil, a language spoken by more than 200,000 Mayan
Indians, prepared alphabets in Tzotzil and Tzeltal for use by the
group and edited the first five bilingual illustrated booklets of
history and folklore published by the cooperative in 1983-84 at
the State of Chiapas Press. The books are now being distributed
in the communities. The project has the backing of Mexico’s
National Indian Institute.

The museum’s Human Studies Film Archives, the only national
organization dedicated to collecting and preserving motion picture
and video documentation of world culture, now has 1.5 million
feet of footage, including some of the most important anthropo-
logical film collections formerly in private hands. In 1983-84 alone,
the archives received in trust more than 900,000 feet of film, in-
cluding John Marshall’s substantive documentation of the Kung
bushmen of southern Africa, footage of the Yanomamo Indians
of Venezuela and Brazil by Timothy Asch and Napoleon Chagnon,
and Allison and Marek Jablonko’s research films of the Maring
people of the Papua New Guinea highlands.

Arctic, volume 5 of the Handbook of North American Indians,
was published in January 1985. The sixth volume in the series
to be completed, it describes the Arctic people and all Eskimo
groups from Siberia to Greenland. Research and editing on the
Great Basin (volume 11) are underway. All Handbook volumes
are in print, with more than 55,000 copies sold. The series is under
the general editorship of William C. Sturtevant.

Dr. Herman Viola, director of the museum’s National Anthro-
pological Archives, produced a lavishly illustrated overview of the
treasures of The National Archives of the United States, in honor
of the National Archives’ fiftieth anniversary. Dr. William Trous-
dale, curator of Far Eastern Archeology, edited an English memoir
of nineteenth-century Afghanistan that provides a valuable chron-
ical of the political events of the time as well as interesting infor-
mation on Afghan archeology, history, and industry. Drawing
heavily on the museum’s Tibetan collections, Dr. Paul Taylor,
curator of Asian Ethnology, organized an exhibition for the Smith-

96 / Smithsonian Year 1984
sonian’s Renwick Gallery celebrating the Tibetan Yak. This animal
occupies a central position in Tibetan life—somewhat as the bison
did for America’s Plains Indians—not only as a source of meat and
milk protein and of wool, hide, and horn for tents, clothing, and
utensils, but also as the pack animal on which the country’s trade
depends. Taylor was also instrumental in the acquisition of the
large private library of the late Professor John M. Echols, an
authority on Indonesian languages and developer of Cornell Uni-
versity’s Southeast Asian Studies program. This single purchase
helps fill in a serious gap in Smithsonian Asian Ethnology library
resources.

Major new archeological excavations were undertaken in 1983-
84 by Dr. Dennis Stanford at the classic Clovis paleoIndian arche-
ological site at Blackwater Draw in eastern New Mexico. Core
samples taken in 1983 determined that the site had not been com-
pletely destroyed, as feared, by twenty years of commercial gravel
mining in the area; extensive Clovis, Folsom, Agate Basin, and
Cody archeological deposits remain and are now being explored
by Stanford and geologist Vance Haynes (University of Arizona)
and other experts in the field of paleontology, palynology, and
soil analysis.

Two months of archeological surveys in Labrador in 1983-84
by Dr. William C. Fitzhugh provided a much clearer picture of
how early Maritime Archaic peoples lived. Evidence of early
single-family round or oval pithouses dug into boulder beaches
were found by Fitzhugh on the islands of Aillik, Big Bay, Natsa-
tuk, Karl Oom, Immilikuluk, and other locations. Excavation of
several of these sites produced diagnostic implements and radio-
carbon samples that should provide keys to the early develop-
mental sequence of this period (ca. 6500-4500 BP).

Dr. Gus Van Beek returned for the eleventh year to Tell
Jemmeh, in Israel’s western Negev Desert, where he excavated two
areas representing a crucial but unknown period in Philistine cul-
ture history (tenth to ninth century B.C.), recovering a fine series
of burnished red slip pottery that came from four successive
occupation periods and that should make it possible to trace the
development of pottery forms and decorative techniques during
this century.

Physical anthropologist Dr. Donald J. Ortner in July 1984 began
a detailed and comprehensive study of 300 bone specimens in the
museum’s human skeletal collections that exhibit pathological con-
ditions of special significance. The three-year study, supported by

Science / 97
a National Institutes of Health grant, is expected to shed light on
the origins and development of disease—and its relations to en-
vironmental and cultural factors—both of which remain important
in the treatment of disease today.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL SCIENCES

Over the past fifteen years the scattered fragments of possibly as
many as 1,000 meteorites, preserved in the Antarctic polar ice cap
for as long as 34 million years, have been found by U.S. and
Japanese expeditions. This amazing scientific bonanza amounts to
more than 25 percent of the total number of meteorites collected
on earth in the past 200 years. Drs. Brian Mason and Roy S.
Clarke have been charged for the past eight years with the respon-
sibility of characterizing and describing the largest portion of the
U.S. Antarctic material. Mason, a specialist in the mineralogy of
chondrite and achondrite meteorites, the types mostly found in
Antarctica, in 1983-84 published in the Antarctic Meteorite News-
letter descriptions of 151 specimens, including several distinctively
new and unusual mineralogical types. Clarke, a specialist in the
much more scarce iron meteorites, published on three new speci-
mens. This basic analytical work is opening up new vistas of
knowledge on the composition of parent meteoritic bodies, and
laying the groundwork for other important discoveries. For ex-
ample, scientists now believe there is evidence that the flux of
meteoritic types received by the earth may have changed over geo-
logic times. Some of the meteoritic material under study by Mason
and Clarke was found by Dr. Robert Fudali, who has accompanied
two recent National Science Foundation-funded U.S. expeditions
to Antarctica. On last year’s trip Fudali and six other scientists
logged more than 800 miles on snowmobiles during forty-two
days at remote stations on the polar plateau west of the Trans-
antarctic mountains, collecting more than 300 meteorites and me-
teorite fragments, including several rare carbonaceous chondrites.

Dr. Kurt Fredriksson is interested in developing more sensitive
equipment for quantifying chondrite meteorite trace element con-
tent and ratios. Collaborating with a group of scientists working
at the Max Planck Institute, Mainz, West Germany, in 1983-84,
he worked out an ion probe technique for this purpose that is
more sensitive than standard electron microprobe analysis. Fred-
riksson presented his findings at the 9th Symposium on Antarctic
Meteorites in Tokyo.

98 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Museum volcanologists in 1983-84 carried on research focusing
on various aspects of global volcanism. In his quest to understand
how volcanoes develop and grow, Dr. Tom Simkin is looking at
submerged seafloor volcanoes, which are many times more numer-
ous than those above sea level. Diving in the research submersible
Alvin, at depths of 1 to 3 kilometers in June 1984, Simkin investi-
gated several young volcanoes on the Pacific floor with shapes
similar to the Galapagos Islands volcanoes, 1500 kilometers to the
south, that he has studied for years. These volcano shapes, al-
though uncommon among oceanic islands, are now being recog-
nized in many detailed seafloor studies, and Simkin’s dives pro-
duced evidence that they form in much the same way as their
Galapagos equivalents.

Dr. Richard Fiske, director of the National Museum of Natural
History, is involved in a long-term project at the Soufriere volcano
of St. Vincent, British West Indies, which erupted violently in
1979, and is expected to erupt again before the end of this cen-
tury. In June 1974 Fiske and his colleagues installed a new “tilt”
station on the southwestern slopes of the volcano that will make it
possible to determine with reasonable precision the location of
swelling caused by subterranean lava surges. The project objective
is to develop an inexpensive, low-tech monitoring system that can
be used by Third World nations to determine when potentially
dangerous volcanoes will erupt.

Arenal, a highly explosive Costa Rican volcano, has been under
study by Dr. William Melson since its last major eruption in 1961.
Last year Melson started fieldwork on an intensive combined
volcanological and archeologic study of Arenal Volcano’s tephra
apron. The work has revealed that Arenal’s first major explosive
eruption occurred about 1000 B.C. Repeatedly, the region was re-
inhabited by Indians, and the study is making it possible to pre-
pare a remarkably precise chronology of their cultural changes
from the frequent catastrophic burial of habitation sites. This work
is being carried out with Payson Sheets, University of Colorado
at Boulder, and, in addition to Smithsonian funding, it has received
support from the National Science Foundation and National Geo-
graphic Society.

Krakatau 1883: The Volcanic Eruption and Its Effects was pub-
lished in December 1983 by the Smithsonian Institution Press.
Volcanologists Tom Simkin and Richard Fiske, coauthors with
Sarah F. Melcher and Elizabeth Nielsen, in 1983-84 gave more
than a dozen Krakatau talks to both scientific and lay audiences

Science / 99
in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Holland. The great inter-
est in the eruption—the most famous volcanic catastrophe in re-
corded history—was also evident in the extraordinarily rapid sales

of the book.

DEPARTMENT OF INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Concern over the high prevalence of cancer in fish living in chem-
ically contaminated bodies of water, and the potential human
health hazard posed by consuming these fish, using the water, or
being associated with production of the polluting chemicals, fo-
cused attention in 1983-84 on the museum’s Registry of Tumors
in Lower Animals. The registry, created and funded by the Na-
tional Cancer Institute, has for eighteen years been the only clear-
ing house in the world for information on the phenomena of
cancer in fish and other vertebrate and invertebrate coldblooded
animals.

Working out of an office and laboratory in the Department of
Invertebrate Zoology, director John Harshbarger and his staff
maintain a specimen depository of more than 5,000 specimens
from the United States and forty other countries. Every week, new
material arrives for examination. In the past year, Harshbarger
studied, diagnosed, and described 450 cases of disease. Reports of
these diagnostic studies were entered into the registry’s com-
puterized databank and circulated to scientists throughout the
world. Among the cases Harshbarger studied last year with various
collaborators were tumors in the liver and other organs of a feral
population of sauger and walleye fishes inhabiting Torch Lake in
Michigan, which is heavily polluted by chemicals and residues of
copper mining; liver and skin cancer in brown bullhead catfish
from the industrially polluted Black River, Ohio; and liver cancer
in tomcod fish from the Hudson River. Testifying in October at a
congressional subcommittee hearing on the growing incidence of
tumors and cancers in polluted waterways, Harshbarger recom-
mended the initiation of systematic and regular surveys of fish
populations in waterways throughout the nation to help locate
dangerous sources of pollution so that sport fishermen and con-
sumers will be able to determine if the fish and shellfish they
catch, buy, and consume come from contaminated areas.

Spectacular video footage documenting never-before-seen be-
havior patterns of deep-water echinoderms was compiled in April
1984 by the museum’s Dr. David Pawson, Dr. Porter Kier, and

100 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Dr. Gordon Hendler, and Dr. John Miller of the Harbor Branch
Foundation, Inc. In the third in a series of dives carried out by the
four scientists over the last year off the Bahama Islands in the
Harbor Branch research submersible, Johnson-Sea-Link-II, descents
were made as deep as several thousand feet along the sometimes
steep underwater slopes, to investigate the deepwater echinoderm
fauna—starfish, sea urchins, brittlestars, basketstars, sea cucum-
bers, feather stars, and sea lillies. The rich, diverse echinoderm
fauna in this area has never been explored firsthand until now,
although scientists have long known about the animals living
there, as a result of collections made more than a century ago with
the help of dredges. The dredges, however, often brought up dead,
damaged specimens, which gave little information on the animals’
delicate structures, behavior, or lifestyle. But the highly mobile
Harbor Branch submersible, outfitted with sophisticated collecting
equipment, can pluck animals from the rugged sea floor slopes
and bring them back alive in nearly pristine condition. Eighteen
dives were made on the April cruise, each lasting about three to
five hours.

Approximately eighty species of echinoderms—500 specimens
in all—were collected; at least twenty of these new to the scien-
tists’ survey list. To date, the Bahamas survey has yielded nearly
120 deepwater species, some new to science, and thousands of new
specimens for Smithsonian and Harbor Branch collections. In addi-
tion, hours of color videotape footage and hundreds of still photo-
graphs were shot. Detailed analysis of the specimens and film is
now in progress.

SMITHSONIAN OCEANOGRAPHIC SORTING CENTER

Several major collections of plankton were received in 1983-84
from the western North Atlantic, northern Caribbean, and the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, and interesting collections of fishes and
benthic invertebrates were also taken from the Gulf of Alaska
and the Caribbean. During the year the sosc staff prepared 135
shipments containing 51,916 specimens for shipment to sixty-three
specialists and to five permanent repositories. Staff research proj-
ects included Dr. Frank Ferrari’s work at the California Depart-
ment of Fish and Game’s Laboratory in Stockton, studying a
small copepod accidentally introduced from the Yangtze River
delta in China into the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta in Califor-
nia; and Dr. Gordon Hendler’s series of experiments at Carrie Bow
Cay concerning the ability of brittlestars to change color.

SMITHSONIAN MARINE STATION AT LINK PORT

Numerous scientists from various organizations of the Smith-
sonian, joined by colleagues from other institutions, visited the
museum’s Marine Station at Link Port, near Ft. Pierce, Florida, in
1983-84 to conduct research on a wide variety of topics in marine
sciences—from sedimentology and the spectral quality of under-
water light to systematic, ecological, reproductive, and behavioral
studies. The museum’s Dr. Robert P. Higgins and Dr. Reinhardt
Kristensen, a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow affiliated with the
University of Copenhagen, carried out a dredging and coring sur-
vey of the meiofauna living in the sediments of a ten-square-mile
area off the coast of Ft. Pierce at depths of ten to fifteen meters.
Both scientists are authorities on the systematics and life histories
of meiofauna—diminutive multicellular organisms adapted to liv-
ing in spaces between grains of sediment and sand on ocean floors
and beaches. The fact that these organisms represent a relatively
unexplored biological frontier was underscored in October 1984
when Kristensen announced the discovery and description of a
new meiofaunal phylum—Loricifera. It was only the third time in
this century that a new phylum has been added to the animal
kingdom, bringing to thirty-nine the total of these high-level
classification groups.

Loricifera—less than one-hundredth of an inch in length—is
distinguished from the four other meiofauna phylum by a mouth
apparatus that consists of a flexible tube that can be telescopically
retracted into the animal. It also has clawlike and clubshaped
spines on its head that help keep it firmly attached to the sedi-
ment. Kristensen has documented the animal group in sea-bottom
samples from waters off France, Greenland, the South Pacific, and
the Atlantic coast of the United States. At Link Port he and
Higgins collected a wide range of meiofauna, including larval and
molting loriciferan specimens that yielded significant new informa-
tion on the life histories of this recently recognized phylum.

Among the other studies in 1983-84 were research on gastropod
systematics by the museum’s Richard S. Houbrick; a study of the
reproductive biology of brooding ophiuroids by Dr. Maria Byrne,
a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow; and an investigation of the life
history of the rock boring barnacles by Joseph Dineen, a Univer-
sity of Maryland graduate student. Dr. Judith Winston, American
Museum of Natural History, and Dr. Eckart Hakansson, Univer-
sity of Copenhagen, continued their study of the life histories and

population ecology of two free-living species of bryozoans. Elec-
trophoretic enzyme studies by the museum’s Dr. Kristian Fauchald
on a species of polychaete from both sides of the Florida peninsula
demonstrated apparent inherent differences in morphologically ex-
tremely similar populations. The museum’s Dr. Raymond B. Man-
ning and Darryl L. Felder, of the University of Southwestern
Louisiana, conducted a study of parasitic peacrabs (pinnotherids),
which live in burrows of mud shrimps (pinnotherids). Dr. Anson
Hines, of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, studied
the growth patterns of four xanthid crabs that differ in size at
maturity.

A study of the behavior of amphipods by the museum’s Dr.
J. L. Barnard and James D. Thomas, of the Newfound Harbor
Marine Institute, stressed the function of appendages, individually
and cooperatively in performing such tasks as tube building,
grooming, and feeding and in inter- and intraspecific confronta-
tions. With the help of time-lapse photography, supervised by
Kjell Sandved, the museum’s scientific photographer, the tube-
building behavior of two amphipod species was documented with
special attention to the production and manipulation of silk strands
by the appendages to form the tubes.

MUSEUM SUPPORT CENTER

The first full year of operation of the Museum Support Center
(msc) has been marked by the staffing of key positions, the im-
plementation of special policy procedures governing pest control
and inventory management, the installation of a sophisticated
electronic security system, and the first phase of construction of
the collection storage equipment. In addition, the initial move of
both people and collections into the center took place. The Na-
tional Museum of American History was the first to formally
take occupation of assigned space, bringing in the first collection
object, a harpsichord, for conservation treatment. Next, the Con-
servation Analytical Laboratory moved to the Support Center,
vacating its former quarters in the Museum of American History.
Subsequently, the National Museum of Natural History established
its botany plant-mounting lab, paleobiology sedimentology lab,
and vertebrate zoology histology lab at msc. An acarologist asso-
ciated with the National Institutes of Health and working in affili-
ation with the museum’s Department of Entomology has moved
his entire lab, including his scanning electron microscope and his

104 / Smithsonian Year 1984
significant reference collection of ticks, from Montana into the
center.

Until permanent storage systems are completed, msc has been
able to provide limited temporary storage for collection materials
from Natural History, as well as special space for use by the
Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Service and the Museum of
African Art. Preparations are currently underway to accommodate
the needs of the new Sackler Gallery and the Center for Asian
Art, which will use space at msc loaned to them by the Depart-
ment of Anthropology until the new Quadrangle building is ready.
The Support Center was honored in a local competition sponsored
by the regional power companies for being one of the best de-
signed and constructed new buildings in the area as regards energy
efficiency.

National Zoological Park

In fiscal year 1984 the National Zoological Park (Nzr) continued
its commitment to education, science, recreation, and conservation
through animal exhibits, symposia, publications, research with the
collection, and research and breeding of endangered species. These
programs were accomplished through the combined efforts of the
Office of Animal Programs, the Office of Support Services, and the
Office of the Director.

ANIMAL COLLECTION AND EXHIBITS

There were many notable changes in the animal collection of the
National Zoological Park, including significant births and deaths
as well as major acquisitions. In late November 1983, Ling-Ling,
the female giant panda, was critically ill with a serious kidney
infection with associated anemia. After successful treatment by the
veterinary staff, Ling-Ling’s condition improved so dramatically
that she had a normal heat cycle in the spring. On March 19, 1984,
Ling-Ling mated twice with Hsing-Hsing and became pregnant.
After a gestation period of 139 days, she gave birth, but her cub,
a male weighing 5.3 ounces, was stillborn, as a result of a bacterial
infection.

Many of the rare and endangered species maintained by the
National Zoological Park produced offspring during this period.
The second spectacled bear cub was born and the Cuban croco-

Science / 105
diles laid twenty-nine eggs, many of which hatched, for the first
time at the National Zoo. The first pygmy hippo in seven years
was born. There were also births to the grey seals, sea lions, golden
lion tamarins, maned wolves, scimitar-horned oryx, Pére David's
deer, titi monkeys, red pandas and Goeldi’s monkeys. Several es-
tablished breeding programs of the departments of Ornithology
and Herpetology continued with hatchings by Ruddy ducks, Lay-
san teal, white-winged wood ducks, white-naped cranes, Stanley’s
cranes, rufous beaked snakes, giant day and leopard gekkos, and
red-footed and leopard tortoises. A total of 1,233 births and
hatchings were recorded for calendar year 1983 by the National
Zoo, which ended that year with 2,932 animals in its collection.

The major animal acquisition in fiscal year 1984 was an infant
Asiatic elephant presented to President Reagan on June 18, by
the president of Sri Lanka. The elephant, named Jayathu, was a
Zoo favorite, with a personality that charmed many zoogoers. Un-
fortunately, she contracted a serious digestive problem and died
on August 30, despite massive efforts by the veterinary and keeper
staff. Other significant acquisitions included black palm cockatoos
from Malaysia, birds of paradise from New Guinea and green-
winged macaws. Two new research projects were initiated on
species completely new to the National Zoo’s collection. In col-
laboration with the Duke Primate Center, the National Zoo suc-
cessfully reproduced western tarsiers, acquired from Malaysia, for
the first time. Tarsiers have been little maintained or exhibited in
zoos because of their delicate and noctural nature. Field studies
are to be conducted on behavioral ecology in order to develop a
more comprehensive understanding of the biology of tarsiers.

Dr. Eugene Morton traveled to Guam and returned with four
Guam rails, a species disappearing from the island with astonish-
ing rapidity. In spearheading an attempt to breed Guam rails in
captivity, Dr. Morton hopes that the decline of the species on
Guam can be reversed and that captive-bred rails can be reintro-
duced to the island. Eggs have already been laid and hatched by
this endangered species. Many other bird species on Guam are
endangered as well, and nzp will also be participating in a captive-
breeding program for the Guam kingfisher.

Several other staff members are deeply involved in national and
international captive-breeding programs for endangered species,
including Dr. Katherine Ralls and Jonathan Ballou, who represent
the National Zoo on the 1ucn’s Survival Service Commission’s Cap-
tive Breeding Specialist Group. Dr. Devra Kleiman and Ballou

maintain the International Studbook for Golden Lion Tamarins,
while Scott Derrickson has become nzp’s representative for the
Bali Mynah Propagation Group, with Guy Greenwell as special
advisor in management. Nzp is deeply involved in formulating
plans to reintroduce the Bali mynah to Indonesia, using captive-
bred stock. Other Species Survival Plan programs underway in-
clude those for gorilla, black rhino, and Indian rhino.

The animal inventory is in the process of being completely com-
puterized, which will ease nzp’s ability to maintain records and
retrieve information. Currently, all bird transactions are recorded
directly into the computer; ultimately, nzp hopes to be able to
communicate directly with the International Species Inventory
System (isis) in Minnesota through the Smithsonian computer
systems.

The outdoor furniture in the giant panda yards was completely
replaced in a unique effort that involved nzp staff and more than
400 volunteers from the Friends of the National Zoo. Included in
this building effort were swings, platforms, feeding trees, tires,
and other wooden sections designed to encourage greater activity
in the giant pandas.

The Department of Animal Health (pau) continues to strive for
furthering veterinary care of the animal collection at both Rock
Creek Park and the Conservation and Research Center (crc) in
Front Royal, Virginia. The clinical staff participates in research
and development of techniques; conducts postgraduate training;
publishes extensively; and attends and leads continuing educa-
tion—all in an effort to further zoological medicine.

International involvement is exemplified by the participation of
Drs. Mitchell Bush and David Wildt in reproductive and im-
mobilization studies in South Africa; presentations at international
scientific meetings; and involvement in ongoing field studies such
as the Golden Lion Tamarin Project in Brazil.

Reproductive research continues in endocrinology and the de-
velopment of techniques in the areas of semen and embryo collec-
tion, transfer, and cryopreservation. These programs are conducted
by Dr. Wildt and his graduate students in collaboration with the
National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and
the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences.

Ongoing clinical research, intended to be directly applicable to
veterinary care, includes studies of Mycobacterium ssp. in hoof-
stock, rabies prophylaxis and vaccination response in nearly all
species of mammals, monoclonal killed canine distemper vaccines,

108 / Smithsonian Year 1984
appropriate anthelmintics for reptilian parasites, and adrenal re-
sponse to immobilization and surgical manipulation in selected
primate, ungulate, and carnivore species.

Veterinary facilities at crc are under construction to provide that
facility with a fully equipped animal hospital to provide surgical,
hospitalization, and clinical laboratory support for that portion of
the animal collection.

The computerization of the DAH medical records is proving in-
valuable in maintaining medical histories of individual animals,
allowing retrospective studies of health conditions, and providing
a monitor for preventative health care for the entire collection.

The Department of Pathology actively engages in applied re-
search and teaching as important spinoffs of the diagnostic ser-
vices that are provided to the zoo collection. Research centers
around the disease problems that exist in the collection, with
emphasis on the development of prophylactic measures against
infectious diseases and parasites that affect the animals.

This department maintains a very active residency program,
teaching pathology of zoo animals as a unique specialty at the
postgraduate level to veterinary pathology residents from the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and to an in-house pathology
resident as well as instructors from various veterinary colleges.

Research, supported by the Charles Ulrich and Josephine Bay
Foundation, through the American Association of Zoo Veterinar-
ians, to study viral diseases in zoo animals, has continued to be
most productive. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
and the Department of Animal Health have collaborated with us
in studies that have led to new information about the use of
canine distemper, parvovirus and rabies vaccine in certain zoo
animals. Nzp has also continued collaborative research of the rac-
coon rabies epizootic that has occurred in the southern and middle
Atlantic states and has engaged in joint studies concerned with
epizootiologic aspects with the National Park Service, the Univer-
sity of the District of Columbia, and the Centers for Disease Con-
trol. Information from more than three years of monitoring the
epizootic as it moved from Northern Virginia to Washington,
D.C., was presented at the North American Symposium on Rabies
in Wildlife, held at Johns Hopkins University in the fall of 1983.

Another ongoing project has been studying the effect of intra-
venous avian tuberculin on the hemogram of tuberculous and non-
tuberculous quail (Coturnix coturnix), which was funded by the
Friends of the National Zoo (FoNz).

Science / 109
Pasteurella multocida has been identified as the cause of an out-
break of septicemic deaths in southern potoroos (Potorous api-
calis), in which the organisms acted as an opportunist during peri-
ods of stress associated with aggression in the potoroo colony.
The syndrome resembled pasteurellosis of rabbits in which the
pasteurella organism is introduced by a carrier animal and becomes
overt during stressful periods.

New projects include iron metabolism studies in rock hyrax
(Procavia capensis) with hemachromatosis, and its possible asso-
ciation with gastric grassanemiasis, and the identification and
epizootiologic aspects of equine herpes virus (EHv-1) that was
recovered from an aborted onager (Equus hemionus onager) fetus
and implicated in a neurologic syndrome of a yearling zebra
(Equus burchelli). A retrospective study of sera that had been
banked from various equidae at Rock Creek Park and Front Royal
indicated exposure of most of the zebras to EHv-1 at both sites as
early as two years prior to the abortion. There were, however, no
recognizable clinical signs such as the upper respiratory infections
that occur frequently in domestic horses in any of the zebras or
onagers. The herpes virus isolated from the onager fetus was
identified as a unique subtype by virologists at the University of
Kentucky, Lexington, and is being further studied.

Dr. Richard J. Montali attended an international symposium on
the diseases of zoo animals in Brno, Czechoslovakia, and delivered
a paper on reproductive strategies in zoo animals coauthored with
Drs. Wildt and Bush of the Department of Animal Health. Dr.
Montali also attended the Primate Pathology Workshop in San
Francisco and presented a paper on special disease problems in
folivorous monkeys and their implication on the management of
these highly specialized primates in captivity. He lectured on gross
lesions of zoo animals at a C. L. Davis Foundation for Veterinary
Pathology session and presented a four-hour seminar at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control in Atlanta on the pathology of zoo
animals.

RESEARCH

There were a variety of continuing and new research projects at
the National Zoo. One of the more exciting involved the rehabili-
tation and training of captive-born golden lion tamarins prior to
their reintroduction in the Poco das Antas Reserve in Brazil. Dr.
Devra Kleiman accompanied fifteen golden lion tamarins to the
Rio de Janeiro Primate Center in November 1983. Both before and

110 / Smithsonian Year 1984
after their arrival in Brazil, Dr. Benjamin Beck, Dr. Kleiman, and
several Brazilian students worked with these animals to train
them in techniques of foraging for, finding, and exposing new
foods. At the same time, Dr. James Dietz has been working on
the behavioral ecology of wild golden lion tamarins in Brazil in
order to determine their feeding habits, home range and move-
ments, and social organization. As part of the Golden Lion Tam-
arin Reintroduction Project, Lou Ann Dietz has been coordinating
a local and national educational program in Brazil concerning con-
servation of golden lion tamarins.

Dr. Rudy Rudran held another successful wildlife management
training course at the crc with students from Peru, Sri Lanka,
China, Nigeria, and Malaysia. Dr. Rudran also conducted wildlife
management training courses in Brazil and visited Argentina and
Venezuela to follow up on previous studies. Dr. Morton continued
his research program on the evoluation of animal vocal communi-
cation, welcoming Eyal Shy from the Edward Grey Institute in
Oxford to initiate a research project on the function of bird song.
He has initiated a major work on the evolution of animal com-
munication in collaboration with Kimberly Young. Dr. Morton and
Dr. Russell Greenberg continued collaborative studies on the de-
velopment of feeding behavior in migratory warblers, relating the
differences in behavioral development in species to their feeding
adaptations as adults.

Dr. Katherine Ralls continued her studies of sea otter behavioral
ecology and held a workshop on the Genetic Management of
Captive Populations at Front Royal, assisted by population man-
ager Jonathan Ballou. Lisa Forman initiated studies on the genetics
of golden lion tamarins and dorcas gazelle, in collaboration with
Dr. Stephen O’Brien at the National Institutes of Health genetics
laboratory. These will be the first studies in which pedigrees of
known captive populations are compared with the actual degree of
biochemical heterozygosity.

Dr. Steven Thompson joined the National Zoo as a postdoctoral
fellow to initiate studies of the comparative energetics of eutherian
and marsupial mammals, with a National Science Foundation grant
and a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellowship. He will be collaborat-
ing with Dr. Martin Nicoll, a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Edwin
Gould, concerned with the behavioral ecology and metabolic rates
of conservative mammals such as tenrecs. The research will focus
on the changes in the metabolism of marsupials and eutherian
mammals during the course of the reproductive cycle.

Science / 111
Dr. John Gittleman, postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Kleiman, con-
tinued his work on red panda development and vocalizations. He
also collaborated with Dr. Olav Oftedal in a study of behavioral
development and lactation in black bears, conducted on wild black
bears in Pennsylvania. Dr. Oftedal and Dr. Daryl Boness con-
tinued fruitful collaborations, with work on the hooded seal lacta-
tion and milk composition being initiated on the ice floes off the
southeastern coast of Labrador. They have discovered that hooded
seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal. They also
continued their long-term studies of behavioral development and
lactation in the California sea lion in California, with the assis-
tance of Dr. Katherine Ono. Mary Allen continued her studies
of insect-eating animals and captive diets.

Dr. John Seidensticker continued the Field Studies Programs
at CRC, concentrating on the dispersal and foraging behavior of
raccoons, in collaboration with Dr. James Hallett and Dr. Margaret
O’Connell. Theodore Grand expanded his studies of functional
morphology of mammals with a comparison of the morphology
of several ungulate species as it relates to their ecology.

The animal collection of the Department of Zoological Research
was involved in several programs, including studies of marsupial
and eutherian energetics and also of the basic reproductive biology
and management of several little-known forms. Miles Roberts and
the keeper staff completed several papers for publication, one of
them on the captive reproduction and management of the little
known rock cavy.

Fred Koontz completed his University of Maryland Ph.D. thesis
on the behavior of captive elephant shrews. Susan Lumpkin and
Devra Kleiman initiated a project to develop a series of books on
the Management of Wild Mammals in Captivity, to be published
by the University of Chicago Press.

Dr. Gould continued his analysis of regurgitation in gorillas
and stereotyped behaviors in zoo animals; he also visited Malaysia
to initiate field studies there. Dr. Wolfgang Dittus and Anne
Baker-Dittus continued their long-term study of the Tocque ma-
caques of Sri Lanka; she is concentrating on behavioral develop-
ment and differential maternal investment and he is concentrating
on long-term demographic data for this uniquely well-known
population as well as on their social structure and communication
patterns.

Dr. Dale Marcellini and Tom Jenssen continued collaborative
work on lizard behavioral ecology in the Caribbean area, looking

petition. Dr. Christen Wemmer traveled to Asia to pursue his
studies of the morphology and breeding of captive elephants, while
developing the Smithsonian research program in Nepal, deriving
from the long-term tiger studies. Dr. Wemmer has also been con-
tinuing his interest in the behavior and ecology of the Cervidae,
and Dr. Michael Stuwe is conducting in-depth studies of the
behavior of white-tailed deer at crc.

CONSERVATION

Four American zoos (National, Los Angeles, New York, and San
Diego) are attempting to develop a cooperative project with the
Wildlife Department of Sabah, East Malaysia, for the captive
propagation, as well as field research and protection, of proboscis
monkeys. Dr. Gould is serving as the project coordinator. An im-
portant part of the project will be to help Sabah develop a propa-
gation center for proboscis monkeys and eventually a wildlife park
at the Sepilok Orang Sanctuary near Sandakan.

The National Zoo joined the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums (aazPA) consortium to save the Sumatran
rhino. Dr. John Frazier went to India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldive
Islands to survey turtle-nesting areas as part of the marine turtle
conservation program. Dr. Seidensticker was a consultant for the
World Bank in developing guidelines for elephant conservation
within the context of major agricultural and forestry development
projects. The National Zoo received a grant from Resources for
the Future to assess the impact of habitat change on indigenous
wildlife populations at the Conservation and Research Center.
Dr. Rudran conducted a seven-week Wildlife Conservation and
Management Training course at crc, where thirteen biologists
from developing nations took part.

Prior to the summer course, Dr. Rudran conducted wildlife con-
servation courses for fourteen students in Brazil and nine students
in Venezuela, and supervised field projects in Argentina that were
initiated in 1982.

Drs. Ralls and Siniff received a grant to study the ecology, be-
havior, and conservation of California sea otters. In Nepal, Smith-
sonian conservation efforts have broadened from the former tiger
project to include a more inclusive study of the terai ecosystem.
Dr. Wemmer is senior research coordinator for the new Smith-
sonian Institution Nepal Terai Ecology Project. In 1984, Drs.

114 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Mishra and Dinerstein initiated research on the effects of fire and
mammalian herbivores on terai forest succession. In December
1983 Drs. Robinson, Wemmer, Gould, Seidensticker, Rudran, Sun-
quist, and Frazier, along with David Kessler, participated in the
“Bombay Natural History Society Centenary Seminar on Conser-
vation of Wildlife in Developing Countries.” Dr. Wemmer con-
sulted with members of the rucn Asian Elephant Group in India
and initiated efforts to investigate the population biology of cap-
tive elephants in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Nepal. The
National Zoo joined a breeding consortium with eleven other in-
stitutions and private aviculturists to establish a self-sustaining
captive population of black palm cockatoos.

Charles Pickett went to Pakistan on behalf of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and the Pakistan Department of Forestry to con-
sult on the establishment of a national zoo in Islamabad and to
promote crane conservation. He traveled throughout the country,
meeting with conservation officials and presenting lectures on
crane conservation, captive breeding, and current research needs.
During the same trip, he visited the Keoladeo Bird Sanctuary in
India and participated in the annual census of endangered Siberian
crane. Joan Smith began monitoring the captive population of
white-winged wood ducks in the United States as studbook liaison
for the Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, England. Dr. Scott Derrickson
continued to serve on the Whooping Crane Recovery Team and
consulted with a number of institutions in the United States
and abroad concerning crane propagation and reintroduction
techniques.

Jon Ballou was appointed aazpa studbook analyst for the Bali
mynah, and is completing a genetic and demographic analysis of
the U.S. captive population in preparation for a propagation/
reintroduction program in Indonesia. Drs. Kleiman, Seidensticker,
Morton, and Derrickson, along with Judith Block and Messrs.
Greenwell and Ballou, are currently cooperating with the aazpa,
the 1csp, and the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry in the planning,
coordination, and implementation of this important conservation
effort.

The most significant event in the bird collection this year was
the successful breeding and hatching of the Guam rail. Other sig-
nificant hatchings of birds included: Darwin’s rhea, Aleutian
Canada goose, white-winged wood duck, Laysan teal, white-naped
cranes, and Bali mynah.

Specimens of the following endangared species were born this

Science / 115
year: giant panda, Goeldi’s marmoset, golden lion tamerin, maned
wolf, clouded leopard, Eld’s deer, Persian onager, and Przewalski’s
horse. Of note was the ninety-eighth Pére David’s deer fawn and
the eighty-eighth scimitar horned oryx calf born at crc. Six sable
antelope calves were born in the new, large-scale breeding pro-
gram with this species at Front Royal.

PUBLIC INFORMATION AND EDUCATION

The National Zoo’s Office of Education completed two major proj-
ects in 1984: writing Families, Frogs, and Fun, the final report on
the three-year National Science Foundation grant for HERPlab, a
learning laboratory in the Zoo’s Reptile House; and, with the sup-
port of the Friends of the National Zoo, organizing a week-long
workshop for zoo educators on conservation in zoos.

The uerplab project, begun in 1981 to develop model family
educational activities that other zoos could duplicate, ended July
31, 1984. The book Families, Frogs, and Fun describes how the
project grew, explains the underlying philosophy, and shares what
was learned in the process. The hope is that it will guide col-
leagues who want to start or renovate a learning lab, as well as
stimulate thoughts of others interested in families and in learn-
ing or in creating interactive exhibits.

The Zoo Educators’ Workshop, held May 14-18, 1984, brought
together educators from five U.S. zoos to look for new ways to
reach visitors with the message of conservation. Conservation and
the Zoo Visitor documents this workshop; it reports notes from all
talks and details the process of developing objectives and projects.
Limited copies of both Conservation and the Zoo Visitor and
Families, Frogs, and Fun are available through the Office of
Education.

School programs and tours continued to be extremely success-
ful. One original program on reptiles and amphibians began for
prekindergarten through sixth grades, using the nerplab facilities
and some of its activities. Guides ask questions and encourage
careful observation and discussion among students to promote
appreciation of reptiles and amphibians.

CONSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT SERVICES

Renovation of the Monkey and Elephant Houses was completed
in October and November of 1983, respectively. Both provide
additional facilities for animal management and public viewing.

116 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Construction of Olmsted Walk, which is designed to enhance
and preserve the natural and historical character of the zoo, is
beginning in the fall of 1984. It will encompass a series of small
exhibits.

At the Conservation and Research Center, a veterinary hospital
is being constructed. It should be ready to provide for the con-
tinued health and welfare of the animals at crc by April 1985.
A new west wing to crc’s Small Animal Facility will be completed
by the winter of 1984.

Updating of fire protection devices, security monitoring, and
occupational health standards by the Office of Police and Safety
has resulted in a substantial decrease in reported accidents and
crime and improved health conditions of personnel and animals
during fiscal year 1984.

The Office of Graphics and Exhibits (ocE) completed the design
and fabrication of Smokey Bear’s feeder tree, and Dr. Michael
Robinson officially welcomed the public to the exhibit on July 25,
1984. A seven-panel exhibit on the return of captive-bred golden
lion tamarins to their native habitat in Brazil was dedicated in
early August. Photos of Nepal were exhibited in June.

A new system of public information was implemented and
“building closed” signs were standardized. The first Zoo Staff
Directory was distributed in June. Design was completed on a
fundraising brochure for the crc wildlife conservation training
program. Serving in a support capacity, ocE assisted the Zoo sym-
posia, Summerfest, ronz (Friends of the National Zoo) nights, the
panda furniture project, poster exhibits, and the Sunset Serenades.

ADMINISTRATION

After thirty years of dedicated service to the Smithsonian, Dr.
Theodore H. Reed, Senior Adviser for Animal Programs and for-
mer director of the National Zoological Park, retired effective
July 3, 1984. On May 21, 1984, Dr. Michael H. Robinson, former
deputy director of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,
was appointed director of the National Zoological Park.

On July 12, 1984, Dr. Devra G. Kleiman assumed the duties of
assistant director for Zoological Research and Educational Activi-
ties and Dr. Christen Wemmer was appointed assistant director
for Conservation and Captive Breeding Programs. Also on July
12, Dr. Scott Derrickson was appointed curator of birds allowing
Dr. Eugene Morton to resume his position as zoologist attached
to the Department of Zoological Research.

FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL ZOO
The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) celebrated its twenty-fifth
birthday in 1983 with expanded programs and increased grants
to assist NzP in education, conservation, and research projects.
Fonz has grown from a few neighborhood supporters and a $15
treasury in 1958 to a 50,000-member organization with forty full-
time employees and an annual budget of more than 4 million dol-
lars. Some $400,000 was committed to nzp-directed wildlife studies.

A principal part of Fonz support is the dedicated core of 530
volunteers who each year spend 45,000 hours to staff a dozen
different educational programs that serve tens of thousands of
zoogoers. This year, 104 volunteers spent 1,650 hours conducting
an around-the-clock watch on the giant pandas.

Recent emphasis on fundraising efforts has produced a bequest
brochure and staging of the first National ZooFari dinner-dance
benefit to launch the Theodore H. Reed Animal Acquisition Fund.

Financial information for calendar year 1983 is detailed below.
In addition, a percentage of the ronz-run food, shop, and parking
services is available to the Smithsonian for the benefit of the
National Zoo and is reported as income in the Financial Report
of the Smithsonian Institution.

Office of Fellowships and Grants

The Office of Fellowships and Grants (orc) continued to serve as
a Smithsonian link with scholarly organizations throughout the
world, encouraging research by individuals from universities, mu-
seums, and research organizations in the fields of art, history and
science. Scientists and scholars are placed throughout the Smith-
sonian to utilize the unique resources available, as well as to inter-
act with the professional staff. At present, two major activities are
managed and developed by this office: Academic Programs and the
Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program.

Academic Programs at the Smithsonian support and assist visit-
ing students and scholars. Opportunities for research are provided
at Smithsonian facilities, to be conducted in conjunction with staff
members. Residential appointments are offered at the under-
graduate, graduate, and professional levels.

The Institution further enhances the quality of its research and
extends its scholarly reach through the Smithsonian Foreign Cur-
rency Program (srcp). This program offers grants to the Smith-
sonian and other scholarly institutions in the United States to
conduct research in a limited number of foreign countries where
“excess currencies” are available. It is particularly effective in
strengthening the “increase and diffusion of knowledge” on an
international scale.

ACADEMIC PROGRAMS

Academic Programs at the Smithsonian complement programs
offered at universities. The national collections and the curators
who study them are unparalleled resources not available anywhere
else. At the Smithsonian, historical and anthropological objects,
original works of art, natural history specimens, living plants,
animals, and entire ecosystems are available for study. Educational
experience is enhanced by combining university training with field
research—and the breadth of field opportunities at the Smith-
sonian is unmatched.

The Office of Fellowships and Grants administered a variety of
academic appointments in 1984. Under the program of Research
Training Fellowships, begun in 1965, sixty-eight pre- and post-
doctoral fellowships were awarded this year. These appointees
pursue independent research projects under the guidance of staff
advisers for periods of six months to one year in residence at one
of the Institution’s bureaus or field sites. Topics of study for

Science / 119
Smithsonian fellows included: the regional patterns of settlement
and early survival of intertidal barnacles; the American landscape
in painting and prints from 1600 to 1820; observational and ex-
perimental studies in optical and infrared astronomy and radio
and geoastronomy; energetics of reproduction in eutherian and
marsupial mammals; material culture of the Mackenzie Eskimo at
contact time; goods and money in American rural life, 1780 to
1870; and a history of Black American art, 1650 to 1941.

In addition to the general program funded through the Office
of Fellowships and Grants, competitions for fellowships are also
held for specific awards. The First Ladies Fellowship, which sup-
ports the study of costume in America at the National Museum
of American History, was awarded for the third year. At the
National Air and Space Museum, the second recipient of the A.
Verville Fellowship will be studying the new American airplane
of 1934, and the Guggenheim Fellow will be doing a case study on
the nature of technological change, 1958 to 1983, emphasizing
civilian space station concepts.

In addition, twenty-one graduate student fellowships were
offered for ten-week periods during 1984.’ The participants are
usually junior graduate students beginning to explore avenues that
develop into dissertation research. This year some of these fellows
studied: metallurgy in ancient Ecuador and its role in New World
metallurgical development; the history of air conditioning in
America, 1906 to 1979; cranial variation in the beaked whale;
growth forms in two species of palms; and photography as public
image.

A number of senior fellowships continued to be offered. Smith-
sonian Institution Regents Fellows in residence this year included
Ekpo Eyo, director-general of the National Commission for Mu-
seums and Monuments in Nigeria, who was at the National Mu-
seum of African Art working on archeological excavations at Ife
and Owo and an illustrated history of Nigeria from the Stone Age
to the nineteenth century. The National Museum of American
History was host to Merritt Roe Smith, professor of the history of
technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working on
an interpretive history of the mechanization of U.S. industry in
the antebellum period.

At the National Museum of Natural History, Joseph Ewan,
emeritus professor of botany at Tulane University, engaged in
research for a biographical bibliography of trail narratives of nat-
uralists in South America; and James Griffin, senior research sci-

120 / Smithsonian Year 1984
entist in the Department of Anthropology at the University of
Michigan, researched Hopewell burial mound cultures of the upper
midwestern United States; and at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum,
George Nelson, an architect, was involved in research on the
theory of the workplace.

To honor Regent Emeritus James E. Webb, the Institution estab-
lished a number of fellowships in his name designed to promote
excellence in the management of cultural and scientific not-for-
profit organizations. The second awards were offered in 1984.
Catherine Ross, M.B.A. candidate at the University of Pennsyl-
vania, worked in the Smithsonian’s Office of Facilities Services.
Three Smithsonian staff members were selected to spend training
periods away from the Institution: Elizabeth Beuck Derbyshire,
Office of Folklife Programs, as a candidate for Master of Public
Administration at George Washington University; Elizabeth
Greene, Department of Mineral Sciences, as a candidate for a
Master of Arts in Museum Studies at George Washington Uni-
versity; and Kenneth Yellis, Department of Education, National
Portrait Gallery, as a candidate for Master of Public Administra-
tion at George Washington University.

This year several new features have been added to the program.
Webb fellows will be appointed for two years each and will be-
come members of the newly formed Webb Fellows Society. They
will advise the Office of Fellowships and Grants regarding the
shape and administration of the Webb Fellowship Program and
counsel persons contemplating applying for a Webb Fellowship.
The first eight Webb fellows, who are the founding members of
the Society of Webb Fellows, are the four appointed this year
along with the following who were appointed last year: Brooks

In 1984 the Smithsonian received a three-year grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation Residency Program in the Humanities for
postdoctoral fellowships at the National Museum of African Art
and the Center for Asian Art. The grant will support research in
residence at the museums in the areas of African art history and
anthropology, especially material culture, and in Asian art history
for research in the collections and on topics that may initiate
scholarly symposia, exhibitions, and other major museum activities.

During 1984 bureaus continued to offer support for visiting
scientists and scholars in cooperation with the Office of Fellow-
ships and Grants. These awards made possible visits to the Smith-
sonian by nineteen persons, principally scholars at midcareer, who
did not fall within the framework of the research training pro-
gram. The orc also continued the administration and partial sup-
port of the short-term visitor program. Fifty persons spent from
one week to a month at the Institution conducting research, study-
ing collections, and collaborating and conferring with professional
staff.

The expanded role of internships in the academic community
continued to be reflected within the Institution. The National Air
and Space Museum funded seven interns through orc this year.
The Cooper-Hewitt Museum again appointed four students under
the Sidney and Celia Siege] Fellowship fund. Internships in en-
vironmental studies at the Smithsonian Environmental Research
Center also continued. The Smith College-Smithsonian Program
in American Studies is now in its fifth year and seven students
will participate in a seminar course and conduct research projects
under the direction of staff members through this program. Other
interns were placed through bureau internship coordinators, while
the orc administered all stipend awards for internships.

For the fourth year the orc offered academic opportunities to
improve minority participation in Smithsonian programs. These
opportunities included fellowships for minority faculty members
and faculty from minority colleges, and internships for minority
undergraduate and graduate students. Awards were made to six-
teen interns who were placed at a variety of bureaus and offices
on the Mall and at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Cen-
ter and the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum. Some of these ap-
pointments have already developed into permanent relationships.
The orc also awarded five fellowships to faculty members to con-
duct research on subjects such as the black middle class family
in historical and societal contexts, an examination of the attitude
and levels of knowledge possessed by parents concerning the role
and function of toys and play in children’s development, black
residential patterns and the city, and Cincinnati from 1802 to 1850.

The Smithsonian’s Cooperative Education Program, administered
by the orc, is a student employment program that encourages
minority graduate students to work in professional and adminis-
trative positions at the Institution for sixteen to twenty-six weeks,
separated by periods of study at their university. It offers the

122 / Smithsonian Year 1984
potential for permanent employment at the Smithsonian. Since
January 1983, when the orc assumed management, thirty-one
student co-op appointments have been made in various Smithsonian
bureaus and offices.

The position of academic network coordinator was added to the
oFG in 1984 to sustain and enhance these efforts to bring minority
scholars and students to the Institution. This position serves as a
link between the Smithsonian and the outside scholarly commu-
nity, developing communication between the two and furthering
efforts to incorporate minorities into the Smithsonian workforce
and research opportunities.

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards
grants to support the research interests of American institutions,
including the Smithsonian, in those countries in which the United
States holds blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of
surplus agricultural commodities under Public Law 480. The pro-
gram is active in countries in which the Treasury Department de-
clares United States holdings of these currencies to be in excess
of normal federal requirements, including, in 1984, Burma, Guinea,
India, and Pakistan. Research projects are moving toward con-
clusion under program support in the former excess-currency
countries of Egypt, Poland, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia.

The Smithsonian received a fiscal year 1984 appropriation of
$4 million in “excess” currencies to support projects in anthro-
pology and archeology, systematic and environmental biology,
astrophysics, earth sciences, and museum professional fields. From
its inception in fiscal year 1966 through fiscal year 1984, the srcp
has awarded about $57 million in foreign currency grants to 233
institutions in forty-one states and the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico.

This year the projects, which ranged over many disciplines,
included: ethnographic studies of northern populations in Paki-
stan; archeological investigations in the Egyptian Western Desert;
paleoanthropological studies of Later Miocene hominids in Paki-
stan; photographic documentation of the Buddhist cave paintings
at Ajanta, India; historical investigation of the depletion of tropical
forests in India; architectural survey of Indian temples; documen-
tation of contemporary architecture; studies of the reproductive
behavior of mugger crocodiles; studies of the history and move-
ment of ancient ground waters using fission tracking procedures;
and ecological and behavioral studies of the native bees of
Pakistan.

During this year the Smithsonian conveyed $1,040,000 equiva-
lent in Pakistan rupees, the second installment of the U.S. con-
tribution to the UNESCO campaign to salvage and preserve Moen-
jodaro, the 4,500-year-old Indus civilization city in Pakistan. This
site, first discovered in 1921, is being eroded by highly saline
groundwater and floods of the meandering Indus River. A ground-
water-control scheme to lower the water table is in place and
numerous other operations are underway.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Ever since Galileo Galilei turned his crude optical telescope on the
heavens and found that the vague cloud known as the Milky Way
was, in fact, “a congeries of innumerable stars grouped together
in clusters,” the advance of astronomical discovery has followed
closely the development of new instrumentation. During the past
twenty-five years particularly, the flight into space of detectors
sensitive to infrared, X-ray, and ultraviolet radiation has created
a vision of the universe that would astound even the remarkably
prescient Galileo.

Although the direct relationship between new instrumentation
and new discoveries is clearly recognized, it is no longer practi-
cal—or even possible—for the visionary scientist simply to patch
together magnifying lenses in a wooden tube, walk into the evening
dark, and discover unknown worlds. Not only have all the “easy”
tasks of astronomy been accomplished, but society itself has
become more complicated. In the late twentieth century, astron-
omy—all science, really—is no longer so much an individual enter-
prise as a collective activity, supported by the general public,
responding to national goals, and answering broad questions.

More practically stated, the advance of modern astronomy—
through the development of new instrumentation—requires copi-
ous funding, large teams of specialists, and, most important, many
years of careful planning and design. Indeed, the time scale for
most major instruments is a decade or more, especially if the
instrument is to be a national or international facility.

Significantly, then, planning began this year at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory (sao) on several long-range projects
that hold the promise of advancing astronomical knowledge. The

124 / Smithsonian Year 1984
largest of these potential projects, and one that has inspired con-
siderable effort by the observatory staff, is a proposed array
of telescopes for observations of submillimeter-wave radiation.
The submillimeter band of the electromagnetic spectrum is the
only wavelength region yet unexplored from the ground. The
need for sufficiently precise machining of antennas and, more im-
portant, for receivers capable of detecting such celestial radiation
efficiently, has prevented development of this promising field
until quite recently. Several single-dish submillimeter telescopes
are now either under construction or in planning stages through-
out the world, and an internal committee of observatory scientists
recommended that sao consider the more ambitious approach of
an array of six dishes, each of six-meter diameter, with the dishes
movable along several-hundred-meter-long arms of a Y-shaped
set of tracks. The scientific possibilities of such an instrument are
rich, ranging from the study of newly forming stars to the study
of the dynamic phenomena taking place at the cores of active
galaxies. The concept for the array, dubbed star for Submillimeter
Telescopes Arrayed for high Resolution, is being reviewed by
about forty scientists in the United States and Europe.

High spatial resolution, that is, the ability to discern distinct
features of individual astronomical objects located close together
is a goal of all observational astronomers. The resolving power of
an instrument increases with the size of its aperture, but practical
considerations of weight and cost limit the size of any single mir-
ror or antenna. One means of increasing aperture is by employing
the principle of interferometry in which the signals gathered by
two or more telescopes are combined to produce a resolution
equivalent to that of a single instrument with a diameter equal to
the maximum distance between any two of the telescopes. The
STAR array uses this principle in the submillimeter region of the
spectrum; but, in the optical region, several sao groups are also
investigating means for achieving unprecedented resolutions
through interferometers in space.

In space, above Earth’s obscuring atmosphere, properly posi-
tioned and finely controlled optical instruments can, theoretically,
achieve resolutions limited only by the quality of the telescopic
system. The resultant resolutions may be as much as 10,000 to
100,000 times that possible with ground-based instruments. Sev-
eral designs for such space interferometers have been suggested by
SAO scientists: a linear array of mirrors mounted on a thirty-meter-
long rigid structure; two mirrors orbiting up to ten miles apart

Science / 125
and feeding their separately received signals into a third “beam-
combiner” satellite orbiting between them; and, small, modular
interferometers that could fit into the Space Shuttle bay.

Obviously, these and other instrument development projects at
SAO require imagination, innovation, ingenuity, and not a little
institutional courage. Risks are inherent in all pioneering attempts:
careers, funds, and time must be committed many years in advance
to projects whose outcomes cannot be guaranteed—or even
guessed at. Still, sao has a long history of successful scientific
risk-taking. The tradition of innovation in engineering and instru-
ment-making can be traced from Langley’s bolometer of the 1880s
to Whipple’s satellite-tracking cameras of the 1950s to the Multi-
ple Mirror Telescope of the 1970s, a joint project with the Uni-
versity of Arizona. The concept of multiple-mirror arrays for
optical telescopes, considered radical, revolutionary, and, to some,
even foolhardy when first proposed, was recommended this year
as the preferred design for the proposed National New Technology
Telescope, a fifteen-meter-diameter optical giant. Sao’s spirit of
innovation certainly seems justified by this decision. In the next
century, astronomers may look back on sao’s submillimeter-wave
array or its optical interferometers as similarly vital milestones in
the advancement of astronomy.

The development of new instrumentation for astronomy is only
one part of the diverse research program carried out by sao in
collaboration with the Harvard College Observatory. Together
under a single director, the two observatories form the Center for
Astrophysics (cFA), where investigations of the joint staff are
organized by divisions. Some highlights of research activity dur-
ing the past year, by division, follow; for more detailed informa-
tion on specific subjects, readers are invited to consult the bibliog-
raphy of scientific papers by observatory scientists published else-
where in this volume.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS

Because most of what is learned about celestial objects is gained
by detailed studies of the light their atoms and molecules emit
and of the modification of this light on its way to Earth, precise
and comprehensive laboratory and theoretical studies of atomic
and molecular properties are needed to understand the processes
occurring in such objects and to interpret astronomical observa-
tions made with ground-based and satellite-borne telescopes. The
Atomic and Molecular Physics Division carries out research in

126 / Smithsonian Year 1984
theoretical and experimental physics and chemistry to provide
these data and the basic understanding of the processes. Atomic
and molecular physics research benefits from the interaction be-
tween theorists and experimentalists, and members of the division
do research on processes common to the Sun, the interstellar
medium, comets, and planetary atmospheres.

The light reaching Earth from a distant star begins its journey
as a stream of X-ray or gamma-ray photons deep inside the hot
interior of the star. As this light makes its way to the surface,
it interacts with the atoms and ions in the star’s outer layer. Some
of these interactions, for example, a “recombination” in which
the electron of an atom is captured by a positive ion to produce
an “excited state,” produce a distinctive light signal that can be
used to infer the temperature, density, and chemical components
of the star’s atmosphere. In the laboratory, experiments are being
devised so that the radiation emitted by excited systems can be
used to identify and study corresponding processes in astrophysi-
cal plasmas.

The absorption of light by molecules in laboratory, atmospheric,
or astrophysical gases is an important process because in many
cases it can lead to dissociation of the molecule or to production
of energetic forms of the molecule, which can influence other
processes in the gas. Progress has been made this year in under-
standing the process in a quantitative way. For example, by mak-
ing laboratory measurements at high resolution of the absorption
of light by molecular oxygen at various pressures, we have im-
proved knowledge of the strength of the absorption at particular
ultraviolet wavelengths. These new measurements imply that sig-
nificant changes must be made in the estimates of stratospheric
concentrations of ozone, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide.
The implications for our understanding of the effects of human
activity on the environment may prove of considerable importance.

HIGH ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS

The High Energy Astrophysics Division is primarily involved in
the study of X-ray emission from celestial sources, including some
of the most energetic and exotic objects in the universe, such as
pulsars, neutron stars, and black holes. Because X-rays cannot
pass through Earth’s atmosphere, X-ray astronomy must be carried
out from space.

At present, division members are heavily involved in the analy-
sis of scientific data from nasa’s two High Energy Astronomy

Science / 127
Observatories, the HEAO-1 and HEAO-2, the latter better known as
the “Einstein Satellite.” The Einstein observations represent the
most sensitive X-ray data available, and ongoing research programs
involve all types of known astronomical objects. A data bank has
been established at sao to allow full access to the Einstein data by
the international scientific community.

A highlight of research this year was the discovery of X-ray
emission from hot gas associated with the outer regions, or
“haloes,” of elliptical galaxies. As stars evolve, they liberate large
amounts of gas, and the fate of this gas in elliptical galaxies has
been a long-standing puzzle. Most astronomers believed that this
gas simply flowed out of the galaxies in what is called a galactic
wind. However, our X-ray observations have now shown that this
is not the case; surprisingly, the gas is still contained in the
galaxies. By processes still unknown (but possibly involving energy
provided when stars explode as supernovae), the gas is heated to
very high temperatures and glows in the X-ray band. Moreover,
the X-ray data allow us to probe, for the first time, the underlying
gravitational force required to hold this gas. Indeed, the haloes
of elliptical galaxies must contain a mass equivalent to one trillion
suns. However, most of this underlying mass is not contained in
stars observed in visible light, nor is it contained in the X-ray-
emitting gas we have observed. The nature of this invisible mate-
rial, which accounts for most of the mass of the elliptical galaxies
(and many other astronomical systems as well), is currently one
of the great mysteries of astrophysics.

Division members are also working with the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration (NASA) on the design and defini-
tion studies for the next large X-ray satellite, the Advanced X-ray
Astrophysics Facility (AxaF). The fabrication of two sets of X-ray
mirrors should allow the development and demonstration of those
techniques eventually required to build the axar telescope. Com-
pletion of these test mirrors is scheduled for mid-1985, when a
series of detailed X-ray tests will verify their performance. Im-
provements in the manufacture of X-ray mirrors and in the per-
formance of X-ray detectors suggest that axaF will be 100 times
more sensitive than the Einstein Satellite.

Work continued on the Normal Incidence X-ray Telescope
(n1xT) with design, testing, and initial fabrication of various ele-
ments, all geared to a 1986 rocket flight. Nixt uses a revolutionary
approach to X-ray imaging involving alternating multiple layers
of high and low absorption materials such as tungsten and carbon

128 / Smithsonian Year 1984
and is capable of providing very high spatial resolution imaging
and simultaneous spectroscopy for studies of the hot outer atmo-
spheres of our Sun and other stars.

OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY

There are two main scientific themes to the research in optical and
infrared astronomy: What is the large-scale structure of the uni-
verse, how did it get that way, and what will be its fate? How
and when did galaxies form, how have they evolved and what can
we learn about these processes from detailed studies of our own
galaxy? To pursue these questions, division scientists rely heavily
on ground-based telescopes, such as the facilities at the Fred Law-
rence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, the site of
the Multiple Mirror Telescope (mmr). Optical observations were
complemented by infrared measurements made from the ground,
NASA aircraft, and high-altitude balloons.

When viewed over scales as large as a billion light years, the
universe appears frothy. Galaxies tend to congregate in clusters
and sheets surrounding vast empty regions. This general picture,
which has defied easy theoretical interpretation, was suggested
most clearly by the Center for Astrophysics Redshift Survey,
which was able to map out the distribution of 2,400 of the brighter
galaxies, mostly in the northern sky. Because unexpectedly large
structures showed up in the initial survey, it is now being extended
deeper into space and into the southern sky. In the north, much
time on the 60-inch Tillinghast Reflector at the Whipple Observa-
tory is dedicated to this effort, which will take several years to
complete. In the south, a collaboration with the Observatorio
Nacional de Brasil is producing redshifts of the same quality as
the northern data from Mt. Hopkins. These efforts should enhance
the scientific value of the Redshift Survey, already considered by
many to be the most important contribution to observational cos-
mology of the past ten years.

The Century Survey, a related project that has just begun, will
ultimately provide a complete list of positions and magnitudes for
all galaxies brighter than a carefully calibrated limit in a narrow
strip running through the north galactic pole. This survey will go
much deeper into space than the Redshift Survey, and the final
catalog is expected to contain 100,000 galaxies. The importance of
this effort was emphasized recently when division scientists
showed that the principal earlier work (the Shane-Wirtaanen
counts) is inadequate for studies of the large-scale structure of the

Science / 129
universe because of previously unrecognized systematic errors
present in the data.

An important result from the mmT was the identification of
primordial clouds of gas that contain almost enough matter to
form galaxies. This was part of a general effort to study the
spectra of the most distant quasars using very high spectral reso-
lution, an area where the mmr is the world leader. In this applica-
tion, the quasars serve as bright “laboratory lamps” shining
through the intervening clouds of intergalactic gas, whose char-
acteristics may be deduced from the narrow (absorption) lines
that they introduce into the continuous spectrum of the light from
the quasar.

Several investigations focused on the structure and dynamics of
star systems in our own galaxy. One such study concentrated on
the oldest stars. Mostly the galaxy has a flattened disklike appear-
ance, but there is also a population of stars in a more spherical,
halo distribution above the galactic plane. These stars must have
formed in the earliest stages of the formation of our galaxy itself,
and in their atmospheres is preserved information about the abun-
dances of the chemical elements present ten to fifteen billion years
ago. A survey identified a few hundred new halo stars, more than
doubling the number known previously. This identification has
already led to a new determination of the rotation of the galactic
disk and, for the first time, to a precise determination of the
velocity needed by an object to escape from the galaxy. These
results are important because they will help determine the total
mass of the Milky Way.

Four major programs in infrared astronomy were pursued. In
the first, a small, helium-cooled infrared telescope has been con-
structed for space flight aboard the Spacelab 2 mission of the
Space Shuttle, now scheduled for April 1985. This instrument will
be used to map the sky for diffuse infrared sources. In the second
program, a one-meter balloon-borne infrared telescope is used, for
example, to discover star-forming regions in the galaxy. The third
program is a design study for a three-meter balloon-borne tele-
scope for far-infrared and submillimeter astronomy. The fourth
involves the use of an experimental two-dimensional infrared
camera for ground-based observations of star-forming regions,
galaxies, and planetary nebulae. A similar camera proposed by
sao, in collaboration with other organizations, was selected for
design study as one of three instruments to fly on Nasa’s Space
Infrared Telescope Facility.

detector known as a charge-coupled device, or CCD, attached to an optical
telescope at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The Smithsonian has been a
pioneer in the development of these detectors. (Photograph by Rudolph Schild)

A 102-centimeter balloon-borne infrared telescope designed by the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory for photometry, spectroscopy, and high-resolution
mapping of star-formation regions in the galaxy was launched from Texas in
April 1984 as part of an on-going program of balloon astronomy.

Division scientists also were involved in gamma-ray astronomy,
using the ten-meter reflector at the Whipple Observatory to search
for high-energy gamma-rays from several sources and carrying out
design studies for a very large gamma-ray telescope in space that
would make use of the expended external tank of the Space
Shuttle as part of the Space Station program.

PLANETARY SCIENCES

Members of the division study the planets and small bodies of the
solar system in three ways: by telescopic observation, by theoreti-
cal analysis, and by examining samples of extraterrestrial mate-
rials in the laboratory.

The observation program centers on the Oak Ridge Observatory
in Harvard, Massachusetts, which is well suited for determining
the exact orbital paths of comets and asteroids in the solar system.
To do this requires that positions of the bodies be determined
very precisely on a number of different nights. Travel costs and
the intense competition for telescope time make it impossible to
use the larger western telescopes for such observations.

The Oak Ridge program of regular observations is coordinated
with the work of the International Astronomical Union’s Minor
Planet Center and Central Telegram Bureau, both of which are
directed by a division member. These facilities verify observations
of comets and asteroids, compute their exact orbit, and dissemi-
nate this information to institutions around the world in a timely
way. In the last year, 125 IAU Circulars and 900 Minor Planet
Circulars were distributed. About 200 newly discovered asteroids
were formally assigned numbers, and improved orbits were deter-
mined for about 1,000 other new objects. These functions are self-
supporting through an annual contribution from the 1au and sub-
scriptions purchased by professional and amateur astronomers.
This year particular effort has been put into the establishment of
a computer service, which allows subscribers to see the [AU Circu-
lars on the day of issue, and carry on other transactions with the
Central Telegram Bureau and Minor Planet Center, via computer
and telephone.

Data from the nasa Voyager spacecraft contributed to several
observational programs as well. A division member who is also a
member of the Imaging Team of the Voyager mission to the outer
planets investigated a variety of phenomena observed by Voyager
on Jupiter, Saturn, and the satellites of these planets. An example

132 / Smithsonian Year 1984
of these is the observation that Europa (one of Jupiter’s four larg-
est satellites; about the size of Earth’s moon) appears to be
actively erupting water at its surface. Europa is thought to con-
tain about 5 percent water, in the form of an ice crust about eighty
kilometers thick. Apparently heat from the satellite’s interior melts
the base of the ice crust and erupts the water in surface “‘vol-
canoes,” in a manner closely analogous to the melting of rock
and the eruption of lava on Earth. Another division scientist used
Voyager photographs to complete a preliminary geological map
of an area on the surface of the Jupiter satellite Ganymede.

Theoretical studies in the division included an investigation of
the way comets decay and, in some cases, break up. Comets are
masses of snow and dust a few kilometers in size: as their orbits
carry them near the Sun, the warmth vaporizes the snow; streams
of escaping vapor can act like rocket engines, changing the orbital
path of the comet. Eventually every comet’s snow is completely
vaporized away, but there is still a question of what is left: A
coherent asteroid? Or an incoherent collection of pebbles and dust
that disperses in space?

The detailed properties of meteorites and lunar samples were
studied in the laboratory, using microscopic and microanalytical
techniques. Meteorites contain a cryptic record of events and pro-
cesses associated with the origin of the solar system, and even pre-
solar system history. Lunar samples contain an equally cryptic
record of the earliest internal evolution of a small planet. The
meteorite research centered on the origin of chondrules, tiny
igneous droplets that are abundant in the most primitive class of
meteorites. These objects were somehow melted and partly vapor-
ized at the time when the solar system was being formed. Such
processes may have occurred when aggregations of presolar inter-
stellar dust fell into the primordial disk of gas that gave rise to
the solar system: as the aggregations plunged through the gas
they were heated by gas drag, much like meteors in Earth’s upper
atmosphere, and melted into droplets.

Laboratory determinations were also made of the concentration
of radioactive isotopes in meteorites collected in Antarctica by the
National Science Foundation (NsF) Polar Program, and also in
Antarctic ice samples. The levels of these radioactive isotopes
reveal how long the meteorites have lain on or in the ice since they
fell, and how long it has been since the ice formed (fell as snow)
on the polar ice cap. A division member has participated in two
of the NsF meteorite-collecting expeditions to Antarctica.

RADIO AND GEOASTRONOMY

Radio and Geoastronomy Division staff pursue a broad range of
research topics, including tests of Einstein’s theory of general rela-
tivity, the physical structure of other planets, chemical composition
of clouds in space, the processes by which stars are born, the mo-
tions of radio stars, physical properties of very distant radio stars,
extragalactic radio sources, measurements of continental drift, ir-
regularities of the rotation of Earth, research on atomic clocks, and
the development of new instrumentation.

Two important efforts are now under way to develop powerful
new instruments for astronomical research. First, a Centerwide com-
mittee investigated the desirability and feasibility of an array of six
radio antennas operating in the submillimeter portion of the radio
spectrum. The design calls for six antennas, each with diameters of
six meters, spaced up to several hundred meters apart along the
arms of a “Y” configuration. Necessarily located on a high moun-
tain topto reduce the interference from water vapor in the atmo-
sphere, the array’s resolution will be better than one second of arc,
or more than ten times better than any other instrument under con-
struction or planned for use at submillimeter wavelengths. Because
the submillimeter array would operate at what is called “the last
frontier of ground-based astronomy,” it promises rich scientific op-
portunities, including: probes of regions of star formation, analyses
of galactic structure, investigations of the cores of quasars and
active galactic nuclei, and studies of objects in the solar system.

Second, the ability to place optical instruments in space will al-
low an angle-measuring instrument of unprecedented accuracy.
Such an instrument, called an optical interferometer, appears feasi-
ble using currently available technology. The various configura-
tions now being investigated all offer enormous resolution ad-
vances over ground-based telescopes, whose resolution is limited
by fluctuations in Earth’s atmosphere. For example, the 1,000-fold
improvement in resolution over a ground-based telescope suggests
that an optical interferometer operating in space would allow im-
proved determination of astronomical distances, estimates of star
masses, discovery of other planetary systems, and exquisitely accu-
rate tests of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The development
of such a system is currently supported by the construction of a
ground-based optical interferometer and related laboratory work.

Research on hydrogen masers and experiments using them for
time and frequency coordination and testing theories of gravitation

134 / Smithsonian Year 1984
and relativity continued. Two masers were completed and delivered
to the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., where they
are now designated as “Master Clocks 1 and 2.” The stability and
time-keeping accuracy of these clocks exceed any previously made;
indeed, their accuracy, + 0.5 X 10° seconds per month, is at least
as good as that available from the entire U.S. Naval Observatory
ensemble of some twenty-five cesium-beam clocks.

Research on electrodynamic interactions between long orbiting
wires and the ionosphere continued. In particular, Shuttle-borne
electrodynamic tethers were studied to determine the tether’s abil-
ity to draw current from the ionosphere and to generate, by conse-
quence, a substantial amount of electric power in space.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS

The development of new instrumentation, coupled with advances
in theoretical physics and with the improvement of computation
techniques, have altered modern studies of solar and stellar physics
in two striking ways.

Stars are no longer seen as isolated spheres of gas quietly drift-
ing through space. Their atmospheres are better described as caul-
drons of bubbling, magnetic gas being buffeted and blown into
space by waves and surges from the interior. Stars are now seen as
“open” systems that condense from the interstellar gas and dust,
then burn their nuclear fuel—often acquiring peculiar chemical
compositions in the process—and ultimately return most of their
material to space, either gradually, as in winds and breezes, or vio-
lently in explosive novae and supernovae.

At the same time, solar and stellar astronomers have come to
realize that many of the activities formerly seen only on the Sun’s
surface, and in the Sun’s outer atmosphere—the “chromosphere”
and “corona” that were originally discovered during eclipses—can
now be detected in the signals from other stars. This year, for ex-
ample, observations by division scientists using the International
Untraviolet Explorer (rue) Satellite led to the first detection of a
stellar “flare” from a giant star. For many years, solar flares have
been observed in the intense magnetic fields of sunspots, and flares
had been known among the smaller, dwarf stars; however, this
observation of stellar flares in a giant, evolved star, has added
another link in the “solar-stellar connection.” Other programs with
the ve include ultraviolet observations of faint exploding stars and
the remnants of supernovae, as well as the monitoring of emissions

Science / 135
that reveal activity cycles similar to the twenty-two-year cycle of
our Sun in several cool stars. In addition, collaborative ground-
based studies with researchers at the Mt. Wilson Observatory have
monitored calcium emission from the chromospheres of Sun-like
stars. A survey of such emission in a variety of cool dwarfs has led
to the conclusion that the magnesium and calcium emissions are
dependent, not only on the star’s mass, but on its rotational speed—
for reasons that are not understood.

Stellar observations this year were remarkable for the variety of
instruments they called into play: from studies of chemical abun-
dances in the oldest members of the galaxy—the globular cluster
stars—with the ground-based telescopes of the Whipple Observa-
tory and the Mt. Wilson Observatory, to the observations of a
young supernovae remnant in a neighboring irregular galaxy with
the Einstein Satellite. And a coordinated program of ground-based
observations of the brightness and polarization of the light of the
supergiant red star Betelgeuse (the brightest star in the Constella-
tion Orion) was initiated to provide data for diagnosing this star’s
variations. Although they are subtle, these variations may be symp-
toms of fundamental processes by which such stars return their
matter to space as their cores evolve toward a super-condensed
state. The preliminary results suggest that the heightened atmo-
spheric activity in Betelgeuse may lag the optical brightening by
one-tenth of the six-year period; and, if confirmed, this lag would
be an important clue to the nature of the motions in the star’s outer
layers.

For decades, the high temperature of the Sun’s corona has been
recognized as a key feature of the Sun’s atmosphere, requiring a
vast amount of heat to be supplied by waves from the cooler layers
beneath. Recently, the outward flow of the corona has been recog-
nized as an equally challenging enigma. Clues are being sought in
the nature of the magnetic fields of the Sun.

Like Earth, the Sun has a magnetic field reaching out from its
interior. Unlike Earth’s field, the Sun’s is widely variable (with a
full cycle of reversal in twenty-two years) and it is swept aside or
brought together here and there by the motions of the Sun’s
ionized gas. This turbulent activity is thought to be generated
by the “boiling” motions of the deep layers, and it is accompanied
by eddies and streamers, which move outward at supersonic
speeds. The cause of these rapid motions is a mystery, and the
mystery was deepened this year when, for the first time, they
were observed well down inside the dark gaps in the corona

136 / Smithsonian Year 1984
known as “coronal holes.” (These observations were made by sao
scientists in collaboration with the High Altitude Observatory by
means of an ultraviolet coronagraph that was carried aloft on a
rocket.) The outflow of coronal material was traced to within 0.5
solar radii of the surface, pointing to a source of acceleration
whose identity will be the goal of future observations.

Some of the energy required to maintain the hot corona is re-
leased in the neighborhood of coronal “bright points,” which ap-
pear to be small active regions associated with locally intensified
magnetic fields. These regions are being studied with data from
Skylab as well as a program of simultaneous observations in opti-
cal radation with the Solar Tower Telescope at Sacramento Peak
Observatory and radio interferometry with the Very Large Array
(vita). These observations are providing maps of unprecedented
spatial detail as well as rapid time resolution and are expected
to provide insights to the heat supply of the corona.

Division scientists have constructed a simulation of the solar
spectrum incorporating seventeen million atomic and molecular
transitions, and this tool has been applied to another long-stand-
ing enigma concerning solar temperature. However, this mystery
concerns the coolest, rather than the hottest, region of the Sun.
For nearly a century, it has been recognized that the temperatures
of both the solar interior and the corona reach millions of degrees,
even though the temperature of the surface layers remains a rela-
tively cool 6,000 K. Clearly, at some intermediate level the tem-
perature must reach a minimum, and the depth of this minimum
is a clue to the energy balance of the Sun’s outer layers. But the
precise value of the minimum has been an elusive quantity and
different observational techniques seemed to imply different values.
The agreement was greatly improved this year when the newly
synthesized spectrum was used as a model for interpreting the solar
observations. For the first time, data from the ultraviolet, the
visible, and the infrared agree, and this new solar profile is ready
for interpretation by theoreticians.

Progress in astrophysics has invariably been stimulated by the
use of new observational instruments, and with this in mind,
division scientists are developing several advanced detectors. This
year, a new version of the speckle interferometer, technically
called the Precision Analog Photon Address detector, and known
as the “para,” was built, tested in the laboratory, and taken to
remote sites for observing runs on the Steward Observatory 90-
inch-diameter telescope, the Whipple Observatory mmr, and the

Science / 137
University of Hawaii 88-inch telescope. Interpreting the data from
this device requires an intensive series of computations, and these
early field tests produced six ‘firsts’: images showing the rotation
of the asteroid Vesta, and new companions to the stars T Tauri,
Mu Cassiopeia, and Alpha, Delta, and Gamma Orionis.

Engineering studies of large interferometers for various space
platforms were also carried out, and they suggest that, perhaps
more than any other major civilian science project, such inter-
ferometry would depend on the servicing capability of a space
station.

Historical research in the division touched on the lives and the
many contributions of women at the Harvard College Observatory
during the years 1875-1925. Work also continued on the anno-
tated census of Copernicus’ De revolutionibus, and fewer than
twenty (of about 580) copies remain unexamined. Finally, a study
of Vincent van Gogh’s night paintings showed that they have a
strong element of astronomical reality.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS

The Theoretical Astrophysical Division carried out research on a
diverse range of astrophysical phenomena, with studies often ap-
plied to the support and interpretation of observational data.
Division members frequently collaborate with scientists in other
institutions and with members of other divisions in their research
as well as contribute significantly to educational programs.

The research of the division is largely concentrated on studies of
the extreme states of matter, radiation, magnetic fields and gravity,
and their fundamental roles in determining the observed structure
of objects in the universe. The mode of attack on such problems
is a combination of pure analytical techniques and numerical
modeling with computers. Particular applications have included:
interstellar clouds, accretion disks, stellar winds, planetary forma-
tion, star formation, globular clusters, X-ray sources, and infla-
tionary cosmologies.

One noteworthy example of research in the division concerned
the postcollapse evolution of globular clusters. Globular clusters
are beautiful astronomical objects, containing about a million stars
in a roughly spherical distribution, relatively sparse in the outer
layers, but becoming quite dense in the center. The special shape

138 / Smithsonian Year 1984
of such clusters is largely determined by gravitational encounters
between the individual stars, especially in the central core. These
encounters cause the cluster to become ever more centrally con-
centrated; in fact, simplified analytical estimates predicted that the
central clustering of stars must become infinitely dense at some
time—a catastrophe known as “core collapse.” Furthermore, from
these studies it was clear that many of the globular clusters now
seen should have already undergone core collapse. It was generally
agreed that various physical effects, such as formation of binary
stars, would prevent any real catastrophe, but, despite much
analytical work, no one was able to state unambiguously just what
a “postcollapse” globular cluster was supposed to look like. Nor
could any existing computer program answer this question, since
each was designed to treat only a portion of the relevant physics.
However, a division member, using a clever matching of several
independent computer programs, was able to overcome their indi-
vidual limitations and to simulate numerically both the core col-
lapse and the subsequent postcollapse phase. Preliminary results
indicate that the theoretical structure of postcollapse globular
clusters is consistent with the properties of observed globular
clusters, thus removing a disturbing gap in our understanding of
these objects.

Another investigation concerned one of the most exciting recent
theories in cosmology, the “new inflationary universe.” Some
fundamental theories of elementary particle physics have sug-
gested that the universe underwent a phase of rapid expansion
at a very early time in its history, indeed, only microseconds after
the Big Bang itself, a time when particle energies were enormous.
This expansion, or “inflationary” phase, explains several previ-
ously inexplicable facts about our universe, such as its impressive
uniformity. In principle, the properties of the new inflationary
cosmology might also be used to predict the deviations from uni-
formity in the early universe, and thus to determine the very
fluctuations in density out of which galaxies and other large-scale
structures formed. This would provide a critical test of such in-
flationary theories as well as of the underlying elementary particle
theories. To carry out such a program, one division member is
using a simplified model of quantum field theory to predict the
nature of the initial fluctuations. This eventually will be supple-
mented by a detailed analysis of the subsequent development, by
gravitational instability, of the fluctuations to the point where they
become observable structures, such as galaxies or clusters of gal-

Science / 139
axies. In this project, one can see the surprising unity of theoreti-
cal astrophysics in which an explanation of the largest structures
in the universe is derived from properties of the smallest elemen-
tary particles.

Smithsonian Environmental Research Center

Basic scientific research aimed at understanding the processes oc-
curring in the environment and their influence on biological sys-
tems and organisms has been the principal activity of the Smith-
sonian Environmental Research Center (serc) during the first year
since its formation administratively on July 1, 1983. This research
is long-term and emphasizes both laboratory and field-oriented
studies in three major areas: Regulatory Biology, Environmental
Biology, and Radiocarbon Dating.

Serc has two principal facilities: a 50,000-square-foot laboratory
at Rockville, Maryland, and 2,600 acres of land with a small lab-
oratory and some support buildings at Edgewater, Maryland. The
Edgewater property constitutes a unique estuarine research oppor-
tunity, comprising nearly one-third of the watershed surrounding
the Rhode River Estuary, a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay
located a few miles south of Annapolis, Maryland.

These two facilities are separated geographically by forty-five
miles. A major effort has been made during the year to inventory
all space, equipment, support, and administrative services and
research activities of serc. Following an intensive iterative process,
the first phase of a Master Plan for the consolidation of facilities
and research programs has been completed. The initial priority was
to ascertain the feasibility of locating all of serc activities at Edge-
water, and then to select a suitable site for the construction of
permanent quarters. A site near the present complex of existing
buildings has been selected for construction of a facility that will
not only enhance laboratory-oriented research, but also will not
impact unfavorably upon the long-term field sites under study
or detract from the aesthetic qualities of the estuarine setting.

The Center also maintains an educational program that includes
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate work/learn
students, and public educational activities. The public education
aspects emphasize teacher- and docent-led tours and activities.
Docents guide adult and family groups on a two-mile Discovery

140 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Trail through outdoor research areas. A pamphlet keyed to signs
on the Discovery Trail makes the walk self-guiding for visitors
who are not on a scheduled tour. A recently developed sound-
track slide show describes the research at both Rockville and
Edgewater.

Forty-two regular scientific seminars were held at both Edge-
water and Rockville in fiscal year 1984. This is an ongoing edu-
cational activity of seRc, serving to inform the scientific public
about src research activities as well as to inform serc staff about
the work of colleagues in universities and other governmental
laboratories.

Serc staff members were frequently invited to present seminars
and lectures to universities and laboratories and to participate in
international and national symposia and scientific meetings. The
staff also routinely served as reviewers for grant proposals to
federal agencies and as reviewers of manuscripts submitted to
peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Research is done by staff scientists who represent a diverse
number of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, math-
ematics, and engineering, in the framework of two divisions:
Regulatory Biology and Environmental Biology. The principal
product of serc, its research publications, could not be achieved
without the continuing collaboration between its scientific and
support staffs. The scientific staff this year particularly wishes to
acknowledge the assistance received from technicians, students,
secretaries, and administrative staff under the sometimes difficult
and unsettling conditions of a newly formed bureau.

ACTIVITIES AT ROCKVILLE
Regulatory Biology

Regulatory Biology primarily emphasizes laboratory research to
determine how environmental stimuli such as light, temperature,
and various chemicals are perceived by plant cells and micro-
organisms. Studies are made of the mechanisms and processes reg-
ulated by these stimuli and the specific means by which they con-
trol growth and differentiation.

Plants sometimes have a control mechanism that enables them
to detect the length of the day. This process, photoperiodism, or
the control by light (photo-) of the seasonal reproduction (-period-
ism) in plants, is affected by the spectral quality of sunlight. Some
plants require daylengths greater than some critical minimum in

Science / 141
order to flower and are called long-day plants, while others re-
quire daylengths shorter than some critical maximum and are
called short-day plants. Nonphotoperiodic plants are called day-
neutral and reproduce at some fixed time relative to when germi-
nation occurred or to a change in temperature (thermoperiodic).

Many economically important crops, such as cereals (with the
sole exception of sorghum), belong to the long-day group. Experi-
ments with barley have shown that the response to increasing
daylengths is markedly stimulated by including light that is just
beyond that which the human eye can detect (called far-red or
near-infrared light). It is believed that the basis for the photo-
periodic control in these plants is the coincidence of a light signal
with an internal biological clock, which determines the sensitivity
of the plant to the presence of far-red light. Thus, not only must
light of the proper spectral quality be present, but it must be
present at the right time in order to promote flowering.

Once the proper light signal is perceived by a plant, a series of
biochemical reactions is initiated in the leaf that ultimately results
in the production of some translocatable signal that transforms the
shoot apex into a reproductive structure, a flower. This light signal
that strikes the leaf is absorbed by a pigment, phytochrome, that is
present in plants that are capable of forming the green pigment
chlorophyll used for photosynthesis.

Preliminary experiments carried out several years ago at the
Smithsonian by Dr. M. Ziv, a visiting scientist from the Hebrew
University in Israel, suggested that in peanut seedlings, the elonga-
tion of the female supporting structure (peg), which carries the
developing peanut below ground, is controlled by light. In addition,
development at the end of the peg of the ovule, embryo, and finally
mature pod is controlled by light. She suggested the peanut peg
might be an analogous model system to study signal transmission
in comparison to flowering.

This year the maturation of the peanut embryo has been demon-
strated to be strictly controlled by phytochrome located in the ma-
ternal, ovular tissue and not in the embryo itself. Thus, like the
photoperiodic signal, something produced in one tissue in response
to light must be translocated to another tissue to control develop-
ment. The localization of this phytochrome in peanut ovules and
embryos is being investigated by immunocytological staining to
determine whether the interorgan distribution of phytochrome can
explain the observed light regulation of this response.

The chemical nature of the signal produced in the leaves that

142 / Smithsonian Year 1984
brings about flowering is unknown. It moves in the phloem trans-
port system from leaves to the plant apex. Phloem sap was collected
from Perilla (Asiatic mint) leaves exposed to increasing numbers of
inductive short days. In Perilla it takes a minimum of seven short
days to induce some flowering. Extracts of this phloem sap have
been made. One peak in the neutral ethyl acetate fraction is pres-
ent in phloem from flowering plants but is not present, or is in very
low amounts, in vegetative phloem sap. This peak appears between
three and six days after the beginning of inductive short days. This
material is being accumulated by high-pressure liquid chromatog-
raphy and will be tested for its effect on flowering when added to
vegetative plants.

Extraction experiments using duckweed (Lemna) have generated
several peaks of activity from Lemna gibba G3 plants that have
flower-inducing activity when tested on Lemna paucicostata 151.
One of these active peaks was identified collaboratively with Pro-
fessors Takimoto and Takahashi of Japan as nicotinic acid. The
remaining peaks have not yet been identified. Experiments have
begun to measure nicotinic acid in flowering and vegetative plants.

When Lemna gibba G3 is grown under long days either on a
complete E (modified Hoagland’s) medium or on an ammonium-
ion-free half-strength Hutner’s medium to which ten micromoles
of salicylic acid have been added, excellent flowering of 75-80 per-
cent occurs. If plants are kept on these media for seven days and
then are transferred, still under long days, to an ammonium-ion-
free half-strength Hutner’s medium without salicylic acid being
present, the long day-induced flowering persists much more than
the salicylic acid-induced flowering. (This transfer medium used
from the beginning would bring about almost no flowering.) This
result suggests that salicylic acid does not exert its effect by caus-
ing the formation of the flowering stimulus in the same way long-
day induction does. Salicylic acid is known to be quickly inactivated
and sequestered after being taken into plants. It probably never
reaches the meristems that are directly exposed to the medium.
Therefore, we conclude that salicylic acid sets into motion some
change that can mimic the effect of the flowering stimulus and can
lead to flower formation.

In the medium lacking salicylic acid, if the phosphate concentra-
tion is increased ten to twentyfold, flowering of 40 to 60 percent
occurs. Suboptimal concentrations of salicylic acid interact syner-
gistically with phosphate to promote flowering. Salicylic acid prob-
ably stimulates phosphate uptake or alters phosphate metabolism.

Science / 143
Experiments on the uptake of carbon-14 labelled salicylic acid
continue. A peak at the origin on thin layer chromatography plates
from the acidic ethyl acetate fraction becomes very prominent with
uptake periods of longer than six hours. Earlier studies had over-
looked this material. It is being assayed to determine if it is a
bound form of salicylic acid and whether it has flower-inducing
activity.

Last year evidence was reported from radioimmunological assays
that plant extracts contain insulinlike materials. This year two
different insulin bioassays also yielded good activity. However, this
insulinlike material is different from any mammalian insulin that
has been tested. In addition, somatostatin-like activity has been
found in extracts of both duckweed and spinach. Somatostatin is
an animal peptide hormone that regulates release of insulin and
glucagon from the pancreas in man.

The light-absorbing pigment, phytochrome, that perceives these
stimuli is a protein, and it can be isolated and purified from dark-
grown rye seedlings. It can exist in two relatively stable forms. On
purified material the light activation process can be studied under
controlled conditions. An area on the surface of the protein mole-
cule changes shape after exposure to light. This area has been pro-
posed to be the chemically active site involved in the first step of
phytochrome-mediated responses. The binding of a number of de-
fined chemical probes to this site has been examined this year.
Both hydrophobic and ionic groups become more exposed to the
exterior of the protein after exposure to light. However, the chemi-
cal function of this site has not yet been identified. Phytochrome
molecules isolated from both oat and pea seedlings contain a simi-
lar site on the protein surface.

It has long been known that light energy striking red or blue-
green algal cells is absorbed by accessory pigments, phycobilipro-
teins, transferred to photosystem II of photosynthesis and then
distributed to photosystem I. Characterization has continued of the
oxygen-evolving, phycobilisome-photosystem II particles that were
isolated for the first time last year from the red alga Porphyridium
cruentum. In both red and blue-green algae, the phycobilisomes
exist on the external (stromal) surface of the photosynthetic thyla-
koid lamellae. Grana stacks and chlorophyll a/b complexes do not
exist in these organisms. Thus, the seemingly less complex thyla-
koid structure in Porphyridium and the direct energy transfer path-
way from phycobiliprotein to photosystem II provide a promising

144 / Smithsonian Year 1984
system for exploring the structural relationship of photosystem II
with its accessory pigment, phycobilisome, antenna.

The isolated particles have very high oxygen evolution rates and
a greatly reduced chlorophyll content. The average ratio in the par-
ticles is sixty chlorophyll molecules per phycobilisome as compared
to about 1,200 chlorophyll molecules per phycobilisome in the un-
fractionated thylakoid membranes. Photosystem I is greatly re-
duced in these particles. Electron microscopic observations con-
firmed that the particles are relatively homogeneous and that
typical thylakoid membranes are absent. The electron microscopic
fields showed phycobilisomes, often in clusters of two or three,
that had small appendages seemingly at the base of the phycobili-
somes. Thus, these particles from Porphyridium are different from
the other photosystem II-enriched particles in that they have one
of the highest oxygen-evolving rates thus far observed, and unlike
other preparations, they have functional coupling of the intact
phycobilisome with the photosystem II thylakoid system.

Phycobilisomes from the blue-green alga Anacystis nidulans
were studied for the wild type and several spontaneous mutants
were selected for improved growth in far-red light. By electron
microscopy, the thylakoid area of wild type and the 85Y mutant,
as well as the phycobilisome size and morphology, were deter-
mined. The size of phycobilisomes of wild type cells were larger
than those of the 85Y mutant. The number of phycobilisomes per
cell, calculated from the phycobiliprotein content and phycobili-
some size, was about the same in wild type grown in white light
and 85Y mutants grown in far-red light. However, the number of
phycobilisomes per unit area of thylakoid increased by almost two-
fold in cells grown in far-red light.

A large portion of the chloroplast is composed of membranous
sacs (thylakoids) in which the electron transport reactions of pho-
tosynthesis take place. Some of the polypeptides of the thylakoids
are made in the chloroplast on chloroplast ribosomes. These chloro-
plast-synthesized polypeptides are translated from messenger ribo-
nucleic acids (mRNAs) that are coded for by the chloroplast
genome. Chloroplast ribosomes are attached to the thylakoids, but
are also present in the chloroplast ground substance (stroma).
Spinach is being used to investigate the possibility that the thyla-
koid-bound ribosomes are specifically synthesizing polypeptides
that are cotranslationally added to the thylakoids.

Work is continuing on the site of biosynthesis and addition to

Science / 145
the thylakoids of the polypeptide that is the reaction center of
photosystem I (apo CP 1). It is an integral membrane polypeptide.
mRNA for apo CP I was found to be largely associated with thyla-
koids. Also, thylakoids with attached ribosomes synthesized apo
CP I. The newly synthesized apo CP I remained with the thylakoids
at termination of protein synthesis. Synthesis of apo CP I was
determined by immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized radio-
active apo CP I with specific antibody against apo CP I. However,
only a small portion of specific immunoprecipitable radioactive pro-
tein migrated on acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the position of
authentic apo CP I. Therefore, confirmation of localization within
the chloroplast of apo CP I mRNA, and of synthesis of apo CP I
by thylakoids with bound ribosomes, is being sought. For this pur-
pose a portion of the apo CP I gene (apo CP I probe) has been
isolated from a cloned segment of chloroplast DNA containing the
gene for apo CP I. The apo CP I probe will be used to determine
the sub-chloroplast localization of apo CP I mRNA, and for isola-
tion of apo CP I mRNA.

Work on the site of synthesis, and on the addition of polypep-
tides to thylakoids has been extended to a second integral thylakoid
polypeptide, the polypeptide of the proteolipid component of thy-
lakoid translocating ATPase (proteolipid). Proteolipid was isolated
from thylakoids and antibody (anti-proteolipid) was prepared. It
was found that thylakoids with bound ribosomes synthesized poly-
peptide that was immunoprecipitated with anti-proteolipid. The re-
sult indicates that at least some of the proteolipid is synthesized by
thylakoid-bound ribosomes.

In the fungus Neurospora crassa, blue light is required for the
induction of carotenoid pigment biosynthesis. Phytoene, a colorless
precursor of the carotenoid pigments, accumulates in dark-grown
cultures. Hence, it has been postulated that enzymes after phytoene
in the pathway are regulated by light. It has also been shown, how-
ever, that enzymes before phytoene in the pathway are photo-
regulated.

The conversion of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to phytoene
in Neurospora crassa requires both a soluble and a particulate frac-
tion. The soluble fraction catalyzes the formation of geranylgeranyl
pyrophosphate (GGPP) from IPP. This activity is drastically re-
duced in an albino-3 mutant. The particulate fraction catalyzes the
conversion of GGPP to phytoene. In a wild-type strain of Neuro-
spora, a blue-light treatment of the mycelia causes a tenfold in-

146 / Smithsonian Year 1984
crease in the particulate enzyme activity, while the soluble activity
increases twofold.

This year the photoregulation of GGPP synthesis has been stud-
ied in more detail. The conversion of IPP to GGPP requires at least
two enzymes, IPP isomerase and GGPP synthetase. To assay
GGPP synthetase it is necessary to separate it from the isomerase.
This has been accomplished using hydroxylapatite chromatog-
raphy. Also by this procedure, GGPP synthetase has been sepa-
rated from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthetase, an enzyme
that catalyzes the formation of FPP which is used as a substrate
for sterol synthesis.

Using hydroxylapatite chromatography, it was found that an
in vivo blue-light treatment causes an increase in GGPP synthetase
activity without any apparent effect on FPP synthetase or IPP
isomerase. Furthermore, GGPP synthetase activity is present at a
much lower level in an albino-3 mutant than in the wild type, while
the other two enzymes were present at wild type levels.

The discomycete fungus Pyronema domesticum forms apothecia
(reproductive structures) in white light in closed Petri dishes and
in the absence of circulating air in an incubator. Ultraviolet-A
radiation (320 to 420 nm) at an intensity of 104 microwatts per
square centimeter was found this year to be the effective region
of the white light that induces large numbers of apothecia in
sealed flask cultures. Mycelial growth was inhibited at intensities
that induce apothecia formation. Exposure to intense ultraviolet-A
radiation (4030 microwatts per square centimeter) results in death
of the mycelium. Apothecia was found to form also in the dark in
stagnant air in the presence of activated charcoal. Apparently,
volatile substances released by the fungus are inhibitory to apothe-
cia formation. This inhibition is removed by adsorption to the
activated charcoal but the chemical nature of the inhibitor is un-
known.

Mature sporangiophores (Stage IV) of the fungus Phycomyces
blakesleeanus give weak and erratic gravitropic responses when
placed in a horizontal position. However, it was found that if
sporangiophores are exposed horizontally to gravity during
younger developmental stages (Stages II and III) in which the cells
do not elongate or give a gravitropic response, subsequent gravi-
tropic responses observed in Stage IV have a shorter and more uni-
form latency. This early exposure to altered gravitational orienta-
tion causes the sporangiophore to develop a gravireceptor as it
matures to Stage IV and resumes elongation.

Science / 147
Sporangiophores are allowed to develop this increased sensi-
tivity by balancing a blue-light-induced phototropic response
against the gravity-induced geotropism. An optical microscopic
technique was developed to observe the spatial relationship be-
tween the vacuole and protoplasm of a living sporangiophore once
this photogeotropic equilibrium was established. The thickness of
the cytoplasmic layer is thinner on the upper surface of the cell
than on the lower surface. It is believed that this increased cyto-
plasmic thickness is involved in developing increased geotropic
sensitivity and causes increased growth on the lower side of the
sporangiophore with a subsequent positive geotropic response.

Environmental Biology

The opening of the pores on leaves (stomates) that allow for the
entry of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis has been thought to be
regulated by blue light or red light that is effective for photo-
synthesis. Newly obtained data indicate that the far-red portion of
natural sunlight interacts with an internal rhythm of the leaves to
control pore size. This far-red light has been found to be most
effective when other qualities of light are simultaneously present.
Thus, the amount of far-red light present is apparently the sig-
nificant cue enabling plants to carry out maximum rates of photo-
synthesis under natural conditions.

Measurements of the carbon dioxide gas conductivity controlled
by the stomata (pores) on primary leaves of bean seedlings dem-
onstrated that phytochrome modulates light-induced stomatal
opening. Removal of the far-red absorbing form by exposure to
far-red light decreased the time required to reach maximal open-
ing following a dark to light transition, as in sunrise. Removal of
the far-red absorbing form of phytochrome also decreased the
time required to reach maximal closure following a light to dark
transition, as in sunset. Removal of the far-red absorbing form of
phytochrome is brought about by greater quantities of far-red light
in the sunlight spectrum relative to the red portion of the spec-
trum. Sufficiently high far-red to red ratios of sunlight occur at
sunrise and at sunset.

The photosynthetic productivity of plants is regulated by the
amount of carbon dioxide available. The absolute carbon dioxide
concentration measured above the tropical forest on Barro Colo-
rado Island in the Republic of Panama indicates that there is an
annual increase of 1.5 parts per million, a value that correlates

148 / Smithsonian Year 1984
well with values found at other global stations. Measurements of
carbon dioxide exchange and monitoring of amounts of photo-
synthetically active radiation, temperature, and wind velocity have
been carried out for one year on Barro Colorado Island, sponsored
by an Environmental Science Program grant. These data will com-
prise the formation of baseline data to ascertain the effects of
changes in these parameters with other continuing ecological
studies on the island.

Initial carbon flux rates, using gas measurements and eddy cor-
relation techniques, indicate a 20 percent greater productivity rate
in the tropical forest than those measured by conventional leaf
litterbox collection techniques of gathering leaves, fruits, and twigs
that drop from trees or visual estimation techniques of ascertain-
ing the extent and change of the forest leaf canopy. The param-
eters measured were found to have a very high correlation coeffi-
cient with the carbon flux rates measured for this initial year of
operation. The measurements will continue to test the validity of
these correlations of growth as influenced by carbon dioxide con-
centrations available to the forest canopy.

Plants occupying coastal wetlands have to overcome several
stressful environmental factors, one of which is salt. The dominant
plant species in this ecosystem, Spartina alterniflora (Common
Cordgrass), has the ability to tolerate salt concentrations three to
four times that of seawater. The typical response to such high salt
levels over many seasons is for the plants to be diminished in
height by an order of magnitude.

In attempting to understand the physiological basis for this
dwarfing response, the reaction of the photosynthetic apparatus of
this plant to salinity and other factors has been examined. The
working hypothesis is that adaptations to high salt concentrations,
lack of oxygen, and perhaps other characteristics of this plant’s
habitat are at least partially an adaptation to water stress.

When the roots of S. alterniflora were flooded with water that
contained gradually increasing salt concentrations over a period
of twenty-four hours, the response of the plant’s photosynthetic
apparatus was different from a rapid, large increase in salinity.
When the step increase was large (i.e., from low salinity to sea-
water salinity) there was an immediate response in the stomata,
which limited the supply of COs to the intercellular spaces. When
the step increases were small, and the plant was given time to
adjust, the stomata played a very small role in limiting the supply
of COs. In the latter case, kinetic studies of light and CO2 showed

Science / 149
that the imposed stress affected the photosynthetic capacity (i.e.,
the maximum rate of COs assimilation) in high light conditions
and COs, but did not influence the rate of photosynthesis at low
light intensities.

Typically, increments in salinity of salt marsh soils occur over
periods of days, and are influenced by the frequency and intensity
of storms and by the tides. Thus, the ability of salt marsh species
to acclimate to changes in soil salinity within a twenty-four hour
period may be a crucial physiological adaptation for surviving
environmental stress.

Measurements of the amounts of ultraviolet sunlight received at
the earth’s surface show that there are periodic increases and de-
creases that are not caused by the activities of man or by volcanic
activity. Current data from land-based instruments operated by
SERC, indicate that these increases and decreases are due primarily
to differences in the amounts of ultraviolet produced by the sun.
Data obtained by National Air and Space Administration satellites
of solar radiation above the atmosphere support this finding.
Therefore, concerns about man’s role through the addition of
fluorocarbons that change the earth’s atmosphere by altering the
ozone concentrations, thus changing the amounts of ultraviolet
radiation transmitted, must be evaluated in terms of this informa-
tion. Instruments were installed late in fiscal year 1984 at Mauna
Loa Observatory in Hawaii in collaboration with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to measure ultraviolet at
the 11,000-foot level. These measurements in the relatively clean
atmosphere, remote from urban pollution, will provide a better
indication of the changes in ultraviolet resulting from atmospheric
changes specifically in the troposphere.

Long-term measurements of the color quality and amounts of
visible solar radiation over a fifteen-year time period have been
completed and indicate a remarkable stability for any given geo-
graphical location. This stability is true only for the visible portion
of sunlight and since most of the visible sunlight changes so little,
measurements are no longer needed in wide bands. These data pro-
vide an extensive base line available to future researchers. Instru-
ments designed and constructed by serc that measure in relatively
narrow bands in the visible portion of the spectrum have proven
to be very reliable, and their use will continue in measuring se-
lected bands of sunlight of interest for specific biological responses
such as photosynthesis or flowering.

Radiocarbon Dating

The radiocarbon dating laboratory operates within the Regulatory
Division, performing basic research in radiocarbon dating as well
as providing service datings of archeologically interesting artifacts
for the museums.

Studies of the relative rise of sea levels in the Gulf of Maine
over recent time periods has continued. A large discrepancy in the
radiocarbon dates for shell-midden sites along the shore of Passa-
maquaddy Bay in coastal Maine prompted an investigation of rela-
tive sea level rise in the area as a result of crustal warping. Tide
gauge records and documented photographic records indicate that
while the relative sea level is rising a few centimeters per century
in western New Brunswick, that rise amounts to nearly a meter
per century in eastern coastal Maine. In cooperation with the Uni-
versity of Maine, cores of salt marsh peats have been taken at
numerous sites along coastal Maine, and are being dated to pro-
vide a more extensive chronology of sea level rise. Initial evidence
suggests that a similar rapid rise took place in this region between
2,500 and 2,000 years ago. A geologic fault line separating the
two areas indicates continued geological instability.

ACTIVITIES AT EDGEWATER
Environmental Biology

The principal objective of serc’s environmental biology program is
the study of environmental processes in estuarine and watershed
systems. Observational and manipulative studies are designed to
develop and test ecological concepts at the macroscopic process
level (landscape, habitat, community, or population). Emphasis is
placed upon studies of how biological communities are developed
and maintained over time. The need for such research is increas-
ingly critical in a world where chronic disturbance is causing
major reductions in the productivity and diversity of environmen-
tal systems. The primary site for this long-term, intensive research
is the Smithsonian property on the Chesapeake Bay (tidal Rhode
River and its watershed). The site includes a mixture of land uses
typical of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, as well as freshwater and
brackish tidal wetlands, and an estuarine tributary to the Chesa-
peake Bay. This environmental diversity and the long-term control
of the property make the site exceptionally suitable for a variety
of studies of the complex processes linking terrestrial and estu-

Science / 151
arine systems. Comparative studies are also conducted at a wide
range of secondary sites, to test the generality of research results
from the primary site.

Genetic and Morphological Diversification of Salamanders

Although salamanders are often considered to be characteristic of
the north temperature zone, more than half of the world’s sala-
mander species actually live in the New World tropics. In the most
recent phase of a long-term comparative study, involving scientists
from the Smithsonian Institution, the University of California
(Berkeley), and the University of Chicago, patterns of genetic and
morphological similarity were compared in salamanders of the
genus Pseudoeurycea that inhabit the Transverse Volcanic Range
of south-central Mexico. Previous evolutionary studies of this
group had been hampered by superficial similarities in the appear-
ance of even distantly related species, but the separation of en-
zymes by starch-gel electrophoresis and the analysis of detailed
morphological measurements has made it possible to sort out much
of the complex genealogy of these salamanders.

As a result of this research, a distinctive new species (Pseudo-
eurycea longicauda), was discovered and described, and the rela-
tionships of P. leprosa, P. robertsi, and P. altamontana were clari-
fied. P. leprosa consists of a number of morphologically similar,
but geographically isolated, populations that inhabit the highest
volcanic peaks and ridges in south-central Mexico. Genetic com-
parisons indicate that some presently isolated populations have
been separated only since the Pleistocene era, while others have
not exchanged genetic material since early Pliocene times. At the
other extreme, P. robertsi and P. altamontana are sufficiently dif-
ferent in appearance to have been placed in different species
groups by previous workers, but electrophoretic comparison of
enzyme variation in these two species suggests that they have
diverged only within the last 1-2 million years.

Ecology of Cranefly Orchid

Long-term studies of the Cranefly Orchid (Tipularia discolor) in
a deciduous forest at the center’s research site in Maryland are
revealing the complex nature of a plant species’ adaptations to its
environment. Because this plant produces one corm (an under-
ground storage organ) per year, which persists for several years,
and also has distinct reproductive and vegetative seasonability, it

152 / Smithsonian Year 1984
was chosen as the subject of a study on how plants allocate their
resources in a natural population. Corms older than one year lose
weight gradually during the year and most vegetative growth goes
into current year corms. Leaves and sexual reproductive structures
account, at peak weight, for approximately 20 percent of the total
plant. The largest percentages of nutrients were found in corms
two years older, and nutrient concentrations were also high in
newly formed leaves and flowers. Analysis of the weight and nu-
trient data suggests that translocation is important, but it does not
account for all of the uptake in new growth. Plants must, there-
fore, assimilate nutrients from the soil during periods of growth.
The results suggest that large, belowground nutrient storage pools
are maintained for purposes other than providing nutrients for
pulses of growth.

Effects of Forest Fragmentation on Birds

Man’s use of the landscape often results in habitat fragmentation,
which has diverse ramifications for the animals dependent upon
the affected habitat. One of the long-term studies at the center has
addressed the question: To what extent has man’s alteration of the
eastern deciduous forest on the coastal plain impacted breeding
bird populations? Point surveys were used to estimate the abun-
dance and diversity of breeding forest birds in relation to the size,
degree of isolation, floristics, physiognomy, and successional ma-
turity of 270 upland forest patches in the coastal plain province
of Maryland. Physiognomic and floristic characteristics of the tree,
shrub, and herb layers of the forest were measured at each site.
The local abundance of almost every bird species breeding in the
interior of upland forests was found to be significantly influenced
by forest area, isolation, structure, or floristics, or combinations
of these factors. Highly migratory species tended to be most
abundant in extensive stands of mature, floristically diverse forests
that were only slightly isolated from sources of potential colonists.
Densities of permanent residents and short-distance migrants
tended to be less affected by these site characteristics, or had
responses opposite in sign to those of long-distance migrants.
The impacts of forest fragmentation on bird populations are
complex and species-specific. Many bird species respond strongly
to factors other than, or in addition to, forest patch area and iso-
lation. Dissection of the landscape into small highly isolated
patches of forest adversely affects some bird species, but struc-

Science / 153
tural and floristic characteristics of the forest are more important
than patch size and isolation for many species, given the existing
distribution of forest patches in the coastal plain of Maryland.

Agricultural Herbicides in Runoff

Today most farmers utilize preemergent herbicides (weed killers)
as a part of row-crop management. These compounds avoid the
necessity of mechanical weed control while the crop is developing
after planting. Serc has conducted extensive research upon the
fate of these chemicals in order to evaluate their potential for
nontarget effects in receiving waters. Two commonly used herbi-
cides in cornfields of the Rhode River Watershed are atrazine
(2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino,1,3,5,-triazine) and ala-
chlor (2-chloro-2’,6’-diethyl-N-methoxymethyl acetanilide). Al-
though alachlor was applied in larger quantities, atrazine was de-
tected more frequently in runoff waters and had greater concen-
trations than alachlor (0-40 vs. 0-6 parts per billion (ppb)). Atra-
zine was more persistent and more mobile in watershed soils. Con-
centrations in discharges were not closely related to agricultural
land-use. Runoff waters from forested watersheds where herbi-
cides were not directly applied were contaminated with herbicides
as a result of atmospheric transport and spray drift. During the
three-year study period, a maximum of ten ppb of atrazine, and
up to 0.5 ppb alachlor were discharged in winter runoff waters
from the eight experimental watersheds, indicating the importance
of flow degradation and complex transport mechanisms. In addi-
tion to reflecting the quantity of herbicides directly applied to land
surface, residual herbicide levels in runoff waters must be influ-
enced by other important factors such as topography and location
of croplands in relationship to drainage channel. A major portion
of atrazine was found to be in solution in runoff-water samples
collected during storm events. Percolation in subsurface flow and
dissolution in overland flow were believed to be important trans-
port mechanisms.

Displacement of Alkaline Ions by Acid Rain

In recent years, environmental scientists in several locations have
gradually perceived the importance of chemicals that enter vari-
ous ecosystems in precipitation. To a considerable extent this con-
cern has resulted from the documentation of steadily increasing
acidity in rainfall. This increased acidity in precipitation is pri-

154 / Smithsonian Year 1984
marily due to increasing concentrations of sulfur and nitrogen
oxides in the atmosphere. In such places as Sweden, the White
Mountains of New Hampshire, the Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina, the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee, the Rocky
Mountains of Colorado, and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of
New Mexico, research reports have documented and summarized
both ion inputs in precipitation and ionic losses in land discharge.
Differences between ionic inputs and outputs can then be ascribed
to the interactions of vegetation and soils with chemical com-
ponents in the precipitation. Most of these published studies were
conducted in mountainous regions with low human populations and
limited land management. None were in the Atlantic Coastal Plain
of the United States. An understanding of natural (i.e., unman-
aged) systems is theoretically important, but of limited value when
extrapolations must be made to complex, multiple-land-use sys-
tems. Understanding nutrient dynamics on a multiple-land-use
basis is critically important for wise management of the land. The
most abundant land uses on the Rhode River Watershed, as else-
where on the Atlantic Coastal Plain are forest, cropland, and
pastureland. Since no calcareous minerals are found in watershed
soils, the latter are poorly buffered against acid rain inputs.

Ionic inputs in precipitation and farm chemicals were measured,
as were ionic outputs in land runoff from the principal land-use
categories. Patterns of ionic composition were also traced along
pathways of surface runoff during storms and soil water percola-
tion between storms. The results from this research confirm other
studies that have found a trend of increasing acidity in rainfall, as
well as important regional differences in its effects. It is clear that
at the Rhode River site, increased hydrogen ion inputs are dis-
placing the essential plant nutrients of Mg++, Cat+, and Kt.
Although displacement rates are apparently low, available nutrient
pools in forested areas could be depleted in a few decades, causing
ecologically significant effects. Ion losses appeared to be propor-
tional to the magnitude of disturbance associated with the three
land uses studied. Thus, total cation and anion outputs were low-
est at the forest site, similar but somewhat higher for the pasture-
land, and significantly greater in the cropland discharge than in
either of the other two. Concentrations in the receiving streams
closely approximated the discharge-weighted concentrations of
surface and groundwater, indicating that analysis of these different
flow pathways through a watershed is an important key to under-
standing the origins of the final output concentrations.

Science / 155
The functional importance of streamside forest in reducing ni-
trate concentrations in discharge from an agricultural watershed
was clearly shown, raising interesting questions as to the general-
ity of this result. Other questions raised by this study are the
importance of Fe, Mn, and Al ions in intra-watershed patterns of
ion change, and the problem of what measures should be taken to
best compensate for Kt, Mgt*, and Cat? losses.

Tidal Exchange of Nutrients by Marshes

The ecological role of marshes in regulating nutrients, sediments,
and microorganisms in adjacent tidal marshes has attracted the
interest of many environmental scientists in recent years. In an
effort to help clarify this role, seErc scientists measured and com-
pared exchanges by two types of brackish tidal marshes that differ
in surface elevation and, therefore, frequency of flooding. Both
types of marsh tended to import particulate matter and export
dissolved matter, although they differed in the fluxes of certain
nutrients. Compared with tidal exchanges, bulk precipitation was
a major source of ammonia and nitrate and a minor source of
other nutrients. There was a net retention of nutrients by the por-
tion of the Rhode River that included both marshes and mudflat.
However, the marshes accounted for only 10 percent of the phos-
phorus retention and 1 percent of the nitrogen retention, while
they released organic carbon amounting to 20 percent of the re-
tention. This suggests that the mudflat, which was interacting with
the marshes by tidal exchange, acted as a major sink for nutrients.
The primary role of the marshes seems to be transformation of
particulate nutrients to dissolved form, rather than net retention
or release of nutrients. The exchange of bacteria and algae via tidal

water movements was also studied. A small net import of bacterial
and algal cells into both types of marsh was measured, but only an
insignificant portion of the total nutrient transport was due to the
nutrient content of these cells.

Bacterial Movement in Marsh Sediments

Environmental scientists have been attempting to determine mech-
anisms and pathways of nutrient movement in tidal marshes. One
hypothesis is that significant movement occurs as microbial cells
suspended in the brackish water percolate through marsh sedi-
ments. Concentrations and sizes of bacteria in sediments were

156 / Smithsonian Year 1984
determined. Their concentrations in percolating water were found
to be less than 1 percent of the number adhering to sediment par-
ticles. The concentrations of bacteria in water flooding the marshes
was also higher than in waters leaving the marshes in ebbing tides.
Thus, movement of bacterial cells doesn’t seem to be a major mech-
anism of nutrient movement in marsh sediments.

Smithsonian Office of Educational Research

Effective October 1, 1984, the Smithsonian Office of Educational
Research (sor) was established to investigate and improve learn-
ing as it occurs outside the formal educational system. Recognizing
that schools alone are not equipped to address all the educational
needs of America today, the soer is engaged in promoting educa-
tional endeavors at all levels and in diverse settings in the belief
that lifelong learning habits can only be established with the sup-
port and participation of a broad spectrum of society.

People can, and do, learn in a wide variety of situations, although
some are more conducive to the transfer and acquisition of infor-
mation than others. The soer represents a unique opportunity for
studying how people learn outside of traditional educational
venues, i.e., schools, and was created in response to the need to
investigate informal learning as it occurs in settings such as mu-
seums, zoos, and natural areas. It is notable that in the United
States, hundreds of millions of people annually visit museums. Far
exceeding in attendance all spectator sports combined, museum
visitation represents one of the most popular out-of-the-home rec-
reational activities in America, and yet an understanding of how
museums function as educational institutions is not yet fully devel-
oped.

As an environment that facilitates rather than directs learning,
a museum can profoundly influence paths of educational pursuits,
arouse interest, inspire appreciation, promote scientific and cultural
literacy, and offer an avenue for lifelong learning opportunities.
While few professionals would deny this assertion, supporting evi-
dence, based upon empirical research, is woefully lacking.

Staffed with research psychologists and education specialists, the
SOER has initiated studies to examine how people learn in a wide
variety of social and physical contexts and is particularly interested

Science / 157
in the role of the family in learning. The Smithsonian Family Learn-
ing Project (srtp), which has developed science activities for fami-
lies to do together at home, has received enthusiastic responses
from tens of thousands of families as well as unsolicited national
publicity. Srip activities will be widely available for the first time
in the form of a poster-sized wall calendar this fiscal year, and a
series of stp booklets are soon to be published.

Funded by the National Science Foundation and using a spe-
cially developed research method, a study on “The Role of the
Family in the Promotion of Science Literacy” is nearing comple-
tion, following observation research conducted at the National
Museum of Natural History. This fiscal year, the National Science
Foundation funded a Community-based Science Project that will
attempt to integrate expertise afforded by a variety of community
representatives, including teachers, scientists, technicians, parents,
and children into a concerted effort directed toward enhancing all
participants’ awareness and appreciation of science as it relates to
society and technology today.

Another project, being conducted at the National Zoological
Park, is concerned with the development and testing of orientations
for families visiting the Small Mammal House. The materials will
be tested for their effectiveness in enhancing the educational value
of family visits to a zoological exhibit. Other family-related re-
search efforts include studies at the National Museum of Natural
History in Washington, D.C., and the National Museum of Natural
History in New Delhi, India.

Results of sorr studies concerning the dynamics of behavior and
learning among museum visitors and families have been and will
continue to be useful to professionals in education, exhibit design,
and family services nationwide. Findings are disseminated through
publications, seminars, and workshops for both professional and
lay audiences.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Introduction

The comparative method plays an essential role in biological under-
standing, and the tropics, with their unparalleled diversity of plants
and animals, offer by far the most fruitful opportunity for compari-

158 / Smithsonian Year 1984
son. Moreover, tropical conditions are near the norm for most of
the earth over most of the last few hundred million years, while
conditions typical of modern “‘temperate” zones have been far more
restricted or ephemeral. Research in the tropics, where the preci-
sion of adaptation and the intricacy of interdependence reach their
height, will accordingly play an essential role in any attempt to
understand life in its full and proper context.

It is therefore an urgent duty to become sufficiently acquainted
with the denizens, plant and animal, of tropical habitats, to be able
to bring them to life for a wider public. Only if rain forests and
coral reefs come alive in people’s minds and imaginations can we
hope that tropical habitats will not be wiped out, unheeded and
unrecognized, as part of the macabre sacrifice of the “less devel-
oped” world to the “developed.” We have yet to complete Adam’s
task of naming the animals and plants; even a name, as Parmenides
saw so long ago, helps bring something to life in men’s minds, and
is a necessary first step toward understanding. There is so much
more to do.

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (str1) is well placed
to help achieve the required understanding. Its primary advantages
are:

(1) Administration of, and access to, the Barro Colorado Nature
Monument, a 5,400-hectare reserve of tropical forest, some of it
primary, surrounding the central part of the Panama Canal. This
reserve offers an unparalleled array of background information and
previous research on which to build.

(2) A position athwart a narrow isthmus between two very dif-
ferent oceans, offering abundant opportunities for comparative
study.

(3) Extensive resources to support research—financial assistance
for students, suitable laboratories and equipment, a research vessel,
and an unusually good library.

(4) A staff with worldwide experience in tropical research, and
a group of students, postdoctoral fellows, and recurrent visitors
committed to intensive tropical research.

The quality of the student contribution, and the importance of
adequate support for students, cannot be overemphasized. In 1984
Phyllis Coley, now of the University of Utah, won the Ecological
Society of America’s Mercer Award for her thesis research on
Barro Colorado Island, published in Ecological Monographs. This
award is given to that young ecologist with the best ecological re-
search published in the United States or Canada during the past

Science / 159
two years, and is the “highest form of recognition for published
ecological research.” In 1981 Nigel Franks, of the University of
Leeds, won Britain’s Thomas Henry Huxley award for thesis re-
search on Barro Colorado.

Systematics

Helping others to recognize plants and animals, past and present,
is a significant part of str1’s research. Robert Dressler is continuing
his studies of orchid taxonomy. Dolores Piperno is continuing her
work with phytoliths, silica inclusions in plants that persist in the
soil when the plant decays, and whose shapes reveal the order or
family, and sometimes the species, of the plant that formed them.
Daniel Suman is studying carbonized particles from more than
forty common species of grasses and twenty species of trees to see
whether these species can be recognized from the fragments they
release into the air when the plants are burned. David Roubik,
Enrique Moreno, and Robert Schmalzel are preparing a “pollen
flora” of Barro Colorado Island, which will allow students of bees
to learn what species of plants bees are taking pollen from, students
of flowering rhythms to learn the seasons when different species
of plants are opening their flowers (by periodically sampling the
pollen bees bring back to their hives), and paleobotanists to recon-
struct the past history of vegetation from the layers of pollen de-
posited at the bottom of a lake or bog. Nancy Garwood, in collab-
oration with staff members of the British Museum (Natural
History), has begun a seedling flora of Barro Colorado Island and
adjoining parts of Panama, which will enable students of forest
regeneration to identify seedlings of dicotyledenous trees, shrubs,
and lianas. Joseph Wright and Hugh Churchill are preparing a
flora and avifauna of the Contreras Islands, just off Coiba, which
is the largest island off the Pacific Coast of Central America.

The Origin and Nature of Biological Diversity

A more prominent theme in stri’s research is to understand the
origin and document the nature of biological diversity, and to learn
how it is maintained.

William Eberhard has just completed a book on the evolution of
genitalia. He finds that in almost any animal with internal fertiliza-
tion, genitalia evolve steadily and rapidly, reflecting the advantage
of any innovation that excites fuller reproductive response from

160 / Smithsonian Year 1984
the female, even if there is no need for the species to develop sex-
ual habits sufficiently distinctive to avoid mating with members of
related species.

Genitalia accordingly provide a very convenient and effective
means for distinguishing between species. More generally, William
Eberhard’s work supports the view of Charles Darwin that specia-
tion reflects “accidental” divergence of isolated populations, reflect-
ing their different response to sexual selection, rather than direct
selection to prevent different populations from hybridizing.

Mary Jane West-Eberhard has been studying tropical insect so-
cieties, with an eye toward understanding some puzzles concerning
the apparent suddenness with which species appear in the fossil
record. Living in groups leads to social competition, which is often
intense enough to dictate alternative specializations. Animals lack-
ing the size and experience needed to “win the competition” for
mates or food often have behavior patterns that allow them to cir-
cumvent the competition. When, for some reason, one specializa-
tion becomes disadvantageous throughout the population, might
the newly unbalanced selection for the other lead to a sudden “evo-
lutionary jump?”

Robert Warner, of the University of California at Santa Barbara,
has been studying blue-headed wrasses, fish that live on coral reefs
of the San Blas Islands, off the Caribbean coast of Panama. Most of
these fish are born female, and turn into bright-colored territorial
males when large enough to compete effectively for females. Some,
however, are born as female-colored “drab” males, which secure
matings by stealth, rather than through open competition, illustrat-
ing the “alternative specializations” just mentioned. They, too, turn
into bright-colored territorial males when old enough to do so.
Warner has been concerned with how “tradition” affects where on
a reef the blue-head males set up their spawning territories. He
finds that exchanging all territorial blue-heads between a pair of
reefs does not affect where the territories are formed, and exchang-
ing all fish of both sexes requires the spawning territories to be
chosen anew. They are formed, as before, at the downcurrent end
of the reef, so that fertilized eggs will quickly be swept away from
the reef and its predators, but the territories are obviously different,
suggesting that tradition does matter.

Eric Fischer, of the University of Washington, has been studying
the social behavior of a coral reef fish, Serranus baldwinii, in the
San Blas Islands. Young adults are hermaphroditic, carrying male
and female sex organs, both functional, but when they grow larger

Science / 161
they turn purely male, assume brighter colors, and maintain harems
of hermaphrodites.

He has also been studying Serranus tortugarum, a fish that main-
tains functional organs of both sexes all its life. These fish spawn
in pairs, the members of a pair exchanging sex roles in successive
spawning bouts, as if trading eggs for each other to fertilize. They
often pair with the same mate for days on end. However, in con-
trast to the hamlets, Hypoplectrus, which Fischer studied earlier,
these fish also dart in to fertilize eggs released by other mating
pairs, and if they arrive too late to fertilize those eggs, they some-
times try to eat them instead.

Ken Clifton, of the University of California at Santa Barbara,
has been studying the social behavior of the striped parrotfish, a
small parrotfish common in the San Blas Islands. A large female
has one or more smaller females in its territory. She apparently per-
mits this because they help defend the territory against conspecifics,
rather than for any help more eyes might give in watching for
predators. This contrasts with insectivorous birds of the tropical
forest understory, some of which feed in flocks of several species
to take advantage of each other’s vigilance.

Arcadio Rodaniche has been studying the reef squid Sepioteuthis
in the Indo-Pacific, to compare their social behavior with the Sepio-
teuthis he studied with Martin Moynihan in the Caribbean. These
squid have ten times more behavioral displays than most birds or
mammals. This extensive repertoire is made possible by their daz-
zling ability to change both hue and color pattern very rapidly. He
has also been studying the social behavior of two harlequin octopi,
Octopus cherchiae and Octopus sp., in the laboratory. These octopi
are striped all over: their color pattern is more intricate, and more
permanent, than those of most cephalopods, and their capacity to
change color is restricted to adjusting the darkness of their pattern.
Their social displays are accordingly of unusual interest. He also
found that Octopus cherchiae reproduces more than once in its
life, one of the very few cephalopods to do so.

Ira Rubinoff, Jorge Motta, and Jeffrey Graham have been em-
ploying ultrasonic transmitters to track Pacific sea snakes to learn
how long and how deep they dive. They have been observed to dive
as long as four hours, and as deep as twenty-six meters. In Panama
Bay it appears that sea snakes dive to shallower depths during the
dry season, when upwelling often moves the 20°C isotherm closer
to the surface. It is not known why they dive, although they are

162 / Smithsonian Year 1984
obviously well adapted to do so: they do not feed while they dive,
and they do not dive to escape predators.

Eldridge Adams, a predoctoral fellow, has been studying man-
grove ants at Galeta, str1’s mainland Caribbean field station. First
he sampled 100 trees, ten meters apart, then 500 trees partitioned
over several forests, for their ant communities. He found that trees
with the rather aggressive small ant Azteca tended to lack Crema-
togaster and vice versa. Zacryptocerus, on the other hand, tends to
occur with Azteca, following them to food: Zacryptocerus appar-
ently has a form and odor that the Azteca cannot sense. Adams has
also been studying interactions between Azteca colonies and be-
tween Azteca and Crematogaster, employing manipulative experi-
ments where appropriate. Interactions between ant colonies are
easily studied in mangrove forest, because the ants interact above
ground where they can be seen.

Jacqueline Belwood, another str1 predoctoral fellow, has been
studying various facets of the ecology and behavior of insecti-
vorous bats, particularly bats that glean insects from foliage. She
has followed seasonal changes in the diets of various foliage-glean-
ing bats that take their prey back to their roosts before eating them:
she judges their diets from the wings the bats drop to the forest
floor while feeding.

She has also discovered that one bat, Tonatia sylvicola, is at-
tracted to calling male katydids but, instead of eating the calling
male, it eats the females the male attracts. Moreover, she has dis-
covered a bat, Myotis nigricans, whose call starts so slowly that a
“fast Fourier transform” program cannot pick up its onset (al-
though the program has no difficulty with the call when played
backward). She inferred that moths could not hear its onset either,
and verified that the bat lives entirely on moths.

She has also studied the various ways katydids attract mates
without being eaten: they may call rarely, or call from places the
bats cannot get to, or attract mates by vibrating their perches in a
manner that their conspecifics sense but the bats cannot.

With James Fullard, of the University of Toronto, Jacqueline
Belwood has been preparing a catalogue of recordings of the echo-
location calls of the various bats on Barro Colorado Island, and
they have now recorded thirty-two of the fifty-three species of bats
on the island. This is the most complete “echolocation profile” yet
given for a tropical bat community, and comparison of a bat’s echo-
location call with where, what, and how it hunts promises greatly

Science / 163
ee understanding of the function of different echolocation
calls.

Ola Fincke, a str1 postdoctoral fellow, has been studying the
ecology and reproductive behavior of three species of giant damsel-
fly, one Megaloprepus and two Mecistogaster. They all lay their
eggs in water-filled tree holes, where their nymphs live on mos-
quito wrigglers and small tadpoles. Large adult males of the genus
Megaloprepus establish reproductive territories around tree holes
in light gaps, allowing females to lay eggs in “their” holes in return
for a mating. Many more females visit tree holes in light gaps than
those in deep shade. Males cease defending tree holes in the dry
season, even if the holes are artificially replenished with water, but
they are always capable of mating. Mecistogaster adults, on the
other hand, appear to meet and mate by chance, and Mecistogaster
ornatus undergo reproductive diapause in the dry season.

Stephen Mulkey has been studying three species of small forest
bamboo, following the demography of selected populations in the
forest and testing their responses to light level and nutrient avail-
ability in the growing house. He found that the light-demanding
species is most tolerant of drought, and the shade-tolerant species
least so, while, on the average, the third species is less tolerant of
drought than the light-demander. This study is an unusually care-
ful test of Robert MacArthur’s notion that the “jack of all trades is
master of none,” and indeed, the third species grows markedly less
well in shade than the shade-lover and is somewhat less tolerant of
drought than the light-demander. The third species is also more
flexible developmentally, putting out very different leaves in sun
and shade.

David Roubik has been studying the pollen diet of honeybees,
both feral African and European, at various sites in Panama, as
part of his study of the impact of invading feral African honeybees
on native bee communities.

He also visited eleven countries in Asia during a three-month
trip, looking at stingless bees (meliponines) and honeybees. He
found that there are more species of stingless bees in southeast
Asia than in the dry forest of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, even though
the Asian stingless bees coexist with two species of honeybee.
Some Asian stingless bees forage aggressively, driving other spe-
cies of bee, and in one case, even conspecifics, away from flowers,
and some “steal” pollen without fertilizing flowers. He also ob-
served the species of giant honeybee in Nepal, the only species of
honeybee restricted to the north temperate zone.

Seasonal Rhythms of Tropical Communities

It is important not only to realize the diversity of adaptation in
tropical plants and animals, but to see how they fit together in the
life of the community as a whole. On Barro Colorado, life in the
forest is dominated by a seasonal alternation of drought and heavy
rainfall, which imposes a seasonal rhythm on plant growth and
reproduction and entails a seasonal alternation of feast and famine
for the animals. Seasonal rhythms are less obvious in marine com-
munities, but are not absent there.

Peter Becker, working with Philip Rundel of ucta, has been look-
ing at seasonal rhythms of leaf production, studying the relation
between leaf production and water potential in plants illustrating
three major rhythms of leaf production:

(a) those that start putting out new leaves in February, and fin-
ish flushing about the time the rains come in April,

(b) those that flush new leaves just after the rains come, and

(c) those that are putting out a few new leaves through the year.

He finds, as one would expect, that plants have lower water
potentials (reflecting greater water stress) in the dry season, both
at dawn and at midday, than in the rainy season. More surprising-
ly, the predawn water potentials of plants in the old forest of the
central plateau of Barro Colorado Island are three to four times
lower than those of plants on slopes of Lutz Ravine, near the lab-
oratory clearing (— 12 compared to — 3 bars). Apparently liberal
watering during the dry season of four species of understory
shrubs and saplings in Lutz Ravine did not increase their growth
rate.

Eugene Schupp has been studying factors affecting the timing
and vigor of flowering and fruiting in the common understory
treelet Faramea occidentalis. Schupp finds that Faramea which pro-
duce lots of seed produce a higher proportion of good seed: an indi-
vidual with 1,000 fruits will have 300 sound ones, while an indi-
vidual with 8,000 will have 5,200 sound fruits. A large fruit crop
apparently “swamps” the insects that parasitize the seeds. More-
over, Faramea which produce few flowers and fruits one year gen-
erally produce many the next.

Iguana show a very sharp seasonal rhythm. Females come to
places with bare earth to lay eggs near the end of January and be-
ginning of February, and hatchlings emerge at the beginning of the
rains, when new leaves are most abundant. Stanley Rand and his
associates have completed a fifth season of catching and marking

Science / 165
female iguanas that have come to lay eggs on “Slothia” and other
islets surrounding Barro Colorado: some animals have nested on
Slothia for five successive years. This year’s hatching was the most
abundant and successful of the last four.

Natasha, the four-meter-long crocodile that used to nest on
Slothia and harass the iguanas digging near her nest site, died in
November 1983, and in 1984, a smaller female crocodile took over
the laboratory cove.

Enrique Font radiotracked eight iguanas for six months, and
found that they have very restricted home ranges. The six males
never ventured more than a few score meters from where they
were first marked. One adult female traveled more than a kilo-
meter, the other, over 500 meters, to nest. They returned to their
original ranges after several weeks, and stayed there.

Katherine Troyer finds that “middle-aged” iguanas lay more
eggs than either very young or very old ones. She and George Zug
have clipped the toes of several hundred iguanas, from which clip-
pings they can assess the ages of the iguanas.

In Chiriqui, Robert Schmalzel has been studying the rhythms of
flowering in plant communities along an altitudinal gradient from
sea level to 3,000 meters, periodically sampling the pollen honey-
bees bring back to their hives at a suitable variety of sites. Together
with David Roubik’s work in central Panama, this is the first at-
tempt to delineate the role of honeybees in tropical plant commu-
nities. Generally, he finds that bees do have quite an impact on
their communities. Stingless bees eat many kinds of pollen so
efficiently that a broad spectrum of flower types are restricted
either to the highlands, where stingless bees do not reach, or to
opening at night, when these bees do not fly. Coping with over-
greedy bees plays a previously unsuspected role in flower evolution.

Donald Windsor, Jeff Burgett, Ricardo Thompson, and John
Cubit have been calculating the frequency and the seasonal distri-
bution of those calm spells during low tides that expose the reef
flat at Galeta to the sun, with such devastating consequences for its
populations. They have found that wind and waves, as well as the
tidal level, affect the prospect of an exposure. Exposures are not
predictable, but are most likely to happen during a calm spell at
the end of the dry season or the early part of rainy season.

Jeff Burgett has been studying seasonal rhythms of plant cover
on the reef flat at Galeta, some of which reflect the seasonal distri-
bution of the exposures just mentioned. He finds that the alga
Laurencia dominates the reef flat for eight months of the year, but

166 / Smithsonian Year 1984
An overheating of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific during El
Nifio of 1983 resulted in die-off of the coral reefs in the Gulf of Chiriqui.
The white areas indicate Pocillopora spp. that have lost their tissues. In
1984 Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute biologists cored the reefs to
determine whether a similar die-off had occurred in the past 300 years.

Adela Gomez, who served the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute for
thirty-nine years, is honored on her retirement. Shown here, from left to

pologist; Mrs. Gomez; and Ira Rubinoff, director of STRI.

that when the reef flat is exposed to the sun, the Laurencia die
back. They persist as resistant crusts, and a fuzzy mat of aufwuchs
develops in its place, providing a feast for a variety of small crabs.
The aufwuchs do not retard the regrowth of Laurencia in any way.

The Perils of Recruitment

One of the greatest problems for many tropical organisms is sur-
mounting the perils of youth. The life of pelagic larvae of marine
organisms, and the types of problems they face, are very poorly
known indeed, nor do we have any idea how events in the plank-
ton shape the distribution and abundances of the visible adult
organisms that make up a marine community. Our knowledge of
tropical tree seedlings is not much better. The major theories of
tropical tree diversity hinge on conflicting sets of assumptions
about the most important factors affecting seed and seedling sur-
vival and seedling growth, yet our ignorance of the problems these
seedlings actually face is such that we cannot decide the relative
merits of the theories concerned.

John Christy has been studying the reproductive cycles in four
species of crabs of rocky intertidal shores on the Pacific side.
When do they release their larvae? What roles does timing of
release play in helping the larvae to avoid predators?

Species with small, transparent larvae release them at high tide,
no matter what time of day the tide may occur: since the larvae
are “invisible,” the one thing that matters is to flush them out to
sea on an ebbing tide. Large transparent larvae are released only
on nocturnal high tides, when at least some predators are absent.
During the day, sardine (anchoveta) packs come inshore and feed
greedily on crab larvae, but the sardines disappear at dusk, when
their predators emerge. Species with more opaque larvae release
them only on those high tides that begin ebbing near dusk. Estua-
rine species do likewise. It was once thought that by doing so, the
estuarine species released their larvae upon the strongest tides,
ensuring the greatest chance that they would be flushed past the
inshore predators and out to sea, but the advantages of releasing
larvae when they could enjoy several hours of invisibility and of
protection from predators might also affect the timing.

Robert Richmond has been studying coral reproduction and re-
cruitment in the Eastern Pacific. He finds that Pocillopora dami-
cornis, the common branched coral of the Eastern Pacific, do not
reproduce sexually in Panama: instead, they reproduce by frag-
mentation, apparently because larvae and very small corals are

168 / Smithsonian Year 1984
invariably eaten. Fish apparently prey far more heavily on corals
in the Eastern Pacific than in the Indo-Pacific, where Pocillopora
reproduce sexually. The very few coral larvae that do appear on
settling plates in the eastern Pacific may have drifted in from the
Indo-Pacific.

David Hamill has been carrying out an experimental study of
the factors affecting survival and growth of the seedlings of the
four most clumped, and the four most evenly dispersed, species of
canopy trees on the fifty-hectare Hubbell-Foster plot on Barro
Colorado Island. For each species, he planted twenty plots of seed-
lings by large trees of that same species, ten in light gaps, ten
under Trichilia tuberculata (the commonest tree on the plot), and
one each under ten different species of rare trees, the same ten
for each kind of seedling. Early results suggest that the most
clumped species depend most on light gaps, and cannot survive
as seedlings outside those gaps, while the most evenly distributed
species are the most shade-tolerant.

As part of his study of Virola surinamensis, Henry Howe, of the
University of Iowa, has measured the survival rate of seeds and
seedlings placed at different distances from the parent tree. A
seedling twenty-five meters from the parent, well beyond its
crown, has twenty-two times the chance of surviving to twelve
weeks, and a seedling forty-five meters from the parent, forty-four
times the chance of surviving that long, as a seedling five meters
from the parent. He infers that dispersal by toucans, which carry
seeds further than smaller birds, is beneficial to Virola, and tou-
cans are indeed the primary consumers of Virola fruit and dis-
persers of Virola seeds. Eugene Schupp finds that dispersing a
Faramea seed five meters from its parent doubles its chance of
germination.

Joseph Wright has been collecting seeds to learn what insects
emerge from them. Nearly half the seventy species of plants
checked so far never have insects in their seeds, perhaps because
the seeds are too small, or too few per plant, or on too rare a
plant, to support such insect pests.

He has also continued his study of the relation between the
timing of fruit production by the palm Scheelea and the degree to
which bruchid beetles damage their seeds. He has put out seeds at
different places, and at different times of year. No bruchids come
to seeds put out far away from palms, or when no palms are fruit-
ing. Bruchid attack rate immediately steps up to a high level when
Scheelea start dropping fruit, and remains high past the peak of

Science / 169
Scheelea fruit fall, but palms which drop their fruit late in the
season escape bruchid damage.

Geographical Comparison

Not only must we set an organism’s adaptation in the context of
other plants and animals with which it interacts, we must put our
understanding of the community in the context of comparable
communities elsewhere, and of the same community at different
times.

Alan Smith visited Kenya in the fall of 1983 to continue his
study of the demography of alpine tree Senecio, as part of a long-
term comparative study of the morphology and demography of
rosette plants in Venezuela, Kenya, and New Guinea.

Marina Wong has been studying the seasonal rhythm of insect
and fruit abundance, and of the number of birds caught in mist-
nets, in the understory of old forest on Barro Colorado Island and
of somewhat younger forest on the adjacent mainland. She is
comparing these rhythms with those found in peninsular Malaysia.
There is more fruit in Panama, with more birds to eat them. More-
over, judging the season of breeding by when birds call, when
their fat is depleted, and when “brood patches” appear, she finds
that breeding of the insectivorous birds in Panama’s understory is
synchronous within species, but that the breeding seasons of dif-
ferent species are staggered all through the rainy season. In penin-
sular Malaysia (and Sarawak), where dry and wet seasons are
much less distinct, breeding of nearly all understory birds is con-
centrated at the beginning of monsoon rains, coincident with the
peak of leaf flush and insect abundance. She also finds that con-
specific plants fruit more synchronously, and more abundantly,
here than in Malaysia, and that there is a more clear-cut succes-
sion of different species coming into fruit as the rainy season
progresses than in Malaysia.

Long-Term Research

A temporal context for research at str1 is provided by our Environ-
mental Sciences Program, directed by Donald Windsor. This long-
term study monitors fluctuations in selected aspects of climate and
the physical environment, and the responses, in growth, reproduc-
tive activity, and abundance of representative biological popula-
tions, at both the reef flat of Galeta and Barro Colorado Island.
In connection with this program, Henk Wolda has completed ten

170 / Smithsonian Year 1984
years of records of nightly catches of insects at two light traps,
one in the canopy and one near the ground. By now Dr. Wolda
has ten years of data on homoptera and nine on forest cock-
roaches. He finds that tropical insect populations fluctuate as much
as their counterparts in the temperate zone. He has extended his
study to other sites, and is gradually acquiring collaborators capa-
ble of identifying additional groups of insects.

There are other long-term studies at str1. Over the last few
years, Stephen Hubbell, Robin Foster, and their associates have
mapped every woody free-standing plant over 1 cm dbh in a fifty-
hectare plot of old forest on the central plateau of Barro Colorado
Island. This year, Hubbell and Foster have rechecked the identi-
fications and locations of plants on their plot, preparing for a
second round of mapping and measurement to determine mortality
and growth rates. To assess height growth, Kenneth Lertzman
remeasured the height of canopy foliage over a series of points
five meters apart covering the plot, where Andrea Alexander and
others had measured it a few years earlier.

The popularity of such maps is spreading. Stephen Hubbell is
scheduled to assist Peter Ashton and members of the Forest Re-
search Institute at Kepong, Malaysia, in setting up a comparable
map in a Malaysian lowland mixed dipterocarp forest. Meanwhile,
Joseph Wright and Henry Howe mapped a hectare of the Mojave
Desert—7,000 plants over ten centimeters high—to judge the de-
gree of clumping within a species and the degree of association
between species, and to take the first step toward a study of the
demography of desert plants.

The Hubbell-Foster plot has attracted a variety of other projects.
Perhaps the most unusual is that of Lyn Loveless, who has been
assessing the genetic diversity of different species of trees on the
plot in conjunction with James Hamrick of the University of
Kansas. What proportion of loci in the different species are poly-
morphic? How many alleles are there per polymorphic locus?
What proportion of an individual’s loci are heterozygous? How
much do gene frequencies within a species differ from clump to
clump, or from place to place? How does the type of pollinator
affect genetic diversity or local differentiation? So far, Loveless
and Hamrick have found the average proportion of heterozygous
loci in their tropical trees to be at least 0.11, about the same
as in Drosophila melanogaster and 50 percent higher than in man-
kind. These trees are less diverse genetically than temperate coni-
fers, but about as diverse as temperate dicots. They have also found

Science / 171
that populations of the tree Alseis blackiana several kilometers
apart differ rather subtly in allele frequencies, while clumps of
Rinorea that far apart differ greatly. Rinorea has as patchy a dis-
tribution as any common species on the island.

Neal Smith has continued his long-term study of the migratory
day-flying moth Urania. He visited Guatemala, Belize, and Los
Tuxtlas, Mexico, and found that in all these countries Urania
caterpillars eat leaves of the tree Omphalea oleifera, in contrast to
Panama, where their food plant is the vine Omphalea diandra.
He saw Urania arriving at Los Tuxtlas, the northern end of their
range, where Omphalea and the rain forest stop—they were com-
ing in from the south and east—and the leaves of the Omphalea
trees were much shredded. A month later, the Urania were gone,
and the Omphalea were flushing new leaves unhindered.

After many years of sampling bird use of forest habitat in
Parque Nacional Soberania, James Karr expanded his studies to
include several of the major food resources of birds. Recent sam-
pling coincided with the 1983 (“El Nifio”) drought and the “nor-
mal” 1984 dry season. Flowering and fruiting phenologies of
understory plants differed from year to year. There was more leaf
litter but fewer leaf litter and foliage arthropods were found in
1983 than in 1984. Birds showed different patterns of breeding
but not molting phenology between the years. Clearly, the climatic
extremes of 1983 had direct impact on a wide diversity of or-
ganisms.

John Cubit and Donald Windsor have been estimating long-
term changes in sea level, and assessing their effects on the biota,
from aerial photographs and other records. The mean sea level on
the Caribbean side has increased fifteen centimeters in the past
century. It may well rise another 200 centimeters in the next,
thanks to heating of the oceans and consequent expansion of the
water contained therein, and to the melting of icecaps.

Dolores Piperno has cored several sites in the old forest of
Barro Colorado Island, in the Hubbell-Foster plot, and started an
archeological trench at the most promising site. Three of her five
cores struck pottery, beginning twenty centimeters below the sur-
face. The silica inclusions (phytoliths) that remain in the soil after
the plant matter in which they were formed decays show little
sign that the vegetation was intensively disturbed: there are few
traces of milpa vegetation, and almost no evidence that any of the
forest was burned. The top fifteen centimeters of soil, which con-
tains no pottery, also contains no evidence that farms were cleared

172 / Smithsonian Year 1984

—S
from the forest during the last several hundred years, suggesting
that some of the forest on Barro Colorado Island may be older than
previously thought. The trench shows good stratigraphic record,
with plenty of artifacts, stones, and ceramics, to document a
human presence, although populations appear never to have been
dense. Radiocarbon samples are being submitted to determine the
age and duration of the prehistoric occupations. Extension of this
work will indeed enable us to set the forest community of Barro
Colorado Island in its proper historical context.

Biological Catastrophes

As we acquire more experience of our habitats, we are better able
to recognize and appreciate the catastrophes to which they are
sometimes subject.

Harris Lessios, John Cubit, and Ross Robertson have been
studying the progress of a devastating plague in Diadema anitil-
larum, the long-spined sea urchin of the Caribbean, and its conse-
quences for reef communities. This plague was first noticed at
Galeta, our mainland Caribbean field station, where only about
three per ten thousand survived. The plague next struck the San
Blas, where it killed 99 percent of the urchins in two weeks,
mortality varying somewhat from place to place. Through ques-
tionnaires, Lessios and his collaborators have tracked the plague’s
progress around the Caribbean, where, for the first nine months
at least, it was clearly following the surface currents. Some algae
have appeared since the die-off, apparently thanks to the absence
of Diadema. The plague did not affect other species of sea urchins.

An overheating of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific dur-
ing the El Nifio of 1983 afflicted the coral Pocillopora with heavy
mortality. Peter Glynn, R. Dunbar, G. Wellington and R. Rich-
mond have been following its effects. Ramparts of the many-
branched Pocillopora often surround more massive corals, and the
commensal crabs and shrimps that live in these Pocillopora make
life so miserable for the coral-eating starfish Acanthaster that
these starfish can neither eat, nor cross, colonies of Pocillopora.
Now that El Nifio has killed the Pocillopora, causing their com-
mensals to starve, Acanthaster are wreaking havoc on the newly
accessible massive corals. Some of these coral colonies had grown
evenly and without interruption for over a century before this
El Nifio, suggesting that the last El Nifio of comparable effect
struck more than a century ago. To follow up this clue, Peter
Glynn and his associates have been drilling massive corals, check-

Science / 173
ing fluctuations in carbon-isotope ratios for evidence of previous
warm-water episodes.

Neal Smith has been following the fates of the thousands of
Peruvian boobies that came to the Bay of Panama from the nor-
mally very productive waters off the Peruvian desert, and the
15,000 blue-footed boobies that came from somewhat less pro-
ductive waters near the Galapagos, to escape the famine carried
their by the El Nifio. Some of the blue-footed boobies bred, but
eventually all the immigrants disappeared. Most of them probably
starved to death.

The Role of Man in Tropical Habitats

Finally, we are concerned with the relation between tropical man
and his habitat, both as it is, and as we hope it might become.

Olga Linares visited the archives of French West Africa in Paris,
to study the history of the Diola rice trade in Senegal from the
sixteenth century onward. The Diola were actively trading in rice
when the Portuguese were in Senegal, but the French elected to
import rice from their south Asian colonies rather than improve
local transport sufficiently to make Diola rice competitive with the
foreign imports. This is an unusually clear example of how colonial
policies have shaped present-day patterns of production and ex-
change in tropical countries.

Daniel Suman is analyzing charcoal particles chemically isolated
from two cores from a floodplain in Cocle, a core from the bottom
of the Bay of Panama and a core from the bottom of the Laguna
(Lake) San Carlos in El Valle. With the aid of his collection of
carbonized fragments from plants of known identity, he will infer
the changes in the types of vegetation that have been burned dur-
ing the last 10,000 years, in order to assess the impact of mankind
on the vegetation of Central Panama.

The W. Alton Jones Foundation gave stri a large grant two
years ago to support research in a mainland tract adjacent to Barro
Colorado Island on how to grow food in the forest without de-
stroying the forest unnecessarily. Gilberto Ocafia has been experi-
menting with “mixed crops,” growing crops of several species and
growth forms, whether exotic or traditional, mixed together in
regular array, on forest plots, some with a selection of the under-
story trees left standing, some completely cleared. Nicholas
Smythe has built the installation where he will breed pacas, and
he has fenced off a peninsula of young to medium second growth,
where he will see what schedule and manner of supplemental food

174 / Smithsonian Year 1984
will most decrease infant mortality and most increase the output
of pacas big enough to eat. Dagmar Werner has tried a more direct
way of averting infant mortality in iguanas: she incubates the
eggs and raises the young in cages at Summit Garden before intro-
ducing them to the forest. Hatching success has been very high,
and mortality among the young iguanas almost negligible. She
intends to use some of the iguanas she has raised to repopulate
areas where they have been hunted out, and to release others in
forest tracts where they can be cropped. She is conducting experi-
ments to see how well iguanas raised in captivity can survive in
the wild.

Ira Rubinoff and Elena Lombardo have been representing stRI
at meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the Study of Alter-
natives to the Panama Canal. Shuffling between Panama, Wash-
ington, D.C., and Tokyo, this committee is charged with designing
a study to examine alternatives or improvements to the Panama
Canal. Some of these options have potential for profound anthro-
pogenic effects on the tropical environment, and our objective is
to insure that a comprehensive biological inventory as well as an
ecological impact assessment is conducted.

Retirements and New Appointments

It has not been an easy year for stri1. In March, Adela Gomez
retired. During the last thirty-odd years her good sense, and her
diplomatic ability, have been essential to stri’s function and some-
times to its very survival. In May, Michael Robinson left the
Institute to assume the directorship of the National Zoo. His sure
scientific judgment and his sense of fairness made his administra-
tive role at stR1 particularly beneficial, and his scientific research
added much to the sense of intellectual excitement here. They will
both be greatly missed.

Bernadette French resigned from the library staff in December
1983 to continue her education. This September, Carol Jopling will
retire as head librarian at str1. She has presided over the introduc-
tion of new techniques of cataloguing and bibliographic searching.
She supervised the move to a new and larger building, and because
of her, these changes were much easier for users of the library
than they might otherwise have been.

Not all has been loss, however. James Karr, formerly of the
University of Illinois, has joined str as deputy director. Jeremy
Jackson, of Johns Hopkins University, and Nancy Knowlton, of
Yale University, have accepted positions on the staff as marine

Science / 175
biologists, and their presence will greatly strengthen our marine
program.

In August 1983 Jorge Ventocilla, a biologist and graduate of
the University of Panama, took charge of stri’s Office of Con-
servation and Environmental Education (ocre). Under his direction
the oceEE, in conjunction with the Department of National Parks
and Wildlife of RENARE, produced a color poster on the endan-
gered fauna of Panama. This poster has been distributed to nu-

merous educational centers and public and private offices through- ~

out Panama; it has had an acknowledged importance in promoting
the protection of endangered species. Along with his work in the
oceE, Ventocilla presently acts as a coordinator for the planning
group of the San Blas Kuna Indians’ conservation project.

Academic Training

A milestone this year was the first field course in tropical biology
organized jointly by str1 and the University of Panama. It took
place from March 9 through April 10, and was coordinated by
Yael D. Lubin, a stri research associate, and Rosemary Segistan
and Victor Hugo Tejera, professors at the University of Panama.
The University of Panama and str1 signed an agreement in
1980 to jointly support the advancement of knowledge in tropical
biology, and the course represented a tangible example of this col-
laboration during a year dedicated to scientific research at the
university. Thirteen students and thirty-one lecturers and instruc-
tors participated. The students were introduced to field research
methodology at four different sites, chosen to represent diverse
tropical habitats: tropical rain forests, Atlantic and Pacific man-
groves, and premontane forests. It proved to be an effective way
to make scientific resources at sTRI available to students in our
host country.

During the month of February, Robert Read, a visiting scholar
from San Jose State University, offered two ten-hour seminars:
Tropical Meteorology and Applied Oceanography. These were at-
tended by staff and students at str1 and the University of Panama,
and personnel from the Meteorological Branches of Panama’s In-
stitute of Hydraulic Resources and Electrification and the Depart-
ment of Natural Renewable Resources.

Robert Dressler left in July to teach an advanced course on
orchid taxonomy at the University of Costa Rica.

More than sixty young men and women at different academic
levels took part in advanced training and research activities at

176 / Smithsonian Year 1984
stRi this past year. They represented nations in the less-developed
and developed world—a sample of future tropical researchers.

Finally, this year str1 began the first phase of a master plan.
The architectural and engineering firm of Bernard Johnson of
Houston, in association with Lopez y Moreno of the Republic of
Panama, were selected to prepare the plan. This process should
lead to orderly expansion, modernization, and broadening in the
spectrum of service that str1 can provide for its staff, students,
and visiting scientists.

The initiation of the master planning process confirms the com-
mitment of the Smithsonian to develop its role as the nation’s
principal advanced study center for basic tropical biological re-
search.

Anacostia Neighborhood Museum

This year the primary focus of the Anacostia Neighborhood Mu-
seum (ANM) was on plans to build and furnish a new annex and
public space. Groundbreaking for this new facility, which will
adjoin the museum’s Research and Exhibits Lab, is projected for
early 1985. The annex will facilitate enrichment of the museum’s
exhibits and explanatory programs, and will allow for the presen-
tation of more diverse and active programs for the public.

For the past seventeen years, ANM has been housed in several
leased buildings. From the former Carver Theater (named for the
pioneer agricultural scientist George Washington Carver), at 2405
Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, SE, the museum’s director and
administrative staff moved to more suitable quarters at the Re-
search and Exhibits Lab. Until the new annex is completed, ANM’s
exhibitions and education department will continue to serve the
public in this interim leased building.

A third copy of Black Wings: The American Black in Aviation
was produced by the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum for the
Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Services (sires). Scripted and
researched by the National Air and Space Museum, this popular
exhibition—enhanced by selected artifacts and memorabilia—was
seen at aNM from April 1 to August 26, 1984. In addition, ANM
completed research and scripting for the revised edition of Black
Women: Achievements Against the Odds, an exhibition widely

Renaissance, a major exhibition scheduled to open in the fall of
1985; and began an important research project still in its pre-
liminary phase—’We Are Climbing’: The Development of the
Black Church, 1787-1900.

In the vanguard of the movement to develop quality exhibitions
that employ historical documents, artifacts, memorabilia, and vin-
tage photographs germane to Afro-Americana and ethnohistory,
ANM broadened its contacts with archival repositories and museum
professionals and offered the public unique opportunities to experi-
ence well researched, designed, and fabricated exhibits, as well as
thoughtfully conceived outreach activities.

Other priorities have been the planning for aNm’s future growth
at the Poplar Point site along the Anacostia River (Eastern Branch
of the Potomac), and the continued development of research pro-
grams that support museum and traveling exhibition programs.

Archives of American Art

Nineteen eighty-four marked the thirtieth anniversary of the
Archives of American Art, and as though in celebration of that
fact, some of the best acquisitions ever were received during the
year. The Jackson Pollock papers, a subject of protracted negotia-
tions conducted over the past decade, were donated to the Archives
by Pollock’s widow, Lee Krasner, shortly before she died. The
papers, which consist of statements, notes, and other writings by
Pollock, personal and business correspondence, and a large quan-
tity of photographs and published material, represent the chief
source of documentary information on the artist. In a separate
acquisition, the papers of the Portland, Oregon, painter, Louis
Bunce, several important Pollock letters written in 1946, add a
fascinating supplement to Pollock’s own records.

Another significant figure of twentieth-century modernism was
Mark Tobey, whose records are owned by the Seattle Art Museum.
Organized and microfilmed by the Archives, these, too, were sup-
plemented by the donation of a substantial group of Tobey letters.
A third major artist of the same period, Mark Rothko, is repre-
sented by a small but revealing set of notes from the 1930s and
1940s, including preliminary drafts of the 1943 polemical letter to

History and Art / 181
the New York Times in which Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb state
their artistic credo. Diaries, correspondence, and other records of
an earlier modernist, Arthur Dove, were also acquired in fiscal
year 1984.

Collections of papers from the nineteenth century are rarer than
those of our own time, but this year the Archives borrowed and
microfilmed several of extraordinary value. Among these is the
largest single group of Winslow Homer records—some 600 items
of correspondence, sketches, photographs, and a scrapbook—and a
splendid group of nineteen letters from Thomas Cole, written be-
tween 1826 and 1832 to the Hartford art patron Daniel Wads-
worth. Papers of three other leading early-nineteenth-century art
collectors, Robert Gilmor, Luman Reed, and James Robb, were also
filmed. The records of Samuel F. B. Morse, who achieved prom-
inence as an artist before he entered on his second career, exist in
vast quantity at the Library of Congress. The Archives, however,
has recently received seven Morse letters written to his Breese
relatives between 1816 and 1846. They include several references
to his painting, and one of them has a charming illustration of
Morse asleep in his chair. A few other Breese family letters are a
part of the group, the most interesting one, dated Philadelphia,
April 19, 1783, describing the effect of the news of peace, which
“like a Torrent, has overwhelmed all other news.”

Sketches and sketchbooks from the later nineteenth century in-
clude those of Ellen Day Hale and the black American painter
Edward Bannister. A long series of letters from Augustus Saint-
Gaudens to Frederick MacMonnies, two notable American sculp-
tors, cover the years 1884 to 1904, and in a later series, Gutzon
Borglum discusses his work on Mount Rushmore in detail. One
of the larger collections received this year is the Violet Oakley
papers, which document the long and productive career of a Phila-
delphia painter and stained-glass designer.

Art critics and art historians play their own role in art history
and their files often have substantial research value. Those of the
critic Clarence Joseph Bulliet and of the historian Edgar P. Rich-
ardson are prime examples. Bulliet was Chicago’s leading art critic
in the 1920s and 1930s and was an influential figure throughout
the Midwest. The papers, which include voluminous correspon-
dence together with his articles, drafts of his writings, and photo-
graphs, are a major source of information on the Chicago art
world over a quarter of a century.

In a particularly fitting acquisition for this thirtieth anniversary

182 / Smithsonian Year 1984
This photograph of Jackson Pollock (left) with his brother, Charles, about 1930,
was among the Jackson Pollock papers donated to the Archives of American
Art by the late artist’s widow, Lee Krasner, shortly before she died.
year, the Archives received the Edgar P. Richardson papers. An
eminent historian of American art, Dr. Richardson established the
Archives of American Art in 1954 and guided it through its first
decade of growth. His records embrace the entire range of Ameri-
can art history and thoroughly document his long career as
scholar, museum director, adviser to collectors, founding father,
and forceful presence in the museum community.

The Archives initiated several important collecting projects in
1984. A grant from the Henry Luce Foundation supported a pre-
liminary survey of American art records in Philadelphia and Rhode
Island, each with a view to microfilming selected groups of the
papers uncovered. A similar project in New Mexico concentrated
on personal and institutional collections in Santa Fe and Taos. In
a move beyond the national boundary, the Archives received per-
mission from the University Court of Glasgow University to film
its extensive group of J.A.M. Whistler papers.

A more permanent collecting venture was established this year
with the long anticipated opening of an office in Los Angeles.
This sixth regional center, housed in the new Virginia Steele Scott
Gallery of American Art of the Huntington Library and Art Gal-
lery, and supported by local contributions, will serve as a base for
both collecting and research in Southern California.

The Archives’ oral history program has been more than usually
productive. Two intensive projects, one documenting the art com-
munity of the Pacific Northwest and the other comprising an ex-
tended series of personal recollections of Mark Rothko, were con-
cluded this year. Continuing experiments with the video tape
medium brought visual interviews with David Hockney on the
West Coast and Gladys Nilsson and Jim Nutt in Chicago. An
earlier series of video tapes on three Chicago artists, made in
1983 with support from the Smithson Society, won a silver medal
award this year from the International Film and TV Festival of
New York. Among the more useful oral history interviews con-
ducted in fiscal year 1984 were ones with Aaron Bohrod, a Chi-
cago painter whose work has been well known for nearly fifty
years, with the contemporary painter Tom Wesselman, and curator
and art historian Robert Beverly Hale. In a new departure, the
Archives also interviewed an authentic visionary and folk artist,
the Reverend Howard Finster, whose swift rise to fame culmi-
nated in the presentation of his work at the Venice Biennale and
an appearance on the Johnny Carson show.

The volume of research conducted at the Archives of American

184 / Smithsonian Year 1984
Art in fiscal year 1984 rose by 10 percent over 1983, with 3,320
visits from graduate students, scholars, and independent art his-
torians. A similar 10 percent increase to 1,600 rolls of film oc-
curred in the interlibrary loan of Archives microfilm to researchers
at universities and museums throughout the country.

Publications with acknowledgements to the Archives appeared
in great quantity in 1984. These included books on Mary Cassatt,
Thomas Eakins, David Smith, and Louise Nevelson; on modernist
painting in New Mexico; on the political basis of abstract expres-
sionism; and on federal art patronage after World War II. Most
publications based on Archives materials are exhibition catalogues
and articles in scholarly journals. The Archives own publication
program brought forth The Card Catalogue of the Oral History
Collections of the Archives of American Art.

Several changes in design and content will be introduced in the
forthcoming issue of the Archives of American Art Journal. Its
appeal will be enhanced with a new look and new features, includ-
ing a book review department and a Letters to the Editor section.
As befits the quarterly publication of an archival institution enjoy-
ing an embarrassment of riches, the Journal will present an in-
creased number of particularly revealing and significant unpub-
lished documents, with introductory notes by expert authorities.
These will reflect the Archives’ important holdings in American
cultural and social history as well as in the history of art.

Many programs of the Archives depend upon private funding
and the commitment of private citizens throughout the nation.
The Archives pays special tribute to those members and trustees
who by dint of considerable effort and hard work raised in the
past year some $400,000 in general operating funds. Particular
appreciation goes to Mrs. Dwight M. Kendall of Los Angeles;
Mrs. Nancy B. Negley of San Antonio, Texas; and Mrs. Charles
Kessler of Huntington Woods, Michigan, each of whom raised in
excess of $70,000. Mrs. Kessler recently stepped down from the
chairmanship of the Detroit Committee for the Midwest Regional
Center, a position she held for nearly four years. The committee,
being the first such support group for the Archives, is one of the
most active in the country and has consistently raised major funds
for more than twenty-five years.

Further appreciation goes to A. Alfred Taubman of Troy, Michi-
gan; Mrs. Francis de Marneffe of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Mrs.
John Rosekrans of San Francisco; Mrs. Dana M. Raymond, Mrs.
Robert F. Shapiro, and Mrs. Otto L. Spaeth, all of New York City.

History and Art / 185
Each of them was responsible for either raising or attracting to
the Archives more than $25,000. Mrs. Spaeth, who has been an
active friend of the Archives since 1959, was named honorary
chairman of the board at the annual meeting of the trustees in
May.

Also during fiscal year 1984, the Archives acknowledged major
grants from the Henry Luce Foundation, Warner Communications,
Inc., the Brown Foundation, the Lehman Foundation, and The
Times Mirror Foundation. These funds, along with others, have
helped to support various collecting endeavors across the country
as well as several scholarly programs including a Senior Fellow-
ship and the Archives’ Journal.

Center for Asian Art
Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery

A sense of transition was much evident in the Freer Gallery of
Art in 1984. The beginning of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery with
the arrival of assistant director Milo C.| Beach, Islamic art scholar
and former chairman of the department of art at Williams Col-
lege, marked the transition to the Center for Asian Art, which
encompasses the Sackler Gallery. With the laying of the physical
foundation of the Sackler Gallery, the reality of its new building,
scheduled to open in 1987, appears as a turning point in the his-
tory of the Freer Gallery.

Further tangible evidence of the development of the Sackler
Gallery was the arrival of the first objects of the Sackler Collec-
tion, generously donated by Dr. Sackler to form the basis of the
new museum. Temporary space was prepared at the Museum
Support Center to hold the almost one thousand objects until their
relocation to the new building. Two groups of Sackler objects were
next scheduled to arrive after their exhibition at the Edinburgh
International Festival in Scotland. The entire collection was ex-
pected to reach Washington by the end of the calendar year.

The Freer was not without its own whirlwind of activity. Plans
for renovating the Freer building after the opening of the Sackler
Gallery began in a substantial manner. The ultimate goals of the
renovation are to provide the Freer with more collection storage

ties, and more teaching space.

Possibly the largest exhibition of work by James McNeill
Whistler in this country since the 1905 memorial show opened
at the Freer Gallery in May 1984, closing in December. For this
show marking the 150th anniversary of Whistler’s birth, visitors
arrived at more than double the normal rate to see the rare display
of oil paintings, watercolors, pastels, and pencil and ink drawings.
These works erased preconceptions of the artist as limited to por-
traits and nocturnes as the breadth of his interests and skills was
seen. In this exhibition a number of display techniques were used
for the first time at the Freer Gallery.

AT&T was the corporate sponsor for the Whistler exhibition
and, in particular, the exhibition catalogue, James McNeill
Whistler at the Freer Gallery of Art. Written by David Park Curry
and copublished with W. W. Norton & Company, the 304-page
catalogue was richly illustrated with over 700 photographs, in-
cluding over 200 in color, made possible by AT&T’s generous
grant. Besides clearly establishing the significant relationship be-
tween Freer and Whistler, the catalogue also describes the various
art historical connections of the works in the exhibition and will
be the primary statement on the Freer’s Whistler collection for
some time. A free color brochure, a free lecture, a scholarly sym-
posium with the National Gallery of Art, and two posters accom-
panied the show, along with special notecards with Whistler etch-
ings. The exhibition and catalogue were well received in national
as well as local media.

A photographic exhibition in the lower hall described the Freer-
Whistler relationship. This small show followed the photographic
exhibition on Charles Lang Freer and the Freer Gallery for the
sixtieth anniversary celebration.

To complement the Whistler show, a number of Chinese and
Japanese art objects in various media were selected to represent
possible pieces that either Whistler had seen or Freer had seen
while acquiring Whistler works. In addition, there were other
Chinese and Japanese exhibitions this year. Japanese Drawings
featured works by Katsushika Hokusai and Kawanabe Gyosai as
well as a large portion from the Grut Collection, acquired in 1975
and never before exhibited. Japanese Fans, which showed painted
fans of high artistic quality produced by some of Japan’s most
famous painters, was a reprise of the popular show of 1980.
Korean Influences on Japanese Ceramics exhibited fifty objects to

188 / Smithsonian Year 1984
examine the Japanese appreciation of Punch’ong ware, Korean
ceramics that entered Japan in the sixteenth century. Korean tech-
niques of applying slip to dark-bodied wares became major ele-
ments in the styles of ceramics centers founded by Korean potters
in Japan and spread in various forms elsewhere in that country.

Chinese Paintings exhibited a selection of thirty paintings span-
ning the Sung dynasty (960-1279) through the Ch’ing dynasty
(1644-1912). This exhibition included two recently accessioned
works by Tao-chi, a seventeenth-century painter with a wide repu-
tation in the West. This show was followed by Masterpieces of
Chinese Painting, exhibiting thirty important works from the Sung
through the Ch’ing dynasties to complement the Treasures from
the Shanghai Museum exhibition at the National Museum of
Natural History.

In the Near Eastern field, Islamic Manuscript Illumination ex-
hibited nineteen folios produced in Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, and
Uzbekistan between the tenth and sixteenth centuries. The show
provided a perspective on the decoration of religious and secular
manuscripts. Pre-Islamic Metalwork from the Near East exhibited
twenty-four objects in silver, gold, and bronze, made in Iran and
Egypt, from the 4th century B.C. to the 6th century A.D., includ-
ing Sasanian Iran (224-651) and nine gold objects from Egypt.

The thirty-first annual lecture series focused on “Studies in
Connoissership 1923-1983” as a continuation of the Freer’s six-
tieth anniversary theme. These lectures included: “Early American
Collectors of Japanese Art,” by Julia Meech-Pekarik, which was
jointly sponsored with the Embassy of Japan; the Rutherford J.
Gettens Memorial Lecture, ““Red, Yellow and Blue: The Story of
Three Asian Pigments,” delivered by Elisabeth West FitzHugh;
and “New Light on the Falling Rocket: Whistler at Cremorne
Gardens,” by David Park Curry.

The inaugural lecture for the John A. Pope Memorial Lecture
Series was “Transitional Blue-and-White: Some Reflections on
Style,” by Margaret Medley, curator of the David Foundation,
London.

The Freer’s docent program proved so successful in terms of the
increased number of visitors on tours and of the warm responses
to the tours that a second docent class of ten received training to
expand the effort. Another free leaflet on one aspect of the mu-
seum’s collection—the Peacock Room and the Princess from the
Land of Porcelain—was made available to visitors.

Among the visitors to the museum this year were the Humani-

1984. (Bequest of Mrs. Henry E. Coe)
ties Education Study Team from the People’s Republic of China, a
delegation from the Shanghai Museum, and the retiring Secretary-
General of NATO.

Professor Tadashi Kobayashi, of Gakushuin University, Tokyo,
was the fourth Harold P. Stern Memorial Fund Fellow. He spent
the summer studying the Freer’s collection of Japanese genre paint-
ings and Ukiyo-e paintings; a series of catalogues on this collec-
tion was planned.

A group of twenty-nine ancient Chinese ceramic objects, includ-
ing three pieces from the Shang dynasty (ca. 1523-1028 B.C.) that
have survived more than 3,000 years in perfect condition, was
acquired through gift and purchase. The vessels fill out the Freer’s
collection of Chinese ceramics so that it now includes the full
range of ceramic wares from the pre-Christian era. The rarest
object is a burnished, wheel-turned footed jar of black clay made
in Honan Province during the Shang dynasty; it was given in
memory of Helen Dalling Ling, who gathered the collection
together.

Other major donations include an eighteenth-century Mughal
Indian dagger by Dr. Stephen R. Turner and selected library ref-
erence works by the Ellen Bayard Weedon Foundation. Donations
from the Mary Livingston Griggs and Mary Griggs Burke Founda-
tion and from the Clark Endowment Fund enabled the Freer Gal-
lery to acquire important objects for the Japanese collections.

Subtle but substantial changes took place at the doors to the
Freer this year. New wooden doors with Honduran mahogany
and thermal glass in a design echoing the bronze courtyard doors
now greet visitors at the north entrance. Visitors are also now
able to enter the building through the south entrance on a regu-
lar basis.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum

This year the Cooper-Hewitt continued to broaden its appeal to
the public with innovative exhibitions and programs that typify
the diversity of its interests. The museum has received numerous
awards for its exhibitions, publications, and programs, but the
award from the American Institute of Architects is among the

most meaningful. The citation applauds the Cooper-Hewitt’s “com-
mitment to public awareness of the importance of design that is

History and Art / 191
exemplified by the quality of its collections, its far-reaching educa-
tional programs, and its willingness to explore the boundaries of
modern thought while serving as an unmatched repository of his-
torical materials and perspectives,” and concludes that ‘“no museum
has done more to bring to the public’s consciousness the role of
architecture in the life of the nation.”

EXHIBITIONS

One of the more celebrated exhibitions in the past year was Art of
the European Goldsmith, which began its national tour at the
Cooper-Hewitt. Lent by the world-famed Schroder Collection in
England, the exhibition concentrated on European masterworks in
silver and gold from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century.
The exhibition entitled The Amsterdam School: Dutch Expression-
ist Architecture 1915-1930 was the first analysis of this important
topic prepared for English-speaking audiences. Because of its first-
time showing in this country, the Amsterdam School attracted
wide attention among the architectural profession as well as the
public, and served as an important documentation of this style
and period.

The major architectural exhibition of the summer was Manhat-
tan Skyline: Skyscrapers Between the Wars. The period between
World War I and World War II was witness to a building boom
in which the skyscraper played a dominant role, especially in New
York. This exhibition examined many factors that contributed to
the appeal of New York’s soaring structures. Four other larger
exhibitions mounted in 1984 demonstrated the museum’s ability
to explore less conventional areas of design. American Enterprise:
Nineteenth-Century Patent Models was a large selection of color-
ful and unusual examples of patent models embodying both the
history of American patent law and Yankee ingenuity. The mu-
seum staff was responsible for organizing this exhibition, which
included over three-hundred and fifty models. Embroidered Sam-
plers was a display of the finest embroidered samplers from the
Cooper-Hewitt’s own massive collection. Design in the Service of
Tea, the major fall exhibition, included major international loans.
A large survey of tea-related objects from ancient countries to con-
temporary Western forms was provocatively explored in a refresh-
ing manner. And Circles of the World: Traditional Arts of the
Plains Indians presented visitors with a rich array of native Ameri-
can design achievements in crafts objects drawn from the incom-
parable collections of the Denver Art Museum.

192 / Smithsonian Year 1984
The smaller exhibitions in the last year included one devoted to
drawings demonstrating the aesthetic theory evolved by the archi-
tectural sculptor John De Cesare, which relates musical and visual
forms; a selection from the museum’s extensive holdings of prints
by the Tiepolo family; a presentation of a recently acquired collec-
tion of European Damask textiles; an exhibition devoted to intri-
cately carved Netsuke figures from Japan; and, from the Minnea-
polis Institute of Arts’ Doneghy Collection, an exhibition entitled
Finished in Beauty, which presented utilitarian and ornamental
silverwork by Indians of the American Southwest.

Every exhibition within the past year attracted local, national,
and international press comments. New York Magazine described
The Amsterdam School as an “eye opening look at the work of a
lyrically creative group of architects, who for a while virtually
dominated public building in Holland.” The New York Times said
about Manhattan Skyline: ““a handsome exhibition . . . which
reviews the skyscrapers of the 1920’s and 1930’s with thorough-
ness, accuracy and visual delight.”

PUBLICATIONS

A major catalogue for the Amsterdam School was copublished
by Cooper-Hewitt and MIT Press. With the aid of a generous
grant from the New York law firm of Simpson, Thacher and
Bartlett, an important and award-winning publication accompany-
ing the Patent Model exhibition was produced by the museum and
continues to be a popular seller. A Stitch Guide and a collection
handbook on Samplers were published to accompany the exhibi-
tion, illustrating specimens from various European, American, and
other cultures. Another volume in the Cooper-Hewitt’s Smith-
sonian Illustrated Library of Antiques was completed on the
subject of Miniatures, and distribution of the series continues
through the Book-of-the-Month Club.

In keeping with the breadth of such wide-ranging interests, the
museum also published The Phenomenon of Change. Edited by
Lisa Taylor, director, Change includes sixty-five essays by dis-
tinguished scholars, politicians, architects, scientists, philosophers,
and religious leaders. A less expensive tabloid format (popular
with university students) and a soft-cover book were simultane-
ously published. The book is available to bookstores through
Rizzoli International.

PROGRAMS

May 1984 brought the first graduation of a class in the master’s
degree program on European decorative arts, a joint undertaking
of the Cooper-Hewitt and Parsons School of Design. Sir Francis
Watson, British scholar and a former director of London’s Wallace
Collection, spoke in a ceremony held at the museum. Sir Francis,
as a 1983-1984 Regents’ Fellow, was himself credited by director
Lisa Taylor as having been an invaluable source of inspiration to
the students and staff alike. George Nelson, one of America’s
preeminent industrial designers, was also named a Regents’ Fel-
low in 1984 and spoke at a special lecture series on the phenom-
enon of a synthetic planet.

An international group of scholars arrived at the museum for
two symposiums. One, organized by the Decorative Arts Depart-
ment, concentrated its discussions and lectures on virtuoso metal-
work in conjunction with the Schroder Collection exhibition. The
other assembled experts in the field of textiles to discuss the Euro-
pean and American samplers that were on view at the museum
at that time.

The range of programs at the Cooper-Hewitt is so broad as to
include study of life in space to the examination of Chinese pavil-
ions and their decorative arts. Many individuals—members and
nonmembers alike—register for courses at the museum every
quarter, drawn by lectures dealing with temporary exhibitions, the
history of landscape, industrial and interior design, architectural
criticism and history, and a variety of workshops and tours.

The internship program at the museum successfully continued
this year with twelve undergraduate and graduate students assist-
ing in all curatorial and administrative departments. Four of this
year’s interns were selected as Sidney and Celia Siegel Fellows.
With additional grants from the New York State Council on the
Arts, the museum continued to serve as a conservation advisory
center for smaller institutions throughout the state, and was able
to offer a paid internship in textile conservation. The Ford Founda-
tion generally sponsored the fellowship of a doctoral candidate
who researched, organized, and was responsible for the widely
acclaimed Manhattan Skyline exhibition.

COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT

The active pace of Cooper-Hewitt’s exhibition schedule required a
substantial number of loans borrowed from private lenders and

194 / Smithsonian Year 1984
domestic and international museums. Because of the museum’s lack
of space to exhibit its permanent collections, and because of the
quantity of objects it holds, loans to other museums continued at
an increasing rate. The first phase of a continuous inventory was
completed on schedule. Each of the three major departments now
possesses its own inventory technician to build more complete
location guides and new records for objects added to the collec-
tions in future years.

Additional grants from the New York State Council on the Arts
aided with exhibition costs for the Amsterdam exhibition and pro-
duction costs for the Cooper-Hewitt Stitch Guide and The Pheno-
menon of Change, and allowed the museum to have for the first
time its own in-house photographer. The latter position has been
most helpful in documenting new objects entering the collection
and replacing faded photographs and slides. In an important initia-
tive, members of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum Council and the
Board of Regents continued preparations in fiscal year 1984 for a
capital campaign that will provide the museum with important
improvements to its present facility in the near future.

More than 500 objects were accessioned by the museum in fiscal
year 1984. All of the major departments received substantial addi-
tions to their collections. The decorative arts department acces-
sioned the initial part of a gift from Marcia and William Goodman
consisting of important pieces of American art pottery. The tex-
tiles department purchased a set of linen damask napkins with
the Alice Beer Memorial Fund, and owing to the generosity of the
artists and manufacturers, most of the fabrics in the Contemporary
Continuous Pattern exhibition have been added to the collection.
An exceptional illustrated book by Humphrey Repton on the
Brighton Pavilion, published in 1808, was added to the prints and
drawings department as a gift from Mrs. Christian Aall.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Hse), one of the
most important museums of contemporary art in this country,
maintains an active exhibition schedule and acquisitions program.
In support of these are related programs of lectures, films, con-
certs, and educational activities involving audiences of all ages.
