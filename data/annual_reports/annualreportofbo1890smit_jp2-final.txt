JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF

NEw HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, December 31, 1889.

I regret that I find it advisable, from considerations of health and
prudence, to resign the position which I have held for so many years
as a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.
With the best wishes for the prosperity of the Institution and the as-
surance of the highest personal regard for the members of the Board,
Ian,

Very truly yours,

X11 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Dr. Welling, in presenting the report of the Executive Committee for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, called the attention of the Board
to the statement on page 5, under the head of International Exchanges
(which sets forth that an amount has been expended in this department
beyond the annual appropriation made by Congress, entailing annual
loss upon the fund of the Smithsonian Institution) and to the recom-
mendation that Congress be requested to make appropriations to reim-
burse the Smithsonian fund.

On motion it was—

Resolved, That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced
from the Smithsonian fund for governmental service in carrying on the
exchanges.

The report of the committee was then approved.

On motion of Dr. Welling it was also—

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1891, be appropriated for the service of the Institution,
to be expended by the Secretary, with the advice of the Executive Com-
mittee, upon the basis of the operations described in the last annual
report of said committee, with full discretion on the part of the Secre-
tary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of the heads
embraced in the established conduct of the Institution.

The Secretary, in presenting his report for the year ending June 30,
1559, referred especially to the fact that the Smithsonian Institution is
now, and has been for some time, paying out an increasingly large por-
tion of its annual income in service that inures either directly or
indirectly to the benefit of the Government, rather than to its legiti-
mate application for the immediate ‘‘increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge;” and in this connection quoted the opinion of Professor Henry,
expressed as long since as 1872, that the Government should then have
paid the Institution $300,000 for the use of the present building alone.

He did not ask for any immediate action, but invited the attention
of the Regents to this condition of the relation of the Institution’s
affairs to those of the Government, a general condition of which the
loss of the rentof the building might be taken as a single example.

The late Secretary had intended to provide an astro-physical observ-
atory on a modest scale, the building for which would probably cost
uot over ten or fifteen thousand dollars, and with the expectation that
if this amount were contributed by private citizens and the building
placed on Government land, Congress would make an appropriation
for purchasing the apparatus, and also a small annual appropriation
necessary for maintenance. This amount having been pledged by re-
sponsible parties, the Secretary had ordered some of the principal pieces
of apparatus which would take a long time to construct. A number of
valuable pieces had also been loaned to the Institution, and to supply
provisional needs, a cover for all these in the form of a small temporary
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIii

erection has been put up south of this building. This will enable the
apparatus to be used, but it is not the “ observatory ” in question, which,
if Congress makes the necessary appropriation, will probably be erected
at some future time in some suburban site under the Regents’ control.

In this connection he presented a copy of the will of the late Dr.
Jerome H. Kidder, and letters from his executor, accompanied by a
copy of an unsigned codicil. The Secretary stated that Dr. Kidder was
a former officer of the U.S. Navy, who several years ago made a be-
quest of $10,000 to the Smithsonian Institution to be employed for
certain biological purposes. Dr. Kidder afterwards informed the See-
retary that owing to changes in his domestic circumstances, he had
reduced the amount to $5,000 and changed the purpose of the bequest,
which he was desirous to see applied to the astro-physical observatory
in question. It appears however that though this was well known
to Dr. Kidder’s family and friends to be his deliberate purpose, he did
not actually execute this provision to his will, but having ordered a
codicil to that effeet to be drawn, was stricken with so sudden an ill-
ness that he was unable to sign it. (The Secretary read two letters
from the executor stating, in substance, that the family would cheer-
fully pay the $10,000, but that it earnestly desired to see this sum
applied to the astro-physical observatory, in whieh Dr. Kidder’s whole
interest was lately engaged.)

After the clauses of the will and the codicil had been read a discus-
sion followed, from which it appeared to be the opinion of the Board
that if the Regents accepted, in accordance with the wishes of the
_ family and the executors, the deliberate purpose of the testator in re-
gard to the object of the bequest, they should be guided by this pur-
pose also in regard to the amount which they sheuld receive.

Mr. Morrill then offered the following preamble and resolution, which
was adopted :

Whereas the late Jerome H. Kidder having, in a will drawn up
some years before his death, bequeathed the sum of $10,000 to the
Smithsonian Institution for purposes connected with the advancement
of science, did in a codicil to said will, drawn under his direction during
his last hours, but which his sudden death prevented him from execu-
ting, reduce the amount of his bequest to $5,000, which he desired
should be applied toward the establishment of an astro-physical obser-
vatory: It is

Resolved, That the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents
be authorized to accept, as finally and decisively indicative of the wishes
of the testator the provisions of the codicil bequeathing $5,000 for the
_ purpose of an astro-physical observatory, and that they be authorized
to decline to accept from his executors more than this sum; provided,
however, that before doing so they can receive sufficient assurance that
the Institution will be protected against any liability.

The Secretary exhibited recently prepared sketch plans for a new
Museum building, and called the attention of the Regents to their ree-

ommendation to Congress, in January, 1883, of the need of enlarge-
ment.
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Since this resolution, the collections of the Museum have enormously
increased, so that before a new building could now be completed the
material pressing for display would more than cover the entire area of
such a building as the present one. It seems absolutely necessary that
the new building should contain, beside a basement, at least two stories,
it being indispensable to have, apart from the purposes of display,
upper rooms for the preparation of the exhibits below.

The price of material has risen very greatly, so that, owing to these
combined causes, the estimate of 1883 is not applicable to the wants of
to-day. The Secretary did not conceive that any supplementary action
on the part of the Regents was now needed, but submitted these plans
and estimates that they might be advised of the probable very consider-
able increase in the sum that it would now be necessary to ask of Con-
gress,

The Chi_. custiee, being obliged to leave here, resigned the chair to
Senator Morrill.

The Secretary stated that in convection with this subject of the plans
he would present a letter from Mr. Cluss, of the firm of Cluss &
Schulze, architects, asking for “an equitable compensation” for pro-
fessional services and expenses in former years, in connection with a
proposed building for the Museum.

On motion of General Meigs, it was

Resolved, That Messrs. Cluss & Schulze be informed that the ques-
tion of compensation to them for plans for a new Museum building
will be considered when they shall present such a bill as can be sub-
mitted for Congressional action.

The Seeretary recalled to the attention of the Regents a statement
made at their last meeting, to the fact that bills had been brought be-
fore Congress making an appropriation for the purpose of establishing
a Zoological Park under a Board of Commissioners, of whom the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution was one, and directing this Com-
mission, after purchasing and laying out the land and erecting the
necessary buildings, to turn it over to the Regents. The bill as since
actually passed, however, only instructed the Commissioners to pur-
chase the land; and, while declaring the Park to be for the advance-
ment of science, gave no intimation of the intent of Congress about its
ultimate disposal. This Commission has nearly completed the purchase,
and the time has now arrived when the Park may advantageously be
placed under scientific direction. He could” not, of course, anticipate
what the final action of Congress would be in the matter, but he was
authorized to state that the Commission would feel satisfied if Congress
should place the Park under the Regents’ control. There is an increas-
ing collection of animals already in the Regents’ care, and an appropria-

tion of $50,000 has been asked for, to provide for its establishment in

the newly acquired Park, which, within its large area, would also pro-

vide suitable retirement for the small physical observatory already ©

alluded to. He expressed the hope that a bill providing for both meas-
ures would have the support of the Regents in the Senate and in the
House.

After listening to statements by the Secretary relative to the esti-
mates for the ensuing year, and also to the subject of the desirability
of obtaining legislation relative to a statue of Professor Baird, the Re-
gents cousidered the subject of a more convenient time for their annual
meeting in January; and on motion of Senator Cullom it was—

Resolved, That hereafter the time of the annual meeting of the Board
of Regents shall be on the fourth Wednesday in January of each year.

Mr. Wheeler called the attention of the Board to the death of their
late colleague, the Hon. 8S. 8. Cox, and on his motion it was—

Resolved, That a committee be appointed, of which the Secretary
shall be chairman, which shall be authorized to prey: :> resolutions on
the services and character of the late S. S. Cox, and to make the same

of record.

The chairman announced as the committee, the Secretary, General
Wheeler, Dr. Welling, Mr. Lodge.

The committee submitted the following report and resolutions, which
were unanimously adopted :

To the Board of Regents:

Your committee report that the Hon. 8. 8. Cox was first appointed a
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1861, and that he
filled that office, except for intervals caused by public duties, to the
time of his death.

While he was a regular attendant at all the meetings of the Board,
he was ever ready to advance the interests of the Institution and of
science, either as a Regent or aS amember of Congress; and although
such men as Hamlin, Fessenden, Colfax, Chase, Garfield, Sherman,
Gray, and Waite, in a list comprising Presidents, Vice-Presidents,
Chief Justices, and Senators of the United States were his associates,
there were none whose service was longer or more gratefully to be re-
membered, nor perhaps any to whom the Institution owes more than to
Mr. Cox.

The regard in which his brother Regents held Mr. Cox’s accuracy of
characterization, and his instinctive recognition of all that is worthiest
of honor in other men, may be inferred from the eulogies which he was
requested by them to deliver, among which may be particularly men-
tioned the one at the commemoration in honor of Professor Henry in the
House of Representatives; but though these only illustrate a very small
part of his services as a Regent, your committee are led by their con-
sideration to recall that his first act upon your Board was the prepara-
tion and delivery of an address, at the request of the Regents, on their
late colleague, Stephen A. Douglas, and that on this occasion he used
words which your committee permit themselves to adopt, as being in
their view singularly characteristic of Mr. Cox himself:

‘It was not merely as one of its Regents that he showed himself the
true and enlightened friend of objects kindred to those of this estab-
lishment. He ever advocated measures which served to advance
knowledge and promote the progress of hamanity. The encourage-
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

ment of the fine arts, the rewarding of discoverers and inventors, the
organization of exploring expeditions, as well as the general diffusion
of education were all objects of his special regard.”

In view of these facts it is—

Resolved, That in the death of: Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox the Smith-
sonian Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of a long-tried friend,
the Board of Regents of a most valued associate and active member
during tifteen years of service, and the country of one of its most dis-
tinguished citizens.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to express their deep
sympathy with the bereaved family of the deceased, and direct that
a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of their late
associate.

On motion of Senator Cullom, the Board adjourned sine die.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1890, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, or, in his
absence, of the Assistant Secretary as acting Secretary, and a certificate
that the materials and services charged were applied to the purposes
of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the ‘ Interna-
tional Exchanges,” and of the “ National Museum,” and of the ‘ National
Zoological Park,” and finds that the balances above given correspond
with the certificates of the disbursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, whose appointment as such disbursing officer was accepted and
his bonds approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

ation for * North American Ethnology” have been exhibited to us; the

ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS RELATIVE TO THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, NATIONAL MUSEUM, ETC,

(In continuation from previous reports. )

[ Fifty-first Congress, first session, 1889-90. ]

Cuap. 156.—AN ACT to provide for celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of
the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus by holding an international
exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and the product of the soil, mine,
and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of Illinois.

Whereas, It is fit and appropriate that the four hundredth anni-
versary of the discovery of America be commemorated by an_ exhibi-
tion of the resources of the United States of America, their develop-
ment, and of the progress of civilization of the New World; and

Whereas, Such an exhibition should be of a national and interna-
tional character, so that not only the people of our Union and this con-
tinent, but those of all nations as well, can participate, and should
therefore have the sanction of the Congress of the United States;
Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That an exhibition of arts,

REPORT OF 8. P. LANGLEY,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1890.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: [| have the honor to submit herewith the report for the
year ending June 30, 1890, of the operations of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and of the work placed by Congress under its charge in the Na-
tional Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the International Exchanges,
and the National Zoological Park.

The National Zoological Park has been formally placed under the
care of the Board of Regents during this year,* although its establish-
ment has been under consideration for some time and the preliminary
steps connected therewith have been referred to in previous reports.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
VYHE ESTABLISHMENT.

By the organizing act of Congress of August 10, 1846, sec. 1, it was
provided that ‘The President, and Vice-President of the United States,
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of
War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, the Attorney-
General, the Chief-Justice, and the Commissioner of the Patent Office
of the United States, and the Mayor of the city of Washington, during
the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, and such other
persons as they may elect honorary members, be, and they are hereby
constituted an ‘establishment’ by the name of the ‘Smithsonian Insti-
tution,’” etc. In the Revised Statutes “the Governor of the District
of Columbia” was substituted for the Mayor of the city of Washing-
ton, the latter office having become extinct.

Two members having been added to the cabinet of the President
since the passage of the act, namely, the Secretary of the Interior, and
_ more recently the Secretary of Agriculture, there appears no good rea-
son why these should not be included in the list of officers of the estab-
lishment. This would obviously be consonant with the original inten-
tion of the framers of the act, though excluded by the phraseology
actually employed. It may be worthy of consideration of the Board of
Regents whether it would not be for the interests of the Institution to
ask of Congress a re-construction of the section referred to, whereby

*Act of Congress approved April 30, 1890.

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the President, Vice-President, Secretaries of the several Executive
Departments, and the Chief-Justice of the United States shall consti-
tute the Establishment.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS,

The stated annual meeting of the Board was held on January 8, 1890,
at which the resignation of Dr. Noah Porter, presented on account of
failing health, was accepted in the following resolution:

Resolved, That the Board having received the resignation of Dr. Noah
Porter as a Regent accept it with an expression of their regret, and
with assurances of their high personal esteem.

At the same meeting, the appointment by the honorable the Speaker
of the House of Representatives on January 6, 1890, of the following
members of the House as Regents was announced: the Hon. Benjamin
Butterworth, of Ohio, the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts,
the Hon. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama.

The death of the Hon. Samuel S. Cox, for many years a Regent of
the Institution, and its earnest friend and supporter, was referred to in
my last annual report. By a resolution of the Board of Regents a com-
mittee was appointed, of which the Secretary was made chairman, to
prepare suitable resolutions on his services and character, and these
formal resolutions, with a brief biographical sketch, are given in full in
the “ necroiogy ” appended.

The institution is indebted to Mrs. Cox for a portrait of her husband,
to be placed with the collection of portraits of past Regents.

By joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President May 22,
1890, Dr. James C. Welling, whose term as a Regent had expired, was
re-elected; and by the same resolution Judge Charles Devens, of Mas-
sachusetts, was appointed a member of the Board to succeed Dr. Porter.

I regret to say that Judge Devens has written to me to state that
there is a provision in the constitution of Massachusetts in reference to
judges of its supreme court, which it has been suggested would prevent
any one of them from holding such a position. No action had been taken
in the matter at the time of this report.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the institution remain as at the time of my
last report, namely :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

It seems to me desirable in this connection to direct attention to the
exceptional advantages offered in the organization of the Smithsonian
Institution for the administration of funds intended for the advance-
ment of science and the increase of knowledge throughout the world.
The governing board of the Institution is composed of the highest offi-
cers Of the United States Government, associated with some of the most
distinguished men of learning in the country. The United States Gov-
ernment is itself pledged to the security of the funds of the Institution,
guaranteeing an interest of six per cent. annually.

It is safe to say that no institution of learning is better known
throughout the world, and I am impressed with the belief that were it
also more widely known that the United States, in accepting the gift of
Smithson, has signified a willingness to become thecustodian of further
bequests for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, its permanent
endowment would be constantly increased.

The principal facts in relation to Smithson’s bequest have been stated
in brief in my previous reports and elsewhere at considerable length,
and need not be repeated here.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the balance on hand of the in-
come was $11,757.47. Interest on the invested fund, amounting to
$42,180, has been received from the Treasurer of the United States,
$5,000 have been received from the estate of the late Dr. Jerome H.
Kidder, and a like amount from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell for the
prosecution of special researches in physics, to which allusion is else-
where made, and $3,905.51 have been received from miscellaneous
sources, making the total receipts $67,842.98.

The total expenditures have been $37,650.33, leaving an unexpended
balance on June 30, 1890, of $30,192.65, or, deducting the donations for
special researches noted above, amounting to $10,000, the balance
available for general expenses on July 1, 1890, was $20,192.65. This
sum, which is somewhat larger than usual, is in part held against cer-
tain anticipated grants in aid of scientific investigation and the cost of
their publication by the Institution.

The Institution has been charged by Congress with the disbursement
during the year of the following special appropriations:

The vouchers for the disbursement of these appropriations, with the
exception of those for “ethnological researches,” have been examined
by the Executive Committee, and the various items of expenditure, in-
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cluding those of the Bureau of Ethnology, are set forth in a letter ad-
dressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives in accordance
with a provision of the sundry civil act of October 2, 1888, while the
expenditures from the Smithsonian fund, having likewise been examined
and approved by the executive committee, are given in their report.
The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1891, forwarded to
the Secretary of the Treasury under date of October 1, 1889, were as

follows:

BUILDINGS.

I regret that Iam unable to report any immediate prospect of relief
from the over-crowded condition of the Museum building. The Re-
gents nearly eight years ago, (at their meeting of January 17, 1883,)
recommended to Congress the erection of a new Museum building, and
the previous steps taken in pursuance of their instruction have already
been laid before the Board. Since 1883, the collections of the Museum
have enormously increased, so that before a new building can now be
completed, the material pressing for display or even for storage, will
demand a considerable part of a building as large as the present one.

Sketeh-plans for a building that would meet the wants of the Museum
for the immediate future were laid before the Board at their meeting in
January, 1890. These plans contemplated a building of two stories and
a basement, it being indispensable to have rooms for the preparation and
study of material apart from the rooms used purely for the purposes of
exhibition.

A bill appropriating $500,000 for a building was reported by Sen-
ator Morrill on February 19, 1890, from the Senate Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, and passed the Senate on the 5th of
April, 1890. It was referred in the House to its Committee on Public

snildings and Grounds, from which it has not as yet been reported.
The following letter in relation to the subject transmitted to the Hon.
Leland Stanford, chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Build-

ings and Grounds, sets forth at some length the urgent need for fur-

[Senate Mis. Doc. No. 116, Fifty-first Congress, first session. ]

LETTER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN RELATION TO A
BUILDING FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM,
Washington, January 21, 1890.

Sir: I send you herewith a set of sketch-plans intended to show, in
a general way, the extent and character of a building such as would
seem to be necessary for the accommodation of the Museum collections
in the present and immediate future, and respectfully request for them
your attention, and a recommendation to Congress of the necessary
means for such a building.

These plans and sketches are provisional, but although not presented
in detail, they represent the results of studies, extending over many
years, of the plans of the best modern museum buildings in Kurope and
America, nearly all of which have been inspected by officers of the
Smithsonian Institution.

The proposed building covers the same area as that finished in 1881.
It is intended to consist of two stories and a basement, except in the
central portion, which consists of one lofty hall open from the main floor
to the roof, the height of which will be 90 feet, galleries being placed
on the level of the second floor in other. parts of the building. Itsinte-
rior arrangements are, as you will see, different from those in the actual
Museum, all the changes having been planned in the light of the expe-
rience of nine years’ occupation of the present building. It will afford
between two and three times as much available space for exhibition
and storage under the same area of roof. The fifteen exhibition halls
are completely isolated from each other, and may readily besubdivided,
when necessary, into smaller rooms. The lighting will be as good as
in the old building, and the ventilation perhaps still better. The sani-
tary arrangements have been carefully considered.

The necessity for a basement is especially great. In this, place has
been provided for many storage rooms and workshops. The existence
of a basement will promote the comfort and health of visitors and em-
ployés, and by increasing the dryness of the air in the exhibition halls,
will secure the better preservation of the collections. These proposed
changes in the internal arrangements will not interfere with conformity
with the other points of the present Museum building in the essential
features of exterior proportion. The total capacity of this present
building in available floor space is about 100,000 square feet; that of
the new building somewhat exceeds 200,000. The present Museum
building contains about 80,000 feet of floor space available for exhibi-
tion. That proposed will contain about 103,300 square feet for exhibi-
tion. The space devoted to offices and laboratories would not be much
more, but the area available for exhibition halls, storage rooms, and
workshops far greater. The appropriation for the construction of the
present building was $250,000. This sum was supplemented by several
special appropriations: $25,000 for steam-heating apparatus ; $26,000
for marble floors; $12,500 for water and gas fixtures and electrical
apparatus, and $1,900 for special sewer connections, so that the total
cost was $315,400. The structure was probably completed for asmaller
sum of money than any other similar one of equal capacity in the world,
at an expense ralative to capacity which the present prices of material
make it certain cau not be repeated.

The estimates of cost on this building vary greatly with regard to
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

details of construction on which I do not here enter, further than to
say that the whole should be absolutely fire-proof throughout, and in
view of the further great variation of the cost of building materials
within the past two years, I am not prepared to state the sum which
would be necessary for its completion. It is certain, however, that
$500,000, if not sufficient to complete it, would be all that would be
required to be expended during the present year, and I would respect-
fully represent the desirability of an appropriation of this amount for the
purpose in question.

Your attention is directed to certain facts in regard to the character
of the materials for the accommodation of which this building is desired.
The collections of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Government
are especially rich in collections of natural history, which may be
grouped in three general classes: The zoological collections; the botan-
ical collections, and the geological collections. including not only all
the geological and mineralogical material, but the greater portion of
that belonging to paleontology, the study of fossil animals and plants
forming an essential part of modern geological work.

3esides the natural history collections, there are equally important
anthropological collections which illustrate the history of mankind at
all periods and in every land, and which serve to explain the develop-
ment of all human arts and industries. In everything that relates to
the primitive inhabitants of North America, Eskimo as well as Indian,
these collections are by far the richest in the world, and with the nee-
essary amount of exhibition space, the material on hand will be arranged
in a manner which will produce the most impressive and magnificent
effect, the educational importance of which can not be over-estimated.
Again, there are collections of considerable extent which illustrate the
processes and products of the various arts and industries, as well as
what are termed the historical collections, which are of especial interest
to a very large number of the visitors of the Museum on account of the
associations of the objects exhibited with the personal history of repre-
sentative men, or with important events in the history of America.

The collections illustrating the arts and the art industries are rela-
tivelysmall, and although in themselves of great interest and value, not
to be compared in importance with those in natural history and eth-
nology.

In a letter addressed on June 7, 1888, to the Hon. Justin S. Morrill,
and which will be found in a report of June 12 of the same year from
the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, I made a state-
ment of the rapidity of the recent growth of the Museum, mentioning
that in the five years from 1882 to 1887 the number of specimens in the
collection had multiplied no less than sixteen times, and endeavored to
give an idea, though, perhaps, an inadequate one, of the extent to which
the pressure for want of space was felt. The evil has grown rapidly
worse, and as I have had occasion to mention, it has been felt in the last
year in @ partial arrest of the growth of the collections, which empha-
sizes the demand for more room. The present Museum building is not
la: ge enough even for the natural history collections alone, a number of
Which are without any exhibition space whatever. The proposed build-
ing will afford accommodations for the ethnological and technological
material already on hand, and for a large part of the natural history
material also.

The collections are still increasing, and the number of specimens, as
estimated, is now not far from 3,000,000. The appended table (A) shows
the annual increase since 1882. The increase during the last year was
- REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7
comparatively small. This may be accounted for by the fact that our
exhibition halls and storage rooms being filled to their utmost capacity,
it has seemed necessary to cease in a large degree the customary eftorts’
for the increase of the Museum.

Unless more space is soon provided, the development of the Govern-
ment collections will of necessity be almost completely arrested.

So long as there was room for storage, collections not immediately re-
quired could be received and packed away for future use. This can not
longer be done.

The Armory Building, since 1877 assigned to the Museum for storage
and workshops, is now entirely occupied by the U.S. Fish Commission,
with the exception of four rooms, and by some of the Museum tax-
idermists, who are now working in very contracted space, and whom it
is impossible to accommodate elsewhere.

Increased space in the exhibition halls is needed, the educational
value of the collections being seriously diminished by the present
crowded system of installation. Still more necessary, however, is room
for storage, for re-arranging the great reserve collections, for eliminating
duplicate material for distribution to college aud school museums, and
for the use of the taxidermists and preparators engaged in preparing
objects for exhibition. Space is also required for the proper handling
of the costly outfit of the Museum cases and appliances for installation,
of which there is always a considerabie amount temporarily out of use
or in process of construction.

The appended table (B) shows the amount of floor space now assigned
to the various collections and the amount required for the proper dis-
play of material already in hand, making a reasonable allowance for
the expansion during the three years which would probably pass before
a new building could be completed and provided with necessary cases.

The appended table (C) shows the number of feet of floor space (the
average height being 10 feet) required for laboratories, workshops,
and for the several departments. This isin addition to storage space
under the cases in the exhibition halls, and a considerable portion may
be in cellars and attics.

In summarizing what has just been said, it may be stated in general
terms that the amount of space already required for exhibition pur-
poses alone, being (table B) 207,500 feet as against 100,675 now occupied,
and this being exclusive of the (table C) 108,900 square feet needed for
other objects, the accumulations have now reached such a point of con-
gestion that the actual space needs to be doubled, even independently
of future increase; and I beg to repeat that, unless more space is pro-
vided, the development of the Government collection, which is already
partly arrested, will be almost completely stopped.

Your obedient servant.

In compliance with the requirements of the sundry civil bill approved
March 2, 1889, an examination was made of the National Museum by
the Architect of the Capitol for the purpose of estimating the cost of
constructing a basement story under that building. The only portion
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of such a basement suitable for workshops and storage would be a cel-
lar running around the outer walls of the building and extending in-
wards 30 feet, so that the rooms thus obtained might have light and
air. Provision was also made to floor with tiles all the rooms under
which these basements come. The total expense it is thought would
be $57,675, but by reason of the peculiar construction of the present
building the Architect has expressed the opinion that the work esti-
mated for would be one of unusual difficulty, and that a site for a store-
house and workshops required might be purchased in the neighborhood
of the Museum and a fire-proof building erected thereon for a less sum.

The improvement of the Smithsonian building proper has been the
subject of careful consideration, more especially the fire-proofing of the
west wing, the urgent need of which has aiready been brought to the
attention of the Regents. A bill was introduced in the Senate on Jan-
uary 15,1890, by Senator Morrill, providing for an appropriation of
$45,000 for fire-proofing the roof of the main hall and that of the so-
called chapel in the west wing of the Smithsonian building, putting in
a sky-light and well hole for lighting the east wing, and making certain
changes which would add greatly to the space available for office rooms
in that part of the building, as well as adding to the facility with which
the large amount of exchange publications could be handled. This
work was to be done under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol
with the approval of the Regents. The bill passed the Senate on Feb-
ruary 10, 1890, and was favorably reported on in the House March 3,
1890. The matterrested here at the close of the year.

The temporary wooden building for the protection of instruments for
astro-physical investigation, which was referred to as contemplated in
“my last report, was begun on November 30, 1885, and was completed
about the Ist of March, 1890. This building is of the most inexpensive
character, and is simply intended to protect the instruments tempora-
rily, though it is also arranged so that certain preliminary work can be
done here. Its position however immediately south of the main Smith-
sonian building, is not well suited to refined physical investigations on
account of its proximity to city streets and its lack of seclusion. The
needs of this department are referred to more at length under the fol-
lowing head of research.

RESEARCH.

I take pleasure in reporting that the Institution has been able to do
rather more for the encouragement of original research than it has
done for several years past.

Referring to my two previous reports in regard to the project of
Professor Baird for securing an astro-physical observatory and labora-
tory, lam able to say that this object has assumed definite shape in
the construction of the temporary shed, which has just been mentioned.
In this shed there have been built, as the most expensive part of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. bal

structure, a number of brick piers required for the firm support of the
delicate apparatus emploved.

In connection with the construction of this building, I desire to ex-
press my thanks to Col. O. H. Ernst, U.S. Army, in charge of publie
buildings and grounds, for the supervision rendered by his office of the
work of excavating, etc., for the necessary sewer and water connections.

The principal instrument consists of a siderostat constructed by Sir
Howard Grubb, of Dublin, Ireland, for the Smithsonian Institution, to
meet my special requirements. This arrived in March, 1890, and has been
mounted and put approximately into position for use. Another impor-
tant and novel instrument, a spectro-bolometer, was made under my
directions to meet new and unusual demands, and has also been received
and put in place. A third piece of apparatus, a special galvanometer,
also designed for the particular class of work in view, has been received ;
and the only considerable instrument now required to complete the out-
fit is a resistance box, which has been ordered and is expected from
London before the end of the calendar year.

The siderostat is probably the largest and most powerful instrument
of its kind ever constructed. The spectro-bolometer is the largest in-
strument of its kind, and with this improved apparatus it is hoped that
interesting investigations begun several years ago, will be continued.

Supplementary to these principal instruments is the Thaw collee-
tion of physical apparatus loaned by the executors of the late Will-
iam Thaw, of Pittsburgh, and there are a few pieces of apparatus, the
personal preperty of the Secretary, so that at the close of the year it
might be said that the Institution was in possession of the nucleus of
a modern astrophysical laboratory. With this apparatus temporarily
mounted, researches have already begun, and one of a scientific and
economic character upon “ The Cheapest Form of Light” has been the
subject of a communication to the National Academy of Sciences. This
work is mentioned as indicating my intention to give greater place to
one of the chief objects of the Institution, the direct addition to knowl-
edge by original research,—which, at least as regards the physical
sciences, has received comparatively little attention since the time of
Professor Henry.

The prospects of renewed contributions to physical science by the
Institution in the field of original research are happily now better than
for many years past. The late Dr. Jerome H. Kidder, formerly an offi-
cer of the U. 8. Navy, and later attached to the U.S. Fish Commission
and to the Smithsonian Institution, had bequeathed to the Institution,
in a will made several years ago, the sum of $10,000 to be employed for
biological researches. Dr. Kidder, having become especially interested
in the proposed astro-physical observatory, had the intention of trans-
ferring this bequest, or at least a portion of it, to such an end, and he
even ordered that a codicil giving $5,000 to the Institution for an astro-
physical observatory should be added to his will, but he was stricken
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

with so sudden an illness that he was unable to signit. In view of
these circumstances and after careful deliberation upon the matter, the
Regents decided to accept as finally and decisively indicative of the
wishes of the testator the provisions of this codicil bequeathing $5,000
for the purpose of an astro-physical observatory, and this sum was
therefore paid by Dr. Kidder’s executor to the Institution.

A further sum of $5,000 was likewise generously presented by Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell to the writer individually for the prosecution
of the researches in astro-physies, to which he has devoted much of his
life, but it has seemed proper to him, under the circumstances, that this
sum should be placed to the credit of the Smithsonian Institution upon
the same footing as the Kidder bequest, and with the consent of the
donor it has been so transferred. I am therefore desirous of here ex-
pressing my own personal as well as my official obligation to Dr. Bell
for this gift for the increase of knowledge.

The initial step for the establishment of an astro-physical observa-
tory under the National Government thus having been taken by private
individuals, it is hoped that Congress will see fit to place it upon a firm
footing and to make a small annual provision for its maintenance, And
it seems proper to mention that the field of research to which such a
department of the Institution would be devoted has been considered of
sufficient importance by the legislators of leading foreign nations to
justify the erection of costly special observatories and to provide for
their maintenance with a staff of astronomers and physicists of wide
reputation.

The class of work here specially referred to does not ordinarily in-
volve the use of the telescope, and is quite distinct from that carried
on at any observatory in thiscountry. It would in no way conflict with
the work of the present U. S. Naval Observatory, being in a field of
work that the latter has never entered.

sriefly stated, the work for which the older Government observa-
tories at Greenwich, Paris, Berlin, and Washington were founded, and
in which they are for the most part now engaged, is the determination
of relative positions of heavenly bodies and of our own place with ref-
erence to them. Within the past twenty years, all these Governments
but our own have established astro-physical observatories, as they are
called, that are engaged in the study of the constitution of the heav-
enly bodies as distinguished from their positions; in determining, for
example, not so much the position of the sun in the sky as the rela-
tion that it bears to the earth and to our own daily wants; how it effects
terrestrial climate; and how it may best be studied for the purposes
of the meteorologist, and so on; and it is an observatory of the latter
kind that the donors just mentioned appear to have bad prominently
in view, and which it is proposed to conduct (though on an extremely
modest scale) under the auspices of the Institution.

In connection with this renewed revival in the line of physical re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. is

search, I may state that steps have been taken to give effect to certain
resolutions expressed at a meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science several years ago, in regard to the establish-
ment of standard screw threads and standard diameters of tubing for
astronomical and physical apparatus. The introduction of such stand-
ards in mechanical work of all kinds has proved itself of such great
value that its usefulness need not be dwelt upon. As a preliminary
step looking to the establishment of this desired uniformity on the part
of scientific men, a conference has been had with the Superintendent of
the Coast Survey, and it is proposed to invite the co operation of other
Government bureaus, and to give effect to their conclusions by ordering
and establishing, on behalf of the Institution, recognized standards for
the use of scientific instrument makers in all parts of the world.

I have here referred to researches in physical science alone, the work
of the Institution and of individual members of its staff and others in
natural history being given at some length under the head of the Mu-

seum.
EXPLORATIONS.

The work of exploration by the Institution has been carried on through
the Bureau of Ethnology and the National Museum, and to the Reports
of these departments reference should be made for details.

In my report for last year, mention was made of a trip to Africa by
Mr. Talcott Williams, and of the interesting results that had been se-
cured by him. A valuable collection of specimens that he obtained is
still unpacked and a complete description of them can not be given
until they have been thoroughly examined.

He was fortunate enough to secure five sheets of anextremeiy rare Ber-
ber manuscript, made probably in the thirteenth century ; a botanical
collection of about three hundred plants, of which all except four or five
are phenagamous fossils from a hitherto unexplored region; a valuable
collection of ethnographic material from Morocco; villager costumes
of men and women, representing both the Berber and mountain vil-
lages, and a collection of pottery made with the special design of in-
cluding all the wares in ordinary use between Tetuan and Fez. Arti-
cles illustrating light, fire, and the industry of comb-making and num-
erous household utensils were also secured.

It may safely be asserted that this collection, taken as a whole, is one
of the most interesting of the kind that the Museum has ever received,
and the thanks of the Smithsonian Institution are due Mr. Williams for
the manner in which he has accomplished his mission.

Mr. W. W. Rockhill, whose explorations in Thibet were also referred
to in my last report, has spent a large part of the year in Washington,
engaged in preparing an account of his remarkable travels, and he has
loaned to the Museum, in addition to his large and almost unique col-
lection of Thibetan material, a most valuable lot of cloisonnés, bronzes,
and carved lacquers collected during his residence in Pekin.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

I may also mention here collections of unusual interest and value,
made by Dr, W. A. Abbott, in the region of Mount Kilémanjaro,
avd of those by Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National Museum,
while attached to the United States Eclipse Expedition to the west
coast of Africa, under the auspices of the Navy Department. Grate-
ful acknowledgments are due Dr. W. H. Rusb, U. S. Navy; Mr. J. P.
Iddings, U. S. Geological Survey; Mr. E. M. Aaron, of the American
Jntomological Society; Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of San Diego, Cal., from whom
specimens secured in their travels have been received or are expected.
Mr. Henry W. Elliott, who is now visiting the Seal Islands of Alaska on
United States Government business, is expected to secure for the Mu-
seum specimens of fur-seal, fishes, and other zoological material.

In the Bureau of Ethnology I would refer to the mound explorations
that have been conducted under the immediate superintendence of Prof.
Cyrus Thomas, by Mr. H. L. Reynolds, Mr. J. D. Middleton, and Mr.
James Mooney; and to the general field work, chiefly among the Indian
tribes, of Mr. W.H. Holmes, Dr. W.J. Hotfmnan, Mr. Victor Mindeleff, Mr.
James Mooney, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin, Mr. J. W. B. Hewitt, and Mrs.
T. E. Stevenson.

PUBLICATIONS.

With regard to the character of the works issued by the Institution
during the past year, little is to be added to the general statements made
in my last report. In each of the three classes of Smithsonian publica-
tions, to wit, I, The Contributions to Knowledge; II, The Miscellaneous
Collections ; and III, The Annual Reports, about the same amount of
productiveness has been maintained.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—An original memoir by Prof.
Alpheus Hyatt on the “‘ Genesis of the Arietide,” illustrated with numer-
ous plates, has been published during the year, and this has permitted
the completion of the long-delayed twenty-sixth volume of the quarto
series. Two other memoirs, relating to the solar corona, have been pub-
lished in the same quarto form, but will not probably be included in the
volumes of the “ Contributions.”

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—W hile the number of separate
titles under this class has been considerable, many of them are the
separate issues of articles contributed at the expense of the Institution
to the Annual Reports. It is in contemplation to devote a larger space
in the * Collections” than of late to publications connected with the
physical seiences ; in which direction may be mentioned as one of the
more important issues of the year, an “ Index to the Literature of Ther-
modynamics,” by Mr. Alfred Tuckerman. The demand for copies of the
exhausted fourth edition of Guyot’s Meteorological and Physical Tables,
published in 1884, has been deemed sufficient to warrant the revision of
the work and the issue of a new edition, which has been for several
years under consideration. After obtaining the views of prominent me-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

teorologists the work was placed in the hands of Prof. William Libbey,
jr., of Princeton, New Jersey, with the expectation that the new edi-
tion will be ready for the printer during the coming year.

Among the publications of this series mention may be made of the
tenth “ Toner Lecture,” by Dr. Harrison Allen, on “* A Clinical Study
of the Skull.”

A revised catalogue and index of all the Smithsonian publications to
the middle of 1886, occupying 385 pages, prepared by Mr. William J.
Rhees, the chief clerk, has also been published.

No completed volume of the Miscellaneous Collections has been issued
within the year.

Smithsonian Annual Reports.—The annual report of the Regents to
Congress for the year ending June 30, 1887, in two parts or volumes,
has been received from the Public Printer and has been widely dis-
tributed. The annual report for the succeeding year, 1888, although
printed, has not yet been received ; but is daily expected.

A detailed account of the several publications of the Smithsonian
Institution for the year, under each class, will be given in the Appendix.

Other publications.—The publications of the National Museum com-
' prise the “ Proceedings of the National Museum” and the *“ Bulletins
of the National Museum,” and are maintained by an appropriation an-
nually made by Congress. As stated in my last report, “It has been
decided to hereafter omit these publications from the series” of Miscel-
laneous Collections issued by the Institution.* Of the publications of
the Bureau of Ethnology the sixth annual report has been issued dur-
ing the year.

The edition of Swan’s paper on ‘The Indians of Cape Flattery”
having become exhausted, a new edition of 250 copies has been printed.

The Anuual Report of the American Historical Association, which by
the act of incorporation the Secretary of the Institution is directed to
communicate to Congress, has been printed as Senate Miscellaneous
Document No. 170.

In October, 1859, final arrangements were made with Prof. Edward
D. Cope, whereby it is expected that his important work upon * Rep-
tilia,” undertaken several years ago at the request of the Secretary,
will be ready for the printer by the end of December, 1890.

Except in the case of the Annual Reports, the publications of the In-
stitution are generally issued with satisfactory promptness. The An-
nual Reports, which have been for some years so seriously behindhand
as to materially affect the value of the reviews upon scientific progress,
are, it is hoped, to be brought up to date during the coming year.

To avoid any possible delay on account of lack of legislation, the at-
tention of the chairman of the Committee on Printing of the United
States Senate has been called to the desirability of having the bill pro-

Report of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 18389-’90.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

viding for the printing of the Annual Reports so worded as to allow for
the printing of future reports without special legislation each year, at
the some time increasing the number of copies to 19,000. An act of
Congress in the following terms would probably accomplish all that
is desired :

That there be printed of the Reports of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and of the National Museum, for the years ending June thirty,
eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, and June thirty, eighteen bun-
dred and eighty-nine, and annually thereafter, in two octavo volumes
for each year, nineteen thousand extra copies, of which three thousand
shall be for the use of the Senate, six thousand for the House of Rep-
resentatives, and ten thousand for the Smithsonian Institution.

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
on January 8, 1890, it was—

Resolved, That the Regents instruct the Secretary to ask of Congress
legislation for the repayment to the Institution of the amount advanced
from the Smithsonian fund for Governmental service in carrying on
the exchanges.

In connection with this resolution the following outline of the history
of the exchanges is important :

Under the act of Congress accepting a donation from James Smith-
son ‘for the increase and diffusion of knowedge among men,” and

‘

giving effect to this trust by the foundation of the Smithsonian Insti- —

tution, the Board of Regents in 1851 established a system of interna-
tional exchanges of the transactions of learned societies and like works ;
but, in addition to such publications, it voluntarily transported between
1851 and 1867 somewhat over 20,000 packages of publications of the
bureaus of the National Government at an estimated cost to the pri-
vate funds of. the Institution of about $8,000. This, however, was
understood to be a voluntary service, and no request for its re imburse_
ment has been made or is contemplated.

Congress, however, in 1867, by its act of March 2, imposed upon the
Institution the duty of exchanging fifty copies of alldocuments printed
by order of either House of Congress, or by the United States Govern-
ment bureaus, for similar works published in foreign countries, and
especially by foreign Governments.

The Institution possessed special facilities and experience for such
work, the propriety of its undertaking which, in the interests of the
Government, is evident; but it was hardly to have been anticipated
that the Government should direct this purely administrative service
aud make no appropriation for its support. Such, however, was the
case, and with the exception of a small (presently to be noted) sum,
returned by some bureaus, it was almost entirely maintained during
the next thirteen years, or until the first appropriation to the Institu-

tion for exchanges in 1881, at the expense of the private fund of James
Smithson.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

From January 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, 292,483 packages contain-
ing these official Government publications, having little to do with
the object to which Congress devoted the Institution’s private funds
were transported by the Exchange Bureau at a pro rata cost of
$92,943.36 of which $29,706.85 accrued between 1881, when the first
specific appropriation was made, and 1886. Of this $92,943.36 $19,302.35
was returned from various Departments and bureaus, leaving a balance
of $73,641.01 expended in carrying exclusively Governmental publica-
tions.

What has preceded refers to the transportation of official documents,
and not to that of transactions of learnéd societies and other like works;
but it is now necessary to mention that in 1878 the honorable the Sec-
retary of State designated the Smithsonian Institution as the special
agent for the United States Government for carrying out the provisions
of an international convention at Paris, which made the respective
Governments assume the cost, not only of the transportation of official
documents, but of scientific and literary publications, between the
states interested, and it would seem that Congress itself adopted this
view of its responsibility, for from July 1, 1881, to June 30, 1886, while
the Congressional and bureaucratic exchange represented a pro rata cost
of $29,706.85 and the scientific publications $39,034.90, Congress ap-
propriated directly $35,500, somewhat more than the cost of the Govern-
ment exchange, but leaving a balance of $3,534.90 for scientific and
literary exchanges unpaid. This latter sum, $3,534.90, added to the

73,641.01 mentioned above, makes a total of $77,175.91, for which, iu
equity, repayment might be requested.

In 1886, on the 15th of March, plenipotentiaries of the United States
and various other nationalities signed a convention more formal than
that at Paris, by which the respective Governments definitely assumed
the exchange of official documents and scientific and literary publica-
tions between the states interested.

Adopting, then, the year 1886, rather than the earlier date, 1881
(though, as mentioned in the report, equity would seem to allow the
Institution the entire sum expended in exchanges, at least since its
official recognition by Congress in 1881 as the Government exchange
agent), it appears upon deducting the amount appropriated by Con-
gress, $35,500, from the balance shown ip the preceding paragraph,
$73,641.01, that we have $38,141.01 as the amount due the private fund
of James Smithson from 1868 to 1886.

Considering separately the period from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889,
we find that theamount expended in these years under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution on account of international exchanges was
$47,126.56; of this sum $37,000° was paid by Congressional appropria-
tions, $3,091.75 were paid by Government departments and others, and
the balance, $7,034.81, by the Smithsonian Institution.

To recapitulate briefly it appears, then, that the following sums lave

‘H. Mis, 129———2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been expended from the Smithsonian funds for the support of the inter-
national exchange system in the interests and by the authority of the
Natioual Government, namely, $38,141.01 in excess of appropriations
advanced from Jauuary 1, 1868, to June 30, 1886, for the exchange of
official Government documents, and $7,034.81 in excess of appropriations
from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1889, advanced for the purpose of carry-
ing out a convention entered into by the United States, or an aggregate
of $45,175.82.

A memorandum setting forth the above facts and requesting that
steps be taken to procure the return to the Smithsonian fund by Con-
gress of the sum last mentioned ($45,175.82) was transmitted on the
20th of May, 1890, to the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth, of the Board of
Regents, to be laid by the latter before Congress in due form.

The exchange work has shown the usual increase, no less than 82,572
packages having been handled during the year, or 6,606 more than
during the year immediately preceding. The number of societies and
individuals for which exchange accounts are kept is now 16,002.

The actual cost of the exchanges for the fiscal year, taking in ac-
count bills rendered and moneys received up to September 21, 1890,
for services rendered between July 1, 1889, and June 30, 1890, was
$17,401.23. Of this sum $15,000 were appropriated directly by Con-
gress, $1,986.14 were repaid by several Government bureaus to which
appropriations had been made for the purpose, $28.40 was received
from State institutions and other sources, leaving a deficiency of
$386.69, which was paid from the Smithsonian fund.

In my report for last year I had the honor to submit detailed esti-
mates showing the necessity of larger appropriations by Congress if
the Exchange Bureau is to be placed upon a satisfactory footing.

The chief increase in outlay would be to secure a more prompt service
aud to increase the number of exchanges that are received for the Li-
brary of Congress, in return for the Government exchanges sent
abroad. Itis probable that the number of the latter would be largely
increased if special efforts were made to that end.

An improvement in the promptness of transmission to Europe has
taken place within the last few years, but packages are still unduly de-
layed by reason of the fact that we are not able to pay for rapid trans-
mission. The exchange boxes go by slow freight and we are in most
instances dependent upon the courtesy of the steam-ship companies for
free freight. The greater number of the publications now transmitted
are for the benefit of the Government and it seems unjust to continue
to make use of such privileges originally granted in the interests of
of science. The entire sum asked forewas $27,500.

Our exchange relations with foreign Governments have undergone
no material change on account of the treaty at Brussels proclaimed
January 15, 1889, to which allusion has been made in previous reports.

iu order to carry out in good faith, as far as our own country is con-

cerned, the convention relating to the immediate exchange of parlia-
mentary journals, a communication was directed to the honorable the
Secretary of State under date of December 12, 1889, stating the neces-
sity of procuring from Congress an appropriation of about $2,000 to meet
the expenses of transmitting abroad copies of the Congressional Record
and other published documents pertaining to the daily routine of Con-
gress; and a joint resolution introduced at the instance of the honorable
the Secretary of State was promptly passed by the Senate, appropriating
the sum named, $2,000. I regret, however, that at the close of the fiscal
year no action had been taken in the matter by the House of Repre-
sentatives, and in consequence no attempt has been made to give effect
to the treaty.

Tables showing in detail the transactions of the year will be found in
the report of the curator of exchanges appended hereto.

The progress of work on the new exchange list is mentioned under the
head of the library.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the library have been recorded and cared for as dur-
ing the last fiscal year.

The following statement shows the number of books, maps, aud charts
received from July 1, 1889, to June 30, 1890:

Of these accessions, 8,695 (namely, 785 volumes, 6,900 parts of volumes,
and 1,010 pamphlets) were retained for use at the National Museum
library, and 1,059 medical dissertations were deposited in the library of
the Surgeon-General, U.S. Army; the remainder were promptly sent
to the Library of Congress on the Monday following their receipt.

The reading room is now almost filled with periodicals. There are
at present displayed the current volumes of 468 journals. The con-
struction of shelves above the cases in the reading room has rendered
it practicable to withdraw from the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress the complete series of the large quarto Transactions or
Memoirs of most of the great European academies; the Librarian of
Congress kindly viving every facility for this transfer.*

*The publications now deposited in the reading-room are as follows: The ‘‘ Hand-
lingar” of the Royal Swedish Academy; Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh; Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy; “Skrifter” of the Royal Danish
Society of Sciences; “ Denkschriften” of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Vienna;

20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In my last report, I referred to the commencement of the work of
increasing the library by exchanges. This work has now been carried
on for a year with fairly promising results.

The labor of assigning the different journals recommended as desira-
ble to the four classes mentioned in my last report—namely, (1) journals
which receive no Smithsonian publications, and which are not to be
found in the library of the Institution; (2) journals which receive
Smithsonian publications, but which make either no return or an inad-
equate return for these; (3) journals which regularly exchange with
the Institution, but of which the files in the library are for any reason
defective; (4) journals which regularly exchange with the Institution,
and of which the library possesses a complete file—occupied the time
until January 18, 1890. The writing of letters asking for exchange or
calling attention to deficiencies was then commenced systematically.

Up to the close of the fiscal year, 1,601 such letters had been written.
In response to these letters, 201 new exchanges were received and 360
defective series were completed, either wholly or as far as the missing
parts were still in print.

A list of the new exchanges is presented in the Appendix (Report of
the Librarian) where will also be found a list of the most important
accessions outside of the regular serials.

The work of re-organization of the library under the regulations which
I had prepared upon my appointment as Assistant Secretary, and de-
scribed at some length in my report for the years 1887~88, has been
efficiently carried out by the librarian, Mr. Murdoch. I may also men-
tion that a plan is under consideration for the further extension of the
usefulness of the library, by establishing as a part of it a collection of
books on general literature for the use of the employés of the Instita-
tion and its dependencies, although in its present location its growth is
impeded for lack of room, owing to the pressing demands of the Gov-
ernment business in the Exchange Bureau.

MISCELLANEOUS,

Statue of Professor Baird.—I desire to call the attention of the Re-
gents to the fact that the bill introduced in the Senate and passed by
that body on February 10, 1888, making an appropriation for the erec-
tion of a bronze statue in recognition of the distinguished services to
the country of the late Professor Baird, has failed to reach final action
by Congress. I earnestly hope that steps will be taken to secure for
this measure the attention it merits, and I continue to give it my per-
sonal care.

Grants in aid of the physical sciences—In accordance with an early
established precedent, though one of late in disuse, some small grants,

Carolinw Germanice Nature Curiosorum; Abhandlungen ” of the Berlin Academy;
“Nova Acta” of the Academy of Upsala. In addition to these the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society, and the “ Comptes-Rendus” of the French Aca-
demy of Sciences have been deposited in the office of the editor.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

‘from the Smithonian fund, commensurate rather with the abilities of
the Institution than with its wishes, have been made this year to aid
in physical science in addition to the aid so largely given to bioloigeal
and ethnological science through the Museum, Bureau of Ethnology,
and Zoological Park.

The subscription of twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal,
which are distributed abroad as exchanges of the Institution, has been
continued.

To the Lick Observatory, through its director, Professor Holden, a
small grant has been made for the purchase of photographie plates
and apparatus to be used in securing photographs of the moon, and es-
pecially of certain regions on a large scaie, the results of the work be-
ing available for publication by the Institution.

Aid has also been promised Prof. Albert A. Michelson, of Clark
University, Worcester, Mass., in his important investigations for the
determination of a standard of length that shall depend upon the length
of a wave of light.

A small grant has been made to Mr. F. A. Seely, of the United States
Patent Office, for the purchase of certain objects of archeological in-
terest, during the course of a contemplated journey in Spain.

Assignment of rooms for scientific work.—A room in the basement,
which is specially suited for delicate physical measurements, on account
of its freedom from tremor, has been continued at the disposal of the
U. 8. Coast and Geodetic Survey for pendulum experiments, and two
office rooms have also been assigned to the temporary use of the
Zoological Park Commission. The Regents’ room, in the south tower,
was granted for a meeting of the American members of the committee
on the “ International Standards for Iron and Steel” on February 19,
1899.

Facilities for study in the Museum have been accorded to a number
of students, as stated in describing the Museum work, and under special
conditions instruction has been given in taxidermy and photography.
The lecture hall in the Museum has been used by authority of the Exec-
utive Committee for the meetings of the National Academy and other
scientific organizations and for the Saturday lecture courses.

Toner lecture fund.—This fund, which hasan estimated value of about
$3,000, is in the care of a board of trustees, of which the secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution is ex officio chairman. No lecture has been
delivered this year under the auspices of this fund. The lecture de-
livered by Dr. Harrison Allen, on May 29, 1889, on the “Clinical Study
of the Skull,” has been printed.

American Historical Association.—A bill to incorporate the Ameri-
can Historical Association, which provided that the Association should
report annually to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and that
the Secretary should communicate to Congress the whole of such re-
ports, or such portion thereof as he might see fit, finally became a iaw
on January 4, 1889.
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In December, 1889, the annual meeting of the Association took place
in Washington, the morning session being held in the lecture hall of
the National Museum and the evening session in the Columbian Univer-
ity. The proceedings of this meeting are printed in the annual report
of the association, which, in accordance with the provisions cited above,
was submitted to me on January 14, 1890, and on June 18 was commu-
nicated to Congress and ordered to be printed as Senate Miscellaneous
Document No. 170. This report included, in addition to the proceed-
ings of the annual meeting, a number of historical papers of a high
order,

The provision by which the Regents are authorized to permit the
deposit of the collections, manuscripts, books, pamphlets, and other
historical material of the Association, has been met as well as our pres-
ent accommodations will admit, and in making an estimate for repairs
to the Smithsonian buildings arrangements were made for a suitable
and safe place in which such valuable records might be stored.

Bureau of fine arts.—The desirability of having in connection with
the Government a suitable depository of works of art has presented
itself so forcibly to Members of Congress, and without suggestion on
the part of the Regents, that a bill was introduced in the Senate by the
Hon. Wilkinson Call, on December 4, 1889, providing for the establish-
ment of a bureau of fine arts in the Smithsonian Institution. This was
referred to the Committee on the Library, but has not been reported.

The wording of the bill is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That there be, and is hereby,
created in the Smithsonian Institution a bureau called the Bureau
of the Fine Arts, the management of which is entrusted to the Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Src. 2. That the purpose and duties of this bureau shall be to aid
in the development of the fine arts in the several States and Territories
of the United States, by the re-production, for the use of art schools and
academies, of casts of statuary and other objects used in giving instrue-
tion in art; by preparing and distributing plans for the construction of
buildings and the adaptation of rooms suitable for use as art schools,
with printed plans for the organization of various gr ades of art acad-
emies and classes; by causing to be held annually in Washington, Dis-
trict of Columbia, a public exhibition of works of art, open to all desir-
ing to exhibit, in which the fairest possible opportunity for exposition
shall be afforded all contributors; and by the publication of an annual
register containing an account of new discoveries, inventions and meth-
ods of instruction useful to students of art, together with a report of
the progress of the fine arts in the United States.

Src. 3. That the re-productions and publications of the bureau shall

be distributed amoug institutions of art, under such regulations as the
Secret: _ of the Smithsonian Institution may establish.

Src. 4. That the Seeretary of the Smithsonian Institution’ shall pro-
vide sit able quarters for the holding of the annual art exhibition.
Seo. 5. That for the purpose of carrying on the operations of this

bureau Thaie be and is hereby appropriated, for the fiscal year begin-

hing July Ist, eighteen hundred and eighty- , the sum of
dollars, to be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury out of any moneys
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and expended under the
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Capron collection of Japanese works of art.—A_ Dill appropriating
$14,675, introduced by the Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees on December 4,
1889, was referred to the Committee on the Library, was reported favor-
ably, and passed the Senate on March 29, 1890. It was also, on May
19, 1890, reported favorably by the House Committee, but was not
reached on the calendar at the close of the year.

The World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1892.—The act of Con.
gress approved April 25, 1890, which provides for celebrating the four
hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus, by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries,
manufactures, and the product of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of
Chicago, states in section 16:

That there shall be exhibited at said exposition by the Government
of the United States, from its Executive Departments, the Smithsonian
Institution, the United States Fish Commission, and the National
Museum, such articles and materials as illustrate the function and
administrative faculty of the Government in time of peace and its
resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate the nature of our insti-
tutions and their adaptation to the wants of the people; and to secure
a complete and harmonious arrangement of such a Government ex-
hibit, a board shall be created to be charged with the selection, prep-
aration, arrangement, safe-keeping, and exhibition of such articles
and materials as the heads of the several Departments and the diree-
tors of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum may respect-
ively decide shall be embraced in said Government exhibit. The Pres.
ident may also designate additional articles for exhibition. Such board
shall be composed of one person to be named by the bead of each
Executive Department, and one by the directors of the Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum, and one by the Fish Commission, such
selection to be approved by the President of the United States. The
President shall name the chairman of said board, and the board itself
shall select such other officers as it may deem necessary.

Under the authority conveyed by this act I have designated as the
representative upon this board of the Smithsonian Institution and Na-
tional Museum, the assistant seeretary of the Institution, Dr. G. Brown
Goode, who has already devoted considerable time to the subject of the
proposed exposition in addition to his other official duties.

In connection with this requirement that an exhibit shall be made
by the National Museum, I beg leave to recur to the fact that it has
been the experience in connection with previous expositions on a smaller
‘Scale, that the routine work of the Institution is seriously interfered
with by thus throwing upon its regular employés the great burden in-
volved in the preparation, packing, and displaying of Museum mate-
wial without adequate assistance by an increased appropriation during
this time of unusual effort. The impairment of specimens by frequent
transportation should also be borne in mind, and in justice to our per-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

manent exhibits provision should be made for repairing any damage
incurred.

Stereotype plates.—All the stereotype plates belonging to the Institu-
tion are now stored in the basement of the building, and some progress
has been made in examining, re-arranging, and where the boxes have
become worn out, in re-packing plates. Owing to the limited amount
of time that can be devoted to this work, however, it will be some months
before they can be put in a thoroughly satisfactory condition for ready
reference.

A request from Messrs. Lee & Shepard, of Boston, for the use of
plates from Professor Hyatt’s “Genesis of the Arietide” has been cheer-
fully complied with.

Correspondence.—I have given much attention to the improvement of
the methods of handling the correspondence of the Institution, which is
constantly growing and has already assumed very considerable propor-
tions. A simple but effective means of recording letters, showing at a
glance, what letters remain unanswered each week, has been intro-
duced, and as a result few letters remain long without reply.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the character of the cor-
respondence, except such as relates to business routine, is quite differ-
ent from that of Government bureaus. Constant inquiries are made
from all parts of the country for information on almost every conceiva-
ble topic, and requests for statistics and for information on the most
varying scientific subjects. It is intended that all of these inquiries
should receive acknowledgment, and,wherever possible, that the infor-
mation desired should be sent, thoughin many cases it requires an amount
of time and labor on the part of curators and other officers of the Insti-
tution wholly out of proportion to the merits of the case.

As properly coming under the head of “ diffusion of knowledge,” it
does not seem proper to neglect such inquiries, and it is intended to give
encouragement and advice wherever possible to all interested in the ob-
jects of the Institution.

The course taken by an incoming letter is now as follows: The
mail is opened each morning in the chief clerk’s office, and all letters
addressed to the secretary or the Institution, with the exception of
those on printed forms, purely routine matters, and applications for
Museum publications, are placed on the secretary’s desk at 10 o’clock,
together with letters for signature. Having been acted upon, the
date stamp of the secretary’s office is affixed to each communication
and the letter is then returned to the chief clerk’s office. Should
the secretary have written in his own hand the name of any em-
ployé or officer of the Institution upon a letter, such action means
that tbe letter is to be referred to the person named, who is expected
fo prepare a reply thereto for the secretary’s signature.

The one exception to this rule is whenthe secretary refers a letter to
the assistant secretary, who exercises his discretion as to whether the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

letter should be answered at all or not, and if so, whether he or the
secretary should sign the reply.

In case no comment has been made by the secretary, the disposition
of the letters is left to the chief clerk, who assigns them to the officers
or clerks having in charge the matter treated of. The letters are then
sent to the registry clerk, who affixes the registry number and records
the letter in a book suitably ruled with the following columns:

1. Registry number of letter. 7. By whom referred.

2. Name of writer. 8. When referred.

3. Address. 9. Date of answer, or indication no an-
4. When written. swer required.

5. When received. 10. Synopsis of contents.

6. To whom referred.

A special form is sent with letters referred to the Museum, by means
of which an accurate record of the disposition of the letter may be kept,
and a similar form is used for letters referred to employes of the Smith-
sonian Institution proper.

The object of this system is, as above stated, to insure that each let-
ter requiring an answer shall receive it with all attainable promptness,
or that a record shall be made of the fact that no answer is required,
and, as a rule, it is believed that letters are now being answered on the
day after receipt, except in the case of the somewhat numerous class
referred to, upon which the report of an expert is first necessary. In
the latter case, a limit of six days has been fixed upon from the date
of receipt in which to answer ordinary routine letters. A report is
rendered each week of the letters that are then unanswered. This
system, while entailing some additional labor, appears to be fully
justified by the results.

Representative relations.—In response to an invitation from Dr. Henry
Schliemann, forwarded through the Department of State, to designate
a representative of the Smithsonian Institution to participate in an
International Conference, held on the ruins of ancient Troy during the
latter part of March, 1890, Dr. Charles Waldstein, director of the
American School of Classical Studies at Athens, was requested to act
as representative of the Institution, and he has most kindly complied
with this request, transmitting an interesting report of the proceed-
ings of the Conference.

Prof. H. Carrington Bolton courteously represented the Institution at
the installation of Dr. Low as president of Columbia College, New York,
on February 3, 1890.

Prof. Otis T. Mason was appointed as the representative of the Insti-
tution upon a joint board composed of delegates from different bureaus
of the Government interested in the subject to consider and decide
questions of geographical orthography and nomenclature. This board
met for organization at the office of the Superintendent of the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey on the 18th of March, and its work is one
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

that has already proved to be of great value to the Government and to
others interested in geographical matters.

I take occasion to express to the Director of the Mint, the Hon. E, O.
Leech, my acknowledgments for bis kindness in having prepared an
intaglio head of the late Professor Henry for certain official correspond-
ence,—an excellent work of art.

U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The operations of the National Museum are fully described in the
separate Report of the Assistant Secretary, in which are included (1)
the report of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum ; (2)
the reports of the curators of the scientific departments of the Muse-
um; (3) special papers based upon and illustrative of collections in the
Museum ; (4) bibliography of the publications of the Museum and of
papers published by Museum officers and other collaborators; (5) a
list of the accessions to the Museum during the year.

Increase of the Museum collections.—A small number of specimens were
purchased during the year. The necessity of expending a considerable
sum of money in the purchase of new material becomes every year more
apparent. The donations of friends of the Museum are to a large ex-
tent miscellaneous in character, and they frequently duplicate, rather
than enlarge and complete, the various series of objects already in the
collections. The Museum has now reached a point where the complete
presentation of subjects by means of full suites of specimens is of the
highest importance, and this can be accomplished only by purchase.

The increase in the number of accessions during the year has been
less than in the preceding year by nearly 200 numbers. This is not
surprising, since no special efforts have been made to secure new
material, excepting in certain directions, in which the completion of
special series of objects was desired, in view of the crowded condition
of both the storage and exhibition space. This matter has repeatedly
been referred to in the more recent reports of the Institution and of the
Museum, and efforts have been made to obtain an appropriation from
Congress for the construction of a new Museum building. The Senate
has acted favorably in regard to the matter, but its action has not
received the support of the House of Representatives.

The contributions during the year, although less in number than in
the previous year, are, taken as a whole, equal in importance. Espe-
cially is this true in the case of material acquired from foreign countries,
and of collections received through the assistance of the Departments
and Bureaus of the Government.

The extent and character of the accessions during the year and each
year since 1881 is shown in the appended table. The total uamber of
specimens received during the year covered by this report is estimated
at $1,992.

1 No census of collection taken.
2The actual increase in the collections during the year 1889-90 is much greater than appears from
a comparison of the totals for 1889 and for 1890. This is explained by the apparent absence of any
increase in the Departments of Lithology and Metallurgy, the total for 1890 in both of these depart
ments combined showing a decrease of 46,314 specimens, owing to the rejection of worthless material.
3 Although about two hundred specimens have been received during the year, the total number of
specimens in the collection is now less than that estimated for 1889, owing to the rejection of worth-

less material.

4 The collection now contains between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens.
5 No estimate of increase made in 1890,
6 Included in the historical collection.

7Only a small portion of the collection represented by this number was received during the year

1889-'90.

! These numbers have reference ouly to speeimens received through the Museum, and do not include
specimens received for the National Herbarium through the Department of Agriculture.

2 Collections combined in October, 1889, under Department of Geology. The apparent decrease of
more than 50 per cent. of the estimated total for 1889 is accounted for (1) by the rejection of several
thousands of specimens from the collection, and (2) by the fact that no estimate of the specimens
in the reserve and duplicate series is included. Of the total fur 1890, about 16,000 specimens consist
chiefly of petrographical material stored away for study and comparison in the drawers of table cases.

3 Transferred to the National Zoological Park.

Catalogue entries —The number of entries made in the catalogue of
the several departments of the Museum during the year is 28,293.

The number of boxes and packages recorded by the registrar as having
been received during the year, and entered upon the transportation
record of the Smithsonian Institution, is 52,079. Of this number 827
contained specimens for the Museum. Although the total number of
packages received is more than three times as great as that for last
year, the number of packages containing specimens for the Museum is
only a little more than one-third of the number received during 1889.

Co-operation of the Departments of Government.—The friendly interest
displayed in the work of the National Museum by officers of the De-
partments of the Government has been continued. In no previous year
has the Museum had occasion to acknowledge more gratefully the cour.
teous assistance rendered by the Secretaries of the Departments and
the chiefs of many of the Bureaus.

Through the medium of the Department of State, several United
States ministers and consuls have brought their influence to bear in
obtaining for the Museum representations of the fauna and flora of the
regions in which they are residing.

The Secretary of the Treasury has extended the usual courtesies in
connection with the free entry of specimens. Special facilities have
been afforded in connection with the visit of Mr. Henry W. Elliott to
the Seal Islands of Alaska, which, it is hoped, will result in the addition
of several specimens of fur-seal, fishes, and other natural-history objects
to the collections. The Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Revenue Ma-
rine Division, the Life-Saving Service, and the Light-House Board have
assisted collectors for the Museum in special ways.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

Several officers of the U.S. Army have made valuable contributions.
The Quartermaster’s Department has extended important assistance in
connection with the transportation of bulky material for the Museum.

From officers of the U. S. Navy many collections have been received
from foreign countries, including the West Indies, Liberia, the Samoan
Islands, and Mexico.

Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Interior, the Museum
has received a very valuable collection of ethnological specimens from
the Indians of the Tulalip Reservation, Washington. The material
transmitted to the Museum by the U.S. Geological Survey is large in
extent and quite equal in importance to the collections received from
that source in previous years.

From the Divisions of Animal Industry, Entomology, Botany, For-
estry, and Ornithology and Mammalogy, in the Department of Agricul-
ture, numerous contributions have been received.

Distribution of Duplicate Specimens.—Collections of ethnological, zoo-
logical, botanical, and geological specimens, contained in two hundred
and one packages, have been distributed during the year to about one
hundred and twenty educational establishments at home and abroad.
A large number of duplicate sets of minerals and marine invertebrates
were included in these distributions.

Numerous applications for duplicate specimens, chiefly minerals, still
remain unfilled. It is hoped that during the next fiscal year it will be
possible to send out bird-skins and rocks also.

Museum Publications.—This department of the Museum work has
been unusually active during the year.

The Museum Reports for 1886 and 1887 have been published. Each
of these volumes contains several papers based upon collections in the
Museum by Museum officers and other collaborators.

Volume XI of the Proceedings of the National Museum, for 1888, has
been issued. This contains xi+703 pages, 60 plates, and 122 text fig-
ures. It includes eighty-five papers by forty-three authors, nineteen
of whom are officers of the Museum. The papers composing Volume
XII of Proceedings of the National Museum, for 1889, are twenty-nine
in number (Nos. 761-789); and were all published as separates dur-
ing the year, although the bound volume has not yet been issued.
Commencing with this volume the system of issuing sixteen pages at
a time—forming a signature—as soon as sufficient manuscript had
accumulated, has been discontinued. Each paper is now printed separ-
ately, in advance of the bound volume, and is immediately distributed
_to specialists.

Five numbers of the Bulletin have been published (Nos. 34-38, inclu-
Sive). Bulletin 34 relates to “The Batrachia of North America,” by
Prof. E. D. Cope. Bulletin 35 contains a ‘“ Bibliographical Catalogue
of the Described Transformations of North American Lepidoptera,” by
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. Henry Edwards. Bulletin 36 is entitled “Contributions to the
Natural History of the Cetaceans, A Review of the Family Delphinide,”
by Mr. Frederick W. True. Bulletin 38 has the title: ‘Contribution
toward a Monograph of the Insects of the Lepidopterous family Noc-
tuide of Temperate North America,” and is a revision of the species
of the genus Agrotis. This Bulletin, by Mr. John B. Smith, of Rutgers
College, New Jersey, was not actually published until after the close of
the fiscal year, although it was put in type during the year covered by
this report. The manuscript for other Bulletins relating to deep-sea
fishes, by Drs. G. Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, and to a descrip-
tion of the metallurgical collection in the Museum, by Mr. Fred P. Dewey,
has been transmitted to the Government Printing Office.

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects have heen pub-
lished by officers of the Museum and other specialists. They are re-
ferred to in the bibliography of Museum publications, constituting See-
tion Iv of the separate report of the Assistant Secretary.

Assistance to students.—The usual facilities have been granted to stu-
dents in the various branches of natural history, and several collections
have been lent to specialists for comparison and study. Dr. R. W. Shu-
feldt, U. S. Army, requested permission to study bird-skeletons. Mr.
Bashtord Dean, of the College of the City of New York, received fishes
for study; a collection of bats from the British Museum was furnished
to Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia, for comparison and study; a part
of the Museum collection of Coleoptera was sent for a similar purpose to
Capt. T. L. Casey, of New York City. Several persons have received
instruction in taxidermy and photography.

Special researches.—Several of the curators in the Museum are pre-
paring for publication in the Museum Report for 180 papers which are
the result of special investigation and research. Among these may be
mentioned a hand-book of the geological collections, by Mr. George P.
Merrill; a descriptive paper relating to the collection of humming-birds
in the Museum, by Mr. Robert Ridgway; papers relating to Japanese
religion and Japanese burials, by Mr. Romyn Hitchcock. Other gen
tlemen, not officially connected with the Museum, have also prepared
papers for publication in the same volume.

The Museum Report each year contains a number of descriptive
papers of the kind alluded to, and the interest which they have excited
among all classes of people has been very great. During this year sev-
eral hundred copies of papers of this character, printed in the more re-
cently published reports of the Museum, have been distributed free of
cost. Among these may be especially noted the ** Hand- Book and Cata-
logue of the Building and Ornamental Stones in the National Museum,”
by Mr. George P. Merrill,* and the paper entitled “The Extermination
of the American Bison,” by Mr. William T, Hornaday.”t

* Printed in the report for 1836 and also separately.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. All|

Museum library.—The number of publications added to the Library
during the year is 12,437, of which 1,479 are volumes of more than 100
pages, 2,250 pamphlets, 8,672 parts of regular serials, and 36 charts.
With the exception of the charts these numbers are more than double
the receipts of last year. The most notable gift was a nearly complete
set of Kiener’s *“‘ leconographie des Coquilles Vivantes,” illustrated with
very beautifully colored plates. This was presented by the Wagner
Free Institute of Science, in Philadelphia.

Museum labels —During the year 3,920 forms of labels have been
printed (twenty-four copies of each form) for use in connection with
labeling the collections of ethnology, geology, mammals, comparative
anatomy, porcelains, oriental antiquities, graphic arts, foods, textiles,
and materia medica.

Meetings and lectures.—The use of the Lecture Hall has been granted
for lectures and meetings of scientific societies, as The Association of
American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, November
12-15, 1889, inclusive; the American Historical Association, December
28-31; the American Institute of Mining Engineers, February 18, 1890;
Memorial Meeting of the Academy of Sciences, March 27; the Geological
Society of America, April 17; the National Academy of Sciences, April
15-18, inclusive; Meeting of the Committee on Arrangements of the
Geological Congress, April 18; The National Geographic Society, May 2.

The course of Saturday lectures, ten in number, beginning February
1, and ending April 3, was delivered under the direction of the joint
committee of the scientific societies of Washington. A course of four
lectures relating to the anthropological exhibits at the Paris Exposi-
tion in 1889 was given in May by Mr. Thomas Wilson, curator of ar-
cheology. A lecture, under the auspices of the National Geographic
Society, was delivered on April 11 by Ensign J. B. Bernadou on the
subject of ‘Corea and the Coreans.”

Visitors.—The number of visitors to the Museum building during the
year ending June 30, 1890, was 274,324. The number of visitors to the
Smithsonian building during the same period was 120,894. These fig-
ures are considerably less than during 1889, when, on account of the
inauguration of President Harrison, immense numbers of people visited
the Museum. On March 5, it may be remembered, more than 56,000
people visited the Museum and Smithsonian buildings. The total num-
ber of visitors since 1381 to the Museum building is 2,111,949, and to the
Smithsonian building, 970,012.

Extension of hours for visiting the Museum.—On December 20 a bili

Crain, having for its object the opening of the Smithsonian and Museum
buildings during extra hours, Mr, Crain also introduced a bill later in

the session to provide an electric plant for lighting the buildings.
Neither of these bills has been reported from the committees to which
they were referred.

Museum personnel.—Mr. George P. Merrill has been appointed Curator
of the Department of Geology, which combines the functions of the
previously existing departments of Lithology and Physical Geology,
and of Metallurgy. This change in the administration of these depart-
ments was made upon the resignation of Mr. Fred P. Dewey, who for
several years had been in charge of the metallurgical collections.

Mr. William C. Winlock, of the Smithsonian Institution, was appointed
Honorary Curator of the Section of Physical Apparatus in the National
Museum.

Mr. William T. Hornaday, perhaps the first taxidermist in the coun-
try, through his extensive knowledge of the habits and natural atti-
tudes of animals, in a very wide range of travel as a field naturalist,
has elevated the standard of his art by the fidelity of his groupings and
his skill in the representation of life-like aspects in the plastic form.
He had rendered valuable service to the National Museum as its chief
taxidermist, and subsequently as Honorary Curator of the Department
of Living Animals, which led to his appointment as Acting Superinten-
dent of the National Zoological Park. From this position he resigned
on the 15th of June last.

Dr. Frank Baker was, in June, appointed Honorary Curator of the
Department of Comparative Anatomy in the Museum, though as it
has been found necessary to assign Dr. Baker to temporary duty as
Acting Manager of the National Zoological Park, Mr, F. W. True con-
tinues to fill the position of acting curator of that department.

A detailed statement relating to the work of the administrative offi-
cers of the Museum will be found in the volume containing the report
of the Assistant Secretary.

Hrplorations.—In connection with the expedition sent by the United
States Government to the West Coast of Africa to take observations of
the eclipse of the sun, the National Museum obtained the privilege of
sending a naturalist for the purpose of making collections of ethnological
and zoological objects. Mr. William Harvey Brown, of the National
Museum, was detailed to accompany the expedition. Early in June,
1890, the first colleetions were received as the result of his explorations.
They included mammals, fishes, insects, plants, reptiles, birds, shells,
rocks, and ethnological objects. Additional collections will doubtless
soou be received; and will be referred to in the next report. As an
outcome of Mr. Brown’s exploration work, collections have been re-
ceived from Rev. G. H. R. Fisk, Mr. J. H. Brady, Mr. P. MacOwan,
director of the Botanical Garden at Cape Town, Mr. Frye, of Cape Town,
and others, The thanks of the Smithsonian Institution are especially
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

due to several of the officers and sailors of the U. S. S. Pensacola for
assistance rendered Mr. Brown in his work.

Dr. W. H. Rush, U.S. Navy, has kindly offered to collect marine in-
vertebrates during his expedition to the Azores, Madeira, and the En-
glish Channel.

Mr. J. P. Iddings, of the U. 8S. Geological Survey, has expressed his
willingness to bear in mind the requests of the Museum during his ex-
pedition to the volcanic regions of Europe.

Mr. E. M. Aaron, of the American Entomological Society, has kindly
offered to be of service to the Museum in collecting entomological ma-
terial during his visit to Jamaica.

Mr. C. R. Orcutt, of San Diego, California, has announced his inten-
tion to visit the Colorado desert and the Gulf of California, and to
allow the Museuin to share the results of his expedition.

Mr. Henry W. Elliott, formerly of the Alaska Commercial Company,
is visiting the Seal Islands of Alaska on business connected with the
United States Government, and hopes to be able to secure for the Mu-
seum some fine specimens of walrus, fur-seal, fishes, and other zoolog-
ical material.

Department of living animals.—Upon the passage of the bill placing
the National Zoological Park under the care of the Board of Regents,
the department of living animals of the Museum was merged in the
new park and the necessary transfers were made from the Museum
rolls. For convenience, therefore, the report in regard to the principal
accessions to this department have been included in the report of the
acting manager of the Park.

The animals are retained for the present in their sheds in the Smith-
sonian Grounds for the reason that during the fitting up of the Park
they can there be cared for at a much less expense; for instance, two
watchmen are now required instead of twenty that would probably be
needed at the Park, where each group of animals will be placed in a
center from which to grow, a plan that involves the necessity at first
of spreading the collection over a considerable area.

The interest in this small collection has constantly increased, and
has been manifested by numerous offers of valuable gifts, most of which
it has been impossible, through lack of space and immediate accommoda-
tions, to accept.

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL ZOULOGICAL PARK.

In the early part of this ceutury a naturalist traveling in Siberia
stood by the mutilated body of a mammoth still undecayed, which the
melting of the frozen gravel had revealed, and to the skeleton of which
large portions of flesh, skin, and hair still clung. The remains were
excavated and transported many hundred miles across the frozen
waste, and at last reached the Imperial Museum at St. Petersburg,
where, through all these years, the mounted skeleton has justly been
regarded as the greatest treasure of that magnificent collection.

Scientific memoirs, popular books, theological works, poems—in
short, a whole literature—has come into existence with this discoy-
ery as its text. No other event in all the history of such subjects has
excited a greater or more permanent interest outside of purely scien.
tific circles; for the resurrection of this relic of a geologic time in a
condition analogous to that in which the bodies of contemporaneous
animals are daily seen brings home to the mind of the least curious
observer the reality of a long extinet race with a vividness which no
fossils or petrifactions of the ordinary sort can possibly equal.

Now, I am assured by most competent naturalists that few, if any,
of those not particularly devoted to the study of American animals
realize that changes have already occurred or are on the point of taking
place in our own characteristic fauna compared with which the disap-
pearance from it of the mammoth was insignificant. That animal was
common to all northern lands in its day. The practical domestication
of the elephant gives to every one the opportunity of observing a
gigantic creature closely allied to the mammoth, and from which he may
gain an approximately correct idea of it. But no such example is at
handinthe case of the bison, the prong-horn antelope, the elk, the Rocky
Mountain goat, and many more of our vanishing races.

The student of even the most modern text-books learns that the
characteristic larger animals of the United States are those just men-
tioned, with the moose, the grizzly bear, the beaver, and if we include
marine forms and aretic American animals we may add the northern
fur-seal, the Pacific walrus, the Californian sea-elephant, the manatee,
and still others.

With one or two exceptions out of this long list, men now living can
remember when each of these animals was reasonably abundant within
its natural territory. It is within the bounds of moderation to affirm
that unless Congress places some check on the present rate of destruc-
tion there are men now living who will see the time when the animals
enumerated will be practically extinct, or exterminated within the lim-
its of the United States. Already the census of some of them can be
expressed in three figures.

The fate of the bison, or American buffalo, is typical of them all.
‘Whether we consider this noble animal,” says Audubon, “as an ob-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

ject of the chase or as an article of food for man, it is decidedly the
most important of all our American contemporary quadrupeds.”

At the middle of the last century this animal pastured in Pennsylva-
nia and Virginia, and even at the close of the century ranged over the
whole Mississippi Valley and further west wherever pasturage was to
be found. At thepresent time a few hundred survivors represent the
millions of the last century, and we should not have even these few
hundred within our territory had it not been for the wise action of
Congress in providing for them a safe home in the Yellowstone Park.

Now, for several reasons it has been comparatively easy to trace the
decline 6f the buffalo population. The size of the animal, its prefer-
ence for open country, the sportsman’s interest in it, and its relations
to the food-supply of the Western Indians, all led to the observation
and record of changes; and accordingly I have made special mention
of this animal in representing the advantages of a national zoological
park where it might be preserved; but this is by no means the only
characteristic creature now threatened with speedy extinction.

The moose is known to be at the present time a rare animal in the
United States, but is in less immediate danger than some others. The
elk is vigorously hunted and is no longer easily obtained, even in its
most favored haunts. The grizzly bear is believed to be rapidly ap-
proaching extinction outside of the Yellowstone Park, where, owing
to the assiduous care of those in charge, both it and the elk are still
preserved. The mountain sheep and goat, which inhabit less accessi-
ble regions, are becoming more and more rare, while the beaver has
retreated from a vast former area to such secluded haunts that it may
possibly survive longer than the other species which I have just enu-
merated, and which are but a portion of those in imminent danger of
extinction.

Among the marine forms the manatee still exists, but, although not
exterminated, it is in immediate danger of beecomimg so, like the Cali-
fornian sea-elephant, a gigantic creature, often of greater bulk than the
elephant, which has suffered the fate of complete extinction within a
few past years; at least it is uncertain whether a single individual
actually survives. The Pacific walrus, upon which a large native popu-
lation has always in great part depended for food and hides, is rapidly
following the sea-elephant, and so on with other species.

This appalling destruction is not contined to mammals. Disregard
ing the birds of song and plumage, to which the fashions of the milli.
ner have brought disaster, nearly all the larger and more characteristic
American birds have suffered in the same way as their four-footed con-
temporaries. The fate of the great Auk is familiar to all naturalists ;
but it isnot so well known that the great Californian \ alture and sev-
eral of the beautiful sea-fowl] of our coasts have met the same fate, and
that the wild pigeon, whose astonishing flocks were dwelt upon by Au-
dubon and others in such remarkable descriptions and which were long
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the wonder of American travelers, with the less known, but magnificent
ivory-billed woodpecker, and the pretty Carolina parrakeet, have all
become, if not extinct, among the rarest of birds.

Apart from the commercial value of its skins, the tax upon which
has paid for the cost of our vast Alaskan territory, the singular habits
and teeming millions of the northern fur-seal have excited general in-
terest even among those who are not interested in natural history. In
1849 these animals abounded from Lower California to the lonely
Alaskan Isles, and it has been supposed that the precautions taken by
the Government for their protection on the breeding-grounds of the
Pribilov Islands would preserve permanently the still considerable
remnant which existed after the purchase of Alaska and the destruction
of the southern rookeries. But it is becoming too evident that the
greed of the hunters and the devastation caused by the general adop-
tion of the method of pursuing them in the open sea, destroying indis-
criminately mothers and offspring, is going to bring these hopes to
naught.

For most of these animals, therefore, it may be regarded as certain
that, unless some small remnant be preserved in a semi-domesticated
state, a few years will bring utter extinction. The American of the
next generation, when questioned about the animals once characteristic
of his country, will then be forced to confess that with the exception of
a few insignificant creatures, rankivg as vermin, this broad continent
possesses none of those species which once covered it, since the present
generation will have completed the destruction of them all.

The Yellowstone Park is doing excellent work under the present
management, and too much can not be said in praise of the action
which has given it to the country. It is, however, also desirable and
necessary that, if these vanishing forms are to be preserved, there
should be some zoological preserve or garden nearer the Capital, where
representatives of all these races, not only of the land, but of the water
also, may be preserved under the care of those permanently interested
in their protection, in the charge, that is, of men who not only have
special professional knowledge of their habits and needs, but who may
be considered as having an unselfish interest in looking to their preser-
ration, and who may act as scientific advisers, whenever such advice
is deemed desirable by Congress or by the heads of Departments.

Is it realized that nearly all the principal animals indigenous to the
United States are either substantially extinct or in danger of becom-
ing so and is it sufficiently realized that, once extinct, no expenditure
of treasure can restore what can even to-day be preserved by prompt
action of a very simple and definite kind ?

It is such consi.’erations as these that have induced me to ask the
earnest attention ot the Regents, of Congress, and of the country to the
immediate necessity for action. The trust is unquestionably for the ad-
vancement of science as well as for the instruction and recreation of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

the people, and thus becomes a fitting object for the care of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

In my Report for last year the preliminary steps for the establish-
ment of a Zoological Park in the District of Columbia were detailed.
The District of Columbia bill, which received the approval of the Presi-
dent on March 2, 1859, contained an appropriation of $200,000 for the
purchase of the land and established a Commission, composed of the
Secretary of the Interior, the President of the Board of Commissioners
of the District of Columbia, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, for the purpose of selecting and acquiring a suitable site upon
Rock Creek.

The utmost care was exercised to keep within the limitsof this appro-
priation, and the Commission is even able to turn into the Treasury a
small balance upon the completion of its work. To accomplish this,
however, it was necessary to leave out a strip of land of about 8 acres
on the east side of the creek, which it seemed to the Commission very
desirable to secure, and I venture to express the hope that Congress
will see fit to make special provision for the purchase of the property at
an early day.

From a commercial point of view the enterprise has already proved
a most successful one, the land having risen in value since its condem-
nation from 200 to 300 per cent.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the ground had yet to be acquired.
A careful consideration of the property in the neighborhood of Rock
Creek, described in the act of March 2, 1889, had been made and an
area of 166.48 acres selected.* The difficulty of establishing the bound-
aries of certain tracts described in the older deedscaused a long delay,
but the survey was finally completed on the 21st of November, 1889.

* The following list shows the tracts in detail and the amount eventually to be
paid for each:

38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A map of the park, showing the location and quantity of each lot,
was filed in the public records of the District of Columbia. On exam.
ination of the list it will be seen that for 131.14 acres an agreement
was effected with the owners as to the sum to be paid. For 34.49
acres no such agreement could be made, and the Commission therefore
took the course prescribed by the act of March 2, 1889, for this con-
tingency, and petitioned the Supreme Court of the District to assess
the value of the land. This was done by three appraisers appointed
by the Court, and the finding of the appraisers was approved by the
President of the United States. At the close of the year title deeds had
already passed for the greater portion of the property. -

The site thus selected is, it is believed, admirably suited for the purpose
for which it is designed. Situated at a convenient distance from the
city in a region of remarkable natural beauty, it has a surface of great
variety, offering unusual advantages of varied exposure for animals re-
quiring different treatment. While some portions still retain the origi-
nal forest, others are cleared or covered by a dense second growth of
pine, excellent for cover and producing conditions similar to those of
the natural haunts of many of the animals it is proposed to preserve.
An abundant supply of water is furnished to the lower portions by Rock
Creek, a small perennial stream that during freshets swells to consid-
erable size, and at intervals of years, to rare but destructive floods.
A number of small runlets or “ branches ” fall into the creek giving an
effective drainage to all parts of the park. The system of water ways
has for the most part been cut by erosion, so that the hill-sides and
valleys usually present smooth, rounded slopes, practicable for roads and
walks; yet this isagreeably varied at several places by an outcropping
of the underlying rock, giving a somewhat bolder character.

In the Appendix will be found a map showing the situation of the
Zoological Park with reference to the city of Washington, and follow-
ing if a second map giving, on a somewhat larger scale, the outline of
the park and its principal topographieal features.

Having obtained the site it became necessary to procure means for
the organization and maintenance of the park. The Commission ac-
cordingly, under date of January 16, 1890, addressed a letter to Con-
gress, concluding with the following words:

Before the expiration of the present fiscal year the Zoological Park
Commission will have completed the duties with which it was charged
by the act of Congress which called it into existence, and the title to
the lands it has purchased will be vested in the United States. Pend-
ing the completion of the condemnation proceedings now in progress,
and the submission of a final report, it is extremely desirable that Con-
gress should enact further legislation in regard to the park. The Com-
mission has no authority to put up fences and lay out roads or grounds,
or to erect buildings, nor is it even certain that it has the right to ae-
cept donations. The park is declared by Congress to be “ for the ad-
vancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.”
In the construction of ponds and lakes, and the erection of inclosures
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

and buildings for the purposes of zoological science, a stage will soon
be reached where scientific direction seems obviously desirable; and it
is respectfully represented to Congress that any means for laying out
and improving the grounds can be most advantageously used in view
of the purpose of Congress as to the ultimate disposition of the park
now when the foundations of its future usefulness are being laid. If
the very considerable collection of living animals now in the custody of
the Smithsonian Institution is to form the nucleus of the zoological park
collection its transter should be eftected by legislative enactment and
suitable measures taken for its maintenance. The Commission is of the
opinion that the collection referred to should, with the consent of the
Regents of the Institution, be transferred to the Zoological Park as soon
as possible after the Government takes full possession of the site.

Secretary of the Interior,

Commissioners for the establishment of a Zoological
Park in the District of Columbia.

After thorough consideration the following act was passed placing
the park under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and transferring to it the collection formerly under the charge of
the United States National Museum:

AN ACT for the organization, improvement, and maintenance of the National Zoolog-
ical Park.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the one-half of the fol-
lowing sums named, respectively, is hereby appropriated out of any
money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and the other half
out of the revenues of the District of Columbia, for the organization,
improvement, and maintenance of the National Zoological Park, to be
expended under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and to be drawn on their requisition and disbursed by the dis-
bursing officer for said Institution:

For the shelter of animals, fifteen theusand dollars.

For shelter-barns, cages, fences, and inclosures, and other provisions
for the custody of animals, nine thousand doilars.

For repairs to the Holt mansion, to make the same suitable for oceu-
pancy, and for office furniture, two thousand dollars.

For the creation of artificial ponds and other provisions for aquatic
animals, two thousand dollars.

For water supply, sewerage, and drainage, seven thousand dollars.

For roads, walks, and bridges, fifteen thousand dollars.

For miscellaneous supplies, materiais, and sundry incidental expen-
Ses not otherwise provided for, five thousand dollars.

For current expenses, including the maintenance of collections, food
supplies, salaries of all necessary employees, and the acquisition and
transportation of specimens, thirty-seven thousand dollars.

Sec. 2. That the National Zoological Park is hereby placed under the
directions of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, whe are author-
ized to transfer to it any living specimen, whether of animals or plants,
now or hereafter in their charge, to accept gifts for the park at their

discretion, in the name of the United States, to make exchanges ot
specimens, and to administer the said Zoological Park for the advance-
ment of science and the instruction and recreation of the people.

Sec. 3. That the heads of Executive Departments of the Government
are hereby authorized and directed to cause to be rendered all neces-
sary and practicable aid to the said Regents in the acquisition of col-
lections for the Zoological 4Park.

Approved, April 30, 1890.

As it seemed desirable to have at once expert advice on the subject
of laying out and improving the park, Mr. I’rederick Law Olmsted, a
distinguished landscape gardener, was requested to make a preliminary
inspection of the ground and to express an opinion as to what, under
the conditions imposed by the primary objects of the law, would be
the best general disposition to make of it. Itsoon became evident that
a further survey was necessary in order to fix the boundaries of the
maximum rise to be expected from Rock Creek. This stream, ordina-
rily small, drains a water-shed having an area of some 83 square miles,
with a slope so considerable that after copious rains the water rapidly
rises far beyond its usual limits and becomes destructive to any build-
ings or other fixtures situated along its course. A remarkable inunda-
tion of this character occurred in June, 1889, the extent of which was
noted at several points along the creek. It would be evidently im-
practicable to place any buildings of importance within the area sub-
ject to these heavy floods, and the suitable locations and plans for the
bridges to be constructed could not be prepared until their height and
span were determined with reference to the maximum rise of water.
The survey of the creek was not completed at the close of the year, but
it has since been finished as shown in the map previously referred to.

Having once secured the picturesque features of the land from oblit-
eration by the rapid encroachment of the city, it has been the policy to
proceed slowly with improvements and to utilize the natural advantages
of the location, interfering as little as possible with its original aspects.
Even with chess economical principles the cost of converting the tract
to the uses of a park is far beyond what would ordinarily be imagined,
for it should be remembered that the cost of improving Central Park,
New York, has already been not less than $14,000 per acre, and that of
Prospect Park, Brooklyn $9,000 per acre, while that of the large Frank-
lin Park, Boston, is estimated at $2,900 per acre.

In following this policy and keeping within the limits of the appro-
priations, no immediate provision has been made for the considerable
expense involved in opening at once to the public the entire area of 166
acres. The complete establishment of the park in a manner befitting
its national character will be a work of considerable time, and for the
present it has been deemed advisable to set aside nearly 40 acres, se-
lected on account of accessibility and moderate elevation, as well as on
account of its being adapted to the purposes of the park without great
expense, while a further tract of some 15 acres will be so arranged that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

it can be opened to the public, though it may not have a strictly park-
like cultivation. There will thus be free to the public, it is hoped by
next year, between 50 and 60 acres, an area larger than that of the
Zoological Gardens in the Regents Park of London, or the Jardin des
Plantes of Paris.

A distinct area of some 10 or 15 acres will be reserved in another
portion of the park for administrative and other purposes requiring
seclusion, and will contain a lodge for the resident superintendent,
offices, stable, infirmary for animals, and a proposed laboratory.

It should be remembered that a most important feature of this under-
taking is that it is not only a place for public resort and amusement,
but it is also intended to furnish secluded places for the breeding and
restoration of the various animals indigenous to this country.

At London and Paris the zoological gardens are chiefly for the
amusement of the people by the exhibition of curious and foreign ani-
mals, and for the benefit of the naturalist; our paramount interest is to
preserve the indigenous animals, and then to provide, in the words of
the act, for the instruction and amusement of the people.

Though anticipating the report for the coming year it does not seem
out of place in the present connection to allude to the fact that the See-
retary, in his private capacity, has been appointed by the Presidentone
of the commissioners of the more extensive national park upon Rock
Creek, contiguous to the Zoological Park, a charge which he has
accepted with some reluctance on account of the pressure of present
official duties, but with a feeling that by reason of the necessary inti-
mate connection between the two national parks the public interests
will be subserved by this action.

I can not close the report in relation to this new undertaking of the
Institution without reference to the loss we have sustained in the death
of Senator Beck, who, though not upon the Board of Regents, took a
lively interest iu the Institution, and a special interest in establishing
and placing under its care the preservation of the natural scenery in the
neighborhood of the Capital.

I regret, also, to report that near the close of the year, the Institution
was reluctantly obliged to accept the resignation of Mr. W. T. Hornaday,
curator of living animals in the National Museum, who, having been as-
signed to the duty of superintendent of the park under the Commission,
it was hoped would be able to accept the position of seperintendent of
the park uponits transfer to the Board of Regents. His efforts assisted
the Commission greatly in the selection of the land, and did much to
insure the success of the measure before Congress.

Dr. Frank Baker honorary curator of the Department of Comparative
Anatomy in the Museum, was appointed on June 1, 1890, acting mana-
ger of the Zoological Park.
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnologie researches among the North American Indians were con-
tinued by the Smithsonian Institution, in compliance with acts of Con-
gress, during the year 1889-90, under the direction of Maj. J. W. Pow-
ell, Director of the U. 8S. Geological Survey.

The work of the Bureau of Etbnology during the year has proceeded
along accustomed lines. Investigations in relation to the Sign Lan-
guage and Pictography of the American Indian, preliminary reports of
which subjects have appeared in annual reports of the Bureau,
have been discontinued and the final results of this study will soon
appear. Investigations of the Mounds of the eastern United States
have also been practically brought to an end and the final discussion
of the subject will speedily be published.

The archeologic researches which have been inaugurated in the vicin-
ity of Washington have already been fruitful of results of more than
local interest. Excavations into the quarry sites and workshops of
ihe district have shown that the class of archeologic objects from this
vicinity, which have hitherto been assumed to be palolithic and to
represent the rude implements of primitive man, are in fact nothing
but the ‘“‘rejects” of much more recent times; and that however far
back in point of time some of them may date, they are not separable
from the rejects of the historic Indian.

As usual, considerable attention has been paid to the collection of
linguistic material, both because it is thought that languages form the
only safe basis for classifying peoples, and because no material relating
to our Indians is vanishing with such rapidity. The latter reason has
also impelled the collection of Indian mythology. Myths are hardly
more enduring than the languages in which they are preserved. Though
they may persist to some extent after a language decays and falls into
partial disuse, it is only in a degraded and emasculated form that de-
prives them of their chief value, as embodying the religious ideas and
the philosophy of primitive peoples.

The medicine practices of the Indian have also received much atten-
tion and a Jarge number of the plants used in the Indian Materia
Medica have been collected, preserved, and their Indian and botanical
names obtained. In addition, the formulas and secret practices attend-
ing their use have been carefully recorded. As was to be expected, it
has been found that so intimately interwoven are the Indian systems
of religion and medicine that it is practically impossible to say where
the one ends and the other begins. It has also been demonstrated that
contrary to popular belief, the chief and almost sole effacacy possessed
by so-called Indian medicine lies, not in the inherent virtue of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

plants used, but in the mystic properties imparted to them by the sor-
cerers or professional ‘* Medicine men.”

During the year one of the Bureau assistants visited Casa Grande,
in Arizona, with a view to determining the best method to give effect
to the act passed by Congress for preserving the ancient ruin. The
preservation from the hand of the vandal and the effects of time and
exposure of the more important Indian mounds and ruins which are
situated within the national domain, is one that may well receive at-
tention. The land upon which many of them are situated is of little
value for economic purposes, and the comparatively small outlay re-
quired for their restoration, when such is necessary, and for their pres-
ervation, is small when contrasted with their historical and archzologi-
cal value and their popular interest.

No phase of tribal life and society presents a more curious and inter-
esting study than that exhibited by the Pueblo Indians, who, in many
respects, were far in advance of less sedentary tribes. Study of one of
them, Sia, was begun during the year, and other Pueblos will be visited
and studied in succession.

Further details respecting the work of the Bureau will be found in
the report of its director, Major J. W. Powell, given in full in Appen-

NECROLOGY.
SAMUEL SULLIVAN Cox.

I am called upon to record here the death of one of the most public-
spirited and versatile members of Congress that have served upon the
Board of Regents, the Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox, a member of the
House of Representatives, who was born at Zanesville, Ohio, Septem-
ber 30, 1824, and first elected a Regenton December 19,1861. He died
at his home in New York on the 10th of September, 1889.

At a meeting of the Board, held on the 8th of January,. 1890, a com-
mittee was appointed to prepare resolutions on the services and char-
acter of Mr. Cox, consisting of the Secretary, Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
Dr. Welling, and Hon. Mr. Lodge, and they subsequently reported as
follows:

To the Board of Regents:

Your committee report that the Hon. S. 8S. Cox was first appointed a
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1861, and that he
filled that office, except for intervals caused by public duties, to the
time of his death.

While he was not aregular attendant at all the meetings of the Board,
he was ever ready to advance the interests of the Institution and of
science, either as a Regent or as a member of Congress; and although
such men as Hamlin, Fessenden, Colfax, Chase, Garfield, Sherman,
Gray, and Waite, in a list comprising Presidents, Vice-Presidents,
Chief-Justices, and Senators of the United States, were his associates,
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

there were none whose service was longer or more gratefully to be re-
membered, nor perhaps any to whom the Institution owes more than
to Mr. Cox. :

The regard in which his brother Regents held Mr. Cox’s accuracy of
characterization and his instinctive recognition of all that is worthiest
of honor in other men may be inferred from the eulogies which he was
requested by them to deliver among which may be particularly men-
tioned the one at the commemoration in honor of Professor Henry in
the House of Representatives. But though these only illustrate a very
small part of his services as a Regent, your committee are led by their
consideration to recall that his first act upon your Board was the prep-
aration and delivery of an address at the request of the Regents on their
late colleague, Stephen A. Douglas, and that on this occasion he used
words which your committee permit themselves to adopt, as being in
their view singularly characteristic of Mr. Cox himself: :

“It was not merely as one of its Regents that he showed himself the
true and enlightened friend of objects kindred to those of this estab-
lishment; he ever advocated measures which served to advance knowl-
edge and promote the progress of humanity. The encouragement of
the fine arts, the rewarding of discoverers and inventors, the organiza-
tion of exploring expeditions, as well as the general diffusion of educa-
tion, were all objects of his special regard.”

In view of these facts it is—

Resolved, That in the death of Hon. Samuel Sullivan Cox the Smith-
sonian Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of a long-tried friend,
the Board of Regents of a most valued associate and.active member dur-
ing fifteen years of service, and the country of one of its most distin-
guished citizens.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to express their deep
sympathy with the bereaved family of the deceased, and that a copy
of these resolutions be transmitted to the widow of their late associate.

Mr. Cox was descended from a long line of distinguished ancestors.
His father, Hon. Ezekiel Taylor Cox, who moved from New Jersey
to Zanesville early in the century, held the position of State senator
and clerk of the supreme court of Ohio; his grandfather, General
James Cox, was an officer in the Revolution, speaker of the New Jersey
assembly, and member of Congress at the time of his death; his great-
grandfather, Judge Joseph Cox, was a distinguished man of his time,
as were his great-great-grandfather, James Cox, and his great great-
great-grandfather, Thomas Cox, one of the original proprietors of the
province of East New Jersey.

‘Upon the completion of a classical course Mr. Cox studied law, and at
theage of twenty-five, turning his attention to journalism, was the editor
of the Columbia Statesman; at twenty-nine he was the chairman of
the committee of the Democratic party of Ohio. When scarcely more
than thirty he was offered an appointment as secretary of legation to
Great Britain, but declined the honor, though he afterwards accepted
& similar position and represented the United States at Peru. At
thirty-two he was elected to Congress aad continued as a member of
that body, almost without interruption, for a period of over thirty years.
He was elected Speaker pro tempore of the House of Representatives
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

in 1876, and was minister to Turkey during the first part of President
Cleveland’s administration, receiving from the Sultan shortly after this
mission the degree of the order of the Mejidieh.

Of Mr. Cox’s political career it is unnecessary to speak. The unani-
mity with which his fellow-Congressmen hastened to pay tribute to his
memory, in terms most glowing and affectionate, attests his esteem in
the House of Representatives. No one upon the floor of the House of
Representatives in late years has appreciated more fully or has cham-
pioned to such an extent the cause of science. To him the scientific
departments of the Government looked for assistance and appreciation ;
as a member of the Board of Regents he was a firm supporter of the
liberal policy laid down for the Institution by Professor Henry.

Respectfully sabmitted.
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDICES TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the work of the year,
dividing it for convenience into two general heads, viz, field work and office work.

FIELD WORK.

The field work of the year is divided into (1) mound explorations and (2) general
field studies, the latter having been directed during the year chiefly to archxology,
language, religious practices, and pictography.

Mound explorations.—The work of exploring the mounds of the eastern United
States was, as in former years, under the superintendence of Prof. Cyrus ‘Thomas.
During this year he discontinued explorations in person, being engaged almost the
entire time upon the preparation of the second volume of his report and of an ad-
ditional bulletin, with accompanying maps of the archzologic localities.

Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, however, was employed during the summer in exploring
the works in Manitoba and the two Dakotas with special reference to their types and
distribution. The results of this investigation proved very satisfactory, as the types
within this area are found to be unusually well defined, according to physical struct-
ure and contents. While thus employed other archxological remains were noted and
examined, such as the bowlder outlines of circles and animals and the ancient village
sites on the Missouri River. A full report concerning these investigations will ap-
pear in the forthcoming report of Professor Thomas. Mr. Reynolds also made a visit
to certain earthworks in lowa and Indiana for the purpose of ascertaining their
types. In the autumn he was employed in South Carolina and Georgia exploring
the mounds of that section, about which little was known. Two mounds—a large
one on the Wateree River, below Camden, South Carolina, and one on the Savannah
River, Georgia—proved of special interest. The contents of the latter consisted of
as fine specimens of every class of primitive art as have been found in mounds.

Mr. James D. Middleton, who had acted as a regular assistant from the organiza-
tion of the division, wasengaged during the month of July, 1889, in surveying and
making plats of certain ancient works of Michigan and Ohio. At the end of the
month he resigned his position in the Bureau.

Mr. James Mooney, although engaged in another line of research, obtained impor-
tant information for the Mound Division, in reference to the location, distribution,
and character of the ancient works of the Cherokee in western North Carolina and
adjoining sections.

General Field Studies.—In the autumn of 1889 Mr. W. H. Holmes was directed to take
charge of the archzologic field-work of the Bureau. In September he began exca-
vations in the ancient bowlder quarries upon Piney Branch of Rock Creek, near
Washington. A trench was carried across the principal quarry, which had a width of
more than 50 feet and a depth in places of 10 feet. The ancient methods of quarrying
and working the bowlders were studied and several thousands of specimens were col-

47
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

lected. Work was resumed in the next spring and five additional trenches were
opened across widely separated portions of the ancient quarries. Much additional
information was collected, and many specimens were added to the collection. In
June work was commenced on another group of ancient quarries, situated north of
the new Observatory, on the west side of Rock Creek. Very extensive quarrying and
implement-making had been carried on in this place. The conditions and phenomena
were almost identical with those of the Piney Branch site. Subsequently an ancient
soapstone quarry near 'Tenallytown was examined. The ancient pitting corresponded
quite closely with that of the bowlder quarries and the condition of the pits indi-
cated equal age.

Dr. W. J. Hoffinan proceeded early in July to White Earth Reservation, Minnesota,
to continue the collection and study of mnemonic and other records relating to the
Midé’ wiwin or “ Grand Medicine Society ” of the Ojibwa Indians, He had already spent
two seasons with this tribe, and having been satisfactorily prepared, was initiated
into the mysteries of the four several degrees of the society, by which means he was
enabled to record the ceremonials of initiation, which was desired by the Indians, so
that a complete exposition of the traditions of the Ojibwa cosmogony and of the
Midé’ Society could be preserved for the information of their descendants. Through
intimate acquaintance with, and recognition by, the Mide’ priests, Dr. Hoffmann
secured all the important texts employed in the ceremony—much of which is in an
archaic form of speech—as well as the musical notation of songs sung to him for that
purpose; also the birch-bark records of the society, and the mnemonic songs on birch-
bark, employed by the Mide’ priests, as weli as those of the Jé’ssakki’d and the Wa-
béno’, which represent two other grades of Shamans.

The so-called cosmogony charts, four versions of which were secured, had not pre-
viously been exhibited to a white man, nor to Indians until after the necessary fees
had been paid for such service, preparatory to admission into the society.

He also secured, as having connection with the general subject, a list of plants and
other substances constituting the materia medica of the above-named locality, the
method of their preparation, administration, and reputed action, the whole being
connected with incantation and exorcism.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff made ashort trip (from December 7 to January 20) to the ruin
of Casa Grande, in Arizona, visiting also the sites of Mr. F, H. Cushing’s work while
in charge of the Hemenway expedition. Plans and photographs were secured on
this trip, and fragments of typical pottery were collected from the principal ruin
visited. Casa Grande was found to be almost identical in character with the many
ruins scattered over the valleys of both the Gila and Salado.

On July 3 Mr. James Mooney started on a third trip to the Cherokee reservation
in North Carolina, returning November 17, During this time he devoted his atten-
tion chiefly to the translation and study of the sacred formulas used by the Shamans,
obtained by him during a previous visit. In this work he employed the service of the
most prominent medicine men, among them being the writers of some of the original
formulas, and obtained detailed explanations of the accompanying ceremonies and
the theories upon which they were based, together with descriptions of the mode of
preparing the medicine and the various articles used in the same connection. He was
also permitted to witness a number of these ceremonies, notedly the solemn rite
known as ‘‘ going to water.” About three hundred specimens of plants used in the
medicine practice were also collected, with their Indian names and uses, in addition
to about five hundred previously obtained, These plants were sent to the botanists
of the Smithsonian Institution for identification under their scientific names. The
study of these Cherokee plant names, in connection with the medical formulas, will
throw much light upon Indian botanic classification and therapeutics. The study of
the botany is a work of peculiar difficulty, owing to the absence of any uniform sys-
tem among the various practitioners, Attention was also given to the ball play, and
several photographs of different stages of the ball dance were secured. One of the

.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. . 49

oldest men of the tribe was also employed to prepare the feather wands used in the
eagle dance, the pipe dance of the prairie tribes, and the calumet dance spoken of by
the early Jesuit writers, which has now been discontinued among the Cherokees for
abont thirty years. These wands were deposited in the National Museum as a part
of the Cherokee collection, obtained on various visits to the reservation.

A considerable amount of miscellaneous information in regard to myths, dances,
etc., was obtained, and a special study was made of their geographic nomenclature for
the purpose of preparing an aboriginal map of the old Cherokee country. With this
object a visit was made to the outlying Indian settlements, especially that on Cheowah
River, in Graham County, North Carolina, and individuals originally from widely-
separated districts were interviewed. ‘lhe maps of the Geological Survey, on a scale
of 2 miles to an inch, were used in the work, and the result is a collection of probably
more than one thousand Cherokee names of localities within the former territory of
the tribe, given in the correct form, with the meaning of the names and whatever
local legends are connected. In North Carolina practically every local name now
known to the Cherokees has been obtained, every prominent peak or rock, and every
cove and noted bend in a stream having a distinctive name. For Georgia and a por-
tion of Tennessee the names must be obtained chiefly from old Indians now living in
the Indian Territory. It may be noted here that asa rule the Cherokees and some
other tribes have no names for rivers or settlements. The name belongs to the dis-
trict and is applied alike to the stream, town, or mountain located init. When the
people of a settlement remove, the old name remains behind, and the town in its
new location takes the name attached to the new district. Each district along a
river has a distinct name, while the river as a whole has none, the whole tendency
in Indian languages being to specialize. The last six weeks of this field season were
spent by Mr. Mooney in visiting various points in North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Tennessee, and Alabama, within the former limits of the Cherokees, for the purpose of
locating mounds, graves, and other antiquities for an archeologic map of their ter-
ritory, and collecting from former traders and old residents materials for a historic
sketch of the tribe.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin spent July, and until August 28, 1889, at various points on the
Klamath River, from Orleans Bar to Martin’s Ferry, Humboldt County, California,
in collecting myths and reviewing vocabularies of the Weitspekan and Ehnikan lan-
guages. From August 30 to September 10 he was at Blue Lake and Arcata, Hum-
boldt County, California, engaged in taking down a Wishoshkan vocabulary and
collecting information concerning the Indians of the region thereabout. Arriving in
Round Valley, Mendocino County, California, September 16, he remained there till
October 16, and took vocabularies of the Yuki and Palaihnihan language. From
Round Valley he went to Niles, Alameda County, California, where he obtained partial
vocabularies of three languages formerly spoken in that region. Of these one was
spoken at Suisun, another was kindred to the Mariposan, a third was Costanoan.
On October 27 he arrived in Redding, Shasta County, California, where he obtained a
considerable addition to his material previously collected in the form of myths and
additions to the Palaihnihan vocabulary. During this work he visited also Round
Mountain. On January 10, 1890, he returned to office work.

From July 10 to November 9, 1889, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in field work.
Until September 7 he was on the Onondaga reservation, near Syracuse, New York,
where legends, tales, and myths were collected and recorded in the vernacular; also
accounts of the religious ceremonies and funeral rites were obtained, the terms form-
ing the Onondagan scheme of relationships of affinity and consanguinity were
recorded, and valuable matter pertaining to the league and its wampum record was
also collected. ;

From the last mentioned date to the 9th of November he was engaged on the Grand
River reservation in Canada, where he successfully made special effort to obtain the
chants and speeches used in the condolence council of the league. The religious doc-

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

trines and beliefs of the pagan Iroquois were recorded; plant and animal names were
collected; many religious and gentile songs were secured, and accounts of the prin-
cipal Iroquoian ‘‘ medicines” in the vernacular were obtained. A Wyandot vocabu-
lary was also recorded.

Mrs. T. E. Stevenson left Washington in March, 1890, to study the Sia, Jemez, and
Zuni Indians. She made Sia her first point of investigation, and found so much of
ethnologic interest in this Pueblo that she continued her work there to the end of the
fiscal year engaged in making a vocabulary and studying the habits, enstoms, mythol-
ogy, and medicine practices of these people. She has been admitted to the cere-
monials of the secret societies and has made detailed accounts of them, the altars
being photographed by Miss M. 8. Clark, who accompanied her. Her investigations
so far have resulted in a clear exposition of the religion of the people.

OFFICE WORK,

The Director was engaged during the year, when his other duties would permit, in
the preparation of a work on the.characteristics of Indian languages.

Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army, was oceupied in continued study of sign language
and pictography with the collection and collation of additional material obtained by
personal investigation, by correspondence, and by the examination of authorities.
This work was performed with special reference to the preparation for early publica-
tion of a monograph on each of those subjects, that on pictography to be first pre-
sented. The re-arrangement and revision of material already published in the pre-
liminary papers on the sign language and on the pictographs of the North American
Indians which respectively appeared in the first and fourth annual reports of this
Bureau, and the insertion of matter obtained later by exploration and research, have
been conjoined with discussion and comparison. By this treatment it is hoped that
the monugraphs on sign language and pictography, having as their text the attain-
ments of the North American Indians in those directions, may contribute to the
understanding of similar exhibitions of evanescent and durable thought-writing,
whether still employed in other parts of the world or now only found in records of
material remains.

During the fiscal year Mr. H. W. Henshaw was engaged, in addition to his admin-
istrative duties, in assisting the Director in the final preparation of the linguistic
map of North America north of Mexico, and the accompanying report, which is now
completed and in the hands of the printer. He also began the final revision for the
printer of his dictionary of Indian tribal names.

Rey. J. Owen Dorsey completed his editorial work in connection with the publica-
tion of Riggs’ Dakota-English Dictionary. He wrote articles on the following sub-
jects: Measures and valuing ; The Dha-du-ghe Society of the Ponka tribe; Omaha
dwellings, furniture, and implements; Omaha clothing and personal ornaments;
Ponka and Omaha songs; The places of gentes in Sionan camping circles; Winne-
bago folklore notes; Teton folklore; Omaha folklore; The gentile system of the
Siletz tribes; and a Dakota’s account of the sun-danee. He revised some of his
Omaha and Ponka genealogical tables and began the arrangement of Kansa tables or
a similar character. He continued the elaboration of his monograph on Indian per-
sonal names, and completed the following lists in which the Indian names precede
their English meanings: Winnebago, 383 names; Iowa, Oto, and Missouri, 520;
Kwapa, 15; and Kansa, 604.

Dr. Dorsey finished the preparation of his texts for Contributions to North Ameri-
can Ethnology, Vol. 6, The Vegiha Language. Part 11. Additional myths, stories,
and letters, and corrected proof for the volume as far as page 651. He prepared w
manuscript of other Omaha and Ponka letters, to be published as a bulletin. He
began an article entitled “ A study of Siouan cults,” for which over forty colored
illustrations were prepared by Indians, under his direction; and of this article he

‘
2
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3)

completed four chapters, treating of the cults of the Omaha, Ponka, Kansa, Osage,
Iowa, Oto, Missouri, and Winnebago tribes, and half of a fifth chapter that describes
the cults of the Dakota and Assiniboin. When not otherwise engaged, he was occu-
pied in making entries on slips for the Gegiha-English Dictionary. From September
to December, 1889, he obtained from George Miller, an Omaha, who came to Wash-
ington to aid him, additional myths, legends, letters, folklore, and sociologic material,
grammatical notes and corrections of dictionary entries, besides genealogical tables
arranged according to the subgentes as well as the gentes of the Omaha tribe.

During the year Mr. Albert 8S. Gatschet was wholly engaged in office work. He
finished his last draught of the ‘‘ Klamath Grammar,” a language of southwestern Ore-
gon, making numerous additions, also appendices, as follows: Idioms and dialectic
differences in the language; colloquial form of the language; syntactic examples;
complex synonymous terms; roots with their derivatives. The typographic work on
the grammar was terminated, the proofs and revises having all been read by the au-
thor. The last portion of the entire work, being the ‘ethnographic sketch of the
Klamath people,” was then re-written from earlier notes while consulting the best
topographic and historical materials obtainable. Mr. Gatschet also drew a map of
“the headwaters of the Klamath River,” the home of the tribes, being on a scale
of 15 miles to the inch, which will appear as the frontispiece in Part 1. The
“ethnographic sketch” is now in the hands of the printer.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin was engaged from January 10 to June 30, 1890, in arranging
the myth material collected by him in the field and in copying vocabularies. The
Hupa, Ehnikan, and Wishoshkan vocabularies were finished and the Yana partly
done on June 30, 1890.

The office work of Dr. W. J. Hoffman consisted in arranging the material gathered
by him during the preceding three field seasons and in preparing the manuscript for
publication, which has been completed. During the first three months of the year
1890 a delegation of Menomoni Indians were at Washington, District of Columbia, on
business connected with their tribe, and during that period Dr. Hoffman obtained
from them a collection of facts relating to mythology, social organization and gov-
ernment, the gentile system and division of gens into phratries, together with many
facts relating to the Mitii/wit, or ‘‘Grand Medicine Society” as they term it. These
are interesting and valuable, as some portions of the ritual explain doubtful parts of
the Ojibwa phraseology, and vice versa, although the two societies differ greatly in
the dramatized portion of the forms of initiation.

On his return from the field in November Mr. James Mooney devoted his attention
to the elaboration of the sacred formulas already obtained. Two hundred of these
formulas, being about one-third of the whole number, have now been translated. In
each case the translation from the original manuscript in Cherokee characters is
given first, then a translation following the idiom and spirit of the original as closely
as possible, and finally an explanation of the medicine and ceremonies used and the
underlying theory. About one-half of the whole number relate to medicine. The
others deal with love, war, self-protection, the ball play, agriculture, and life-con-
juring. A preliminary paper with a number of specimen formulas will appear in the
seventh annual report of the Bureau. The whole collection will constitute a unique
and interesting contribution to the aboriginal literature of America. All the words
occurring in the formulas thus far translated have been glossarized, with granmatic
notes and references from the original texts, making a glossary of about two thousand
words, a great part of which are in the archaic or sacred language. Several weeks
were also given to the preparation of an archeologic map of the old Cherokee
country from materials collected in the field and from other information in possession
of the Bureau.

During the year Mr. W. H. Holmes has been chiefly engaged in the preparation of
papers on the Arts of the Mound Builders, to form a part of the monograph upon the
Mound Builters, by Prof. Cyrus Thomas. Four papers are contemplated ; one upon
52 REPORT OF TME SECRBTARY.

Pottery, a second upon Art in Shell and Bone, a third upon Textile Fabrics, and a
fourth upon Pipes. Three of these papers are well advanced towards completion.
In addition to this work he has prepared papers relating to his field explorations.
These include a report upon excavations in the ancient quartzite bowlder workshops
and the soapstone quarries of the District of Columbia, and a rock shelter in West
Virginia. Portions of these papers have been published in the American Anthro-
pologist.

Mr. James C. Pilling has continued to devote such time as he could command for
the purpose to the preparation of bibliographies of the languages of North America.
At the close of the fiscal year 1888-89 the proof-reading of the Bibliograpby of the
Muskhogean Languages was completed, but the edition was not ready for delivery.
It was delivered August 8, 1889.

After the Muskhogean Bibliography had been finished, work was at once begun on
the Algonquian, by far the largest of those yet undertaken. Much of the material
for this was already in hand, the collection having been gradually pursued during
several years preceding, and the greater part of the work remaining consisted in
assembling, arranging, revising, and verifying that material. August 16-22 were
profitably spent by Mr. Pilling in the Lenox, Astor, and New York Historical Society
libraries, at New York City, and the Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston Athe-
neum, and Boston Public libraries, at Boston, chiefly in verifying and revising the
material in hand. The first portion of the manuscript was transmitted to the Public
Printer November 15, 1889. At the close of the fiscal year final proof had progressed
to the two hundred and fifty-eighth page, carrying the work approximately half way
to completion.

From the 1st to the 10th of July, 1879, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged in collat-
ing and recording Iroquoian proper names, both of persons and places, as they occur
in the narratives of the early explorers and historians of the pristine habitat of the
Iroquoian peoples. Afterwards, to the 9th of November, he was employed in field
work.

Upon his return to the office and until the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in
translating and annotating the myths, legends, tales, and all of the other matter
which he had previously collected in the field; and in translating and recording for
easy reference, for the purpose of verification and exposition of the matter so col-
lected, the mythologic, ethnographic, and other anthropologic data found in the early
French narratives of the New World, and especially that which is found in the works
of Champlain, Lafitau, Charlevoix, and in the Jesait Relations. Much linguistic
material has been obtained from the translation8 of the matter which Mr. Hewitt per-
sonally collected while engaging in field work.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was personally engaged during the entire year on the prepara-
tion of his report on the field work and collections of the preceding seven years. A
bulletin giving the archeologic localities within the mound area, together with a
series of accompanying maps, was completed for publication. It will form a closely
printed octavo of about two hundred and fifty pages. His report, which requires
much comparison and reference as well as study of the works explored and objects
obtained, is progressing as rapidly as is consistent with proper care and due regard
for details, and will be completed and presented for publication during the next
fiscal year.

Mr. Henry L. Reynolds, on his return from field duty, assisted Professor Thomas
in the preparation of that part of his report and bulletin relating to those archzo-
logic districts the works of which he had visited. He then resumed the preparation
of his paper on the aboriginal use of metal. In May he made an examination of the
metal specimens in the private and public archeological collections of New York
City, and in June visited Providence and Boston iv search of certain rare historic
data relating to the early life and customs of the Indians, both in respect to the use
of wetal and to other matters. He was engaged in the office upon this work at the
close of the fiscal year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

During the year Mr. Victor Mindeleff was engaged upon a report on the architect-
ure of Tusayan and Cibola. This work was interrupted by a short field trip to the
ruin of Casa Grande, as mentioned under the head of field work, and was resumed on
his return from that trip. The report, toge'her with the data for its illustrations,
has been finished for publication. A report was also prepared on the repairs and
protection of the ruin of Casa Grande, on the Gila River, in Arizona. This report
was accompanied by diagram, plans, aud a series of photographs. He also was occu-
pied in an architectural discussion on this ruin, together with one on the ruins on
the Rio Salado, excavated by the Hemenway expedition, which were visited by him.

During the first four months of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was engaged
in revising manuscript and otherwise assisting Mr. Victor Mindeleff in the prepara-
tion of a report on Pueblo Architecture, his own portion of the report having been
previously finished. The report was handed in for publication in December, 1889.
He then commenced the preparation of a series of maps, upon which the location of
all known ruins in the ancient Pueblo country will be plotted, in order to show their
distribution. The maps were partly done and the plotting of the ruins was com-
menced. When completed the maps will show the location of all ruins mentioned in
literature or known to explorers and will be accompanied by a card catalogue con-
taining a description of each ruin and reference to the literature relating to it, the
whole forming a valuable record. It is intended that a résumé of this shall be pub-
lished.

During the year the work of the modelling room was continued under the direction of
Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, and was confined almost entirely to the enlargement of the
“duplicate series,” referred to in previous reports. The large model of Petiasco Blanco,
one of the Chaco ruins, reported last year as commenced, was completed, cut into sec-
tions for convenience of shipment, and boxed. A duplicate of a model of the Pueblo
of Tewa, the original of which was made in 1883, was finished and exchanged for the
original in the National Museum. The original was condemned and destroyed and
another duplicate was made for the duplicate series. A duplicate was also made of a
model of Schumepovi, and the original was put in order and added to the series. A
duplicate of a model of the Pueblo of Shipaulovi was also finished and added to the
same series. The original model of Casa Blanea cliff ruin was withdrawn from the
Museum, and a number of duplicate casts were made, one of which was finished and
re-deposited in the Museum. Duplicates were also made of models of Great Elephant
Mound, Great Etowah Mound, and two others. In the latter half of the fiscal year
work was commenced on the duplication of two very large models, one of Walpi and
the First Mesa, the other of Mummy Cave cliff ruin. The original models had been
very hurriedly made for the New Orleans Exposition, and, being cast in plaster of
paris, had suffered considerably in transportation. An attempt was made to cast the
models in paper, and in both cases the attempt was very successful. The first dupli-
cate of the Walpi model was completed and deposited in the National Museum, to
replace the original which was destroyed. The finished model weighed about 500
pounds, instead of 2,500 pounds, the weight of the original. The model of the
Mumny Cave was cast, but was no‘ finished at the close of the year. A second dupli-
cate of Walpi, for the duplicate series, was cast, but not finished, at the close of the
year. It will be divided into sections for convenience of shipment. Toward the
close of the year work was commenced on two new models which will be used to
illustrate a report of Mr. Holmes, upon his work of the Archeology of the District
of Columbia.

But one demand was made during the year upon the duplicate series. This was
for a number of transparencies to be exhibited as a part of the display of the United
States at the Paris Exposition. Sixty of these large photographs on glass were sent
and two grand prizes were awarded them. Upon the conclusion of the exposition
the transparencies were returned, and some damage suffered in transportation was
made good by the United States Commission.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

During the year nine models, ranging in size from 2 feet square to 14 by 5 feet, were
finished; twelve models, including duplicate casts, were finished but not painted ;
and four models were commenced and not finished.

Mr. De Lancey W. Gill during the year succeeded Mr. Holmes in the charge of pre-
paring and editing the illustrations for the publications for the Bureau. The fol-
lowing list shows the number of drawings that have been prepared under his super-
vision for actual publication during the year:

These drawings were prepared from field surveys and sketches, from photographs,
and from the objects themselves. No field work has been done by Mr. Gill’s divis-
ion during the year although many valuable drawings and photographs were pro-
cured in Arizona by Mr. Victor Mindeleff and in the District of Columbia by Mr. W.
H. Holmes.

The photographie work remains under the able management of Mr. J. K. Hillers.

During the year the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution was issued. It contains the introductory re-
port of the Director, J. W. Powell, 35 pages, with accompanying papers, as follows:
Ancient Art of the Province of Chiriqui, Colombia, by William H. Holmes; a Study
of the Textile Art in its relation to the Development of Form and Ornament, by Will-
iam H. Holmes; Aids to the Study of The Maya Codices, by Prof. Cyrus Thomas ;
Osage Traditions, by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey; the Central Eskimo, by Dr. Franz Boas.
The work forms a royal octavo volume of lviii + 657 pages, including a general in-
dex, and is illustrated by 546 figures in the text, 10 plates, and 2 maps in pocket.

Very respectfully,
J. W. POWELL,

EXPENSE.

The expenses of the Exchange Bureau are met in part by a direct appropriation
made by Congress in the following terms:

“For expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, fifteen thousand dollars.”

This is supplemented by appropriations to several Government Bureaus by which
they are enabled to pay a portion of the cost of the exchange of their documents at a
rate of 5 cents per pound weight as established by the Board of Regents. Smaller
sums have been received from State institutions desiring to make use of the service,
and the deficiency is paid from the Smithsonian fund.*

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian -
Institution on account of the international exchanges, as shown in his statement for
the fiscal year, dated July 1, 1890, were as follows:

the accounting officer's books and including the receipts and disbursements for the
fiscal year, entered up to September 24, 1890, was $17,407.30.

Fifteen thousand dollars of this sum ($17,407.30) were appropriated by Congress
directly to the Smithsonian Institution, $2,009.34 were repaid to the Institution by
Government Bureaus, $28.40 by State institutions and the deficiency, $369.56, was
immet by the Smithsonian fund.

Bills for the transportation of exchanges have been rendered to all Government
Bureaus receiving or sending publications during the year, except in a few instances
where the amount was trifling. The total received from such sources was $1,771.53,
as mentioned above.

It may not be superfluous to repeat the statement made in previous years, that this
method of meeting the expenses of the Exchange Bureau is extremely unsatisfactory
both to the Smithsonian Institution and to the Government Bureaus that have ocea-
sion to make use of the service, and Iagain recommend that a sufficient appropriation
be procured to cover the entire cost of the exchanges, thereby enabling it to under-
stand at a glance the exact amount appropriated for such purposes. At present the
appropriation is distributed through all the principal appropriation bills of the
Government.

In order to effect the desired change, that. is, to collect in a single item the entire
appropriation for international exchanges and at the same time to make allowances for
the payment of ocean freight, the sum of $27,500 was asked for, for the fiscal year
1889-90 based upon the detailed statements submitted in my last report. The amount
finally appropriated was $15,000, the same as that for the year preceding.

CORRESPONDENTS.

The number of correspondents now upon our books is 16,002, divided into societies
and institutions, individuals, foreign and domestic, as follows:

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

The exchange of official documents between the Government of the United States
and that of foreign countries has been carried on through the intermediary of the
Smithsonian Institution, though this exchange has only been placed upon a defi-
nite diplomatic footing since January 15, 1889, the date upon which the convention
signed at Brussels on March 15, 1856, was proclaimed by the President of the United
States. This convention, the text of which was given in fullin Dr. Kidder’s report on
exchanges for the year 1887-’88, provided that there should be established in each of
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

the contracting countries a bureau for the special transmission of the publications of
its Government, the transactions of its learned societies, etc., to foreign governments
and individuals, and for the receipt from the similar bureaus of other countries of
the publications of their government and scientific and literary societies. This in-
volves, as will be seen. but little or no modification of the present long-established
Smithsonian Institution exchange system, and it is hoped that the official recognition
of the value of such a service by so many governments will result in extending the
scheme that has been in operation here for the past forty years, the expense of which
has been borne largely by the funds of James Smithson.

in accordance with a provision made in the Brussels Convention the Governments
of the Argentine Republic and of Paraguay have signified their adhesion to the con-
vention, the former on September 3, 1889, and the latter on December 10, 1889.
The countries therefore included in the international agreement are:—The United
States of America, the Argentine Republic, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Paraguay, Portu-
gal, Servia, Spain, Switzerland, Uruguay.

While neither England nor Germany appear in the above list, both of these countries
have addressed inquiries to this institution through diplomatic channels with regard
to exchanges with our Government, and it is most gratifying to report that the Brit-
ish Government, through Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, has presented to the Govern-
ment of the United States, for deposit in the Library of Congress, an important col-
lection of the publications of the parliamentary and executive offices from the years
1882 to 1889, constituting a most valuable series of documents and forming apartial
return for the series of publications issued by our own Government since 1868 and
sent regularly to the British Museum. Moreover we have the assurance that this
valuable series will be continued in annual shipments.

The Government of Germany has also expressed its appreciation of the international
exchange service in such a way as to lead us to expect that it will in due time make
fitting acknowledgment of the series of United States Government publications pre-
sented to the Royal Public Library, and to the Library of the Imperial German Par-
liament at Berlin.

A second convention made at Brussels, and also proclaimed by the President on the
15thof January, 1889, provided fortheimmediate exchange of Parliamentary journals
and the like, but it had not at the close of the fiscal year been set in satisfactory
operation. An effort was made by a letter addressed to the Department of State on
December 12, 1859, to carry out the stipulations of this treaty as far as the United
States Government was concerned, and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of
State a joint resolution appropriating $2,000 for the purpose was passed by the Sen-
ate on January 22, 1890, but it has not yet been acted upon by the House.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

An inspection of the tables presented at the beginning of this report bears suf-
ficient evidence that the Bureau has not decreased in efficiency during the past year,
especially when it is considered that the increased number (6,606) of packages was
handled and accounted for with a decrease in the clerical force during eleven months.
At the close of the year there were but 321 packages on hand and the record work
was tolerably well up to date.

The distribution to foreign countries was made in 873 cases, representing 385 trans-

missions, as follows:

* Miscellaneous exchanges included in transmissions to Germany.
+ In addition to a large amount sent by mail.

t By mail.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the pro-
visions of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, has been 27,300, and there have
been received in return but 1,820 packages or volumes. The United States Govern-
ment Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad through the Bureau
16,496 packages or volumes, and have received in return 8,886. The total, then, of
the exchanges for the enrichment of the Government libraries has been 10,706 pack-
ages received and 43,796 packages sent abroad, a total of 54,502 packages, or 66 per
cent. of the total number of packages handled.

Of the 82,572 parcels received by the Exchange Bureau, 69,356 were for foreign
and 13,216 for domestic distribution.

While it is thus shown that more work has been done and with Jess force than in
the preceding years, I strongly recommend that a slight increase in the office force
be made in order that it may be possible to handle more rapidly the large and con-
stantly increasing amount of exchange material. An additional assistant in the ship-
ping room will, I am confident, prevent any reasonable complaints of delays in the
office proper. Delays that occur by reason of slow ocean transportation will be ob-
viated when sufficient appropriation is made to pay for freight; the delays that occur
in the foreign exchange bureaus or agents, except those in the pay of the Sinithsonian
Institution, lie of course beyond the control of the Institution.

The foreign agents of the Institution, Dr. Felix Fliigel, Leipzig, and Messrs. Wiil-
iam Wesley & Son, London, bave given the same careful attention to the interests of
the Institution as in former years and are entitled, as well as the immediate employés
of the Bureau, to my warmest thanks. Grateful acknowledgments are also due to
the following transportation companies and firms for their continued liberality in
granting free freight or otherwise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels
and boxes, while to others we are indebted for reduced rates in consideration of the
disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge among men.

62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Upon January 1, 1890, a new system of recording the correspondence was adopted,
having been submitted to a preliminary trial of several months to test its applicability
to the special wants of the office. Every letter or invoice received is assigned a cur-
rent number, and is entered at once in a book for the purpose, a card index facili-
tating reference to the letters filed chronologically. All out-going letters are entered
in a similar book.

The collection of scientific and other directories, Government year-books, and lists
of members of learned societies, has received a number of valuable additions, and it
is hoped that with increased funds at command and a diminution of more pressing
needs this collection will be made an important feature of the Exchange Bureau.

Perhaps the most serviceable information to those having occasion to make use
of the service is that contained in Exhibit A, appended, showing the number of
shipments each month to the various countries With which we are in correspondence,

Very respectfully yours,
WILLIAM C. WINLOCK,

Curator of Exchanges.
Mr. S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

It has hitherto been impossible to give suitable housing to these animals, most of
which are gifts tv the Government, and many of them are kept ina long, low shed,
imperfectly lighted and heated, wherein animals accustomed to the most diverse cli-

_mates are of necessity indiscriminately placed, the common Virginia opossum receiv-
ing the same heat and treatment that serves for the parrots and cockatoos. In an
annex to this shed the monkeys are placed, and it has been possible to give them
somewhat more suitable protection. The larger animals are confined either in sep-
arate out-door cages or in shelter-barns and pens, but these constructions are un-
suitable and insafficient even for the small number of such animals kept. Happily,
this condition is not a permanent one, as Congress has provided for the care and
maintenance of the collection in the National Zoological Park.

No zoological collection has ever been placed in a site so satisfactory. It is ample
in extent, being about four times larger than any zoological garden in this country
and from ten to fifteen times the size of most of the gardens of Europe. It is within
a short distance of the city, being but little over one-half mile from its limits (see
map No. 1) easily accessible by excellent roads; yet it has all the quiet and seclusion
of a remote country district. Within its bounds every variety of slope exposure is
found, from the north sides of hills covered with dense growth, suitable for animals
requiring coolness and shade, to the sunny southern aspects for tropical and sub-
tropical species. The natural variety of surface is also great. Rocks form natural
cliffs where wild sheep and goats can jump and climb; densely wooded portions form
an excellent cover for shy animals, and a large open field along the creek affords an
opportunity for excellent grazing grounds. In the creek itself aquatic animals and
birds may be suitably reared.

That the picturesqueness of the region is notable isshown by the names given to
different parts of it in the grants and early deeds of the eighteenth century. There
it is found that a considerable part of the park was known as ‘Pretty Prospect,”
also as ‘‘The Rock of Dunbarton,” while other parts are from the tracts of ‘‘ Mount
Pleasant” and ‘‘ Pleasant Plains.” The actual owners from whom the site was im-
mediately derived are shown on the accompanying map No. 2. A portion of it
was once owned by John Quincy Adams, who built upon the creek the ‘*Columbia
Mill,” for many years past known as ‘‘Adams’s Mill.” Fragmentary ruins of some
of the mill buildings still remain.

The only habitable building found within the limits defining the park was that
knownas the ‘“‘ Holt House.” This mansion is one of the few remaining in the District

- dating back to near the beginning of the century, it having been built in 1805.

Though in a very dilapidated condition, it is thought desirable to repair it, pre-

serving as far as possible its characteristic features, and it will be used for the offices
of the Park.

The original forest covering this land was doubtless mainly oaks, hickories, and
tulip trees. A portion of this was cleared away, and the land was probably cultivated
for many years. Being then allowed to lie fallow, there sprang up upon it a thick
second growth of scrub pines and cedars. A large variety of trees of natural growth
is found. <A list of those already noted that may be classed as indigenous follows:

ORNITHOLOGY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

This region has long been known to be, because of its seclusion and natural ad-

vantages, one of the favorite nesting gr

Columbia. At my request Mr. H. W.
thology, has made the special report whi
‘‘For many reasons the situation of th

ounds for the birds that visit the District of
Henshaw, a well-known authority in orni-~
ch follows:

e site of the National Zoological Park is seen

to be a wise one, and from no point of view do its advantages appear greater than as
a haunt of our native birds. A section which has long been known to be the chosen
home of birds and animals in astate of nature would seem to be a peculiarly fitting
abode for them in astate of captivity. It is certain that neither within the District
nor in the region immediately abont it is there a spot which is resorted to by such
numbers of birds, nor one where the rarer migratory species can so certainly be found.
The park region has long been familiar to every bird collector who has ever made
Washington his headquarters, and probably no area of equal size has furnished so
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

many specimens to the collection of the National Museum and of private collectors
as this.

“To appreciate its advantages asa haunt in which to study the habits of our
birds one must visit it in early morning about the middle of May. At this time
thousands of birds are eagerly winging their way to their northern homes, and the
little groves of pines and the outlying deciduous thickets are filled with hundreds of
warblers, flycatchers, and sparrows. Among others one may be pretty sure to find,
amid throngs of commoner species, numbers of Bay-breasted and Blackburnian
Warblers. Should the visitor carefully scan the low thickets a Mourning or Con-
necticut Warbler, rare birds indeed in this latitude, may, perchance, reward his
search.

“The Worm-eating and Kentucky Warblers are always present about that date,
thoughinsmall numbers. So, too, are the Yellow-bellied and Least Flyeatchers ; while
the Traills Flycatcher is an occasional visitant. There is a thicket on the west pank
of the creek which Lincoln’s Finch, long unnoticed in the district, visits each spring,
and I have seen seven or eight of a morning. The Scarlet Tanager, whose bright
colors arrest the eye of even the most careless, finds here a favorite resort, and the
Rose-breasted Grosbeak, always a prize to the collector, isa regular and common Vis-
itor to the tall oaks that cover the eastern slopes. The northeast corner of the park
is the only spot known to me where the song of the Summer Tanager may be heard
with anything like certainty, for it is one of our rarest summer visitors. Not so the
Olive-backed Thrushes. Several of the five species are common elsewhere, but no-
where do they all occur so abundantly as here, even the Gray-cheeked being numer-
ous. The above are but a few of many species that throng the tree-tops and brush-
piles at this time of year.

“To explain just why this spot of all others in the District should be the favorite
resort for our birds would be difficult. Rock Creek is elsewhere as well wooded as it
is here. Elsewhere its banks furnish far more picturesque places, and if we can
suppose that birds are influenced in their choice of a resort by the «esthetic sense,
why are not such places equally favored with their presence?

“T am inclined to believe that the answer is to be found in the somewhat prosaic
reason that the gentle slopes of the creek at this point invite the early sunshine, and
that the succession of woods, thickets,and open spots favor the presence of insects
and seed-produciug plants. In other words, that here the birds find the exact kind
of shelter they require and food in abundance.

“A list of the birds that are known to have nested within the limits of the park,
small though this area is, would include almost all the land birds credited to the
District. A catalogue of the birds of the District was prepared by Doctors Coues
and Prentiss several years since (1883), and published by the National Museum under
the title of ‘Avifauna—Columbiana.’

“As, however, having a more intimate relation to the Park, I subjoin a list of the
birds which are known to have nested within the Park area within recent years.
Many of them, it is to be hoped, will refuse to recognize as valid the exclusive
title of possession conferred by Congress, ana will continue to occupy their old
homes as theirs by squatters’ rights. Others doubtless, let us hope a small minority,
will prefer to yield their ancient titles and move to more secluded spots in the ad-
joining territory.

“But ninety-one species of land birds are known to breed within the limits of the
District, and the following list shows that of this number sixty-one species, or
more than 76 per cent., breed regularly or occasionally within the Park. The
superior advantages it offers to bird life will therefore be readily appreciated,”

Many other creatures likewise find a natural home within these limits, and though
no systematic collection has yet been made, there has been observed during the sea-
son in the Park or its immediate vicinity the common woodchuck, the cotton-tail
rabbit, the Virginia opossum, and the flying squirrel.

BOTANY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

An examination of the flora has been made by Mr. W. Hunter, an employé of the
Park and a competent botanist, who received advice and assistance from Prof. Lester
F. Ward and Prof. W. H. Knowlton. The list of plants is necessarily incomplete,
owing to the fact that the observations did not commence until late in the season.
Excluding the trees a list of which has already been given, the following were noted:

GEOLOGY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK,

A special report upon the geology of the Park has been kindly furnished by Mr.
W.J. McGee, geologist to the Geological Survey.

“There is transmitted herewith a geologically colored map of the National Zoolog-
ical Park.

“Except that the prevailing rock formation is complex in structure and of age not
yet definitely determined, the geology of the Park is exceedingly simple. The for-
mations are:

ReGen. .22c% cs sea = Sas eee eae e Bee eee Alluvium.
Pleistocene =. .28i ness ese eee Soe Bee eee Columbia loam and gravel.
Cretaceous: (7) 2s. eee ares Se eee eee ae Potomac gravel.
Piedmont gneiss.
Arelioan (2) 2. ascadese ot een oe eee eee Vein quartz.
Steatite.

“In addition to these well characterized formations there is a limited variety of
residna left on decomposition of rock in place, of torrential or overplacement depos-
its formed by wash adown slopes, ete.

“The recent alluvium is confined to the channel and flood plain of Rock Creek. It
consists of loam, sand, and gravel partly derived from the older formations within
the Park, but mainly brought in by Rock Creek from beyond the limits of that reser-
vation. These materials are sometimes irregularly stratified, but again assorted into
sheets, sand-banks, gravel-bars, and more extended stretches of loam. It should be
observed that the alluvium area, together with the channel meandering tnrough it,
are coterminous with the flood plain of Rock Creek, and hence are subject to over-
flow during great freshets.

“The Columbia formation is a deposit of loam, gravel, bowlders, etc., formed dur-
ing the first ice invasion of the glacial period. Its age is therefore early Pleistocene.
About rivers the formation commonly consists of two members, the upper a homoge-
neous loam commonly red or brown in color, and the lower a bed of sand, gravel,
cobble-stones, and bowlders commonly stained brown by ferric oxide, sometimes
stratified, and here and there displaying a peculiar black stain which is mainly fer-
ruginous, but has been found to contain a trace of cobalt. Along the rivers of the
Middle Atlantic slope the formation is sometimes fashioned into terraces; and some
of its best developments in the District of Columbia (from which the name is taken)
are terraciform. In the Park the deposit displays the usual division into a superior
loam and an inferior bed of coarse materials; and the usual topographic form is as-
sumed since the deposit is practically confined to the pine-clad terrace or bench north
and west of Rock Creek, in the central part of the reservation. The formation is in-
deed confined to these terraces, save that an ill-defined and perhaps scarcely continu-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fu:

ous spur extends into the little valley of the branch that forms the principal affluent
of Rock Creek, and that another spur (from which the loam has been washed, lay-
ing bare the coarse materials of the inferior member) extends southeastward beyond
the terrace-scarp toward the upper angle in the course of Rock Creek. The red loam.
of the upper member was derived mainly from the Piedmont gneiss of the upper
reaches of Rock Creek ; while the lower member consists of sand and some loam from
the same source, well-rounded pebbles and cobble-stones from the Potomac formation,
angular or slightly water-worn fragments of quartz from the veins of that material
cutting the gneiss both within the Park and beyond its limits, bowlders of gneiss, ete.

“The Potomac formation is a series of sands, clays, ana gravels extending from the
Roanoke to the Delaware, but best developed along the Potomac River,in honor of
which the formation was christened. The age, determined through paleo-botany by
Professor Fontaine, is early Cretaceous; determined from vertebrate paleontology by
Professor Marsh, is Jurassic; and as determined by physical geology the formation
represents the beginning of the Cretaceous. Along its westernmost margin the
formation is usually represented by outlying patches of gravel commonly crowning
eminences; and this is the character displayed in the Park. Five small areas only
occur in the reservation: There is a remnant retaining the original structure crown-
ing the second greatest eminence in the northwestern part; there are two small rem-
nants, one certainly displaying the original structure upon the eminence occupied by
the Holt mansion in the southeastern corner of the reservation; there is a fourth
remnant, which may be in place, but is probably a residuum let down and disturbed by
the decay of the subjacent gneiss, mid-length of the southwestern boundary; and
there is another small area, which is certainly residual in the northeastern portion.
These remnants and others of like character beyond the limits of the Park are of
especial interest in that their cobble-stones were extensively used by aboriginal men
for the manufacture of rude implements. Modern man also utilizes the cobble-stones
extensively for road-making and other purposes.

‘‘The Piedmont gneiss is a vast complex of crystalline rocks extending from Ala-
bamato New Jersey. Many rock varieties are recognized within the complex; but
they have not yet been systematically differentiated throughout any considerable
part of the terrane. Within the Park the prevailing rocks are schists varying in
composition from place to place, and varying also in dip and strike. In general the
dip is high, sometimes nearly vertical, and the prevailing strike is northerly and
southerly. The gneissis the prevailing formation of the Park. It is overlain in part
by alluvium and by the Columbia formation, as well as by the isolated remnants of
the Potomac formation; and elsewhere it has been decomposed to a considerable
depth so that it is concealed by a mantle of materials derived from its own destruction
either in place or carried down slopes by gravity and the wash of storm waters. This
mantle of decomposed rock may be 20, 50, or even more feet in thickness, and proba-
bly averages no less than 15 or 20 feet over the entire reservation. So profound has
been this decomposition of the crystalline rocks that exposures occur only in the
steeper bluffs where Rock Creek has corroded rapidly during the later Neocene, Pleis-
tocene, and recent times. |The rocks of the Piedmont belt are seldom sufficiently
firm, tough, and durable to yield valuable building stones, and within the Park they
give little promise in this direction. At three points only is the promise even fair:
In the extreme northwestern corner of the reservation, toward the northern end of
the old quarry mid-length of the eastern side, and in the old quarry opposite Adams’s
Mill.

‘Within the Park, as beyond its limits, the Piedmont gneisses are frequently inter-
sected by veins of quartz. These range from sheets but a fraction of an inch thick
to great masses many yards across. Some of the more conspicuous examples have
been mapped. No law governing the trend or inclination of these veins is indicated
by these exposures, and no such law has thus far been formulated; but although the
relation of the quartz veins to the gueisses is not apparent, there is an obvious rela-
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tion between these obdurate rock masses and the topography. Many of them appear
in eminences or in the extremities of salients jutting streamward from the general
upland; and eyen where they have not been observed their existence may be sus-
pected in all the more sharply-cut salients.

‘The Piedmont gneiss varies from place to place in mineral composition as well as
in structure, and now and then sheets or masses of steatite—the soapstone of the
aborigines and early white settlers—may be found. This is true within the Park as
well as beyond its limits, and at two points quarries have been opened for the extrac-
tion of these materials for industrial purposes.

‘The topographic configuration of the Park is well shown upon the map. The grace-
fully curved hills and steep ravines characteristic of the country about the National
Capital here represent the work of Rock Creek during ages of erosion, and from hills,
valleys, and ravines the systematic geologist reads a record of erosion upon lines
first determined by rock structure, afterward modified by the superposition of an ex-
tensive formation—the Potomac—and finally developed under the influence of these
conditions affected albeit by the structure of the rocks reached by the stream in the
latter stages of its cutting. It is by reason of the varied conditions represented in
this complicated history that, while the configuration is commonly adjusted to the
hard quartz veins, there are cases in which quartz and topography are manifestly
independent in their distribution.

“The Park is watered as well as drained by Rock Creek and a few spring-born
streamlets. Within the reservation there are two walled springs, two others that
have received some attention, and a number of minor seeps; but the yield of these
springs is trifling, nove now giving permanent streams and all threatening to diminish
as the surface is further deforested or trampled. Wells of small vield may doubtless
be found by excavating in nearly any part of the Park; but the Potomac and Colum-
bia areas are too small to atford reservoirs; the dips of gneiss are too steep to give
strong subterranean streams, and the structure of the prevailing formation is too
complex to permit determination of such small subterranean water-ways as may
exist; moreover, wells east of Rock Creek will inevitably be contaminated within a
few years, if not at present, in consequence of the recent spread of population over
the adjacent uplands; and there is prospective danger of like contamination west ot
the water-way. Accordingly the Park must look either to Rock Creek or beyond its
own limits for permanent water supply.”

Unmistakable signs of Indian occupation have been found. Professor Holmes,
the archeologist of the Geological Survey, made a careful examination of the bowlder-
beds of the Potomac formation, and found many chipped implements, showing that
here, as elsewhere in the Rock Creek region the quartzite pebbles are shaped into
weapons. While most of those found were the imperfectly formed and rejected
stones, some portions of finished blades were discovered. It is not improbable that
an Indian village once existed within the Park limits, near the soapstone quarry on
the eastern side of the creek.

At the close of the fiscal year, the development and adaptation of this beautiful
region to the purposes of a zoological park were already commenced ; competent
professional advice was procured, and plans were under consideration for accommo-
dating the animals now in the collection and those that will shortly be Added.

APPENDIX VI.

REPORT ON PROFESSOR MORLEYS RESEARCHES.

WASHINGTON, January 17, 1891.
Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,

DEAR Sir: The accompanying letter from Prof. A. A. Michelson I can gladly in-
dorse in every particular. Iam familiar with Professor Morley’s work, having fol-
lowed it from the start, and I know it to be the best work of its kind in the history
of science. A part of it involves a re-determination of certain physical constants of
oxygen and hydrogen; and on this side of the question the classical researches of
Regnault are far excelled by the investigations so far made by Morley. Hitherto (for
a period of 3 or 4 years), the experiments have been carried on by Professor Morley at
his own personal expense, without aid from any institution. Such a burden no
private individual should be compelled to bear; and I feel sure that aid given by the
Smithsonian Institution will redound to its credit, and in the most direct manner tend
to fulfill the intention of its founder, himself a chemist.

The work upon which Professor Morley is engaged is, from a chemical stand-point,
fundamental in its character, and it has both a theoretical and a practical hearing.
All of the calculations upon which accurate chemical analyses depend rest upon our
knowledge of the atomie weights; and the ratio between oxygen and hydrogen is the
corner-stone of the entire system. It is both the most important and the most diffi-
- cult to measure of all the atomic weight ratios, and it directly affects nearly every
other value in the whole series of constants. Furthermore, all the physical properties
of the atoms are now believed to be functions of their mass, and thisidea is dominant
in the periodic law of Méndelejeff. That law shows the elements to be not independ-
ent of each other, but closely related ; so that the exact measurement of their atomic
weights bears directly upon the problem of the ultimate constitution of matter. If
all matter is one entity, then the weights of the different so-called ‘‘elementary ”
atoms should be connected by some definite mathematical law; and such a law can
only be developed upon the basis of the most refined experimental researches. In
the measurement of atomic weights ‘‘ accidental errors,” which practically vanish
from averages, do little harm; but the ‘‘ constant errors” are troublesome and all-
pervasive. Furthermore, since one atomic weight serves as the starting point for the
determination of others, the constant errors become cumulative, and their elimina-
tion is anything but easy.

In Morley’s determinations of the atomic weight of oxygen, the errors are controlled
by exact manipulation on the one hand, and by wide variations of method on the
other. If six or seven distinct methods of measurement, involving different possibili-
ties of error, give at last the same value sought, then the presumption is that constant
errors have been eliminated altogether. Up to the present date Professor Morley has
investigated the preparation of oxygen and hydrogen in absolute purity, the influence
of impurities in known amounts, the composition of water by volume, and the rela-
tive densities of the two gases. The series of experiments upon the composition of
water by volume have already been made public, and the results obtained are accurate
for a single experiment, to within one part in 26,000. Such accuracy was never before

83
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

approached, even remotely, in investigations of this kind. He now has in view the
synthesis of water by several distinct quantitative processes, and these involve large
weighings. For example, hydrogen is so light that large bulks must be taken in
order that the errors of weighing may not exercise an appreciable influence. In order
to do this, glass globes holding 20 litres are used; and their weight is considerable.
The ordinary analytical balances, ranging from 200 to 1.0000 grammes, are wholly
unavailable for the purpose, and hence an exceptional balance, such as Riiprecht has
made for the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Paris, becomes neces-
sary. In the office of onrown Coast and Geodetic Survey there is a balance approach-
ing these in character; so sensitive as to show the difference between two standard
kilogrammes placed side by side or one on top of the other. This difference in posi-
tion of two weights is a difference of distance from the center of the earth of a few
centimetres only, and yet it corresponds to a difference in weight of about .000015
gramme. This difference, according to Professor Mendenhall, is perfectly appreci-
able with the balances now in use. I can not say whether or not Riiprecht keeps
these finer balances in stock, but I suspect that one would have to be built to order,
so that some months would elapse before it could be delivered. The cost should not
exceed $500, and the balance, after serving Professor Morley’s purpose, might be
returned to the Institution, where it would have permanent value. The present
investigation could thus be assisted with little or no actual sinking of capital, and
the aid to research would continue long after the single investigation of Professor
Morley was finished. I sincerely hope that the assistance sought may be given.

Very respectfully,
F. W. CLARKE.

REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ORIENTALISTS.

Prof. S. P. LANGLEY,
Washington, D. C.:

Sir: In accordance with your instruction I attended the Eighth International
Congress of Orientalists as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution. The meetings of
the congress were held in Stockholm and Christiania, under the auspices of His
Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway, from September 1 to September 12, 1889.
The members assembled in Stockholm on September 1 and adjourned on September
7 to meet in Christiania from September 8 to September 11. September 12 was spent
in Géotheburg, where a farewell reception was given.

Five general meetings were held and the various sections met daily for the trans-
action of business.

There were registered as subscribers to the congress 710 names (204 Scandinavians
and 506 foreigners); more than one-half of the (286) foreign members were present.
The foreign members came from twenty-eight different countries, as indicated in the
tollowing table:

*In the London Academy of November 1, 1890, it is stated that the congress was
attended by 459 Europeans, 16 Americans, 13 Asiatic, and 5 African scholars. ‘This
calculation is evidently based on the supposition that the Swedish and Norwegian
subscribers were all present.

Comparing these figures with those of the preceding Oriental congresses it would
seem that there is an increase of devotion to Oriental studies among European schol-
ars. At the Seventh Congress, held at Vienna in 1886, there were 414 subscribers
and 228 members present; at the Sixth Congress, held at Leyden in 1883, there were
453 subscribers and 219 members present; at the Fifth Congress, held at Berlin in
1881, there were 296 subscribers and 189 members present.

The following table indicates the number of subseribers and members present at
each of the eight international congresses of Orientalists :

This marked inerease was no doubt chiefly due to the circulation of a special
American edition of the programme for the Stockholm Congress, published by the
Smithsonian Institution at the request of the secretary-general of the congress,
Count Landberg. This circular contained a revised English translation of the original
programme including additions and corrections especially furnished for this purpose
by the secretary-general of the congress. Copies of this circular were sent to all the
members of the American Oriental Society as well as to a great many libraries and
colleges in this country.

But three American institutions were represented by delegates: Brown University,
Providence, Rhode island, by Prof. Alonzo Williams, and the Smithsonian Institution
and the Johns Hopkins University by Prof. Paul Haupt.

It is to be regretted that the American Oriental Society did not sent a delegate to
the congress. The sending of a representative and the presentation of a complete set
of the journal ot the American Oriental Society to the honorary president of the con-
gress would have been appreciated. There was no delegate of the United States
Government, nor had England, Germany, or Prussia responded to the invitation to
send governmental delegates. The following countries sent such delegates,

Austria, Coburg-Gotha, Italy, Russia,
Baden, Denmark, Japan, Roumania,
Bavaria, Egypt, Netherlands, Saxony,
Bosnia, France, Persia, Siam,
Brazil, India, Portugal, Turkey.
The foilowing universities were represented :

Bombay, Giessen, Kasan, Petersburg,
Brown, Greifswald, London, Prague,
Cambridge, Halle, Rund, Rome,
Copenhagen, Helsingfors. Munich, Upsala,
Edinburgh, Johns Hopkins, Oxford, Vienna.

‘I may be allowed to mention especially Charles A. Briggs, D. C. Gilman, Profes-
sor Henry, Professor Salisbury, A. Van Name, Andrew D. White, W. D. Whitney;
the American Oriental Society, the Philosophical Society, of Hartford, Connecticut ;
the Smithsonian Institution. The late Dr. Schliemann, too, is registered as one of
the American subscribers.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89

Among the learned societies and institutions represented by delegates may be men-
tioned the Royal Asiatic Society, the Society of Biblical Archeology, the Palestine
Exploration Fund, the India Office of London, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the
Société Asiatique of Paris, the German Oriental Society, the Vatican Library, the
Royal Academies of Rome, Turin, Munich, Pesth, ete.

In accordance with the statement in the programme that the patron and honorary
president of the congress would be pleased to accept such works as would be depos-
ited for presentation to His Majesty, scholars and institutions all over the world
offered more than 3,000 valuable works and serials covering the entire range of orien-
tal studies.

The following works were presented by American institutions and scholars:

1. American Mission Press and American Bible Society, Beirut, Syria. About 50
Arabic publications. (See Liste des auvrages offerts, p. 19.)

2. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.

a. The American Journal of Philology, volumes I-1x, Baltimore, 1878-89.

b. Johns Hopkins University Circulars, volumes I-vi11, Baltimore, 1872-89.

c. The Williams Manuscript. Reprodtction in phototype of 17 pages of a Syriac
MS. containing the Epistles known as ‘‘ Antilegomena,” Baltimore, 1856.

d. Contributions to Assyriology and Comparative Semitic Philology, edited by
Friedrich Delitzsch and Paul Haupt, with the codperation of the Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, Maryland, volume 1, part 1, Leipsic, 1889.

3. The Smithsonian Institution on behalf of the U. 8S. National Museum:

Assyrian and Babylonian seals, facsimiles and flat impressions, illustrating the
method after which the smaller Assyro-Babylonian objects preserved in private Amer-
ican collections are reproduced for the study collection at the U.S. National Mu-
seul.

Owing to a mistake of the European Express Company the box containing these
objects did not arrive in time to be presented to the king at the general meeting of
the congress in Stockholm. At the request of the Smithsonian delegate the United
States minister to Sweden and Norway, Gen. W. W. Thomas, submitted the presents
to King Oscar at a special audience. The expression of interest by the king on that
occasion was conveyed in a letter of General Thomas herewith subjoined :

UNITED STATES LEGATION,

Stockholm, November 12, 1889.
Prof. PAUL HAuPt:

My Dear Sir: Your note from on board the steamer was duly received, and some
time after the box came to hand.

I might at once have sent the box through the usual official channels to the king,
but on opening it I found its contents of such valne, and so neatly and orderly ar-
ranged and classified that I desired to make sure that His Majesty should see this
model gift of the Smithsonian. |

The opportunity desired has occurred.

I to-day had an audience of the King. .

I took the box with me and had it carried into the audience chamber. In the ante
room I unpacked and took out the inner box, and also unpacked some of the little
boxes and the ancient seals contained therein. His Majesty himself took up the fine
inner box or tray, containing all the small boxes, placed it on his writing desk, read
the large general inscription in gold Jetters on black ground, and examined carefully
several of the Assyrian seals and casts, and expressed his admiration at the beauty and
clearness of the seals and the skill and method of the arrangement.

The King said he should take time at his leisure to look over the seals more thor-
oughly, and would then decide where to place the tray. His Majesty also desired me
to express his thanks to the Smithsonian Institution for this beautiful and useful gift-
as well as his appreciation of the method and skill displayed in the cases and general
arrangement.
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congratulating the Smithsonian and yourself, not only upon this present and its
gracious reception, but upon the general exhibit made by the United States at the
Oriental Congress at Stockholm in seals and books, and last and best, in men,

I remain, my dear sir, yours very sincerely,
W. W. THoMAS, JR.

meeting was opened in the name of the King by the minister of public instruction. The
King had offered two prizes (by special decree of January 6, 1886), one for a work on
the History of the Semitic Languages, and the other on the Civilization of the Arab
Muhammed. No works of European or American Orientalists were submitted to the
special committee appointed for the purpose ef reporting the recommendation for the
award of the prizes. But six Arabic workson the second-named subject by Oriental
authors had beer sent to the committee, and one of these Oriental scholars, Mahmud
Shookree el-Aloasee of Baghdad, though not coming up fully to the requirements,
was considered worthy of King Oscar’s gold medal for art aud science, with the rib-
bon of the order of Wasa.

Quite a number of native scholars from the East were present and took an active
part in the proceedings.

Abdallah Fikri Pasha spoke on the Divan of Hasan Ibn Thabit.

Sheikh Hamza Fathallah: On the right of women in the Islam.

Mahmud Omar: On Arabic proverbs in Egypt.

Emin Bey Fikri: Against those who prefer modern Arabic to the classical language.

These three papers were in Arabic, the following native Oriental scholars spoke in
English:

Jivanji Jamshedji Modi: On the position of the Haoma in the Avesta of the Parsecs.

In his opening address the secretary-general called attention to this special feature
of the congress, and expressed the hope that this active participation on the part of
native Oriental scholars would be the starting point of a new era for the civilization
of the East.

A great many of the most distinguished Orientalists from all parts of the globe were
present, among them may be mentioned: Brugsch, Biihler, Chwolson, Dillmann,
Euting, Giusburg, de Goeje, Donner, Gubernatis, Guidi, Halévy, Kern, Kremer,
Mehren, Max Miiller, Oppert, Reinisch, de Rosny, Rost, Sayce, Schefer, Schlegel,
J. Schmidt, Spiegel, Weber.

Over a hundred papers of great value were read:

Twenty-four in the Semitic section Ia (Arabic and Islam).

Twenty-six in T section Ib (cuneiform research, etc).

Twenty-two in section II (Aryan).

Nineteen in section III (Egyptian, etc.).

The following papers were read by American Orientalists:

a. Prof. Paul Haupt, The Death of Sargon IT.

b. Prof. Henry Hyvernat, the palzographical introduction to his Acts of the
Martyrs in Egypt.

ce Chas. G. Leland: The Pidjin (Chinese-English) dialect and its relation to
other mixed dialects, followed by a communication on the dissidence of the Chi-
nese philosophers concerning the question of human nature.

The scientific character of the meeting, however, was somewhat impaired by the
almost excessive hospitality of the Scandinavian hosts, and especially by the number
of tourists who attracted by the programme attended. It looked occasionally as
though the Congress were rather a succession of festivities than a serious gathering
of scholars for scientific purposes. It was especially regretted that there was hardly
any time for private intercourse between individual fellow-workers. Since the meet-
ing of the Congress some feeling has developed against so great a display of hospi-
tality in the future.

Where the next International Congress of Orientalists is to meet has not yet been
determined.

At the general meeting of all the sections held at Stockholm on August 6, under
the presidency of King Oscar, it was suggested by the delegate of the Smithsonian
Institution (after a special meeting of all the American orientalists present, with the
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Awerican minister in the chair) that the Tenth Congress should be held in America in
1893. The idea seemed to meet with general approval, but it remains to be seen
whether the American orientalists will be ready to extend a formal invitation.

Professor Haupt addressed King Oscar at this occasion as follows:

‘‘T have the honor to present to your majesty the first part of a new publication
which is intended to contribute, above all, to the solution of the problem set by your
majesty, viz, the history of the Semitic languages. The series is entitled Contri-
butions to Assyriology and Comparative Semitic Philology. I submit the first part
on behalf of the Johns Hopkins University, of Baltimore, with whose co-operation the
work is published. I beg leave to add some other publications issued under the au-
spices of the Johns Hopkins University.

“1, The photo lithographic re-production of 17 pages of a Syriac MS.

‘©9. A complete series of the Johns Hopkins University circulars, which report on
the development of this new university since the year 1879 and which contain at
the same time numerous contributions to Oriental research.

‘©3, The 9 volumes of the American Journal of Philology (published at Baltimore
under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins University) which contain several impor-
tant articles of our venerable leader in Oriental philology, Professor Whitney, as well
as papers by other American orientalists, both Indo-European and Semitic.

“ T am also instructed as delegate of the Smithsonian Institution to present to your
majesty on behalf of the U. 8S. National Museum a number of Babylonian and As-
syrian seals (facsimiles and flat impressions) illustrating the methods after which
smaller Assyrian and Babylonian objects preserved in private American collections
are reproduced for the study collection of the U. 8. National Museum.

“Your majesty will see what interest is had in America in Oriental studies, espe-
cially in cuneiform research. There are more instructors in Assyriology now in the
United States than at all the European universities combined. Also at this con-
gress there are nearly forty American orientalists inscribed as members.

‘7, Lean not suppress the hope that our European follow-workersin view of the pro-
gress of Oriental studies in America will be willing before long to have, perhaps, the
Tenth International Congress of Orientalists meet in the United States. The dis-
tance will hardly deter many. It will, perhaps, be possible to place at the disposal of
the members a steamer which would carry them to America and back again to
Europe. Nor would the attendance at the Congress take much time. Even in case
there should be 6 days in Washington (or wherever we should agree to meet), followed
by an excursion to the West, Chicago, the Lake region, Niagara Falls, and thence,
again, through Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to Washington, it
would be possible to do all that (including the passage across the Atlantic both ways)
in a little more than one month. The gracious interest which your majesty has
devoted to Oriental studies will always exercise an encouraging influence, and I
trust that at the meeting of the Congress on American soil we shall not be too far
behind the older Enropean centers of Oriental learning.”

Respectfully submitted.
PAUL HAvptT.
GENERAL APPENDIX

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1890.

93
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; occasional reports of the investigations
made by collaborators of the Institution; memoirs of a general charac-
ter or on special topics, whether original and prepared expressly for the
purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceedings; and briefly
to present (as fally as space will permit) such papers not published in
the Smithsonian Contributions or in the Miscellaneous Collections as
may be supposed to be of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more reimarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, been
carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would possess
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the dis-continuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthropol-
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfac-
factorily, down to and including the year 1888,

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1899.

THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROBLEM FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
TO THE PRESENT DAY.*

By HERMANN SCHUBERT.

I.—UNIVERSAL INTEREST IN THE PROBLEM.

For two and a half thousand years both trained and untrained minds
have striven in vain tosolve the problem known as the squaring of the
circle. Now that geometers have at last succeeded in giving a rigid
demonstration of the impossibility of solving the problem with ruler
and compasses, it seems fitting and opportune to cast a glance into the
nature and history of this very ancient problem. And this will be
found all the more justifiable in view of the fact that the squaring of
the circle, at least in name, is very widely known outside of the narrow
limits of professional mathematicians.

The resolution of the French Academy.—The Proceedings of the French
Academy for the year 1775 contain, at page 61, the resolution of the
Academy not to examine, from that time on, any so-called solutions of
the quadrature of the circle that might be handed in. The Academy
was driven to this determination by the overwhelming multitude of pro-
fessed solutions of the famous problem, which were sent to it every
month in the year—solutions which, of course, were an invariable attes-
tation of the ignorance and self-consciousness of their authors, but
which suffered collectively from a very important error in mathematics :
they were wrong. Since that time all professed solutions of the problem
received by the Academy find a sure haven in the waste-basket, and re-
main unanswered for all time. The circle-squarer, however, sees in
this high-handed manner of rejection only the envy of the great towards
his grand intellectual discovery. He is determined to meet with recog-
nition, and appeals, therefore, to the public. The newspapers must
obtain for him the appreciation that scientific societies have denied.
And every year the old mathematical sea serpent more than once dis-
ports itself in the columns of our papers, that a Mr. N.N., of P. P., has
at last solved the problem of the quadrature of the circle.

98 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

General ignorance of quadrators.—But what kind of people are these
circle-squarers, wWhen-examined by the light? Almost always they will
be found to be imperfectly educated persons, whose mathematical know-
ledge does not exceed that of a modern college freshman. It is seldom
that they know accurately what the requirements of the problem are
and what its nature. They never know the two and a half thousand
years’ history of the problem, and they have no idea whatever of the
important investigations and results which have been made with ref-
erence to the problem by great and real mathematicians in every cen-
tury down to our time.

A cyclometric type—Yet great as is the quantum of ignorance that
circle-squarers intermix with their intellectual products, the lavish sup-
ply of conceit and self-consciousness with which they season their per-
formances is still greater. I have not far to go to furnish a verification
of this. A book printed in Hamburg in the year 1840 lies before me, in
which the author thanks Almighty God at every second page that He
has selected him and no one else to solve the “ problem phenomenal”
of mathematics, ** so long sought for, so fervently desired, and attempt-
ed by millions.” After the modest author has proclaimed himself the
unmasker of Archimedes’s deceit, he says: ‘It thus has pleased our
mother nature to withhold this mathematical jewel from the eye of bu-
man investigation until she thought it fitting to reveal truth to sim-
plicity.”

This will suffice to show the great self-consciousness of the author.
But it does not suffice to prove his ignorance. He has no conception of
mathematical demonstration; he takes it for granted that things are so
because they seem so to him. Errors of logic, also, are abundantly
found in his book. But apart from this general incorrectness, let us
see wherein the real gist of his fallacy consists. It requires consider-
able labor to find out what this is from the turgid language and bom-
bastie style in which the author has buried his conclusions. But it is
this: The author inscribes a square in a circle, cireumscribes another
about it, then points out that the inside square is made up of four con-
gruent triangles, whereas the circumscribed square is made up of eight
such triangles; from which fact, seeing that the circle is larger than
the one square and smaller than the other, he draws the bold conclusion
that the circle is equal in area to six such triangles. It is hardly con-
ceivable that a rational being could infer that something which is
greater than 4 and less than 8 must necessarily be 6. But with a man
that attempts the squaring of the circle this kind of ratiocination ts
possible.

Similarly in the case of all other attempted solutions of the problem,
either logical fallacies or violations of elementary arithmetical or geo-
metrical truths may be pointed out. Only they are not always of
such a trivial nature as in the book just mentioned.

Let us now inquire whence the inclination arises which leads people
to take up the quadrature of the circle and to attempt to solve it.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 99

The allurements of the problem.—Attention must first be called to
the antiquity of the problem. A quadrature was.attempted in Egypt
500 years before the exodus of the Israelites. Among the Greeks the
problem never ceased to play a part that greatly influenced the pro-
gress of mathematics. And in the middle agesalso the squaring of the
circle sporadically appears as the philosopher’s stone of mathematics.
The problem has thus never ceased to be dealt with and considered.
But it is not by the antiquity of the problem that circle-squarers are
enticed, but by the allurement which everything exerts that is caleu-
lated to raise the individual out of the mass of ordinary humanity, and
to bind about his temples the laurel crown of celebrity. It is ambition
that spurred men on in ancient Greece and still spurs them on in mod-
ern times to crack this primeval mathematical nut. Whether they are
competent thereto is a secondary consideration. They look upon the
squaring of the circle as the grand prize of a lottery that can just as
well fall to their lot as to that of any other. They do not remember
that—

Toil before honor is placed by sagacious decrees of Immortals,

and that it requires years of continued studies to gain possession of the
mathematical weapons that are indispensably necessary to attack the
problem, but which even in the hands of the most distinguished math-
ematical strategists have not sufficed to take the stronghold.

About the only problem known to the lay world.—But how is it, we
must further ask, that it happens to be the squaring of the circle and
not some other unsolved mathematical problem upon which the efforts
of people are bestowed who have no knowledge of mathematics yet
busy themselves with mathematical questions? The question is
answered by the fact that the squaring of the circle is about the only
mathematical problem that is known to the unprofessional world—at
least by name. Even among the Greeks the problem was very widely
known outside of mathematical circles. In the eyes of the Grecian
layman, as at present among many of his modern brethren, occupation
with this problem was regarded as the most important and essential
business of mathematicians. In fact they had a special word to desig-
nate this species of activity, namely, cerpayw»ifew, which means to
busy one’s self with the quadrature. In modern times, also, every ed-
ucated person, though he be not a mathematician, knows the problem
by name, and knows that it is insolvable, or at least, that despite the
efforts of the most famous mathematicians it has not yet been solved.
For this reason the phrase “to square the circle,” is now used in the
sense of attempting the impossible.

Belief that rewards have been offered.—But in addition to the antiquity
of the problem, and the fact also that it is known to the lay world, we
have yet a third factor to point out that induces people to take up with
it. This is the report that has been spread abroad for a hundred years
now, that the Academies, the Queen of England, or some other influen-
100 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE,

tial person, has offered a great prize to be given to the one that first
solves the problem. As a matter of fact we find the hope of obtaining
this large prize of money the principal incitement to action with many
circle-squarers. And the author of the book above referred to begs his
readers to lend him their assistance in obtaining the prizes offered.

The problem among mathematicians.—Although the opinion is widely
current in the unprofessional world that professional mathematicians
are still busied with the solution of the problem, this is by no means
the ease. On the contrary, for some two hundred years, the endeavors
of many considerable mathematicians have been solely directed towards
demonstrating with exactness that the problem is insolvable. It is, as
a rule—and naturally—more difficult to prove that something is impos-
sible than to prove that it is possible. And thus it has happened, that
up to within a few years ago, despite the employment of the most varied
and the most comprehensive methods of modern mathematics, no one
succeeded in supplying the wished-for demonstration of the problem’s
impossibility. At last, Professor Lindemann, of K6énigsberg, in June,
1882, succeeded in furnishing a demonstration—and the first demonstra-
tion—that it is impossible by the exclusive employment of ruler and
compasses to construct a square that is mathematically exactly equal
in area toa given circle. The demonstration, naturally, was not effected
with the help of the old elementary methods; for if it were, it would
surely have beemaccomplished centuries ago; but methods were requis-
ite that were first furnished by the theory of definite integrals and de-
partments of higher algebra developed in the last decades ; in other
words, it required the direct and indirect preparatory labor of many
centuries to make finally possible a demonstration of the insolvability
of this historic problem.

Of course, this demonstration will have no more effect than the reso-
lution of the Paris Academy of 1775 in causing the fecund race of
circle-squarers to vanish from the face of the earth. In the future as
in the past, there will be people who know nothing and will not want
to know anything of this demonstration, and who believe that they
can not help but succeed in a matter in which others have failed, and
that just they have been appointed by Providence to solve the famous
puzzle. But unfortunately the ineradicable passion of wanting to
solve the quadrature of the circle has also its serious side. Circle-
squarers are not always so self-contented as the author of the book we
have mentioned. They often see or at least divine the insuperable
difficulties that tower up before them, and the conflict between their
aspirations and their performances, the consciousness that they want
to solve the problem but are unable to solve it, darkens their soul and,
lost to the world, they become interesting subjects for the science of
psychiatry.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 101
II.—_NATURE OF THE PROBLEM.

Numerical rectification.—If we have a circle before us, it is easy for us
to determine the length of its radius or of its diameter, which must be
donble that of the radius; and the question next arises to find the num-
ber that represents how many times larger its circumference, that is the
length of the circular line, is than its radius or its diameter. From the
fact that all circles have the same shape it follows that this proportion
will always be the same for both iarge and small circles. Now, since
the time of Archimedes, all civilized nations that have cultivated math-
ematics have called the number that denotes how many times larger
than the diameter the circumference of a circle is, z—the Greek initial
letter of the word periphery. To compute z, therefore, means to caleu-
late how many times larger the circumference of a circle is than its
diameter. This calculation is called ‘‘the numerical rectification of the
circle.”

The numerical quadrature.—Next to the calculation of the circumfer-
ence, the calculation of the superficial contents of a circle by means of
its radius or diameter is perhaps most important; that is, the computa-
tion of how much area that part of a plane which lies within a circle
measures. This calculation is called the “numerical quadrature.” It
depends, however, upon the problem of numerical rectification; that is,
upon the calculation of the magnitude of z. For it is demonstrated in
elementary geometry that the area of a circle is equal to the area of a
triangle produced by drawing in the circle a radius, erecting at the ex-
tremity of the same a tangent—that is, in this case a perpendicular—
cutting off upon the latter the length of the circumference, measuring
from the extremity, and joining the point thus obtained with the center
of the circle. But it follows from this that the area of a circle is as
many times larger than the square upon its radius as the number z
amounts to.

Constructive rectification and quadrature.—The numerical rectification
and numerical quadrature of the circle based upon the computation of
the number z are to be clearly distinguished from problems that require
a Straightline equal in length to'the circumference of a circle, or a square
equal in area to a circle, to be constructively produced out of its radius
or its diameter; problems which might properly be called “ constructive
rectification” or ‘constructive quadrature.” Approximately, of course,
by employing an approximate value for z these problems are easily
solvable. But to solve a problem of construction, in geometry, means
to solve it with mathematical exactitude. If the value < were exactly
equal to the ratio of two whole numbers to one another, the constructive
rectification would present no difficulties. For example, suppose the
circumference of a circle were exactly 31 times greater than its diam-
eter; then the diameter could be divided into seven equal parts, which
could be easily done by the principles of planimetry with ruler and
102 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

compasses, then we would produce to the amount of such a part a
straight line exactly three times larger than the diameter, and should
thus obtain a straight line exactly equal to the circumference of the
circle. But asa matter of facet, and as has actually been demonstrated,
there do not exist two whole pumbers, be they ever so great, that exactly
represent by their proportion to one another the number z. Conse-
quently, a rectification of the kind just described does not attain the
object desired.

It might be asked here, whether from the demonstrated fact that the
number z is not equal to the ratio of two whole numbers however great,
it does not immediately follow that it is impossible to construct a
straight line exactly equal in length to the circumference of a circle ;
thus demonstrating at once the impossibility of solving the problem.
This question is to be answered in the negative. For there are in
geometry many sets of two lines of which the one can be easily con-
structed from the other, notwithstanding the fact that no two whole
numbers can be found to represent the ratio of the twolines. Theside
and the diagonal of a square, for instance, are so constituted. It is
true the ratio of the latter two magnitudes is nearly that of 5 to 7.
But this proportion is not exact, and there are in fact no two numbers
that represent the ratio exactly. Nevertheless, either of these two
lines can be easily constructed from the other by the sole employment of
ruler and compasses. This might be the case, too, with the rectifica-
tion of the circle; and consequently from the impossibility of represent-
ing z by the ratio between two whole numbers the impossibility of the
problem of rectification is not inferable.

The quadrature of the circle stands and falls with the problem of
rectification. This is based upon the truth above mentioned, that a cir-
cle is equal in area to a right-angle triangle, in which one side is equal
to the radius of the circle and the other to the circumference. Sup-
posing, accordingly, that the circumference of the circle were rectified,
then we could construct this triangle. But every triangle, as is taught
in the elements of planimetry, can, with the help of ruler and com-
passes, be converted into a square exactly equal toit in area. So that,
therefore, supposing the rectification of the circumference of a circle
were successfully performed, a square could be constructed that would
be exactly equal in area to the circle.

The dependence upon one another of the three problems of the com-
putation of the number z, of the quadrature of the circle, and its recti-
fication, thus obliges us, in dealing with the history of the quadrature,
to regard investigations with respect to the value of z, and attempts to
rectify the circle as of equal importance, and to consider them accord-
ingly.

Conditions of the geometrical solution—We have used repeatedly in
the course of the discussion the expression *‘ to construct with ruler and
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 103

compasses.” It will be necessary to explain what is meant by the speci-
fication of these two instruments. When such a number of conditions
is annexed to a requirement in geometry to construct a certain figure
that the construction only of one figure or a limited number of figures
is possible in accordance with the conditions given, such a complete
requirement is called a problem of construction, or briefly a problem.
When a problem of this kind is presented for solution it is necessary to
reduce it to simpler problems, already recognized as solvable ; and since
these latter depend in their turn upon other still simpler problems, we
are finally brought back to certain fundamental problems, upon which
the rest are based but which are not themselves reducible to problems
less simple. These fundamental problems are, so to speak, the under-
most stones of the edifice of geometrical construction. The question
next arises as to what problems may be properly regarded as funda-
mental; and it has been found that the solution of a great part of the
problems that arise in elementary planimetry rests upon the solution
of only five original problems. They are:

(1) The construction of a straight line which shall pass through two
given points.

(2) The construction of a circle the center of — is a given point
and the radius of which has a given length.

(3) The determination of the point that lies coincidently on two given
straight lines extended as far as is necessary—in case such a point
(point of intersection) exists.

(4) The determination of the two points that lie coincidently ona
given straight line and a given circle—in case such common points
(points of intersection) exist.

(5) The determination of the two points that lie coincidently on two
given circles—in case such common points (points of intersection) exist.

For the solution of the three last of these five problems the eye alone
is needed, while for the solution of the two first problems, besides pen-
cil, ink, chalk, and the like, additional special instruments are required :
for the solution of the first problem a ruler is most generally used, and
for the solution of the second a pair of compasses. But it must be re-
membered that it is no concern of geometry what mechanical instru-
ments are employed in the solution of the five problems mentioned.
Geometry simply limits itself to the pre-supposition that these problems
are solvable and regards a complicated problem as solved if, upon a
specification of the constructions of which the solution consists, no other
requirements are demanded than the five above mentioned. Since, ac-
cordingly, geometry does not itself furnish the solution of these five
problems, but rather exacts them, they are termed postulates.* All

* Usually geometers mention only two postulates (Nos.1 and 2). But since to ge-
ometry proper it is indifferent whether only the eye, or additional special mechani-
cal instruments are necessary, the author has regarded it more correct in point of
method to assume five postulates.
104 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

problems of planimetry are not reducible to these five problems alone,
There are problems that can be solved only by assuming other prob-
lems as solvable which are not included in the five given: for example,
the construction of an ellipse, having given its center and its major
and minor axes. Many problems, however, possess the property of be-
ing solvable with the assistance solely of the five postulates above for-
mulated, and where this is the case they are said to be “ constructible
with ruler and compasses,” or ‘‘elementarily” constructible.

After these general remarks upon the solvability of problems of geo-
metrical construction, which an understanding of the history of the
squaring of the circle makes indispensably nevessary, the significance
of the question whether the quadrature of the circle is or is not solva-
ble, that is, elementarily solvable, will become intelligible. But the
conception just discussed of elementary solvability only gradually took
clear form, and we therefore find among the Greeks as well as among
the Arabs, endeavors, successful in some respects, that aimed at solv-
ing the quadrature of the circle with other expedients than the five
postulates. We have also to take these endeavors into consideration,
and especially so as they, no less than the unsuccessful efforts at ele-
mentary solution, have upon the whole advanced the science of geome-
try and contributed much to the clarification of geometrical ideas.

Ill.—HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS.

The Egyptian Quadrature.—In the oldest mathematical work that we
possess we find a rule that tells us how to make a square which is equal
in area to a given cirele. This celebrated book, the Papyrus Rhind of
the British Museum, translated and explained by Eisenlohr (Leipsie,
1887), was written, asit is stated in the work, in the thirty-third year of
the reign of King Ra-a-us, by a scribe of that monarch, named Ahmes.
The composition of the work falls accordingly into the period of the two
Hiksos dynasties, that is, in the period between 2000 and 17008. c. But
there is another important circumstance attached to this. Ahmes men-
tions in his introduction that he composed his work after the model
of old treatises, written in the time of King Raenmat; whence it appears
that the originals of the mathematical expositions of Ahmes, are half
a thousand years older yet than the Papyrus Rhind.

The rule given in this papyrus for obtaining a square equal to a cir-
cle, specifies that the diameter of the circle shall be shortened one-
ninth of its length and upon the shortened line thus obtained a square
crected. Of course, the area of a square of this construction is only ap-
proximately equal to the area of the circle. An idea may be obtained
of the degree of exactness of this original, primitive quadrature by our
remarking that if the diameter of the circle in question is one metre
in length, the square that is supposed to be equal to the circle is a lit-
tle iess than half a square decimetre larger; an approximation not so
accurate as that computed by Archimedes, yet much more correct than
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 105

many 1 one later employed. It is not known how Ahmes or his pre-
decessors arrived at this approximate quadrature; but it is certain
that it was handed down in Egypt from century to century, and in late
Egyptian times it repeatedly appears.

The Biblical and Babylonian quadratures.—Besides among the Egyp-
tians we also findin pre-Grecian antiquity an attempt at circle-compu-
tation among the Babylonians. ‘This is not a quadrature; but aims at
the rectification of the circumference. The Bablyonian mathematicians
had discovered that if the radius of a circle be successively inscribed
as chord within its circumference, after the sixth inscription we arrive
at the point of departure, and they concluded from this that the circum-
ference of a circle must be a little larger than a line which is six times
as long as the radius, that is, three times as long as the diameter. A
trace of this Babylonian method of computation may even be found in
the Bible; for in 1 Kings vii, 23, and 11 Chron. iv, 2, the great laver is
described, which under the name of the ‘“‘molten sea” constituted an
ornament of the Temple of Solomon; and it is said of this vessel that it
measured 10 cubits from brim to brim, and 30 cubits roundabout. The
number 3 as the ratio between the circumference and the diameter is
still more plainly given in the Talmud, where we read that “ that which
measures three lengths in circumference is one length across.”

Among the Greeks. —With regard to the earlier Greek mathemati- .
cians—as Thales and Pythagoras—we know that they acquired the
foundations of their mathematical knowledge in Egypt. But nothing
has been handed down to us which shows that they knew of the old
Egyptian quadrature, or that they dealt with the problem at all. But
tradition says that subsequently the teacher of Euripides and Pericles,
the great philosopher and mathematician Anaxagoras, whom Plato
80 highly praised, ‘‘drew the quadrature of the circle” in prison, in the
year 434. This is the account of Plutarch in the seventeenth chapter
of his work “De Exilio.”

Anaxagoras.—The method is not told us in which Anaxagoras had.
supposably solved the problem, and it is not said whether knowingly
or unknowingly he accomplished an approximate solution after the
manner of Ahmes. But at any rate, to Anaxagoras belongs the merit
of having called attention to a problem that bore great fruit, in having
incited Grecian scholars to busy themselves with geometry, and thus
more and more to advance that science.

The quadratrix of Hippias of Elis —Again, it is reported that the
mathematician Hippias of Elis invented a curved line that could be
made to serve a double purpose; first, to trisect an angle, and, second,
to square thecirele. This curved line is the tetpaywyifovca so often men-
tioned by the later Greek mathematicians, and by the Romans, called
“quadratrix.” Regarding the nature of this curve we have exact knowl-
edge from Pappus. But it will be sufficient, here, to state that the
quadratrix is not acircle nor a portion of a circle, so that its construc-
106 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

tion is not possible by means of the postulates enumerated in the
preceding section. And therefore the solution of the quadrature of the
circle founded on the construction of the quadratriz is not an elementary
solution in the sense discussed in the last section. We can, it is true,
conceive a mechanism that will draw this curve as well as compasses
draw a circle; and with the assistance of a mechanism of this descrip-
tion the squaring of the circle is solvable with exactitude. But if it be
allowed toemploy in a solution an apparatus especially adapted thereto,
every problem may be said to be solvable. Strictly taken, the invention
of the curve of Hippias substitutes for one insuperable difficulty another
equally insuperable. Sometime afterwards, about the year 350, the
mathematician Dinostratus showed that the qguadratrix could also be
used to solve the problem of rectification, and from that time on this
problem plays almost the same role in Grecian mathematics as the
related problem of quadrature.

The Sophists’ solution.—As these problems gradually became known to
the non-mathematicians of Greece, attempts at solution at once sprang
up that are worthy of a place by the side of the solutions of modern ama-
teur circle-squarers. The Sophists, especially, believed themselves com-
petent by seductive dialectic to take a stronghold that had defied the
intellectual onslaughts of the greatest mathematicians. With verbal
nicety, amounting to puerility, it was said that the squaring of the circle
depended upon the finding of a number which represented in itself both
a square and acircle; a square by being a square number, a circle in
that it ended with the same number as the root number from which, by
multiplication with itself, it was produced. The number 36, accord-
ingly, was, as they thought, the one that embodied the solution of the
famous problem.

Jontrasted with this twisting of words the speculations of Bryson and
Antiphon, both contemporaries of Socrates, though inexact, appear in
high degree intelligent.

Antiphor’s attempt.—Antiphon divided the circle into four equal ares,
and by joining the points of division obtained a square; he then divided
each are again into two equal parts and thus obtained an inscribed octa-
gon; thence he constructed an inscribed dodecagon, and perceived that
the figure so inscribed more and more approached the shape of a circle.
In this way, he said, one should proceed, until there was inseribed in
the circle a polygon whose sides by reason of their smallness should
coincide with the circle. Now this polygon could, by methods already
taught by the Pythagoreans, be converted into a square of equa! area;
and upon the basis of this fact Antiphon regarded the squaring of the
circle as solved.

Nothing can be said against this method except that, however far
the bisection of the ares is carried, the result must still remain an ap-
proximate one.

Bryson of Heraklea.—The attempt of Bryson of Heraklea was better
still; for this scholar did not rest content with finding a square that was
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 107

very little smaller than the circle, but obtained by means of circumscribed
polygons another square that was very little larger tha. the circle. Only
Bryson committed the error of believing that the area of the circle was
the arithmeticai mean between an inscribed and a circumscribed polygon
of an equal number of sides. Notwithstanding this error, however, to
Bryson belongs the merit, first, of having introduced into mathematics
by his emphasis of the necessity of a square which was too large and
one which was too small, the conception of maximum and minimum
“limits” in approximations; and secondly, by his comparison with a
circle of the inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons, the merit of
having indicated to Archimedes the way by which an approximate
value for z was to be reached.

Hippocrates of Chios.—Not long after Antiphon and Bryson, Hippo-
crates of Chios treated the problem, which had now become more and
more famous, from a new point of view. Hippocrates was not satisfied
with approximate equalities, and searched for curvilinearly bounded
plane figures which should be mathematically equal to a rectilinearly
bounded figure, and therefore could be converted by ruler and compasses
into a square equalinarea. First, Hippocrates found that the erescent-
shaped plane figure produced by drawing two perpendicular radii in a
circle and describing upon the line joining their extremities a semicircle,
is exactly equal in area to the triangle that is formed by this line of
junction and the two radii; and upon the basis of this fact the endeavors
of the untiring scholar were directed towards converting a circle into a
crescent. Naturally he was unable to attain this object, but by his eftorts
to this end he discovered many a new geometrical truth; among others
the generalized form of the theorem mentioned, which bears to the pres-
ent day the name of Lunule Hippocratis, the lunes of Hippocrates.
Thus it appears, in the case of Hippocrates, in the plainest light, how
the very insolvable problems of science are qualified to advance science;
in that they incite investigators to devote themselves with persistence
to its study and thus to fathom its depths.

Euclid’s avoidance of the problem.—Following Hippocrates i in the his-
torical line of the great Grecian geometricians comes the systematist
Euclid, whose rigid formulation of geometrical principles has remained
the standard presentation down to the present century. The Elements
of Euclid, however, contain nothing relating to the quadrature of the
circle or to circle-computation. Comparisons of surfaces which relate
to the circle are indeed found in the book, but nowhere a computation
of the circumference of a circle or of the area of the circle. This pal-
pable gap in Euclid’s system was filled by Archimedes, the greatest
mathematician of antiquity.

Archimedes’s calculations —Achimedes was born in Syracuse in the
year 287 B. C., and devoted his life, there spent, to the mathematical and
- the physical sciences which he enriched with invaluable contributions.
He lived in Syracuse till the taking of the town by Marcellus, in the year
108 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE,

212 8. o. when he fell by the hand of a Roman soldier whom he had for-
bidden to destroy the figures he had drawn in thesand. To the greatest
performances of Archimedes the successful computation of the number z
unquestionably belong. Like Bryson he started with regular inseribed
and cireumscribed polygons. He showed how it was possible, begin-
ning with the perimeter of an inscribed hexagon, which is equal to six
radii, to obtain by way of calculation the perimeter of a regular dodec-
agon, and then the perimeter of a figure having double the number of
sides of the preceding one. Treating, then, the circumscribed polygons
in a similar manner, and proceeding with both series of polygons up to
a regular 96-sided polygon, he perceived on the one hand that the ratio
of the perimeter of the inscribed 96-sided polygon to the diameter was
greater than 6336: 20174, and on the other hand, that the correspond-
ing ratio with respect to the circumscribed 96-sided polygon was
smaller than 14688: 4673$. He inferred from this, that the number z,
the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, was greater than the
fraction .°39; and smaller than 14955. Reducing the two limits thus
found for the value of z, Archimedes then showed that the first frac-
tion was greater than 31%, and that the second fraction was smaller
than 31, whence it followed with certainty that the value sought for z
lay between 31 and 32%. The larger of these two approximate values
is the only one usually learned and employed. That which fills us
most with astonishment in the Archimedean computation of z, is, first,
the great acumen and accuracy displayed in all the details of the com-
putation, and then the unwearied perserverance that he must have
exercised in calculating the limits of = without the advantages of the
Arabian system of numerals and of the decimal notation. For it must
be considered that at many stages of the computation what we call the
extraction of roots was necessary, and that Archimedes could only by
extremely tedious calculations obtain ratios that expressed approxi-
mately the roots of given numbers and fractions.

The later mathematicians of Greece.—With regard to the mathemati-
cians of Greece that follow Archimedes, all refer to and employ the
approximate value of 34 for z, without however contributing any-
thing essentially new or additional to the problems of quadrature
aud of eyclometry. Thus Heron of Alexandria, the father of sur-
veying, who flourished about the year 100 B. C., employs for pur-
poses of practical measurement sometimes the value 3} for z and
sometimes even the rougher approximation z=3. The astronomer
Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria about the year 150 A. D., and
who was famous as being the author of the planetary system univer-
sally recognized as correct down to the time of Copernicus, was the
only one who furnished a more exact value; this he designated, in the
sexigesimal system of fractional notation which he employed, by 3, 8,
30—that is 3 and ,§; and ;28,, or as we now say 3 degrees 8 minutes
(partes minute prime) and 30 seconds (partes minute secunde). As
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 109

a matter of fact, the expression 3 + &; + 73% = 3,44 represents the
number z more exactly than 3+; but on the other hand is, by reason of
the magnitude of the miners 17 and 120 as compared with the num-
bers 1 and 7, more cumbersome.

Among the Romans.—In the mathematical sciences, more than in any
other, the Romans stood upon the shoulders of the Greeks. Indeed, with
respect to cyclometry, they not only did not add anything to the Grecian
discoveries, but often evinced even that they either did not know of the
beautiful result obtained by Archimedes or at least did not knuw how to
appreciate it. For instance, Vitruvius, who lived during the time of
Augustus, computed that a wheel 4 feet in diameter must measure 124
feet in circumference; in other words, he made z equal to 3f. And,
similarly, a treatise on surveying, preserved to us in the Gudian manu-
script of the library at Woifenbiittel, contains the following instructions
to square the circle: Divide the circumference of a circle into four parts
and make one part the side of a square; this square will be equal in
area to the circle. Aside from the fact that the rectification of the are
of a circle is requisite to the construction of a square of this kind, the
Roman quadrature, viewed as a calculation, is more inexact even than
any other computation; for its result is that z= 4.

Among the Hindus.—The mathematical performances of the Hindus
were not only greater than those of the Romans, but in certain directions
even surpassed those of the Greeks. In the most ancient source for the
inathematies of India that we know of, the Culvasiitras, which date back
tou a little before our chronological era, we do not find, it is true, the
squaring of the cirele treated of, but the opposite problem is dealt with
which might fittingly be termed the circling of the square. The half of
the side of a given square is prolonged one-third of the excess in length
of half the diagonal over half the side, and the line thus obtained is taken
as the radius of the circle equal in area to the square. The simplest way
to obtain an idea of the exactness of this construction is to compute how
great z would have to be if the construction were exactly correct. We
find out in this way that the value of z, upon which the Indian circling of
the square is based, is about from five to six hundredths smaller than the
true value, whereas the approximate z of Archimedes, 31, is only from
one to two thousandths too large, and the old Egyptian value exceeds
the true value by from one to two hundredths. Cyclometry very prob-
ably made great advances among the Hindus in the first four or five
centuries of our era; for Aryabhatta, who lived about the year 500 after
Christ, states that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is
62832 — 20000, an approximation that in exactness surpasses even that of
Ptolemy. The Hindu result gives 3-1416 for z, while z really lies be-
tween 3°141592 and 3141593. How the Hindus obtained this excellent
approximate value is told by Ganega, the commentator of Bhaskara, an
author of the twelfth century. Ganega says that the method of Archi-
110 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

medes was carried still farther by the Hindu mathematicians; that by
continually doubling the number of sides they proceeded from the hex-
agon to a polygon of 384 sides, and that by the comparison of the cir-
cumferences of the inscribed and circumscribed 384-sided polygons they
found that 7 was equal to 3927+—1250. It will be seen that the value
given by Bhaskara is identical with the value of Aryabhatta. It is
further worthy of remark that the earlier of these two Hindu mathe-
maticians does not mention either the value 31 of Archimedes or the
value 3,43, of Ptolemy, but that the later knows of both values and
especially recommends that of Archimedes as the most useful one for
practical application. Strange to say, the good approximate value of
Arybhatta does not occur in Bramagupta, the great Hindu mathema-
tician who flourished in the beginning of the seventh century; but we
find the curious information in this author that the area of a circle is
exactly equal to the square root of 10 when the radius is unity. The
value of z as derivable from this formula (a value from two to three
hundredths too large) has unquestionably arisen upon Hindu soil, for
‘t oceurs in no Grecian mathematician; and Arabian authors, who were
in a better position than we to know Greek and Hindu mathematical
literature, declare that the approximation which makes z equal to the
square root of 10 is of Hindu origin. It is possible that the Hindu
people, who were addicted more than any other to numeral mysticism,
sought to find in this approximation some connection with the fact that
man has ten fingers; and ten accordingly is the basis of their numeral
system.

Reviewing the achievements of the Hindus generally with respect to
the problem of the quadrature, we are brought to recognize that this
people, whose talents lay more in the line of arithmetical computation
than in the perception of spatial relations, accomplished as good as noth-
ing on the pure geometrical side of the problem, but that the merit be-
longs to them of having carried the Archimedean method of computing =
several stages farther, and of having obtained in this way a much more
exact value for it;—a circumstance that is explainable when we consider
that the Hindus are the inventors of our present system of numeral
notation, possessing which they easily outdid Archimedes, who em-
ployed the awkward Greek system.

Among the Chinese.—With regard to the Chinese, this people operated
in ancient times with the Babylonian value for z, or 3, but possessed
knowledge of the approximate value of Archimedes, at least since the
end of the sixth century. Besides this, there appears in a number of
Chinese mathematical treatises an approximate value peculiarly their
own, in which -=3, ; a value, however, which, notwithstanding it is
written in large figures, is no better than that of Archimedes. At-
tempts at the constructive quadrature of the circle are not found among
the Chinese.
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 111

Among the Arabs.—Greater were the merits of the Arabians in the
advancement and development of mathematics, and especially in virtue
of the fact that they preserved from oblivion both Greek and Hindu
mathematics, and handed them down to the Christian countries of the ,
West. The Arabians expressly distinguished between the Archimedean
approximate value and the two Hindu values, the square root of 10 and
the ratio 62832: 20000. This distinction occurs also in Muhammed Iba
Musa Alchwarizmi, the same scholar who in the beginning of the ninth
century brought the principles of our present system of numerical nota-
tion from India and introduced the same into the Mohammedan world.
The Arabians however studied not only the numerical quadrature of
the circle, but also the coustructive; as, for instance, [bn Alhaitam,
who lived in Egypt about the year 1000, and whose treatise upon the
squaring of the circle is preserved in a Vatican codex, which has un-
fortunately not yet been edited.

In Christian times.—Christian civilization, to which we are now about
to pass, produced up to the second half of the fifteenth century extremely
insignificant results in mathematics. Even with regard to our present
problem We have but a single important work to mention—the work,
namely, of Frankos Von Liittich upon the squaring of the circle, pub-
lished in six books, but only preserved in fragments. The author, who
lived in the first half of the eleventh century, was probably a pupil of
Pope Sylvester 0, himself a not inconsiderable mathematician for his
time, and who also wrote the most celebrated book on geometry of the
period.

Cardinal Nicolaus de Cusa.—Greater interest came to be bestowed
upon mathematics in general, but especially on the problem of the
quadrature of the circle, in the second half of the fifteenth century,
when the sciences again began to revive. This interest was especially
aroused by Cardinal Nicolaus De Cusa, a man highly esteemed on ac-
count of his astronomical and calendarial studies. He claimed to have
discovered the quadrature of the circle by the employment solely of
compasses and ruler, and thus attracted the attention of scholars to
the now historic problem. People believed the famous cardinal and
marvelled at his wisdom, until Regiomontanus, in letters which he wrote
in 1464 and 1465, and which were published in 1533, rigidly demon-
strated that the cardinal’s quadrature was incorrect. The construction
of Cusa was as follows:.The radius of a circle is prolonged a distance
equal to the side of the inscribed square; the line thus obtained is taken
as the diameter of a second circle, and in the latter an equilateral trian-
gle is described ; then the perimeter of the latter is equal to the cireum-
ference of the original circle. If this construction, which its inventor
regarded as exact, be considered as a construction of approximation, it
will be found to be more inexact even than the construction resulting
from the value <=31. For by Cusa’s method = would be from five to
six thousandths smaller than it really is.
112 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE,

Bovillius, and Orontius Fineus.—In the beginning of the sixteenth
century a certain Bovillius appears, who announced anew the construc-
tion of Cusa, meeting, however, with no notice. But about the middle
of the sixteenth century a book was published which the scholars of
the time at first received with interest. It bore the proud title * De
Rebus Mathematicis Hactenus Desideratis.” Its author, Orontius
Finzeus, represented that he had overcome all the difficulties that had
ever stood in the way of geometrical investigators; and incidentally be
also communicated to the world the “true quadrature” of the circle.
His fame was short-lived. For afterwards, in a book entitled “De
Erratis Orontii,” the Portuguese Petrus Nonius demonstrated that
Orontius’s quadrature, like most of his other professed discoveries, was
incorrect.

Simon Van Eyck.—In the period following this the number of cirele-
squarers so increased that we shall have to limit ourselves to those
whom mathematicians recognize. And particularly is Simon Van Eyck
to be mentioned, who towards the close of the sixteenth century pub-
lished a quadrature which was so approximate that the value of z de-
rived from it was more exact than that of Archimedes ; and to’ disprove
it the mathematician Peter Metius was obliged to geek a still more
accurate value than 31. The erroneous quadrature of Van Eyck was
thus the occasion of Metius’ s discovery that the ratio 355: 113, or 3,45,
varied from the true value of z by less than one one millionth, eligi
accordingly all values hitherto obtained. Moreover it is demonstrable
by the theory of continued fractions that, admitting figures to four
places only, no two numbers more exactly represent the value of z than
355 and 113.

Joseph Scaliger.—in the same way the quadrature of the great phi-
lologist, Joseph Sealiger, led to refutations. Like most circle-squarers
who believe in their discovery, Scaliger also was little versed in the
elements of geometry. He solved, however—at least in his own opin-
ion he did—tie famous problem; and published in 1592 a book upon
it, which bore the pretentious title “ Nova Cyclometria,” and in which
the name of Archimedes was derided. The worthlessness of his sup-
posed discovery was demonstrated to him by the greatest mathematic-
ians of his time, namely, Vieta, Adrianus Romanus, and Clavius.

Longomontanus, John Porta, and Gregory of St. Vincent.—Of the erring
circle-squarers that flourished before the middle of the seventeenth
century three others deserve particular mention;—Longomontanus of
Copenhagen, who rendered such great services to astronomy, the Nea-
pieenaeitey Porta, and Gregory of St. Vincent. Longomontanus made
m=3 4 155,, and was so convinced of the correctness of his result that
he thanked God fervently, in the preface to his work “ Inventio Quad-
rature Cireuli,” that He had granted him in his high old age the
strength to conquer the celebrated difficulty. Jolin Porta followed the
initiative of Hippocrates, and believed he had solved the problem by
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 113

the comparison of lunes. GregoryofSt. Vincent published a quadrature
the error of which was very hard to detect, but was finally discovered
by Descartes. |

Peter Metius, and Vieta.—Of the famous mathematicians who dealt
with our problem in the period between the close of the fifteenth cen-
tury and the time of Newton, we first meet with Peter Metius, before
mentioned, who succeeded in finding in the fraction 355:113 the best
approximate value for z involving only small numbers. The problem
received a different advancement at the hands of the famous mathema-
tician Vieta. Vieta was the first to whom the idea occurred of repre-
senting z with mathematical exactness by an infinite series of contin-
uable operations. By comparison of inscribed and _ circumscribed
polygons, Vieta found that we approach nearer and nearer to z if we
allow the operations of the extraction of the square root of 4 and of
addition and of multiplication to succeed each other in a certain man-
ner, and that < must come out exactly if this series of operations could
be indefinitely continued. Vieta thus found that to a diameter of 10,000
million units a circumference belongs of 31,415 million, and from
926,535 to 926,536 units of the same length.

Adrianus Romanus, Ludolf Van Ceulen.—But Vieta was outdone by
the Netherlander Adrianus Romanus, who added fiveadditional decimal
places tothe ten of Vieta. To accomplish this he computed with un-
speakable labor the circumference of a regular circumscribed polygon
of 1,073,741,824 sides. This number is the thirtieth power of 2. Yet
great as the labor of Adrianus Romanus was, that of Ludolf Van Ceu-
len was still greater, for the latter calculator succeeded in carrying the
Archimedean process of approximation for the value of z to 35 decimal
places, that is, the deviation from the true value was smaller than one
one thousand quintillionth, a degree of exactness that we can hardly
have any conception of. Ludolf published the figures of the tremendous
computation that led to this result. His calculation was carefully ex-
amined by the mathematician Griemberger and declared to be correct.
Ludolf was justly proud of his work, and, following the example of
Archimedes, requested in his will that the result of his most important
mathematical performance, the computation of z to 35 decimal places,
be engraved upon his tombstone, a request which is said to have been
carried out. In honor of Ludolf, z is called to-day in Germany the
Ludolfian number.

The new method of Snell. Huygens’s verification of it.—Although
through the labor of Ludolf a degree of exactness for cyclometrical
operations was now obtained that was more than sufficient for any
practical purpose that could ever arise, neither the problem of construe-
tive rectification nor that of constructive quadrature was thereby in
any respect theoretically advanced. The investigations conducted by
the famous mathematicians and physicists Huygens and Snell, about
the middle of the seventeenth century, were more important from amathe-

H. Mis. 12 8

114 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

matical point of view than the work of Ludolf. Inhis book Cyclometri-
cus Snell took the position that the method of comparison of polygons,
which originated with Archimedes and was employed by Ludolf, need
by no means be the best method of attaining the end sought; and he
succeeded, by the employment of propositions which state that certain
ares of a ciral are greater or smaller than certain straight lines con-
nected with the cirele, in obtaining methods that make it possible to
reach results like the Ludolfian with much less labor of calculation.
The beautiful theorems of Snell were proved a second time, and better
proved, by the celebrated Dutch promoter of the science of optics,
Huygens (Opera Varia, pp. 365 et seq.; Theoremata De Cireuli et Hy-
perbolae Quadratura, 1651), as well as perfected in many ways. Snell
and Huygens were fully aware that they had advanced only the prob-
lem of numerical quadrature, and not that of the constructive quadra-
ture. This, in Huygens’s case, plainly appeared from the vehement
dispute he conducted with the English mathematician, James Gregory.
This controversy has some significance for the history of our problem,
from the fact that Gregory made the first attempt to prove that the
squaring of the circle with ruler and compasses must be impossible.

The controversy between Huygens and Gregory.—The result of the con-
troversy, to which we owe many valuable treatises, was that Huygens
finally demonstrated in an incontrovertible manner the incorrectness of
Gregory’s proof of impossibility, adding that he also was of opiuion
that the solution of the problem with ruler and compasses was impossi-
ble, but nevertheless was not himself able to demonstrate this fact.
And Newton, later, expressed himself to a similar effect. As a matter
of fact it took till the most recent period, that is over 200 years, until
higher mathematics was far enough advanced, to furnish a rigid dem-
onstration of impossibility.

Before we proceed to consider the promotive influence which the in-
vention of the differential and the integral calculus had upon our prob-
lem, we shall enumerate a few at least of that never-ending line of
mistaken quadrators who have delighted the world by the fruits of their
ingenuity from the time of Newton to the present period ; and out of a
pious and sincere consideration for the contemporary world, we shall
entirely omit in this to speak of the circle-squarers of our own time.

Hobbes’s quadrature.—First to be mentioned is the celebrated English
philosopher Hobbes. In his book, De Problematis Physicis, in which he
chiefly proposes to explain the phenomena of gravity and of ocean
tides, he also takes up the quadrature of the circle and gives a very
trivial construction that in his opinion definitively solved the problem,
making ~=31. In view of Hobbes’s importance as a philosopher, two
mathematicians, Huygens and Wallis, thought it proper to refute
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. 115

Hobbes at length. But Hobbes defended his position in a special
treatise, in which, to sustain at least the appearance of being right, he
disputed the fundamental principles of geometry and the theorem of
Pythagoras ; so that mathematicians could pass on from him to the
order of the day.

French quadrators of the eighteenth century.—In the last century
France especially was rich in circle-squarers. We will mention:
Oliver de Serres, who by means of a pair of scales determined that
a circle weighed as much as the square upon the side of the equi-
lateral triangle inscribed in it, that therefore they must have the
same area, an experiment in which z=3; Mathulon, who offered in
legal form a reward of a thousand dollars to the person who would
point out an error in his solution of the problem, and who was actually
compelled by the courts to pay the money; Basselin, who believed that
his quadrature must be right because it agreed with the approximate
value of Archimedes, and who anathematized his ungrateful contem-
poraries, in the confidence that he would be recognized by posterity ;
Liger, who proved that a part is greater than the whole, and to whom
therefore the quadrature of the circle was child’s play ; Clerget, who
based his solution upon the principle that a circle is a polygon of a
definite number of sides, and who calculated, also, among other things,
how large the point is at which two circles touch.

Germany and Poland.—Germany and Poland also furnish their contin-
gent to the army of circle-squarers. Lieutenant-Colonel Corsonich pro-
duced a quadrature in which z equaled 34, and promised 50 dueats to the
person who could prove that it was incorrect. Hesse, of Berlin, wrote an
arithmetic in 1776, in which a true quadrature was also “ made known,”
z being exactly equal to 334. About the same time Professor Bischoff,
of Stettin, defended a quadrature previously published by Captain
Leistner, preacher Merkel, and schoolmaster Bohm, which made =z
implicite equal to the square of $2 not even attaining the approximation
of Archimedes.

Constructive approximations—Euler, Kocahnsky.—From attempts of
this character are to be clearly distinguished constructions of ap-
proximation in which the inventor is aware that he has not found
a mathematically exact construction, but only an approximate one.
The value of such a construction will depend upon two things—first,
upon .the degree of exactness with which it is numerically expressed,
and secondly on the fact whether the construction can be more or
less easily made with ruler and compasses. Constructions of this kind,
simple in form and yet sufficiently exact for practical purposes, have
for centuries been furnished us in great numbers. The great math-
ematician, Euler, who died in 1783, did not think it out of place to
attempt an approximate construction of this kind. A very simple con-
struction for the rectification of the circle, and one which has passed
116 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

into many geometrical text books, is that published by Kochansky in
1685, in the Leipziger Berichte. It is as follows:

Erect upon the diameter of a circle at its extremities perpendiculars ; with the center
as vertex, mark off upon the diameter an angle of 30°; find the point of intersection
with the perpendicular of the line last drawn, and join this point of intersection with
that point upon the other perpendicular, which is at a distance of three radii from the
base of the perpendicular. The line of junction thus obtained is then very approxi-
mately equal to one-half of the circumference of the given circle.

Calculation shows that the difference between the true length of the
circumference and the line thus constructed is less than 97°59 of the
diameter.

Inutility of constructive approximations.—Althougk such construc-
tions of approximation are very interesting in themselves, they never-
theless play but a subordinate role in the history of the squaring of the
circle; for on the one hand they can never furnish greater exactness
for circle computation than the thirty-five decimal places which Ludolf
found, and on the other hand they are not adapted to advance in any
way the question whether the exact quadrature of the circle with ruler
and compasses is possible.

The researches of Newton, Leibnitz, Wallis, and Brouncker.—The
numerical side of the problem, however, was considerably advanced
by the new mathematical methods perfected by Newton and Leibnitz,
commonly called the differential and the integral calculus. And
about the middle of the seventeenth century, some time before New-
ton and Leibnitz represented z by series of powers, the English mathema-
ticians Wallis and Lord Brouncker, Newton’s predecessors in a certain
sense, succeeded in representing z by an infinite series of figures com-
bined by the first four rules of arithmetic. A new method of computa-
tion was thus opened. Wallis found that the fourth part of = is repre-
sented more exactly by the regularly formed product

2x4x4ixx$xK ix 5G X, ete,

o o

the farther the multiplication is continued, and that the result always
comes out too small if we stop at a proper fraction, but too large if we
stop at an improper fraction. Lord Brouncker, on the other hand, rep-
resents the value in question by a continued fraction in which all the
denominators are equal to 2 and the numerators are odd square num-
bers. Wallis, towhom Brouncker had communicated his elegant result
without proof, demonstrated the same in his “Arithmetic of Infinites.”

The computation of z could hardly be farther advanced by these re-
sults than Ludolf and others had carried it, though of course in a more
laborious way. However, the series of powers derived by the assistance
of the differential calculus of Newton and Leibnitz furnished a means
of computing = to hundreds of decimal places.

Other calculations.—Gregory, Newton, and Leibnitz next found that
the fourth part of = was equal exactly to
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. Li

Es a= aia TI gi)

if we conceive this series, which is called the Leibnitzian, indefinitely
continued. This seriesis indeed wonderfully simple, but is not adapted
to the computation of z, for the reason that entirely too many members
have to be taken into account to obtain z accurately to a few decimal
places only. The original formula, however, from which this series is
derived, gives other formulas which are excellently adapted to the ac-
tual computation. This formula is the general series:

a=a—sa>+lar—la'+...,

where a is the length of the are that belongs to any central angle in a
circle of radius 1, and where a is the tangent to this angle. From this
we derive the following:

=(a+b+e+... )—d(B4 +4 2...) 4+) (WLP HOH . 6. moors

he

where a, b,c... are the tangents of angles whose sum is 45°, Deter-
mining, therefore, the values of a,b, c..., which are equal to small
and easy fractions and fulfill the condition just mentioned, we obtain
series of powers which are adapted to the computation of z. The first
to add by the aid of series of this description additional decimal places
to the old 35 in the number z was the English arithmetician Abraham
Sharp, who, following Halley’s instructions, in 1700, worked out =z to
72 decimal places. A little later Machin, professor of astronomy in
London, computed z to 100 decimal places; putting, in the series given
above, a=b=c=d=1 and e=— ;},, that is employing the following
Series:

J au
ee oat 07 capt Grae os

In the year 1819, Lagny, of Paris, outdid the computation of Machin,
determining in two different ways the first 127 decimal places of =.
Vega then obtained as many as 140 places, and the Hamburg arithme-
tician, Zacharias Dase, went as far as 200 places. The latter did not use
Machin’s series in his calculation, but the series produced by putting
in the general series above given a=3, b=1, c=}. Finally, at a recent
date, z has been computed to 500 places.

The computation to so many decimal places may serve as an illustra-
tion of the excellence of the modern method as contrasted with those
anciently employed, but otherwise it has neither a theoretical nor a
practical value. That the computation of < to say 15 decimal places
more than sufficiently satisfies the subtlest requirements of practice may
be gathered from a concrete example of the degree of exactness thus
obtainable.
118 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE.

Idea of exactness obtainable with the approximate values of x.—Im-
agine a circle to be described with Berlin as center, and the circum-
ference to pass through Hamburg; then let the circumference of the
circle be computed by multiplying its diameter with the value of z to
15 decimal places, and then conceive it to be actually measured. The
deviation from the true length in 30 large a circle as this even could
not be as great as the 18 millionth part of a millimetre.

An idea can hardly be obtained of the degree of exactness produced
by 100 decimal places. But the following example may possibly give
us some conception of it. Conce‘ve a sphere constructed with the earth
as center, and imagine its surface to pass through Sirius, which is 1343
million million kilometres distant from us. Then imagine this enormous
sphere to be so packed wich microbes that in every cubic millimetre
millions of millions of these diminutive animalcula are present. Now
conceive these microbes to be all unpacked and so distributed singiy
along a straight line that every two microbes are as far distant from
each other as Sirus from us, that is, 1344 million million kilometres.
Conceive the long line thus fixed by all the microbes as the diameter of
a circle, and imagine the circumference of it to be calculated by multi-
plying its diameter with z to 100 decimal places. Then, in the case of a
circle of this enormous magnitude even, the circumference thus caleu-
lated would not vary from the real circumference by a millionth of a
millimetre.

This example will suffice to show that the calculation of z to 100 or
500 decimal places is wholly useless.

Professor Wolff’s curious method.—Before we close this chapter upon
the evaluation of z, we must mention the method, less fruitful than
curious, which Professor Wolff, of Zurich, employed some decades ago
to compute the value of z to 3 places. The floor of a room is divided
up into equal squares, so as to resemble a huge chess-board, and a
needle exactly equal in length to the side of each of these squares is
east haphazard upon the floor. If we calculate now the probabilities of
the needle so falling as to lie wholly within one of the squares, that is,
so that it does not cross any of the parallel lines forming the squares,
the result of the calculation for this probability will be found to be ex-
actly equal to 7 —3. Consequently a sufficient number of casts of the
needle according to the law of large numbers mst give the value of z
approximately. Asa matter of fact, Professor Wi.f, after 10,000 trials,
obtained the value of z correctly to 3 decimal places.

IV.--PROOF THAT THE PROBLEM -~ iNSOLVABLE.

Mathematicians sow seek to prove the insolvability of the problem.
Fruitful as the calculus of Newton and Leibnitz was for the evalu-
ation of z, the problem of converting a circle into a square having ex-
actly the same area was in no wise advanced thereby. Wallis, Newton,
Leibnitz, and theirimmediate followers distinctly recognized this. The
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE. : 119

quadrature of the circle could not be solved; but it also could not be
proved that the problem was insolvable with ruler and compasses,
although everybody was convinced of its insolvability. In mathemat-
ics, however, a conviction is only justified when supported by incon-
trovertible proof; and in the place of endeavors to solve the quadra-
ture there accordingly now come endeavors to prove the impossibility
of solving the celebrated problem.

Lamberts contribution.—The first step in this direction, small as it
was, was made by the French mathematician Lambert, who proved in
the year 1761 that z was neither a rational number nor even the square
root of a rational number; that is, that neither z nor the square of =
can be exactly represented by a fraction the denominator and nume-
rator of which are whole numbers, however great the numbers be taken.
Lambert’s proof showed, indeed, that the rectification and the quadra-
ture of the circle could not be possibly accomplished in the particular
way in which its impossibility was demonstrated, but it still did not
exclude the possibility of the problem being solvable in some other more
complicated way, and without requiring further aids than ruler and
compasses.

The conditions of the demonstration.— Proceeding slowly but surely it
was next sought to discover the essential distinguishing properties that
separate problems solvable with ruler aud compasses, from problems
the construction of which is elementarily impossible, that is, by solely
employing the postulates. Slight reflection showed that a problem ele-
mentarily solvable, must always possess the property of having the
unknown lines in the figure relating to it connected with the known
lines of the figure by an equation for the solution of which equations of
the first and second degree alone are requisite, and which may be so
disposed that the common measures of the known lines will appear only
as integers. The conclusion was to be drawn from this, that if the
quadrature of the circle and consequently its rectification were ele-
mentarily solvable, the number z, which represents the ratio of the
unknown circumference to the known diameter, must be the root of a
certain equation, of a very high degree perhaps, but in which all the
numbers that appear are whole numbers; that is, there would have to
exist an equation, made up entirely of whole numbers, which would be
correct if its unknown quantity were made equal to z.

Final success of Professor Lindemann.—Since the beginning of this
century, consequently, the efforts of a number of mathematicians have
been bent upon proving that z generally is not algebraical, that is,
that it can not be the root of any equation having whole numbers for
coefficients. But mathematics had to make tremendous strides for-
ward before the means were at hand to accomplish this demonstration.
After the French academician, Professor Hermite, had furnished im-
portant preparatory assistance in his treatise Sur la Fonction Expo-
nentielle, published in the seventy-seventh volume of the Comptes
120 THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE,

Rendus, Professor Lindemann, at that time of Freiburg, now of Konigs-
berg, finally succeeded, in June, 1882, in rigorously demonstrating that
the number = is not algebraical,* thus supplying the first proof that
the problems of the rectification and the squaring of the circle, with
the help only of algebraical instruments like ruler and compasses are
insolvable. Lindemann’s proof appeared successively in the Reports

French Academy (vol. Cxv, pp. 72-74), ard in the Mathematischen An-
nalen (vol. XX, pp. 213-225).

The verdict of mathematics.—“It is impossible with ruler and com-
passes to construct a square equal in area to a given circle.” These are
the words of the final determination of a controversy which is as old
as the history of the human mind. But the race of circle-squarers, un-
mindful of the verdict of mathematics, that most infallible of arbiters,
will never die out so long as ignorance and the thirst for glory shall be
united.

developed relations between certain definite integrals (Comptes Rendus of the Paris
Academy, 1273, vol. Lxxvi1). Proceeding from the relations thus established, Pro-
fessor Lindemann first demonstrates the following proposition: If the coefficients of
an equation of nth degree are all real or complex whole numbers and the n roots of this
equation 2, 2,..., 2, are different from zero and from each other it is impossible for

that also between the functions

variant from zero. Finally the beautiful theorem results: If z is the root of an irre-

ing of the circle with ruler and compasses were possible, however, 7 would have the
property last mentioned.
PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

By WILuLIAM C. WINLOCK.

The following record of astronomy for the years 1889 and 1890 is
presented in essentially the same form as its predecessors. The com-
piler has made free use of reviews, in the various branches of astronomy,
contributed by specialists to the Atheneum, Nature, Journal of the As-
tronomical Society of the Pacific, the Observatory, Bulletin Astronomique,
the Astronomical Journal, and other periodicals.

NEBULA.

Motions of the planetary nebule in the line of sight.—No. 11 of the Pub-
lications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific contains a very
important paper by Mr. James E. Keeler on the ‘“‘ Motions of the plan-
etary nebule in the line of sight.” The paper is an important one in a
twofold aspect: first, in its bearing on a matter just now under dis-
cussion by the highest authorities, as to the character and position of
the brightest nebular line, and secondly, in the evidence it affords of
nebular movements.

As to the character of the nebular line, Mr. Keeler’s testimony is
most emphatic, and entirely confirms Dr. Huggins’s observations. ‘The
nebular lines,” he reports, “appeared to be perfectly monochromatic
images of the slit, widening when the slit was widened and narrowing
to excessively fine sharp lines when it was closed up.” The chief neb-
ular line ‘‘ showed no tendency to assume the aspect of a remnant of
fluting under any circumstances of observation.” This observation,
made not on one nebula, but on a number, and with a dispersion often
equivalent to that of 24 prisms of 60°, for the fourth spectrum of a
Rowland’s grating of 14,438 lines to the inch was often used, is by far
the strongest evidence we have yet had on this question of the charac-
ter of the chief nebular line, and it is dead against Mr. Lockyer’s
theory.

The position of the nebular line is also fixed with very considerable
certainty ; and here, again, Dr. Huggins’s observations receive complete
confirmation. It was not, in any one of the nebule observed, coincident

with the fluting of magnesium, but was always seen some distance to
121
122 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

the blue. The importance of this observation, especially when taken
with the report as to the character of the line, is of the highest kind in
its bearing on Mr. Lockyer’s great meteoritic theory. If the chief neb-
ular line is not the remnant of the magnesium fluting the very keystone
is knocked away from the arch and the edifice as such falls to pieces.
No doubt there would be many isolated fragments of considerable value
still left. The structure mighteven be put together again, hereafter, on
a new plan, and with a more lasting result, but the theory as it now
stands—the theory as a whole—would be irretrievably wrecked. On
the other hand, if the identity which Mr. Lockyer asserts were estab-
lished, it would be a victory for him of the first importance.

It is indicative of the progress of practical spectroscopy that the
whole question turns on an almost inappreciable difference of position,
the mean value for the wave-length of the nebular line as found by Mr.
Keeler from ten nebule, being 5,005.68 tenth-meters, whilst that of the
fluting of magnesiuin is 5,006.36. In the brightest nebula examined the
wave-length obtained was 5,006.13 tenth-meters, only 0.23 distant from
the magnesium fluting. As the observations stand they point strongly
to the nebular line being slightly but distinctly more refrangible than
the edge of the magnesium fluting, and therefore not due to it. But
the amount of displacement is not so great as to make it altogether in-
conceivable that it is due to the relative motion of the nebule and the
solar system, for all the ten nebul observed are in that hemisphere
toward which the sun is travelling, and seven of them are within 45° of
the apex of the “Sun’s Way,” so that a correction must be applied
which would tend to bring the nebular line nearer to the fluting; how
much nearer we cannot, in our ignorance of the speed of the sun’s
motion in space, at present say, but a rate of 36 miles per second would
suffice to make the accord a perfect one. If Mr. Keeler could obtain a
series of comparisons of the line in these nebule with hydrogen, the
problem would be solved. Or the determination of the place of the
line in a number of nebul in the hemisphere we are leaving would go
far to settle the matter. In the mean time it is still possible that the
eventual result may favor Mr. Lockyer’s theory. It may be added in
reference to Mr. Lockyer’s paper, appearing in No. 293 of the Proceed-
ings of the Royal Society, that if we accept Mr. Keeler’s measures it is
clear that Mr. Lockyer did not employ sufficient dispersion to decide
the point at issue.

The second point brought out by Mr. Keeler’s measures is the fact
that the nebule have very distinct movements of theirown. As we do
not yet know to what substance the chief nebular line is due, and as
Mr. Keeler could not make any measures of the blue hydrogen line in
the nebule at all comparable in accuracy to those he made of the chief
line, we can not say that the difference in position of the chief line from
any given comparison line is due to the motion of the nebula. ATI we
can do at present is to observe a number of nebule, adopt the mean
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 123

place they give as the true position of the nebular line, and record the
differences from this mean as due to differences of motion from the
mean motion. The extreme difference observed between any two
nebulze amounted to very nearly 70 miles per second.

It is impossible to leave this paper without a word on the accuracy
ofthe measures. The spectrum of ¥ 6 was examined on nine nights.
The greatest difference of any one night’s observation from the mean
was only 0.11 tenth-metre, or in miles per second 4.2; the mean dif-
ference but 0.04, or in miles per second 1.5. Such accuracy was only
possible by using an enormous dispersion, and it implies very perfect
instrumental and atmospheric conditions. But it also implies an ex-
treme delicacy of eye and hand in the observer ; the ‘man behind the
telescope” is in evidence. For it should be remembered that the great
size of the Lick telescope is no special advantage in work of this par-
ticular class, its high proportion of focal length to aperture being a
distinct disadvantage. A much smaller object-glass, with a focal length
of 12 to 1, would give brighter images.—(E. W. MAUNDER. The Ob-
servatory, No. 168.)

Mr. Lockyer having published some results at variance with those
obtained by Dr. and Mrs. Huggins with respect to the principal line
in the spectrum of the great nebula in Orion, they have made careful
re determinations, decisively confirming their previous results: (1) that
the principal line is not coincident with, but falls within, the termina-
tion of the magnesium flame band; (2) that in the nebula in Orion this
line presents no appearance of being a ‘ fluting.”

The faint star discovered in the trapezium of the Orion nebula by
Alvan Clark, when the Lick telescope was first mounted, has been
found by Barnard to be double, another star has also been detected in
the trapezium by Barnard, and also one of about the same magni-
tude (sixteenth) as the Clark star just preceding the trapezium.

Within the ring of the well-known ring nebula of Lyra six stars have
been found by Holden and Schaeberle with the 36-inch Lick telescope
where but one was known before, and five new stars have been tound
in the nebulosity.

ASTRONOMICAL CONSTANTS.

Refraction.—M. Radau has published in volume 19 of the Paris Observ-
atory Annales a very complete memoir on astronomical refraction, which
deals with the theoretical as well as the practical side of the question,
and contains complete tables in a convenient form suitable for actual
computation.

Diurnal nutation.—M. Folie’s work on diurnal nutation has not met
with general acceptance. One of the latest discussions of the subject
is that by Herr Lehman Filhés, published in No. 2975 of the Astronom-
asche Nachrichten.
124 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1800,

Precession.—A useful table of the third term of the precession has
been computed by Herr Kloock and published by the Kiel Observatory.

Harkness’s astronomical, physical, and geodetic constants.—Prof. Win.
Harkness, of the U. S. Naval Observatory, has been at work for some
time upon a homogeneous system of inter-related constants, more
trustworthy values of which are to be attained by the solution of equa-
tions of condition, in which the best values resulting from observation
are introduced and combined with the expression of their mutual re-
Jations.

A preliminary communication of results was made to the Astronom-
ical Journal, No. 194, but it seems preferable to quote here the final
values published by Professor Harkness in Appendix III to the Wash-
ington Observations for 1891, though the latter work was not issued
till after the close of the year 1890.

Professor Harkness has collected the various determinations of each
of the constants in question, decided upon the values to be adopted in
the computations, often using the method of least squares for this pur-
pose; and has then employed this method in order to obtain a resultant
homogeneous system.

Among the results obtained are the following:

Earth’s equatorial semi-diameter -.......--.---.----6,377 972 + 1 248 meters.

kilometers. |

STAR CATALOGUES.

The star catalogue of the Astronomische Gesellschaft.—The first parts
of the great catalogue of the Astronomische Gesellschaft appeared in
1890. They are the volumes containing the catalogues of zones ob-
served by Krueger at Helsingfors and Gotha, by Boss, at Albany, and
by Fearnley and Geelmuyden at Christiania. ‘The two first mentioned
volumes contain respectively the positions of 14,680 and of 8,241 stars
for the equinox of 1875.

It may be worth while to recall here the origin of this great under-
taking, now nearing completion. The zones of the Histoire céleste
Jrangaise, published by Lalande comprise about 50,000 stars from
the first to the eighth magnitude, but they were not catalogued till
nearly half a century after theircompletion. Those of Bessel, observed
at Koenigsberg from 1821 to 1833, contain 62,600 stars from the first to
the ninth magnitude between —15° and + 45° declination; the two cata-
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 125

logues of Weisse appeared in 1846 and 1863. From 1841 to 1852 Arge-
lander continued his work at Bonn, and his northern zones (published in
1846) contain 22,000 stars between +45° and +80° and the southern
zoues (published in 1852) 17,000 between —15° and —319, catalogued
by Oeltzen (1851 to 1857). The positions in these different catalogues
depend upon meridian observations.

In 1852, having finished his zones, Argelander conceived the plan of a
work of much greaterextent. It was to fix approximately the positions
of all stars to the ninth magnitude, and perhaps a little below (9.5), visi-
ble in our Jatitudes. To accomplish this the plan was to employ simply a
small telescope, the observer, with his eye always at the telescope, to call
out to a recorder, who sat close by with a chronometer. The preliminary
trials, by J. Schmidt, being successful, the work was begun, and, with
the help of Krueger and Schoenfeld, on whom the greater part of the la-
bor fell, the revision of the northern sky was finished in 1859; and this
is the work that we know as the “‘ Bonn Durchmusterung.”

The Durchmusterung,published between 1859 and 1862 in volumes 3, 4,
and 5of the Bonn Observations, contains no less than 324,198 stars, lying
between 2° south declination and the north pole, the zone between +819
and the pole being a revision of Carrington’s catalogue. Volume 6 of
the “Bonn Beobachtungen,” contains futhermore 34,000 positions, deter-
mined by Argelander with the meridian circle. The stars of the
Durchmusterung are plotted on a series of charts published in 1863.
Since Argelander’s death Schoenfeld has completed a similar piece of
work for oursouthern sky, the ‘“ Stidliche Durchmusterung ” (1886), con-
taining more than 133,000 stars, between —2° and—23°, and Gould at
Cordoba has extended the zones to the neighborhood of the south pole.

Upon the organization of the International Astronomische Gesell-
schaft in 1865, the question at once came up of undertaking, by the co-op-
eration of several observatories, the exact determination of the positions
of all these stars provisionally catalogued in the Durchmusterung. A
programme for the work, prepared by a special committee, was. finally
decided upon at the meeting in Vienna in 1869. The new revision was
confined to the limits of —2° and +80° declination, the positions of
the circumpolars seeming to be sufficiently well known from the work
of Carrington and that of the astronomers at Hamburg and Kazan. The
zones were at first assigned as follows:

80° to 75° Kazan. 30° to 30° Leipzig.

75 to 70 Dorpat. 30 to 25 Cambridge (England),
70 to 65 Christiania. 25 to 15 Berlin.

65 to55 Helsingfors. 15 to 10 Leipzig.

- 5d to 50 ? 10 to 4 Mannheim.
50 to 40 Bonn. 4 to 1 Neufchatel.
40 to 35 Chicago. +1 to—2 Palermo.

Pulkowa undertook the determination of 539 fundamental stars eare-
fully selected by Dr. Auwers, which should form points of reference.
In the 20 years that have elapsed since the great catalogue was
126 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

decided upon several changes have been made in the original pro-
gramme, the work being eventually divided up among the following
observatories :

80° to 75° Kazan. 35° to €0° Leyden.

75 to70 Dorpat. 30 to 25 Cambridge (Eng.)
70 to65 Christiania. 25 to15 Berlin.

65 to 55 Helsingfors-Gotha. 15 to 5 Leipzig.

55 to50 Cambridge (U.S.). 5 to 1 Albany.

50 to40 Bonn. +1 to—2 Nicolaief.

40 to 35 Lund.

The work of observation is now finished. Some of the zones have
been published (Kazan, Christiania, Helsingfors, Lund), others are in
press, and the catalogues have been begun. Three of the catalogues
(Aibany, Helsingfors-Gotha, and Christiania,) have just appeared.
Meanwhile the zones have been extended to the southern sky, the fol-
lowing being to a greater or less extent under way:

—2° to-— 6° Strasburg. —14° to—18° Washington.
—6 to—10 Vienna. —18 to—23 Algiers.

—10 to— 14 Cambridge (U.S. ).

The positions of the 303 fundamental southern stars are furnished
by observations undertaken at the Cape of Good Hope, Madison,
Annapolis, Carlsruhe, Leiden, and Strasburg. Gould’s southern zones
extend from —23° to—80°, and it is to be hoped that before long we
shall have a catalogue embracing the whole sky, the value of which
will be in no wise diminished by the photographic chart which is about
to be begun.

The observations for the Helsingfors-Gotha catalogue were made al-
most entirely by Dr. Krueger with a0", 15 (5.9 inch) Reichenbach merid-
ian circle. The star positions are for the epoch 1875, and besides the
right ascension and declination, the precession and secular variation,
and wherever possible the proper motion are given. The observations
forthe Albany zone were made by Professor Boss with a 0™. 20 (7.9 inches)
Pistor & Martin’s meridian circle, the transits being recorded on the
chronograph, while Dr. Krueger used the “‘eye-and-ear ” method.

Experiments were made with wire-gauze sereens by Professor Boss
to determine the effect of difference of magnitude upon the observa-
tions, his result being that a change of one magnitude produced a
change of 0°.014 in the personal equation in observing a transit,
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 127

A third installment of the catalogue, that containing the stars from
4+-64° 50/ to +70° 10’, has also appeared. The observations were made
by Professors Fearnley and Geelmuyden with the Ertel meridian
circle of the Christiania Observatory, of 48 lines aperture. The prob-
able error of a single observation is given as + 08.054 in right ascension
(405.02 in a great circle) and -+0/.54 in declination.

Yarnall’s catalogue—A. third edition of the catalogue of southern
stars observed with the transit instrument and mural circle at the
U. 8S. Naval Observatory from 1845 to 1877 has been published, the
work of revision having been conducted by Professor Frisby. Great
pains have been taken to eliminate all errata detected in the previous
editions, both by the careful examination of published lists of correc-
tions and by comparisons with other catalogues. The whole number
of stars in the new edition is 10,964.

Munich catalogue.—Band 1 of the ‘‘ Neue Annalen der k. Sternwarte
in Bogenhausen bei Miinchen” contains a catalogue of 33,082 stars
down to the tenth magnitude inclusive, between —32° and +24° decli-
nation, reduced to the epoch 1880.0. The observations were made with
a Reichenbach meridian circle of 109™" (4.3 inches) aperture and
circle of 0.95™ (37.4 inches) diameter.

Second Melbourne catalogue.—This catalogue contains the results of
observations made with the old transit circle of 5 inches aperture from
the beginning of 1871 to the end of August, 1584; places of 1,211 stars
are given for 1880.

Brussels catalogue.—The Brussels catalogue contains 10,792 stars for
the epoch 1865, observed with the Brussels transit instrument and
mural circle in the years 1857—1878; the general catalogue is preceded
by the positions of the fundamental stars used in the reductions. A
supplement is to be published giving corrections to the catalogue due
to a number of inaccuracies detected in the reductions.

The Williams College catalogue of north polar stars.—Professor Saf-
ford has published a catalogue of right ascensions of 261 stars, mostly
within 10° of the north pole, and observed by him with the 44-inch
Repsold meridian circle of the Field Memorial Observatory at Williams-
town. The results have been reduced to the epoch 1885.0. Professor
Safford characterizes his catalogue as an ‘‘attempt to strengthen the
weak point of all our standard catalogues—the right ascensions of
polar stars,” and he draws the following conclusions from his work.

“First. Thatit is highly conducive to accuracy, systematic as well as
in detail, to base a catalogue of polar right ascensions upon standard
places in all hours of right ascension, rather than upon double transits
alone.

‘Second. That the introduction of meridian marks according to Struve
(long-focus object glasses, also suggested by Rittenhouse) is a great
advantage to the primary catalogues,
128 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

“ Third. That the eye-and-ear method should be retained as the stand-
ard within a narrow rather than a wide range of polar distance.

‘“ Fourth. That modern meridian instruments are subject to irregular
small changes of position, which are not direct functions of the tem-
perature; so that in all differential work it is better to keep a close
watch upon clock rate and instrumental adjustments rather than to
trust the instrumental zero points for more than 2 hours without rede-
termination of the most essential.

“Fifth. That the right ascensions here given are reasonably accurate-

“Sixth. That a thorough comparison of the chronographice and eye-
and-ear method within a wide range, both of magnitude and declina-
tion, is desirable.”

Greenwich 10-year catalogue, 1877 to 1886, published in the volume
of Greenwich Observations for 1887, contains 4,059 stars for the epoch
1880.0.

The catalogue of 303 reference stars for the southern zones of the
Astronomische Gesellschaft has been published by Dr. Auwers, and
although the material accumulated since 1880, when the provisional list
was issued, is not sufficient to give places of a thoroughly satisfactory
degree of accuracy, the final corrections will probably be extremely
small,

A collection of all available meridian observations of stars that will]
be within 1° of the north pole in 1900 has been prepared, under the
direction of Professor Pickering, by Miss Winlock and published as the
ninth memoir in volume 15 of the Harvard Observatory Annals.

STELLAR PARALLAX.

Professor Pritcoard intends to examine for parallax, by the aid of
photography, all stars of the second magnitude suitably situated for
observation at Oxford, in the hope of contributing to our knowledge of
what Herschel called the “ construction of the heavens.” With refer-
ence to the differences in the results obtained by different observers,
Professor Pritchard says: ‘Guided by the suggestions of recent experi-
ence, | now think that such differences of ‘ parallax’ might very reason-
ably have been anticipated and may probably be accepted as matters
of fact without in any degree impugning the accuracy of the observa-
tions. For in process of this work on parallax, and also from the gen- |
eral history of similar inquiries, it has been made abundantly evident
that no necessary connection exists between the brightoess of a star
and its position in space, or distance from the sun. Nevertheless it
is this very difference of brightness mainly which guides us in the
selection of comparison stars. The ‘parallax’ is, in fact, and is becom-
ing more and more generally recognized to be, a differential quantity,
fainter stars being in very many instances much nearer to us than
others possessing incomparably greater brightness. In passing I may
here instance « Lyrw as compared with 61 Cygui; » Centauri as
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 129

compared with « Indi. In fact, the position in space of the faint com-
parison stars in relation to that of the star whose parallax is sought is,
if not a matter of accident, at all events wholly unknown until the ob-
servations and computations are complete.”

Professor Pritchard’s results for stellar parallax, as published in the
third volume of the Oxford Observations, are as follows:

The greater part of this volume is devoted to a discussion of the
parallax of 61 Cygni and the results seem to justify his remark that
‘the four comparison stars probably belong to a remote system not
containing 61 Cygni.” The probable errors deduced are small.

At the annual visitation to the Oxford Observatory on June 12, 1890,
Professor Pritchard announced the results of the determination of
parallaxes of six more stars by the photographic method, as follows:

The subjoined table forms a summary of a paper published in the

which he collects the seattered results for stellar parallax obtained in
the past sixty years. Dr. Oudemans concludes that “stars with proper
motions greater than 6.05 have probably an annual parallax of 0.”10
to 0.50.

In the Bulletin Astronomique for March, 1890, is a most useful cata-
logue, compiled by Bossert, of all stars whose proper motion is known
to exceed 0.50. They are thus distributed :

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS.

Some very elegant and simple formule for determining the true orbit
of a binary star, originally published in Russian, have been brought
out by Professor Glasenapp.

= Scorpii.icHerr Schorr has made a study of the motions in this
triple system by methods similar to those employed by Dr. Seeliger on
‘ Cancri. The star is known as 2 1998, the magnitudes of its compo-
nents being A=3.9, B=5.2, C = 7.2.

7 Ophiuchi has been divided into two nearly equal components by

3urnham with the 36inch Lick telescope, and he thinks that it will
prove to be a binary of short period. He has also found companions
for Aldebaran, 7 Cassiopeiw, and 0 Cygni, and has been able to sepa-
rate and measure a companion to the principal star in the pair « Hydre,
the existence of which was suspected by previous observers.

Photographs of the spectrum of Spica have put beyond question the
reality of its motion in the direction of the line of sight. Dr. Vogel
has deduced from observations of 1889 and 18990 a period of revolution
of about 4 days.

PHOTOMETRY.

The results of observations made with the meridian photometer of
the Harvard observatory by Prof. E. C. Pickering and Mr. Wendell
during the years 1882-1888, have appeared as volume 24 of the Harvard
Annals. The principal work done with this instrument was ‘the de-
termination of the magnitudes of a sufficient number of stars con-
tained in the Durchmusterung, and distributed with approximate uni-
formity, to serve for future estimates or measures of maguitude, and
to enable previous estimates to be reduced to the photometric scale,”
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 131

The number of stars of which observations are recorded is 20,125;
30 that when the stars enumerated in volume 28 of the Annals are reck-
oned, the total number of stars observed reaches 20,982. Measures
have also been made of 166 variable stars and of several planets and
satellites. In the ‘Harvard Photometry” the brightest stars were com-
pared solely with Polaris. In the present observations 4 Urs Minoris
was selected as the standard star, but the results are made to depend
upon a series of 100 circumpolar stars, the magnitudes of which were
frequently determined with the smaller instrument.

Photographic photometry.—The readiest and most effective means of
determining the magnitudes of stars from an examination of the disks
impressed on a sensitized film is a problem that has received much
attention recently, and contributions to the literature of the subject
have been made from the three observatories of Harvard, Stockholm,
and Potsdam.

Professor Pickering gives in volume 18 of the Harvard Annals three
catalogues of magnitudes, embracing, on the whole, some 2,500 stars,
the first catalogue giving the photographic magnitudes of all the stars
brighter than the fifteenth magnitude within 1° of the pole; the second,
the magnitudes of many of the stars in the Pleiades; and the third the
magnitudes of 1,131 stars generally brighter than the eighth magnitude
near the equator.

The contribution from the Potsdam observatory is confined to the
discussion of the magnitudes of stars in the Pleiades as impressed on
plates taken with a chemically corrected object-glass by Dr. Scheiner,
and with the reflecting telescope of the Herény observatory, supple-
mented by some photographs of the artificial stars in a Zollner photom-
eter. The principal results of the inquiry are twofold: first, that the
increase of the diameter of the star disk varies as the square root of
the time of exposure ; and secondly, that a simple linear relation exists
between the observed diameter and the magnitude.

The third contribution to this subject is from Dr. Charlier, of Stock-
holm, who deduces a formula which expresses the connection between
the photographic brillianey of a star and its photographed image in such
a manner as to insure a coincidence as far as possible between the pho-
tographic and photometric magnitudes.

VARIABLE AND COLORED STARS.

Chandler's catalogue of variable stars.—Chandler’s admirable cata-
logue of variable stars has been adopted by Schoenfeld in the ephemer-
ides published in the Vierteljahrsschrift, and it also furnishes the data
for the ephemerides of the Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes and the
Observatory, and is thus formally recognized as the standard authority
ou variables. Mr. Chandler publishes in the Astronomical Journal
(No. 216) three tables supplementary to the catalogue, containing (1) a
list of new variables arranged ay in the original catalogue; (2) a list of
132 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

additions and corrections to the elements of the catalogue; and (3) a
list of stars probably variable, but whose variability needs further con-
firmation before definitive letters can be assigned. The attention of
observers is directed to this list.

Taking his catalogue of 1888 as a basis, Mr. Chandler has made an
investigation of the relation existing between the lengths of the periods
and the number of the variables; their color, range of fluctuation,
forms of light curves, irregularities of periods and of light variations.
Periods under 20 days predominate, while for the long-period stars a
well-marked maximum is indigated about a period of 320 days. With
regard to color, the redder the tint the longer the period; and with
regard to range of fluctuation, while it is probable that there is a de-
pendence of range upon the duration of the period, the relation is not
one of strict proportionality of range to period. It furthermore appears
that the average ratio of increase to decrease for stars with periods less
than 100 days is about 0.65; between 100 and 200 days it is slightly in
excess of unity; it then declines as the periods lengthen ; at first, grad-
ually, but in the neighborhood of a year, with extraordinary sudden-
ness, recovering as quickly until it again exceeds unity in the group of
extremely long periods. In the case of the numerical laws of the per-
turbations of the periods, Mr. Chandler remarks that his researches
are not yet complete, but that, broadly, in the case of long-period vari-
ables, the irregularities are periodic in their nature, and in the case of
those of short period, secular and exceptional.

Algol.—Prof. H. C. Vogel, of Potsdam, has published the results of
some interesting observations of the changes in the spectrum of Algol
at the times of the diminution and recovery of its light. These, whilst
fully confirming the view origimally suggested by Goodricke, that the
periodic variability of this star is caused by the revolution of a dark
companion cutting off part of its light in the manner of an eclipse, and
the calculation of Professor Pickering that the diameter of the compan-
ion amounts to about eight-tenths of that of the principal star, have
enabled Professor Vogel to obtain approximate values of the mutual dis-
tance and actual sizes and masses of the two stars, as well as of their
orbital velocities round their common center of gravity. He finds, in
fact, that their diameters are probably about 1,080,000 and 850,000
English miles respectively; that the distance of their ceuters from each
other amounts to about 3,290,000 miles, and that the orbital velocity of
Algol is about 27, whilst that ofits companion is about 56 miles. The
mass of the former he determines to be about double that of the latter,
the one being approximately four-ninths and the other two-ninths of the
sun’smass. It is not necessary, he remarks, to suppose that the com-
panion is absolutely opaque, but only that its light is very much feeb-
Jer than that of the principal star.

It may be added that the Greenwich observations confirm Dr. Vogel’s
conclusion of the motion of the star in a small orbit,
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. Pao

A remarkable star of the Algol type, having the shortest period
known, was discovered in 1888 by Prof. H. M. Paul, of the U.S. Naval
Observatory. The star is 12 Antliz of Gould’s Uranometria Argentina,
a=9» 26™ 505, 0= — 28° 4.7 (1875.0). The range of magnitude is 6.7 to
7.3, and according to Chandler it goes through its changes in 3" 20™,

From an examination of one of the photographie plates taken by the
Harvard observatory party, at the Chosica station in Peru, Professor
Pickering has announced the discovery of a long-period variable in
Celum of the same class as O Ceti, Rk Hvdre, and R Leonis. The
spectra show bright hydrogen lines.

A number of other new variables have been detected in the exami-
nation of the photographic plates taken at the observatory, and have
been announced by Professor Pickering in the Astronomische Nach-
richten. Some attention has also been paid to this subject by Dr. J.C.
Kapteyn in measuring the plates taken at the Cape of Good Hope for
the formation of Dr. Gill’s photographie southern Durchmusterung, and
also by Mr. Roberts in the prosecution of his work in astronomical pho-
tography.

A general index to observations of variable stars, prepared under
the direction of Prof. E. C. Pickering, forms No. 8 of Vol. 18 of the Har-
vard Annals. A large number of unpublished observations are referred
to, particularly three extensive series of observations by Argelander,
Heis, and Schmidt, to whose manuscripts access was given.

A new edition or rather revision of Birmingham's Red Star Catalogue
has been printed in No. v of the Cunningham Memoirs of the Royal
Irish Academy. The work of revision was undertaken by Rev. T. I.
Espin in 1886, with the 174-inch equatorial reflector, and in the course
of the work a number of new red stars, new variables, and stars with
bright lines in their spectra were discovered. There is also an addi-
tional list of 629 ‘‘ ruddy stars.”

STELLAR SPECTRA.

Spectrum of € Urse Majoris.—Professor Pickering has reported a re-
markably interesting peculiarity in the spectrum of this star. It was
noticed that the K line was double in the photographs taken March 29,
1887, May 17, 1889, and August 27 and 28, 1889, while on many other
dates the line appeared hazy as if the components were slightly sepa-
rated, and at other times the line was well defined and single. It was
concluded that the line was double at intervals of 52 days beginning
March 27, 1887, and it was predicted that the doubling would occur
again on December 9, 1889, and this prediction was confirmed by each
of three photographs on the latter date. Professor Pickering says:

“The only satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon as yet pro-
posed is that the brighter component of this star is itself a double star
having components nearly equal in brightness and too close to have been
Separated as yet visually. Also that the time of revolution of the sys-
134 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

tem is 104 days. When one component is approaching the earth all
the lines in its spectrum will be moved toward the blue end, while all
the lines in the spectrum of the other component will be moved by an
equal amount in the opposite direction if their masses are equal. Each
line will thus be separated into two. When the motion becomes per-
pendicular to the line of sight, the spectral lines recover their true
wave-length and become single.”

From the amount of separation of the lines Professor Pickering con-
cludes that the relative velocity of the two components must be about
100 miles per second. If the orbit is cireular and its plane passes
through the sun, the distance traveled by one component, regarding
the other as fixed, would be 900,000,000 miles, and the distance apart
of the two components would be 143,000,000 miles, or about that of
Mars and the sun. The combined mass would be about forty times
that of the sun to give the required period. :

Several other stars have been found from the Harvard photographs
with a similar doubling of the lines, among them / Aurige and b Ophi-
uchi. For ¢ Aurigze Professor Pickering deduced a period of 4 days,
and his results have been fully confirmed by observations made with
quite different apparatus by Dr. Vogel at Potsdam.

A doubling of the K line in several photographs of the spectrum of
Vega taken by Mr. A. Fowler, apparently indicating that Vega was a
double star of the ¢ Ursz Majoris type, has not been confirmed by the
photographs of Pickering, Vogel, and Henry.

The Henry Draper Memorial.-—The third annual report of Professor
Pickering announces the practical completion of two branches of the
work undertaken, the photographie survey of the spectra of all stars
north of — 25° declination having been effected on a twofold scale, the
one survey including all stars brighter than the seventh magnitude, the
other including stars two magnitudes fainter. The Bache 8-inch doub-
let employed in this work has been transferred to a station near Chos-
ica in Peru and similar surveys for the stars down to the south pole
have been commenced.

The fourth annual report of the Henry Draper Memorial contains as
a frontis piece an engraving showing the periodical duplication of the
K line in the spectrum of 3 Aurigz, the study of which, with other
similar cases has been the most important work of the 11-inch equa-
torial at Harvard. The spectroscopic survey of the brighter stars
in the northern hemisphere (to — 25° declination) is nearly printed
and the work on fainter stars is being satisfactorily pressed. Besides
the spectra, charts of the entire sky are being formed with the same
telescopes. A photographie map of the sky will thus be provided, ap-
proximately on the scale of the Durchmusterung, but including fainter
stars; so far as it has been completed it has proved very convenient
for studying suspected variables and in detecting errors in star cata-
logues.
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 135

Reference should also be made here to the lists of stars with peculiar
spectra detected upon the Harvard Observatory photographie plates
and published from time to time by Professor Pickering in the Astro-
nomische Nachrichten.

A spectroscopic survey of the southern heavens by direct observa-
tion has been undertaken at the Melbourne Observatory. An 8-inch
refracter and the 4-foot reflector will be used in the work.

MOTIONS OF STARS IN THE LINE OF SIGHT.

Dr. Vogel’s interesting results with regard to Algol and other stars
have been alluded to elsewhere. :

Bright lines in stellar spectra.—Mr. Espin has detected bright lines in
the spectra of a number of variables when near their maxima, among
them R Leonis, R Hydra, 7 Cygni, R Andromedie, and S Cassiopcixze
all of Secchi’s third type. Similar lines in the spectra of U and V
Cygni, of the fourth type have been suspected by the Lick observers,
and when these stars were far removed from their maxima. Mr. Keeler
also finds that he is able to break up the apparently continuous spectra
of stars of the type of the Wolf-Rayet stars in Cygnus into an extremely
complicated range of absorption bands and faint bright lines.

A remarkable form of spectrum has been discovered by Professor
Pickering in that of the star Pleione, for the F line consists in this case
of a narrow bright line superposed on a broader dark line, the other
hydrogen lines showing some indications of a similar character.

ASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.

The photographic chart of the heavens.—The permanent committee
appointed by the Astrophotographic Cougress at Paris, in 1887, as noted
in the Review of Astronomy for the years 1887-88, held their first
meeting at the Paris Observatory in September, 1890. The results of
the seven séances are contained in a series of twenty-eight resolutions,
some of the most important of which are mentioned below.

No observatory in the United States appears on this list. A bill was
introduced in Cengress making an appropriation to enable the United
States Naval Observatory to undertake a share of the work, but the
bill failed to become a law.

‘Lhe committee decided that the field of the telescope available for
measurement should be 2° square; that the photographic plates em-
ployed (which are to be of plate glass) should be 160™™ (64 inches)
square and the series of reference lines 130™™ (5 inches) square with
the lines 5"™ apart.

Twelve test objects were selected, all of which are situated near the
equator, at intervals of about two hours of right ascension. In addition
to these, the Pleiades, Prasepe, and a group in Cygnus were selected
for the use of the more northern observatories.

To fix the time of exposure so that the plates shall contain stars to
the eleventh magnitude, it was decided to determine first the time nec-
essary to photograph a star of the 9.0 magnitude of Argelander’s scale,
and thereby multiplying by 6.25 the time of exposure for magnitude
11.0 will be obtained.

Three more numbers (3, 4, and 5) of the Bulletin du Comité Interna-
tional permanent pour lV Exécution Photograpbique de la Carte du Ciel
have been published. Among the many papers contributed to these
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 137

bulletins which have a very important bearing upon astronomical pho-
tography, may be mentioned one by Dr. Bakhuysen on the measure-
ment of the plates by the method of rectangular codrdinates, in which
he obtains star places comparing favorably with those from meridian
observations. Dr. Vogel contributes one or two papers on the “ rés-
eaux ” and the measurement of the plates, and Professor Kapteyn sug-
gests the expediency of taking the catalogue plates with three exposures
at intervals of six months, for the purpose of determining the stars’
proper motions and parallaxes. Dr. Scheiner has an important paper
on the application of photography to the determination of stellar mag-
nitudes.

‘In the fifth number of the Bulletin, Professor Holden has two papers
on the photographic magnitudes of stars, and Mr. Schaeberle one on
the same subject. There is also an abstract of Dr. Lindemann’s photo-
metric determination of the star magnitudes of the Bonn Durchmus-
terung, and a paper by M. Trépied on the necessity of coming to some
understanding as to what is meant by stars of the 9th, 11th, and 14th
magnitudes on the photographic plates.

The question of the reproduction of the plates and of the publication
of the map has been left open, but it is probable that one or more
bureaus will be established for measuring the negatives obtained at
observatories not provided with special apparatus for the purpose, and
photographie copies of all plates will be preserved in selected places in
case of accident to the original negatives.

A meeting of those interested in the various branches of astronomical
photography other than the chart was called by Messrs. Janssen and
Common in September, 1889. The chief matters for discussion being a
complete photographic record of solar phenomena, including solar
spectrum photography; a systematic description of the lunar surface
by photography on a large seale; photographs of pianets and their
satellites, of comets, meteors, and particularly of nebule, clusters, and
of stellar spectra.

In discussing the theory of the photography of a star projected upon
a bright background, Professor Holden cails attention to the fact that
the most important factor is the ratio of the focal length to the aperture
of the objective; generally speaking it would be an advantage to dia-
phragm the objective during the day. This is also true with regard to
ordinary observations during the day, a point of particular importance
in connection with meridian observations.

Authoritative testimony as to the value of photography for obtaining
accurate measures of star clusters is given by Dr. Elkin, who has com-
pared Dr. Gould’s reductions of Rutherfurd’s photographs of the Plei-
ades taken over 20 years ago, with the heliometer measures made at
K6nigsberg and New Haven. The smallness of the probable error Dr.
Elkin regards as proof that in photography we have a means of in-
vestigation for micrometric work at least on a par with any existing
138 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

method, and doubtless far surpassing the present methods in ease of
measurement and output of work.

The Henry Brothers are reported to have made a decided advance
in lunar photography in the plates taken with the equatorial of 0™.32
(12.6 inches) aperture intended for the chart work. The improvement is
attributed especially to the process of enlargement employed, which
makes the diameter of the moon about 1™ (39 inches). This photographic
work is to be continued with the great equatorial coudé, which is soon
to be mounted and provided with a photographie objective.

Mr. Jtoberts has devised a machine, which he calls a ‘“‘ pantograver,”
for measuring the magnitudes of the stars depicted upon the photo-
graphie plates and transferring them to metallic plates for printing.

COMETS.

The origin of comets.—Dr. Bredichin, the present director ef the Pul-
kowa Observatory, who has devoted much time to the study of comet-
ary phenomena, has expressed the opinion that periodic comets owe their
origin to the segmentation of ordinary parabolic comets, having been
thrown off from the latter by an eruption such as it is generally sup-
posed we have witnessed in the great comet of 1882, and earlier in
Biela’s comet. Dr. Kreutz’s monograph on this great September comet
of 1882 forms one of the most important of recent contributions to com-
etary literature. The formidable obstacles to an accurate determination
of its orbit presented by the disintegration of the nucleus into several
points of condensation seem to have been most skillfully surmounted
by the computer. His final value for the period of revolution is 772.2
years.

Dr. Holetschek claims that the systematic grouping of cometary peri-
helia in certain directions (270° and 90° of heliocentric longitude) has
no connection with the general motion of the solar system in space,
but is due to the position of the earth at the time that such discoveries
are most readily made.

An important paper on the capture theory of comets will be found
in the Bulletin Astronomique for June, 1889, and in the same journal for
December, 1890, M. Tisserand has a further contribution to the same
subject.

The Observatory for August, 1889, has a useful table of the approxi-
mate positions atthe time of discovery of all comets seen since 1869,
with brief notes on the physical appearance of each. Mr. Denning, who
has compiled this table, proposes to supplement it by one with similar
data for the comets from 1840 to 1868.

Brorsen’s comet.—A careful search for Brorsen’s comet, which passed
perihelion in 1890, was made by Brooks and Swift, but without effect.
This comet was discovered in 1846, and was last seen in 1879; it could
not be seen at the return in 1884. Tempel’s second comet, and Bar-
nard’s comet 1884 II, were also expected to return to perihelion in
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 139

1890, but were unfavorably situated for observation and escaped de-
tection.

Comets of 1889 and 1890.—W. R. Brooks reported the discovery, on
the morning of January 15, 1889, of a faint comet in Sagittarius, and to
it the designation Comet a 1889 was given, as the first comet discovered
during the year. A careful search for the object was made by a num.
ber of observers, especially by Barnard and Swift, but without success.
As the three observations necessary for determining the orbit were not
secured, the comet is not catalogued with those of the year. A comet
announced by Swift on July 15, 1889, is also omitted, as it proved to be
identical with the comet discovered by Brooks on August 7, 1888.
(1888 IIT).

A phenomenon reported at Grahamstown, South Africa, on the 27th of
October,1890,should be mentioned in connection with the notes on comets.
It was described as a bright band one-fourth of a degree wide and 30°
longitude, afterwards increasing to 90°. At one end it looked like the
head of a comet, while the other end faded out gradually. Its motion
was extraordinary, as it swept over more than 100° in less than 1" 15",

The comets for the years 1889 and 1890, with their final designations,
in the order of perihelion passage are as follows:

Comet 1889 I: | The first comet of 1889, in the order of perihelion

= Comet e 1888. passage, was that discovered by Barnard at the
Lick Observatory with a 4-inch comet-seeker on September 2, 1888, or
the morning of September 3. It was also independently discovered by
Brooks, at Geneva, New York, on the following morning. At the end
of November, and as late as January 4, 1889, it was visible to the naked
eye. Perihelion was passed on January 31, 1889, and by that time,
the comet disappeared in the sun’s rays. The first observations after
conjunction were made about May 24, and it was followed till its light
was again overpowered by that of the sun, Jate in October, 1889, its
appearance being about the same as before perihelion, small, round,
quite bright, and with a short tail. The orbit seems to be hyperbolic.

Barnard remarked on June 3 that there was an anomalous tail directly
following the comet, about 1° in length and some 2’ or 3’ broad, a phe-
nomenon which, according to Bredichin, was probably an effect of per-
spective.

The comet was observed again at the Lick Observatory by Barnard
August 17, 1890, although its distances from the earth and sun were
then, respectively, 6.0 and 6.5 in terms of the earth’s mean distance.
‘The later observations confirm the hyperbolic character of the orbit.
Comet 1889 II: | On the evening of March 31, 1889, E. E. Barnard

Obser’ vatory, a Sho small and slender comet, with a tail 15’ long. By
the end of April it was lost in the evening twilight, reappearing again,
with extremely slow geocentric motion, about July 25, and remaining
visible to November 21. The great perihelion distance of this comet is

140 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

especially noteworthy, amounting to 24 times the distance of the earth
from the sun, a distance which seems to have been surpassed in the
catalogue of comets only by comet 1885 IT, with a perihelion of 25, and
the comet of 1729, with perihelion distance 4.

Jomet 1889 LIL: Mr. Barnard discovered another comet at about

= Comet ¢ 1589. 2 o’elock on the morning of June 24, in the con-
stellation Andromeda, At the time of discovery the comet was only
three days past peribelion. It was then very faint and rapidly became
still fainter, being last observed on August 6. The elements computed
by Berberich show considerable ellipticity in the orbit, the period of
revolution being 128 years.

Comet 1889 IV: A tolerably bright comet was discovered with the
=Comete 1899. | naked eye by Mr. J. Ewen Davidson at Brans-

combe, Mackay, Queensland (latitude — 21° 9/ south), on July 19. It
had a sharp, stellar nucleus, and a tail 30’ long; in a photograph
taken by Barnard at the Lick Observatory on July 30, the tail could be
followed still farther, to a distance of almost 1° from the head. A second
tail was reported by Kammermann, of Geneva, on the 17th of August,
and a segmentation of the nucleus by Ricco about a week earlier.

Professor Holden finds that the brightest part of the tail was 7),
of the brightness of the brightest part of the solar corona during the
eclipse of January 1, 1889, and goadoo05 that of the full moon.

The comet was followed in the northern hemisphere to about the end
of the year.

The spectrum according to the Lick and Palermo observations in
July and August showed no peculiarity; the carbon bands, and the
continuous spectrum of the nucleus, alone being recorded.

Comet 1889 V: | William R. Brooks, of Geneva, New York, while
—=Comet d 1589. | sweeping in the southwestern sky on the morning

of July 6, 1889, detected a suspicious looking nebulous object, the com-
etary character of which he was able to confirm on the following
morning; it was then faint, of about 11th magnitude, a diameter of 1’,
stellar nucleus, and tail 10’ long. The comet attracted no especial
attention from astronomers till August 1, when Barnard discovered
that it had two small and nebulous companions, and on the morning
following it was evident that these two objects were moving with the
parent comet through space. Mr. Barnard says:

“On August 3 they were examined with the 36-inch equatorial, which
showed the whole group very beautifully. Each of the companions had
a very small nucleus and condensation in a very small head and a short
faint tail, presenting a perfect miniature of the larger one, which was
pretty bright and well developed, with small nucleus and slightly fan-
shaped tail 4° long. There was then absolutely no nebulous connection
with the larger, nor has there been at any time since, either in the 12-
inch or in the 36-inch telescope. Nothing whatever has been seen here
of the nebulous envelope spoken of by the Vienna observers as appar-

ently inclosing the whole group (A. N., 2914). I have from the first
carefully looked for a nebulous connection. Under unfavorable circum-
stances the tails of B and C might be imagined to be a connecting neb-
ulosity, but the tail of b falls short of A, and that of C does not nearly
reach B. Each comet is in appearance absolutely independent of the
other. The tails of all three have lain in the line of the nucleus of A,
and therefore have not sensibly deviated, from the position-angle 241°.”

‘On August 4, two other companions were detected with the great
telescope, one of which was measured, the other being too elusive to
set the wire on. I have numbered these four companions Bb, C, D, H,
in theaorder of increasing right ascension, A being the larger comet, D
and E being the two last discovered. D has been seen several times
since the moon withdrew, but has always been too faint to observe. It
has not sensibly changed its position. E has only been seen onee. Its
position angle referred to C would be the same as that of D, and its
distance twice as great. Four or five other nebulous bodies observed
near the comet, August 2, have not since been seen, and were probably
nebulous.

‘¢The results of the observations of the two brighter companions are
extremely interesting. Measures of B have been made on eighteen, and
of C on seventeen nights. These two have almost exactly the same
position-angles, which have been sensibly constant. Their distances
from the main body have, however, been increasing. At the last ob-
servations, B seems to be stationary, the distance from A remaining
constant, while C continues to recede.”

Mr. Chandler’s investigation of the orbit of this comet has devel-
oped a strong probability that it is identical with a comet discovered
by Messier in 1770, often called Lexell’s lost comet, because that
astronomer calculated that it was moving in an elliptic orbit with a
period of about 54 years, though it was not seen afterwards. itis now
well known that this was due to the fact that at the return in 1776
its position was such as to render any observation impossible, and
before another return could take place the comet made in 1779 so
close an approach to the planet Jupiter as completely to change
the nature of the orbit. Mr. Chandler finds that Brooks’s comet also
made a near approach to Jupiter, so near, in fact, on May 20, 1886, that
it was only about nine diameters of Jupiter distant, or only a little
outside the orbit of his third satellite. Calculation of the elements of
the comet orbit before this appulse leads to the conclusion that they
present a great similarity to those of Lexell’s comet after its approach
to the planet in 1779, rendering the probability great that the bodies
are identical. Mr. Chandler shows that no similar serious disturbance
willoccuragain until 1921, so that appearances may be looked for in 1896,
1903, 1910, and 1917, at each of which return the condition of visibility
will be favorable, giving opportunities for further investigations into
the motions of this interesting comet, which, it appears, narrowly

escaped being converted into a fifth satellite of Jupiter. Mr. Barnard
succeeded in finding and observing the comet again, on the night of
November 21, 1890, with the 36-inch Lick telescope, eight months after
it had been given up as beyond reach ; and when its distance from the
earth was 3.09, and from the sun 3.55.

the dispatch received by him, and immediately perceived a very faint
comet, but concluding from the description that Zona’s was brighter, by
turning the telescope a little he found the latter, physical connection
between the two being excluded by the slower motion of his own. The
period appears to be about 6.4 years.

METEORS.

* See Astronomical Journal, Nos. 212 and 238.

A valuable résumé of meteoric astronomy has been published by Prof.
J. kh. Eastman in the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washing.
ton, (Vol. x1.) Abstracts of the various theories propounded in ex-

planation of meteors are given, and extensive catalogues of observed
meteors and meteorites.

Mr. Denning pointed out several years ago that there were a number
of meteor streams in which the meteors seemed to radiate from the same
point in the sky for a period of three months or more. The ouly expla-
nation of this phenomenon seemed to be that the meteors were moving
with frightful velocity through space, but M. Tisserand, from a mathe-
matical study of the problem, shows that these meteors do not all
come from the same stream; they may perhaps belong to a family pre-
senting certain common characteristics, but they are in reality different
streams accidentally falling together, a not very improbable assumption
considering the great number of meteor streams and the difficulty of
determining the radiant with any degree of precision.

Mr. Denning does not, however, admit that an accidental coincidence
of radiant points of different streams is a sufficient explanation of the
phenomena he has observed.

THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.—Prof. Arthur Searle, who has made a special
study of the zodiacal light, finds that the permanence of the ordinary
western light, subject only to slight variations in the degree of visi-
bility, isconfirmed by the observations of the last 50 years at the Hanaud
Observatory. The zodiacal bands, which are said to form a prolong-
ation of the ordinary zodiacal light, were not seen, though stellar or
nebulous bands, one extending from Aquila to the Pleiades, and the
second from Priaesepe to Coma Berenices have been noticed and perhaps
offer an explanation of the zodiaeal bands. The Gegenschein, it is sug-
gested, may be due to a maximum of light reflected from the meteoric
matter scattered in the solar system.

The observations of Prof. C. Michi Smith, carried on at intervals
since 1875 indicate a periodic appearance of the line at wave-length 553
in the zodiacal light spectrum ; a line differing but little in wave-length
from the auroral line (wave-length 556.7).

PLANETS.

A very laborious work is being carried on in the office of the Ameri-
can Ephemeris, under the superintendence of Professor Neweomb—the
re-determination of the elements of all the larger planets. Professor
Neweomb’s plan ineludes the re-reduction of the older planetary obser-
vations and the discussion of the later ones, with a view of reducing
them all to a uniform system. Another branch of this planetary work
is a determination of the mass of Jupiter from the motions of Poly-
hymnuia, and a comparison of Hansen’s tables of the moon with observed
occultations since 1750.

The first volume of this series of memoirs upon the theories of the
major planets has appeared in the ‘Astronomical Papers,” of the
American ephemeris, being a new disenssion of Jupiter and Saturn by
Hill. He has determined the complete analytical expressions for the
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 145

coérdinates of these two planets, giving also a provisional comparison of
his theory with observations. The method followed is in general that
of Hansen.

In commenting upon recent determinations of planetary masses from
the motions of comets, Professor Hall says

“The objection to deducing values of planetary masses from the
motions of comets consists, I think, in the fact that apparently other
forces than that of gravitation act on these bodies. As a comet ap-
proaches the sun it changes form, disintegrates, and matter is thrown
off to form a tail. Until we know more of the theory of these changes
the computation of masses from the motions of comets and inferences
about the resisting medium in space must be uncertain.”

MeERcuRY.—The observations of Schroter early in the present cen-
tury indicated that Mercury had a motion of rotation about its axis of

_ about 24 hours. Subsequent observers failed, however, to confirm his

) 2 : 2 :
/ observations, and the question of Mercury’s rotation has generally been

Pa

abi 7 a

regarded as one of the unsettled problems of astronomy. M. Schiapa-
relli, taking advantage of the clear sky of Milan, has observed Mercury
since 1881, obtaining about one hundred and fifty sketches, showing
quite well-marked spots, from which he has deduced a rotation period
of 85 days, the same, in fact, as the period of rotation of the planet
around the sun. Schiaparelli also concludes that the axis of rotation
must be nearly perpendicular to the orbit of the planet, the rotation

being uniform.

Dr. von Herdtl has obtained the following values for the mass of
Mercury :
I. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,012,842 from Winnecke’s comet.
II. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,514,700 Le Verrier’s equation modified.
III. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,648,600 Encke’s comet, 1819-1868.
IV. Mass of Mercury, 1: 5,669,700 Encke’s comet, 1¥71-1885.

VENUS.—Schiaparelli has concluded, from an exhaustive rediseussion
of all the older observations, combined with his own observations of
1877 and 1878, that Venus rotates upon its axis in 225 days, or the same
time that it rotates about the sun, contrary to the generally received
hypothesis that its rotation period is about 23 hours. Venus, then, as
well as Mercury, would seem to turn always the same face to the sun,
as the moon turns the same face to the earth.

THE HARTH— Variation of latitude.—The subject of the change of ter-
restrial latitudes, to which allusion has been made in previous reports,
continues to receive considerable attention from astronomers and
geographers. The following results have been obtained by Dr. Kiist-
ner, in continuation of his former researches, from 7 pairs of stars at
three different times of the year:

Epoch. Latitude of Berlin.
1884. 32 +-52° 30’ 167.73—0.82 4 A
1884. 70 16.964 0.83 4 A
1885. 31 167,52—0.55 Jd A
G. Mis, 129 10

146 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890

where J A represents the correction to the assumed constant of aber-
ration. The direct inference from these figures is that in 7 months
the latitude of Berlin decreased 0.44. Pulkowa showed about the
same time a similar change:

Epoch. Latitude of Pulkowa
1882. 51 -++59° 46/ 18.52
1883. 51 18.54
1834, 70 18.63
1885. 23 18.31
1885. 31 18’’.30

a decrease of 0.33 from 1884.70 to 1885.51.

The general agreement of these results certainly calls for further
investigation ; and to test the matter Mr. Preston has been sent out by
the U. S. Coast Survey, and Dr. Marcuse by the International Geodetic
Commission, to Honolulu, which is at the opposite end of the earth’s
diameter from Berlin, and by simultaneous observations at these two
stations if is hoped the question will be settled.

It is quite possible that the origin of the apparent change at Berlin
in 1884-1885 is meteorological, a view to which Dr. Foerster inclined in
bringing the matter before the Association Géodésique in 1888, The
whole question is, then, whether there are changes in the disposition of
atmospheric strata sufficient to account for the facts observed, or the
axis of rotation and the axis of inertia of the earth are not sensibly
coincident.

A complete résumé of the subject is given by M. Tisserand in the
Bulletin Astronomique for September, 1890.

Mr. Ricco has experimented with a somewhat novel demonstration of
the rotundity ot the earth. At the observatory of Palermo, which is
situated at a distance of 14 miles from the Mediterranean and 236 feet
above its level, a great number of photographs of the sun reflected from
the surface of the water have been taken afew minutes after rising or
before setting. and they show that the diameter in the plane of reflee-
tion is less in the reflected image than in thedirect. This deformation
is due to the fact that the surface of the water forms a cylindrical
mirror, with axis horizontal and normal to the plane of reflection. The
amount of the observed flattening accords well with that demanded by
theory.

Standard time—The introduction of the system of standard time,
which has been found of such practical usefulness in the United States,
has been quietly agitated in other countries for several years past, and
a well-written article upon the subject by Dr. Robert Schram will be
fonnd in the Observatory for April, 1890. The adoption of a uniform
time system, the time of the fifteenth meridian east of Greenwich, has
been very favorably looked upon in Austria and Germany for railroad
purposes,
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 147

Of the proposed change of the beginning of the astronomical day from
midday to the preceding midnight nothing has been heard since the
original agitation of the subject at the time of the Meridian Conference
at Washington in 1884.

The moons physical libration.—Dr. Julius Franz of the Konigsberg
observatory has done an excellent piece of work in bringing to light
and discussing (vol. 38, K6nigsberg Beobachtungen) the observations
of the moon made by Schliiter, an assistant of Bessel’s, in 1841-1843,
the work having been undertaken by Schliiter under the immediate
supervision of his distinguished chief. The observations were continued
by Wichmann after Schliiter’s death, buf Wichmann was never able to
do more than to reduce his own observations for preliminary results to.
be used in a discussion of all the material available.

Dr. Franz recommends the substitution of observations of the spot
Mosting A for those of the limbs, in determining the moon’s place, a
method upon which a report was published by the late Dr. C. H. F.
Peters in the U. S. Coast Survey volume for 1856.

Temperature of the moon.—A memoir on the temperature of the moon
by Mr. S. P. Langley forms a part of the fourth volume of the publica-
tions of the National Academy of Sciences, and is re-published in a some-
what abbreviated form in the American Journal of Science for Decein-
ber, 1889. The paper may be regarded as the completion of a piece of
work commenced in 1883, and represented by papers read in 1884 and
1856, as well as the present one. The principal conclusion drawn is
‘‘that the mean temperature of the sunlit lunar soil is much lower than
has been supposed, and is most probably not greatly above zero centi-
grade.” The principle by which this temperature is estimated is that
the position of the maximum in a curve, representing invisible radiant
heat of different wave-lengths, furnishes a criterion as to the tempera-
ture of the radiating solid body. In the lunar spectrum two distinct
heat maxima are found—one corresponding to radiation reflected from
the soil, the other to that emitted by it (when warmed by sunshine).
The determination of the second inaximum with accuracy would give
an accurate value for the temperature of the sunlit soil; but, unfortu-
nately, the absorption-bands produced by the earth’s atmosphere ob-
scure this maximum, and render the conclusions somewhat uncertain ;
so that Professor Langley is compelled to state his principal conclu-
sion in a guarded manner, as above quoted.

The Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Beene
(vol. 24) contains an account of some measures of lunar radiation made
by Mr. C. C. Hutchins, by means of a new thermograph which he has
devised. This instrument consists of a single thermal junction of nickel
and iron placed in the focus of a small concave mirror, and is found to
be much more sensitive than a thermopile of forty-eight couples. The
measures of lunar radiation were made with an arrangement similar to
that of a Herschel’s telescope with the thermograph in place of an eye
148 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

piece, the conclusion reached being that the heat which the earth re-
ceives from the moon is to that from the sun as f is to 184,560, From
observations during the eclipse of January 28, 1588, Mr. Hutehins infers
that all but a minute portion of the rays from the lunar soil and roek
are cut off by our atmosphere, as it seems impossible that a surface
like that of the moon, upon which the sun has been shining for many
days, should suddenly cease to radiate when the sun’s light is with-
drawn.

MArs.—Durin gthe opposition of 1890 Mars again received special
attention from the Lick observers. Experiments were tried with colored
glasses, with diminished apertures, ete., all with small suecess. Many
photographs were also secured, but none that were pronounced satis-
factory. The mystery of the ‘*canals” is still further increased by the
fact that while Professor Holden and Mr. Keeler always saw the canals
as dark, broad, somewhat diffused bands, and Mr. Schaeberle saw them
in the same way when the seeing was bal, but under good condi-
tions described them as narrow lines a second of are or so in width.
On April 12 Mr. Schaeberle saw two of the canals doubled, thereby
verifying Professor Schiaparelli’s observations. The positions of most
of the canals have also been verified by some of the Lick astronomers.

JUPITER.— Mr. J. i. Keeler pablishes in the monthly notices for No-
vember a drawing of Jupiter made with the Lick 36-inch on the night of
August 28,1890. The great red spot is described as being of about the
same dimensions as in 1889, with a dark shading at its following end,
but the middle whiter and the arrangement of belts somewhat different.
“It would seem, on the whole, that the surface features of Jupiter in-
dicate less activity in the internal forces of the planet than was man-
ifest a year ago.”

Barnard and Burnham have reported a very curious doubling of the
first satellite as seen with the 12-inch equatorial of the Lick observ-
atory. Of this phenomenon there seems to be but two possible explana-
tions: either there is a white belt on the satellite parallel to the belts of
Jupiter or the satellite is actually double.

M. Belopolsky has brought out from an examination of drawings of
Jupiter a peculiar variation in the time of rotation (first noted by Cas-
sini) with the latitude. A velocity of 9" 51" was found in the zone 0°
to 5° in both hemispheres, and a time of rotation of 9° 55.5™ for the re-
inainder of the surface, both hemispheres, except between 5° and 10°
of north and south latitude, where the two velocities appear to occur
with equal frequency.

SATURN.—A peculiar white spot on the rings of Saturn attracted con-
siderable attention in the early part of 1889. This spot was first seen
by Dr. Terby, of Louvain, on March 6, 1889, who reported it as adjacent
to the shadow of the ball and similar to the white spots sometimes seen
upon Jupiter; on March 12 it was again seen with an 8 inch Clark tel-
escope, but on the Loth, 20th, 22d, and 25d, and on April 2, it was
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 149

invisible. While several observers confirmed Dr. Terby’s discovery,
nothing to correspond sufficiently with his description could be made
out by others, though provided with much more powerful apparatus.
Professor Hall has expressed the opinion that it was an optical effect
of contrast. i

The very fine division of the outer ring detected with the 36-inch Lick
refractor early in 1885 was again seen in 1889 at a distance of about
one-sixth of the breadth of ring A from its outer edge. A dark shad-
ing extended inwards from the new division almost to the inner edge of
thering. Professor Holden has noted also an extremely narrow brighter
polar cap about 5 seconds ‘of are wide, in a direction parallel to the
equator, and perpendicular to this about the width of the Cassini divi-
sion at the anse.

An interesting monograph on Saturn, the result of fourteen years
work, is contributed by Prof. Asaph Hall as Appendix I1 to the Wash-
ington Observations, 1885. The characteristic of this memoir is great
caution, and the three drawings of the planet, where a few scanty
markings represent all that Professor Hall can certainly see with a
fine telescope, should re-assure those who have been dissatisfied with
their modest instruments beeause they could not therewith recognize
the elaborate detail described by more imaginative observers. To
quote the author’s own words: ‘‘The appearance of Saturn in our
26-inch refractor undergoes great changes from night to night, and
sometimes even from hour to hour during the same night. Probably
these changes are due to variations in our own atmosphere and in the
action of the objective, and they do not therefore indicate real changes
in the planet. Whenever we have a steady and transparent atmos-
phere, the outlines of the planet, the faint belts and markings on the
ball, the shadow of the ball on the ring, the dusky ring, and the Cassini
division are clear and distinct, and the abnormal phenomena sometimes
seen are not visible. Without exception, my experience is that on
good nights the planet always has this natural appearance. But on
poor nights, when the image is blazing and unsteady, one can see and
imagine many strange things about this wonderful object.”

Professor Hall finds for the rotation period of the planet from obser-
vations of the white spot (1876, December 7 to 1877, January 2) 10"
14™ 23°. 8 + 2°.3 mean time (see Astron. Nachr. No. 2146). Careful
discussions are also given of the position and dimensions of the ring.

The notch in the outline of the shadow was never seen at Washing-
ton, either by Professor Hall or his assistant. ‘The curvature of the
outline of the shadow presented an anomaly in 1876 when the convexity
appeared to be turned towards the ball, contrary to what we should
expect from geometrical considerations. The notes show that some-
thing of this kind was seen after the re-4ppearance of the ring in 1878.
After the ring was well opened, the curvature of the outline always

appeared natural or turned away from the ball.” (Observatory.)
150 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, ‘1890.

The last determination of the thickness of Saturn’s ring, as Professor
Hall has pointed out, was made in 1848 by W. C. Bond, who found
that it was less than 0.01; Duséjour estimated its thickness at 0./72,
and Schroeter at 0.13. At the disappearance of the ring in Septein-
ber and October, 1891, the conditions of observation are not very
favorable, a better opportunity occurring in 1892.

In connection with the approaching disappearance of the ring, an
account of observations made by M. E. lL. Trouvelot upon the passage
of the sun and earth through the plane of the rings in 1877~78 is of
especial interest.

Saturn’s satellites—Dr. Hermann Struve has published the second
installment of his work on the theory of Saturn’s satellites. In this he
discusses the orbits of Mimas and Enceladus, and their connection with
the other satellites, and he has been able to account satisfactorily for
the large corrections to the computed position of Mimas required
during the past few years. In his previous paper Dr. Struve was led
to assume a sensible mass for the ring-system of Saturn, but he now
concludes that this hypothesis must be rejected, the mass of the ring
being so small that the terms to which it would independently give
rise in the disturbing function are as yet undetected by observation.

A determination of the orbit of Titan and the mass of Saturn, the
result of several years’ work with the Yale observatory heliometer, is
published by Mr. Asaph Hall, jr., in the Transactions of the Yale
Observatory, 1889. His value for Saturn’s mass is 1:3500.5 + 1.44,
agreeing well with Bessel’s value 1: 3502, and that obtained by Struve
1:3498.

UrANuS.—Dr. Huggins has found evidence of solar lines in the photo-
graphic spectrum of Uranus, with an exposure of two hours (June 3,
1889). All the principal solar lines were seen, but no others either
bright or dark. Mr. Taylor, on the other hand, bas reported bright
flutings seen with a direct vision spectroscope attached to the five foot
reflecter of Common’s observatory, Ealing, and if this observation is
confirmed it will of course prove that the planet is at least in part self-
luminous.

THE MINOR PLANETS.

The discovery of additional members of the zone of asteroids goes
on without the least signs of abatement, and the number has now
reached 301, no fewer than 6 having been found in 1889, and 14 in 1890,
Twice during 1890 (April 25 and September 9) two were discovered on
the same evening by the same observer; and the two discovered by
Palisa on April 25 were independently discovered by Charlois on the
following evening, April 26. ;

An asteroid discovered by Charlois, November 14, 1890, and supposed
by him to be 298 (discovered September 9), proved to be not identical
with the latter. Consequently it takes the number 302.

SOLAR SYSTEM.

Prof. Lewis Boss has made a new determination of the amount and
direction of the solar motion based upon a list of 253 stellar proper
motions derived from the Albany zone observations. Professor Boss
considers, as the most probable result from these data, that the apex of
the sun’s way isin right ascension 18" 40™ ; declination +409, or not far
from the star Vega.

Herr Oscar Stumpe, of Borm, has made a new determination of the
direction of the solar motion from the proper motions of 1,054 stars,
which he divides into four groups, according to the magnitudes of their
proper motions in a great circle. He thus obtains four different values
of the apex of the sun’s way, all agreeing in locating that point in the
constellation Lyra, or in the adjacent part of Cygnus.

Prof. J. R. Eastman, in an address as president of the Philosphical
Society of Washington, has given an analysis of the investigations to
determine the apex of the sun’s motion and its velocity of translation.
He shows that, contrary to the ordinarily accepted belief, faint stars are
nearer us than bright stars; a result also shown by the list of stellar
parallaxes recently published by Oudemaus.
152 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.
SUN.

Rotation of the sun.—Mr. Crew, whose observations of the rotation
of the sun were noted in a previous summary, has made a new se:
ries of observations for the correction or confirmation of his conclu-
sion that the angular velocity of rotation increased with an increase
of latitude. He still finds shorter rotation periods for the higher lati-
tudes, the mean value for the period at latitude 45° being 18 hours
shorter than at the equator, though owing to the smallness of this
amount and the uncertainty of the observations he is of the opinion that
“no certain variation of period with latitude has been detected with
the spectroscope.” Attention is called however to the wide differences
of the equatorial period as obtained by different methods, differences
which may be due to the fact that we are really dealing with different
strata of the sun, though here also much reliance must not be placed
upon the observations.

Spectroscopic observations made by Dunér for determining the rota-
tion time of the sun, confirm the slowing down of the time of rotation
with an increase of heliocentric latititude, quite contrary to the result
recently obtained by Wilsing. <A period of 25.46 days is deduced for
the sidereal rotation at the equator, and 38.54 days for that at latitude
74.89,

Diameter of the sun.—Dr. Auwers discusses, in the third memoir on the
diameter of the sun, communicated to the Berlin Academy, the observa-
tions at Greenwich by Maskelyne and his assistants from 1765 to 1810,
Curious differences of personal equation between different observers are
brought out. Instead of Maskelyne’s observations giving progressively
smaller values of the sun’s diameter during his whole observing life, as
has hitherto been supposed, Dr. Auwers’s very exhaustive discussion
indicates that after the first two years (which gave a very large value)
the observed diameter remained nearly constant for the period 1767-
1772, then during the years 1772-1790 the diameter was continually
decreasing, lastly from 1790-1810 the observations gave a diameter con-
tinually increasing. The minimum value in 1790 was 31 58’.13—about
1” smaller than the value obtained from modern heliometer measures.

Spoeren’s researches on sun spots.— Professor Spoerer, who has devoted
much attention not only to the current state of the solar activity, but
also to the early records of sun spots, published early in 1889 two im-
portant papers on the results of his researches in the latter field. The
two papers are entitled respectively, Ueber die Periodicitat der Sonnen-
Jlecken seit dem Jahre 1618, communicated to the Royal Leopold-Caro-
line Academy, and Sur les différences que présentent Vhémisphére nord et
Vhémisphere sud du Soleil, appearing in the number of Bulletin Astrono-
mique tor February, 1889. The conelusions arrived at in these two
papers nay be summarized under the three following heads:

First: These earlier observations afford us many examples of the
operation of the ‘law of zones;” that is to say, a little before a mini-
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 153

miim spots are only seen in low latitudes, at about the time of mini-
mum spots near the equator cease to appear, while a fresh series of
spots break out a great distance from it, and thenceforward to the
next minimum the mean heliographic latitude of the spots tends to
decline continuously, until at length spots are again seen only in the
vicinity of the equator. ‘This law held good, Professor Spoerer shows,
for the minima of 1619, 1755, 1775, 1784, 1833, and 1844, and to some
extent for that of 1645.

Second: Though in general a predominance of spots for a time in
one hemisphere is sooner or later balanced by a corresponding predom-
inance in the other, this is not always the case, and Professor Spoerer
calls attention to three periods in which the southern hemisphere was
decidedly the more prolific. The first was from 1621 to 1625, there be-
ing no northern spots in 1621 and 1622, and but few in the three fol-
lowing years. Another is the present period, for from 1883 to the pres-
ent time the southern spots have been nearly twice as numerous as the
northern. But the third was the most remarkable, tor from 1672 to
1704 we have no record of any northern spots at all; and Cassini and
Maraldi expressly declared, on the appearance of a northern spot in
1705, that they did not recollect ever to have observed a spot in that
hemisphere before. Northern spots continued to be infrequent until
1714.

Third: For a period of about seventy years, ending in 1716, there
seems to have been a very remarkable interruption of the ordinary
course of the spot cycle. In several years no spots appear to have
been seen at all, and in 1705 it was recorded as a most remarkable
event that two spots were seen on the sun at the same time, for a sim-
ilar circumstance had scarcely ever been seen during the sixty years
previous. So far as the observations go, the “law of zones” also seems
to have been in abeyance, for no regular drift was apparent, the mean
latitude being low—about 8° or 9°—during the entire time.

Professor Spoerer is still continuing his researches into ancient sun-
spot records, and hopes to be able to examine the manuscripts of Plant-
ade (1705-1726) and of Flaugergues (1794-1830). (E. W. M. Monthly
Notices R. A. 8S., February, 1890).

Attention should be directed to a paper in the Monthly Notices for
December, 1890, by Rev. A. L. Cortie, S. J., on the sun-spot observa-
tions made at Stonyhurst in the years 1882-89.

A comparison of sun-spot statistics for 1878 with the records of 1889
gives a sun-spot period of exactly 11 years, and it seems probable that
the real minimum occurred about the end of 1889. This probability is
increased by the appearance on March 4, 1890, of a large spot in helio-
graphic latitude +349, which during its period of visibility in a semi-
rotation of the sun passed within one-sixth of the sun’s diameter from
its northern edge. During the whole of the year 1889 the southern
hemisphere of the sun manifested greater activity than the northern;
154 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

protuberances were seen, according to Tacchini, in both hemispheres at
high latitudes where there were neither spots nor faculie; there were
also zones with spots and without facule.

Mr. Lockyer has presented a second report to the Solar Physics com-
mittee on the observations of sun-spot spectra made at South Kensing-
ton. He finds that the observations (to February, 1888) confirm the
conclusion which he arrived at in 1886, that ‘as we pass from minimum
to maximum the lines of the chemical elements gradually disappear
from among those most widened, their places being taken by lines of
which we have at present no terrestrial representatives.

SOLAR SPECTRUM.

Thollon’s chart of the solar spectrum.—In 1879 Thollon presented to
the Académie des Sciences a map of the solar spectrum, extending from
A to H, made with his great spectroscope. His work was renewed with
more perfect apparatus, but on account of the great labor of the under-
taking he confined himself to the region from A to b; this was pre-
sented to the Academy in 1885, and gained the Lalande prize. Thollon
continued this work until his death, and it has now been published in
33 maps with a total length of 10".23 (53.6 feet), and contains about 3,200
lines, between the limits ado pted, A and b, the positions of which were
determined from 252 sharp lines adopted as “ fundamentals.”

Thollon made special efforts to distinguish the telluric ravs from those
entirely due to the sun; and with this end in view he observed the sun
at different altitudes, noting the hygrometric conditions of the air. Of
these 3,200 lines mapped, 2,090 were of solar origin, 866 telluric, and
246 mixed, that is to say resulting from the superposition of telluric and
solar lines. The breadth and intensity of each line is given upon an
arbitrary scale.

M. Bigourdan, in a review of Thollon’s work, published in the May
number of the Bulletin Astronomique, says that for the part of the spec-
trum studied no work is comparable with that of Thollon except the
magnificent photographs of Rowland, and he finds upon a critical com-
parison of different regions of considerable extent that Rowland’s pho-
tographs contain no lines not upon Thollon’s chart, though the faintest
lines given upon the chart are frequently lacking in the photographs.
Between wave-lengths 5,262 and 5,337, for example, in Rowland’s pho-
tograph, there are not half the number of lines that there are upon
Thollon’s chart, though it is probable that the original negatives would
not show so large a difference.

Rowland’s determination of elements in the sun.—Professor Rowlands
examination by photography of the spectra of 58 elements and their com-
parison with the spectrum of the sun shows the existence in the sun of
35 differeut elements ; the existence of 8 more in the sun is doubtful,
while of 10 he finds no trace. The element represented by the greatest
number of lines is iron, there being 2,000 or more lines in the spectrum

D
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 155

of iron found also in the solarspectrum. Iron is followed by nickel, titan-
jum, manganese, chromium, cobalt, carbon, with decreasing frequency of
coincidences, ending with lead and potassium, for which but one line is
found in common with the sun.

The full list of elements in the sun, arranged according to the inten-
sity and the number of lines in the solar spectrum, is as follows:

Professor Rowland says: ‘ With the bigh dispersion here used
the ‘basic lines’ of Lockyer are widely broken up and cease to exist.
Indeed it would be difficult to prove anything except accidental coinci-
dences among the lines of the different elements. Accurate investiga-
tion generally reveals some slight difference of wave length or a com-
mon impurity. furthermore, the strength of the lines in the solar
156 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

spectrum is generally very nearly the same as that in the electric are,
with only a few exceptions, as, for instance, calcium, The cases men-
tioned by Lockyer are generally those where he mistakes groups of
lines for single lines or even mistakes the character of the line entirely.
Altogether there seems to be very little evidence of the breaking up
of the elements in the sun, as far as my experiments go.”

M. Janssen, in August, 1590, repeated the observations that he made
in 1885, upon Mont Blane, this time ascending to the summit. He
confirmed completely his former result that the lines of the spectrum
due to the action of oxygen in our atmosphere diminish with the alti-
tude, indicating that at the limit of the atmosphere these rays would
disappear entirely and in consequence that oxygen is not actually present
in the sun’s atmosphere. This conclusion had already received confir-
mation from a series of observations of the spectrum of an electric
light placed on the Hiffel Tower, as viewed from the observatory at
Meudon.

ECLIPSES.

Eclipses of 1889, and 1890.—During the year 1889, there were five
eclipses, three of the sun and two of the moon; and during 1890, three
eclipses, two of the sun and one of the moon. ‘Two of the solar eclipses
of 1889 were total, and one of 1890 was total over a portion of the
central line.

The Almanac records also a lunar appulse on June 2, 1890, the near-
ness of the approach and the uncertainty as to the effect of the earth’s
atmosphere rendering it doubtful whether the moon would actually
enter the earth’s shadow. Of the eclipses of the moon nothing of
especial interest has been reported. A brief summary of the observa-
tions of the solar eclipses is given below:

Total eclipse of the sun January 1, 1889.—The event of chief astro-
nomical interest in the year 1889, was the eclipse of the sun on New
Year’s day, the last total solar eclipse visible in the United States in this
century. The line of central eclipse crossed California, Nevada, Idaho,
Wyoming, Montana, and Dakota, the width of the belt of totality being
about 96 miles in California; the partial phases of the eclipse were
visible over the greater part of North America, first contact being
observed at Washington a few minutes before sunset. Ample prepa-
rations were made for utilizing the less than two minutes of totality,
and printed circulars suggesting to amateur observers the most efficient
inanner of employing the means at their command were widely circu-
lated. The most thoroughly equipped party in the field was that from
the Harvard observatory under the charge of Prof. W. H. Pickering,
at Willows, California. This party alone secured between 50 and 60
photographs taken with 14 telescopes or cameras and 8 spectroscopes,
one of the telescopes being of 13 inches aperture, the largest ever used
in observing a total solar eclipse. A party from the Lick observatory
“ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. ily!

under Mr. Keeler was at Bartlett Springs; one from Washington Uni-
versity observatory, St. Louis, under Prof. H. 8S. Pritchett at Norman;
one from Carleton College observatory under Professor Payne at Chico;
and many other available points were occupied by individual astron-
omers or photographers. At Cloverdale the Pacific Coast Amateur
Photographic Association was represented by 30 cameras.

Professor Holden has published a full report of the Lick observatory
party and its coéperators—the frontispiece being an admirable photo-
graph of the corona by Barnard, taken with a telescope of 34 inches
aperture stopped down to 1}inches. Professor’s Holden’s ‘‘ conclusions”
in which he summarizes the observations are as follows:

J. That the characteristic coronal forms seem to vary periodically as
the sun spots (and auroras) vary in frequency, and that the coronas of
1867, 1878, and 1889 are of the same strongly marked type, which cor-
responds, therefore, to an epoch of minimum solar activity.

II. That so-called “polar” rays exist at all latitudes on the sun’s
surface, and are better seen at the poles of the sun, simply because
they are there projected against the dark background of the sky and
not against the equatorial extensions of the outer corona. There ap-
pears to be also a second kind of rays or beams that are connected with
the ring-like extensions. These are parts of the “ groups of synelinal
structure” of Mr. Ranyard.

III. The outer corona of 1889 terminated in branching forms. These
branching forms of the outer corona suggest the presence of streams of
meteorites near the sun, which, by their reflected light and by their
native brilliancy, due to the collisions of their individual members,
may account for the phenomena of the outer corona.

IV. The disposition of the extensions of the outer corona along and
very near the plane of the ecliptic might seem to show that, if the
streams of meteorites above referred to really exist, they have long
been integral parts of the solar system.

V. The photographs of the corona which were taken just before con-
tact II and just after contact III prove the corona to be a solar append-
age,and are fatal to the theory that any large part of the coronal
forms are produced by diffraction. -

VI. The spectroscopic observations of Mr. Keeler show conclusively
that the length of a coronal line is not always an indication of the
depth of the gaseous coronal atmosphere of the sun at that point, and
hence to indicate the important conclusion that the true atmosphere of
the sun may be comparatively shallow.

VII. Mr. Keeler draws the further conclusion in his report
that the “ polar” rays are due to beams of light from brighter areas of
the sun illuminating the SUS uuu pares of the sun’s gaseous envel-

opes. In order that the conclusion may stand it is necessary to show
that all these ‘‘ polar” beams are composed of rectilinear rays, - -  -
An important conclusion from [the photographic and photometric]
measures seems to be that it is impracticable to photograph the corona
in full sunshine with our present plates, and that a photographic search
for Vulcan is hopeless.

The Smithsonian Institution has published a series of photographs
of the corona of this eclipse made by different observers and reduced
for convenience to a uniform scale, and has also published a suggestive
paper by Prof. F. H. Bigelow tracing a close agreement between mag-
netic lines of foree computed for the san and the curves of the polar
filaments shown upon the Pickering photograph.

Eclipse of the sun 1889, June 27.—An annular eclipse visible in the
southern part of Africa. Dr. Auwers and Dr. Gill obtained a number
of measures of the cusps with the Cape heliometer.

Eclipse of the sun 1889, December 21-22.—Three principal points were
available as observing stations: the southwest corner of the island of
Trinidad totality lasting 1™ 468; Cayenne on the coast of French
Guiana, totality 2" 3°; and Cape Lado a point on the western coast of
Africa just south of St. Paul de Loanda, totality 5™ 12%. Two expedi-
tions went out to Africa, one sent by the United States Government
under Prof. D. P. Todd, and provided with most elaborate apparatus,
and the other from the Royal Astronomical Society of England under
the direction of Mr. A. Taylor. Cloudy weather prevented both of these
parties from securing observations. Another party from the Royal
Astronomical Society under Father Perry, at the Salut Islands, was par-
tially successful as far as observations go, but resulted most disastrously
in the death of Father Perry from dysentery within a few days after
the eclipse. M. dela Baume Pluvinel was also at the Salut Islands
and secured a number of photographs. The Lick observatory party at
Cayenne, Messrs. Burnham, Schaeberle and Rockwell, were successful;
securing good photographs.

Eclipse of the sun 1890, June 17.—The annular eclipse of June 17,
1890, was central over portions of Northern Africa and Southern Asia,
and was visible as a partial eclipse over the whole of Europe. In the
southern part of Italy three-fourths of the sun’s disk was covered by
the moon. Observations partially successful were obtained by Profes-
sor Ricco at Palermo. At Canea, M. de la Baume Pluvinel secured
several photographs of the partial and annular phases, and also of the
spectrum of the annulus, the latter proving to be the same as the ordi-
nary solar spectrum.

Eclipse of the sun 1890, December 11.—A total eclipse of the sun
occurred on December 11, 1890, the central line being confined to the
ocean south of Australia. In consequence of the earth’s globular
surface, the eclipse was annular at the beginning and end, and total
between 13" 55™,3 and 16" 20,5 Greenwich mean time. In portions of
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. £59

Australia, and in Tasmania, and in New Zealand, it was visible as a par-
tial eclipse. No observation of special interest was reported.

Mr. J. M. Schaeberle has published in the Monthly Notices a theory
of the solar corona, in which he concludes that the corona is due to
the light emitted and retlected by the filaments of matter thrown out
by the sun, the corresponding forces being variable and with a period
about the same as the sun-spot period. The rays of double curvature
are explained by the rotation of the sun, and the apparent changes in
the general form of the corona by the position of the observer with
reference to the plane of the sun’s equator.

The Smithsonian Institution published in 1889 a series of re-produc.
tions of a number of photographs of the eclipse of January 1, 1889, sent
from various stations on the Pacific coast. The photographs are for
convenience of comparison reduced to a uniform scale of about 1 inch
diameter. Explanatory notes and remarks suggested by a study of the
photographs are added by Prof. David P. Todd.

Mr. H. H. Turner in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. 180, p. 385-
393) discusses the observations of the eclipse of August 29, 1886, made
at the island of Grenada.

SOLAR PARALLAX AND THE TRANSITS OF VENUS.

Transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769.—A thorough, and probably the
final, re-reduction of the observations of the transits of Venus in
1761 and 1769 has been made by Professor Newcomb in volume 2, part
5, of the astronomical papers of the American Ephemeris, a primary ob-
ject being the determination of the position of the node of Venus. The
value obtained for the solar parallax is 8/’.79 with a probable error of
+ 0.034.

Professor Harkness of the U. S. Naval Observatory has devoted sev-
eral years of work to an elaborate discussion of the solar parallax and
its related constants. His principal results are elsewhere referred to,
the definitive value for the solar parallax being 8/’.80905 + 0/.00567.

The French photographs of the transit of Venus give for the solar
parallax the value 8.80 + 0/.06.

OBSERVATORIES.

Information in regard to the work going on at astronomical observa-
tories has been derived from the reports contained in the Vierteljahrs-
schrift, in the Monthly Notices, and in Loewy’s Observatoires astro-
nomiques de Provence, and also trom the separate reports published
by a few observatories. The compiler is indebted in some instances to
directors of observatories who have communicated to him directly data
in relation to the institutions under their charge. When it has seemed
necessary to make a distinction, the year has been added to the note.

BorpDEAUX: Rayet.—Preparations are being made for observing the
zoue —20° to —25°. The photographic equatorial has been mounted.
(1889.)

BRESLAU: Galle—Chiefly magnetic and meteorological work. Small
transit used for time service.

CAMBRIDGE (England): Adams.—Mr. Newall has presented his
25-inch refractor to the university observatory, and the university
authorities have voted to spend about $11,000 on its installation near
the present observatory, and to appoint an observer, at $1,200 per
annum, to devote himself to research in stellar physics. It is under-
stood that the work with this instrument will be under the charge of
Mr. H. F. Newall.

Volume 22 of the publications has been issued and deals with the
observations from 1866 to 1869.

CAMDEN.—The amateur astronomical society at Camden, New Jer-
sey, has a small observatory, with 54-inch equatorial, transit instra-
ment, chronograph, clock, ete.

CAPE oF Goop Horr: Gill.—With the meridian circle regular ob-
servations have been made of the sun, Mercury, Venus, comparison
stars, stars occulted by the moon, ete. The heliometer has been con-
stantly in use and much attention has been given to astronomical pho-
tography. Prof. J.C. Kapteyn has measured definitively 389 negatives
of the plates of the southern photographie Durchmusternng, covering
8,769 square degrees of the sky. This work represents 489,490 obser-
vations of about 193.000 stars, or about 63 per cent. of the whole work.
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 161

Dr. Gill, the astronomer royal for the Cape, and Dr. Auwers, of Berlin,
by taking aiternate watches of observation (June 10 to August 26,
1889) secured an admirable series of observations of Victoria, which
was in an exceptionally favorable position for determining the solar
parallax. A large part of Dr. Gill’s report for 1889 is devoted to the
geodetic work which is under his direction.

CARLETON COLLEGE: Payne.—The first volume of publications con-
sists of a catalogue of 644 comparison stars observed with the Repsold
meridian circle, by Dr. Wilson.

CATANIA: Ricco.—The observatory recently founded at Catania will
be chiefly devoted to astrophysics, photography, meteorology, and seis-
mology. It contains a Merz refractor of 0™.35 (13.8 inches) aperture,
one by Cooke of 0.15 (5.9 inches), and a photographie telescope, by
Steinheil, which will be used for photographing the zone +12° to +69,
(1890.)

CHAMBERLIN: H. A. Howe.—The disks for the 20-inch refractor are
being worked by Clark, and the mounting is well advanced at the shop of
Fauth & Co., Washington. The initial publication of the new observa-
tory is a report upon observations of the eclipse of January 1, 1889.

DEARBORN: Hough.—An illustrated description of the new observa-
tory at Evanston will be found in the Sidereal Messenger for October,
1889.

DENVER.—In addition to the working observatory founded by Mr.
Chamberlin, an observatory for students is in course of erection. A
6-inch equatorial and a 3-inch transit have been ordered.

DENVER. (See, also, Chamberlin.)

DRESDEN: von Engelhardt.—Observations of nebule star-clusters and
comets. Baron von Engelhardt has recently published a second part
of his ‘Observations Astronomiques,” containing principally measures
of double stars, star charts, nebulw, and comets. (1889).

DunsinK: Ball.—A new reflecting telescope of 15 inches aperture
has been presented to the observatory by Mr. Isaac Roberts for photo-
graphic researches on stellar parallax.

DUSSELDORF: Luther.—Observatious of small planets, and compu-
tation of their ephemerides. Since 1847, 1,474 observations of 172
asteroids have been made. (1889).

EDINBURGH: Copeland.—The site for a new observatory building two
minutes of are south of the present observatory was selected in 1889.
The plans have been completed and it is hoped that the work of con-
struction will soon be begun. It is interesting to note that though the
new site is within 500 yards of the suburban railway, the porphyrite
rock of which the hill consists does not appear to transmit any percep-
tible vibration from the railway even when the heaviest trains are
passing. Dr. Becker has continued his determinations of the positions
of nebulz and work in stellar and solar spectroscopy.

162 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

GEORGETOWN: Hagen.—Observations of variable stars have been
made systematically, and experiments in photographic observations of
star transits by Father Hagen and his assistant, Father Fargis.

GENEVA: Gautier.—Chiefly engaged in testing chronometers and
watches. Observations of the sun and of comets have been made with
the equatorial. Dr. Raoul Gautier has been appointed professor of
astronomy and director of the observatory, Col. E. Gautier retaining
the title of honorary director.

GLASGOW (England): Grant. Transit-cirele observations.

GOTTINGEN: Schur.—Ueliometer used in measuring Prasepe, Ple-
iades, and double stars. (1889.)

GREENWICH: Christie—In the report for 1889 it is noted that the
observations with the transit cirele by reflexion have been much facili-
tated and improved by using an amaigamated copper-bottom mercury
trough for the artificial horizon, Two photographic objectives have
been tried, one of 6 inches aperture to be used as a pilot for the 13-inch
star-charting telescope stars, and the other of 4 inches in connection
with the 28-inch refractor.

The annual visitation in 1890 took place on June 7. The collection
of historical instruments and the new photographic equatorial espe-
cially attracted the attention of some 300 visitors present. It is pro-
posed to put up a large new building with four wings to relieve the
overcrowded condition of the elder buildings. It is expected that the
new 28-inch refractor will be installed at an early day. The 13-inch
photographic equatorial was received from Grubb on March 17, 1890,
aud was mounted and made ready for use. The astronomer royal re-
ported that the work of the observatory had proceeded without essen-
tial modification.

“The observations for the longitude of Paris made in 1888 have now
been completely reduced and the definitive results found by the French
and English observers are respectively, 9™ 21.04 and 9™ 20%.84. In
view of this unsatisfactory discordance - - - it seems desirable
that the determination should be repeated with interchange of instru-
ments as well as of observers.”

The 1887 volume of Greenwich observations contains among its ap-
pendices the ten-year catalogue deduced from observations made from
1877 to 1886. The total number of stars is 4,059, the positions being
given for 1880. 0

HARVARD COLLEGE: Pickering.—Miss C. W. Bruce, of New York,
has made a gift of $50,000 to the Harvard observatory to be applied to
the construction and maintenance of a photographic telescope having
an objective of about 24 inches aperture and a focal length of 11 feet.
The figuring of the lens has been intrusted to Alvan Clark, who has
experienced some difliculty in securing proper glass. The Bache 8-inch
telescope of similar construction has been in constant use in Cambridge
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 163

for four years, and is now in Peru photographing the southern sky ;
with it stars too faint to be seen with the 15-inch refractor have been
photographed, and a corresponding advantage is anticipated from the
increase of the aperture to 24 inches.

Volume 17 of the Annals is now completed and consists of the follow-
ing papers, which have been separately printed and distributed during
the last few years: I. Magnitudes of stars employed in various nautical
almanacs; IJ. Discussion of the Uranometria Oxoniensis; III. Photo-
metric observations of asteroids; IV. Total eclipse of the moon, 1888,
January 28; V. Total eclipse of the sun, 1886, August 29; VI. Detection
of new nebule by photography; VII. A photographic determination of
the brightness of the stars; VIII. Index to observations of variable
stars; IX. Meridian-circle observations of close north polar stars; X.

tography, has been actively pursued by the Henrys. The frontispiece
of Admiral Mouchez’s report for 1889 is a representation of the great
equatorial coudé of 18 metres focal length and 0.6 metre (23.62 inches)
aperture. Attention has been given to photographing of stellar spectra

physical observatory has been established as a department of the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington, occupying at present a tem-
166 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

porary building in the Smithsonian grounds, erected in 1889~90. The
principal instruments are a very large siderostat by Grubb, a large
spectro-bolometer, special galvanometer, and resistance box.  Ke-
searches in tellurie and astro-physics will be carried on.

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE: Miss S. J. Cunningham.—The observatory
building contains four rooms: A transit room, in which is a 3-ineh
Warner and Swasey transit and mean-time clock ; a pier room at pres-
ent utilized as asidereal clock room; a work room containing the chro-
nograph, chronometer, and a small reference library ; and the dome, in
which is a 6-inch Warner and Swasey equatorial. Connected with the
observatory is the signal service station of the state weather service,
fully provided with the necessary meteorological and other apparatus.
(1890.)

TACUBAYA: Anguiano.—The construction of the new observatory
has progressed favorably, the photographic department being entirely
finished and the instruments mounted. The photographic equatorial is
by Grubb, of the pattern adopted by the astrophotographie congress in
1889 and furnished for most of the observatories taking part in the
international chart. Among the minor apparatus added to the equip-
ment of the observatory may be mentioned a complete portable photo-
graphie outfit; a Merz polariscope for the 15-inch equatorial ; a Pritech-
ard’s wedge photometer by Hilger; a mercury artificial horizon by
Gauthier for the meridian circle; a complete meteorological outfit; a
petroleum motor and electric light installation.

In August, 1889, two additions were made to the observatory staff,
Messrs. Camilo A. Gonzalez and Guillermo Puga, who have been as-
signed to duty on the meridian circle. They have been engaged in
studying the instrumental constants and have undertaken the observa-
tion of certain stars to the tenth magnitude, conveniently situated for
reference stars for the zone of the photographic map assigned to the
Tacubaya observatory. Sr. Felipe Valle has been engaged with the
equatorial in observations of comets, asteroids, and nebule.

A series of daily observations of sun spots and facule has been made.
Photographs of the sun have been taken with the photoheliograph.
Two parties were sent out to observe the total solar eclipse of October
22, 1889, one to Yucatan and one to San Luis Potosi. (1890.)

UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY: McNair.—The reports of
the superintendents of the Naval Observatory show no material change
in the character of the work from the years immediately preceding.
On June 28, 1890, Capt. F. V. McNair succeeded Capt. R. L. Phythian
as Superintendent, Capt. McNair’s report covering the fiscal year June
30,1890. The walls of the main building for the new observatory were
practically completed by the end of 1890 ; aiso the great equatorial and
clock and observer’s rooms. The iron work for the three transit-cirele
rooms is ready. The buildings will scarcely be ready for occupancy
before the summer of 1892.

UpsaLa: Dunér.—From an extensive series of spectroscopic obser-
vations to determine the rotation period of the sun, it appears that the
period varies from 25.5 days to 38.6 days, increasing with the helio-
graphic latitude.

VIENNA (von Kuffner’s observatory) : Herz.—The latitude from obser-
vations with the Repsold meridian circle, 1889~90, is +48° 12! 46/.67.

WASHINGTON (Catholic University of America): Searle—A small
observatory has been built at the Catholic University in the suburbs
of Washington (D. C.), and is under the direction of Rev. G. M. Searle.
The position is latitude + 38° 56’ 15’; longitude 5° 8™ 08.0 west of
Greenwich. The telescope, which will be mounted in 1891 is 9 inches
aperture, 9 feet focus, glass and tube by Clacey, mounting by Saeg-
muller (Fauth & Co.). The cells and center piece of tube are made of
aluminum. A small meridian circle, and photographic and spectro-
scopic apparatus will also be provided. A 5-inch telescope is now in
use. (1890.)

physical observatory; also, U. 8S. Naval Observatory.)

WASHBURN: Comstock.—The sixth volume of publications contains
the meridian observations of 1887 and observations of double stars.

YALE: Newton.—The heliometer triangulation of the region near the
north pole has been completed, and some observations of Iris, Victoria
and Sappho have been obtained in codperation with the observatories
at the Cape of Good Hope and Leipsic, for the determination of the
solar parallax.

ZuRIcH: Wolf.—Physical observations of the sun.
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

In the fourth part of the Bulletin of the Astro-photographic con-
gress, Dr. H. C. Vogel describes the photographic refractor constructed
for the observatory at Potsdam by the Repsolds. This instrument has
two objectives; eye-piece and plate-holder are in the same tube, con-
forming to the resolutions of the congress in 1887, but the peculiarity
is in the form of mounting, which is quite different from both the Eng-
168 ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890.

lish and the French forms. The pillar that supports the polar axis is
not upright, but L-shaped, the lower part being inclined nearly in the
plane of the equator, the upper almost at right angles to this, extend-
ing toward the north pole and inclosing the polar axis. The support
possesses very great stability, and its form permits an uninterrupted
motion of the telescope in al! positions.

In Engineering for December 19, 1890, will be found a description of
the Melbourne photographic telescope made by Sir Howard Grubb.

An instrument for comparing and measuring celestial photographs,
somewhat similar to that designed by Mr. Roberts, has been devised by
Mr. Common.

An apparatus for eliminating personal equation in the observation of
sudden phenomena, such as the disappearance of a star when occulted
by the moon has been devised by Mr. 8. P. Langley, and is described
in the Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington, vol. x1.
The principle of the method consists in associating a motion, real or
apparent, of the object, with intervals of time so that the apparent posi-
tion of the object at the instant of the occurrence of any phenomenon
being noted the time of the occurrence will be known. Experiments
made with artificial stars show that it is quite possible for a compar-
atively inexperienced person to observe an occultation with a probable
error of only one-fortieth of a second.

The great Lick refractor of 36 inches diameter is to be surpassed by
one still larger, ordered for the University of Southern California, at
Los Angeles. This lens is to be 40 inches in diameter, and the crown
glass disk for the achromatic combination is now in the hands of the
Clarks, who pronounce it a remarkably fine piece of glass.

It may perhaps be mentioned here that a bill was introduced in the
United States Congress making an appropriation of $1,000,000 for a
refractor of 5 feet aperture for the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the
plan never received support from the Government astronomers.

Mr. Brashear has under way at his shop in Allegheny a 16-inch
objective for Carleton College Observatory, one of 12 inches for Brown
University, and a second of 12 inches for Mr. G. E. Hale, of Chicago.
He is also making a large spectroscope and spectrograph for Professor
Young, at Princeton, which is expected to be the finest in the United
States; a very complete spectroscope with Jena glass objectives and
prism is being made for Carleton College, and a new star spectroscope
for Lick Observatory. For the Willard photographic telescope of the
Lick Observatory, he is making an equatorial mounting with controlled
clock.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Personal equation.—The attention of astronomers interested in the

subject of personal equation should be directed to a paper prepared
" by a physiologist, Dr. E. C. Sanford, of the Johns Hopkins University,
ASTRONOMY FOR 1889, 1890. 169

and published in volume 2 of the American Journal of Psychology. An
important contribution to the astronomical side of the subject is an
investigation by Dr. Wislicenus, of the Strasburg Observatory, who has
investigated the personal equation in transit observations, not only for
a horizontal position of the telescope, but for all inclinations. By plac-
ing a small convex lens behind the ocular an artificial star is obtained
which is easily moved in the plane of the reticule with a velocity corre-
sponding to any declination. Dr. Wislicenus concludes from his experi-
ments that the inclination of the telescope has a considerable effect
upon the observer’s personal equation.

One of the essays contributed to the celebration of the Pulkowa
Jubilee was a discussion of absolute personal equation by H. G. van de
Sande Bakhuyzen. The artificial star observed was the meridian mark
